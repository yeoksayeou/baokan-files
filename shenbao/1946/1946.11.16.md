### The Initial Stage of Constitutionalism Begins: The National Assembly's Opening Ceremony is Completed; A Total of 1,355 Representatives Attend

[Special Dispatch from our Nanjing Office, 15th] The first National Assembly since the founding of the Republic of China officially opened on the morning of November 15, 1946. National flags flew throughout the capital city, bathed in sunshine and an atmosphere of harmony and joy. From 9:00 AM, the Guofu Road was filled with traffic and unprecedented liveliness, as National Representatives, government leaders, and foreign envoys arrived one after another. Inside and outside the assembly hall, greetings and laughter filled the air, while the assembly staff and reporters were extremely busy. After the representatives entered the assembly hall, they tore off the 100th section of their registration card and handed it to the registration desk, where they were received by the liaison group staff and invited to take any available seat in the assembly hall downstairs. Government officials and guests such as Yu Youren, Chiang Monlin, and Mr. and Mrs. Kong Xiangxi, more than 30 in total, were successively invited to the upper balcony, sitting in the front row on the right. The diplomatic corps, led by Brazilian Ambassador Hildebrando Accioly, was escorted by Li Jun, Director of the Protocol Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to the front row on the left of the upper balcony.

The assembly's decorations were solemn and magnificent. From the memorial archways at both ends of Guofu Road to the entrance of the assembly hall, both inside and outside the venue, everything was resplendent and dazzling. The national flags on top of the memorial archway and on the screen wall opposite the main entrance were also raised this morning, fluttering in the wind. Inside the venue, the blue, white, and red silk decorations and patterns were particularly pleasing to the eye. The four large vermilion characters "天下爲公" ("The World is for All") were horizontally displayed above the lintel of the assembly hall's main entrance, while on both sides of the hall's main entrance were the large couplet phrases "以建民國" ("To Build the Republic") and "以進大同" ("To Advance to the Great Harmony"). The decorations on the rostrum were especially grand. The backdrop was a purple-red velvet curtain with tassels, and the three walls of the rostrum were decorated with white netting. In the center of the back wall hung a large portrait of the Founding Father of the Nation, adorned with golden national flowers on top and silver ears of grain below, with national flags hanging on the left and right. A row of high-backed chairs was arranged in the central and rear sections, with long desks in front, on which were placed large purple vases filled with chrysanthemums. In front of the desks, one chair was placed on each side, and in the very center was the rostrum, covered with a purple-red velvet carpet. A microphone was placed on it, with recording seats on both sides. In the center of the platform entrance was a staircase, with two cycads at the entrance, and a lectern in front. Both sides were densely lined with madder and blue, white, and red chrysanthemums, with a small cedar tree standing at each corner, and a large national flag, illuminated by strong mercury lights, was dazzlingly luxurious and truly breathtaking.

Wu Jingheng Leads the Oath; Representatives Exceed the Legal Quorum

At 9:50 AM, Mr. Wu Jingheng, the temporary chairman of the assembly, arrived wearing a traditional long gown and mandarin jacket. He was personally welcomed from the car by Mr. Hong Lanyou, and they took a commemorative photo at the entrance of the assembly hall. At 10:00 AM sharp, Chairman Chiang, dressed in military uniform and wearing the Blue Sky White Sun Medal, arrived with his wife and secretaries Hui Shengfen and Zhou Cecong, and went straight to the lounge behind the dining hall for a short rest. Soon after, Madame Chiang also entered the venue, personally registered, and after registering on behalf of the Chairman, took her seat in the first row on the right.

At 10:15 AM, Chairman Chiang and Mr. Wu Jingheng, Hong Lanyou and others entered the rostrum through the side door on the left. First, Mr. Hong announced two matters from the National Assembly Preparatory Committee report: (1) The legal quota for National Assembly representatives was 2,050. Of these, 1,580 were officially announced by the National Government, 1,420 had registered, and 1,355 were in attendance, which exceeded the legal quorum. (2) The National Assembly preparatory meeting had recommended Chairman Chiang as the temporary chairman for the opening ceremony, but Chairman Chiang declined firmly and suggested that the oldest representative should serve. Therefore, Mr. Wu (Jingheng) was invited to take the chairman's seat amidst applause. He announced the opening of the meeting to the sound of music. After the formalities were completed, all the representatives raised their right hands to take the oath, and then Mr. Wu delivered the opening address (details in a separate article).

After Mr. Wu finished his speech, he invited Chairman Chiang of the National Government to speak. At 10:35 AM, the Chairman began by saying, "This National Assembly is an epoch-making event for the Republic of China. Zhongzheng is honored to be the Chairman of the National Government, so I have come to offer my congratulations." He then read out the full text of his speech (see separate article). At 10:55 AM, after the speech, all the representatives stood at attention to pay their respects to the Chairman. At 10:58 AM, Chairman Chiang and Old Man Wu withdrew together to the sound of music, and the opening ceremony was declared complete. China's constitutional era had thus begun.

### Mr. Wu Jingheng's Opening Speech: Hoping for the Constitution to be Created Through Concession and Consultation

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] The following is the full text of the opening speech delivered by Mr. Wu Jingheng, Chairman of the National Assembly opening ceremony on the morning of the 15th:

Chairman of the National Government, esteemed representatives, today is the happiest day for the people of the Republic of China, because we are opening an epoch-making assembly. This epoch-making assembly is the first National Representative Assembly of the Republic of China. This first National Representative Assembly was established by the Founding Father of the Nation, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, in the Outline of National Reconstruction. It is an assembly to complete absolute democracy and return power to the people. In recent years, all parties and factions in the country have urged and helped this assembly to be held. Now that it has been opened, it is enough to comfort their democratic aspirations. In particular, the national public has long hoped for the return of power as outlined in the Outline of National Reconstruction. The Founding Father of the Nation instructed his party members early on that the Kuomintang must take on this obligation and prepare to initiate it. Therefore, the Kuomintang has been conscientious and dedicated, constantly discussing the opening of this assembly. Since 1936, the procedures for convening it have been implemented, and regional representatives have been carefully elected. Suitable dates have been repeatedly set, but resistance and other factors have always been blocked by the current situation. Today, this assembly has finally been realized and gathered in one hall to open. The spirit of the Founding Father of the Nation in heaven must be very pleased. This is the first point, which is deeply gratifying.

The Founding Father of the Nation instructed the Kuomintang to exercise tutelage. The work of tutelage was originally extremely difficult, and this year is the 35th year of the Republic of China. In the fifteen years before the 16th year of the Republic of China, there was no talk of any tutelage. The Kuomintang was displaced and migrated, and the Founding Father had to reorganize his party. In the ten years from the 16th year to the 25th year, the first four or five years were met with civil wars in Jiangxi and Hubei. Even the strength for resistance in the future was lost in those few years. When the September 18th Incident of the 20th year came one after another, and from the 26th year to the present, we entered the period of resistance. Can a tutelage that exists in name only be allowed to continue? Therefore, in the 25th year, the Kuomintang yearned for the National Assembly to be opened, returning this empty name of tutelage. Moreover, according to the Founding Father's tutelage, we must learn from Yi Yin tutoring Tai Jia and the Duke of Zhou tutoring King Cheng. How easy is that? The only obligation of his party members is to make the whole country understand that the China created by him, the Republic of China, cannot do without the Three Principles of the People. We have been discussing the drafting of a constitution, and until recently, through consultations, the people of the whole country and all parties and factions recognized that the Republic of China is a republic based on the Three Principles of the People. Then, the most important goal has been achieved, relying on the joint tutelage of the people of the whole country and all parties and factions. What is the point of bearing this empty name? It is a small matter to lose the party's reputation, but it would be a great mistake for the country. Shouldn't we return power early? There are still many healthy members of the Kuomintang. If we do not allow them to follow all parties and factions to consult together in the constitutional era, consulting together to serve the people, what is the point of not opening this assembly and bearing this empty name? Today, the assembly has finally opened. This is the second point, a happy and justified joy.

The assembly is opened, and we obtain the most progressive constitution to back up the people. Then, the peace and happiness that we are all seeking can be fully achieved. However, Confucius said, "If one can govern the state with propriety and deference, what difficulty will there be?" Not only does the state need propriety and deference, but maintaining the peace and tranquility of the whole world also depends entirely on tolerance. In the past, ambitious people came out to cause trouble. Fortunately, Mr. Stalin of the Soviet Union took the lead in advocating tolerance, liberating the Third International and curbing the blind and chaotic source of the Trotskyites. Following this, President Roosevelt of the United States also used the greatest tolerance to advise Hitler, saying, "You say that our democratic politics are backward, but we do not admit that we are backward. However, we practice our democratic politics, and you can practice your Nazism." Hitler did not listen, and therefore the US Secretary of State also advised others that the world is very big and can accommodate different ideologies. President Truman also said that the unrest in the world is due to the differences in political philosophies. I think the world is not only very big, but also very long. Political philosophies are often too profound. Scholars who are highly educated do not care, but the general public is so surprised that they are unwilling to be tolerant, which leads to unrest in the world and disappointment in peace. Therefore, from now on, we should all use tolerance and endless consultation, and we will be able to achieve prosperity in our constitutional era. All parties and factions can come to the meeting based on the spirit of consultation, and help to create the most progressive constitution. This is the third point. I hope that tolerance can play a role. I would like to contribute these three points for your reference.

### The Chairman Urges Representatives to Complete the Task of Constitution-Making to Lay the Foundation for Democracy and the Rule of Law

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] The following is the full text of Chairman Chiang's speech at the opening ceremony of the National Assembly today (15th):

Esteemed Representatives,

Today, the National Assembly is holding its opening ceremony. The representatives, entrusted with the heavy responsibility of the people, have gathered in the capital to participate in the great cause of drafting the Constitution of the Republic of China. This is the beginning of China's entry into the era of democratic constitutionalism, and it is also the most solemn and grand gathering in the history of the founding of the Republic of China. Zhongzheng represents the National Government in extending a warm welcome to all of you, and expresses his sincere respect to the Assembly.

Inheriting the Legacy of the Founding Father, Completing the Goal of Nation-Building

Looking back at the purpose of the National Revolution advocated by the Founding Father, which was to revive China, establish the Republic, and implement the Three Principles of the People, so that China would be a rich, strong, healthy, and happy country owned, governed, and enjoyed by the people. The Xinhai Revolution destroyed the monarchy that had lasted for more than 4,000 years and overthrew the Manchu Qing autocracy that had lasted for more than 200 years. The Founding Father once discussed the significance of this battle, saying, "Since this battle, democratic politics in China has been recognized by the people." However, after the establishment of the Republic, the foundation was not solid, the principles were not implemented, warlords stole the country, and the chaos was endless. External aggression was frequent, and the country was in danger. Our Founding Father again led the comrades to continue the struggle, taking risks and overcoming difficulties, and continuing their efforts. His firm will clearly told the people of the whole country, first, "China is suitable for democracy," and second, "We must not pursue the name of the Republic, but pursue the reality of sovereignty in the people." The essence of the Founding Father's Principle of Democracy lies in giving the people power, that is, to enable all the people to manage the politics of the people. The establishment of the Outline of National Reconstruction clearly defined the steps of the revolutionary strategy, from military administration to tutelage and then to the constitutional era, which was to consolidate the foundation of democracy and provide a strong guarantee for the Republic. The National Government inherited the legacy of the Founding Father, so after the completion of the Northern Expedition in 1928, it actively began tutelage, and took the implementation of constitutionalism and the completion of nation-building as the greatest goal.

Regarding the preparations for the implementation of constitutionalism and the convening of the National Assembly, the responsible authorities have reported the detailed process separately. The National Government promulgated the draft constitution in May 1936, followed by the promulgation of the National Assembly Organization Law and the Election Law. The election of representatives to the National Assembly began throughout the country. Before the War of Resistance, the government had originally decided to convene the National Assembly on November 12, 1937 to enact the Constitution. At that time, the election of representatives from various regions was about to be completed, but Japan intensified its aggression and launched the July 7th Incident. In order to defend the survival of the nation, the government called on the whole country to engage in the sacred War of Resistance. Since then, the military situation has been tense, and the convening of the National Assembly has actually been difficult. However, the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee in 1939 still resolved to convene the National Assembly in November 1940, but it was eventually postponed due to the expansion of the war and the many colleagues in the Political Participation Council who advocated for a postponement. By the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee in 1943, it was resolved that "the date of the National Assembly must have a clear provision, and the National Assembly shall be convened within one year after the end of the war." However, Zhongzheng personally believes that the War of Resistance and nation-building should be completed in one battle, and the National Assembly can be convened as soon as possible, so that China's fundamental law can be formulated as soon as possible, and the National Government can realize its long-cherished wish to return power to the people as soon as possible. Therefore, at the Sixth National Congress of the Kuomintang in 1945, it was proposed to hold the National Assembly on November 12 of the same year, the 80th birthday of the Founding Father, which was approved by the Congress, and the preparations were actively launched. At that time, the idea was that the implementation of constitutionalism based on the Three Principles of the People was the greatest wish of the Founding Father's life, and the Founding Father's non-occupancy of merit in the first year of the Republic and the consistent struggle since then were all for the welfare and freedom of the country and the people. Therefore, we compatriots throughout the country want to commemorate the Founding Father, and we can only commemorate our teacher of revolution and nation-building by convening the National Assembly and enacting the Constitution. Today, our National Assembly has been convened one year after the scheduled period. Before the portrait of the great man who founded the country, we will remember the difficult struggle of our country's democratic politics, and we will surely have endless feelings of admiration and remembrance.

The Government is Tolerant and Harmonious, Upholding the Resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference

Since Japan's surrender last year, the external troubles that hindered our country's unification and democracy have been fundamentally eliminated, but there are still great difficulties in the domestic situation. The actions of armed parties have affected the peace and stability of the country, and differences in political opinions are enough to disperse the strength of post-war nation-building. The National Government deeply feels that after the country has been greatly destroyed by the eight-year War of Resistance, it must immediately carry out extraordinary construction, and the national construction must be carried out smoothly, and there must be a united and sincere effort from the whole country. Therefore, the Political Consultative Conference was convened in January this year, bringing together representatives of various parties and factions and social elites to discuss the grand plan of peace and nation-building. The 20-day meeting produced five agreements on political and military affairs, including the proposal of the five-five constitution single amendment principle, the expansion of the number of representatives to the National Assembly, and the confirmation of May 5 of this year as the date for convening the National Assembly. In these agreements, the National Government has always taken the spirit of serving the country and the people, and taken into consideration the unbearable suffering of compatriots after the war and the impossibility of delaying the great plan of nation-building, and has always adopted a tolerant and harmonious attitude, agreeing to the establishment of various agreements. After the closing of the Political Consultative Conference, it faithfully abided by the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and implemented them in order. The National Assembly Organization Law was also revised in accordance with the agreement. During this period, there were many twists and turns, which resulted in the failure to convene the meeting as scheduled on May 5, and the National Assembly that our country has been looking forward to can only be held today. For the representatives, especially the representatives who have come from afar to Beijing and have been stranded for many days, it is necessary to report the progress.

Balancing Ideal and Reality for the Long-Term Peace and Stability of the Country

The representatives who have come to the meeting today come from various provinces, cities and regions, and some have come back to the motherland from overseas to participate. The representatives represent regions or professions, have rich political experience, and have outstanding reputations in society. The nature of their production is different, and the earnest expectation that our country will realize democracy, unity, and progress is the same for everyone. In particular, those from the Northeast, which has been occupied for 14 years, and from Taiwan, which has recently been recovered, their love for the motherland and their willingness to contribute to the country must be particularly eager. I believe that you will deeply understand the famous sayings of the Founding Father, "The foundation of the country lies in the people" and "Hundreds of millions of people are tighter than the country," and clearly understand the relationship between the country and the people and the responsibility of the people to the country, and perform your constitution-making tasks according to law, and open a good start for China's constitutional government. We know that the Constitution is the fundamental law of the country, which cannot be compared with ordinary laws and regulations. The Constitution is the code of conduct for the whole country. On the one hand, it must have far-reaching ideals, and on the other hand, it must take into account the actual situation of the country. Our ideal is the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution left by the Founding Father, and the reality of our country is that the country and society have undergone long-term evolution and progress since the War of Resistance. Only a constitution that balances ideal and reality is a constitution that is suitable for the national conditions and is perfect and feasible, and it can plan for the long-term peace and stability of the country and seek true happiness for the compatriots. If we can concentrate our efforts and formulate a perfect and feasible constitution, and lay the foundation for democracy and the rule of law, then the public opinion of all regions, classes, and professions in the country, as well as the opinions of all political parties, can be expressed in accordance with the legal track.

Returning Power to the People of the Whole Country to Establish a Century-Old Foundation

In the future, all problems can be appealed to the public will of the whole people according to law for decision, and then our country will have a truly independent, free, unified, and democratic foundation, and then our compatriots can exercise true civil rights and fulfill their national obligations to promote the prosperity and progress of the country.

Zhongzheng followed the Founding Father and devoted himself to the revolution. He always took the construction of China as an independent, free, unified, and democratic country as his life's ambition. The main purpose of the eight-year War of Resistance in the past was to eliminate the invasion of violence and seek China's independence and freedom. Thanks to the efforts of our compatriots and all the soldiers, we finally achieved the final victory, and in the middle of the War of Resistance, we realized the Founding Father's legacy of abolishing inequality and concluding new, equal, and friendly treaties with the United Nations such as Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. However, looking back on my life, I still feel that it is a great regret that we have not promulgated a constitution and implemented constitutionalism since the September 18th Incident. My hope for ending tutelage, implementing constitutionalism, and completing the great cause of nation-building has not been forgotten for a moment in these 30 years. Our struggle for revolution and nation-building is for the country and the people, and it is to implement the democratic politics of the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution. This is the ultimate goal of our revolution. If this ultimate goal cannot be achieved for a day, it means that the legacy of our Founding Father has not been achieved for a day, and it also means that we have not fulfilled our responsibility to the country, the people, and the revolutionary martyrs of the past 50 years. I want to especially sincerely tell you that the Kuomintang of China was entrusted by the National Assembly in 1931 to exercise political power. The National Government exercised its governing power based on the laws of the tutelage period. In these more than ten years, there has not been a day when it has not been conscientious and dedicated, as if a heavy burden is on its shoulders. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, it is fortunate that it has not failed the trust of the people. The only thing that is hoped is to promulgate the Constitution and implement constitutionalism as soon as possible, return power to the people of the whole country, and establish a foundation for the Republic that will not be shaken for a hundred years, and this sacred and solemn constitution-making task will be jointly shouldered by our representatives.

Esteemed Representatives, our National Assembly this time can be said to have been opened after countless difficulties and thousands of twists and turns. We remember the hardships of the Founding Father's leadership of the revolution and the successive struggles of the revolutionary martyrs. Our representatives must ensure that this conference does not fail the legacy of the Founding Father and the revolutionary martyrs. We recall the past, suffering from the obstruction of enemy aggression, which delayed our great cause of nation-building. Our representatives must also do their best to complete this sacred task in order to comfort the souls of the soldiers and civilians who sacrificed for the country in the eight-year War of Resistance. At the same time, we think of the political unrest and the suffering of the people today, which are all caused by the failure to establish the foundation of the country. This time, the drafting of the Constitution is a plan to stabilize the foundation of the country and realize the rule of constitutional government. The mission of our representatives is even more solemn and important. Zhongzheng is honored to participate in today's grand meeting. I sincerely pray that all representatives will work hard for the country and wish the conference success. (End)

There are also news such as the list of representatives to the National Assembly submitted by the Youth Party, see page 2.

### Sidelights of the Assembly

— Our Special Correspondent

The opening ceremony began at ten o'clock in the morning. Early in the morning, the streets of Nanjing were still deserted with few pedestrians, but the cars on Guofu Road were already coming and going in an endless stream, and the news reporters had been mobilized.

Representatives Gracious and Courteous

The main entrance of the assembly hall, with its vermilion-lacquered large round pillars, the brilliant national flags, and the blue sky, contrasted sharply and stood out. The gold badges and vermilion sashes of the representatives glittered brilliantly in the sunlight. Everyone was smiling, gracious, and courteous. This was a grand gathering of the nation's young talents, and Chinese history was unfolding a new page today.

Inside the assembly hall, three rows of blooming blue, white, and red chrysanthemums were arranged on the left and right sides of the rostrum. Secretary-General Hong, in a blue robe and black mandarin jacket, directed the proceedings. Around half-past nine, the representatives began to enter the hall one after another. The seats for foreign envoys, guests, and government leaders were upstairs, and the most eye-catching, of course, was President Yu, with his silver beard fluttering. As the opening ceremony began, Ambassador Stuart lowered his head as if deep in thought.

Venerable Elder beaming

Elder Wu arrived early as well. Today, he truly looked like the officiant at a wedding ceremony, appearing even more prosperous than when he was in Shanghai. Dressed in a blue satin cotton robe and black silk mandarin jacket, he entered the hall with a beaming smile, greeting acquaintances with warm words.

At ten minutes past ten, the chairman walked onto the rostrum amidst enthusiastic applause. Today, the chairman was wearing a yellow ceremonial uniform and white gloves, his steps were nimble, and he was solemn and resolute.

Before the official start of the opening ceremony, Secretary-General Hong, who had spent countless efforts preparing for the National Assembly, reported that the number of National Assembly representatives was two thousand and fifty. The government had officially announced the names of one thousand five hundred and eighty. As of ten o'clock in the morning of the fifteenth, one thousand four hundred and twenty had registered, and one thousand three hundred and fifty-five were present today. Previously, the representatives had expressed in discussions that they would not invite the Chairman of the National Government to be the Chairman of the Assembly, but the Chairman requested to resign. Therefore, the representative with the highest seniority was chosen as the Chairman of the Assembly, and Representative Wu Jingheng was the most senior. When Elder Wu's name was mentioned, the representatives applauded thunderously. Thus, Elder Wu took the chairman's seat, and the opening ceremony officially began.

Various Oath-Taking Postures

When Elder Wu led the representatives in taking the oath, each representative raised their right hand, many with clenched fists, their postures both firm and gentle, which was quite beautiful and impressive. When reciting the oath, some spoke in Mandarin, some in Cantonese, and some in Hokkien. The scene in the hall was like a tide rushing against rocks, and the expressions of the representatives were all very devout.

After Elder Wu delivered his address, he invited Chairman Chiang to speak, and the entire audience listened with bated breath. At this time, the photographers were the busiest, with one American photographer taking more than a dozen shots in a row. When Elder Wu was speaking, a photographer's flashbulb exploded, causing a stir throughout the hall.

There were many mercury lamps on both sides of the hall. China Electric was filming this great moment, and soon, compatriots across the country would be able to see how solemn this grand ceremony was.

Standing Up to Pay Respects

After Chairman Chiang finished his speech, all the representatives put forward a temporary motion to stand up and pay respects to Chairman Chiang for his hard work and great achievements. Immediately, all the representatives stood up in solemnity, and Chairman Chiang also stood up to return the salute. At this moment, the ceremony concluded amidst music, and the representatives also left the hall one after another. They went outside and handed the signed and stamped oath papers to the female staff in two counters outside the hall. Many representatives crowded in front of the temporary post office to buy commemorative stamps. President Sun stood on the stairs and spoke with Secretary-General Shao for a moment, as if waiting for something, but in the blink of an eye, he left again.

Reporters Surround Elder Wu

At the entrance of the assembly hall, Elder Wu was surrounded by some reporters who requested his autograph, making it almost impossible for him to move. It was not until the security personnel arrived that he was freed. The wireless loudspeakers were instructing the representatives on how to board the National Assembly transportation vehicles specially assigned to pick up and drop off the representatives. In addition, the representatives' cars and jeeps, with five-pointed stars and long strips of paper as entry and exit passes, also departed one after another. The assembly hall became quiet again.

Today's opening ceremony started at fifteen minutes past ten and ended at fifty minutes past ten. I asked many representatives, "When will the preparatory meeting be held?" Their answers were almost unanimously, "We are waiting to see the news in the papers, we still need you to tell us."

### Resolutely Submitting the List of Representatives The Youth Party Participates in the National Assembly Mr. Zuo Shunsheng Issues a Statement on the Situation

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] The Youth Party's list of participants in the National Assembly was submitted on the 15th. At 8:00 PM, the National Assembly's Continued Selection of Representatives Committee held a meeting in the National Government Auditorium, attended by Wu Fengchang, Chen Lifu, Zhang Lisheng, Yu Youren, and Jia Jingde, presided over by Wu Jingheng, to discuss and approve the Youth Party's list, which will be announced tonight.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] The Youth Party resolutely participated in the National Assembly, and the list has also been submitted. This reporter specifically approached the party's Minister of Propaganda, Mr. Zuo Shunsheng, to inquire about the party's decision to participate and the reasons. Mr. Zuo issued the following statement on the situation: "Since the 21st of last month, individuals from the Third Force, invited by the government, came to Nanjing together. After more than twenty days of running around and discussing, there have been many moving facts. Although the crux of the problem is generally clear, there are still some disagreements between the government and the Chinese Communist Party that cannot be resolved. Even within the Third Force itself, there are differences in opinions. Until 8:00 PM on the 11th of this month, on the eve of the originally scheduled opening of the National Assembly, no unanimous agreement could be reached. Our party and some social elites then decided to indicate that they could nominate a list, but still hoped that the government would postpone the opening date by a few days for a final effort. This is the reason why the opening date of the National Assembly was postponed by three days. Unfortunately, during these final three days, the Democratic League made a resolution not to participate temporarily, and the Chinese Communist Party strongly advocated for the cessation of the assembly. In order to promote the implementation of democratic constitutionalism, and to act in concert with some social elites, and even more unwilling to cause excessive disappointment to the people of the whole country who are increasingly mired in deep water and scorching fire, we resolutely submitted the list of our party's representatives. Tracing back to several years ago, we have spared no effort in mediating and working for national unity. The purposes we have cherished are: first, to strive for peace; second, to promote unity; and third, to realize democracy. This is not only something that all parties in the government and opposition agree on without any dissent, but also something that the people of the whole country are eagerly expecting. The difference is that some people believe that participating in the National Assembly will undermine peace, while we believe that since the cessation of hostilities has already been implemented, only by unanimously participating in the National Assembly can there be hope for continued maintenance of peace. Some people believe that participating in the National Assembly will lead to division, while we believe that division has been a de facto reality for several years, and only by unanimously participating in the National Assembly can there be a possibility of promoting national unity. Some people believe that participating in the National Assembly will hinder democracy, while we believe that only by passing the revised draft constitution of the Political Consultative Conference in this National Assembly, and obtaining the support of the entire country, can democracy obtain a powerful guarantee. The completion of these several major goals is truly the fundamental position of our party since its founding. As for how the date of the National Assembly was decided today, and whether the reorganization of the National Government and the Executive Yuan occurred before the opening of the National Assembly or a few days later, it is indeed related to the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, but compared to the larger and more distant goals listed above, it is still secondary. I dare to announce these intentions to the people of the country.

### Nanyang Siang Pau Publishes Editorial Urging the Communist Party to Come to Their Senses

[Central News Agency, Singapore, 15th] Today, the Nanyang Siang Pau here published an editorial on the opening of the National Assembly, making a final appeal to the Chinese Communist Party. The newspaper stated: Today is an important beginning for the Chinese Communist Party, and it is earnestly hoped that its leaders will come to their senses, hand over their troops, and participate in the National Assembly. If the Chinese Communist Party believes that after a formal military defeat, it can carry out guerrilla warfare, it is truly foolish. This kind of tactic is purely destructive and does not benefit the goals of the Communist Party at all, only increasing the suffering of the general population.

Whenever a person is illegally arrested or detained by any agency other than a court, the executing agency should immediately, in accordance with the provisions of the Habeas Corpus Law, inform the person and their close relatives of the reasons for the arrest or detention within 24 hours. Furthermore, the executing agency should, after receiving a notice or writ of habeas corpus from the court, respond according to the schedule or deliver the arrested or detained person within 24 hours. Those who intentionally obstruct will be punished according to law. The courts receiving applications should also fulfill their duties and not delay or perfunctorily handle the matter, so as not to lose the public's trust in the law.

### Zhang Qun Returned to the Country Yesterday Arriving in Shanghai He Took a Train to Nanjing at 11:00 PM That Night He Met with Truman and Eisenhower in the United States

[Our Report] Zhang Qun, Chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Government, along with his wife, Dr. Dong Bingqi, and Secretary Liu Yuye, returned to the country from Tokyo on American military aircraft C45 number 5584 the night before yesterday, arriving safely at Jiangwan Airport in this city at 9:00 AM yesterday morning. Those who went to welcome him included Mayor Wu Guozhen, former Mayor Qian Dajun, Secretary-General of the City Party Headquarters Xie Renzhao, Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Office in Shanghai Chen Guokang, Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng representing Sun Qinchi, Deputy Secretary-General of the Central Planning Bureau He Qian, Tianjin Mayor Du Jianshi, Director-General of the National Government's Budget Bureau Xu Kan representing Ye Xinmin, Chief of the City Government's Public Relations Section Zhang Bide, Zhang's eldest son Ji Zheng, and more than 40 of his friends and reporters from various newspapers.

Zhang was smiling and full of energy, wearing a dark green suit with a light gray overcoat. He then shook hands and thanked each of the welcomers and, at the request of reporters, made a short statement in the airport reception room. Zhang first said: "I went abroad on September 10th for treatment of poisonous cancer, arriving in Washington on the 14th and transferring to a New York hospital. After being hospitalized for 25 days and undergoing five operations, I was finally cured. I originally intended to investigate construction projects in the United States, but I was unable to do so due to a telegram from the government. However, I did go to Canada once to inspect water conservancy projects, so that I could learn from them after returning to the country. At the same time, the Canadian Prime Minister was very interested in the water conservancy projects in Sichuan Province of our country and expressed his willingness to provide assistance. During my time in the United States, I was deeply grateful for the concern of friends in that country for my health." Zhang also said: "In the United States, I met with President Truman and had frank discussions on everything. I also met with General Eisenhower at the Department of Defense. The United States' policy towards China will not change." Zhang said that he had not heard of the rumors about him being appointed as the head of the Executive Yuan. Zhang continued: "I have been abroad for almost two months and am quite unfamiliar with the situation in the country." Finally, Zhang mentioned that the American zoos highly value our country's precious animal, the panda. The previous panda had grown large and weighed over 300 pounds. American friends were very sorry to hear about the death of the panda in Shanghai this autumn and still hope to send another one next year. In addition, the United States and San Diego are also requesting pandas, which shows that this animal is quite reputable internationally." He was then escorted by Mayor Wu to his private residence on Shaanxi South Road and took a train to Nanjing at 11:00 PM that night.

### Editorial: Expectations for the National Assembly Representatives

— After reading Chairman Chiang's Speech

The National Assembly, watched by the world and anticipated by the nation, has finally opened yesterday morning after countless twists and turns. This is the most important day in the history of the Republic of China, and it marks the beginning of our country's political transition towards constitutionalism. All people who yearn for peace and seek democracy are expressing joy and rejoicing at the opening of this National Assembly, harboring full of hope; everyone hopes that this National Assembly can formulate a practical and feasible democratic constitution, laying a solid foundation for the country's long-term plan. After listening to the speech delivered by Chiang at the opening ceremony of the National Assembly, we are even more convinced of the importance of the National Assembly's responsibility, and we believe that it will achieve satisfactory results, but in this historic opening ceremony of the National Assembly, our common people did not see the participation of the CCP, which cannot but be disappointing and regrettable.

In the current China, what is urgently needed is peace, democracy, and unity; but how to achieve peaceful, unified democracy? The only way is to embark on the right track of constitutionalism. Therefore, convening the National Assembly to formulate a constitution is indeed what the people of the whole country have been longing for day and night, and it is also the most urgent political task at present. Except for those with ulterior motives, there is absolutely no reason to oppose it. The CCP's refusal to participate in the National Assembly and its further expressions, attempting to put the country in a state of division, only show its futility and will never win the sympathy of the people. It has no impact whatsoever on the convening of the National Assembly and the completion of its sacred task of constitution-making. As for the Democratic League's willingness to echo the CCP's claims, it not only loses its original position but will also be despised by the people. Fortunately, the government convened the National Assembly this time, based on its spirit of tolerance, treating the CCP and the Democratic League with sincerity. The repeated postponements of the National Assembly were the government's expression of its constant hope for their participation in the National Assembly. Even after the opening of the National Assembly, their representative seats are still reserved, and they can report and participate at any time. Therefore, we still hope that the Democratic League can put the country first, realize its mistakes, and participate in the National Assembly as soon as possible to complete the great task of constitution-making.

This National Assembly is the first National Assembly of the Republic of China, equivalent to the National Constituent Assembly of France, or the American Constitutional Convention convened after the independence of the United States. Its sole task is to formulate a practical and feasible democratic constitution. Turning through the constitutional history of various countries and tracing the process of constitution-making in our country, it is not difficult to know that constitution-making is indeed a difficult task. The quality of the constitution itself has a very close relationship with the future of the country. As the saying goes, "a bad constitution is worse than no constitution"; at the same time, the success or failure of constitution-making is the key to the country's rise and fall. The constitution to be formulated by this National Assembly not only requires the realization of democracy, but also this constitution concerns peace and unity. The responsibility borne by the representatives of the National Assembly is indeed too great. In his speech at the opening of the National Assembly, Chairman Chiang earnestly warned all the representatives, saying: "I hope that when the representatives create the constitution, everyone can cooperate wholeheartedly, accommodate opinions from all parties, and establish a perfect and feasible constitution."

What is a constitution? It is the fundamental law of the country, which concerns the foundation of the country. As Chairman Chiang said: "The constitution is the fundamental law of the country, a code to be followed by the whole country. On the one hand, it must have far-reaching ideals; on the other hand, it must take into account the actual situation of the country." In today's democratic era, the people are the main body of the country. Of course, everyone has requirements and opinions on the ideals of the fundamental law and the actual situation of the country. Therefore, it is not an unexpected phenomenon that complex opinions are formed on the nature and spirit of the constitution, but it is inevitable in any country. Taking the United States as an example, when the United States convened the Constitutional Convention in 1787, the American people also had complex opinions on the draft constitution, and the representatives of each state had their own prejudices. Later, thanks to the efforts of American politicians, the Constitutional Convention was finally passed, and it is still the fundamental law of the United States. The unity, prosperity, and strength of the United States rely on this authentic constitution, even though it has never been unanimously considered satisfactory by the people of the whole country. But the US Constitution was created by reconciling national opinions. This historical fact of constitution-making by a friendly country can serve as a model for our country's constitution-making and constitutional implementation today.

Fortunately, the people of our country can all believe in the Three Principles of the People of the Founding Father. Even the CCP and the Democratic League also publicly recognize that they are willing to take the Three Principles of the People as the highest principles of the country. Therefore, the people of the whole country have no disapproval in principle of any constitution drafted in accordance with the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution. There are only minor differences, unlike the people of other countries, who have no standards for the drafting of the constitution. The CCP's opposition to the National Assembly's constitution-making and the Democratic League's refusal to participate are all with ulterior motives. When the National Assembly meets to discuss the constitution this time, not only is there a draft constitution of the Fifth Five-Year Plan drafted by the Legislative Yuan in accordance with the teachings of the Founding Father and promulgated by the National Government, which can be used as a basis for discussion; but also the Several Principles of Amendment to the Draft Constitution proposed by the Political Consultative Conference Comprehensive Group have been drafted by Wang Chonghui and others in accordance with these several principles of amendment, which is a revised draft of the Fifth Five-Year Plan. This draft was drafted by accommodating the opinions of various parties and factions and social figures, and can also be used for comparative research and choice. In terms of the theory of political science, any system has its advantages and disadvantages. There is no absolute standard. The choice of system depends on the wise choice of the representatives of the National Assembly. Taking the central political system as an example, the American-style presidential system and the British and French-style cabinet system have their own advantages and disadvantages in theory. Which system should we adopt after all? We should have a broad vision, face reality, and consider which political system is most suitable for our country's national conditions? Which political system is most practical and feasible? Ten thousand should decide which political system to adopt. Chairman Chiang also gave clear instructions on this level: "Only a constitution that takes into account both ideals and reality is a constitution that is suitable for the national conditions and is perfect and feasible, and can seek long-term peace and stability for the country and real happiness for the compatriots."

In short, the constitution is the fundamental law of the country, concerning the future rise and fall and survival of the country. The National Assembly has the task of making the constitution, and the responsibility of the representatives is really too great. Therefore, we hope that the representatives of the National Assembly must consider carefully and humbly when discussing the constitution, and especially should put aside personal and group prejudices and be able to tolerate the opinions of others. In addition to taking the Three Principles of the People as the fundamental principle of constitution-making, we must also summarize everyone's wisdom and reconcile opinions from all aspects. We must make this Chinese Magna Carta a constitution that can truly represent the people of the whole country. There is a common motto in ancient and modern times, both at home and abroad, that is, "be careful in planning the beginning of things." The success or failure of any cause is determined at the beginning. The convening of this National Assembly is the first step for our country to move towards democracy, and we must be especially cautious. Therefore, after the opening of the National Assembly, our common people have to express our deep expectations to all the representatives of the National Assembly, hoping that all the representatives of the National Assembly can shoulder this sacred and solemn task to formulate a practical and feasible democratic constitution for the country, so that our country's politics will embark on the road of peace and democracy, and open a good beginning, so as to promote the prosperity and progress of the country.

### Development of the Trieste Port Issue

Since the Council of Foreign Ministers meeting in New York on November 4, it has encountered two of the most difficult problems: first, the international navigation of the Danube River, and second, the international co-management of the Trieste port. According to a report from Agence France-Presse in New York on the 13th, the Council of Foreign Ministers has reached a three-point agreement on the Trieste port issue: The decisions of the Paris Peace Conference on the Trieste Free Zone and its status should be maintained. The Council of Foreign Ministers welcomes any agreement that Italy and Yugoslavia may reach through direct negotiations, but on the condition that this agreement does not violate the resolutions of the Paris Peace Conference. The Council of Foreign Ministers will discuss the Trieste port plan proposed by France point by point starting from the 13th of this month.

These three points of agreement seem to be contradictory, because the Council of Foreign Ministers on the one hand allows Italy and Yugoslavia to talk directly, on the other hand, it is discussing the Trieste port plan proposed by France point by point; on the one hand, it welcomes the agreement that Italy and Yugoslavia may reach through direct negotiations, on the other hand, it requires them not to violate the resolutions of the Paris Peace Conference. But from the actual situation, since the Council of Foreign Ministers is meeting, if the Trieste port issue is not resolved, the Italian Peace Treaty will inevitably be delayed. Of course, the Council of Foreign Ministers cannot stop the meeting and wait for the uncertain direct negotiations between Italy and Yugoslavia. In the past, during the Paris Council of Foreign Ministers and the Paris Peace Conference of Twenty-One Nations, the Trieste port issue was the most contentious, almost causing the conference to stall. Fortunately, thanks to France's compromise, the Council of Foreign Ministers and the Paris Peace Conference finally passed it in the afternoon. The current Council of Foreign Ministers should naturally not easily abandon the hard-won resolutions of the Paris Peace Conference and re-ignite international disputes.

The resolutions of the Paris Peace Conference have been agreed to by all countries in principle after being passed by more than two-thirds of the votes. The difficulties in implementation are first due to the stalemate between the people of Italy and Yugoslavia, and second due to the competition between the Soviet Union and the British and American forces. Yugoslavia, in the posture of a victorious country, although it has a smaller population in Trieste, believes that Trieste should be incorporated into its territory. Italy believes that Trieste was originally its own territory and cannot be easily ceded. The two sides refuse to compromise, and riots and bloodshed continue to occur. The emotions of the people are very激ang, and the governments of both countries dare not easily give in. Under such circumstances, if Trieste is to be stabilized and riots are eliminated, there is no better way than an international organization with a strong co-management government for the time being.

As far as the international situation is concerned, Yugoslavia is actually a vassal of the Soviet Union. The more control Yugoslavia has over Trieste, the more Soviet influence will penetrate, which is not what Britain and the United States want. In the past, all disputes concerning Trieste in the Council of Foreign Ministers and the Paris Peace Conference were centered on this point. Although France's principle of international co-management has been approved, however, in the details of implementation, any aspect has many opportunities to gain control. For example, demarcation, stationing troops, government organization, and election methods all require the Soviet Union and the United States and Britain, Yugoslavia and Italy, to make concessions to each other before an agreement can be reached.

Agence France-Presse reporters believe that the Trieste port agreement "makes the political horizon brighter." It also said: "The breakthrough in the deadlock is due to the Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's compromise attitude." When the Council of Foreign Ministers began on the afternoon of the 12th, the Soviet Union suggested that the Trieste port issue be handed over to the foreign ministers' representatives for further study, but the other foreign ministers opposed it, and the Soviet foreign minister immediately agreed to start discussing the matter on the 13th. From these signs, it may be possible to get through it. As for the other biggest difficulty, the stalemate between Italy and Yugoslavia, because both sides have expressed their willingness to negotiate directly, there seems to be hope for improvement.

According to a message from the Soviet News Agency in New York on the 12th, the improvement of Italian-Yugoslav relations is due to the talks between Yugoslav President Tito and Italian Communist Party leader Togliatti, which provided a positive factor for a general discussion of mutual issues on a friendly basis. Togliatti carried Tito's proposal, advocating that Italy retain Trieste, and that Grozia, the second largest city in the province of Venezia Giulia, be ceded to Yugoslavia. Whether Italy accepts Tito's proposal is of course still a question, because the cession of new land will inevitably be opposed by the Italian people. However, this at least proves that Yugoslavia no longer insists on annexing Trieste. And from riots and struggles to meeting negotiations, it is a progress after all.

The Trieste port issue, whether from the perspective of relations between the Soviet Union and the United States and Britain, or from the perspective of Italian-Yugoslav relations, has had new developments. Now, the Council of Foreign Ministers and direct negotiations between Italy and Yugoslavia are held simultaneously, using a two-pronged approach, which may be able to establish a solution that can be passed by all parties.

[Report from Haining by this newspaper] The seawall outside the South Gate of Mu County at "Zidoupantou" had sudden cracks months ago due to years of disrepair, and the situation was dangerous. The residents of Haining City repeatedly appealed, requesting immediate repairs, otherwise, if an accident occurred, the entire city would be flooded. However, due to the time-consuming transportation of materials and machinery, repairs have not yet been carried out. At around 8 pm on the 12th, the "Jue" character stone seawall was finally collapsed by the tide, with a gap of seven meters. Those that did not collapse were also crumbling. The tidal water rushed in and flooded the area outside the South Gate. The town government convened an emergency meeting and urgently telegraphed the Provincial Seawall Engineering Bureau, requesting that repairs be carried out quickly. Otherwise, if further damage occurs, it will be irreparable and cause an unprecedented tragedy.

### County Administration Moves Forward With Difficulty: Five Key Problems Summarized: Jiangsu Province Second District County Administration Review Conference: Resolutions on Public Security, Streamlining Government, and Other Policies

[Report from Suzhou by this newspaper on the 15th] The Second District County Administration Review Conference opened at the Commissioner's Office at 9 am on the 15th. The attendees included Commissioner and District Security Commander Xu Baoguang, Deputy Commander Xia Boxun, the heads of various sections, and 20 people, including the magistrates of the eight counties. After the ceremonial greetings, Commissioner Xu gave an opening speech, indicating that the counties should ensure social security in the autumn when the suppression of bandits has not yet been completed and winter defense is continuing, and under the potential of a serious economic crisis in various places, and should make every effort to improve the autonomy of the Township-level organizations.

Reports from Various Counties

After the speech, the county magistrates successively presented detailed reports on the civil administration, finance, education, construction, and security departments, and painfully stated that the county administration has been in a difficult situation for the past year. The key problems are shocking to the listeners. To sum up, there are five points:

(1) Although finance is said to have restored the three-level system, in fact, there is no finance at the county level. For example, the land tax is 50% retained by the upper level. This number is based on the official quota rather than the actual collection. If it cannot be collected, the local area will have no income.

(2) The treatment of county-level personnel is even lower than that of the county-level tax collection offices, which has a great impact on the efficiency of promoting administration.

(3) Township expenses are not allocated at all, and township organs are nominal. General personnel are engaged in resolving civil disputes every day, and are indifferent to the promotion of government orders.

(4) Troops passing through or stationed treat the county government as an adjutant, responding to errands and being exhausted.

(5) The county magistrate has no power to control personnel and economy, and is restricted everywhere, making it impossible for the county government to exercise autonomy. There are countless other trivial and unspeakable secrets. The emotions of the county magistrates are extremely enthusiastic.

Discussion Proposals

The conference took a break at noon and began discussing proposals at 2:30 pm. The conclusions are briefly recorded as follows:

(1) Public Security Problem: In order to ensure the smooth progress of prevention, suppression, and reform, in addition to the continued operation of the cadre training centers in various counties, joint prevention and suppression should be effectively strengthened. The District Security Command should transfer a platoon of security teams from each county, concentrate training, and unify command and coordination, with their own meals.

(2) Land Tax Problem: The promulgated city scales have been inspected and each tax unit is one jin short. It is estimated that the land tax quota will be more than 2,000 dans less in each county, and compensation should be requested. The provincial government should be required to reasonably adjust warehouse losses, transportation losses, and miscellaneous expenses. In addition, the central government should purchase the grain tax from various counties with reference to market prices and pay in installments in different places.

(3) Treatment Problem: The treatment of county-level civil servants should be submitted to the government for adjustment, at least to maintain a balance with the tax collection personnel.

(4) Anti-Smoking Problem: The penalties for the two crimes of trafficking and smoking are different. It should be submitted to the province for correction to show fairness.

(5) Temporary Military Service Conscription: There are many overly picky rejections. A supervision agency should be organized during the official conscription next year.

(6) Social economy is in a difficult situation every day. The budget for the next year should be requested from the provincial government to minimize the competent departments' undertakings as much as possible to make it practical, and to simplify the government orders to give the people a chance to recuperate.

(7) Pay attention to township production to provide sufficient township expenses and improve the infrastructure organization. The conference ended at around 6 pm.

### Western Zhejiang Salt Production Will Be Eliminated

[Report from Hangzhou by this newspaper on the 15th] The Liangzhe Salt Administration originally administered seven counties each in Jiangxi and Anhui, the entire province of Zhejiang, and the city of Shanghai. The production area is the entire province of Zhejiang. In the western part of Zhejiang, the salt farmers and salt merchants directly negotiated prices. In the eastern part of Zhejiang, because there were more salt farmers and a larger amount of production, the Salt Administration negotiated the price with the salt farmers in order to prevent the salt from hurting the flourishing farmers during the slack season, and then sold it to the salt merchants. It is learned that starting from January next year, Liangzhe will universally adopt the system of direct price negotiation between salt farmers and salt merchants. The Administration has stored a large amount of edible salt in Lishui, Qu County, and Chun'an. If the price of salt is deliberately raised during the peak season, it can be released to stabilize it. It is also heard that some production areas in western Zhejiang will be forced to eliminate them in addition to natural elimination because the production volume is too small, which affects agricultural production and wastes manpower.

### Bengbu's Salt Reserves Increase: High Transportation Costs and Rising Prices

[Report from Bengbu by this newspaper] Bengbu is a distribution center for Huai salt to the north of the Huai River and to the eastern counties of Henan. Since the interruption of the eastern section of the Longhai Railway and the obstruction of the salt river, transportation has been suspended. At the end of last month, there were only 20,000 dan of Huai salt in the city, and there was a shortage of supply. In view of this, the Salt Administration has strengthened the sea transportation of Huai salt to maintain the people's food, and transferred the original loan quota of 1.9 billion yuan for the five Strict Salt Provinces of Zhejiang salt to be used in the Anhui area first. The original amount of salt distributed to Bengbu City in October, November, and December was 240,000 dan. Later, after the salt merchants' efforts, another 116,000 dan were added, for a total of 356,000 dan. After the sea transportation was strengthened, the sources of Huai salt have been continuously transported to Bengbu in the past half month. There are now a total of 70,000 dan of salt in the city. However, recently, due to the gradual increase in transportation costs, the transportation cost per dan has reached 10,000 yuan, so the retail price per catty has also risen to 340 yuan.

### Wu Xing Trades Raise Wages Without Authorization

[Our Newspaper Wu Xing News] In this county, the plastering, carpentry, painting, tailoring, and barbering trades have all raised their wages without authorization.

(3) For barbering, the highest price for a Western-style or flat-top haircut in first-class shops is 1,200 yuan, with extra charges for oiling and blow-drying. Prices should be reduced for second and third-class shops.

### Request for Repair of Long-Broken Water Pipe

There is an underground water pipe at the intersection of Kangding Road and Yanping Road, opposite the gate of the Municipal Yanping Road Elementary School and next to the bamboo fence, which suddenly broke at the end of last year. After being repaired, it unexpectedly broke again not long after, although not as severely as before. Clear water flowed out gurglingly, but for some reason, no one seemed to care. Later, the author left Shanghai for some business, and only returned after more than half a year. To my surprise, the broken water pipe was still unrepaired, and clear water was overflowing as before! Moreover, the road surface has been eroded into a ditch after being flooded for a long time. The clear water flows across Kangding Road, causing the road surface to be constantly damp. Recently, people have been urinating there, making it extremely dirty! As spring approaches, both sanitation and transportation are hampered. We respectfully request that the Municipal Bureau of Public Works and the Water Supply Company send personnel to inspect and repair it, and the residents there will be immensely grateful.

### Further Explanation for Building a Bridge Across the Huangpu River

Regarding the construction of transportation connecting the east and west sides of the Huangpu River, some advocate building a tunnel, while others advocate building a bridge. Opinions are divided, and no decision has been heard of yet.

In my humble opinion, building a bridge for this project is quite difficult because large ships frequently enter and exit the Huangpu River. The bridge must be extremely high, and the bridge abutments must be extended for several miles. Moreover, the ground in this area is sinking, and the bridge itself is too heavy, so the bridge piers (supports) may sink (this has already happened to the bridges across the Suzhou Creek). For these reasons, it can be seen that building a bridge is impossible. If a tunnel is built, the project will be huge and full of difficulties, and the cost will be enormous, which the municipal authorities cannot afford. Moreover, construction will take a long time, and there will be no end to completion. Therefore, my humble opinion is that building a floating pontoon bridge is the most suitable. As for this type of construction, a three-dimensional design can be adopted. My ideas are as follows:

The lower level is a pier, 80 feet wide and 120 feet long, consisting of several connected sections, equipped with hoisting equipment, which can serve as both a bridge and a pier (the middle two sections must be equipped with engines to open them when large ships pass through).

The upper level is a pedestrian walkway, with lightweight buildings built on both sides, like floating hotels, which can also be used as teahouses, bars, and various shops.

Each pier connection must have a gap of several feet, with an activity bridge to connect them tightly, to allow smaller vessels to pass through. In this way, construction will be easier, and it will be practical. I wonder what the municipal authorities think? (He Xigeng)

### Serious Situation in Northern Greece: Prime Minister Holds Emergency Meeting with Military Leaders and Opposition Parties: Former Foreign Minister Declares Current Situation Could Trigger World Conflict

[News from Our Newspaper] London Broadcasting, 15th: Conflicts have occurred on the border between Greece and Yugoslavia, and the situation is very serious. The Deputy Minister of National Defense of Greece has flown to the Macedonian front. According to Greek officials, three days ago, the town of Skra, located six miles from the Yugoslav border in Greece, was occupied by the Southern Army, but after a counterattack by the Greek army, it retreated to the Southern border. The Greek side will lodge a complaint with the UN General Assembly regarding this incident.

[United Press Athens, 14th] According to the Thessaloniki Military News, two days ago, guerillas attacked Skra Village on the Greek border and a border outpost in Yugoslavia, causing the deaths of 50 men, women and children, and 43 soldiers. Greek military leaders and opposition party leaders held an emergency meeting with Prime Minister Tsaldaris tonight to discuss the serious situation in the north. The Governor of Macedonia, Loupoulos, also flew here from Thessaloniki on a special plane to attend the meeting. After the meeting, it was announced that the Army Chief of Staff and government representatives will fly to Thessaloniki tomorrow to inspect the chaotic situation on the ground.

[Reuters London, 14th] Former Greek Foreign Minister Sophianopoulos said in an exclusive interview with our correspondent: The current situation in Greece could trigger a conflict between Greece and its northern neighbors, or even a world conflict. The civil war zone is gradually expanding from the provinces of Thessaly and Macedonia in the north to Sparta in the south, and British troops are also in danger of joining the battle. My visit to London this time is to draw attention to this serious situation and to ask the United Kingdom to morally support the organization of a united government in Greece, as organizing a coalition of parties is the only way to avoid extreme crisis. I believe that today is the mature stage for implementing the Varkiza Agreement, because after understanding the domestic and foreign crises, the people are tired of internal strife and are willing to reach a reconciliation. If British politicians can support it, it will certainly help the establishment of reconciliation. The first task of the united government after taking office would be to issue an amnesty, disarm civilians on both sides, and purge corrupt elements in the political, military, police, and gendarmerie, and then prepare voter registration and hold new elections. Only free elections can create domestic and international trust in the Greek government. According to what Mr. Su mentioned, the Varkiza Agreement was signed in February 1945, originally to end the internal strife that began in December 1944.

[United Press Washington, 15th] It was revealed here today that the Bulgarian government representative has issued a statement denying the Greek claim that Bulgarian mechanized units and aircraft are concentrated near the border between Greece, Bulgaria, and Turkey, saying that this news is "ridiculous."

### Sudden New Change in British Labour Party MPs' "Rebellion" Case: Foreign Policy Amendment Allowed for Debate in the House of Commons: US Believes it is Identical to the Wallace Incident

[Reuters London, 15th] There was a sudden new change in the Labour Party MPs' "rebellion" case this morning. Speaker of the House Brown announced that he was prepared to submit the foreign policy amendment and conscription amendment proposed by them for discussion. Last night, the general feeling was that the foreign policy amendment would not be submitted for discussion, so the "rebellion" movement would soon succumb. Unexpectedly, the Speaker's announcement this morning changed the situation. Our newspaper's political correspondent said that the intention of this new development was to place the more than 70 "rebel" Labour MPs in a difficult position. Speaker Brown said that the debate on the King's speech in Parliament will continue on Monday in order to discuss the amendments proposed by Crossman and others. If necessary, he is prepared to formally allow debate on this amendment. (The Speaker has the power to decide which amendment can be submitted for debate and vote) Observers believe that the Speaker's announcement is intended to place the responsibility for continuing the "rebellion" firmly on the shoulders of the "rebel" MPs. They must decide before Monday whether to face the attacks from the government and other Labour MPs in Parliament.

[Reuters London, 14th] The number of signatories to the "rebel" Labour MPs' foreign policy amendment increased by 13 today, bringing the total to 57, which will not be difficult to exceed 60. However, since Prime Minister Attlee made a strong speech yesterday, some of the original signatories have wavered in their determination and expressed surprise at Prime Minister Attlee's firm attitude, so they may not continue to pursue the matter. Lord President of the Council Morrison also issued a warning to these "rebel" Labour MPs, telling them that if such "rebellious" actions continue to be launched, the Labour Party rules, which were suspended at the beginning of this year, may be restored. It is generally believed that the leaders who launched this "rebellion" may be subject to disciplinary action in accordance with party rules.

### US Attaches Great Importance

[Reuters Washington, 14th] Here, great attention is being paid to the "rebellion" of British Labour MPs, which is seen as an "anti-American and pro-Soviet" action. Some people compare this incident to the dispute between Wallace and Byrnes in the United States. American newspapers commented that the number of "rebels" is not large enough to change the government's foreign policy, but Moscow cannot help but doubt the consistency of the Anglo-American stance. Reports from London say that if the British government is forced to change its foreign policy, Chancellor of the Exchequer Dalton will succeed as Foreign Secretary. The first task after taking office will be to fly to Moscow to seek the basis for Anglo-Soviet cooperation. Howard newspaper reporter Denny said that the "rebel" Labour MPs believe that the capitalist and imperialist United States has bewitched Attlee and Bevin, making them willing to work for gold-based diplomacy.

### South Africa Annexes Southwest Africa: US Expresses Opposition

[Reuters Lake Success, New York, 14th] At a meeting of the United Nations Trusteeship Council today, representatives from India, Mexico, Syria, Bolivia and other countries firmly opposed South Africa's request to merge Southwest Africa. The US delegation also distributed a formal statement at the beginning of the meeting, stating that the United States was willing to express its support for the opinions of some other delegations, believing that the documents submitted to the United Nations General Assembly by the South African delegation were insufficient to enable the Assembly to approve the incorporation of the Southwest African trusteeship territory into the Union of South Africa.

### The Soviet Union Abuses Veto Power, Small Country Representatives Criticize Strongly, Australia Proposes Three Remedial Measures

[United Press International, Lake Success, New York, 14th] The United Nations Political Committee held a meeting today lasting three hours. Representatives from seven small countries, including Cuba, Argentina, the Philippines, and New Zealand, voiced opposition to the veto power, calling it an expression of "great power dictatorship." Only Poland defended the veto power.

[Reuters, Lake Success, New York, 14th] Australian representative Hasluck, in his speech to the Political Committee today, first accused the Soviet Union of abusing the veto power. When he introduced a resolution on the veto power, he stated that the questions raised by the Australian delegation to the Committee were not to revise the veto power provision of Article 27, but whether the great powers had fulfilled their accepted obligations when adopting that article. Hasluck then reviewed the work of the Security Council, pointing out that the Soviet Union had used the veto power as many as ten times. The most obvious and egregious thing was that a permanent member could arbitrarily choose a resolution to use its veto power on. In other words, the privileges stipulated in Article 27 have been pushed to a dangerous point, allowing a member of the Security Council to not only interfere with the actions of the Council but also to interfere with what the Council intends to do. Hasluck's accusations can be summarized into three points: (1) The spirit of the Charter has not been followed; the use of the veto power exceeds the original intention of the San Francisco Conference and violates the guarantees made by the great powers at the San Francisco Conference. (2) The manner in which the veto power is used manipulates the work of the Security Council, undermines public trust in the Council, and reduces the effectiveness of the Security Council. (3) Permanent members use the veto power as part of their national policy, forgetting their responsibilities to the Charter and no longer speaking on behalf of other members. Therefore, the Australian delegation proposes the following measures for remedy: (1) Permanent members of the Security Council should limit the use of the veto power. (2) Increase the exchange of views among the five powers. (3) Improve the Security Council system so that procedural issues do not require constant voting.

### British Troops to Withdraw from Egypt, Completion Expected Within Five Months, Merger with Sudan Approved by British Government

Egypt also proposed that, to ensure the welfare of the Sudanese people, their interests should be treated with utmost consideration, and an autonomous government should be established. Therefore, the Egyptian government hopes that the British and Egyptian governments can succeed and that the two countries can conclude an alliance to ensure true friendship between the two countries, which will take into account and protect the interests of both parties.

### United States Considers Severing Relations with Romania, Romanian Government Infringes on Freedom of Opposition Parties

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 14th] A responsible person told this agency's reporter that US Secretary of State Byrnes is working closely with the State Department and Undersecretary of State Acheson to study the possibility of the US severing diplomatic relations with the Romanian government. The US government has protested to the Romanian government three times regarding its infringement on the freedom of opposition parties and freedom of the press, but all have been rejected. The State Department is now studying the possibility of recalling its political representative in Romania, Berry.

[Reuters, Washington, 15th] Romanian opposition parties have submitted a note to the foreign ministers of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, protesting the Romanian government's actions before the election and requesting international intervention in the Romanian general election on November 19. A US State Department spokesman said today that the note points out that the government's tactics have undermined the validity of the election and requests that the electoral register be revised under international supervision. The note was signed by the Romanian National Peasants' Party, National Liberal Party, and Independent Socialist Party, demanding the restoration of the freedom and rights of the opposition parties, guaranteeing the personal freedom of voters and candidates, and that the military police and authorities should take a fair stance.

### Eden Advocates for British-Soviet Friendship

[Agence France-Presse, London, 14th] The British House of Commons met today to continue debating the King's speech. Former Foreign Secretary Eden delivered a speech stating that if Britain and the Soviet Union can maintain a permanent friendly relationship, it will greatly benefit European peace. As for the German question, the current situation in the British occupied zone of Germany has caused extreme concern in our country. Our government must proceed steadily, face reality, and this is the time. However, if other countries are not prepared to fulfill the obligations stipulated in their international agreements, then we cannot fulfill them either. I now know that the Potsdam Agreement has become an excuse for various failures, but in fact, these failures are caused by other reasons. As for the relationship between our country and the countries of Western Europe, I also advocate that we should maintain close economic and cultural relations with France and other countries in Western Europe. Eden went on to express support for the government's protests to Poland and Romania, believing that the failure of the governments of those two countries to protect free elections was a major blow to democracy.

### British Prime Minister Attlee Urges Search for New Goods Markets

[United Press International, London, 14th] Prime Minister Attlee declared today that Britain must seek new markets for new goods to maintain its world trade position. We must continue to look to the future with a broad vision, adapt to future needs, and not cling to the past, content to maintain old markets for old goods. Our England, as an industrial country, is moving from simple production to more perfect and complex manufactured goods, and should use its skills, intelligence, and initiative to maintain our position in world trade.

### Jewish Liberation Movement Faction Organizes Provisional Government Overseas

[Reuters, Paris, 14th] The Secretary-General of the Jewish National Liberation Movement, who claims to be the political spokesman for the Irgun party, Maorlin, told the Paris Evening News that the Jewish National Liberation Government has begun to organize a provisional Palestinian government overseas. Some countries inside and outside the "Iron Curtain" in Europe, as well as some countries in North and South America, have informed us that they are willing to establish practical relations with the provisional government. Maorlin denied reports that Jewish people were planning to bomb the British Embassy in Paris and assassinate British Chief of the General Staff Field Marshal Montgomery.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 14th] The News Chronicle recently conducted a public opinion poll on whether the Palestine issue should be handed over to the United Nations for resolution. The results showed that 57% supported handing the issue over to the UN, 22% supported the Jewish people solving their own problems, and the remaining 21% expressed no opinion.

Egyptians are reportedly surprised by these activities, believing that this shows that British troops do not intend to withdraw from Egypt, but merely retreat to the canal zone.

### Rumor of Agreement Between China and East Indies

Dutch to Reorganize Territories

[Agence France-Presse, Batavia, 15th] According to sources in the East Indies, China seems to be asking the Republic of Indonesia to sign an agreement to protect the interests of the overseas Chinese in Java and Sumatra.

[United Press International, The Hague, 14th] The Dutch government announced today that it would completely reorganize the Dutch territories, placing the East Indies and the Netherlands on an equal footing, nominally under Dutch rule, and jointly handling foreign affairs and national defense, and, when necessary, also handling finance, economy, and culture. According to Dutch Prime Minister Peel's announcement in parliament, the Dutch Commissioner in the East Indies proposed changing the "Kingdom of the Netherlands" to the "United Nations of the Netherlands East Indies," with Queen Wilhelmina as the head of the United Nations, formed by two countries, namely the "Federation of the East Indies" and the "Kingdom of the Netherlands." The Federation of the East Indies consists of the Republic of Indonesia, Java, Sumatra, East Indonesia, and Borneo; the Kingdom of the Netherlands consists of the Netherlands proper and Surinam and Curaçao in the West Indies. This draft agreement to resolve the East Indies revolution is expected to be signed in Batavia on the 15th. Peel also announced that the Kingdom of the Netherlands will not be split, but will only adapt to the needs of the times and change its form and name. According to a senior official in Java, the Federation of the East Indies will include the former Dutch East Indies archipelago, except for regions that request separation. The federal government will respect the basic rights of life and property of the Dutch in the East Indies.

### Roosevelt's Telegram to Japanese Emperor Was Held Back by Staff, Witness Testifies

[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 15th] The Far East International Military Tribunal continued to hear testimony today from Shiroo Chishiro, a staff member of the Foreign Affairs Section of the Japanese Ministry of Communications, explaining the reason for the delay in delivering Roosevelt's telegram to US Ambassador Grew to Japan. Shiroo testified that on November 29, 1941, when he was a supervisor in the Telegraph Inspection Office of the Ministry of Communications, Lieutenant Colonel Tomura Morio of the Communications Section of the General Staff Headquarters came to inform him that all diplomatic telegrams must be delayed by five hours before being sent out. This order applied to all telegrams except those from the Japanese government and those related to Germany and Italy. Shiroo learned of the contents of President Roosevelt's telegram to the Japanese Emperor between 4 and 6 pm on December 7. At this time, Tomura called again to inform him that telegrams must now be delayed by fifteen hours. He did not remember who handled the president's telegram that day. At 4 am on December 18, the head of the Overseas Telegraph Section of the Telegraph Bureau of the Ministry of Communications informed Shiroo by telephone that, upon the order of the Army, all overseas communications must be stopped. Defense attorneys Kiyose and Brooks questioned Shiroo, wanting to prove that the purpose of the General Staff Headquarters' order to delay telegrams was purely to strengthen inspections, and not solely for Roosevelt's telegram, but they did not achieve their goal.

Hull Lambasted the Japanese Government

Prosecutors then produced various documents, including documents from US diplomatic relations stating that Japanese Ambassador to the US Nomura and Kurusu first requested to meet with US Secretary of State Hull at 1 pm on December 7, and then requested a delay of 45 minutes. As a result, Hull received the two at 2:28 pm, and Nomura handed the official document to Hull, saying that he was ordered to hand it over at 1 pm, but it was delayed due to translating the telegram. Hull then asked: Is this being submitted upon the order of the Japanese government? Nomura replied yes. Hull then said: In the past nine months, I have spoken to you without a single falsehood. In my fifty years of public service, I never imagined that any government on Earth could speak such words, and I have never seen a document so full of shameful falsehoods and distortions. Nomura and Kurusu remained silent and quietly withdrew. It is reported that the Japanese military launched a sneak attack on Pearl Harbor at 1:28 pm Washington time.

### Atomic Disease Not Yet Eradicated, Japanese Ophthalmologist Publishes Clinical Paper

[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 15th] Koyanaire Hyakufu, an ophthalmologist at Nagasaki Medical University Hospital in Japan, presented a paper on corneal or retinal burns caused by the atomic bomb at an ophthalmology conference today. It is said that more than ten patients with burns to the eyeball have been found, all of whom are unmarried women. Because the light was so strong, the retina of the eye was irritated. Mild cases can be completely cured, but severe cases are very difficult. From this, it can be seen that the symptoms of atomic disease have not been completely eliminated. Currently, there are still 280 atomic disease patients in the hospital, 130 of whom still have black spots on their eyeballs or skin of their hands and feet. Most of the others have hair loss, a unique symptom of atomic disease, but they are gradually recovering. Surprisingly, there are five people in a cement house only 0.5 meters from the blast center who were completely unharmed. The results of this comprehensive study will be published abroad in detail soon.

### Goering's Will Circulates Again

Original Hidden in Allied Control Council

[Reuters, Frankfurt, 13th] A copied "Goering's Will" was recently discovered in Nuremberg. Many Germans believe that this is one of the three letters left by Goering before his suicide. Its content is undoubtedly a forgery, as the original letter is now in the archives of the Allied Control Council in Berlin, marked with the words "Absolutely Confidential, Copy Burned," which no outsider could possibly know. Nuremberg residents received the contents of Goering's "Will" printed on the wrapping paper when they received their meat rations in the morning. The will was addressed to the German people, stating: Although the Allies are smart, I am smarter. Although the Allies have won the war, it is up to you whether they can win the peace. During the Nuremberg trials, I discovered that the Germans had engaged in the most horrific acts, many of which were acts that a self-respecting German would not dare to do. The victors have sufficient evidence, even to convince me, but many other acts were necessary, such as the bombing of Warsaw, Rotterdam, and Coventry. To fight for the survival of my nation, these orders had to be issued. The Führer is dead. I can assure you that the Führer and I left you because we were confident that you did not need us and could stand up in hardship. You have learned a lot in the past thirteen years. Everything else can be forgotten, but one thing must always be remembered: that the Germans will one day be able to show the world their mission.

### Nobel Prize Winners Announced

### American Archaeologists Uncover Mythology of Japanese Founding

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 14th] Many American archaeologists recently excavated ruins on a small island near the Matsushima Peninsula, discovering a large number of skeletons and pottery, which appear to be relics of the Ainu people. It is said that the Ainu of Hokkaido are the original people of the Japanese archipelago, but their history cannot be traced because Japanese history begins in the sixth century AD. Before this, the remains had disappeared. Therefore, the Japanese spoke nonsense, claiming that the founding ancestor Emperor Jimmu was the grandson of the Sun Goddess, thinking that there would be no evidence of death. Now that historical traces have been discovered, scholars can expose Japanese mythology and establish a reliable history for Japan.

### Koo Vi-kyuin's Speech Praises Nehru

[United Press, New York, 14th] Chinese Ambassador to the United States Dr. Koo Vi-kyuin was the main speaker at the Nehru birthday banquet tonight, and he praised the leader of the Indian National Government. Dr. Koo said: "I believe that what is particularly praiseworthy about Mr. Nehru is his selflessness and his heartfelt service to the country. His moral courage is exemplary. In order to achieve India's freedom, he never considered his personal freedom. We can even say that this birthday is a rebirth for him and his great country, because today Mr. Nehru has become the de facto administrative head of India."

### US Military Blood Plasma Flows into Black Market, Astonishing Quantity Worth Considerable Price, Red Cross Protests, Foreign Liquidation Committee is Recovering, US State Department Attaches Importance and Orders Thorough Investigation

[United Press, This City Report] Tens of thousands of units of blood plasma donated by the American people to the US military during the war have been transferred to the Shanghai black market and sold for US$25 per pint. According to the Shanghai branch of the Foreign Liquidation Committee, the inflow of this blood plasma into the Shanghai market was due to "lack of supervision." It is said that this blood plasma, along with a large number of medical supplies, was announced by the US Navy on Okinawa Island as "surplus materials." After being transferred to the Shanghai branch of the Foreign Liquidation Committee, the contents were not carefully inspected, so it was sold together with other medical supplies. The American Red Cross believes that the blood plasma is the property of the Association and, according to military rules, all donated blood plasma and other medical supplies from the Red Cross that have been used by the military must be returned to the Red Cross for free distribution to hospitals or other organizations. Therefore, the Red Cross protested to the Foreign Liquidation Committee, which has agreed to find a way to recover it. According to well-informed sources, the Foreign Liquidation Committee sold this blood plasma for an average price of about US$0.50 to US$0.75 per unit. The sale of blood plasma was discovered because advertisements were published in Chinese newspapers. It is reported that this blood plasma has been scattered in various warehouses and pharmacies in the city. The Foreign Liquidation Committee has contacted Chinese merchants to find ways to repurchase the blood plasma. It is estimated that the total amount of blood plasma flowing into the Shanghai market is about 290 kiloliters, worth about US$10 million.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 15th] An official announced that the State Department immediately ordered the representative of the Foreign Liquidation Committee in Shanghai to investigate the matter upon receiving the Shanghai report from the United Press stating that US blood plasma was being sold in the Shanghai black market.

### Telegrams to Europe, Prices Reduced Starting Today, Press Telegrams Still Calculated at Original Price

In order to reduce the burden on telegraphers, the Ministry of Communications had previously renegotiated with the US side to reduce the price of the basic gold franc for international telegrams.

### Mrs. Cripps Hosts Reporters at the Mayor's Residence to Discuss Aid to China; Visits Army Hospital This Afternoon; Broadcasts Domestically and Internationally This Evening

[Our Report] Mrs. Cripps, President of the British United Aid to China Fund, arrived in Shanghai from Peiping the day before yesterday. At 10 a.m. yesterday, accompanied by Mrs. Miller, the Fund's Secretary-General, she held a press conference at Mayor Wu's residence to report on the establishment and work of the Fund. It was stated that after the outbreak of World War II, Sir Stafford Cripps visited India, China, the Soviet Union, and the United States before returning to England. His diaries written in China aroused Mrs. Cripps' great interest in the Chinese people. At the same time, Mrs. Cripps learned about the suffering of the Chinese people from Bishop Hall of Hong Kong, which further increased her sympathy for China, leading her to establish the British United Aid to China Fund in 1942. At that time, Mrs. Cripps broadcast to the British people to raise funds for aid to China, with a target of 500,000 pounds. However, the result was only 360,000 pounds, but this achievement exceeded any previous fundraising effort. Donations came from people of all parties and from all parts of Britain, accumulating from small contributions. The Fund's fundraising for aid to China has so far reached 1.8 million pounds. More than 700 units have been distributed to various Chinese organizations, including the China Welfare Fund Committee, run by Madame Sun Yat-sen, Soong Ching-ling, which receives a monthly donation of 11 million Chinese yuan. Other recipients include the Yan'an International Peace Hospital, Shenyang Christian Hospital, and various medical institutions and children's nurseries. Currently, British aid to China is decreasing due to the severity of domestic relief efforts in Britain. However, the Fund's work to help China will continue, and will proceed after discussions with the Chinese authorities.

Mrs. Cripps expressed great satisfaction with her inspection of relief efforts in various places. At 4 p.m. yesterday, she attended a joint reception by the British Social Association and various charitable and relief organizations in the city and gave a speech. This morning, she will visit the Army Hospital of the Jiangwan Military Medical Administration and attend a luncheon at the Administration.

### Conclusion of the GuangZhao Association Lawsuit

The lawsuit against Liang Yuming, Chairman of the Reorganization Committee of the GuangZhao Association of this city, for alleged fraud, breach of trust, and conspiracy to elect the chairman, has been ongoing for a long time. It is now learned that the two cases have been judged separately by the court, and the circumstances are as follows: After the GuangZhao Association submitted a report to the Social Bureau to appoint a reorganization committee, the committee, through corrupt election, elected Liang Yuming as the chairman. However, Feng Shaoshan, the former custodian of the association, was late in handing over the assets. Furthermore, Liu Tiemei and Zhang Wenjun, staff members of the association who were responsible for disaster relief, sued Liang Yuming in the Shanghai District Court for fraudulently obtaining more than 5 million yuan. After investigation by prosecutor Zhang Yuanzhen, it was determined that Liang Yuming had not committed fraud or breach of trust, and on October 23, a decision was made not to prosecute. At the same time, Lu Xingyuan filed a complaint in the civil court, accusing Liang Yuming of violating the charter and conspiring to elect the chairman, requesting confirmation that the election was invalid and ordering him to bear the litigation costs. After questioning by the civil court, it was determined that the allegations were not factual, and a judgment was also issued yesterday, dismissing the lawsuit and ordering the plaintiff to bear the litigation costs.

### Identification of Japanese Criminals by Martyred Comrades; Public Trial Possible Within Next Week; Part of the Interrogation Completed

The Shanghai Martyred Comrades Association has twice gone to the concentration camp of the War Criminals Management Office of the Ministry of National Defense to identify war criminals. More than 60 people arrived in the afternoon. After the case was transferred to the military court of the First Pacification Zone Headquarters for interrogation, prosecutor Lin Woming has completed the interrogation of the first war criminal identified at the scene of the martyrdom, and has formally filed a public prosecution, which will be publicly tried within the next week.

Later, he was sentenced by the Japanese military court. After the victory, he was released and went to identify the suspects after their arrest. The victim, Yu Peng, testified in court about the crimes of Kanohara and others, and the confrontation was accurate. Kanohara and others' implementation of violence against the arrested suspects was a clear violation of international war conventions and should be prosecuted for corruption.

### Fourth Meeting of the Central District Traffic; Approval to Allow Tricycles on the Waibaidu Bridge Sidewalk; Revision of the Traffic Regulations on Henan Road to Extend from Beijing Road to the Eastern Section of Zhongzheng Road

### Fight Over Dancers: Brandishing Guns as a Show of Force; Young Master of Tongchang Car Company Detained for Three Days as a Warning

[Our Report] Zhu Dechun, 24, the young master of the Tongchang Car Company on Yunnan Road, residing at No. 3, Lane 176, Jiangyin Street, and his friend Xue Zhiyi and others, had a conflict with Mao Zongshu, the young master of the Tingdali Dance Hall, over dancers sitting at their tables at the New Xianlin Dance Hall at 12 p.m. on the 24th of last month. They then started fighting. In a moment of desperation, Zhu brandished his self-defense pistol as a show of force. Officers from the Shanghai North District Inspection Office of the Garrison Command happened to pass by, and seeing the commotion inside the dance hall, and fearing trouble, they stepped forward and took the pistol from Zhu. Upon inspection, the bullets were found to be loaded. At that time, police officers from the Beijing West Road Police Station of the Jing'an Temple Sub-bureau also arrived after hearing the news, and took both parties to the sub-bureau for questioning.

### Opening of the Fundraising Campaign of the Chinese Leprosy Relief Association; Copper Pig Auctioned on the Spot; Fundraising Target of 200 Million Yuan Expected to Be Reached

[Our Report] The Chinese Leprosy Relief Association held the opening ceremony of its 7th fundraising campaign at Kang Le Restaurant at 4 p.m. yesterday. Those present included the honorary general captain of the association, Mayor Wu Guozhen, honorary deputy captain Director Zhang Wei, and guests Quan Shaowen, Xu Zhendong, Gu Chunfan, Xu Yongzuo, and more than 100 others. First, Yan Fuling delivered the opening speech on behalf of Chairman Diao Xinde (who was late due to illness), stating that there are approximately one million leprosy patients in the country. The Da Chang Leprosy Sanatorium in this city has not been repaired due to the need for repair funds of approximately 200 million yuan; it currently only accommodates 58 patients and urgently needs to raise enough funds to accommodate 150 patients. In addition, equipment fees of approximately 50 million yuan, subsidies for leprosy sanatoriums across the country of 20 million yuan, and operating expenses for the association next year of approximately 30 million yuan, totaling approximately 300 million yuan, are needed. The International Leprosy Relief Association has promised to donate US$20,000, and the Executive Yuan will donate some equipment. He urged all sectors to actively support the campaign. Then, Mayor Wu delivered a speech, stating that leprosy patients often suffer from numbness, and recovery takes time. They deserve everyone's sympathy and relief. Isolation and treatment can reduce the spread of the disease. Zhang Wei then delivered a speech, describing the history of leprosy, modern treatment techniques, and the Chinese Leprosy Relief Association's enthusiasm for struggle and service. Secretary-General Guo Zhijian reported on the association's affairs and the organization of the fundraising team. Then, Qi Zhi, the general captain of the fundraising team, Wang Jitao, the deputy general captain, and foreign guest Mr. Lee successively delivered speeches. Finally, guest Mr. Wang auctioned off copper charity pigs, which were divided into large, medium, and small sizes. The large size was priced at 500,000 yuan each, and one was purchased by each of Lu Meiseng, Qi Zhi, Wang Jitao, and Qi Yunqing. The medium size was priced at 250,000 yuan, and one was purchased by each of Xu Zhendong and Zhang Xiling. The small size was priced at 100,000 yuan, and one was purchased by He Xingyuan.

The origin of the charity pig is as follows: In the past, there was a person named Mr. Card, who was dedicated to relieving leprosy patients. He wanted to relieve ten leprosy patients, but only had US$205, which was not enough for one person. His son, although young, was full of sympathy and did not sleep all night. The next morning, he suggested to his father that he buy a small pig to raise, and wait for it to grow up, and then use the proceeds to make up the difference. The children in the neighborhood knew that this pig was being raised to relieve leprosy, and all donated good feed. In a few months, it was exceptionally fat and strong, and was sold for US$25, which was donated to leprosy relief. This is the short history of the charity pig.

The atmosphere at the meeting yesterday was enthusiastic. It is predicted that the fundraising result will exceed the original target.

### American Booksellers Discuss Reprinting Books: Violates the Provisions of the Sino-American Treaty of Commerce

[Our Report] After the signing of the Sino-American Treaty of Commerce, Article 9, which stipulates that both contracting parties should have all rights and advantages of any nature with respect to copyright and literary and artistic works, has aroused concern and anxiety in the publishing industry in China. It is generally believed that due to the signing of this treaty, the unauthorized reprinting and sale of Western books will be prohibited in the future. From a legal and objective standpoint, "copyright" should be respected. However, in the future, college and university students will lose the convenience of enjoying cheap reprints of balanced production books. As for translation rights, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently stated that the treaty also had a protocol stipulating that if Chinese laws and regulations do not provide protection against translation for Chinese people, then the same protection does not need to be provided to Americans. The "Copyright Law" of our country does not prohibit translation, so the treaty does not have much impact on the general book industry and publishing industry.

The reporter also interviewed Pang Tiemo, the manager of Sino-American Bookstore. He was extremely indignant about the unauthorized reprinting of Western books by the Chinese publishing industry, believing that this was no different from theft, and pointed to the reprint advertisement for anatomy books published by a certain bookstore in the newspaper, telling the reporter: although the treaty has been stipulated, reprinting continues as before! He has reported this situation to American publishing houses and will take appropriate steps after the treaty is effectively implemented.

### Eight Years of Arduous Struggle: Military Medicine Advances, Jiangwan Builds National Defense Medical Center, New Equipment, Excellent Environment, May Become a National Demonstration Zone

The War of Resistance against Japan gave our country's military medical work a severe test, but it also opened up a path towards modernization. A senior military officer objectively reviewed the contributions of military medicine during the eight years of arduous struggle to reporters, frankly admitting two regrets: First, the enemy's firepower was too strong, making our country's rescue work difficult. Seriously wounded soldiers at the front lines sometimes could not be saved. Second, the training of rescue personnel was insufficient. Some had too little knowledge and lacked a strong sense of responsibility, so it was sometimes impossible to achieve their mission while taking risks. However, even with the above shortcomings, no large-scale infectious diseases occurred in the military during the eight years of the War of Resistance. In the spring of 1942, when retreating from northern Guizhou, an acute outbreak of bubonic plague suddenly occurred among the retreating people, with more than two thousand deaths every day. If this disease had spread in the troops, it would have undermined the combat effectiveness of the national army, but thanks to the implementation of effective epidemic prevention work, the army escaped this major disaster. Therefore, he said: In fairness, military medical work had its contributions during the war. Of course, there were weaknesses, and these weaknesses need to be addressed and improved so that the military medical work of the national army can embark on the road to modernization.

Insufficient Manpower and Resources

In the autumn of the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), our country's military medical work was insufficient to cope with a long-term international war. The objective conditions were too inadequate. In terms of manpower, the entire national army was estimated to need 30,000 doctors. But there were only 10,000 doctors in the whole country! We could not effectively conscript doctors. When the war shifted to the rear, even fewer doctors moved inland with the government. The lack of military doctors directly affected the health care and life-saving efforts of the soldiers. At the same time, 40% of the diagnosis and treatment of patients relied on doctors, and 60% relied on nurses, but there was a severe shortage of trained nurses in the national army. In terms of material resources, a good hospital must have three conditions: buildings, nurses, and beds. In wartime China, these were out of the question, and the suffering of the soldiers was exacerbated. Especially during major battles, there were too many casualties, which made the limited field hospitals overwhelmed. During the Battle of Shanghai, three thousand people could be sent to the hospital in one day. On the Shanghai-Jiading line, sometimes only one company returned from a division! This tragic sacrifice also meant that limited facilities could not take care of the wounded warriors at the same time. Originally, this situation also existed in foreign countries. For example, during the Dunkirk evacuation, British wounded soldiers did not receive treatment for a week. In the retreat from India to Guizhou, wounded soldiers were forgotten. However, these were ultimately regrets.

Different Factions of Medical Officers

In addition to the lack of manpower and resources, differences in the training and level of medical officers also caused many unnecessary difficulties. At the beginning of the War of Resistance, the troops were not modern enough, and medical officers had not undergone unified training. Their educational levels were different, and their medical achievements were also very different. This naturally produced factionalism, reduced work efficiency, and complicated the difficulty of medical supply. Those who learned American medicine wanted to use American drugs; those who specialized in German medicine would only use German drugs; some were perhaps Chinese medicine practitioners, and they neither believed in nor understood Western medicine. But the army is not a department store; it cannot have everything. Therefore, our troops were particularly short of medicines. At the same time, it is undeniable that there were many shortcomings in our country's wartime conscription. Before enlisting, the physical condition and age of soldiers were not strictly checked. After entering the camp, new recruits were often found to have diseases that should not be in the military, and the military did not have preparations for these drugs. Naturally, there was a shortage of drugs, which was also a fact. Before Guangzhou was lost in the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), we bought a large batch of medicines in Hong Kong, which even caused the Hong Kong government to find it strange. But in retrospect, it was fortunate that this transaction took place, otherwise, there would have been an even greater shortage of medicines.

Serving Without Avoiding Hardship

It is conceivable that it was difficult to cope with an unprecedented war with insufficient preparation. In order to solve the shortage of manpower, the Military Medical Department set up short-term training classes to train 10,000 medical officers and assigned them to serve in various armies. Although these hastily trained medical officers felt that their knowledge and experience were insufficient, they did not avoid difficulties, and their enthusiasm for service was very high. In wartime military medical work, in addition to insufficient material resources, we also suffered greatly from inconvenient transportation. For example, in the U.S. military, their medical equipment could be very complex and thoughtful, while we could only strive for simplicity and ease of transport. The reason is that we have too few means of transportation, and too many things will damage mobility. The lack of these material conditions could only be compensated for by the enthusiasm of the staff.

Medicines Rely Entirely on the United States

External assistance mainly relied on the United States. Today, a fair criticism is that the United States has indeed made its best efforts, but the actual benefits our country has received are limited. The objective reasons are as follows: First, the "Europe First" principle guided the entire strategy and supply. Not only did more than 90% of the materials under the Lend-Lease Act go to Britain and the Soviet Union, but even in terms of medicines, more than half went to the European battlefield. The second reason is that the island-hopping war in the Pacific was the main battlefield in the Far East in the eyes of the Allies, and a lot of medical aid went there. Third, at that time, China's supply route was only the airlift over the "Hump," which had to fly over the highest mountains in the world and was at risk of interception by Zero fighters. Many American pilots sacrificed in this area. Medicines were continuously transported from this airlift line to Kunming, but it was only a small part of the limited supply. Finally, the Chinese battlefield area was too wide, and the number of national troops was very large. Once the limited medicines were distributed to various war zones, the quantity was very small. However, even if foreign aid was not as large as our country expected, when we think about the fact that the United States was supplying the whole world, we should still deeply thank our friends who did not avoid danger and provided timely help.

Three Tasks After the War

After the victory, military medical work ended the dark years of wartime support and moved towards a bright, modern path. All current plans and efforts are in line with the overall plan for military building. The current specific tasks are: First, to select soldiers for the new army, to standardize the physical fitness of the army, and to distinguish its "types," using scientific methods to determine the soldier's performance and the tasks he is best suited to undertake. In the United States, this system has been implemented for a long time. New soldiers are classified and categorized like commodities, and people and things are closely matched. Our country is just beginning to take this path. The second is the health care work in the military, which will be strictly implemented in the military in the future. It is not difficult for us to obtain new weapons, but we need soldiers who are physically and mentally sound to use these weapons. The third task is the self-strengthening of the military medical institutions themselves. All medical and health tools will be adjusted and modernized. The standards for medical supply require a large number of training for military doctors to adapt to the needs of the new army; the training and development of nurses will also not be neglected. In the future, a large number of experts will be used in the health work of the troops, not only focusing on physical fitness, but also on psychology. With these facilities, a new modern national defense army can be established.

Jiangwan Medical Center

The effort to modernize the health work of the troops is manifested in the establishment of the National Defense Medical Center in Jiangwan in the Shanghai area. At the core of this medical center is the Shanghai Army Hospital, and the periphery includes nursing schools, military medical schools, hygiene laboratories, and hygiene service training centers. The Shanghai Army Hospital was the enemy's No. 157 military hospital during the enemy's occupation period, and the current reorganization work has not yet been completed, and the traces of the Japanese living there are obvious. I asked a responsible military officer for his comments on the Japanese military hospital. His reply was that the Japanese rear station hospital was not clean and the equipment inside was too old. But it had everything it should have. As for the Japanese military medical system, it was quite good. There are a total of twelve army hospitals in our country, including those in Taiwan. Now new medical equipment is coming in continuously. Due to the superior objective conditions, the medical center in the Jiangwan area may be a demonstration area.

American Donation Fund

The military medical laboratory in the Hygiene Laboratory is still a Sino-American cooperative undertaking. This institution is administratively under the Military Medical Department, but it is economically and strongly assisted by the American Bureau for Medical Aid to China. It has allocated 250,000 US dollars in one lump sum to donate to the laboratory as a foundation, with 150,000 US dollars to purchase equipment and 100,000 US dollars for other purposes. They also occupy an important position in technical guidance. I visited their blood plasma intravenous fluid department, animal laboratory, disinfection distillation department, etc., and saw a lot of new equipment and storage. I deeply felt that in an environment where friends are willing to help, the most important thing is to work hard ourselves and not to live up to the good opportunity!

### Shen Siliang's Preliminary Hearing Yesterday; Claimed Submission to the Puppet Regime Was to Cope with the Environment and Protect School Property; The High Prosecutor's Office Indicted and Requested Lenient Treatment; Chen Lifu and Yan Huiqing Provided Letters to Testify

[This newspaper reported] Shen Siliang, the former president of St. John's University, was arrested by the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters on June 25 this year under a secret order from the National Government and transferred to the Procuratorate of the High Court of this city. After four months of investigation, he was finally prosecuted on suspicion of being a traitor. The indictment listed the facts of the crime, but stated that his submission to the enemy and participation in the puppet regime was aimed at adapting to the environment, maintaining the school, and preventing students from being left without education, which was different from ordinary traitors who colluded with the enemy. It was requested that the High Court grant lenient treatment. The case was initially heard in the High Court yesterday afternoon, and the interrogation lasted more than an hour. The court ordered that the case still needed further investigation and adjourned for another hearing. The defendant was still detained.

Shen wore a gray suit and black leather shoes, his hair was already streaked with white, and his expression was haggard. He said in a low voice: I am 51 years old, from Ningbo. I live at St. John's University and have worked at the school for 30 years. I have been the president of the school since January 1940. In 1938, I went to Chongqing to ask the then Minister of Education, Chen Lifu, for instructions, who instructed me to return to Shanghai to continue maintaining the school. Among the puppet positions mentioned in the indictment, such as member of the puppet Greater East Asia Anti-British and Anti-American Association, member of the puppet New National Movement Promotion Association, and member of the Education Committee of the puppet Shanghai Special Municipality Citizens' Welfare Association, I did not participate in any of them, and there was no such thing. As for what was stated in the puppet New China Handbook, my name was put in without seeking my consent in advance, and there was no way to publish a statement in the newspaper at that time. Also, as for the Standing Director of the puppet Sino-Japanese Cultural Association Shanghai Branch, my name was also put in by the then puppet mayor Chen Gongbo. The Deputy Director of the puppet Shanghai National Sports Association was written by Chu Minyi, and none of them sought my consent. As for the puppet Enemy Property Management Committee, I attended two meetings because the school property was under the military management of the Japanese at that time, and there was a seal on the gate. Attending the meeting only knew how to take over St. John's, and the chairman of the committee was Zhang Sumin. As for serving as a member of the puppet Shanghai Special Municipality Municipal Advisory Committee, I took the position since Chen Gongbo served as the puppet mayor, but I only attended the meetings and did not express any opinions or proposals. Because the committee was a representative of public opinion, there was no salary. When Zhou Fohai served as the puppet mayor, I did not participate. As for serving as the chairman of the puppet Sports Association and the chairman of the Football Federation, I was recommended because I had some history in sports in the past. But this is a public organization, and my sports purpose is only to talk about amateur technology and not politics. The football association only manages seasonal games and cup games, and nothing else. Therefore, as for the organization of football teams to raise funds to supply Ding Mocun's secret service funds, it may be that they directly contacted the various teams, which I could not control. In February 1943, I went to Beijing in the name of the president of St. John's University to attend the puppet Third National Education Administration Conference, because the Japanese coveted the school property, I was ordered by the American Bishop Lo Peide to go and perfunctorily deal with it, but I returned before the closing ceremony, and did not make any speeches or proposals. As for serving as the chief of the Ning District of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Baojia Committee, I was publicly elected by the people, but because the school was busy, I only met once a month to discuss local matters. As for attending a joint performance at the puppet Anti-British and Anti-American Association's first congress, and attending the welcome banquet for the enemy Ambassador Koki Hirota and Wang Jingwei, there was no such thing. I did not participate in the commission appointed by the Japanese-initiated puppet Dalian, Shanghai, and Nanjing Anti-Sports Committee to serve as the vice chairman. Sakamoto Yoshitaka and Tagawa Daikichi, two professors, were hired at St. John's University to teach economics and history courses, not to serve as consultants. It was not to monitor students. It was only because at that time, there was a rumor that the Japanese intended to send Japanese to various schools to take on homework, so I first asked these two to resist. These two were Christian disciples and were also dissatisfied with their domestic politics. The school's curriculum was no different from before the war, with no addition of the Japanese Constitution, Japanese Economy, or History of the Meiji Restoration. At that time, in order to avoid accidents, I did not allow any extracurricular activities except for the Christian fellowship. As the president of the school, I also have a patriotic heart. Everything is to avoid immediate losses, otherwise, the school may be closed immediately due to small problems, and it may also cause dissatisfaction among some students. Participating in the above puppet positions was also to cope with the environment in various aspects and protect the school property.

Presenting Evidence and Requesting Bail

The two defense lawyers, Hong Shihao and Mi Xitong, presented to the judge a letter from Chen Lifu regarding the defendant's return to Shanghai to continue maintaining the school, and documents from the International YMCA, the chairman of the St. John's University Board of Trustees, Yan Huiqing, and others to testify for the defendant. It proved how the defendant maintained the school at that time, mostly based on the intention of the Board of Trustees. The defendant also ran a wounded soldier hospital during the war and sent medical students to serve on the Yunnan-Burma Highway. The defense lawyers also asked the court to summon Zhang Sumin to testify at the next hearing, and to allow the defendant to be released on bail. The court ordered that the matter of bail should be submitted in writing for deliberation and decision by the collegial panel.

### Strengthening the Management of Department Stores and Shopping Malls: The Police Bureau Promulgates Six Regulations, Prohibiting the Sale of Tax-Evasive, Stolen Goods, and Ordering All Shed Shopping Malls to Close

[This newspaper reported] The authorities in this city previously ordered the banning of street vendors from September 1 to rectify the appearance of the city and facilitate traffic. Because the livelihoods of the vendors were at stake, they organized joint shopping malls, all of which were approved by the Bureau of Finance and the Bureau of Social Affairs. These joint shopping malls are neither company organizations nor partnership entities. The mall owners invest in renting houses, slightly renovate them, and then sublet the space of several square feet to vendors, charging each household a cabinet fee of 700,000 to 1 million yuan (each shopping mall accommodates about 100 vendors, and its one-time rental income is more than 100 million yuan). After investigation by the police bureau, although the establishment of these shopping malls does not hinder the appearance of the city and traffic, there are three malpractices: (1) The shopping malls are greedy for heavy profits, setting up too many cabinets, with narrow aisles, and customers are crowded and the order is chaotic. (2) The buildings and equipment are simple, and if an accident occurs, it is really unimaginable. (3) Tax-evading goods or stolen goods are inevitably sold here.

In order to prevent the above malpractices, the police bureau has formulated the following management measures: (1) Notify the Bureau of Social Affairs and the Bureau of Finance that all applications for the establishment of such vendor shopping malls should first be investigated and approved by the police bureau before they are allowed to operate. (2) Stipulate that the cabinet stalls and aisles of each shopping mall should not be less than five meters to avoid congestion. (3) Each shopping mall should add fire exits and install fire-fighting equipment to prevent accidents. (4) The inside of the mall must be kept clean at all times, and it must not sell police-violating, tax-evading, and stolen goods. (5) All shed shopping malls in the shed restricted construction area will be ordered to close down (such as the Nanhai Shopping Mall, the buildings are all made of wooden frames, cloth awnings, flower paper, and coarse mud), (6) Please ask the Bureau of Social Affairs to reasonably restrict the rent of the cabinet households.

The above proposal has been approved by the 55th municipal meeting yesterday and will be implemented soon.

### Landlords Are Unwilling to Pay Property Tax and Insist That Tenants Pay It; The Bureau of Finance Has Asked the Court for Interpretation

Since the Municipal Council decided that the property tax for this autumn and winter will be collected at 10% of the actual rent and borne by the landlord, first collected from the tenant, and then deducted from the rent by the tenant, and also passed the collection of the municipal construction donation, the calculation method is to deduct the property tax payable by the landlord from a lump sum, and the remaining amount is the municipal construction donation, which is borne by the residents. The Bureau of Finance has been following this procedure since this month, and the collection situation is very good. However, because the amount collected is the total amount of the property tax and the municipal construction donation, and both are paid by the tenant in advance, and the property tax in Shanghai has always been borne by the tenant, some landlords now insist on the original situation and do not pay the property tax, creating a situation where both donations must be borne by the tenant, which is unfair. The Bureau of Finance has asked the court for a legal interpretation on its behalf, and it is said that a reply will be issued soon.

### Two Merchants Involved in Corruption in Road Construction Were Sentenced; The Human Aspect Seems Unfair; The Hardware Industry Association Made Some Explanations

Eight members of the Hardware Industry Association were implicated in a corruption case in road construction and were each sentenced to three and a half years in prison. The association hosted the press yesterday afternoon to explain that the government's anti-corruption punishment regulations were promulgated in Chongqing in 1943. Shanghai merchants were not aware of this law, and it is customary in Shanghai business to take commissions and accept gifts. Government laws regard this as corruption. According to the regulations, the minimum sentence is seven years, but this time it was reduced by half. The eight members are the heads of eight hardware stores. If these people are imprisoned, they will have to stop doing business. The employees and their families in each store, usually ranging from dozens to hundreds of people, will also lose their jobs and face livelihood problems. It does not seem fair to say that this is humane.

### Letter

To the Editor, I read in your newspaper issue of October 12th, page 5, a news item with the headline "Heavy Reward for Receiving 3,000 Taels of Gold, Awarding Over 2,700 Taels in Bonuses; Enemy Property Handling Bureau Announces Account," which stated, "The enemy and puppet property handling bureau has basically completed the seizure and impoundment of traitors' properties to date. Regarding gold, the Shanghai area has received a total of 3,020 taels, 6 mace, and 7.8 fen. However, a portion of this was used by the former Military Intelligence Bureau to pay secret reporting bonuses, totaling 2,747 taels, 2 mace, 8 fen, and 4 li. The handling bureau's net receipt was 273 taels, 3 mace, and 9.4 fen," etc. Upon investigation, the former Shanghai office of the Military Intelligence Bureau handled the confiscation of properties of Chinese traitors, including movable and immovable properties, divided into (1) real estate, (2) bills, (3) stocks, (4) ornaments, (5) gold, silver, and currency, (6) furniture, (7) other items. In June, based on the lowest possible estimated value, the total amount of traitor property was calculated to be 5,229,700,000 yuan. According to the bureau's announcements of November 6th and December 10th of the 34th year of the Republic (1945), regarding methods of rewarding secret reporting of traitor property, 500 million yuan was allocated to the original informants as secret reporting bonuses. This allocated bonus at the time was converted into gold at the market price, totaling 2,905 taels of gold. This represents the total secret reporting bonus for the traitor property confiscated in the Shanghai area by the former Shanghai office of the Military Intelligence Bureau, not the so-called "Heavy Reward for Receiving 3,000 Taels of Gold, Awarding Over 2,700 Taels in Bonuses." (2) On November 6th, the article "Traitor Sheng's Child Interrogated Yesterday" stated that I (Sheng) "All of my property has been sealed by the Military Intelligence Bureau, it can be said to be completely confiscated. Some time ago, I saw in the Shanghai newspaper a list of my property, 62 gold bars have become 47 bars. I request the court to send a letter to the Military Intelligence Bureau and the Enemy Property Bureau." Upon investigation, the former Shanghai office of the Military Intelligence Bureau confiscated 61 large gold bars (approximately 10 taels each) and 10 small gold bars (1 tael each) from traitor Sheng (equivalent to 1 large bar), totaling 62 bars. These were recorded and transferred to the bureau long ago and have not been reduced. The property list of traitor Sheng can be used as evidence. Therefore, the above two news items do not match the facts. Accordingly, we request that you correct these reports. Secretariat of the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui.

### Social Services: Reader Consultation

Legal Questions

(1) Forcing the Redemption of Old Property

Question from Zhonghe Township Office, Nanhui: A owns a piece of land that was absolutely sold to B in November of the 28th year of the Republic (1939). In August of the 30th year (1941), B exchanged the land with C's land. After B's death, B's wife absolutely sold the exchanged land to D. Now, A's son (who joined the ××× army in the 30th year) wants to redeem the sold land from B's side at the original price. Please advise: (1) Since A's land has already been absolutely sold to B, can A's son redeem it based on his status as an active-duty soldier? (2) Can an active-duty soldier redeem sold land at the original price? (3) If redemption is possible, what are the procedures? (4) If D does not agree to the redemption, what can be done? (5) If both B and D do not agree to the redemption, if A's son uses force to coerce redemption or sues in court, will it be effective? (6) If B and D do not agree to the redemption, will any disputes that arise in between be an obstacle?

[Answer from Lawyer Cao Yaxia] (1) A has the right to freely dispose of his property and has already legally sold it. A's son cannot redeem the land. (2) No. (3) Impossible. (4) No remedy. (5) Ineffective. (6) No obstacle.

(2) Goodwill Issues

Question from Yingmu Weijian: I recently partnered with a friend to form a trading company engaged in import and export trade. The partnership agreement stipulates: "Goodwill will not be valued, but all transactions resulting from goodwill in the future, regardless of their nature, shall allocate 10% of the total net profit of each transaction as compensation for goodwill. Transactions unrelated to goodwill shall have no right to enjoy this compensation. The goodwill compensation is stipulated for a term of five years. If the company dissolves due to any reason within the term, the company's trademark, customer agents, and file documents shall all be unconditionally handed over to me. After the five-year term expires, the goodwill compensation stipulated in this article will terminate." (1) Does the aforementioned provision simply refer to the trademark or does it also include all new and existing customers? (2) Is the net profit from transactions resulting from the company's reputation also included in my goodwill compensation? (3) Do transactions that occur with the company due to other relationships refer to "transactions unrelated to goodwill not included in this example" or is there another meaning? (4) Does the aforementioned provision adequately express the significance of my rights? (5) If a shareholder is untrustworthy and causes me to suffer losses, what method should I use to deal with it?

[Answer from Lawyer Cao Yaxia] (1)(2)(3)(4) Current Chinese law does not have any provisions regarding "goodwill." Its content and scope should be clearly defined or interpreted by the parties involved when drafting the contract. Sir Lord Justice Lindley in England defined goodwill in a certain case as "including everything that increases the value of a business, such as location, name, reputation, patrons, related business, or any such circumstances, and others that I cannot think of," which can be used as a reference. (5) You can legally request compensation.

### Suppressing Oil Prices: City Government to Hold Meeting Today; Registration of Retailers Ends Today; Oil Price Evaluation Committee Postponed to Next Monday

[Our newspaper's report] Mayor Wu, in order to discuss cracking down on the black market for cooking oil, will convene representatives from oil mills, grain and oilseed cake businesses, grain and oilseed cake retail businesses, and the Social Affairs Bureau, China Vegetable Oil Factory, etc., at 10:00 AM today in the city government conference room for talks.

The Social Affairs Bureau originally scheduled to convene the Oil Price Evaluation Committee at 2:00 PM today, but it has been learned that it has been postponed to next Monday.

The Grain and Oilseed Cake Retail Business Association will regularly allocate 36,000 dan of low-priced cooking oil per month starting next week, so it has been handling the registration of cooking oil retail stores throughout the city (including suburban areas such as Wusong and Jiangwan) since the 14th. Today is the last day for registration, and all unregistered retailers should quickly go to register. In addition, it is said that the total number of registrations in the past two days has reached more than 700.

Yesterday's market price of raw oil was not much different from before, but the trend was still relatively stable, and transactions were scattered. Private factories, such as Dayouyu and Dachangxin, have allocated more than 200 dan of soybean oil, directly allocating it to retailers for door-to-door sales at negotiated prices.

According to the decision made at the previous meeting convened by Mayor Wu, private oil mills have been selling their stored oil to the market at limited prices every day in recent days, and have sold all of it. As for the joint distribution of 12,000 dan per month by each factory according to the current production volume, it is decided that on Monday (the 18th) of next week, manufacturers can apply for a 40 million yuan loan for those who sell 1,000 dan to the market. The Shanghai Municipal Bank's 500 million yuan cooking oil loan will allocate loan amounts to members of its oil mill association as follows: (1) Dayouyu, 160 million yuan, (2) Dachangxin, 100 million yuan, (3) Dadexin, 80 million yuan, (4) Changde, 65 million yuan, (5) Shunyu, 60 million yuan, (6) Dasheng, 20 million yuan, (7) Weimin, 15 million yuan. The association has prepared documents according to the loan amounts applied for by the above members and submitted them to the Municipal Bank for approval. As for the guarantee and collateral procedures for each factory, the association plans to have Wang Shixin, the managing director, personally visit the bank authorities next Monday morning to discuss the matter.

### City Authorities Assist Stock Exchange in Investigating Black Market for Securities; Account Books to be Checked by Supervisors; Responsible Persons to be Summoned for Testimony

Since the opening of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, the stock market trading firms in this city have been rampant, and the trend has intensified. Conducting matched trades is nothing more than a gambling transformation, violating the Stock Exchange Law and disrupting finance. The business of the stock exchange and brokers are affected, and the government is paying close attention to this. When President Song of the Executive Yuan came to Shanghai, he ordered Mayor Wu to severely crack down on it. Yesterday (the 15th) at around 11:00 AM, the city government ordered the police and social bureaus to select personnel to cooperate with the Shanghai Stock Exchange Supervisor's Office of the Ministry of Finance and Economy and personnel from the stock exchange to take action and investigate more than ten non-brokerage firms engaged in black market securities trading outside the Stock Exchange Building. All personnel present were questioned, filled out records, and signed by the interviewees. All telephone numbers were copied, and the identities of the other parties were identified. All account books were taken to the Supervisor's Office for inspection, and the responsible persons will be summoned to find a guarantor and sign a statement promising never to do it again. It is reported that since there are still many firms engaged in black market securities trading, the city government will continue to investigate thoroughly to eradicate the practice.

### Western Merchants Continue to Buy; Public Bonds Gradually Rise

Yesterday, public debt prices rose because Western merchants were still entrusting Office 333 to purchase them, and their appetite was relatively healthy, absorbing more than 4 million yuan. The upward trend was stimulated. Unified Class C bonds opened at 1,400 yuan, then fell to 1,360 yuan. When sellers stopped selling, the buying wind gradually increased, and gradually rose back to 1,640 yuan before stabilizing. As a result, compared to the previous close, Classes A, B, D, and G all rose by 150 yuan, Unified Class C bonds rose by 230 yuan, and Unified Class E bonds rose by 230 yuan. The transaction volume was no less than 8 million yuan.

### Rice Prices Continue to Rise

The difficulty of rice market supply has not decreased, and there are still more than 12,000 shi registered, but store consumption has been maintained. As the weather turns cold, retail sales have increased compared to wholesale. Northern japonica rice continued to rise by more than 1,000 yuan, and southern japonica rice rose by another 1,200 yuan. Indica rice rose by 1,000 yuan. High-quality white glutinous and brown glutinous rice have increased by varying amounts from 1,200 yuan to 2,300 yuan. Due to a shipment of 6,000-7,000 bags of Northeastern soybeans arriving in Shanghai today, people's confidence softened, and it entered a state of fatigue again, reduced by 1,000 yuan. After the decline in flour transportation costs, digestion moved slightly and rose by 200 yuan. Bran is still weak, soybean cake is down by 100 yuan, and the arrival and sale of wheat are both scarce. Peanut kernels from other ports and this street have become less willing to take in goods, falling by 3,400 yuan, forming a situation of sudden rises and sudden falls. Sesame seeds are scarce and strong, rising by 1,000 yuan. Red sorghum has decent brewery intake and remains stable. Corn from Qingdao moved slightly, and high-quality goods are expected to rise. Medium-quality goods are average. The oil market has not opened up, and allocation of door-to-door sales will be re-allocated tomorrow.

### Medium and Fine White Sugar Spot Appears

Yesterday, sugar market prices rebounded by 3,400 yuan due to the shortage of spot medium and fine white sugar. The association's quoted price for medium and fine white sugar was initially 137,500 yuan and later 140,000 yuan. Raw red sugar rose from 116,700 yuan to 119,000 yuan. Shantou traders quoted 117,000 yuan to 5,000 yuan for new deliveries and 107,800 yuan for old Huanggang green, and 115,000 yuan for cotton red.

### Artificial Silk Allocation: China Trust Strictly Audits

Since the allocation of artificial silk by the China Trust Bureau last month, it has reached eight times. The 14th was the date of the ninth allocation. The bureau still followed the original method and allocated 492 boxes according to the quantity applied for by each factory. The number of electric silk weaving industries applying this month is more than last month, and the quantity has also increased, requesting to purchase more than 3,000 boxes. After the bureau's review, 334 households were approved, and 2,322 boxes were approved. According to the person in charge of the bureau: Although the electric silk weaving industry requested a lot this month, after checking the registration cards, the number of electric machines did not match the required quantity, and there was obviously an overstatement, which was naturally reduced. In addition, the bureau decided to allocate artificial silk to the weaving tape industry and the artificial silk association according to the amount required, but there are 77 weaving tape industries, and the request is for more than 500 boxes. According to the bureau's investigation, it is believed that dozens of boxes are sufficient, so it has not yet been approved and will be submitted to the next committee for resolution. The bureau also did not allocate the quantity reported by each member of the artificial silk association, which did not list the application quantity and sales area.

### Insufficient Quota Drives Fine Yarn Prices Wildly; Cotton Cloth Prices Close to Manufacturing Costs

[Our newspaper's report] Yesterday's yarn market was still extremely firm, with 20-count yarn continuing to rise by 35,000, and buying and selling were not enthusiastic. For example, Extra Double Horse was priced from 2,320,000 to 2,350,000, and ordinary Double Horse Jincheng also traded at 2,156,000. The 42-count yarn, because the allocated yarn is not suitable for application, various weaving factories are searching for it on the market, and the price has jumped by 200,000. For example, the Blue Phoenix brand has been traded at more than 3,700,000, and the supply is still short.

Cloth market transportation costs are rising daily, and have approached manufacturing costs. Recently, due to the tight yarn supply, general yarn factories are willing to exchange cloth for yarn, and cloth factories are also willing to barter. In short, inventory is scarce, and as soon as demand moves, prices rise. As soon as it stagnates, it flows downstream. Yesterday, high-quality fine cloth was priced at 87,500 yuan, and other colorful balls and blue chickens also rose by 3,400 yuan, etc. However, serge did not rise much in price.

### Gold Prices Initially Level, Then Rise; US Dollar Continues to Rise

Yesterday, gold was extremely stable before 11:30 am. Near noon, news of buying assistance spread, and buying immediately increased. The morning opening was 2,453,000, and it was extremely stable after opening. Although the demand was strong, there was also pressure. The high price was 2,458,000, and it immediately fell back, gradually retreating to within 2,440,000 before stabilizing. The Central Bank allocated 100 bars at a price of 2,440,000. After 10 o'clock, it dragged on in a stable state, always hovering around 2,450,000, with no other changes. It was delayed until after 11:30 am when buying suddenly increased. At noon, it rose to 2,490,000 before slightly falling back. In the afternoon, the next-day delivery went from level to firm, and was pushed from around 2,475,000 to 2,490,000 again. People's hearts are extremely easily excited. As a result, it closed 42,000 higher than the previous close. Gold ornaments rose to 260,000, silver ingots to 3,600, silver dollars continued to rise, unofficial silver interest rates were stable, and interest rates were still around 12%.

Foreign currencies continued to flourish. The black market US dollar started at 4,380 yuan and gradually improved, rising to above 4,500 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, there were widespread rumors in the market that the government would be reorganized, and new purchases poured in. Finally, it rose to above 4,700 yuan, continuing to rise by more than half a percentage point compared to the previous close. Hong Kong dollars rose from around 900 yuan in the early morning to above 920 yuan, also rising by 30 yuan. Hong Kong exchange rates rose to around 910 yuan, Indian exchange rates to 1,100 yuan, and British exchange rates to 14,700 yuan. US exchange rates remained unchanged. Transactions were mostly in Hong Kong exchange rates, and the rest were sluggish.

### News of Buying Assistance Spreads; Chinese Stocks Turn Upward in the Afternoon

Chinese stocks were even more miserable yesterday morning. Apart from a little arbitrage trading in the banking sector, there was little interest inside and outside the industry. After opening, people were timid and scrambling to cut losses, and the market immediately fell sharply. After 10 o'clock, Xinhua and others took advantage of the low prices to arbitrage, but in terms of delivery, they could not withstand the selling pressure from current delivery, and the firm trend was difficult to sustain. Halfway through, it almost became the world of sellers, and it fell again and again. After Tongyi reached the limit down, it stabilized slightly. "Delivery" Yonggong took the lead in breaking the limit down record. Although there was a temporary rebound from short covering after 11:30, there were few supporters, and the upward trend was temporary. Near noon, the atmosphere became even worse, and under the circumstances of liquidation, it fell to low prices. As a result, compared to the previous close, mature stocks such as Yongsha, Meyer, Xinyi, Jingfu, and Qinxing each fell by about 10%, Xinguang only fell by half a percent, and cold stocks such as Rongfeng, Tongyi, Huochai Gongsi, and Lian each fell by more than 10%, and the rest all fell slightly. Delivery Yongsha fell by 5%, and Yonggong fell by 15% (only the selling price of Zhu was obtained, so the stock exchange only had a price of 217 yuan, and no record of 204 yuan. The rest all fell by about 10%. In the afternoon, it was heard that the stock exchange searched many off-exchange trading firms in the yarn and cloth building, coupled with the news of the reorganization of the National Government, which stimulated the largest buying wind, and major matching households were keen to cover shorts. The widespread buying wind on the table was even more intense because it was a week later for delivery, and prices continued to rise. Apart from the sluggish stocks, almost all the others closed at high prices. As a result, compared to the previous close, hot stock Yongsha rose alone, and the rest all fell slightly. Xinyi was still level, and cold stock Xinya was still stable. The rest ranged from a slight decrease to a fall of no more than 10%. Delivery Yongsha was level, Meyer, Xinyi, Jingfu, and Xinguang fell slightly, and Yonggong had previously fallen to the limit down in the morning, but there were no transactions. In the afternoon, there were no listings, making it difficult to count. The off-exchange stocks were relatively peaceful.

Since foreign stocks only opened for trading in the morning, under adverse circumstances, each stock had fewer sellers and more buyers, and no one maintained them. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yisha and British-American fell slightly, Steel Industry Wheelock fell by half a percent, and Yeguang, Paper Industry, Yipi, and Aviation each fell by less than 10%.

### Ningxia Wool: 1,000 Yuan per Jin; Freight Costs 1,800 Yuan

[Nanjing News] Mr. Qiao Senrong, a representative from Ningxia Province attending the National Federation of Industry and Commerce, said that the province's production is mainly wool and salt. Due to inconvenient transportation, it is difficult to transport them out. Currently, the market price of ordinary wool in Ningxia Province is 1,000 yuan per jin. If transported to Tianjin or Shanghai, the freight cost per jin would increase by 1,800 yuan. Recently, Australian wool arriving in Shanghai is cheap and of good quality, so Ningxia wool merchants do not see any profit in exporting to Shanghai and are unwilling to export wool.

### Japanese Yarn Shipped South

### Taiwan Sugar Adds Machinery; Aims to Increase Production to 400,000 Tons

[Our Newspaper News] In order to increase Taiwan's sugar production, the Taiwan Sugar Corporation is ordering sugar-making machinery from Ross Corporation of the United States to supplement the wartime losses in the area. Negotiations are ongoing and a contract has not yet been signed. The planned production for the next year is to increase to 400,000 tons. The total demand for China is 700,000 tons, and Taiwan's highest production in the past was 1.3 million tons.

### Implementing Southward Transportation of Yarn and Cloth; Offices Established in Guangzhou and Shantou

The Spinning and Weaving Control Committee has decided that the first batch of goods to be shipped out since the implementation of management of yarn and cloth transportation to South China will be 2,000 pieces of yarn and cloth and 35,000 bolts of cloth, which will be shipped out next week. In order to facilitate management, the committee has dispatched special commissioners to establish offices in Guangzhou and Shantou. The commissioner for Guangzhou is Feng Mo, and the commissioner for Shantou is Shen Zhaohai. For Fuzhou and Xiamen, the local municipal governments will assist.

### Cotton Cloth Merchants Must Re-register

[Our newspaper's report] There are more than 1,300 cotton cloth merchants registered with the Business Department of the China Textile Construction Company. Now, the Textile Construction Company has announced that the number of requests from various manufacturers to change registration and exchange seals has been increasing daily. For the purpose of reorganization, a special notice was issued yesterday requiring each merchant to bring the original seal to the Investigation Section of the Business Department of the company before the 25th of this month to collect a blank registration card and re-register. Those who fail to do so by the deadline will be deemed to have voluntarily given up.

### Fine Yarn Profitable; Firewood Cotton Has Difficulty Finding a Way Out

[Our newspaper's report] Firewood cotton produced in Pudong, this city, has recently lacked buyers. The association believes that the purchase of firewood cotton is greatly related to the livelihoods of cotton farmers in Pudong. They have submitted a request to the Shanghai Cotton Business Association in this city, asking them to request that each yarn factory purchase it on their behalf. The industry association convened a board of directors meeting yesterday afternoon and decided to send a letter to Mayor Wu, asking him to persuade each yarn factory not to specialize in spinning with foreign cotton because fine yarn is profitable. It is also hoped that they can spin more of the 16-count or lower yarns in order to use as much domestic cotton as possible and maintain the livelihoods of cotton farmers. In addition, the industry association believes that the reports on the market prices of various raw cottons in this city are either not uniform or accurate. They now plan to designate a certain time to report the market prices of each grade of raw cotton to the Shanghai Radio Station in this city every day for reference by all sectors.

### Before the Commencement of Commodity Tax: Fixed Orders and Inventory are Tax-Exempt

After the commencement of the new taxes on seven items such as wheat flour and cement, all of the above-mentioned goods will be subject to tax in accordance with regulations when they leave the factory. However, there is some doubt as to whether manufacturers should pay taxes on orders accepted before the commencement of the tax that have not yet left the factory after the commencement of the tax. The Commodity Tax Bureau of this city recently received instructions from the Ministry of Finance that manufacturers are allowed to report such orders to the commodity tax authority for investigation and verification within three days of the publication of the commodity tax authority's announcement, along with the order contract and legal documents, and to check the relevant account books. They are allowed to leave the factory tax-free before the end of November of this year. Applications or tax exemptions will not be allowed after the deadline. As for the inventory that has been sold on the market before the commencement of the tax, it was previously stipulated that it would be tax-free for local sales by the end of October of this year. Now, the deadline has been extended to November. However, the above-mentioned fixed orders and inventory that are transported out or into other ports shall still be taxed in accordance with regulations.

### Export Invoices

Request for Exemption from Affixing Stamp Tax Stamps: Trade Association Appeals

It is reported that the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau recently designated foreign exchange banks to check whether the invoices attached by export merchants when applying for foreign exchange settlement have been affixed with stamp tax stamps at the rate of 3 per thousand. If they have not been affixed, the banks must transfer them to the bureau for legal action. The China Import and Export Trade Association believes that the domestic commodity prices, transportation, and interest rates are continuing to rise, and the export situation is extremely unfavorable. The payment of stamp tax on export invoices will increase costs even more. In addition, stamp tax has already been paid when export merchants purchase goods from various places. Now, because of operating exports, they have to bear huge expenses again, which involves double taxation. Therefore, it appealed to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs on behalf of them yesterday, requesting that they be allowed to be exempted from affixing stamps.

### Opinions of the American Tung Oil Expert: Supply Only One-Third of Demand, Improve Quality and Reduce Exploitation

Dr. Curry, an American member of the Sino-American Agricultural Technology Group and a tung oil expert, was dispatched to China in June of this year to investigate the current state of tung oil production. Yesterday, he arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing and will fly back to the United States. Before his departure, he shared his opinions on improving China's tung oil industry with reporters: (1) Currently, China's tung oil production has sharply decreased to only half of its pre-war level. It is estimated that this year's output will be no more than 60,000 metric tons, equivalent to approximately 133 million pounds. The main reason for this reduction is the low price of tung oil during the war, making tung tree planting unprofitable. (2) Tung oil is the best drying oil. If prices are reasonable, the market is stable, and the supply is normal, the world's consumption could reach 500 million pounds (approximately 227,700 metric tons). This year's global tung oil production is estimated to be no more than 155 million pounds, only a little less than one-third of global consumption. China must rapidly increase production to meet global demand. If the current supply shortage persists, tung oil's industrial applications will gradually be taken over by other drying oils and substitutes. (3) Tung oil production is scattered, making it impossible to use new extraction methods. The quality is inconsistent, and adulteration is common. In the future, production must be centralized to reduce costs and improve quality. (4) Tung trees are not forest products. They should not be left to grow on their own but should be treated as horticultural crops, managed using methods similar to fruit tree cultivation. This includes selecting superior varieties, focusing on asexual reproduction, planting in fertile soil, weeding, fertilizing, and controlling pests and diseases to maximize their productive capacity. (5) Tung oil is currently mostly produced in mountainous areas, making transportation difficult. There are too many intermediaries, and tung farmers' profits are too small. It is necessary to improve transportation and marketing, reduce freight costs, and decrease the exploitation by intermediaries to encourage farmers to expand tung tree planting. Dr. Curry concluded with a firm tone, stating that in the next five years, increasing the quantity of tung oil should be prioritized over improving its quality. Production increases must be rapid and planned, ensuring that production, manufacturing, transportation, and marketing are integrated.

### The Price of White Coal Declines: More Arriving, Sales Slow

Since the market price of white coal lump coal has fallen, sales have remained difficult to expand. Sellers are unwilling to further lower prices due to cost considerations, unless there are large-volume buyers who can negotiate prices, about 50,000 to 100,000 yuan lower than the market price. As deliveries continue to arrive, the market is quite weak. Yesterday, more than 2,000 tons of Hongji lump coal were shipped from Nanchang and are currently being unloaded at a warehouse of the Shanghai Fuel Management Committee in Pudong. Additionally, several truckloads of Jiaozuo lump coke have arrived at the McGann Road Station, with each truck carrying approximately 20 to 30 tons. Meanwhile, the bituminous coal market remains brisk due to the scarcity of allocated goods and strong demand from factories. Traders are bidding up prices for allocated goods, with premiums reaching 4.424 million yuan per unit.

### Amendments to the Commodity Tax Regulations

(Passed by the Legislative Yuan on November 11) (Continued)

Article 4. The commodity tax rates are as follows:

(1) Cigarettes: 100% ad valorem tax.

(2) Tobacco: 30% ad valorem tax.

(3) Imported wine and beer: 100% ad valorem tax.

(4) Matches: 20% ad valorem tax.

(5) Sugar: 25% ad valorem tax.

(6) Cotton yarn: 5% ad valorem tax.

(7) Wheat flour: 2.5% ad valorem tax.

(8) Cement: 15% ad valorem tax.

(9) Tea: 10% ad valorem tax.

(10) Furs: 15% ad valorem tax.

(11) Tin foil and spirit money: 60% ad valorem tax.

(12) Beverages: 20% ad valorem tax.

(13) Cosmetics: 45% ad valorem tax.

Article 5. The taxable value of goods subject to commodity tax shall be based on the average wholesale price of the nearby market of the place of production over a three-month period. The aforementioned average wholesale price shall include (a) the dutiable value of the goods, (b) the amount of the original commodity tax paid, which is the dutiable value of the goods multiplied by the tax rate, and (c) the cost of transporting the goods from the place of production to the nearby market, which is set at 10% of the dutiable value.

Average wholesale price in the nearby market of the place of production × 100 ÷ (100 + the commodity tax rate + cost of transportation from the place of production to the nearby market, i.e., 10) = assessed dutiable value

For the convenience of tax collection, the Ministry of Finance may, at its discretion, adopt a tiered tax system for goods subject to commodity tax. The tiered tax calculation methods shall be determined by the Ministry of Finance. (To be continued)

### Caustic Soda Plummets: Unprofitable for Out-of-Town Sales

The price of caustic soda plummeted by 100,000 yuan per barrel yesterday. According to industry insiders, this is because the price in other areas is similar to that in Shanghai, so out-of-town merchants have no intention of exporting. Various parties are selling off their stocks at high prices to obtain cash, confirming that the recent surge was mostly speculative. Further declines are possible. Bleaching powder and sulfur are arriving.

### Sales of Subsidized Flour Narrowing: Hoping for Reduced Allocation Prices

[Reported by this newspaper] According to flour industry sources, the various flour mills in the city can now produce 30,000 bags of flour per day. Of these, 12,000 bags are allocated to flour merchants for subsidized sales, while the remaining 18,000 bags are mostly sold by the flour mills themselves on the black market. As a result, the black market price of flour has fallen to 19,200 yuan per bag in recent days. However, the subsidized flour still costs 20,500 yuan per bag. Therefore, the sales of subsidized flour are narrowing, and the number of people going to purchase it daily has decreased to 6,000 bags. Therefore, there is a strong hope that the authorities can reconsider reducing the price of allocated flour.

### Commemorating World Student Day: Rallies to Be Held in Nanjing and Shanghai Tomorrow, Telegram to the World Student Association to Express Respect

[Reported by this newspaper] Tomorrow (the 17th) is "World Student Day." During World War II, after the German army occupied Czechoslovakia, it suppressed the patriotic movement of Czech students through massacres and arrests. Starting on November 17, 1939, students and professors in Prague and other major Czech cities were subjected to mass killings, resulting in thousands of deaths. The remaining students were mostly detained in concentration camps, and all higher education institutions were closed. The World Student Congress designated this day as World Student Day in 1941. The first World Student Day commemoration was held in New York on November 17, 1942, with student representatives from thirty Allied countries signing and issuing a joint declaration. A commemoration was held in London in 1943, and China held a commemoration in Chongqing in the same year. In 1944, the British National Union of Students decided to hold another commemoration in London, and Chinese youth also held a commemoration in Chongqing. This year, the fourth Chinese commemoration will be held in Nanjing and Shanghai tomorrow, and a telegram will be sent to the World Student Association in the name of the conference to express respect, strengthen the unity of world students, and promote lasting world peace.

Another report: At 9 a.m. tomorrow, students from various schools in the city will hold a World Student Day commemoration at the Municipal Gymnasium. In addition to students from various universities and colleges in the city, students from the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, France, and other Allied countries in Shanghai will also participate. According to reliable sources, Mayor Wu, Wang Chonghui, Zhu Jingnong, Gu Yuxiu, Li Ximou, and others will attend and deliver speeches. A grand parade will be held after the meeting.

### Flora Sinensis to Begin Compilation

[Reported by the Central News Agency, Beiping, on the 15th] Botanist Hu Xiansu, director of the Fan Memorial Institute of Biology, arrived in Beiping from Shanghai the day before yesterday. He stated that the recent meeting of the Academia Sinica approved a letter from Dr. Elmer Drew Merrill of Harvard University requesting the Institute of Botany of Academia Sinica, the Institute of Botany of the Beiping Academy, and the Fan Memorial Institute of Biology to jointly compile "Flora Sinensis" with the United States. This work will take more than ten years. Hu also discussed with the Central Agricultural Experiment Station of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry the compilation of "Illustrated Manual of Chinese Forest Trees," which will be edited by Hu. This book will be an extremely important reference book for China, as the United States only has over 600 species of plants, while China has over 2,000 species. The new pine and cypress family plant discovered by him in Shuangqing and Wanxian, similar to the American "Sequoia," is named Metasequoia, with a lifespan of approximately 2,000 years. This Metasequoia tree has been cut in half but is still 34 meters high. This type of plant completely disappeared from Europe, America, Japan, Sakhalin Island, and other places due to the Ice Age millions of years ago.

### Coffin to Lecture in Shanghai: From the 18th to the 22nd

World-renowned scholar Dr. H.S. Coffin has come to China to lecture under the auspices of the American Cushwa Foundation.

It is now learned that Dr. Coffin arrived in Shanghai this week and will give public lectures at the Xintian'an Church on Suzhou Road from the 18th to the 22nd, every afternoon at 4:30 p.m. All are welcome to attend freely.

### Student Public Funding Issues: Unified Regulations Established

The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau recently received instructions from the Ministry of Education regarding student public funding issues, establishing unified regulations. The main points are: All discharged youth soldiers who have been approved for distribution by the ministry, regardless of whether they originally received public funding, will be given full public funding, without being restricted by their original allocation. Those who have not been distributed by the Ministry of Education are not subject to this. For displaced youth whose family economic sources have been cut off, and who have obtained feasible proof documents, if verified to be true, the school may submit a special case to the ministry for approval to grant public funding outside the prescribed quota. The granting of public funding to distributed students in the various temporary university preparatory classes shall be handled in accordance with the prescribed methods.

It is heard that all procedures have been completed, and each school concurrently operating a civil school can go to claim the funds starting tomorrow.

### UNESCO General Conference to Be Held in Paris: Representatives from Forty-Four Countries to Attend

[Reuters, Paris, 15th] The General Conference of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) is scheduled to convene here on November 19 and continue until December 10. Forty-four countries will participate, each sending five representatives. The Soviet Union has also been invited, but has not yet indicated its willingness to participate. Sweden and Switzerland have been invited to send observers.

Complete Permanent Form

One of the main goals of this conference is to complete the permanent form of the organization. Since its establishment in London last November, the organization has been operating on a temporary basis, with the temporary secretariat led by Dr. Huxley. At this conference, a Director-General with a six-year term will be elected, and a secretariat will be established. At the same time, the plans of the various departments of the organization will be discussed and approved. The main departments include education, natural sciences, social sciences, fine arts, literature, philosophy, mass communication (newspapers, radio, film), libraries, museums, news, and war-torn areas. The purpose of UNESCO is to promote the highest level of exchange of information, ideas, and inventions among scientists, educators, and intellectuals from various countries.

Prevent International Crises

The report to be submitted by the preparatory committee to the conference states that there are two ways to maintain peace in the modern world: one is to establish institutions to prevent war when international crises occur, and the other is to cultivate society so that crises do not arise. With the welfare of mankind as the greatest premise, respect and understanding between countries can be promoted. After World War I, emphasis was placed on the first method. After World War II, both methods have been given equal importance. The success of UNESCO is a prerequisite for the development of international relations. Today, people base their hopes for peace, prosperity, and a friendly world on such relations. This organization is an important tool for cultivating peace and preventing war. The evolution of modern tactics and the increasing degree of destruction of civilization have further increased the importance of this organization. Unless UNESCO and other organizations aimed at safeguarding human welfare are successful, we will not have the opportunity to understand the ability of human thought.

Arranged Commemorative Programs

To commemorate this UNESCO conference, Paris has organized a "UNESCO Month," in which cultural figures from twenty countries will participate. Symphony orchestras from Paris, Liège, Amsterdam, and Prague will perform in Paris. The Paris Opera will perform a special program, including performances of Chinese opera. In addition, there will be dance performances, lectures, art, science, and education exhibitions.

### Children's Education Lecture to Be Held Tomorrow

The Children's Education Lecture, organized by the Elementary School Teachers' Joint Training Association, is scheduled to be held at 2 p.m. this Sunday afternoon at Peiming Girls' High School, located at the intersection of Xinzha Road and Hart Road. Shen Youqian will speak on "Children's Intelligence."

### Tense but Not Exciting: Black and White Loses to the Zheng Lun Team by One Point, 55 to 53, Black and White Women's Team Gets off to a Good Start

[Reported by this newspaper] In their second game last night, the Filipino-Chinese Black and White basketball team faced the strong Luoyang Zheng Lun team. After a 40-minute battle, Black and White unfortunately lost by a score of 55 to 53. In the first half, Black and White led by three points with a score of 25 to 22. The game was close, with the score difference remaining between two and three points. Only in the final minutes did Zheng Lun score consecutively, finally deciding the outcome of the game.

Equally Matched, Tough Fight

Last night's game can be described as evenly matched. Although the tension was high, there were not many exciting moments. Zheng Lun was less impressive than usual, with disorganized tactics and inaccurate shooting. Black and White was also relying on tough play, without showing much strategy. Therefore, all that was seen was both sides fighting hard and randomly shooting. Black and White's shooting was also not as accurate as Qunsheng, and the play was not as beautiful as Qunsheng's, which was quite disappointing. Neither side was confident of winning, which was not the state of a political party. While the Black and White men's team suffered a setback, the women's team got off to a good start and performed quite well.

Black and White Women's Team Gets off to a Good Start

At 5:45 p.m., the women's teams took the court. The Black and White women's team made its debut, facing off against the Qing Lian team. Before the game, the captains of both teams exchanged pennants. Xu Peizhen of Qing Lian opened the scoring, and Chen Yurun of Black and White responded in kind. At the end of the first quarter, Black and White led ten to eight. At the end of the first half, Black and White was far ahead with a score of 37 to 15. After the break, the game resumed. Wang Wuli and Jian Zhiguang of Qing Lian replaced Liu Huishan and Hu Yuru. However, Qing Lian became even more sluggish, while Black and White continued to play with great ease. At the end of the third quarter, Black and White led 44 to Qing Lian's 17. As a result, the Black and White women's team defeated Qing Lian 49 to 29, getting off to a good start.

Fierce Competition, Difficult to Separate

Following this, the Black and White men's team met the Zheng Lun team. Qu Honglu and Zheng Zhifang served as referees. Black and White fielded Chuan Yongxin, Guo Guoye, Cai Jin, Ye Kexi, and Lin Ziyi, while Zheng Lun fielded Qian Ruizhang, Tu Wenlong, Cai Zhongqiang, Wang Binghuan, and Liu Zhengjun. After the initial contact, a fierce competition unfolded. Cai Jin of Black and White was the first to score, and Tu Wenlong of Zheng Lun responded in kind. The score was tied again at 4 and 6. Zheng Lun's offense was fierce, but their shots were inaccurate. Black and White replaced Chuan Yongxin with Xiao Bingtuo. At the end of the first quarter, Pian Lun led 10 to 8. When the game resumed, Black and White tied the score. Qian Ruizhang of Pian Lun scored twice, again taking the lead. Lin Ziyi of Black and White scored on a free throw, tying the score at 15 to 15. The two sides were evenly matched and difficult to separate. The scores of both sides rose and fell, with a difference of one or two points. As a result of the first half, Black and White came from behind to lead 25 to 21.

Victory Decided in the Final Quarter

In the third quarter, the competition between the two sides became even more intense, and the battle situation was extremely tense. Tu Guanglong scored first, and Xiao Huatu broke through the blue with one hand. The two teams tied again, with each side scoring 37 points. When the score was tied at 37, Wang Binghuan of Zheng Lun was disqualified for his fifth foul, and Zhang Gengsheng entered the game. At the end of the third quarter, Black and White led by only one point, with a score of 40 to 39. In the final quarter, both sides fought with all their strength. General Guo Guoye of Black and White was also disqualified for his fifth foul, and Ye Kexi entered as a substitute. When the score was 43 to 40, Xiao Huatu left the court due to a hand injury, and Li Jinzao entered the game. Tu Wenlong and Liu Zhengjun of Zheng Lun made long shots and close shots, taking the lead with a score of 46 to 44 in an instant. However, Black and White kept pressing hard, and the score rose and fell. There were several ties, and when the statutory time ended, Zheng Lun defeated Black and White by a difference of two points with a score of 55 to 53.

### Hu Tigian, Director of the Jilin Education Department, Discusses Modern Culture in Northeast China: Expressing the Tenacity of the Chinese Nation

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 14th] Hu Tigian, Director of the Jilin Education Department, told reporters that modern culture in Northeast China can be divided into three periods. The first period is the culture of the "Zhangbaoren" (Zhangbaoren means those in charge of the moneybags), which should be the Manchu Qing Dynasty and its final years up until the "September 18th" Incident. At that time, the local people and those who moved from Hebei and Shandong to the Songliao River basin were mostly engaged in various industries, all with Zhangbaoren who had foresight and creativity regarding their careers and environment. They were extremely important in developing the culture of Northeast China. This can be compared to the Jeffersonian figures of the American West development. The second period is the culture of "those who must be inspected" (this is a Japanese term, referring to those who were conquered but not yet willing to submit, and must be guarded against), which should be after the "September 18th" Incident. Since the "September 18th" Incident, the people of Northeast China had their hearts set on the motherland, and constantly resisted violence. The Japanese used the manpower and resources of Northeast China to carry out construction, but the essence of the culture did not change. This can be compared to the gray literature of the late Tsarist era in Russia. The third period is the culture of employees, which is since the victory. The great expression of various employees in Northeast China doing their best to preserve various constructions amidst the chaos. Their struggles of life and career, such as the railway workers in Jinzhou resisting those who set fires, and the preservation of the Xiaofengman Power Plant, are all prominent examples. This is truly a unique expression of the tenacity of the Chinese national character. Hu is from Changchun, studied sociology at the University of Chicago for five years, and previously served as the director of the law school at Guangzhou University.

### Group A Football League: Dragon and Jie to Meet Jewish Team Today at 3 PM in Jinyuan Park

Brief Reports on Civil Affairs

### Holders of Candidate Qualification Notices May Directly Apply for Certificates: Examination Committee Informs City Government to Notify Subordinates

A letter from the Examination Committee of the Municipal Government stated that, after investigation, those who are qualified for civil service positions at the county level and who have passed the examination are, in accordance with the regulations on issuing documents of qualification and simultaneously recognizing qualifications for provincial and county civil service candidate examinations, issued a qualification notice by the committee with a qualification stamp on the document. Those who have previously passed the examination and requested qualification recognition, and have been approved by the Examination Yuan to be issued a notice, the qualification notice has the same validity as a qualification certificate. Since the implementation of this procedure, there has been an increasing number of people who have obtained the qualification notice and then applied to the committee for a qualification certificate. In order to adapt to this practical situation and encourage participation in qualification recognition, it has been approved by the Examination Yuan that those who hold the qualification notice from the committee and wish to exchange it for a certificate may submit the notice and a certificate fee of thirty yuan, plus postage according to the postal regulations for each registered mail item, directly to the Secretariat of the Examination Yuan for exchange. Please inform all subordinate units of this matter. It is reported that the municipal government has approved the letter and is circulating it to the district offices for notification.

### Each District Increases the Number of Shack Areas and Selects Jia Heads for Approval

The Forty-sixth and Forty-seventh Baos of the Third District (Yimiao) reported that residents in each Bao were building shacks and registering households, resulting in several cases daily where the original number of households in each Jia could not be accommodated. It was proposed to add two Jia of shack residents to the Forty-sixth Bao, designated as Thirty-seventh and Thirty-eighth Jia, with Yang Guifu and Zhou Shaoxia selected to serve as Jia heads. Additionally, twelve Jia of shack residents were added to the Forty-seventh Bao, designated as Twenty-eighth Jia to Thirty-ninth Jia, with Gu Xiaoshi, Cen Guanglong, Chen Jinming, Wan Jiusheng, Song Jiquan, Ge Jixin, Wu Tianzhang, Jin Chongbang, Ren Longbiao, Chen Fuding, Ge Changqing, and Wang Zengfu selected as Jia heads for each Jia. After the district office sent personnel to verify the facts, the matter was forwarded to the municipal government for approval.

### District Briefs

In the Thirty-first District (Gaoqiao), Zhang Jiansheng of the Twenty-fourth Bao resigned from his position as a district representative. The vacancy has been filled by the alternate Luo Bingwen, and the district has reported this to the municipal government for approval.

In the Nineteenth District (Yulin), Li Hongqing, the deputy Bao head of the Sixth Bao, has resigned, which has been approved. The district plans to appoint Wu Deming to fill the vacancy and has submitted a request to the municipal government for approval.

In the Seventeenth District (North Sichuan Road), as of the end of September, 17,894 national identity cards for men and 13,014 for women have been issued, totaling 38,208 cards issued.

### White Sails and Green Waters, the Beautiful Scenery of Andong

— Special Correspondent of this Newspaper in the Northeast, Han Qingtao, from a Telegram on the 9th

The clear waters of the Yalu River flow along the Sino-Korean border. Originating from Mount Paektu, it meanders for over two hundred li before flowing into the Yellow Sea. The sight of white sails and interconnected "rafts" forms a magnificent spectacle on the Yalu River.

Small boats can travel upstream to the Thirteen Gou area west of Changbai. Medium-sized boats travel between the upper and lower reaches of Andong. Large ships mostly anchor at Duoshi Island at the river's mouth. The Yalu River plays a significant role in navigation.

In the upper reaches of the Yalu River, from Linjiang to Changbai, the mountains are steep, and the peaks tower as high as eight hundred to one thousand meters. There are dense forests. According to Japanese estimates, the forest area on both banks is more than 162,600 miles, but unplanned logging has caused considerable damage. Merchants cut down trees and form rafts, some as long as a li, which float downstream to the Dajiang Bridge in Andong City. The peak season for rafting is from June to August. The banks of the river are piled high with timber, so Andong also has the title of "Timber Capital."

In addition to timber, which ranks first, the goods that float down from the upper reaches include soybeans, bean cakes, sorghum, corn, small red beans, and silkworm cocoons. The goods shipped from Andong City include cotton, silk, cloth, salt, flour, kerosene, matches, and other necessities for the people in the upper reaches. The cargo transportation between Andong and the estuary mainly consists of exports and imported fabrics. The Yalu River above Andong is frozen from late November to March of the following year.

During the Republic of China in 1943, the Japanese puppets built a dam to build the "Shuifeng" hydroelectric power plant, preventing rafts from reaching Andong City directly. Therefore, standing at the Yalu River Bridge, one can no longer see the large "rafts." In addition, the upper reaches of the Yalu River are still unstable, and all cargo transportation must wait until early summer next year!

The Unfrozen [Dadong Port]

The construction of "Dadong Port" during the enemy and puppet period was also a significant project worthy of attention. The port is located at the mouth of the Yalu River and is naturally formed. Once completed, it could become the only unfrozen good port in the Northeast. Behind the port is an area designated for a city with a population of one million and a large industrial zone, covering an area of 176 square kilometers, with the intention of creating a large industrial city.

General Du Yuming, in order to see the situation of Dadong Port, ordered the plane to fly south when he inspected the war situation in Andong City and flew back to Shenyang. The reporters accompanied him. The plane circled over Dadong Port. The sea was vast, and the Yalu River lost its green color and turned into a torrent of muddy water flowing into the sea. A string of small mountains extended into the sea, forming a good harbor and gateway, with a magnificent atmosphere. What was strange was that no construction work was seen.

The construction goal of Dadong Port was to allow ships with a deadweight of 4,000 tons and a draft of 7.4 meters to navigate freely at high tide, and to have wharves and warehouses sufficient for four cargo ships to load and unload simultaneously. A 24-kilometer-long railway was to be built from Dadong Port directly to Andong City. When completed, it could become an important port among the four major ports in the Northeast.

Mountains and Fields Full of Treasures

Andong, only the area along the river and sea in Andong City and County forms a narrow plain. The rest of the northwest is mostly mountainous, so mineral resources are abundant. The most famous are the iron ore in Huanren and Kuandian, which have already been mined extensively. Kuandian also has tungsten ore, which is planned to be mined. Fengcheng has lead mines. The mines are located in the Qingchengzi area, which was previously mined by the puppet "Manzhou Mining Qingchengzi Mining Office." The ore contains small amounts of silver and zinc, producing 12,000 tons of lead per month, making it one of the leading lead-producing areas in China. Andong has copper mines, which were mined by the puppet "Shimizu Mining Office." The copper content is 30%, and the monthly processing volume is 15 tons. In addition, the province also has various mineral resources such as asbestos, mica, magnetite, gold, silver, fluorite, limestone, and coal.

The former puppet Tonghua Province was assigned to Andong after the restoration, including Changbai, Fusong, Linjiang, Tonghua, Jian, Huinan, Jinchuan, Liuhe, and Mengjiang, which is another large mineral resource area. Iron, coal, gold, silver, copper, lead, cadmium, platinum, mercury, asbestos, mica, graphite, limestone, refractory clay, iron sulfide, etc. are all very abundant. It is said that the coal reserves account for 20% of the total reserves in the Northeast. During the puppet Manchukuo period, most of the coal and iron mines were developed by the "Dongbiandao Development Company." At the same time, iron was smelted in the mining areas. At that time, in addition to the Japanese-controlled coal mines, there were also 13 coal mines such as the Hunjiang Coal Mine, which were all under the jurisdiction of the "Tonghua Province Coal Mine Association" established in 1942 by the puppet Manchukuo. The main mineral resources developed by the Japanese "Dongbiandao Development Company" included the Dalizi Iron Mountain in Linjiang County, the Qidaogou Iron Mountain in Tonghua City, the Tiezichanzi Coal Mountain, the Wudaojiang Coal Mountain, the Yourengou Coalfield, and the Yantonggou Coal Mountain. Gold, silver, and placer gold are mostly found in the Yalu River area. Silver, copper, mica, and graphite mines are in Jian. Limestone is in Tonghua. Liuhe, Huinan, and Jinchuan are all vast limestone areas. Limestone is an essential raw material for the iron and steel industry. In the past, seven mines were opened. Today, the land is still unstable, and everything is expected in the future!

[Timber Capital] and [Forest Province]

Andong has the title of "Timber Capital." The former puppet Tonghua Province, which was assigned to Andong after the restoration, is also known as the "Forest Province." The forests extending from the foot of Mount Changbai to Huinan in the northwest are lush, forming a vast and verdant sea of trees. In addition, the original forests of Jingyuan have been mostly deforested due to arbitrary logging.

The railways that were just recovered by the National Army have been thoroughly destroyed by the Communist Army. The rails have been lost, and the sleepers have been burned. It takes a lot of effort to collect the rails, but without the wood, they cannot be laid. The route from Ye Baishou to Chifeng, the route from Shenyang to Hailong, and the section of the Pan'an line are all in this situation. Therefore, the number of sleepers needed is quite large and alarming!

The National Army has recovered Andong, and the problem of the lack of sleepers can be partially solved. At the same time, there will be materials for the support and scaffolding wood needed for mining. The Andong Provincial Government has sent the Director of the Construction Department and others to inspect the forest area between Huinan and Mengjiang for logging in order to restore traffic as soon as possible.

Fragrant Rice and Fat Fish

Andong, which is said to have a population of five million, contains more than 200,000 Japanese and Koreans. Now, most of the Japanese and Koreans have been repatriated, and only a few remain. In the past, the Japanese were the rulers, technicians, and merchants, and the Koreans mostly grew rice and served as accomplices. This time, when the National Army entered the city and General Du arrived in Andong for inspection, Korean men, women, and children held the eight-trigram national flags and lined up to welcome them, raising their hands and shouting long live.

Education in Andong has not developed reasonably because most of the area is located in closed mountainous areas. Among them, Andong City, Zhuanghe, Fengcheng, and Tonghua are relatively better. The lack of teachers, the lack of funding, and the low level of students are serious problems at present.

Farmers still account for the majority of the population. Andong's rice is very famous, especially in Fengcheng, where the rice produced is very delicious. There are also some fishermen because Andong City to Zhuanghe has about 300 miles of coastline, where shrimp, eels, hairtail, small shrimp, yellow croaker, and whitefish are abundant. During the puppet regime, it was planned to build a marine fishing port on Da Wujia Island in Zhuanghe and plant seaweed seedlings there in order to transplant abalone and shellfish. There are also many hunters and herbal medicine collectors active in the deep mountains. For example, Tonghua Province's famous specialty, medicinal ginseng, can produce 400,000 catties per year. There are also many animal skins, mountain products, and medicinal herbs. In addition, tussah silkworm breeding, silk reeling, and silk weaving are also very famous. There are many silk factories in Badaogou at the foot of Yuanbaoshan Mountain in Andong City.

In recent years, Andong Province's emerging industries have been quite developed. Automobiles, cement, shipbuilding, textiles, rubber, refining, and light metal industries all have good products. It is a pity that after the restoration, foreigners moved away, and the destruction by our own people is now unknown how to remedy.

Good Hot Springs and Wonderful Skiing

Andong's scenery is beautiful, and there are many special pleasures. "Wulongbei," which is located 40 miles northwest of Andong City on the Anshan-Andong line, is a large hot spring known as one of the three sisters along with "Tanggangzi" and "Xiongyuecheng" in southern Liaoning. It is said that Emperor Taizong of Tang once stationed and bathed here during his expedition to Goguryeo. In the past, the old "Manchurian Railway" operated it, and there were hotels such as Wulong Pavilion, Maintenance Hall, and Jule Pavilion, with comfortable facilities. In addition, there are private bathhouses such as Longquan Village and Shuiming Village. The spring water is colorless and transparent, with a daily output of 1,800 dan and a temperature of 70 degrees Celsius. It is very helpful for treating skin diseases, neuralgia, gastrointestinal diseases, anemia, etc. Fortunately, it was not destroyed by the Communist Army this time.

Tonghua is surrounded by mountains on all sides, and the amount of snow in winter is large and does not melt, making it a natural large ski resort. During the puppet regime, ski resorts such as Nanshan, Longquan, Jingshan, Huadianzi, and Yinchang were set up. In February 1943, the puppet regime also held a so-called "East Asia Skiing Competition" here. The ski resort has a large 45-meter jump platform and a practice field that can accommodate hundreds of people. Skiing men and women slide down the hillside from the top of the mountain, flying over highlands, valleys, rushing and jumping, forming a beautiful painting in a silver world.

### Inspection Notes on Chahar, Suiyuan: Inside and Outside the Great Wall (4)

— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Hang Zhou

Early Winter in Zhangjiakou

Without wind, the early winter in Zhangjiakou is still lovely. During our days in Zhangjiakou, the weather was said to be unusually good. Strolling on the smooth asphalt road, appreciating the swaying of the four legs of those behemoths from the desert - camels, and the strange movements of the humps, there is a rough poetic flavor. This is already Inner Mongolia, where Mongolians and Han people live together, and it is difficult to distinguish them. There are hundreds of Hui people here, adhering to their religious rules and rarely interacting with non-believers. They each make a living and have always lived in peace. There are hundreds of foreign religious people here, 90% of whom are White Russians who have now restored their Soviet nationality; in addition, there are people from Sweden, Norway, Belgium and other countries. The total population of Zhangjiakou, according to the latest survey, is 140,800 people.

Local order was restored within five days of the recovery. The 12th War Zone Headquarters has an organization called the "Provisional Political Affairs Committee," whose work is even more extensive and practical than the political department of the war zone. When Fu Zuoyi was appointed as the chairman of the Chahar Provincial Government, this committee was temporarily responsible for the administration of Chahar and Zhangjiakou before formally taking office. It operates simultaneously with the army, so there is no problem in the coordination of military and government affairs. Zhou Jun, the Secretary-General of the Provisional Political Affairs Committee, who once served as the Secretary-General of the Suiyuan Provincial Government, is currently serving as the acting mayor of Zhangjiakou and is said to be likely to be appointed as the Secretary-General of the Chahar Provincial Government. The Provisional Political Affairs Committee is a temporary organization, and it will end its work after the Chahar Provincial Government is organized.

Currently, among the work being carried out by the Provisional Political Affairs Committee, the handling of land issues is worthy of attention. The Provisional Political Affairs Committee formulates work guidelines based on the administration program of the pacification zone promulgated by the central government and with reference to the actual situation in the area. Among them, the methods for handling land issues are as follows:

1. Land handling committees shall be established in each county to investigate the current state of land, fairly handle land distribution and land rent disputes.
2. Landowners should submit land ownership certificates for land confiscated and liquidated by the Communist Party, and they shall be allowed to reclaim it without payment. If the land ownership certificate is lost, a written certificate from the Baojia head in charge and two neighboring landholders adjacent to the land shall be provided, and they shall be allowed to reclaim it without payment.
3. Cultivators who have obtained land distributed by the Communist Party shall continue to retain the right to use the land, but must pay rent to the landlord.
4. Landlords shall retain property rights, but must limit the number of mu according to regulations and implement a 25% rent reduction.
5. In order to implement the land policy of the Principle of People's Livelihood, the policy of "land to the tiller" should be gradually implemented. On the one hand, the number of mu of private land should be limited. On the other hand, the Farmers Bank should provide loans to farmers to purchase the land they need to cultivate.
6. Ownerless land shall be confiscated by the government. Land not owned by the landlord shall be temporarily kept by the government.
7. The government should centrally manage public land, ownerless land, and land exceeding the landlord's limit, or purchase it at a fixed price to be owned by the state or the public, and establish public farms, cooperative farms, or distribute it to returning officers and soldiers and the families of soldiers on expedition for cultivation.

In addition, the following provisional measures have been formulated for the handling of this year's harvested materials from land confiscated and distributed by the Communist Party in the recovered areas:

1. For land distributed by the Communist Party through liquidation, the property rights still belong to the original landlord, and the tenant retains the right to harvest, but must pay the original landlord 15% of the harvested materials or the equivalent in value.
2. The harvested materials from land confiscated by the Communist Party shall be handled in accordance with the following methods:

A. If the land confiscated by the Communist Party and cultivated by the Communist Party itself has a proven landlord, the original landlord shall be given 15% of the harvested materials or the equivalent in value, and the remainder shall go to the public.

B. If the land confiscated by the Communist Party is cultivated by farmers on behalf of the Communist Party, and there is a proven landlord, the tenant shall pay the original landlord 15% of the harvested materials or the equivalent in value, and the remainder shall go to the tenant.

C. If the land confiscated by the Communist Party has no landlord and is transferred to farmers for cultivation, the tenant shall pay 15% of the harvested materials or the equivalent in value to the public, and the remainder shall go to the tenant.

D. If the land confiscated by the Communist Party and cultivated by the Communist Party itself has no landlord, all the harvested materials shall go to the public.

These handling methods are fair and reasonable. As a result of the implementation, the expected disputes were resolved smoothly.

Due to the blockage of transportation, the post office has not yet delivered enough stamps. Sending letters in Zhangjiakou is like in the primitive way, with the recipient paying the postage. There are no market prices for gold and US dollars here. Among various commodities, cloth is the most expensive, and food is relatively cheap. As for the fur goods praised by people, and the delicious mushrooms, although the truly valuable ones have been plundered by the Communist Army, the merchants are hoarding the remaining goods, and a medium-quality fox fur coat has already been sold for 700,000 to 800,000 yuan.

### Burmese Overseas Chinese Returning Home

— Chen Shurong

Rangoon Dispatch, 15th

The rainy season in Burma is coming to an end. During these several months of rain, the Rangoon River's waters, due to the tidal waves of the sea, oscillate. In the morning light, they flow smoothly into the sea, and at sunset, they surge against the current. The riverside area has become an informal park. Overseas Chinese men and women often stroll and walk here, watching the rise and fall of the tides and admiring the grandeur of the warships anchored in the river's heart. However, the question weighing heavily on the minds of the Overseas Chinese is: When will sea routes reopen? When will families separated by the war be reunited? When will those who survived the fall of Rangoon, snatched from the jaws of the tiger, be able to travel around the beautiful Penang Island, the cultural stronghold of Singapore, and return to their ancestral homes in Guangzhou, Xiamen, and Fuzhou, to see their aging parents with graying hair and missing teeth? This yearning for family reunions is the common thread in the hearts of most Overseas Chinese. Finally, good news has arrived: the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) is sending ships to Rangoon to transport returning Overseas Chinese, and these ships will also carry Overseas Chinese back to their homeland.

On October 8th, the Consulate General in Rangoon announced to the newspapers that the "Fengqing" transport ship would arrive for the first time in September. This time, UNRRA is repatriating over 1,900 Overseas Chinese, including 180 from Meixian, 50 from Fujian, and over 1,670 from Guangdong. This news brought much excitement, but also endless sorrow to some women. One woman, knowing that her husband was returning with a "War of Resistance wife," was so stimulated that she couldn't sleep all night and poured out her inner pain in writing. She said: "The cruel and savage war demon not only destroyed peace on earth but also killed the pure love between husband and wife. Peace on earth has now been restored, but unfortunately, that pure love is dead and can never be revived! ... When a rumor becomes reality, or when a letter arrives, originally thought to be a notice of departure, but instead reports the fact of bigamy, how disappointed and painful is the side of the 'abandoned resentful wife'! ... Chinese women have not truly achieved equal status with men, so women suffer losses in nine out of ten cases. Divorce? How to survive! Remarriage? Men and women alike will condemn you for 'losing your virtue'! What a cruel shackle! Are the sisters across the country to let this heavy shackle bind them forever until the end of the earth? ... I will not weep bitterly, nor will I hide and sob. I will not commit suicide, nor will I shave my head and become a nun! Although I have no savings and still have two children to raise, I don't believe I can't be independent. I don't believe a woman will starve to death if she leaves her husband! ... When your husband leaves you, if you are a devout Buddhist, don't you often turn to the compassionate Guanyin, wholeheartedly taking refuge and bowing in worship, wishing your husband a speedy return and reunion? If you are a devout Christian, don't you often repent of your sins before the Lord, sincerely praying that your husband's love will remain unchanged? These are all superfluous things. I was a fool for a lifetime. Men are accustomed to oppressing women, thinking that 'what's done is done,' and the wife will eventually forgive. We cannot allow this kind of tyranny by men to continue. We must seek economic independence and establish equal status between the sexes."

On October 9th, the newspaper reported that the Fengqing ship would arrive in Rangoon at 2:00 PM. Before noon, both sides of Rangoon's Pier No. 5 were already filled with men, women, old, and young, gazing at the horizon for the ship's silhouette. Time passed second by second, and the hearts of those standing on the shore were filled with boundless anticipation. Finally, at 2:00 PM, the magnificent Fengqing ship arrived. With a long blast of the whistle, the crowd on the shore surged, and the returning Overseas Chinese were eager to disembark immediately. At this moment, Consul General Yin, Deputy Consul Liu, along with the heads of the British government's customs, health, welfare, and police departments, boarded a small motorboat to go to the large ship first. The hot sun shone on the glittering river, reflecting the joyful waves in people's hearts. After some brief negotiations, the returning Overseas Chinese, holding passports and documents, fathers carrying their little sisters, mothers dragging their little brothers, entered the massive customs inspection station in a single file. Although the returning Overseas Chinese looked tired due to the hardships of sea travel, they suddenly discovered relatives and friends while looking around, and immediately waved their hands wildly, greeting each other and exchanging wishes of safety. This was a reunion after a great disaster, how fortunate! At this time, the Consul General addressed the returning Overseas Chinese, warmly welcoming them to Rangoon and wishing them a peaceful life. As a result, the detailed registration of over a thousand people, including their names, addresses, past occupations, relationships, and future plans, could not be completed at once. To streamline the procedures, the returning Overseas Chinese were sent back to the cabins for the night. The next day was National Day, and they successfully returned to their homes or the meeting halls of their hometown associations, seeing the national flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth flying everywhere.

The photo attached to this article is from the cocktail party held at the Consulate General on National Day to entertain international guests, where they had a cordial conversation with UNRRA representative Collison. He generously gifted it, and we hereby express our gratitude.

Spring and Autumn

### Autumn Prose

— He Feng

Autumn may be the season of poetry, but it is indeed the season of prose.

You look up to the sky. The autumn sky is cloudless, with a pale blue canopy, but with a radiant sun in the center. The light shines on your body, not too hot, but warm and pleasant. The breeze blows, carrying the fragrance of wild mountain flowers. Don't you remember the boundless wilderness outside the city? Wouldn't you want to go there on a sunny holiday to breathe in some fresh air? Lying on the grass, softer than a sofa, looking at the mountains, flowing water, white clouds, and the golden, shimmering rice ears reflecting the intense sunlight, it seems they are shy! All lowered their heads together, not daring to look up. A gust of wind rushes over, and a surge of waves rises in the field, shimmering with gold, undulating all the way to the distant horizon. The unnamed wildflowers by your feet emit a faint fragrance, and in the distant sky, three or five birds soar. A long gaze also makes you appreciate the beauty of nature. The silence makes you quiet, and unknowingly reminds you of the past, thus consuming the entire afternoon. This is the greatest landscape painting, the most beautiful scenery. A few hours of appreciation will surely cleanse you of the vulgarity of the city and the fatigue of your body and mind. This is the autumn prose, the autumn field prose.

Perhaps you prefer mountains and forests to the wilderness. I know you are like the fiery maple forests in the autumn mountains. So you will venture far up the mountain, undeterred by difficulties. How strange! From a distance, it looks like a wildfire set by a wild child. The fire is really strong, the flames spreading everywhere, but the fire doesn't seem to spread. As you get closer, the fire is even stronger and redder, but everything is still fine. The small leaves, shaped like palms, are scattered by the wind, and even the ground is covered with a layer of fire. This is the maple forest—the autumn maple forest. Of course, everything around is quiet. You will also sit down quietly and think, then open your sketchbook and write down the white clouds in the sky and this magnificent fiery scene, or open your book and recite a refreshing poem, a beautiful piece of prose. If there are still streams on the mountain, taking advantage of the fact that the stream water has not yet dried up, you will definitely find it in the warm autumn. There, you will wash your feet, like a child, playing in the water, building a dam, or digging a small canal in the hard mountain soil. Echoing the surging sound of the water, you will sing a soaring and majestic song, looking around at the mountains, and feeling like a hero. This is the prose of the mountains.

Speaking of flowers! Autumn flowers are no less beautiful than spring flowers! Counting on your fingers, deep red peonies, pale red goosefoot, yellow mimosa... What must be mentioned in particular is the autumn chrysanthemum. Who among flower lovers would not love chrysanthemums? So proud, like a reclusive hermit; so pure and beautiful, like a lightly made-up beauty; so magical, one simply cannot count her types and colors; facing her, even vulgar people will receive elegant inspiration. Even the wild chrysanthemums in the mountains are lovely, like a group of stars in the sky, adorning a thin stem, with few green leaves to embellish it, swaying in the wind, fragrant. Then there are osmanthus flowers! That is also enough to make people linger. Quietly spreading such a noble fragrance, creating an atmosphere of prose, aren't the petite and elegant flowers also masterpieces among flowers? Although the flowers bloom and fade easily, a regrettable thing, that fragrance is enough to add color to autumn. As for the laurel wreath on the poet's head, the anecdotes that have been passed down, aren't they also a beautiful story among flowers? This is the prose of flowers.

The autumn night is so high, so refreshing, adorned with stars; the autumn moon is so bright, so clear, the Mid-Autumn Festival moon is especially round, and the sky is especially high; except for young, ignorant children, who would lightly abandon such a beautiful night scene, such a rare festival, and not wait until they have seen the moonlight before their eyelids are willing to be controlled by their nerves, reluctantly returning to their rooms to sleep. The autumn stars are also especially small, especially bright, so bright that they are lovable. As for the autumn white clouds, they cannot be compared to those of other seasons, stretching and curling in the sky, against the azure dome, changing every second. So fickle, truly indescribable by humans. Just blink, and it has changed! Before it was a white polar bear, now it is a snow-covered larch, wearing a white coat; perhaps in another blink, it will become a gallant white horse? All this is so mysterious. This is the prose of night and clouds.

Autumn rarely has rain, but once the northeast wind sweeps in, the climate suddenly turns cold, and fine autumn rain will flutter down. The rain is so fine, it's really like threads, long, seemingly broken but never really breaking, drifting diagonally. As soon as you go out, you will get wet. Once it rains, it will last for ten days or half a month, it seems there will never be a sunny day. This is the annoying autumn rain. If you are living in a foreign land, without relatives, won't your homesickness be awakened by it? If you are sick in another place, listening to this monotonous sound of wind and rain in the middle of the night, the candlelight flickering, as if ghosts are about to appear, won't you spontaneously feel desolate and lonely? Even during the day, looking at that gray, cloudy sky, who wouldn't be worried? All the frustrations and disappointments of a lifetime will come to mind all at once. There is no laughter in the autumn rain, but it brings a touch of sadness, like slightly astringent olives, but with endless memories. This is the prose of autumn rain.

Even the insects have to be pushed to autumn. On autumn nights, in the corners of walls and courtyards, groups of symphony orchestras begin to play. All the unknown musicians are each playing a peculiar melody - mostly sad, like the border region's Hujia - responding and harmonizing, never stopping due to fatigue, not willing to stop until dawn. This is the autumn sound, the prose of music.

Autumn symbolizes silence, solitude, everything is calm, coldly like an ancient Guangling San, with no trace of frenetic rhythm; just a faint, lonely thin net, allowing you to contemplate and appreciate it; just a painting, not a Hollywood Technicolor movie. Everything is quiet and stable, without frenzy, without magic, therefore there are no novels, few poems, but endless prose—autumn prose.

### Poetry and Reality

— Luo Binjia

The world is vast and rich, and life is even more extraordinarily changeable and complex, so there will never be a shortage of inspiration for doing things; however, poetry must be "impromptu poetry," that is to say, reality provides an endless stream of causes and materials for poetry. (Quoted from "Goethe's Conversations")

### Chrysanthemum Art

A Brief Discussion on Planting

The period for appreciating chrysanthemums is at most half a month, but the time for cultivating them has not been interrupted for a year. After understanding the difficulty of planting chrysanthemums, those who visit chrysanthemum exhibitions will surely have a richer interest in appreciating chrysanthemums.

The chrysanthemums loved by Tao Yuanming are far less magnificent and varied than what we see now. What is still called "Tao's Beloved Chrysanthemum" is an ancient species, a small flower with yellow, thin petals. This kind of wild chrysanthemum has gradually increased and changed through artificial cultivation.

In the late spring and early summer, break off chrysanthemum branches two or three inches long, insert them into the soil, and they will take root and grow in a week, blooming in autumn, larger than those that bloom from older branches. This is called cutting.

Grafting chrysanthemum branches onto another chrysanthemum plant or artemisia plant makes the flowers even larger. This is called grafting. Grafting can make a single plant bloom with thousands of flowers, or red, white, and yellow flowers all bloom on the same plant, becoming a strange bonsai.

However, the shape and color of the flowers that bloom from cuttings and grafts are exactly the same as the original flowers, except for being larger.

The novel chrysanthemum species seen recently are not natural but artificially produced, that is, two kinds of chrysanthemums are taken and cross-pollinated when they bloom, and then the ripe seeds are taken and sown to germinate. This is called seed breeding. The flowers that bloom from seed breeding are a mixture or compromise of the father and mother species, producing new patterns. The "Apricot Red Flag" planted by Mr. Yue Yuan, the owner of Huangyuan Garden (illustrated in (1)), is a beautiful example of a new species.

When cross-pollinating, it must be isolated from other flowers, placed in a flower room or by a glass window before flowering, and do not open the window to prevent wild flower pollen in the air from sneaking in (detailed in my book "Beijing Huh").

If the flowers of the father and mother species bloom at uneven heights, bricks must be used to raise them to the same height so that the two flowers face each other closely. After the flowers are dry, take the flat, thin seeds from the centers of the two flowers and sow them in the spring, and they will germinate and be divided into separate plants. Unfortunately, most of these new species are not successful, only about two or three out of a hundred pots, and a year of cultivation must be thorough and flawless. After the chrysanthemums wither, the seeds can all be collected, but the results are chaotic and more difficult to succeed than artificial cross-pollination.

In this exhibition, Mr. Liu Jinchao's Green Lotus (2) and Mr. Jin Xirong's Trusting Osmanthus (3) are both valuable; the Silver Needle (4) of the Municipal Public Works Bureau and the Yellow Plum (5) of the Xinhua Farm are also rare. However, exhibitors with single-stem styles are more likely to win.

### Yellow Flowers

— Shi Bei

Outside my window, weeds grow densely. A layer of white frost covered them in the morning, and the green color of the grass leaves has all disappeared, leaving only withered and yellow heads hanging low. These green lives are coming to an end; only the grass mound is, healthily standing a few yellow flowers, enduring frost and dew, breaking through the atmosphere of this lonely season. Even if it is a small yellow flower, what a stubborn life it is!

The sun slowly breaks through a thin layer of fog and shines down. The flowers bathed in the sunlight, revealing some golden colors; the frost marks on the flower leaves that have gradually digested also permeated with some warm airflow.

The yellow flowers of late autumn are not like the roses that bloom in early spring, those bright reds and purples, like a smile that stores melancholy, disappearing in an instant. Nor are they like the bright red pomegranates of summer, so intense and dazzling; the winter plums blooming on the snowy branches seem too cold and clear. Only these yellow flowers of autumn, like a kind old friend, remotely extend a warm and sincere hand to you. Seeing it, needless to say, we will be like a wanderer who has traveled through desolate grass paths and returned, willing to stop and linger by its side. It will not use light smiles and shallow frowns to seduce you, nor will it use skilled and provocative emotions to stir your heart. It calls you to think of the past, to be true to yourself, and to restrain the wildness of youth! Standing quietly opposite the yellow flowers, you will have more old feelings, you seem to be happy, yet you also seem to be sad.

Yellow flowers are also a symbol of loyalty. Have you ever had the experience of living in an ancient mountain city? Years of wind and sand have eroded the essence of the mountain city, the dilapidated city walls are full of decline and desolation, and even the stories of the martyrs who defended the city in the past have been pushed away by true legends. But seeing the annual yellow flowers on the city wall can lead your thoughts and create a close connection with this ancient city. You think: under the yellow flowers and yellow earth, how many white bones of martyrs have been buried, how many blood and tears of the people have been shed; the vicissitudes of history have been several disasters. The historical facts of these ancient fortresses are just like a city of dusk, and you want to open up a brand new world for it.

Or you let those wild yellow flowers grow together by a sparse fence. They are strong and bright. In the dim light of the setting sun, you and your shadow walk back and forth for a while. At this time, although you see fallen leaves drifting in the courtyard, or you encounter autumn wind and oblique rain, you still feel that the autumn scenery is lovely.

I sit in the room, looking at the sky outside the window, aren't these hardy flowers of late autumn "not ashamed of the pale autumn appearance of the old garden, but look at the fragrance of the hardy flowers of late autumn"? After all, autumn brings me some good news.

### Jialing River Miscellany

— Zang Zan

Purple Swallow

I heard that there is a kind of bird in the world called the Purple Swallow. It grows by the sea and specializes in fighting the waves. When they smell a big storm coming, they will fly up to meet it.

And migratory birds that follow the sun like sunflowers are also beautiful: during each migration, I don't know how many small birds or old birds fall into the sea. Even if they are fortunate enough to encounter a ship in the ocean, which can provide them with a place to rest or forage for food, it is said that few have the ability to fly again, so they become food for others, or still fall into the sea. Even if they fly up again, there is an endless desert after crossing the ocean... That journey is long and arduous.

Although the journey is so difficult, I have never heard of a swallow on anyone's beam being exempted from the pilgrimage-like trek in any year.

Oath

Who loves life more than a sick person? Because he lives on the edge of death.

Blue sky, white clouds, flowers, wind, sunshine, pedestrians outside the window... all make people nostalgic! Like never having touched or understood them before.

Now I know that all this is life!

All the past days have been wasted.

If I could get life again, how fully would I live in those days! I will never let a small amount of time or things slip by me.

### Appreciating Chrysanthemums

— Xu Shiqi

With the moistening grace of the three springs, the cool and clear autumn season,

Dew condenses without drifting dust, the sky is high and the scenery is clear. (Tao Qian's time)

For nine years, I have been locked in the high mountains and steep ridges, the rugged Shu Road, the swaying Zhan trees, and the quiet bamboo dwellings on the banks of the Jialing River. After a long time, the car returned to Jiangnan. It was the golden season of high autumn and refreshing air, when all the flowers bloom (European proverb). Poets and painters, facing this rich and varied color, and the splendid and gentle sunlight, have unlimited interest; the greatness of nature is that it can contribute this continuous creation to the comfort of the human soul!

I took some time out of my busy schedule to appreciate a chrysanthemum exhibition held by the city government in Fuxing Park. The five colors were gorgeous, and the flowers were gathered together. Among the fine varieties were "Ice Disk Holding Osmanthus," "Oriole Leaving the Valley," "Snow Ling Mountain," and "Golden Petal Lotus"; and the products of the Huangyuan Garden owner were the most skilled in winning the arena. I remember Lu You's verse about Bai Juyi: "The moon blossoms bloom late without peerless beauty, the wind is strong and often moves with strange fragrance, a little embellishment of this cool and clear season, washing away the disturbing worldly worries of the past few days."

### An Inch of Territory, An Inch of Blood 94

— Ye Jingfeng

"Put down your weapons... Charge!" The fellow recited the order like a lesson, one word at a time, slowly, with a very stern voice. Most Japanese were short, but this one was nearly six feet tall, and judging by his voice, I knew he was strong. The fact that he was alone, calmly scouting this area, showed his cunning. The fact that he was doing the search work alone showed his courage and that he must have exceptional skills and abilities.

Hearing his words, Tiger Brother and I had no choice but to drop our guns. Facing us were a submachine gun and this wolf-like Japanese soldier. Behind us were large amounts of gasoline and a lit fuse. We were in the restricted area of a secret Japanese lair, the so-called heart of the military. Furthermore, they had activated full security. There might be other searchers and dogs following behind him. All it would take was for him to give an alarm, and all the searchlights would focus on this spot. The whole team of men and dogs would rush here. Escaping would be harder than climbing to heaven!

"Fight it out?" But if Tiger Brother pulled out his second gun, regardless of whether he could hit the enemy quickly, the enemy would definitely fire. And as soon as he fired, the gasoline on the ground would ignite. In that half-second or less, the movement of an arm, was the moment of our death or the enemy's. That being said, I didn't think it was the right time for a final showdown. We needed quick wit, or a godsend opportunity.

"Little Aunt, what about the fire on the ground?" Tiger Brother asked me, while raising his hands as instructed, but stepping aside, as if deliberately letting the enemy see the fire on the ground.

"Shut up, I'll beat you... Charge!" the Japanese soldier roared.

Maybe this guy didn't see us start the fire? Maybe he didn't realize the ground was covered in gasoline? While roaring, he took two steps closer to us, his eyes searching for the fire on the ground. At the same time, he opened his nostrils and sniffed the gasoline covering the ground, as if appreciating the aroma of wine. Here, I must borrow a familiar phrase from old novels: "No sooner said than done!" In that split second when the guy was distracted by the fire—perhaps only a tenth of a second—Tiger Brother shouted, "Little Aunt, step aside!" He immediately performed a somersault, using his arm as a fulcrum, diving and rolling, covering more than ten feet of ground, arriving in front of the guy. The guy, seeing Tiger Brother's sudden move, was probably startled. Just as he was about to aim his gun, Tiger Brother, taking advantage of his rolling momentum, suddenly straightened his legs and jumped up, kicking the guy's left elbow. The submachine gun was jolted away, slipping from his left hand. In that instant, Tiger Brother swept his left hand outwards, sending the gun flying away.

"Hmm!" The famous Japanese nasal sound came out urgently. He probably forgot his Chinese in his urgency, and roared and howled, presumably cursing. As his "Hmm" hadn't even completely left his nostrils, Tiger Brother, agile as he was, had already jumped up (because the guy was a head taller than Tiger Brother), raised his left hand in a feint, lowered his body, and thrust his right hand upwards faster than lightning, stabbing into the guy's soft ribs, twisting and shaking. According to Tiger Brother's practiced grabbing techniques and yin-yang strikes, this guy, no matter how tall and strong, had already had some of his internal organs destroyed.

### Reply to Mr. Gold

— Shao Fu

It is not wrong for Americans to stand on the side of Americans; it is also not wrong for Chinese to stand on the side of Chinese. What is wrong is harming China from an American standpoint, or harming America from a Chinese standpoint. By harm, I mean harm to proper international relations and cooperation. You have worked in China for a long time, you know us well, which shows you have feelings for us; you are a journalist, and from the standpoint of colleagues, we are more easily understood. Therefore, we thank you for this letter expressing your opinion.

In the past year, the public and private relations between China and the United States have undeniably been less close than during the period of fighting side by side. There are naturally many reasons for this, but we always believe that many narrow-minded ideas, with selfish interests as a prerequisite, coupled with the rumors and exaggerations fueled by other schemers, have made this situation particularly serious and tense. This is something that you, Mr. Gold, who wish for the better, to eliminate many misunderstandings and promote genuine friendship between China and the United States, and I, who share the same wish and willingness to make the same efforts, feel very uneasy and very sorry about.

In this situation, we will feel the great responsibility of us journalists. We have an ancient Chinese saying: "Befriend the upright, befriend the forgiving, befriend the well-informed." Being upright, forgiving, and well-informed in our words and reports is actually a very good guideline. Secondly, regarding free expression and open discussion, I believe that if it goes beyond the scope of goodwill, the result will probably be difficult to "help improve everyone's feelings." Moreover, if what is expressed and discussed is entirely focused on unpleasant aspects, it would be unfair. I wonder if you agree with this?

As for the "current real problem" that you feel, I think Mr. Willkie's book "One World" can help you get an answer. Region, nationality, and race should not prevent humanity from working together to achieve humanity's ideals. And we, from the Great Harmony chapter of the Book of Rites to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People, have a consistent philosophical system that adheres to this ideal.

Youth Problem Information

### Sexual Adjustment

— Xu Rong

(Note: If one does not have a childish sense of mystery about sexual issues, and does not have a sense of "sex is a crime," then this article, which discusses practical sexual issues, should be a very serious piece of writing, and readers will surely be able to read it with an open and normal mind!)

Paul Popenoe, director of the American Institute of Family Relations, is an authority on contemporary male-female issues. He recently published a quite insightful discussion on "Sexual Adjustment," which is enough to serve as a compass for young people who are confused about the mystery of sex. He opposes the fallacy of "Trial Marriage," believing that sexual adjustment is not purely a physiological issue, but can be achieved with satisfactory results through mutual understanding and cooperation between the sexes.

A young female stenographer recently wrote a letter to Mr. Popenoe, saying that she had been very close to a young man for the past year and planned to marry him. However, he proposed to her with conditions. He said: The most important thing in marriage is satisfactory sexual adjustment. Therefore, he insisted on trying to find out before marriage whether they were sexually compatible. If they were, they would marry; otherwise, they should stop before it was too late to avoid tragedy. According to him, this was the most scientific approach. The female protagonist hoped that Mr. Popenoe would give her an answer. Below is Mr. Popenoe's opinion:

Most people generally hold erroneous views on sexual adjustment in marriage. They believe that sexual adjustment is predetermined. If it is compatible, then married life will naturally be satisfactory; otherwise, there is only the path of divorce. Their mistake lies in thinking that sexual adjustment is entirely determined by physiological conditions, which is not the case at all. Sexual incompatibility is really caused by psychological factors, while physiological defects are not particularly important.

The theory of so-called trial marriage completely ignores that in the beginning of any marriage, sexual adjustment is usually not satisfactory, due to nervous tension.

Mr. Popenoe once studied a thousand educated married women, and as many as two hundred and fifty of them said that they felt disgusted with their first sexual experience. The research results found that only 51 percent expressed satisfaction with their first experience, 40 percent expressed "tolerable," and the rest expressed pain.

It takes a considerable amount of time for wives to obtain complete satisfaction. Six hundred and fifty-eight women have reported on this experience. Twenty-five percent obtained satisfaction the first time, twenty-seven percent obtained satisfaction after several days or weeks, twenty-six percent obtained satisfaction after one month or eleven months, sixteen percent obtained satisfaction after one year or longer, and six percent never obtained satisfaction.

Generally speaking, sexual adjustment will naturally improve slowly under favorable psychological and social conditions. These conditions include feelings of mutual trust, a sense of permanent security, and freedom from terror.

Obviously, sexual adjustment can be strived for and is not predetermined. Therefore, trial marriage is not suitable for reality and is bound to encounter many difficulties. For example, young people often read some books about sex, most of which are vulgar books that describe a fantasy of satisfactory sexual life. When they find that the trial does not meet their ideals, they think that both parties are incompatible.

Excessive worry and excessive tension are the greatest enemies of sexual adjustment. Before holding a trial marriage, both men and women will inevitably feel worried and excessively tense, so the result will never be satisfactory. Moreover, there are many other difficulties: unfavorable environment, haste, keeping secrets, fear of being discovered, fear of pregnancy, the woman's fear that the man will abandon her later, fear that the other party will play with her and not prepare to marry her, and the man can easily judge that both parties are not sexually compatible.

The result is: cultivating a serious sense of inferiority. The man overemphasizes the results of the trial, thinking that he cannot adapt to normal standards. However, in reality, there is nothing abnormal about him. Both parties easily find fault with each other and are emotional. Even if they get married in the future, there will be no happy results.

So, how can one obtain satisfactory sexual adjustment in marriage? They must have normal emotions and attitudes. They must have sufficient sexual knowledge and mutual understanding. For this reason, they must receive realistic and scientific sex education, and should not read the fantasy stories written by sickly novelists. They must have permanent psychological preparation, and they must realize that married life is aimed at "growing old together in harmony." With such a healthy attitude and psychology, they don't have to worry about sexual adjustment problems.

### National ID Card Difficult to Obtain

— Chi Mo

It's a joke, really. The households in my building all registered at the same time, but some of the National ID card application forms that were sent out were complete, and some were not. Is it possible that the current Baojia system is not as sound as it was during the enemy and puppet regime?

Our first Jia's Jia head is not like other Jia heads. He is a "bourgeois." He doesn't want to be "ostentatious," so there is no sign for the Jia head's office at his door. Anyway, people always have to go to his office to beg him. The Jia head's residence is a modern Western-style house with sturdy bronze doors that are always closed.

There is an electric bell on the wall of this elaborate door. We boldly pressed it. After a while, a small window suddenly opened in the door. A drunken-looking policeman appeared, his face flushed and his eyes bloodshot. He spoke in a "stone hard" Shanghai dialect, "Why are you ringing the bell?" After we told him our purpose, he put on a stern face and said, "You're so inconsiderate, it's lunchtime, don't bother me. Come back later." Bang! The small door slammed shut. It was already 2:30 pm, and the police officer was still having lunch with his wife. It was our fault for going too early, damn it.

We went again at 4 o'clock. This police officer looked us up and down, still not comfortable opening the big door. He interrogated us in great detail. He saw the "badge" on my lapel. He ordered me to take it off. He took it and admired it for a full ten minutes, like an archaeologist studying antiques, before opening the door and letting us in.

The Jia head said that the application forms were not enough because the above-level department didn't send enough, so they were being distributed according to party affiliation. Those who didn't get them would be supplemented later. There was nothing he could do about it. The Jia head took the forms, stretched out his hands, shook his head, and exhaled heavily through his nostrils, as if sighing slightly.

### Plagiarism Trend

— Sheng Jie

No one, ancient or modern, Chinese or foreign, is born knowing how to write an article. It is not surprising that later generations quote the articles of previous generations and refer to the skills of previous generations, but that does not mean that copying other people's articles is a matter of course. Copying other people's articles without thinking and submitting them is tantamount to fraudulently obtaining property.

However, recently many contributors cannot change their bad habits. On the 13th, a certain newspaper in the local area published two articles: "Sun Liren Who Established Miraculous Achievements" and "Wang Yaowu Who Sits in Jinan." After reading them, the author felt very strange, because I had also written these two articles. The "Sun Liren" article was published by the author in Shenbao's Free Talk on September 30, 1946. When the newspaper published it, it omitted a section from "then entered West Point Military Academy to study" to "dare not be casual," and the rest of the original text was exactly the same as what the author wrote. As for the "Wang Yaowu" article, it was published by the author in Free Talk this year on Double Ten Day. The full text published by the newspaper was exactly the same as what the author wrote. I think this method of copying is too stupid!

I don't admit that my articles are well written, but I don't want them to be stolen, and I hate the trend of stealing articles. Therefore, I reveal the above, hoping that the editors of various newspapers will be careful of literary swindlers!

Story of a Psychoanalyst

### The Innocent Murderer 4

— Xu Guiting

"To be honest, I knew myself that the injury to my leg was not very serious. But because I was afraid they would discover that I could still jump around, I pretended to be completely crippled, lying on the ground without moving. Later, the opportunity came. One night, I exhausted all my strength to loosen the wooden stake, and then pulled it out to use it as a supporting stick. At that time, I saw a Japanese soldier outside the door taking off his helmet and resting. In an instant, I jumped two or three steps and landed behind the guy, using all my strength to smash the wooden stake on his head. At that time, because I used too much force, the wooden stake rebounded like a spring and flew out of my hand. And that Japanese soldier went to heaven like that. I laughed heartily, and then fumbled around until I found a group of Burmese people. Coincidentally, they were either pro-British or anti-Japanese, so with their help, I survived like this."

After finishing his story, Lu Xun looked at his watch and said, "It's almost five o'clock. Did I talk too much? Are you getting impatient?"

"Good heavens! Not at all," Mien replied. "However, I think you've told me enough this time. Let's end this conversation."

The next time, Lu Xun not only arrived on time but also earlier than usual at Mien's clinic. Mien, who was suffering from a headache, smiled at Lu Xun and said, "Do you feel better?"

"Better? I feel completely different than before. Your injections really work like magic."

"Of course," Mien said. "You used to have many things bottled up in your chest. Now that some of them have been cleared away, you naturally feel much more relaxed. So, let's continue talking."

Hearing this, the smile on Lu Xun's face completely disappeared. He asked blankly, "Continue?"

"Yes, we still have to clear away the rest of the things that are bottled up in your heart before we can stop. Now let's begin."

"But, begin what?" Lu Xun smiled, feeling quite confused. "I feel like I've completely recovered."

"I dare not make a judgment yet," Mien said calmly. "You seem much better. But I don't dare say to what extent. Let me investigate further."

Lu Xun immediately blushed and said awkwardly, "I thought psychoanalysts also needed to eat."

Mien frowned slightly, without answering anything.

Lu Xun suddenly became furious and said coldly, "Okay! I want to warn you, I don't have a single penny, and I can't continue to bother you like this. I feel very good, so there's no need to continue with those unnecessary tests."

Mien replied softly, "The purpose of your coming here today is to persuade me to believe that you have been cured. When I say that I still can't make a judgment, you immediately start arguing with me. You want me to lose my temper so that you can leave. To be honest, you clearly still have many unspeakable things in your heart. These things are the source of your troubles. They are still there, plaguing you, constantly clinging to you, not allowing you to get rid of them, right?" (To be continued)

### Weekend Chat

Two Kinds of Food

According to news from Yinqu, Shanxi, "the abundance of drugs and the extreme shortage of textbooks in Taiyuan City are inversely proportional." It is said that during the occupation, the atmosphere of poison was everywhere. After the victory, many of those returning to their former posts resumed their bad habits. Recently, because smoking opium is tedious and time-consuming, most have switched to inhaling white powder. Because the supply and demand meet, those who traffic drugs continuously transport them from Pingjin and other places. But on the other hand, middle school textbooks and reference books in various counties and cities in Shanxi Province cannot be transported due to traffic congestion, and students are extremely depressed, so their attitude toward education is extremely low. Bringing these two things together is very worrying. White powder is produced in the Pingjin area, and books should also be supplied by Pingjin; white powder can pass through customs and be transported safely, so that the market does not lack it, while books cannot meet students because of "traffic congestion." Don't think that students are of low level, they may sometimes become smart. If, in their depression, they feel that eating and doing nothing all day is too unfair to their parents, and the transportation of white powder is not difficult, they will be happy to join the ranks of trafficking. It could be a business for them to make a lot of money. Then teachers will also be jealous and rush to catch up, and teachers and students will cooperate. What will become of us then?

Fortunately, It Didn't Come True

Recently, a very interesting news story happened in Sichuan: a female teacher's clock in a distant bedroom of the Qu County Girls' Middle School was stolen, and it could not be found anywhere. So she sought the help of a fortune teller. The fortune teller calculated and told her that it was in the school's pond. The female teacher then ordered all the workers in the school to go into the water to look for it, but still found nothing, and was very angry, guessing and suspecting. This made all the male and female workers in the school panic. So everyone gathered in an open space, burned candles, swore oaths, and declared their innocence, and the situation became very serious. Looking at the way it was, this female teacher was probably studying psychology. Not wanting to lose her beloved object, she of course sought the help of divination, and then sought the help of swearing oaths; but unfortunately, the result seemed to have no harvest from her clinical experiment in psychology, but only caused a "situation of peace to become serious." But we really broke out in a cold sweat for the education in Sichuan Province, because if the lost item had really been found in the pond after a divination, or if any clues had been found after an oath, then the female students would have silently kept it in mind. In the future, when they were raising children, they would draw inferences from one case. The astrology and candle industries in Qu County would all be eagerly waiting and shouting that their cause was not isolated!

For Money

Two news stories this week can be combined as a basis for tea talks: One is that there is a person named Chen Guangqi in Xinhai County, Hebei. During the Anti-Japanese War, he joined the army and fought in various places. His wife, Ms. Liu, did not know in what year she and his younger brother got together and lived together. When the hero returned in triumph this year, he was furious and staged a full-scale martial arts fight, resulting in deaths and injuries on both sides. The other is that there is a person named Tang Chaoji in Xinhui County, Hunan, whose family is wealthy. Although there are several brothers, they have repeatedly tried to dominate the family property. Recently, Tang asked his sister-in-law and brother's wife to divide the grain rent, and was immediately angered, using an ax to chop his sister-in-law, brother, nephew and niece, four people. Afterwards, knowing that he could not avoid punishment, he also castrated himself with a razor and died. In the former case, the discord among relatives was caused by the fact that Ms. Liu had no means of support after her husband left; in the latter case, the disaster arose from the fact that Tang wanted to get as much money as possible. In short, both were forced by life and prices. At present, such facts are probably happening at all times and in all places. Even if there are feelings, they are trivial and not worthy of high discussion, so I will temporarily create the title above, just as a cry!
