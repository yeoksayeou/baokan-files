(1) U.S. Special Envoy Marshall can participate in the three-person committee to determine the procedures for ceasing conflict and restoring railway transportation. (2) An immediate cessation of conflict throughout the country, especially in Rehe Province. (3) The restoration of transportation should include land, sea, air, and postal and telecommunications, and finally, the lifting of the blockade around the CCP-controlled areas.

Hopes for Peace; Not to be Overly Optimistic

[Another Dispatch] Although the CCP has replied to the government's proposal, hopes for peace do not seem very bright, and there is still anxiety here. Minister of Information Wu Guozhen stated: Some points listed in the CCP's answer, such as the request to lift the so-called blockade of the liberated areas, need to be clarified. The CCP spokesperson stated: Lifting the blockade means that any central troops hindering traffic in the liberated areas should be withdrawn and the central army defenses around the liberated areas should be destroyed.

### National Army Advances Towards Chengde; Enters Rehe to Accept Surrender; Communist Armies in Shandong and Shanxi Continue to Disrupt Railway Transportation

[United Press, Chongqing, 4th] According to official sources, one Chinese liaison officer is scheduled to go to Shenyang today to discuss the takeover of Shenyang with the Soviet authorities.

[United Press, Chongqing, 4th] Central News Agency reported today: General Du Yuming's rapid advance troops have already arrived at Xinmin, 35 miles west of Shenyang, four miles west of the city, and have agreed with the Soviet side on the peaceful takeover of Xinmin. At the same time, the Communist armies in Shandong and Shanxi provinces continue to disrupt railway transportation, with the Jinan-Qingdao Railway and the Datong-Puzhou Railway damaged again. In the second half of December, there were multiple landmine explosions in the two provinces.

(Another Dispatch) Today, civil war is still ongoing in the two major areas of North China and many minor areas. There are large-scale battles in eastern Rehe Province, with government troops penetrating deep into Rehe Province from their Jinzhou base, advancing towards the provincial capital, Chengde. Communist Party sources claim that the National Army has occupied Chaoyang, an important railway city 140 miles east of Chengde. Government spokespersons deny this, stating that as of today, Chongqing has not received this news. The second most important war zone is the Lincheng area in southern Shandong. According to Minister of Information Wu Guozhen, as of today, the Communist army is still advancing. In addition, government sources also stated that the Communist army is currently attacking many other cities in Shandong Province, including Qufu, the hometown of Confucius, north of Lincheng. The Communist army is also attacking Gaoyou in northern Jiangsu. The government's explanation for its actions in Rehe is that there were no Communist troops in Rehe before the Japanese surrender, and the Allied countries agreed that the National Army would take over the area. Government sources stated: "In terms of legal and factual circumstances, the government's actions in Rehe are fully justified and are not a civil war."

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 4th] It is reported that the Communist army is still frequently engaging in the destruction of highway transportation in various places. Between Guihua and Wuchuan, as many as fourteen bridges on the highway have been destroyed by the Communist army.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] It is reported that a village five kilometers northwest of Taixian was set on fire by the Communist army a few days ago. When the villagers tried to put out the fire, they were attacked, and the entire village was burned down.

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 3rd] The commander of the First Battalion of the Xinjiang People's Liberation Team under the Taiyue Military Region of the Communist Army is Gao Haizha, and the commander of the Second Battalion is Li Guotai. Each unit, with more than a hundred people, is causing disturbances in Quwo and Xinjiang, plotting to expand the so-called liberated areas. In addition, thirty-six organizations in Shanxi Province issued a telegram denouncing the atrocities of the Communist army, stating that 50,000 people in Shanxi have died due to the Communist army's instigation of chaos, and the loss of houses and materials amounts to tens of billions.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 3rd] The Hebei Provincial Reconstruction Promotion Association's Beiping branch, in view of the Communist Party's division and occupation, destruction of unity, obstruction of the surrender process, and harm to the people's lives, recently sent a telegram to the National Political Council, appealing for the nationalization of the army and the democratization of politics. In addition, the fellow villagers associations of various counties in Hebei Province recently sent a telegram to the Central Government and the National Political Council, vowing to uphold national unity with the public opinion of 30 million people, earnestly hoping that the Communist Party will lay down its butcher knife, be compassionate, hand over military power to the government, and return political power to the people.

### Friend of China During the War of Resistance; Flying Tigers Leader Returns to China Again; Chongqing Preparing a Hero's Welcome Ceremony

[United Press, Chongqing, 4th] Chongqing is preparing a hero's welcome ceremony today to welcome former Commander of the U.S. Fourteenth Air Force in China, Major General Chennault. General Chennault flew from San Francisco on Wednesday and will take a position in China in civilian aviation or the air force. The famous "Flying Tigers" he previously led in China controlled a vast area between Taiwan and Northeast China, penetrating deep into Japanese airspace. Government officials and military circles have not disclosed Chennault's position in China. According to reports from New York by our agency, members of the Fourteenth Air Force believe that the leader of the "Flying Tigers" will undoubtedly train young air force personnel in China as a civilian. It is believed here that Chennault requested that news of his trip not be publicized before his departure from San Francisco, so the issue of Chennault's position will definitely be announced by himself, as the Chinese authorities respect his request. His "Flying Tigers" shot down many Japanese planes in Chinese airspace and regained vast safe areas for the Chinese army in the early stages of the war. His task was obviously not easy. At that time, the number of aircraft was insufficient, supplies were scarce, and air transport from India to China was lacking. Great planning was needed to transport bulky supplies from the United States to usable areas in China, taking 75 to 90 days. The supply line was arguably the longest in the world, totaling 16,000 miles. In April 1943, after a long period of preparation, the U.S. Air Force began operations in southeastern China. In March of that year, the Fourteenth Air Force, commanded by General Chennault, established the U.S. Air Force in China as an individual unit. Shortly before its first attack, the Japanese Air Force resumed its offensive, and the Japanese Marines landed in Guangzhou Bay in the French Concession on the Leizhou Peninsula, building an airfield to confront the Allied forces. One month after the first U.S. Air Force attack, the Fourteenth Air Force severely attacked Hainan Island, occupied by the Japanese army, and the Hanoi-Haiphong area in northern Vietnam. In May of that year, the Japanese army launched a general offensive with five divisions against Yichang, Changde, and Chongqing, but ultimately failed. Chinese and American air force personnel shot down 31 Japanese planes over Yichang. The offensive of the Chinese and American air forces was reaching its climax at this time. On Thanksgiving Day in 1943, the Chinese-American mixed air force bombed a certain airfield in Taiwan, destroying many Japanese planes, and the entire team returned to base safely. One year later, Chinese skies were filled with "Flying Tigers" on liberated bombers, and its achievements are now evident to all.

[Central News Agency, City Report] U.S. military headquarters reported yesterday that U.S. troops in China currently account for 13.4% of all U.S. troops, a substantial decrease, as they accounted for 32.1% of the total last October. [United Press, Tianjin, 3rd] The Marine Corps headquarters here announced today that the transfer of senior officers and soldiers of the U.S. Marine Corps has been accelerated comprehensively. According to official announcements, 5,000 officers and soldiers will return to the United States aboard the luxury cruise ship "General R. L. Howze", which is about to arrive in China. The cruise ship will carry the same number of redeploying personnel. At the same time, the repatriation of Japanese soldiers and civilians, which had been suspended for a short period, has also resumed. During this short period of hiatus, the U.S. side sent tank landing craft to Shanghai to assist in the repatriation. Today, due to strong winds blowing through Tanggu Port, the train departing from Tianjin was forced to return, so the repatriation work was temporarily suspended. Three thousand six hundred soldiers and one hundred officers of the First Marine Division and the Third Amphibious Force will return to the country aboard the "General R. L. Howze" cruise ship. It is expected that they will board the ship at Tanggu around January 10. The ship will stop briefly in Qingdao to pick up a portion of the officers of the Sixth Division and then return directly to Sandy Hook, California, with an estimated arrival date of January 31.

### Intricacies of the Northeast; "Chinese Communist Army" and "Joint Communist Army"

[United Press, Chongqing, 3rd] Mr. Zhou Jingwen told reporters today that the situation in the Northeast is complex. The Communist army in southern Northeast China is under the command of Yan'an, while the Communist army north of Changchun is under the command of the Russian side. The former is called the "Chinese Communist Army," and the latter is called the "Joint Communist Army." The "Joint Communist Army" underwent years of training before the Russian army entered the Northeast and entered the Northeast simultaneously with the Red Army in August. This army is composed of the former Anti-Japanese Chinese Volunteer Army, which was expelled by the Japanese, and pro-Russian Koreans and Mongolians, who have been standing by in Siberia for several years. Before and after the occupation of the Northeast by the military, they served as the best fifth column, totaling about 100,000 people. The number of the "Chinese Communist Army" is about the same. Mr. Zhou concluded by saying that the Russian army has set up a joint minefield line along the Changchun Railway.

### Military Service System Ten-Year Plan

Abolition of Military District Divisions

[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 4th] Regarding the military service system, the central government hopes to lay a sound foundation in the near future. It is reported that the Military Service Department has drafted a ten-year plan and submitted it to the authorities for review. When the new plan is implemented in the future, the existing military districts and divisional districts will be abolished, and they will be replaced by a military region system under the unified planning of the Military Service Department. Detailed measures will be announced after approval.

### Completing Two Major Tasks in Beiping; President Song Arrives in Tianjin for Inspection; Promoting Economic Reconstruction and Developing Trade

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 3rd] President Song has already completed most of his work in Beiping and will go to Tianjin tomorrow. The Dagukou New Port and several large yarn factories there will be his main targets of inspection. During his week in Beiping, President Song accomplished two major tasks: the postal and telecommunications price increase was temporarily suspended. If the price was implemented uniformly across the country, the people of North China would have to pay 20 yuan to send a letter instead of two yuan, and news reporters sending urgent telegrams to Shanghai would go from 8 jiao per word to 2 yuan. Once implemented, the impact on prices would be unimaginable. He established an office of the Executive Yuan with the highest authority to resolve unreasonable phenomena during the takeover process. Only one seal is allowed to be affixed to a large door, and this seal should be quickly removed to allow the machinery inside to start running. The principle of resuming work has been largely determined. Factories of the same nature will be merged together. For example, there cannot be two institutions for textiles in Tianjin or for iron production in Beiping. Some small factories will be opened to welcome private capital participation. The funds required for the resumption of work in various factories can be approved by the government for loans from banks. Most factories can be fully restored within three months. Conditions in more complicated factories will be delayed for more than four months. The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant is the most valuable industrial asset left by the enemy in North China, but it relies on raw materials from the Longyan Iron Mine, which is controlled by the Communist army, making it impossible to resume work at present.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 3rd] President Song stated in Beiping that the government will take effective measures to stabilize prices and that this year's budget will be balanced to avoid increasing the issuance of currency as much as possible. Regarding enemy-puppet-operated enterprises, the government will continue to make every effort to complete those that are truly of continued value, such as the Dagukou New Port. This statement was made by Mr. Song at a banquet for councilors yesterday afternoon. Cheng Shewo strongly argued during the meeting that the country should attach importance to North China, and said that if it could be attached importance to even if the capital was not located in Beiping after the Northern Expedition, the history before and after the September 18th Incident would have been different. Xiao Yishan also said that the Ming Dynasty would not have lasted for two hundred years if it had not moved the capital to Beiping. Song expressed the same feeling about the importance of Beiping.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 4th] President Song flew from Beiping to Tianjin at 11:00 AM on the 4th, accompanied by Sun Yueqi, director of the Beiping-Tianjin District Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau, and Liu Zongyi, director of the Hebei Salt Affairs Administration.

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 4th] President Song is scheduled to stay in Tianjin for three days and will receive central and local officials at his official residence. He will hold a meeting in the afternoon to give instructions on the takeover of enemy-puppet property and handling measures. Zhang Yan'e, Du Jianshi, Tan Boyu, Sun Yueqi, He Weiye, and others participated. A dinner was held in the evening for U.S. military commander Locky and Chief of Staff Walton. [Central News Agency, Tianjin, 4th] President Song issued a written statement to reporters in Tianjin as follows:

"Tianjin is the economic center of northern China, and its foreign trade also occupies an important position. When the Dagukou New Port is completed in the future, its importance will be further increased. This visit is to inspect and promote economic reconstruction and the handling of the takeover of enemy and puppet property and other matters. I will stay for three or two days, because it has been difficult for a long time, and there are many matters to be dealt with, so I must return quickly."

### Zhou Yichun to Fly to Beiping

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 4th] Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Zhou Yichun will fly from Chongqing to Beiping soon to personally handle the takeover of agricultural agencies. Mr. Zhou's arrival is at the behest of President Song. After arriving in Beiping, Mr. Song learned that the enemy's agricultural agencies in North China were large, complete, and successful, and could not be taken over and handled by the special commissioner's office, which was lacking in manpower and financial resources. Therefore, he telegraphed Mr. Zhou to come. It is reported that the North China Agricultural Experiment Station, the main agricultural institution in North China, is the largest in East Asia, with its branch stations spread throughout North China. It has made great contributions to the enemy's production increase work over the years. The main station in the western suburbs of Beiping originally had 500 employees. After the takeover, only 30 Japanese experts were retained due to lack of funds.

### Selling Flour at Parity Prices

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 3rd] Director of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, Tong Guanxian, said that 6,000 tons of relief flour have arrived in Beiping and more than a dozen auction houses will be set up to sell it in bulk at prices 5% lower than market prices. All auctioneers will be poor students on winter vacation. It is generally believed that this is President Song's first important measure to stabilize prices. Mr. Tong will accompany President Song to Tianjin for inspection tomorrow.

### Zhang and Lu, Two Envoys, Meet with Representatives from All Walks of Life in Tianjin

Mr. Zhang and Mr. Lu also announced that they would convey the hardships of the people to the central government. Representatives from all walks of life stood up to speak, all stating the suffering under the oppression of the enemy and puppets in the past. Members of the education sector mentioned eight years of suffering and shed tears. Their hopes for the present are nothing more than subsidizing private schools, giving preferential treatment to teachers and staff, restoring production in factories, and providing relief to unemployed workers.

### Two Banks and Bureaus Send Personnel to Qingdao to Handle the Takeover of Enemy and Puppet Financial Institutions

[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 4th] The Four Banks and Two Bureaus have all sent personnel to Qingdao to prepare for the establishment of branch banks and bureaus. The Central Bank, the Bank of China, the China Trust Bureau, and the Postal Remittances Bureau officially opened for business today. All enemy and puppet financial institutions in Qingdao are monitored by personnel dispatched by the Central Bank. The vault has been sealed off, but the Zhengjin is handled by the Bank of China. All enemy and puppet banks and associations will be closed from today. Regarding the clearing of counterfeit (United Reserve Bank) notes circulating in the market, the Central Bank will begin collection and exchange on the 7th and plans to restore remittances with various places. Since Qingdao's takeover, the exchange between counterfeit money and legal tender has been extremely chaotic. At the beginning of October, one yuan of legal tender was exchanged for seven or eight yuan of counterfeit money. Since the municipal government issued a notice on the legal price of one to five, the black market soared to three yuan and five jiao. In November, the legal tender rose, and by December, it had risen to one yuan of legal tender for seven yuan of counterfeit money. Due to financial stringency, industry and commerce were extremely sluggish. Now that the various banks and bureaus have resumed business, they should be able to recover.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] Chen Yaodong talked about the clearing and restoration of banks and money shops in Nanjing: (1) There are more than 160 commercial banks and money shops that have closed down in this city. Most of them have now completed the clearing within the three-month deadline in accordance with regulations. Only a few banks and shops still need to correct the procedures and report the method of handling the remaining assets and the share value of the shareholders who aided the enemy. (2) The restoration of the banks is very smooth. The banks that have resumed business in addition to the Four Banks and Two Bureaus are Jiangsu Second Bank, Jiangsu Farmers Bank, New China Trust and Savings Bank, Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank, and Nanjing Commercial and Savings Bank. There are seven banks that are preparing to resume business: China General Chamber of Commerce, China South, Guohua, Zhongfu, Juxingcheng, China Industrial, and Siming. (3) Regarding the resumption of business of the money shops established before the war, the Nanjing Municipal Chamber of Commerce Political Election Preparatory Committee requested that the restoration methods of commercial banks be applied and that they be restored to business as early as possible. The matter is being requested for instructions. (4) There were eight former enemy and puppet banks in Nanjing: Central Reserve Bank, Xingye, Taiwan, Korea, Shanghai, Japan, Hankou, and the puppet Bank of China. All of them have been taken over separately. (5) The situation of exchanging counterfeit money in this city is quite good. From October 1 to December, the various banks and bureaus in the city have collected and exchanged counterfeit money totaling more than 120 billion yuan, equivalent to more than 600 million yuan in legal tender.

### MacArthur Issues Another Order for Japan; Orders Elimination of Warmongers; So That New Leaders Can Emerge in Politics Who Value the Present and Do Not Yearn for the Past; Cabinet Calls Emergency Meeting This Morning

[United Press, Tokyo, 4th] Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers MacArthur today issued two orders, ordering the Japanese government to eliminate all ultra-nationalist terrorist parties, militarist groups, or any societies that have deceived and lured the Japanese people into a plan to conquer the world. This order from MacArthur is a further step than previous orders, aiming to implement the requirements of the Potsdam Declaration, that Japan should break away from the shackles of irresponsible warlords, as a price for peace. This order aims to liberate the newly established political parties and the government itself from the warlords and feudal forces, and to ensure that government officials are no longer threatened by secret organizations and terrorist worker attacks. MacArthur ordered the cancellation of 27 parties and associations, most of which held political power. These include the Greater Japan Innovation Association, the Greater East Asia Association, the Black Dragon Society, the Black Ocean Society, the East Asia League, and various other youth organizations. MacArthur's directive also prohibits the organization of any political party or society that seeks to resist or oppose the occupying forces, or support the Japanese warlords' external aggression, exclude foreigners from operating industries and businesses in Japan, promote military or paramilitary training, or advocate other ultra-nationalist plans. The assets of the disbanded organizations will be confiscated and managed by the Japanese government, and all archives and records will be confiscated and published. All members since July 7, 1937, should be transferred to the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers. The Shidehara cabinet will hold an emergency meeting at 10:00 AM tomorrow to discuss MacArthur's stringent order to purge pro-war elements in the Japanese government. It is not yet clear whether MacArthur's new policy will cause the downfall of the Japanese cabinet; however, it is expected that five cabinet members will be dismissed in accordance with the order. Tokyo newspapers interpret MacArthur's order as giving Japan the opportunity to produce new leaders.

Nurturing the Democratic Tendencies of the Japanese People; Reviving and Strengthening Them

[United Press, Tokyo, 4th] MacArthur declared in today's order: "If Japan wishes to establish a responsible government securely, then the appointment of new officials must be done with the utmost caution. These officials should nurture the democratic tendencies of the Japanese people, revive and strengthen them, and respect fundamental human rights and freedom of speech, religion, and thought." The number of people affected by this directive is not yet clear, but it is estimated to be in the hundreds. From special agents to cabinet members, officials of the Ministry of Home Affairs, and members of the House of Peers, all those stipulated in the directive are included. Not only will those in charge be dismissed, but parliamentary candidates covered by the directive will lose their eligibility for candidacy, and prefectural governors or mayors will also be dismissed. According to the new directive, a large number of war criminals will be generated, including personnel from the General Staff Headquarters, the Supreme Command Headquarters, and other military agencies, as well as officials from financial and colonial companies. A total of 20 colonial companies, including the South Manchuria Railway Company, the South Manchuria Development Company, the North China Development Company, the Central China Development Company, and the Joseon Trust Company, are included, and their officials are included in the list of war criminals, so as to align actions with the military governments of Korea, Taiwan, Kanto, Nanyang, Dutch East Indies, Malaya, French Indochina, Burma, China, and Manchuria.

Head of the General Headquarters Discusses MacArthur's Order; Decided Before the Moscow Conference

[United Press, Tokyo, 4th] Deputy Chief of Staff of the Allied General Headquarters, Major General Whitney, stated that MacArthur's order to purge Japanese militarists was not the result of a new control plan for Japan. This directive was being drafted eight weeks before the Moscow Conference decided to establish the Control Commission and the Far Eastern Commission. The individuals involved in today's announcement are one of the fundamental problems we encountered at the beginning of the occupation. According to the Hochi Shimbun, MacArthur issued this order because the Japanese cabinet did not act on its own initiative, which was inevitable. In principle, the Japanese cabinet should have acted on its own initiative, and the Emperor should have paid attention to the issue of new national leaders, and taken remedial measures before the government was prompted by the Allied Commander-in-Chief. Shidehara was absent from today's cabinet meeting due to a cold. It is reported that the directive arrived late and had not been translated for discussion, so the meeting only discussed the new budget.

### Koreans Oppose Trusteeship System; Held Demonstration Yesterday; More Than 100,000 Participants

(United Press, Seoul, 4th) Korean leaders advocating the independence movement and opposing the supervision plan. Tens of thousands of people, braving the winter cold, held a mass meeting and parade, chanting slogans in support of the left-wing "People's Republic." Their leaders continue to hold secret meetings with leaders of the provisional government. Speakers at the mass rally criticized the nation-building faction, saying that they misled the people in the weekend demonstrations. The demonstration was hosted by the two major left-wing parties, the People's Party and the Communist Party. According to the military police estimate, despite the bad weather, the number of participants was still over 100,000.

[Associated Press, Seoul, 4th] The Korean People's Republic held a parade to support the Moscow Conference's decision to establish a US-Soviet joint committee to investigate the domestic situation and establish a provisional government, showing that the party is the most stable political group in Korea. It is reported that two Koreans went to the Soviet Consulate here and read the Russian version of the Moscow Communique, which did not mention the trusteeship plan.

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 4th] The Korean Independence Association announced its establishment today, demanding that US and Soviet troops withdraw from Korea immediately and expressing opposition to the trusteeship system.

### US Secretary of War Arrives in Japan

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 4th] US Secretary of War Patterson landed at Atsugi Airport at 4:30 PM today (Shanghai time). MacArthur welcomed him at the airport. Patterson will stay at the US Embassy and is expected to stay in Japan for a week. During this period, he will visit the headquarters of the Sixth and Eighth Armies and attend a banquet hosted by MacArthur and Chief of Staff Major General Richard.

### US Government Officials Go to Japan to Help MacArthur Implement Policies

[United Press, Washington, 4th] Seven US government officials and one university professor departed from San Francisco today to go to Tokyo to help MacArthur implement the Allied economic management policy towards Japan. The head of the delegation is Edward, an official from the State Department. Other members of the delegation are Hend, a law professor from the University of Washington State; Hawkins, a member of the Federal Trade Commission; Wallace, a member of the Tariff Commission; Fallone, a member of the Securities Commission; Anderson, Dion, and Neal, members of the Department of Justice. The delegation will submit a report within three months.

[United Press, Tokyo, 4th] The Allied General Headquarters recently sent a telegram to the US Department of the Army, requesting the convening of a delegation of 30 prominent American educators to come to Japan to discuss the implementation of democratic education with officials from the Allied General Headquarters, the Japanese Ministry of Education, and the Education Committee.

### Japanese Cabinet Passes Budget

[United Press, Tokyo, 4th] The Cabinet today passed the budget for fiscal year 1946, with revenues of 13,328,000,000 yen and expenditures of 12,812,000,000 yen. This is the first balanced budget since 1930.

### Caribbean Conference Scheduled to be Held Next Month

[US News Service, Washington, 3rd] The State Department announced today that the West Indies Conference initiated by the Anglo-American Caribbean Commission will be held on February 21st in St. Thomas, Virgin Islands. The first West Indies Conference was held in Barbados, British West Indies, in March 1944. According to the provisions of the previous conference, the second conference should be held on US territory under US leadership. The recent announcement by France and the Netherlands to join the Anglo-American Caribbean Commission has made all parties more interested in the future conference. Representatives from the above four countries and their territories will attend the meeting to participate in consultations.

[United Press, Washington, 3rd] The United States has proposed to conclude treaties with Latin American countries stipulating unified action in military affairs to eliminate or prevent aggression anywhere in the Western Hemisphere. All Latin American governments except Argentina are giving it careful consideration today. Latin American diplomatic representatives will present it for discussion at a meeting in the Brazilian capital this spring. Diplomatic circles believe that the US proposal is similar to Uruguay's recent proposal to take collective action in the Western Hemisphere to resist any country that disregards international obligations or denies the inherent human rights of its people. However, the US proposal is only to deal with purely military aggression, while the Uruguayan proposal is to deal with political situations and situations that cause occupational disputes.

### More Than Four Million US Military Personnel Have Been Discharged

[United Press, Washington, 3rd] The authorities announced that from the date of Japan's surrender to December 28th of last year, a total of 4,645,000 US military personnel had been discharged.

### From 1946 Onward, Americans Will No Longer Feel a Lack of Material Goods

[United Press, New York, 4th] From 1946 onward, Americans will no longer feel a lack of material goods. Fathers' white shirts may already be old, mothers may still be waiting to buy a few pairs of silk stockings, and children may still be wearing last year's pajamas, but this situation will not last long. The lack of daily necessities is a thing of the past.

American industrialists predict that the supply of various daily necessities will gradually increase in 1946.

A year ago, smokers had to run around every day to buy a pack of cigarettes, but now you can easily buy a box of your favorite cigarettes everywhere.

Last spring, the supply of meat was extremely scarce, and many families often did not taste meat for several days, but since the end of the war, the demand for meat from the military has gradually decreased, and the supply of meat has begun to increase. Canned food can be seen again in grocery stores. The Department of Commerce estimates that better quality canned food may be sold in the market in the coming months.

Radio and electrical equipment can also be purchased in the market, which is the first time since the war. The National Shoe Manufacturers Association predicts that shoe factories will soon have an adequate number of leather shoes to supply to the American people. Children's shoes seem to be temporarily in short supply due to high demand, but adult shoes, both men and women, will definitely not be in short supply by the summer of 1946.

In early 1945, every American held a rationing card in hand to prepare to receive the items he needed. This year, he can freely buy anything except sugar. Sugar was the first item that the government rationed during the war, and this rationing may continue for quite some time. The president of the Langba Sugar Exchange once predicted that the supply of sugar may still be very scarce in the spring of 1946 and will only improve after April 1st.

Textiles have been in short supply throughout the past year, and this panic may not be alleviated until this summer. A manufacturer said. Sheets and pillowcases that cannot be bought on the market now will reappear in stores in two or three months. Children's underwear and cotton coats will be available in three months.

The time required to restore the supply of adult clothing to pre-war levels will be longer than for other items. Millions of discharged American soldiers need to replenish their new clothes.

According to the American Underwear Manufacturers Association, the supply of underwear and pajamas will improve in six months. Although the production of casual wear and coats is constantly increasing, it is still not enough to meet the demand, so manufacturers hope to wholesale most of their goods to stores this year to meet the urgent needs.

### Killing Without Shedding Blood; Using Gas Vans

Nazi Accomplice Confesses Atrocities

[Reuters, Nuremberg, 4th] Former leader of Himmler's Security Police, Ohlendorf, yesterday detailed the atrocities of the secret police in the Nuremberg court, with defendants such as Goering watching. He admitted to designing group murders and witnessing their execution. Under his guidance, 90,000 Jewish men, women, and children were killed in the Soviet Union. Some were shot in tank trenches and ditches, and some were sent to gas vans. The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãgas vans was to reduce the mental suffering of women and children when they died. At the same time, since there were many unmarried people in the German army, they could be spared the unpleasant task of executing women and children by shooting. People sent to gas vans did not feel pain, which was what the doctor told him, but many of his subordinates were unwilling to undertake the work of cleaning the gas vans, as they believed that such work would cause unnecessary mental disturbances.

### British Government Plans to Create a European United Nations Organization, Preparing to Advance Rapidly Along Political and Economic Lines, Aiming to Form a European Supranational State

[United Press London, 4th] A certain British responsible official, who wishes to remain anonymous, recently declared: the British government has a plan to gradually strengthen the United Nations organization, with a world government as its ideal. This cannot be achieved in the short term, but the British government believes that the United Nations organization should eventually have the sole and direct power to manage a world police force, and all countries should disarm to the point where none dare challenge the world police. British cabinet members have had various ideals, tending towards the merging of the sovereignty of existing countries, which are already being planned today. Diplomats call it the "technical scope," that is, the economic and social methods by which governments serve their people, which constitute the majority of their services. According to the outline of this plan, it will first be proposed to establish a European regional United Nations organization, advancing along both economic and political lines, to move towards the goal of forming a supranational state. Britain emphasizes the early establishment of a European United Nations organization because European countries have suffered from war, with deep and painful wounds, and may be ready to advance rapidly along the path of "international government," and feel that European countries must unite and cooperate to seek revival. In addition, concrete plans for genuine international management of transportation, aviation, and health have been discussed, and the initiators insist that this organization should establish regional offices in each continent to coordinate the actions of various governments and maintain close liaison between member states and the United Nations. British Foreign Secretary Bevin and Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Noel-Baker recently publicly declared a so-called "world parliament," which is what they mean. Britain feels that the United Nations Charter has laid the foundation for a legal and just system that is universal throughout the world, just as American federal law is more important than the laws of various contradictory states.

### America Now Plans to Build a Large Number of Merchant Ships

For the Development of the Shipping Industry

[United Press New York, 4th] The United States is currently planning to build 395 high-speed merchant ships, including many new types of passenger-cargo ships. If this plan is realized, 50% of American goods can be transported by American ships in the future, and these ships will operate on 33 routes. At the same time, the United States also hopes that the routes previously operated by German and Japanese ships can also be replaced by American ships.

Future competition in the Pacific is inevitable. American shipping companies believe that in order to compete with other countries, they should strive for comprehensive service. They believe that the era of large passenger ships is over, and that such ships, unless otherwise used, may not be able to attract customers.

### Selection of Chinese Representatives to Participate in the Trial of Japanese War Criminals Determined: Mei Ju-ao and Hsiang Che-chun to Depart for Japan Soon

[Central News Agency Chongqing, 4th] The Allied Supreme Commander in Tokyo has been preparing for the establishment of an international tribunal to try Japanese war criminals for a long time. Since the arrival of the American representative last month, the preparations have become more active. It is reported that the organization of the court is largely in place and will be formally established and start working soon. Our government has appointed the famous jurists Mei Ju-ao and Hsiang Che-chun as the first batch of representatives to attend. Hsiang will serve as the prosecutor of the court, and Mei will serve as the judge. It is reported that the two will depart for Japan in the coming days. Mei Ju-ao has a Doctor of Law degree from the University of Chicago in the United States. He has served as a professor at Wuhan, Nankai, Central Political, Fudan, and other schools. Since 1934, he has been a member of the Legislative Yuan, acting chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, and is currently also the convener of the Legislative Committee of the Yuan and a member of the Foreign Affairs Special Committee of the Supreme National Defense Council. Hsiang Che-chun is a graduate of Yale University Law School in the United States. He has served as a professor at Central University, a prosecutor of the Supreme Court, the president of the Suzhou Court, and the chief prosecutor of the Shanghai High Court, serving in the judicial sector for more than 20 years.

### Hoping Germany Will Establish an Economic Foundation in Two Years: America Issues a Declaration of Policy Towards Germany

[United Press Washington, 3rd] The State Department, at the request of the War Department, has issued a declaration of American policy towards Germany, so that the American occupation authorities have something to follow. Since the Potsdam Three Giants Conference in August last year, this is the first time any strong nation has given a detailed explanation of its general policy towards Germany. This declaration was also sent to the governments of the Soviet Union, Britain, and France, who are participating in the occupation. American officials are unwilling to predict the reaction of the three countries, only saying that the policy proposed by the United States assumes that Germany can retain its current borders, including the Ruhr industrial area and the Rhineland. This aspect may be opposed by France, because France insists that the above two areas must be cut off from Germany. This policy compromises the "soft" and "hard" factions, and its ultimate goal is to hope that a defeated Germany can re-establish an economic foundation in two years, sufficient to balance income and expenditure, and improve the living standards of its people. However, to achieve this goal, the United States and its United Nations must provide funds or tens of thousands of dollars so that Germany can import necessary goods in the next two years.

Restoring Germany to Normalcy Requires Three Periods

Secretary of State Byrnes further added that Germany must go through three periods before returning to "normal status": The first period, until the spring of this year, the United Nations should achieve the following four things: (1) Prevent a major famine in Germany, and increase American imports when necessary; (2) Increase Germany's coal exports to the countries "swept away" by Germany to the "maximum extent"; (3) Complete the four-power reparations agreement around February 2, and begin establishing implementing agencies; (4) Establish German administrative agencies in finance, transportation, communications, foreign trade, and industry respectively. The second period, from the spring of this year to February 2, 1948, it can be expected that Germany will gradually recover. Except for factories that are dismantled and removed as reparations, all others can be permanently retained by Germany, and German industry can be revived. In the third period, Germany will manage its economy on its own, subject only to some "residual restrictions" from the United Nations. German industry will flourish and can maintain the same standard of living as other countries in Europe. According to an official, according to the implementation of this policy, Germany will neither be a "fishing, forestry, animal husbandry" country, nor can it become a first-class industrial power, capable of launching two wars of aggression in 25 years.

Soviet-Occupied Zone Gradually Becoming Sovietized

[United Press Berlin, 3rd] Five American journalists, inspecting the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany, saw that it was undergoing a Sovietization plan, with experienced communists holding key positions. Agriculture, industry, and mining are all under the management of the German provincial government, with aid and support from the Soviet military administration. The reporters traveled for eight days, passing through the southeastern part of the Soviet-occupied zone, 125 miles south of Berlin, through Saxony to Dresden. This is the first time Western journalists have been allowed to enter the Soviet-occupied zone. According to an exchange plan, Soviet journalists can also go to the American-occupied zone to inspect. The five American reporters were led by four Soviet personnel, and the cars were driven by the American military. The locations they passed through were chosen by the reporters, and they met with German and Soviet administrators in various places.

### Bose's Whereabouts Unknown

[Central News Agency Bengal, 2nd, Reuters] Gandhi said here today to members of the National Congress that he believed Bose (Chairman of the Provisional Indian Government) was still alive, hiding and not coming out. According to reports from Tokyo in August last year, Bose died in a plane crash over Taiwan. Gandhi said, "I admire his bravery and his enthusiasm for loving India, but I disagree with the methods he adopted. The people of India cannot rely on weapons to gain freedom."

### East Indies Offers Minimum Conditions for Reconciliation with the Netherlands, Must Recognize Current Regime

[Reuters Batavia, 4th] According to sources with very good information to reporters yesterday, the Indonesian cabinet members put forward several points during the secret talks with Dutch Deputy Governor-General Van Mook, one of which was that the minimum political conditions for Indonesia's acceptance of reconciliation with the Netherlands must include recognition of the current administrative organs as the government. Once this key point is agreed upon, the future relations between the Dutch and Indonesian can be discussed. Well-informed sources expect that there are three possible paths that can be discussed with Van Mook. One is the most acceptable to the Indonesians, that is, the Dutch recognize the current regime, and then negotiate the special status of the Netherlands in its relationship with Indonesia; the second is joint management between the Netherlands and Indonesia; the third is Indonesia implementing autonomy within the Dutch Republic. Given that Van Mook already knows Indonesia's position, rumors that Van Mook said that the Sjahrir cabinet is unable to govern are making government officials uneasy. However, Indonesians declare that they are prepared to closely study the proposals that Van Mook brought back from the Netherlands.

### Film Producers Prepare to Film a Biography of Sun Yat-sen: Will Seek Suitable Figures in China in the Future, Paul Muni is Willing to Play the Protagonist

[United Press Hollywood, 4th] American film producer Corwin announced today that now that the war is over, he will step up plans to film a biographical film of Mr. Sun Yat-sen. Corwin had this in mind before the war, but he did not immediately start working because the war might give the story a new twist. The two themes in the film are extraterritoriality and democracy. He hopes that by the time the film is completed, the various problems in China will be resolved, so the film can represent the complete realization of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's ideals in some way. Corwin plans to spend $2 million on the production of the film. Part of the capital has been used in the past 18 months to collect information on Mr. Sun Yat-sen's life. Experts such as Owen Lattimore, Dr. Hu Shih, and Senator Thomas are assisting Corwin in this work. Corwin said that Pearl S. Buck is very interested and willing to help write the script. Big star Paul Muni is very willing to play the role of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, but Corwin will travel to China at the beginning of this year and seek suitable figures in the Chinese film and theater circles before determining the cast.

### Inventor of the Atomic Bomb Discusses Germ Warfare

[United Press Philadelphia, 3rd] Professor Urey of the University of Chicago, one of the inventors of the atomic bomb, and winner of the 1934 Nobel Prize, declared today: "If the world has another war, then germ warfare, its horror and destructiveness, may not be less than that of the atomic bomb. If the unlimited use of the atomic bomb continues to exist, then the threat of germ warfare is also inevitable. Germs such as typhoid and anthrax can be spread. In the past five years, human morality has fallen to an unbelievable level. If there is another war, it is difficult to guarantee that it will not fall further. I hope there is a country international law that stipulates that all countries in the world are not allowed to manufacture atomic bombs, only allowed to retain a certain limited amount of fissionable material, and prohibit germ warfare. We should immediately take steps to stop the competition in atomic bomb weapons. If we cannot eliminate the threat of war, it will be difficult to apply atomic energy to peaceful and industrial uses. However, it will take many days for atomic energy to compete with coal, but in the end there will be another industrial revolution, which is even greater than the first."

(New Tide News) The Ningbo Chamber of Commerce Rectification Committee recently learned from representatives of various industries that, as the end of the year is approaching, businesses have accumulated a large number of stored coupons, and should urge the bank authorities to expand the quota and quickly exchange them so that funds can be circulated. After investigation, it was found that these stored coupons have been ordered by the government to be collected, but the quota is limited, and the number of stores is accumulating more and more, not only losing interest, but also feeling that the turnover is not working. The request to expand the quota and collect them as soon as possible is a current need. A meeting was scheduled for the 29th to discuss solutions, and all banks were invited to attend.

### From Darkness to Light: Our Air Force's Eight Years of Bloody Battles ‚Äì Special Contribution from Tiefeng News Agency

Our Air Force can be described as a rising force in the modern history of our nation. Its official birth coincided with the period around the "September 18th" Incident. However, in the arduous national war against Japan, it resolutely shouldered the heavy responsibility of defending the motherland's airspace as a young force. The Chinese Air Force began fighting on August 14th, 1937, and continued until the day Japan accepted unconditional surrender, exactly eight years. Over these eight years, it grew from weakness to strength, from a passive position to actively fighting back, from counterattacks to offensives, personally experiencing the victorious end of this war of resistance against Japan. This process of growth and development seems worth a comprehensive report to the people of the country.

First Battle Achievements Lay the Foundation for the Air Force

Let's look at the achievements of the first day: August 14th, 1937, was the first day the young Chinese Air Force participated in the war against Japan. On this first day, the fighter squadrons shot down six enemy planes over Hangzhou in one fell swoop, creating a glorious record of six to zero. The bomber units braved the harsh weather and flew ten sorties in one day, sinking and damaging more than ten enemy ships in the Wusongkou area of the Huangpu River, destroying countless enemy barracks, warehouses, and military supplies in the Shanghai area. This laid the most solid and firm foundation for the increasingly powerful Chinese Air Force.

The most famous Fourth Pursuit Group, which we call the Zhihang Group, shot down sixty enemy planes within seven days of the start of the war, breaking the combat record of the most famous air units of Britain, America, and Germany during World War I.

Initial Comparison: Only One to Fifty-Three

At the beginning of the war of resistance, from late summer to mid-autumn of 1937, the Air Force's main tasks were to defend the capital, guard the Beijing-Shanghai line, attack enemy ships and positions in the Shanghai war zone, assist ground forces, and strictly defend the front lines. However, China's land was so vast, the war zone so expansive, from Shanxi and Chahar in the north to Guangdong in the south, which place did not need the Air Force? The bomber units' surprise attack on the enemy fleet in the South China Sea in September, the long march to Tanggu in November, and the fighter units' shooting down of the enemy's top fighter pilot, Sanwa Kuan, in Taiyuan in October were a few examples of the Air Force's mobile operations during this period.

At this time, the Chinese Air Force was at a disadvantage in terms of numbers. The lack of aircraft, in particular, was undeniable. According to an analysis by the London Times, the ratio between the Chinese Air Force and the enemy was one to fifty-three during this period.

After struggling for several months in this difficult situation, in December 1937, with the retreat from the capital, Nanjing, the Chinese Air Force's achievements temporarily subsided. However, this silence was not a bad thing; it was about replenishment and training. The Chinese Air Force now needed to further strengthen its own power and further enrich its equipment and tactics, preparing to give the air robbers invading our sacred airspace an even more severe blow in the future.

Unprecedented Victory: Regaining Air Supremacy

The famous "February 18th" battle saw twelve enemy planes shot down over Wuhan in twelve minutes, creating an epoch-making, unprecedented victory. At this time, formations of silver planes soared overhead. Some of these planes were monoplanes, some were biplanes, all of which were state-of-the-art fighter planes lent to us by the friendly Soviet Union. The large number and excellent performance allowed us to truly regain air supremacy in the spring and summer of 1938. At the same time, the bomber units also received a large amount of assistance from the friendly Soviet Union, equipping themselves with the latest twin-engine bombers. The bombing of Taipei on February 23rd gave the enemy an unexpected blow. The humanitarian expedition on May 20th saw formations of Chinese planes descend upon the Japanese mainland, scattering millions of leaflets, which had a great effect in terms of strategy and politics. It is especially worth mentioning the continuous air raids on the Yangtze River launched in the summer of 1938 to defend Wuhan.

Numerous Difficulties: Relying on the Northwest Route

After the retreat from Wuhan and the transfer of the military and political center to Chongqing, the Air Force encountered more difficulties. To strengthen its combat power, the Air Force needed to replenish equipment and train operational personnel. After the Yangtze River traffic was cut off, the main source of equipment had to rely on the Northwest International Route. You can imagine driving unfamiliar planes on unfamiliar international routes, flying over thousands of miles of desolate, uninhabited desert. The climate was harsh and unpredictable, and there were no landmarks to be found on the surface. Just picking up the planes that the friendly nations handed over to us at the border was already extraordinarily difficult. Moreover, during the training and replenishment period, we were still constantly striking the enemy on the journey.

Large Enemy Formations Invade Our Rear

In 1940, Germany relied on air power to destroy many small and weak countries in the European theater. The Japanese invaders, learning a lesson from this fact, vainly tried to emulate it, attempting to eliminate our will to fight by using Douhet's doctrine. From spring to autumn, they constantly used large formations of over a hundred planes to bomb Chongqing, the center of our resistance, and occasionally used smaller formations to harass other important cities in our rear. When Yichang, a vital point on the Yangtze River, fell in June, the enemy planes used Yichang as a forward base, attacking various routes at any time, making the air defense situation even worse. At that time, our air defense units were in an extremely difficult environment. However, the brave men of our fighter squadrons still relied on a spirit of fearless courage to do everything possible to deal with the enemy.

During this same period, the bomber units did not abandon their responsibilities either. Although the number of planes was not large, the battle record was not bad.

After this, from the winter of 1940 to the first half of 1941, news of the Air Force subsided again. At this time, our ally, the United States, had originally promised to provide us with a large amount of aircraft and equipment, but because the Burma Road was blocked for a period of time, it could not be transported in. Moreover, after the Japanese invaders took advantage of France's defeat and occupied Vietnam in one fell swoop, the number of air raids on our southwest regions gradually increased. The fighter squadrons, which were originally small in number, naturally felt even weaker when they were dispersed for use at this time. This period, from the second half of 1940 to the first half of 1941, was perhaps a relatively dark period. However, this darkness was only a brief phenomenon before dawn. After the darkness was broken, dawn followed closely.

Entering a New Stage: Eliminating the Threat of Enemy Planes

From the second half of 1941, the Chinese Air Force's war of resistance entered a new stage. Wasn't air supremacy regained? Since then, wasn't the airspace over the entire Chinese theater of war controlled more firmly than at any time in the past? In the following years, except for a very few places and extremely rare cases, the people across the country were no longer threatened by enemy planes and no longer disturbed by air raids.

During this period, everything was improving. First of all, a large amount of aircraft and equipment were transported from the United States to the Chinese mainland. Immediately after, the Chinese Air Force American Volunteer Group was established in Kunming, fighting alongside us and taking on the task of protecting the southwest international route. Then, on December 8th, 1941, the war between the United States and Japan broke out. The material and spiritual help that the United States gave us was more active than before. Land transportation was insufficient, so air transport was added. From then on, we were no longer fighting alone, but were a member of the entire war against Axis aggression.

After this, our pursuit units had become aerial guerrillas. Wherever enemy planes flew, we chased them. The strength of the Japanese Air Force gradually weakened, and the air defense of our rear became increasingly solid. After this, they no longer dared to risk invading.

American Air Force Officially Established in China

As time entered 1943, the Chinese Air Force's combat operations began to enter a new golden age.

First of all, we should thank our American allies. On March 10th, 1943, the U.S. Army 14th Air Force was officially established in China, fighting alongside the Chinese Air Force. In terms of equipment, the United States was doing its best to supply us according to the Lend-Lease Act. Our air force units had gradually equipped themselves with state-of-the-art American-made aircraft, gaining an absolute advantage in air warfare. In terms of training, the allies were also using their excellent environment, excellent equipment, and technology to share our hard work. After completing training at American Army Air Force bases, many batches of the most outstanding Chinese aviation students immediately returned to their homeland and took to the air battlefield.

Due to the increased strength of our Air Force, it also performed exceptionally brilliantly in battle.

In this year, the fighter squadrons, due to the enemy's shrinking back, could not show their skills in defense, so they bravely and continuously launched attacks, taking on the task of offense. In addition to regularly covering bomber units departing for combat, they also carried small bombs to patrol the skies above the battlefields at any time, dive-bombing enemy troops, vehicles, ships, and supplies on the ground, and delivering ammunition and supplies to ground troops besieged by the enemy. Among them, the most world-shaking and well-known achievements were Captain Zang Xilan's daring rescue of allied Lieutenant Colonel Allison over enemy lines on May 31st, and Major Zhou Zhikai's single-handedly shooting down three enemy planes (a small squadron) over Liangshan base on June 6th. The former was a testament to the noble virtue of the Chinese Air Force's tradition of chivalry, selflessly saving comrades. The latter showed that the Air Force's morale was still high, and technically, it was still defeating the many with the few.

Air Force: A Mixed Sino-American Force

In addition to the U.S. 14th Air Force stationed in China, another powerful air force on the Chinese battlefield, the Sino-American Composite Wing, was officially established on November 6th, 1943. This was a purely offensive air force, possessing the latest large number of aircraft, and composed of a mixture of Chinese and American pilots. The Wing's first achievement was a surprise attack with the U.S. 14th Air Force on the Japanese military base in Taiwan, the Xinzhu Airfield, and the implementation of sweeping bombings along the southeast coast. The enemy ships sunk in the first fifty days alone reached over 30,000 tons.

Concentrated Attacks: The War Situation Immediately Stabilized

From early summer to late winter of 1944, the situation on the Chinese battlefield was indeed at its worst. The enemy transferred elite Kwantung Army troops from Manchuria from afar, making a last-ditch struggle in the Central Plains and Hunan-Guangxi battlefields, vainly attempting to open up the so-called "continental transportation line" to reduce the threat to it from the Allied offensive in the Pacific.

First, the enemy launched the Central Plains campaign, with the main purpose of opening up the Pinghan Railway Line. We do not deny that in the initial battles, the enemy made progress. However, since April 28th, when our Air Force completed its concentration and began operations, the war situation immediately stabilized.

Zhihang Squadron Creates a History of Complete Victory

The fact that the isolated army in Hengyang was able to hold out for forty-seven days was also due to the strong support of the Air Force. What is even more commendable is that in the battles to support the Hengyang garrison, the Air Force's Zhihang Squadron created two completely victorious battles of the annihilation type.

While the Zhihang Squadron was fighting, the Air Force's Fifth Group was carrying out strategic missions in the Hunan war zone, flying over 1,500 sorties from early May to late August.

New Aircraft Replenishment: Developing Long-Range Air Force

Last year was the year the Chinese Air Force faced the victorious end of the entire national war of resistance.

The battles in northern Hubei and southwestern Henan, the battle for our army's base in western Hunan, and the counter-offensive in Guilin-Liuzhou-Nanning were several major military events on the Chinese battlefield this year. Our Air Force not only actively participated but also unleashed its amazing power.

As the situation in western Hunan turned from danger to safety and the National Army's counter-offensive in Guangxi progressed steadily, the Air Force's Second Group took on the task of coordinating with the ground army's operations.

In addition, in early spring of last year, our Air Force fighter squadrons received a batch of new long-range aircraft from our ally, the United States, developing several powerful long-range units. As a result, the major cities and military strongholds in the North China and Central China regions, which had been occupied by the enemy for many years, were also generally attacked by our aircraft, inflicting fatal wounds on the enemy. The more notable achievements were: five attacks on Wuhan, four attacks on Beijing and Shanghai, one bombing of the Dagukou oil depot, and one destruction of the Taiyuan arsenal.

National Reconstruction Period: Rapidly Building Air Defense Forces

Having described the history of the Chinese Air Force's valiant struggle, we believe that the Chinese Air Force played a role as an immortal protagonist in the eight years of the war of resistance. However, the people of the country should not be satisfied with this. The world has entered the age of aviation. If we want to catch up with the times and consolidate our country's strong position in the period of national reconstruction, we must build a new national defense force. We must use the power of the entire nation to assist the government in promoting the Air Force's glorious achievements in the past and build a stronger and more powerful Air Force.

A brave image of our Air Force fighter pilots riding P-51 Mustang fighters to attack the enemy.

### Lamentable Refugee Songs: The Bitter Tale of Yangzhou with Water, Air, and Fire

‚Äî Zhiliang, Reporting from Northern Jiangsu

The people of northern Jiangsu, who have suffered under the enemy and puppet regime, fully believed that peace and happiness would come with victory. Who knew that the Communist Party, disregarding the Supreme Commander's order to "remain stationed in place and await orders," would implement its consistent policy of expanding territory and seeking chaos? This led to the entire northern Jiangsu area falling into a state of chaos. Countless cities and towns were attacked by the Communist army, countless people died in the gunfire, young people fled to other places, and the weak died unattended. Recently, Yancheng fell, Gaoyou was besieged, and Yangzhou and Taizhou were under attack from all sides. Gunfire could be heard within the city, and the situation was tense and frightening.

Embarking on a Journey: A Deep Inspection of Northern Jiangsu

To understand the actual situation in northern Jiangsu, the reporter changed his original plan to spend the first Christmas after the victory celebrating at the Confucius Temple. On the morning when the dignitaries were eating turkey and welcoming Santa Claus around the Christmas tree, I embarked on a journey to Yangzhou, an important town in northern Jiangsu, for a deep inspection. I will now report my observations to the people of the country who are concerned about the current situation in northern Jiangsu.

On the day the reporter arrived in Yangzhou, entry into the city was prohibited due to a household registration check. At the same time, the sound of engines whirred as our planes flew over northern Jiangsu for reconnaissance. It was only two hours later that I took a detour to my residence. On the streets, the National Army had just completed its work of eliminating traitors, and the Communist soldiers who had infiltrated the city had all been brought to justice. The reporter was excited at the time and drove to visit an elder of the local area.

Freezing Cold: The Old and Young Struggling to Flee

He told the reporter very kindly: "These days, northern Jiangsu is indeed very panicked. Shaobo has fallen, Gaoyou is in imminent danger, and the south gate is filled with dead and wounded. The old and young are struggling to flee, the weather is freezing cold, and it is truly a tragic scene. I heard that the Communist Party has gathered a large army and is advancing towards Bubo, Taixian, and the Yangzhou-Taizhou highway. Wherever they go, villages are reduced to rubble, and the people are coerced into serving them to achieve their ambition of expanding their power and occupying all the uncaptured cities in northern Jiangsu before the Political Consultative Conference, forming the so-called "Jiangsu-Anhui Border Region Government." However, he said with firmness and conviction, Yangzhou and Taizhou will be safe, and Gaoyou, Yancheng, and other places will soon be recovered because the National Army is rushing to the scene day and night, their morale is high, and these jumping clowns cannot use their petty tricks. This can be reported to the people of northern Jiangsu who are abroad."

### A Dynamic Force on the Maritime Frontier: A Tour of the Reborn Taiwan

‚Äî Qian Pei, Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Reporting from Taipei

This is the first dispatch since the reporter arrived here. The area observed in the past ten days or so is limited to Taipei and Keelung. My presentation of the government's policies and measures, as well as the people's hardships, will only be a superficial presentation. However, examining the entire picture from this small aspect should be possible.

Aviation Mail Lacks Management: Hong Qiao's Delay

The most frustrating thing the reporter has felt in the ten days or so since arriving here is that Taiwan seems completely isolated from the mainland or can be regarded as a utopia, or a solitary island. Not everyone can travel by plane, and shipping is not yet smooth. It took many days after the reporter arrived here for the letters I sent to my friends in the East to be received, or some were not received at all. This is because the aviation mail often has no one to take care of it at the airport. The mail transferred from the Shanghai Liaison Office of the Taiwan Administrative Governor's Office was often taken to Manila and other ports in the South Seas by American planes on their second arrival in Taiwan. By the time the mistake was discovered and sent back, more than a month had passed. The reporter received his first family letter, which was an express airmail letter sent from Shanghai on December 13th, half a month apart. Although it does not conform to reason and law, it is already very fortunate. The saying "Beacon fires last for three months, a family letter is worth ten thousand gold" is exactly what it feels like.

Unfamiliar with Taiwanese and Japanese: Almost Like a Mute

After arriving here, the language barrier is also a reason for travelers to feel homesick. Japanese and the Hokkien dialect of Xiamen are commonly used here. It is difficult to find one in a hundred people who can understand Mandarin. Therefore, every time I go out, I have to pull along someone who speaks Japanese or Hokkien to act as an interpreter. Whether I am calling a car or shopping, I feel like a mute who cannot express himself.

All Personnel Going to Taiwan: Prohibited from Carrying Legal Tender

The surge in prices in recent months is indeed a fact. However, the authorities' willingness to spare no effort to prevent the impact of inflation from other provinces in the country on Taiwan can be said to have achieved considerable success. In the beginning, when the National Army first arrived, there were incidents of coercing and forcing the use of legal tender, which aroused resentment and resistance from the Taiwanese people. Later, the practice of prohibiting personnel coming to Taiwan from carrying national currency and continuing to use Taiwan Bank's Taiwan currency was put into place, and the turmoil subsided. After this, the Central Bank sent more than 40 staff members to Taiwan, intending to establish a branch here. However, because there was no prospect of business development, they all soon bought boats and returned home. Therefore, there are rumors outside that Governor Chen of Taiwan is blockading Taiwan and closing it off. Adding to this the blockage of transportation and the disruption of aviation and mail, not only people outside the province are talking about it, but even ordinary residents here feel the same way. Thinking about it calmly, the non-circulation of national currency and the temporary non-establishment of a Central Bank branch have indeed prevented inflation in this province. Otherwise, the high prices here would not know how high they would go.

Any Cargo Entering: No Restrictions

Furthermore, under the Administrative Governor's Office, there is a trading company that specializes in the import and export of controlled goods. At present, there are no restrictions on anything being shipped in. However, only food and fertilizer are encouraged to be imported. The absolute prohibition of export is rice because the rice produced in this province this year is not enough for the local people's food needs. Therefore, imports are encouraged and exports are prohibited. Sugar can be exchanged for grain and fertilizer. Rock sugar and square sugar cannot be freely exported and must be exchanged at value with the Taiwan Trading Company. Coal is semi-controlled. Coal production is lower than before, so various public, public, and factories in the province are in urgent need of coal. Therefore, it must be restricted, but not absolutely prohibited from export. However, in fact, there is no profit to be made from exporting coal unless shipping is developed in the future. Although the price of coal is only 200 Taiwan dollars per ton (equivalent to 40 to 50 national currency), the black market water fee is 5,000 yuan per ton (over 100,000 national currency). If counterfeit currency is added, it reaches 20 to 30 million per ton.

Regarding the contents of the Taiwan Trading Company, the reporter has not yet conducted a detailed investigation, so I will leave it aside for the time being. How the exchange prices of food, fertilizer, and sugar are set, and whether the trading company is truly as the authorities say, not competing with the people for profit, returning every bit to the public, and taking from the people and returning to the people, cannot be discussed for the time being.

High-Ranking Officials Taking Prostitutes as Concubines: Listed as Secretaries

Furthermore, there is something else to report to the people of the country. The takeover work here is also quite chaotic. Some say it is not as bad as in the mainland. The competition between the central government's special representatives and the Administrative Governor's Office is fierce, and they tend to flock to where the profits are. The strange things the reporter has heard and seen are endless. A certain high-ranking central official used a Japanese person to handle the takeover, causing a big joke. There are also various tricks regarding officialdom. A certain official took a prostitute as a concubine, listed her as a secretary, and actually took office. However, he has been given a penalty of dismissal and investigation. There are also those who have been reprimanded by the Administrative Governor for liking to dance. There are all kinds of things. The fact that the private lives of public officials cannot fully satisfy the people, or give the Taiwanese people a chance to doubt and despise them, is also an undeniable fact. However, I heard that Administrative Governor Chen Yi has the intention of rectifying officialdom and working hard to govern. Writing this far, I conclude with infinite emotion.

Editorial

### Stale Views of Chinese and Foreigners

After eight years of arduous struggle and bloody battles by the Chinese military and civilians, and four and a half months since the enemy surrendered and victory was celebrated, China should be a new, independent, and sovereign nation. With unequal treaties abolished and the United Nations organization about to be established, China should especially be a new, independent, and sovereign nation, not only as a member of the democratic nations' camp during and after the war, but also as one of the so-called four or five powers. However, it is strange that in official circles and society, many glaring actions are still unconsciously revealed, as if China were still a semi-colonial country, the same as before it contributed, fought, and bled. Especially in Shanghai, this city, the so-called concession of the five treaty ports in a century of humiliation, the overbearing foreign bosses, and the obsequious compradores are still strikingly visible today. Perhaps some friendly people who have been in China for a while still have a sense of racial superiority in their hearts; and after a century of humiliation, some Chinese people inevitably still have some inferiority complexes. These two psychological factors intertwined result in many distressing facts. For the sake of the construction of a new China and to genuinely enhance friendship between China and foreign countries, we must clarify some stale views of both Chinese and foreign people.

Let's cite a few examples: For instance, at the San Francisco conference last year, Chinese language was listed as one of the common languages, which shows that it is a matter of course to use Chinese language in official documents in China. For the convenience of international exchange, it is okay to attach translations and speak some foreign languages. But it is unnecessary to say that only those who can speak foreign languages and understand foreign texts are qualified in Chinese officialdom and society. Some time ago, a foreigner wrote an article and recklessly criticized, saying that a certain official was not proficient in English and lacked qualifications, which was already extremely strange, and yet some Chinese people echoed his words. Well, then, are the officials in major trading ports in Europe and America proficient in Chinese? Also, for the convenience of liaison with friendly countries in post-war relief work, it is only natural to recruit talents, especially those who are proficient in foreign languages. But as rumors circulate, saying that foreigners cannot trust our Chinese officialdom, especially local governments, so everything must be done by breaking away from the existing government institutions, starting everything from scratch, and even distributing relief and dispensing favors must rely on foreigners. Such an attitude is simply undervaluing oneself too much. If such a mentality prevails, the result will inevitably be a society where compradores are still in power, and the Chinese people will still be stuck in the stage of depending on the whims of foreign bosses.

I heard that the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau recently seized a batch of newspapers, about two or three hundred bundles, in a warehouse in Shanghai. According to people from the Naval Headquarters, the total number is more than two thousand bundles. The exact number has not yet been announced by the bureau. They are about to be distributed and sold to newspapers to alleviate the paper shortage. But a certain Swedish came out and said that he bought these papers from the Japanese, and the ownership should belong to him. As a result, the bureau has delayed the distribution and sale. We want to ask: When the enemy puppets controlled paper in Shanghai, which Japanese person could sell paper? And after August 10th, by what right did the Swedish person have to buy paper from the Japanese? We cannot fail to investigate these matters clearly just because a foreigner is involved.

What is most incomprehensible is that recently, the French warship "Berdin" actually took prisoners away from Shanghai without authorization, claiming that the French Consul General still holds consular jurisdiction. According to this statement, it seems that French officials still do not treat us as equals. We recall how France treated us during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, which is truly heartbreaking. The Vichy government of P√©tain and the Annam government of Decoux helped the Japanese to invade China. They blockaded the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, and signed a treaty with the Japanese to sacrifice Annam, allowing the Japanese to use Annam as a springboard to attack Yunnan, Guangxi, and invade the Pacific. The Chinese truly felt like drinking cold water in the cold winter, every drop painful. How they colluded with the enemy puppets in Shanghai to oppress the good people of China should not be forgotten by the citizens of Shanghai. The current French government has signed a new treaty of equality with our country. Even if it has not yet been signed, does France still want to show the evil face of old imperialism in China, acting arbitrarily and damaging China's sovereignty? If that is really the case, no wonder General Hurley said that there are still some imperialists in the Far East! China does not want to take advantage of others, but at least China should not bow its head to others for no reason today. We believe that the wise French government and far-sighted French people will certainly not let these stale ideas forever blind the hearts of a few of their lagging followers.

What is most unacceptable is that some people in Shanghai seem to have forgotten the suffering of Chinese and foreigners when the Japanese occupied the city, and instead are more critical of the Chinese government after the victory, demanding perfection and criticizing it more and more. According to these people's thinking, would they rather invite the Japanese to slaughter and rule us again! Please ask yourselves: What was the life of Shanghai citizens like during the occupation, in terms of food, clothing, housing, and transportation? What was the life of foreigners like? Today, under the management of the National Government and the Shanghai Municipal Government, no matter how unsatisfactory it may be to you, there is always enough rice to eat, cloth to buy, houses no longer need to be demolished or seized by the enemy, and you no longer need to pay tolls when walking. In Shanghai over the past two or three months, we have only heard strange words like "Shanghai people" and "Chongqing people," but we must know that traitors or quasi-traitors who depend on the enemy cannot be forgiven just because they are "Shanghai people," and cannot transform themselves into loyal and steadfast men just because they also join the "Shanghai people" in cursing the "Chongqing people."

We must recognize one major thing, that is: China is now a new, independent, and sovereign nation, a new nation that stands on an equal footing with any country in the world. This independent, equal, and sovereign international position is more than one hundred and eight thousand miles away from a semi-colony. We must not allow the slave mentality of a semi-colony for a hundred years to bind ourselves again! We must give the great credit for winning independence, equality, and sovereignty to the military and civilians who endured eight years of hard struggle against Japan, and it is the National Government we support that led the anti-Japanese war to victory.

### Rumors of Foreign Exchange Listing Abound, Gold and Banknotes See Decline, Securities Market Continues to Be Strong

Spot exchange started stably yesterday, but because the expected listing problem during the closure period was not realized, many parties closed their positions, and buying interest was frustrated. As a result, after the highest price of 815,000, supply consistently exceeded demand. However, it struggled at the 800,000 mark in the middle. Finally, as the U.S. dollar continued to decline, many long positions collapsed at noon. Rumors spread that the U.S. dollar listing was divided into four levels from 1,000 yuan to 1,600 yuan, and the factory material demand was set at 1,200 yuan. Selling interest suddenly soared, once seeing around 777,000. In the afternoon, it hovered around 785,000. As a result, it fell 19,000 compared to before the closure. Gold jewelry was listed at 84,000, silver taels at 600 yuan, and silver coins hovered around 430. The dark exchange rate stood at around 10% because of slightly more demand.

Due to the closure, small money changers' retail income was quite large. Spot goods were sold off. The listing was not implemented. People's hearts were already depressed. After an initial 1,435 yuan in the morning, the U.S. dollar gradually declined. At noon, there were rumors of U.S. dollar listing divided into four levels from 1,000 to 1,600, with the second level for legitimate factory needs set at 1,200. The 1,400 mark was broken, falling below 1,380. It gradually stabilized in the afternoon. As a result, it recovered 30 yuan compared to the end of last year. The street currency saw increased selling as the local Shanghai exchange rate rose. It weakened from firm. Old currency fell 5 yuan, and new currency fell a little more than 4 yuan.

Government bonds still saw active trading by silver shops' surplus funds. Type C was once pushed to a high price of 880. Industry insiders sold off at high prices. There was a slight recovery at noon. As a result, it was 30 to 90 yuan better than before the closure. Because of the air of intervention by the authorities, Chinese stocks initially showed fear and fatigue. New Guang once retreated to within 50 yuan, Yongsha fell to 830 yuan, and Meiya within 620 yuan. Large investors undermined the market. Gradually, the stocks rallied near noon. Securities brokers came to hype the market at noon, and it became strong again. Yongsha rose to 930 yuan, and Meiya pushed to the 700 yuan mark. Finally, there were slight profit-taking at high prices, and a slight downturn was seen. A portion of the surplus funds in the industry had a tendency to shift to the gold market, and the trend became erratic. As a result, stocks were mixed compared to last year. Various unpopular stocks showed different results due to varying preferences of surplus funds. Foreign stocks continued to rise, while unpopular stocks slightly declined. On the whole, the number of rises still exceeded the number of falls. Compared to before the closure, Yisha rose 50 yuan, Yipi 70 yuan, Paper Industry 85 yuan, Asia rose 30 yuan, British Alliance 50 yuan, and Ken Zhi 20 yuan, which were still buying prices. Various rubber stocks continued to advance.

### Stable Food Market, Soybean Cake Situation Continues to Be Strong

The rice market remained calm in digestion. Although the owners were firm, they were unable to boost the market. The market situation was similar to the closing price at the end of the year. However, Xian rice was scarce and slightly outstanding. The Fujian gang took over the flour business, and the market trended stable. Oil shops took advantage of the opportunity to take delivery. The market turned from weak to strong, recovering several hundred yuan. Soybeans were slightly tight. Nanyang continued to handle soybean cakes. The situation was still active, and prices rose slightly. Raw peanuts were selling well in winter, rising another thousand yuan. The wine market was stable.

### Coal Market Rises Again, Firewood and Charcoal Market Firm

The coal market saw strong real sales. All goods generally rose. White coal screened lumps continued to sell well. The inventory was insufficient. New highs were created. The previously depressed white coal dust also followed suit and began to rebound. Coking coal lumps were selling well to users, and the market prospects improved. Coking coal dust only saw slight inquiries from small factories. The market price was stable. Firewood and charcoal benefited from the rise in the coal market and northwest winds, and ship arrivals were not strong. The market followed and firmed up.

### Cotton Yarn Supply Falls Short of Demand, Market Price Rises in a Straight Line

Yesterday, the yarn market rose in a straight line. All kinds of merchant gangs gathered, and buying interest remained strong. The Hong Kong and Guangdong gangs were still actively searching for 20-count Double Horse yarn, starting at 750,000 and gradually rising to 790,000 at the close. People's hearts were buoyant and not discouraged by the mediocre gold prices. According to statistics, large 20-count yarn and fine yarn rose 100,000, ordinary 20-count yarn rose 50,000 to 60,000, and 16-count and 10-count yarn only rose 30,000. There was still a shortage of fine goods. Production will only increase after a large amount of American cotton arrives at the port.

### The Enamel Industry in Shanghai

Enamel is the common name for enamel. It is impossible to know exactly when and where it was invented. In the 19th century, Germany and Austria began to have enamel industries. Later, the United States made extraordinary efforts to study this industry and made rapid progress. Japan began to promote this industry between the 41st and 42nd years of the Meiji era. It was most developed during the First World War. China's Jingtai blue was invented very early, but the real enamel industry has only existed since the Republic of China.

The history of the enamel industry in Shanghai is only about 30 years, but its development is truly astonishing. Recalling the early years of the Republic of China, Yao Mulin and others founded the China Fine Arts Enamel Company and hired Liu Dasan, an engineer who had studied in Austria, to take charge. Not long after the opening, it was hit by the European war, and raw materials could not be imported, so it was unable to start work, so there were no products to the world. Seeing no achievements, Liu and Liu Dongqing reorganized the China Fine Arts Enamel Company into the Gefeng Enamel Company, set up a factory and started work, imitating Japan, and gradually had products. This was the beginning of Shanghai having a formal enamel factory. In the early days of Shanghai's enamel factory, almost all raw materials were imported from foreign countries. The so-called enamel factory was only a processing and manufacturing facility. In the years 13 and 14 of the Republic of China, although there were methods of making enamel domestically, the results were still mediocre and far inferior to foreign goods. After the National Revolutionary Army established itself in Shanghai, various enamel factories already had a considerable foundation, and new factories were also established one after another. From then on, there was progress every year, and business also developed accordingly. Therefore, in terms of actual sales, domestic enamel occupied the first place, and imported goods almost disappeared, recovering interests, which was truly not a small amount. Since the outbreak of the all-out war of resistance, it was not easy to concentrate talents and add raw materials due to the environment, so there was no development to speak of. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, it was completely shut down. After the victory news came, the Yisheng Enamel Factory was the first to fully resume work. Its products were more refined than before, and almost all daily enamel products were available. Later, Jiufeng and Jiuxin also resumed work one after another.

Enamelware can be divided into several categories:

(1) Hollow enamelware for household use

(2) Enamelware for chemical use

(3) Steam and other enamel tubes

(4) Water pipes and enamel pipes for water leakage

(5) Enamel signs

Among them, the most widely used is the first item, which comes in many varieties, such as washbasins (which can be divided into flat-edged, turned-over, deep-shaped, and rolled-edged, etc.), spittoons (which can be divided into bottle-shaped, persimmon-shaped, and ordinary, etc.), pots (including rice pots, soup pots, etc.), cups (ordinary and machine-made), buckets, bedpans, wash tubs, tea trays, vegetable basins, rice bowls, coffee pots, stew wine pots, kerosene stoves, water bottles, soap dishes, and all kinds of floral and plain food baskets, etc. Almost all kinds of household utensils are available in enamelware. Because it is lightweight, clean, and durable, it is welcomed by modern families, and the original utensils have been gradually eliminated.

The use of enamel is so broad, but there are very few complete enamel factories in Shanghai. The names of the members who have joined the guild are listed below in order of their founding year:

Factory Name, Factory Address, Manager

Zhufeng, Binlang Road, Tong Jitong

Yifeng, Fanhangdu, Dong Jifu

Zhonghua, Xiaoshadu Road, Fang Jiangge

Huafeng, Mabai Road, Li Zhishi

Jiuxin, Sapo Sai Road, Qian Zongjian

Jiufeng, Hede Road, Xu Langxing

The above companies are all organized as joint-stock companies. In addition to those who have not joined the guild, there are more than ten companies such as Daxin, Dafeng, Guanghua, Chengfeng, Hefeng, and Nanhua.

China's industry has always been considered backward, but the enamel industry is an exception. Over the past 20 years, it has progressed by leaps and bounds, which is unimaginable to outsiders. The Japanese have done everything possible to seize China's commercial field, but they have no room to intervene in the enamel industry, which is also enough to console us. (Yang Kangnian)

### Asphalt Sales Strong, Prices Stable

Asphalt is in the middle of its peak season, and the market is gradually stabilizing. The production of Jinlan and other places is not strong, so the transportation to Shanghai has long since disappeared, and the arrival of goods in Shanghai is becoming less and less. It is heard that the hemp asphalt concentrated in Hankou has other sales channels and can be temporarily prevented from being transported to Shanghai. However, the Shanghai market only has candle and Tao uses, which is not as complicated as soap making. Therefore, although the market is firm, it is not easy to see it rise. However, it is stable and more than sufficient. The current price of each line is 21,000 yuan for Heben, 18,000 yuan for Gaolan oil, slightly down to 16,000 yuan, and 15,000 yuan for Chen Macheng oil.

### Mobil and Texaco Load Large Quantities of Oil

There were also more than 5,000 bales of cotton and more than 10,000 boxes of oil from Mobil and Texaco.

### Commercial News Summary

Peach meat was stable and slightly outstanding. Longkou vermicelli and dried bamboo shoots all rose sharply. Foreign goods and seafood were supported by insiders, so there were few transactions.

The dye market was highly anticipated before the holiday, but the market is still as it was. Seeing that gold prices did not improve at all, the merchant gangs were discouraged, resulting in few transactions.

It is heard that a chemical factory in this city is actively preparing to resume work, specializing in the production of sodium sulfide, and the price is lower than the market price, which has stabilized the market. Other chemical raw materials have not improved or declined.

Cotton cloth and white embryos are still in short supply. Dyeing and weaving factories are purchasing them actively. The spot price is considerably higher than the line unit price.

Daylily has been scarce recently, and sales have been quite active. Therefore, the market has been rising steadily. The goods opened at 30,000 outside the check number and are now shouting up 40% to 50%. A small number of transactions yesterday reached 46,000 yuan.

Yesterday, the cigarette market saw a decline in popularity because Touzhong and Huacheng were about to produce products and the gold market was weak. Supply exceeded demand, and the market fell in both the morning and afternoon.

The Restoration Committee of Jiashan Private Xiuzhou Middle School held a symposium at the Shanghai YMCA on Baxianqiao Road on the 3rd. Attendees including Wu Shaoshu, Tang Mingshi, Gu Zhongyi, Gu Huiren and others unanimously resolved to quickly raise funds and actively restore the school.

The original school buildings, equipment, books, and instruments of the Private Haimen Middle School were completely burned down by the enemy and puppets, making restoration impossible. Now, local education enthusiasts Chen Shiquan, Shen Wanqian, Shi Shuzhi, and alumni Shi Konghuai and Cai Yinen have contacted education enthusiasts from Tongzhou, Haimen, and Qidong to form a school restoration committee. The first meeting was held on the 3rd of this month at the Renshe Society on Fuxu Road in this city. In addition to the aforementioned individuals being immediately elected as standing committee members, two committees, namely the Economic Committee and the Design Committee, were organized to actively launch the school restoration work.

The Shanghai Primary School Teachers Joint Advancement Association will hold a weekly lecture at Yicai Middle School tomorrow morning at 8:30. Mr. Wang Zhicheng will lecture on "Educational Problems."

The alumni association of the Renhe Senior Midwifery Vocational School is stepping up preparations for alumni to join the Midwives Association. For their own benefit, all alumni should immediately bring their Ministry of Health certificate or graduation certificate, three half-length photos without hats, and 1,600 legal tender yuan for membership fees to the school to complete the registration procedures.

### Zhejiang Province Education Restoration Requires at Least 4 Billion Yuan. Xu Shaodi Presents to the Ministry to Seek Additional Funding.

[Our Hangzhou Correspondent] When Minister Zhu visited Hangzhou last year, he verbally approved an allocation of 300 million yuan for Zhejiang Province's education restoration funds. The provincial government, following Minister Zhu's instructions, first allocated 50 million yuan for prioritized use. According to the Education Department, this small amount of funding is insufficient to restore the many public and private educational and cultural institutions in the province. The relocation, renovation, and equipment required for restoration are all costly. Even with extreme austerity, at least 4 billion yuan is needed. This is a drop in the bucket and will not solve the problem. Director Xu Shaodi has telegraphed Minister Zhu, requesting additional funding and asking for it to be issued promptly so that the restoration work can be completed quickly. (Butterfly)

### From the War of Resistance to Victory, Education in Fujian Cities and Other Places, One View

‚Äî Huang Chuiqing

During the War of Resistance, the northwest of Fujian Province was relatively safe, so many schools that were relocated from other places sought temporary refuge there. In order to meet various needs, the government also established other specialized schools there. Higher education in Fujian had always lagged behind, but this allowed it to become the leader in the southeastern provinces. In the eight years, four relocated schools arrived: National Jinan University, National Southeast Associated University (formerly merged with Yingshi University), National Zhongzheng Medical College, and Jiangsu College. Five new specialized schools were established: National Music College, National Maritime, Land, and Air School, Provincial Agricultural College, Provincial Medical College, and Provincial Normal College. Including the province's original four schools ‚Äì National Xiamen University, Private South China Women's College of Arts and Sciences, Private Fujian School, and Private Union University ‚Äì the province had a total of twelve schools above the specialized level. Most of them were scattered in remote areas of northwestern Fujian. The exterior was surrounded by high mountains and dense forests, limiting their view. The interiors had incomplete housing and poor equipment. For years, they struggled with disease and nature. The suffering experienced by the faculty and students cannot be described in words. After the victory of the War of Resistance, the schools changed frequently. In order to provide clarity to all parties, this document will summarize the distribution, equipment, and future restoration plans of each school over the years.

I. Overview of National Institutions

(I) National Xiamen University: At the beginning of the War of Resistance, the school was ordered to withdraw to Changting in western Fujian, so all books and instruments were complete. Since Mr. Sa Bendong took over as president, the school's affairs have progressed rapidly. Young people from all over Southeast China have flocked to it, and the school's reputation has risen steadily. The school has four colleges: Arts, Science, Law, and Commerce, of which the College of Science has the best performance. There are currently more than 2,000 students and more than 100 faculty members. This year, President Sa resigned due to official business, and his vacancy will be filled by Mr. Wa Deyeo, Dean of the School of Science. The school address is confirmed to be Xiamen, and first-year freshmen have already arrived in Xiamen early to register for classes. All personnel are scheduled to be completely relocated to Xiamen before July this year.

(II) National Jinan University: After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the entire school withdrew to Fujian, and the school site was temporarily selected in Tongyou Township, the suburbs of Jianyang in northern Fujian. The initial equipment was extremely rudimentary, but after several years of active improvement by President He Bingsong, it began to take shape. The school has three colleges: Arts, Science, and Commerce, with more than 1,300 students. After the end of the war, it was rumored that the school's permanent address would be moved to Shantou to facilitate overseas Chinese students from Fujian and Guangdong. Later, due to the requests of alumni from all over the world, the discussion was abandoned, and it has now been decided to move to Nanjing. However, before the school buildings are completed, classes will temporarily be held at the original Shanghai site this summer.

(III) National Music College: Established in the autumn of 1942, it was originally the Fujian Provincial Music Teacher Training Institute, and later expanded into a national specialized school. The school address is in Jishan, Yong'an, the wartime provincial capital of Fujian. It has two departments: undergraduate and normal. The departments are further divided into theory, composition, music, orchestral, and national music groups. The former presidents were Cai Jikun, Lu Qian, Liang Longguang, and Zhang Zhaohuan. The current president is the famous songwriter Tang Xueyong. The school has about 200 students, including many foreign professors. The school has sound musical equipment and the students are very active. After the war, it was reported that the college would be moved to Nanjing.

(IV) National Maritime School: In the autumn of 1944, in order to train talents for the construction of Taiwan and other maritime regions after the war, the central government ordered Mr. Zhang Zhaohuan to come to Fujian to prepare for the establishment of the school. He finally completed the preparations in a short period of time, selected Xianyou as the school site, and immediately began to enroll students. (Last year, the Ministry of Education appointed Liang Longguang as the president. Liang moved the school to Jiudu in Nanpi, southern Fujian, because he thought the local area would be difficult to develop.) The school is quite large in scale, with plans to establish four departments: administration, normal, technology, and special classes. Each department is further divided into groups. Currently, the administrative department only enrolls civil administration and education groups. The normal department has two groups: literature and history, and civic education (according to the current organizational change, the school will now operate a two-year and a five-year normal education department). Students are mainly from southern Fujian, and all expenses are covered by the school, so enrollment is extremely competitive. After the war, the school address was reported to be set in Taiwan.

(V) National Zhongzheng Medical College: The college was originally in Jiangxi. Last year, when southern Jiangxi was captured, it suddenly moved to Changting to hold classes. It has two departments: medicine and pharmacy. After the merger with the Yingshi University Medical College last year, the number of students increased to about 300. It is now about to move back to Jiangxi.

II. Overview of Private Institutions

(I) Private Union University: It is run by the church, established in the early Republic of China. The school address is in Kuiqi near Fuzhou. The school buildings are located on the mountainside facing the sea, which is extremely spectacular. After the War of Resistance, it was relocated to Shaowu, northern Fujian. The school has three colleges: Arts, Science, and Agriculture. There are more than 800 students. The principal is Mr. Lin Jingkuo. The school has rigorous curriculum, a strong atmosphere of reading and research, and its performance is the best among all private schools. This semester, a part of the school buildings in Shaowu was suddenly burned down, causing heavy losses. Due to the rampant plague in Shaowu, the entire school ended early on November 25 last year and moved out immediately. It is said that it will return to its original site this spring and start school.

(II) Private South China Women's College of Arts and Sciences: It is also run by the church. Before the war, it was located in Huqian Mountain, Fuzhou. It was relocated to Nanping in 1938. It has four departments: foreign languages, home economics, chemistry and biology. There are more than 200 students. The president, Ms. Wang Shijing, studied in the United Kingdom and the United States in her early years. Other professors are also mostly scholarly women. The school spirit is calm and simple, and the music equipment is very good. It is reported that the school ended at the end of last year and will move back to Fuzhou this semester.

(III) Private Fujian College: The school was established in 1912. Its predecessor was the Fujian College of Law and Politics. In 1931, it was renamed to its current name. The original site was in Baishui well, Fuzhou. During the war, it was relocated to Baiyundu, Minqing. It has three departments: law, politics, and economics, with more than 400 students. The president is Mr. Guo Gongmu, and the chairman of the board is Mr. Chen Peikun, a prominent gentleman from Fujian Province. Alumni are all over Fujian and cooperate very closely. In June of this year, Fuzhou was recaptured. The college was the first to move back to its original site, making it the first school in the country to restore its campus.

(IV) Jiangsu College: It was established by the War Zone Command to accommodate displaced students from various places. Its predecessors were the Suwan Institute of Technology and the Suwan College of Political Science. Later, it was separated from Anhui College and renamed to its current name. In 1943, the school address was moved from Chong'an to Sanyuan. The president is Mr. Zai Keguang, and the chairman of the board is Mr. Gu Zhutong. It has seven departments: foreign languages, politics, economics, mathematics and physics, mechanical engineering, literature and history, and administrative management, with more than 470 students. In recent years, the college has achieved remarkable results and has cultivated many young people in the southeastern provinces. The new school address has been selected in Yangzhou, and it will be moved this year.

III. Newly Established Institutions in Fujian Province

(I) Provincial Normal College: Established in 1940, the school address is in Shuinan, Nanping. It has seven departments: Chinese, history and geography, mathematics and science, education, physical education, and art. The purpose is to train secondary school teachers for the entire province. In recent years, the graduates of each session have performed very well in their services, and the school's reputation has been improved. The current president is Mr. Lin Xiqian (Speaker of the Fujian Provisional Senate), and the school has more than 400 students. The school address has been surveyed and determined to be Wushi Mountain in Fuzhou. The last semester ended on December 15, and all classes will be held in Fuzhou this semester.

(II) Provincial Medical College: Established in 1937, the school address is in the county seat of Shaxian. The entire college is a medical department, with a six-year study period. There are currently about 400 students, and the equipment is relatively complete. The students have a good atmosphere for research. In the performance assessments held by the Ministry of Education in the past, the college has always been among the best. The new school address is set to be Jixiang Mountain in Fuzhou and the college will move there soon.

(III) Provincial Agricultural College: Established in 1940, the school address is in Huangli, Yong'an. It has departments of horticulture, plant pathology and entomology, and forestry. There are currently more than 200 students. On the issue of the school address, students insist on moving to Fuzhou. However, the provincial government has not approved the move because it is worried that the educational institutions in the western Fujian area will be excessively impoverished in the future.

People in Fujian Province, in order to commemorate the late Chairman Lin, are discussing the combination of these three provincial schools into a National Linsen University, and are currently making various requests. It is expected that this will be realized soon.

Donghua has added the three musketeers Liu Xianhan, Song Lingsheng, and Zheng Yingquan this time, and the lineup can be said to have reached the ideal state. The Soviet Union has famous players from the former Shanghai Police Suker team, so their strength is still good. When they meet Donghua, they will definitely go all out. According to Jia Youliang, the lineup is roughly as follows:

Zhang Banglun, Liu Xianhan, Li Ning, Zhuang Youren, Song Lingsheng, Tan Fuzhen, Zhang Linggen, Zheng Yingquan, Li Yao, Sun Jinshun, Dai Linjing, Han Longhai, Jia Youliang, Chen Mingzhe

Today there are also two Group B games, and the full schedule of the games is recorded below:

Donghua vs. Soviet Union (Group A) 2:30 PM, Jiaozhou Park

### French Ship Illegally Transports War Criminal Abroad, Sino-French Friendship Affected, City Government Publicly Announces Protest Text, All Circles Advocate Effective Measures, French Consul-General Expresses Difficulty

[Report from Our Newspaper] This port's French consulate police illegally arrested French Nazi member Kakebinopino. Disregarding our country's protests, they set sail on the 3rd with the light cruiser "Bellet" after secretly detaining the criminal, which has drawn close attention from all circles, both Chinese and foreign. This reporter recently interviewed Lu Huaijun, secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office, who informed me that all case files regarding this matter have already been compiled and submitted to Chongqing, and we are currently awaiting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' decision. Mr. Lu stated: There are approximately 4,000 French troops and 600 French expatriates stationed in Shanghai. Before the French warship arrived in Shanghai, it reported to the city government according to the law, stating that its mission was to withdraw troops and expatriates. Unexpectedly, it engaged in the illegal act of escorting a criminal. This reporter subsequently learned from diplomatic circles in this city that if this incident is not resolved appropriately, French ships may encounter difficulties in the future when coming to Shanghai, and Sino-French relations and trade may suffer adverse effects. There is even a possibility that the French consulate in this city may be closed.

City Government's Protest Is Just and Forceful

The original text of the city government's protest to the French Consulate-General in Shanghai regarding the Kakebinopino case was published yesterday. The protest letter stated: "It is hereby noted that consular jurisdiction of all countries in China has been abolished. Your country's ambassador to China has notified our Ministry of Foreign Affairs that he has ordered the Consul-General in Shanghai to immediately close the consular court. However, this government has recently received reports that the Consul-General has independently arrested French Nazi citizens residing in Shanghai, Paul-Francois Kakebinopino de Sousli, etc., and plans to hand over Kakebinopino to the French warship recently docked in Shanghai and send him back to France in the near future. This government hereby informs your Consul-General that such actions are a clear and intentional sabotage of the abolition of extraterritorial rights, which our government should strictly prohibit. On the first day of this month, we sent a letter to our Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office to lodge a strong protest, requesting that the aforementioned criminal be handed over to our country's judicial organs for legal processing. Now, the Shanghai Office's letter No. Hu Er (35) 2 states: 'This office has prepared a strong protest letter, which Secretary Lu personally delivered to the French Consul-General in Shanghai at 4 PM this afternoon. In addition to receiving his promise to provide a written reply within days, he verbally stated: The Consul-General's office did indeed independently arrest a French Nazi citizen named Kakebinopino based on the consular jurisdiction stipulated in the old French treaty, and today it transported him to the docked French warship in accordance with French law, and will be transported back to France by the warship tomorrow or the day after. Now that it has received this office's protest regarding this case, it is willing to immediately telegraph the French Ambassador to China for instructions.' Later investigations revealed that this case was previously approved by your Consul-General's office's letter dated December 7, 34th year, which briefly stated: 'The French government intends to dispatch a warship to Shanghai in the near future, and pass through Shanghai and Saigon several times, in order to successively withdraw the French army stationed in Shanghai and French expatriates. It is not known whether your Mayor has any objections to the implementation of this plan. Please inform us immediately.' This was then telegraphed to the National Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which replied: 'The government has ordered French warships to come to Shanghai, with the task limited to withdrawing troops and expatriates,' and has replied to your Consul-General for verification. This warship is limited to withdrawing troops and expatriates. Now, it is escorting criminals, which is obviously beyond the scope of its assigned task. Now, since your Consul-General has agreed to immediately telegraph your country's ambassador to China for instructions, please be informed that the warship should be temporarily delayed from leaving the port until a proper solution is reached. Otherwise, your Consul-General should bear full responsibility for all consequences. Please investigate and act accordingly."

Social Organizations Advocate Serious Negotiations

Our country's diplomatic departments attach great importance to this case and will launch serious negotiations separately in Chongqing and Shanghai, striving to achieve a satisfactory solution. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office is now preparing to continue negotiations with the French authorities based on instructions from the Ministry after the Chongqing reply is received in Shanghai. Various social organizations in this area are also gathering to urge the government to lodge strong protests with the French side and take effective measures to safeguard the integrity of our country's sovereignty and legal rights. It is reported that Kakebinopino's crimes are quite similar to those of the British traitor Lord Haw-Haw, who was hanged. During the enemy puppet's occupation, he was driven to collect intelligence for the enemy and served as a broadcaster on Nazi radio, making distorted propaganda that was detrimental to the Allied countries.

French Consul-General Admits Lack of Familiarity

Regarding the French warship "Bellet" secretly transporting the French traitor Kakebinopino from Shanghai to Saigon for trial, which is a disrespect for our sovereignty and has aroused the attention of the general public here, this reporter specially visited Mr. Fei Lihao, the French Consul-General in Shanghai, yesterday afternoon to inquire about everything. Mr. Fei admitted that the warship did indeed depart from the Huangpu River at 9:50 AM on the 3rd and sailed to Saigon. Rear Admiral Felipe, the captain of the warship, was responsible for all actions of the warship, and the French traitor Kakebinopino was also escorted to Saigon by the warship. Mr. Fei expressed great regret for the occurrence of this incident but stated that he had only come here from Paris a month and a half ago and felt very unfamiliar with handling this matter.

French Government Has Not Given Instructions

However, to this day, he has not yet received a notice from the French government regarding China's abolition of consular jurisdiction, nor has he received instructions from the French government on how to deal with French traitors in Shanghai. The Shanghai Office of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has lodged protests twice. Mr. Fei claimed that he felt caught in a dilemma. This reporter then asked Mr. Fei what measures he had to avoid the recurrence of such incidents. The French Consul stated: This is a one-time occurrence and will definitely be prohibited from happening again in the future to avoid damaging Sino-French relations. Yesterday morning, Chinese and English newspapers here all reported the ins and outs of the incident with large headlines. The French Consul believed that this was very fair reporting. In addition, this reporter asked Mr. Fei whether the rumors that the French side still retained several French traitors who had not been handed over to China were true. He strongly denied this, saying: The French side only arrested one French traitor, Kakebinopino.

### Six Ships Join the Voyage, Zhejiang-Fujian Shipping Is Smooth, Shanghai-Fujian Route Resumes Tomorrow

The National Ship Allocation Committee has now opened a new Zhejiang-Fujian shipping route. A total of six ships are responsible for sailing on this route, each with a carrying capacity of approximately 700 tons, totaling approximately 4,000 tons. As for shipping between Shanghai and Fuzhou, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will have the "Yinxian" and "Zhoushan" vessels, which originally sailed to Fuzhou, change their routes to Fuzhou in order to transport local goods from Fuzhou to Shanghai. The first departure is scheduled for tomorrow.

Salvaging the "Minyu"

At the end of last year, more than sixty American warships came to Shanghai to spend the New Year. At midnight on New Year's Eve and early on New Year's Day, they joined more than one hundred original resident warships to celebrate the New Year. It is learned that the warships successively left the port starting on the morning of the 3rd and sailed to the Bohai Sea and the South Seas to be stationed. Salvaging of the "Minyu" vessel began yesterday, and it can be salvaged within three to five days and then repaired at the dock. The Taikoo Company's "Wanliu" ship joined our country's restoration voyage after the victory. This time, it transported municipal government personnel from Chongqing to Beijing and is about to come to Shanghai, but the sailing date is uncertain. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Jiangshun" vessel berthed in Shanghai yesterday and is scheduled to sail to Hankou tomorrow morning, carrying relief supplies without passengers or cargo. The "Jiangping" vessel sailed upstream this morning, transporting 850 tons of coal from Qinhuangdao for transfer to Hankou. The "Changjiang" vessel will also sail to Hankou tomorrow morning. The repaired "Huayuan" is also scheduled to sail to Yichang tomorrow morning. Both vessels have a large amount of cotton yarn and piece goods to be transported to Yichang.

### Foreign Ships Transporting Relief Supplies, Associations Telegraph to Request a Halt

Recently, the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration reached an agreement with foreign shipping companies to transport relief supplies. The three labor unions of Marine Engineers, Drivers, and Seamen were very surprised after learning about this. They believed that maritime rights were not easy to recover, and if they were lost once, it would not only affect rights but also international relations. The three labor unions especially went to the Shipping Association yesterday to describe the matter. The association then convened a meeting of various organizing committee members for discussion. After deliberation, it was decided to send a telegram to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Communications, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, hoping to respect maritime rights regarding entrusting foreign merchant ships to transport goods, stop the previous proposal, and instead use Chinese ships for transportation.

### Five Batches of Japanese Prisoners of War Leave Shanghai Today

According to recent statistics, there are still a small number of Korean youths among the Japanese prisoners of war in the Beijing-Shanghai area. According to reporters' inquiries yesterday, the relevant parties are planning to find a house to serve as a concentration place for this batch of Korean youths.

### China Technical Association Plans to Hold Industrial Products Exhibition

The China Technical Association held a general meeting at the China Science Society at 3 PM yesterday and invited all directors of national industrial associations to discuss preparations for holding the Shanghai Industrial Products Exhibition. It was decided that it would close on the first day of next month. The preparatory office is located at No. 103, Lane 591, Jing'an Temple Road.

### Aviation Political Department Holds Air Force Photo Exhibition

### Hu Xiyuan Discusses Unity in the Industrial Sector, There Should Be a Distinction in Foreign Exchange Settlement Prices

[Report from Our Newspaper] Mr. Xiyuan, who has been engaged in the industrial sector for 20 years, established factories in the rear during the Anti-Japanese War and made great contributions to the country. This time he returned to Shanghai and was well-received by all parties. According to Mr. Hu, Shanghai's various factories should quickly resume work to reduce the serious unemployment problem. The factories in the rear were established to assist in the Anti-Japanese War, and collapsed one after another due to the sudden arrival of victory. The government should take on the responsibility of economic relief to solve their difficulties and enable these loyal industrialists to re-participate in future industrial construction. Chinese industry is not divided into front and rear; it is a whole, and should not be divided again to reduce strength. The process of industrialization is extremely difficult, and the national industrial sector should work together to develop it. If various environmental conditions cannot be coordinated, it is impossible to seek the independent prosperity of a factory. The issue of foreign exchange settlement prices is related to the life and death of the industrial sector. The Chongqing industrial sector has invited experts to discuss and discuss this matter many times, and they all believe that there should be a distinction in foreign exchange settlement prices for import and export and machine purchases. Because China's industry is immature, it is necessary to adopt special methods. As for foreign investment, cooperation, and technical cooperation, most Chinese industrialists have expressed their support, but they hope that the government will give strong support. I am the director of the National Industrial Restoration Committee. Once Shanghai's industry has been restored and developed again, I will go to other ports or return to Chongqing to report.

### Relief and Rehabilitation Ships Continue to Transport Large Quantities of Supplies, Large Quantities of Flour Will Be Arriving Soon

Shanghai Branch Distributes Old Clothes

A batch of old clothes automatically donated by people from the United States, Canada, Australia, and other places, including men's, women's, and children's clothing, has arrived in this port. Because these old clothes are donated, they are specifically for direct use by refugees and cannot be sold for cash. After the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration allocated part of them to the Shanghai branch for distribution to various charitable organizations, they were used to meet the winter needs of refugees. As of now, 630 bags have been distributed, each bag weighing 100 pounds. Most of them are distributed in their original bags. The organizations that received the old clothes include the Catholic Xinpu Zhutang, the Christian Orphanage, the Shanghai Disaster Children's Education Center, the Shanghai Poor Children's Home, the Salvation Army, and more than 50 other units.

Regarding the sale of flour, the reporter raised three questions, all of which were answered one by one. In addition, there were also inquiries about the detention of Yangtze River ships and the prevention of corruption and fraud.

### Traitor Yang Jichang Sentenced to Life Imprisonment Yesterday

During the enemy-puppet era, Yang Jichang, who served as a police officer in the enemy's North Station Gendarmerie, not only arbitrarily embezzled all kinds of daily necessities from compatriots during inspections but also wantonly abused women, earning him the nickname "Demon of the North Station." After the Japanese surrender, Yang attempted to evade justice until mid-October of last year, when he was reported, arrested, and handed over to the city's gendarmerie. After being transferred to the High Procuratorate and found guilty, he was prosecuted by the High Court under Article 2 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors. The High Court opened and concluded the trial twice. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, Chief Judge Liu Yugui, Judge Cao Jun, and Prosecutor Xia Lusheng entered the court in succession.

Traitor Jiang insisted that he had benefited the families of the workers. Zuo Ming, however, denied ever serving as a translator. Witness Ling Hu and others testified in court, proving that Zuo was indeed a translator for the Yamakyu Yoko company and that when the workers were unwilling to board the trucks and ships, Zuo even notified the enemy gendarmerie by telephone to send soldiers to escort the workers onto the trucks. Finally, Zuo requested the summons of two Japanese witnesses. The court ruled that the original case was still pending deliberation, scheduled a retrial, and returned Jiang and Zuo to custody. Shen Anfa's application for bail was granted.

### Telephone Lines in Terrible Condition. Telecommunications Bureau Investigates Users. Deadline for Reporting with Waistband by the 10th of the Month

[This Newspaper's Report] Yu Bingjian, Director of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, has been rectifying the bureau since taking over. According to Mr. Zhong:

Commercial Telephone Repairs Temporarily Difficult to Complete

Since taking over the China Telecommunications Company from the enemy, this bureau has been actively reorganizing. However, because the telephone lines in various places have been in disrepair for a long time, they are unusable, and sometimes calls are difficult to complete. The reasons are as follows: (1) After the enemy forcibly occupied the Shanghai Telephone Bureau, they never repaired the telephone lines of the various bureaus for eight years, and the lines in various places are in terrible condition, causing frequent breakdowns. (2) Currently, due to a lack of communication materials, in addition to prioritizing the repair of telephones for military and government agencies, other commercial telephones are also being repaired one by one. However, the lines in various places are too damaged, and it may be difficult to complete the repairs completely in a short time.

Japanese Telephone Accounts Should Be Transferred Immediately

(3) Many users in the city have inherited telephones from Japanese personnel. According to regulations, they should go through the procedures for transferring accounts or installing connections, but they have not done so. Some have even moved the installations privately. However, the lines of these Japanese users have long been disconnected by this bureau, and they will not be reconnected without going through formal procedures. They are ignorant of the reasons, resulting in misunderstandings. (4) A small number of users in this city still do not know how to use the bureau's telephones, resulting in frequent inability to get through. However, when tested by this bureau, the lines are in good condition. According to regulations, when making calls within the various areas under the jurisdiction of this bureau, users only need to wait for the dial tone to directly dial the number. When making calls to users of the Shanghai Telephone Company, they can also automatically transfer the call. Under the control of the user, after hearing the dial tone in the receiver, first dial the number (0), and then wait for the dial tone of the Shanghai Telephone Company before dialing the desired number. If the two numbers are dialed continuously without waiting for the dial tone, users will inevitably fail to get through or connect to the wrong number. (5) When users of the Shanghai Telephone Company call telephones in the various areas under the jurisdiction of this bureau (i.e., telephones transferred from the "02" number), the calls are transferred by the operators of the Shanghai Telephone Company. The two bureaus rely on manual transfer in the middle, which often causes difficulties. This bureau has recently received much criticism, which is not the fault of this bureau.

Must Fill Out Form, Otherwise Phone Service Will Be Disconnected

(6) This bureau is currently reorganizing telephone users, investigating equipment, and transferring information to benefit users. All users who have received the telephone user investigation form should quickly send the completed form to the Business Section of this bureau on the third floor of No. 872 North Sichuan Road. If you currently have a telephone installed by this bureau but have not received the investigation form, please immediately request the form from the Business Section of this bureau to fill it out and submit it. If the investigation form has not been submitted by January 10, 1946, this bureau will consider that you do not need to continue the telephone service, and the telephone will be removed. (7) If users' telephones have malfunctions, dial (60060) for numbers beginning with (6), dial (70060) for numbers beginning with (7), dial (82060) for numbers beginning with (8), and dial (50060) for numbers beginning with (5) to notify the measuring stations, which can immediately test and send personnel to repair them. If you have not completed the formal procedures after the bureau took over, you must register with the Business Section of this bureau and pay the fees in order to be reconnected.

### Preferential Treatment for National Army to View Plays: Movie Theaters Negotiate Methods; Plan to Rotate One Show Per Week Per Theater

[This Newspaper's Report] The movie theaters in this city have formulated considerable methods for preferential treatment for the National Army to view plays. According to Mr. Li Diyun, the general manager of Dahua Theater and the representative of the theaters, the theater authorities are very sympathetic to the hard work of the National Army during the eight-year war of resistance and their urgent need to obtain entertainment. They have repeatedly negotiated free methods with the British Eight Film Company. However, the film merchants firmly oppose free admission to the first-run films. The representatives also stated that if the theaters must provide free admission to the first-run films, the film merchants may stop supplying films here and withdraw the films that have already been distributed.

The method currently recommended by the theaters is to divide the forty-odd large and small theaters in the city into four groups of ten theaters each, totaling about one hundred seats each, distributed according to location. Each group will take turns providing free admission to the National Army one show per week, which means that each theater will provide free admission once per month on average. Colonel Wang, Deputy Director of the General Headquarters of the Songhu Garrison, also expressed his support for this proposal at the meeting of theater representatives yesterday. The National Army hopes to view plays at 12:00 noon every Sunday. The theaters plan to provide free admission every Saturday noon, with free tickets issued in advance. The National Army will be led by the commanding officer to the theater in order.

Mr. Li also scheduled to convene representatives of the theaters today to discuss everything and make a final decision. If the film merchants still insist that free admission is not allowed, the theaters may consider paying a considerable price to purchase the films for the National Army to view for free. If the film merchants can agree to all points, the above method can be implemented for a long time.

According to Mr. Howard, the U.S. Deputy Consul in Shanghai, the inability of the U.S. film merchants to agree to provide free plays to the National Army is also a last resort. British and American soldiers must also purchase tickets to go to the theaters. The National Army's treatment is lower, and a written proposal has been submitted to the military and government authorities to open the Hongkou district, where the municipal government can take over the theaters from the Japanese and the film merchants can supply second-run films for screening. Once the municipal authorities make a decision, it can be implemented.

### My Opinion on Maintaining Order in Theaters

‚Äî Hao Shuicun

After reading the article "Who Maintains Order in Theaters" in the Shanghai Shen Bao's Free Discussion section on December 27, I was stirred to share some of my thoughts.

First of all, I want to declare to the readers that I am a soldier, and I am not in Shanghai but in Hangzhou. To prevent the issue of theater order from escalating in the future, I would like to analyze the causes of the conflict from a soldier's perspective and offer my humble opinions:

First, let's talk about the military side.

Mr. Junyang said, "Our soldiers indeed lack entertainment. There is simply no opera or movies to watch in the battalion, so they have to go to various theaters outside to seek entertainment." This is absolutely correct.

First, generally speaking, the officers have a very low level of knowledge. Besides fighting battles, exercising, and performing duties, their only forms of entertainment are gambling, whoring, or watching opera (they only know how to watch but not listen) and movies. Because they don't have colorful movies provided by the military every week like the American soldiers, or occasional dances. Apart from the political instructors telling them jokes and stories, the only way to pass the time in the barracks is to gamble secretly in groups of three or five, or find "lovers" near the garrison. But we all know that their treatment is quite poor, and their monthly income is very limited. They run out of money in three to five days, so how can they afford to "gamble" or pay to find "lovers"? Therefore, in this depressed environment, they cannot stay in the barracks. They have no chance to go out during the day, and they always want to find a chance to vent at night. There is no other way but to go to the lively Peking opera theater.

Second, it cannot be denied that the officers have some "arrogance." They always think that during the war of resistance, they shed blood and sweat, risking their lives to fight. Now that the Japanese devils have been defeated, it is naturally mostly due to the soldiers' efforts, and the common people should be more polite to the officers. Therefore, they feel uncomfortable when the people show them any slight disrespect and start to "get angry," leading to disagreements and even drawing swords.

Third, Shanghai is a place that makes people "panic." During the war of resistance, the officers mostly came into contact with places full of bomb craters, bullet marks, and desolate valleys, where there were more stones than people. They have tasted the hardships long ago. Now, they have survived by chance and come to this dazzling and eye-catching Shanghai, and they naturally become even wilder. As the saying goes, "Out of sight, out of mind." They have been sent to Shanghai, and their task is naturally to perform duties and guard the area. They probably don't even exercise during the day. If they have nothing to do, they will naturally want to go out for a stroll. But their pockets are empty, so where can they go? They are not qualified to go to dance halls, and they don't have money to go to restaurants, so they can only drool. They wander around on the streets without any ideas and end up listening to the loud drums and cymbals and watching the "stars" on stage to cheer them on. As a result, there are more and more officers in the theater.

Fourth, their treatment is too poor. Shanghai people probably don't know much about the poorest stage of soldiers. As for how poor it is, Shanghai people have never seen it, so we don't need to talk about it. Now, let's just talk about the "new salary" system: a soldier's salary is only a little over 1,200 yuan. According to Shanghai's prices, they have a maximum of only 400 to 500 yuan left each month after paying for food. Readers, think about it, what else can they buy besides soap for washing clothes and secretly smoking cigarettes? How can they afford to buy theater tickets? According to the rules, theaters are businesses, and if one or two people don't buy tickets, won't the theater operators have to starve? Therefore, in this contradictory situation, there are more and more problems.

Let's talk about the theater side:

First, people in Shanghai have always looked down on officers in "two-and-a-half-foot" uniforms and even despise them. To put it seriously, they simply "hate" them. Readers, don't think that I am exaggerating. I have facts to prove it.

I have a friend who went to a shoe store on Nanjing Road in Shanghai to buy leather shoes. He was wearing a gray military uniform and a small narrow belt (this was the wartime regulation that officers were not allowed to wear military belts). At first glance, he looked like a private (but he was actually a major). As soon as he entered the door, the clerks cast strange glances at him. When he said he wanted to see the goods, the clerks were reluctant to move and said indifferently, "These cost more than 10,000 legal tender!" My friend was a little offended, "What if it costs more than 10,000?" He was a little impatient. Then one of the clerks said, "I meant that the ones that cost 5,000 to 6,000 yuan are more economical for you soldiers." So that friend actually walked away. As soon as he walked out of the store, he heard one of the clerks inside say, "He's not here to buy leather shoes, he's just taking the opportunity to have some fun." He was a little angry when he heard this, but he finally endured it.

Second, most people in Shanghai are "tailor's eyes" (i.e., silk eyes), especially when they see people wearing dirty and old gray military uniforms. Furthermore, speaking with "thorns" is also the biggest cause of conflict. For example, the beating of Mr. Gu at the Victory Theater last time is the most obvious example. His first sentence, "We are all Chinese," was obviously a bit unpleasant. The second sentence, "It's not worth showing it to Japanese residents." These words with "thorns" are the biggest cause of conflict. It is often said that "A man lives for a breath, and a Buddha lives for a stick of incense." In public, why use these words with "thorns," which is equivalent to tearing off their face? Readers, think about it, people want face, and trees want bark, let alone this group of armed brothers with "arrogance"?

Third, there is a lack of preferential treatment for soldiers. We say preferential treatment, not giving them free shows every day, but that they should be treated with some consideration, and some extra seats should be set aside so that they also have the opportunity to have fun. No matter how you put it, you can't erase their more than eight years of hard work. It seems that the theater side has overlooked this point, and the local authorities have not noticed it either.

We have already pointed out the difficulties regarding the military and the theater, but naturally it is not complete. Here, I would like to supplement Mr. Junyang and think of a way to maintain order in the theater. Although this method is not clever enough and not thorough enough, I still hope that both the military and the theater can give it a try.

The Chinese people have always done things based on experience. They will never know how to improve without learning lessons from experience. Now, let's not talk about theories for the time being, but just focus on reality:

It is certainly not a solution for the person in charge of the theater to always be beaten; however, it is even worse for the soldiers to lose their temper and hit people. But if the theater side demands that the authorities "shut out" the soldiers for fear of being beaten, it is even more unreasonable, and it will cause problems that are many times more serious than beating people.

As for how serious it is, I am not intentionally "alarmist." Shanghai people have not yet experienced it, but people who run theaters in the rear areas know it, and have even tasted it. We believe that before the government completely solves the problem of soldiers' entertainment, I still hope that the people in charge of various theaters in Shanghai will not underestimate this point. At the same time, do not ask the local authorities to impose "heavy pressure" on the soldiers. Everyone should try to solve it from the root.

First, each theater should try to set up preferential seats for soldiers:

Theaters in the interior have this method. The so-called preferential seats are not to let them sit in the orchestra, but on the "side seats" on both sides of the theater, or the "balconies" upstairs. In this way, although the theater may suffer some losses, it will certainly be easier to maintain order in terms of business and theater order.

Second, "daytime shows" should be performed on Sundays:

Generally, soldiers will go out on leave on Sundays. It is not harmful to perform for them on Sundays, but the plays performed should not be too perfunctory. The theater bosses should try their best to explain the meaning of entertaining the soldiers to the actors.

Third, the attitude of the theater staff should be polite:

The "tailor's eyes" of the theater staff are absolutely undesirable. I am not saying that they should be obsequious to the soldiers, but that everyone should at least nod to each other when they meet the soldiers, and the attitude should be more peaceful.

Fourth, the troops must strictly control the soldiers and not allow such a small matter to erase our great achievements of eight years of hard work in the eyes of the people of Shanghai. There must be restrictions on the number of people who go out on Sundays, holidays, or every night. They must take turns to go, and there must be officers or squad leaders in charge.

Fifth, the uniforms must be neat, and the insignia, armbands, and belts must not be missing. When you go to the theater, you must go to the designated preferential seats for soldiers. Absolutely do not sit around indiscriminately to disrupt the theater order and be criticized by the society.

In this way, I believe that the order of the theater can be maintained and will slowly improve.

These are my humble opinions, and I write them based on facts, without adding any high-sounding theories. We hope to try it out and offer it to the military authorities and theaters.

Animals

### Ants

‚Äî Wen Quan

Watching ants foraging is quite interesting.

Especially in the scorching summer, it is when these small animals are most busy working. When you are so lazy that you don't even feel like reading, then you might as well get up from your wicker chair and "appreciate" their work for a while. It will really make your spirits soar.

The strength of ants is indeed great. A single ant can pull things that are several times larger than itself; two or three pairs are enough to deal with dead flies. For larger things, they gather many companions, pushing and pulling from the front and back, and carry them into their "cave."

I like to use whole fresh shrimps or dead dragonflies to lure them and watch them come in a vast and orderly formation. Then, a tense situation unfolds. They wriggle and move around the object of interest and communicate with each other rapidly with their antennae. Here, they just work silently, without‰∫âÂ§∫, without laziness. They have only one goal‚Äîto work for the public and for the entire ant colony. In less than a few minutes, carrying this rich "prey," they slowly return in triumph with their concerted efforts.

Even small creatures like ants can thrive and multiply, isn't it entirely because of their ability to live in groups? This shows the value of cooperation and the greatness of collective strength. As humans, who are considered the "spirit of all things," how much can we compare to them? Pursuing selfish interests and engaging in power struggles are human habits. The "sincere unity" and "cooperation" that we proclaim are truly realized in the small animal ant colony. Compared to the working spirit of ants, can you not be ashamed?

Random Thoughts

### The Spiritual Food We Need

‚Äî Shi Xi

Nutrients in food include carbohydrates, fats, proteins, phosphorus, iron, calcium, and various vitamins. These nutrients keep our bodies healthy. Similarly, in the spiritual realm, I also need cultural food rich in nutrients to promote spiritual health.

I am a member of the liberated area yearning for spiritual food. The nutrients I need (perhaps you need them too) include the following:

First, writings that expose the ugly history of traitors and encourage loyalty:

What the people in the liberated area hate most is that the big and small traitors who are still at large. Their crimes are heinous; they assisted the wicked in their evildoing. For the sake of universal justice and national discipline, all sectors should unanimously denounce them. The ugly history of those unscrupulous big and small traitors and their behavior of harming loyal and good people should be nakedly depicted and ruthlessly criticized! The righteous spirit of the universe and the integrity of the nation should be praised, loyalty and goodness should be encouraged, corruption should be punished, and hypocrisy should be strictly dealt with. This will invigorate our spirits.

Second, constructive writings:

Today, after the war, is the beginning of reconstruction. We yearn for the revival of our motherland as if we are longing for timely rain during a severe drought. Theoretical writings and implementation plans, materials of all kinds, that are related to economic construction, transportation restoration, agricultural production increases... all kinds of constructive postwar writings are sufficient to increase my knowledge of construction.

Third, new knowledge about science:

Living in today's "atomic age," with the omnipotence and all-evil potential of science, we are inevitably threatened by some kind of "atomic" survival in the future. If we do not want to be backward in the times, then we should pay more attention to various issues related to the study of science, such as the exploration of "atomic energy," the recognition of new weapons, and the application of healthcare and medical science, etc. This progressive new knowledge of science will allow me and a group of fellow citizens who lack scientific knowledge to constantly absorb and digest these nutrients that enhance spiritual health.

Fourth, scientific methods for human survival and conquering nature:

How to reclaim wasteland, exploit resources, engage in large-scale agricultural production, hunt rare birds and animals, and various scientific methods for conquering nature should be contributed. Encouraging a creative life strengthens my new understanding of the world. I pray for such good articles.

In addition, those regulations that eliminate selfish concepts of contention between people, eliminate war, and create a peaceful and happy life. This type of writing is also much-needed spiritual food.

### Chongqing Snippets

‚Äî Mei Youyun

The most popular songs in the dance halls of Chongqing can recently be heard in the mouths of young people. "Flower-like dreams, dream-like flowers," they walk and dance, humming these charming sentences. From their intoxicated and infatuated state, you can know what influence this song has on these promising young people!

The price of "Shanghai Daily News of the Day" has been standardized from the chaotic prices of 300 and 250 yuan. Each copy is 200 yuan. There are four types: Shen, Xin, Dagong, and Zhengyan. They appear on the bustling streets of Chongqing at three or four o'clock every afternoon.

The business of Sichuan restaurants has been particularly good recently. People always feel some nostalgia for things that are about to be separated from. The "sunset" seems particularly beautiful.

The news of the Political Consultative Conference is too concerning. Every place with posted newspapers is crowded with people reading the news. Their tense faces fully show how much the people are expecting peace.

This year alone, a total of nine banks and silver firms in Chongqing have closed down or been ordered to suspend operations. Society is a melting pot, and dross cannot escape being eliminated.

Another year easily passes, and it is New Year's Eve again. Firecrackers all over the streets welcome the first municipal councilors elected by 300,000 voters. New history! New Year's Day! Everything is moving towards a new path. May the councilors remember what they said to the people during the election, bring out their spirit, and write a new glorious history for the new Chongqing! New Year's Eve, Year 34 in Chongqing

### Courteous Postal Worker

‚Äî Zhao Kuang

Recently, the Associated Press sent the following news item from Indianapolis, USA: "Mrs. Schtella, because she was too busy, mistakenly put three one-dollar war savings stamps as ordinary stamps on the upper right corner and put them into the printing machine.

"A clerk in the post office was particularly polite to her. He first helped her to remove the stamps, but he saw that since they had been stamped, they were no longer valid, so he transferred three new ones to her."

The American postal workers are so polite and considerate; their spirit of service is truly admirable!

### Mr. Wu and Son Generously Donate a Large Sum of Money; the Staff Respectfully Thank Them on Behalf of Needy Students

Yesterday, this newspaper received a donation of 1 million yuan in scholarships from "Mr. Wu and Son." When they personally delivered it, we asked them what their names were. They smiled and refused to reveal them. We asked them again about the motivation for the donation? They also refused to comment, only saying, "Doing good does not require much talk," and then left in a hurry. Looking at their demeanor, kind and respectful, it is evident that they are a sincere and faithful elder.

Regarding the scholarship funds that this newspaper has been praising and assisting with, it has been continuously conducted for the past four or five years, until the "Sino-American Basketball Game" was organized last month. We have always been unable to forget these two thousand four hundred and more adorable and outstanding young people! Recalling the beginning of each fundraising campaign, we always worried about the difficulty of raising funds, especially this time, the budget required is very large, even more difficult than before. After considering and considering, when the leaders are still in the midst of planning, in the next few days, we will report the decided direction to the readers, but in any case, we hope that all sectors will freely donate to complete the studies of more than two thousand young people. For the enthusiasm of "Mr. Wu and Son" in assisting education and benefiting the poor students, the staff of this newspaper respectfully extend their utmost gratitude!

### Beware of Fake Two Thousand Yuan Bills

‚Äî Jun

The other day on New Year's Eve, this bank discovered a fake 2,000 yuan legal tender bill in the cash delivered by a customer. The printing of the bill was blurred, and the color was more red than the green color of the genuine bill. In addition, the font of the number and the preceding English letters were larger and not neat. If compared to the genuine bill, there are many differences. This fake bill is circulating in the market, but it is not often seen. We hope that all sectors will pay attention. Furthermore, there are still shops in the market that refuse to accept customs gold with numbers on both sides. This statement is actually false, because all banks and businesses can accept and resolve it.

Letter from a Reader

### Inquiry About Daycare Centers

Dear Editor: We just came from the inland. Both of our parents work in government agencies. When our child was in Chongqing, he was entrusted to a daycare center. Now that we have arrived in Shanghai, we are unfamiliar with the place. I don't know if there are daycare centers in Shanghai? We live in Hongkou, and it would be even better if it was nearby. I am very sorry to bother you with these small matters and take up your time. I hope you can take the time to tell us in detail. Thank you very much. Zhi Shanghua bows

(Editor's Reply) For daycare matters, you can inquire at the Young Women's Christian Association at the intersection of Weihaiwei Road and Cangming Road.

### Draw Yellow Longitudinal Lines in the Fast Lane

To Whom It May Concern: The national vehicle traffic on the right has been implemented on New Year's Day this year. The competent authorities have done everything possible in advance to expand publicity to promote public attention and to modify traffic signs to ensure the safety of driving. Their painstaking efforts were originally intended to ensure the safety of the public. All citizens, of course, should be vigilant at all times, earnestly abide by it, and avoid causing trouble. However, since the implementation, vehicle accidents have been seen quite a few times. Although the reasons are different, drivers are stuck in habits and negligence is inevitable. When the error is discovered, it is too late. I deeply hope that the municipal authorities can draw uniform yellow longitudinal lines in the fast lane (except for those with tram tracks), so that vehicles coming and going can each travel on their own lanes, avoiding the danger of collisions on the road. Although the cost is not light, but for the safety of citizens, I think the wise authorities will definitely adopt or spy on more effective methods to reduce the occurrence of accidents. I can't help but add bridges to the fragrance. I have always admired your newspaper for serving the public. I urge you to publish the original letter so as to urge the authorities to pay attention, then I will be very fortunate. This is above the Shenbao Social Services Office. A reader respectfully sends this.
