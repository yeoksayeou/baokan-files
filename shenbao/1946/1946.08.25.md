### Meeting Between Chairman and Special Envoy Marshall - Exchanging Views on the Current Peace Issues - Also Discussing the Restructuring of the Government

[Special Dispatch from Kuling by Our Newspaper on the 24th] Special Envoy Marshall and his wife visited the Chairman at the official residence at 11:00 AM on the 24th, the first meeting after their fifth trip to Kuling. They also had lunch with the Chairman and his wife. It is reported that Special Envoy Marshall and the Chairman exchanged views on the current peace issues, the content of which has not been announced. According to some people here, as long as the Communist Party can abide by the Chairman's August 14th statement, withdrawing from key strongholds that threaten important transportation lines (i.e., the Tianjin-Pukou Railway) and northern Jiangsu, peace negotiations can continue. Special Envoy Marshall's plane has arrived in Xunyang, and he will return to Nanjing in a day or two.

[Dispatch from Nanjing by Our Newspaper on the 24th] Recent peace talks in Nanjing have discussed specific issues, namely the restructuring of the government and the ceasefire, but without results. The government is quite determined to proactively restructure the government. When Special Envoy Marshall was in Kuling before, he had in-depth exchanges of views with Chairman Chiang on this issue and also telegraphed Zhou Enlai, asking the Communist Party to submit a list of participants in the government. After Special Envoy Marshall returned to Nanjing from Lushan, the three parties, the Nationalists, the Communists, and the Americans, held a series of talks. The Communist Party expressed that it did not refuse to discuss the restructuring of the government. However, the issues such as the President's veto power were far apart from the government's views. Furthermore, the Communist Party stated that the restructuring of the government must be based on an unconditional ceasefire, that is, without discussing the five requirements related to stationing issues previously proposed by the government. The talks stopped there. It is reported that Marshal Marshall's fifth visit to Lushan was to convey this view of the Communist Party to Chairman Chiang and to negotiate with him.

[Dispatch from Nanjing by Our Newspaper on the 24th] Peace negotiations became quiet due to Marshal Marshall's trip to Lushan. Ambassador Stuart spent the entire day on the 24th without any political meetings.

[Dispatch from Nanjing by the United Press on the 24th] Special Envoy Marshall is thinking of formulating a feasible plan to establish a National Government Committee that accommodates all parties, with a total of 40 members. Ambassador Stuart believes that the whole issue should be set aside, and the war should be completely stopped first, so as to complete the national ceasefire and produce the National Government Committee.

[Dispatch from Nanjing by Agence France-Presse on the 24th] According to American sources, Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart are currently carrying out the work of reorganizing the Chinese government. Special Envoy Marshall firmly advocates that the National Government Committee should be established immediately. This is the first time that Marshall and Stuart have directly dealt with the political aspects of the peace issue. The biggest goal of Special Envoy Marshall's five trips to Kuling is to get Chairman Chiang to establish the National Government Committee. This institution was decided by the Political Consultative Conference to replace the Supreme National Defense Council. At the same time, Ambassador Stuart is currently preparing to establish a five-member committee to seek the resumption of peace talks. In addition to the ambassador himself, the committee will include two representatives each from the government and the Communist Party of China. Communist leaders Zhou Enlai and Dong Biwu have agreed in principle to participate in the negotiations. However, the government has not yet appointed representatives. Wang Bingnan, a spokesman for the Communist Party of China, told an Agence France-Presse reporter today that there are only two issues currently awaiting resolution: (1) an unconditional ceasefire; and (2) the restructuring of the government in accordance with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. If these principles can be implemented, the future of China will truly become bright. If the rock is not moved away, the door cannot be opened.

### Communist Army Disregards Heavy Sacrifices - Reattacking Datong Unsuccessfully - The National Army Defending the City Bravely Counterattacks

[Dispatch from Nanjing by Our Newspaper on the 24th] The Communist army is trying to seize Datong, disregarding heavy sacrifices. Now He Long has personally led his 7th Field Brigade, totaling about 1,000 people, with tanks, and arrived at Leigong, about 10 kilometers northwest of Datong, on the 17th via Fengxian. In addition, the main force of Xiao Ke's infantry, more than 30,000, is also moving from western Rehe towards Datong.

[Dispatch from Nanjing by Our Newspaper on the 24th] The battles on the outskirts of Datong are still very fierce.

The Communist army recently reinforced more than 10,000 people from Yanggao, with more than ten mountain guns and more than twenty mortars, and gathered at Shili Pu, Fanjiagang, and other places east of Datong. They joined the Communist army on the outskirts of Datong and launched another attack. Since the morning of the 20th, the Communist army, under the cover of artillery fire, launched fierce attacks from the east of Datong towards the strongholds of Shachen, Shuiquanwan, and Beiyue Temple, resulting in fierce battles. It was not until the morning of the next day that they were repelled. The Communist army on the north side simultaneously surrounded the National Army strongholds such as the Alcohol Company, Flour Company, and Police School, and launched wave-like charges with dense troops, up to seven times. The National Army fought to the death and finally repelled them. Another unit of about 1,000 people, with three mountain guns, launched fierce attacks from Wohuwan and Baimacheng north of the city on the National Army strongholds at the northern end of the station. After the National Army's brave counterattack, their momentum was slightly frustrated, and they are still confronting each other. More than 2,000 Communist troops have been increased to Shili Dian in the west of the city, and a battle is about to unfold. In addition, in a certain regiment of the Communist army attacking Shachen, the soldiers, due to war-weariness, killed their regimental and battalion commanders and abandoned their weapons and fled.

### Zuo Shunsheng Discusses Government Reorganization Issues in Shanghai

[Dispatch from this city by the Central News Agency] Hui Qi, leader of the Youth Party, went to Kuling to spend the summer. After returning to Nanjing, he suffered from a cold due to climate maladjustment. He arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing the night before and continued to recuperate. When the reporter visited Mr. Zeng yesterday, he happened to be out seeking medical treatment and did not get an interview. Later, Mr. Zuo Shunsheng received the reporter and talked about the current situation. Mr. Zuo believes that a ceasefire must be achieved first to realize peace, and then a thorough solution can be sought through political means. On this point, he quite agrees with the seven propositions put forward by the "China Times" editorial on August 19 on the issue of reorganizing the government: (1) The nationalization of the army and the democratization of politics should be carried out simultaneously in order to gradually achieve the expected goal; (2) the first priority is a ceasefire in northern Jiangsu; (3) after a ceasefire is truly achieved in northern Jiangsu, the Communist army should automatically withdraw from northern Jiangsu into Shandong. At the same time, both sides should announce a comprehensive ceasefire; (4) the transportation issue should be jointly handled by a committee composed of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, or with the addition of other parties and experts. The troops of both sides should withdraw from the railway line for a distance of a thousand miles, and a period of time should be stipulated to focus only on commercial and civilian transportation and temporarily not transport troops; (5) after the second, third, and fourth points have been truly achieved, the reorganization of the government should begin in accordance with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference; (6) the first task of the reorganized government is to thoroughly reorganize the army in accordance with the army reorganization plan agreed upon by both sides; (7) the work to be carried out simultaneously after the government is reorganized is to re-examine the draft constitution and convene the National Assembly.

### Communist Army Relies on Fortifications to Resist Stubbornly - Street Fighting Unfolds in Shaobo Town - National Army on the Outskirts of Xuzhou Recovers Pei County

[Dispatch from Jiangdu by Our Newspaper on the 24th] On the Grand Canal Line, there was fierce fighting all day today. The Communist army in Shaobo received reinforcements of more than 1,000 people from Gaoyou at 11:00 PM last night. Relying on fortifications, they continued to resist stubbornly. They once rushed into the town. The National Army immediately retreated to defend along the town river. The two armies confronted each other. The fierce fighting started again at dawn today. The National Army exerted the power of its artillery, and the Communist army suffered heavy casualties. However, the rivers and streams there are crisscrossed, and the Communist army has an advantage in terms of terrain. With continued reinforcements, they insisted on not retreating. At 2:00 PM, the National Army gunboats fired artillery from Shaobo Lake, followed by landing. The National Army on the east side also broke through the Communist army's positions after a fierce battle and rushed into the position again. The National Army on the front also took advantage of the situation to attack from Dawang Temple, and the three National Armies engaged in street fighting with the Communist army, which continued until late at night.

[Dispatch from Jiangdu by Our Newspaper on the 23rd] The battle in northern Jiangsu has begun. The National Army was forced to launch a counterattack against the Communist army threatening Yangzhou. At 5:30 this morning, they launched an attack from near Tanu Temple in two routes. The people along the way spontaneously assisted, and they were invincible. The right wing took Qiaoshu as its primary target and recovered it at around 11:00 AM after a brief battle. More than 200 Communist troops in the town surrendered and were captured, and there were also many casualties. The National Army suffered only a dozen or so casualties. The left wing advanced swiftly, and it was not until they approached the outskirts of Shaobo that they encountered strong resistance from the Communist army. The Communist army did not have sufficient firepower, but its fortifications were strong and it still tried to resist stubbornly. The National Army has surrounded Shaobo on three sides. According to a telegram from Xiannu Temple at 9:00 PM, the National Army has entered Shaobo Town, and the Communist army's resistance has been broken.

### Communist Army in Northern Jiangsu Expands the Flood Area of the Grand Canal Again

[Dispatch from Nanjing by Our Newspaper on the 24th] The Communist army expanded the flooded area of the Daguo River near Zhaoduo in northern Jiangsu again on the 21st, extending south to the Bachalu area 14 kilometers south of the railway and north to the Jiakouwei area 10 kilometers north of the railway, expanding by about 30 kilometers, with a water depth of 3 to 4 feet.

[Dispatch from Nanjing by Our Newspaper on the 24th] According to a Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Huaiyin on the 23rd, the water level of the Grand Canal is rising rapidly. As of the 18th, the water level in Qingjiang has reached 2 zhang 6 chi 6 cun, and it is still rising. The dispatch also stated that if the Langjiang and Guashan dams in the Guijiang Dam could be opened, the disaster could be avoided. According to relevant sources, the water situation in the area was clearly caused by the military breaching the dikes. Since the dam is in the Communist-controlled area of Gaoyou, how can the government be blamed? Moreover, the dam is as high as 1 zhang 8 chi, and the Guijiang Dam had already been opened long ago. How can it still be claimed that the government has not opened it, causing a major disaster?

### Situation in Northeast Becomes Tense Again - Lin Biao Instructs the Communist Army to Actively Prepare for War - Two Contact Points on the Rehe Railway Line

[Dispatch from Beiping by Our Newspaper on the 24th] Changchun News: The situation in the Northeast is becoming increasingly tense. The Communist army is actively preparing for war, and the National Army on the China Changchun Railway is also strengthening its defenses. The Changchun-Shenyang area is carrying out clean-up work. The Communist troops in Jilin, Jiaohe, Dunhua, Liangjiangkou, Jiapigou, and other places are said to be mixed with troops from a certain side. Their equipment is the same as the Communist army. The Communist army has recently received a large amount of weapons and supplies. Zhao Shangzhi's and Feng Dang's troops have 40 long-range guns, light and heavy machine guns, and trucks. The mountains in Liangjiangkou and Jiapigou are all fortified and the public is strictly prohibited from passing through. It is rumored that Lin Biao recently instructed the Communist army in the Northeast to establish three base areas: "Manchuria-Korea," "Manchuria-Soviet," and "Manchuria-Mongolia," to prepare transportation, warehouses, weapons, food, clothing, and airfield facilities. Tyson, the American representative of the Changchun Branch of the Military Mediation Department, flew to Harbin on the 23rd to meet with Lin Biao to ease this tense situation.

[Dispatch from Beiping by Our Newspaper on the 24th] Transportation News: Tieling, between Siping and Shenyang, was surrounded by the Communist army on the east, west, and north sides on the evening of the 23rd.

[Dispatch from Beiping by the Central News Agency on the 24th] The government representative of the Chengde 11th Team of the Military Mediation Department, Yue Changchou, and the US representative, Lewis May, returned to Beiping on the 23rd.

### Director Deng Reports to Reporters on the Situation of Conflicts in Various Places

[Dispatch from Nanjing by Our Newspaper on the 24th] At a press conference held by the News Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense on the 24th, Director Deng Wenyi reported on the situation of the conflicts and answered questions from reporters. A reporter asked about the strength of the Kuomintang and Communist forces. Deng said that the National Army currently has only 3 million troops, while the Xinhua Daily claims that the Communist army has 15 million. Last month, Chen Yi also told Commander Wang that 500,000 people would reinforce Jinan. Wang replied that soldiers are valued for their quality, not quantity. Deng then said that the Communist army actually has only 600,000 people. In the past, Germany had 10 million troops and Japan had 50 million, but neither of them won. This shows that soldiers are valued for their quality, not quantity. Someone asked how long this war would last. Deng said that it would not last too long. He then said, "You are all young and can watch the changes quietly." Everyone smiled. Finally, Deng told reporters that he would try his best to facilitate the release of information on the war situation to the reporters in the future, and agreed to consider the request of the reporters to go to northern Jiangsu to observe the war.

[Dispatch from Nanjing by the Central News Agency on the 24th] The News Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense held a tea party for the press at the Lizhi Society at 4:00 PM on the 24th, hosted by Director Deng Wenyi. He outlined the situation of the conflicts in various places and answered many questions. He declared that the Communist army is actively preparing for a counterattack in northern Jiangsu, and has transferred more than 20,000 troops from Xu Xiangqian's unit from Shandong and 70,000 to 80,000 troops from Liu Bocheng's unit from the Longhai Railway, claiming to "support northern Jiangsu." It seems that there will be a fierce battle soon. In the Xuzhou area, after the recovery of Xishan and Huangkou, the Communist army approaching Xuzhou has been driven far away. He also pointed out that the Communist army on the outskirts of Xuzhou not only has Japanese equipment, but also has Japanese prisoners serving as machine gunners and gunners. On the Longhai Railway, Lanfeng was recovered at 2:00 PM on the 22nd. Of Liu Bocheng's 31 regiments, 13 have been devastated by this battle. In the Shanxi area, Datong is still being bravely defended by the National Army. Deng received a telegram from the political department of the defending army in the city with the words "have confidence." In the Shandong area, the Communist army has not given up its attempt to attack Qingdao. As for the Communist army of about 2,000 people on the border of Sichuan and Shaanxi, they wanted to flee to northern Shaanxi but have been cut off by the National Army. Overall, the center of the war is gradually shifting to northern Jiangsu, and the Communist army's conspiracy to breach the dikes to stop the National Army has become a bubble due to the receding water. They are transferring troops from Dalian to Shandong to reinforce northern Jiangsu, concentrating on Huaiyin. Their intention is nothing more than to occupy northern Jiangsu as a pretext for negotiation. Director Deng also denounced the atrocities of the Communist army, saying that since the Communist army launched the war, they have forced men and women aged 15 to 45 in the "Liberated Areas" to participate in the war or transport supplies. They forced the people to go to the front to consume the National Army's ammunition, with extremely sinister intentions. The people have no fighting power and flee as soon as they take to the battlefield. People in the old course of the Yellow River along the Longhai Railway have mostly fled as a result, and have nowhere to return. The Communist army's tortures are also endless, such as "dismemberment by five horses" and pouring hot lime water on people and making them stand in it. According to refugees who escaped from the "Liberated Areas," "The people hate the Communist army to the extreme, and are also extremely afraid of them," because they are killed at every turn. However, extremes will turn into their opposites. Recently, people in various places in western Shandong have spontaneously organized to resist the Communist army. More than 10,000 people in Yutai County rose up to defend their homes, fought with the Communist army who ravaged the area, and killed more than 400 Communist troops. More than 10,000 people in the neighboring county of Jinxiang rose up to respond. At this moment, the movement of refugees in Shandong to arm themselves and return home is developing increasingly, and the direction of people's hearts can be seen from this. "The government still hopes that the Communist Party will pull back from the brink. If they still insist on going their own way, it is truly regrettable," he concluded his report with this.

### Democratic League Members Zhang Junmai and Zhang Dongshen Are Organizing the Democratic Socialist Party; Jiang Yuntian Discusses the Party's Basic Platform

[Central News Agency Dispatch from this City] Zhang Junmai and Zhang Dongshen, members of the Democratic League, are merging the National Socialist Party, which they lead, with the Overseas Democratic Constitutionalist Party to form the Democratic Socialist Party. An organizing committee has been established, with Zhang Junmai, Zhang Dongshen, Wu Xianzi, Li Daming, Xu Chuanlin, and Tang Zhuxin responsible for overseeing the process. A declaration and platform will be released within days. Yesterday, this reporter specifically visited Jiang Yuntian, spokesperson for the party, to inquire about the process of forming the party and its basic platform. Mr. Jiang discussed:

The Process of Forming the Party

He said that the Democratic Constitutionalist Party was established in the late Qing Dynasty. Its predecessor was the Baohuang Party (Protect the Emperor Party) organized by Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao. Its members were overseas Chinese, and its headquarters were located in Seattle, USA. After Liang Qichao passed away, the party was led by Xu Qin, and later by Wu Xianzi, until now. The basic political platforms of this party and the National Socialist Party have always been very close. Last year, when Mr. Zhang Junmai went to the United States to attend the San Francisco Conference, after discussions between the leaders of the two parties, the idea of merging and reorganizing was proposed. Recently, Li Daming of the Democratic Constitutionalist Party returned to China, and after concrete discussions, it was decided to jointly form the Social Democratic Party. In addition to the original members of the two parties, some members of the Zhi Gong Party and respected members of society also participated. (Situ Meitang did not join.) As for the relationship between this party and the Democratic League after its formation, it will not be formally decided until a general meeting of representatives of this party is convened in three months. Currently, a cooperative relationship is maintained to achieve the realization of democracy.

Basic Platform

As for the party's basic platform, it is to implement democratic socialism. The goal of socialism is, of course, to eliminate the use of property as a tool for exploitation, but we advocate using a gradual approach, through parliamentary legislation, tax policies, etc., to achieve this goal, just like the British Labour Party. The party does not want to consider adopting violent policies to achieve socialism. Regarding politics, the party advocates implementing direct elections. Every political party must respect the opinions of voters and sincerely serve the people. Regarding local political systems, the party believes that China is a unitary state and should start with local autonomy, but the basic condition is that the central government should absolutely respect political and economic aspects. Regarding the current transitional period of domestic politics, the party fully supports the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and hopes to achieve peaceful unification as soon as possible. Regarding the reorganization of the government, the party believes that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party must first cease fire and seek unification through peace to eliminate all problems between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to achieve political democratization. Regarding the reorganization of the army, the party absolutely advocates the nationalization of the army. All national troops should be used for national defense and resisting foreign aggression. Political parties must not privately own troops. He also stated that if the current domestic situation continues to be fought for a long time, not only will the social system be chaotic, but the financial economy will also be unsustainable. In order to maintain its international status after victory, it is necessary to cease fire quickly. As for the suggestion that the Chinese issue be submitted to the United Nations Security Council for joint resolution, we believe that there is no need for this and therefore do not agree, because Special Envoy Marshall's mediation in China is based on the principles decided at the Moscow Three-Power Conference. When asked by the reporter whether the party would be prepared to participate if the government was reorganized, he said: Under the principle of resolving domestic disputes and benefiting the overall situation of peace, we are willing to consider it.

### Civil Servant Housing; Internal Planning Underway; To Be Implemented First in Nanjing Next Spring

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] It is reported that the internal construction department is planning the issue of housing for civil servants nationwide. For middle-level civil servants, the ministry will work with the Four Banks Joint Office to provide loans.

For lower-level civil servants, the government will allocate funds to build simple and practical houses with water and electricity facilities. Rental prices will be kept as reasonable as possible. It is planned to implement this first in the capital in the spring of the 36th year of the Republic. The budget is about 20 billion national currency, and it is expected to be completed nationwide within ten years.

### U.S. Military Trusteeship of Disputed Areas Denied; Minister Peng Strongly Denies Inaccurate United Press and Associated Press Reports

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] A Central News Agency reporter inquired with Minister Peng regarding the report in domestic and foreign newspapers in Shanghai, citing a United Press Nanjing dispatch on the 23rd, stating: "Chairman Chiang has agreed to a Chinese proposal to place all disputed areas in China completely under U.S. trusteeship," and similar news transmitted by the Associated Press on the same day. Minister Peng solemnly replied, "This statement is completely unfounded."

The provincial government has also formed a ground survey team, which will depart for work within the week.

### Tianjin Social Bureau Secretly Hoarded Grain; Investigation Team Lodges Protest; Demands Apology from Mayor Zhang and Punishment

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 24th] The investigation team for takeover work has been here for four days. The investigation work is being actively carried out by various committee members in their assigned units. A rather intriguing event occurred on the 22nd. On the day the team arrived in Tianjin, it received a secret report stating that the Social Bureau had secretly hoarded more than 2,000 jin of grain when organizing winter relief last year, attempting to sell it unsuccessfully. It had all rotted. After receiving the report, the team sent two committee members, Rong Zhao and Huang Yuren, to conduct an investigation. It was confirmed that it was true. The wheat was hidden in the cellar of the Municipal No. 51 Elementary School and had become moldy. After the incident, Hu Menghua, director of the Social Bureau, rushed to persuade various newspapers not to disclose the news to avoid trouble. The next day, all newspapers remained silent. Committee members Rong and Huang were extremely angry when they heard about this. They believed that the Social Bureau used its power to control news and publications to block news. Moreover, the fact that the winter relief wheat was hoarded until autumn clearly showed a suspicion of using official power to seek personal gain, which greatly affected the future work of the investigation team. They submitted a joint letter to Mayor Zhang of the municipal government, lodging a protest and demanding: (1) an apology to the team; (2) appropriate punishment for the director of the Social Bureau; (3) a guarantee that similar incidents will not occur again.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 24th] After the takeover work investigation team arrived in Pan, the work was extremely tense. They have been inspecting various factories and warehouses for days. Chief Qian Gonglai attached great importance to some of the moldy materials in the warehouse. According to Qian, the factories and warehouses store a large amount of materials. If they are not processed quickly, they will be damaged, which would be a major loss to the country. He has instructed the persons in charge of various factories and warehouses to sort and categorize them according to their nature and clean them up as soon as possible. Mr. Qian and others are scheduled to go to Fushun, Anshan, Yingkou and other places today for inspection.

There was no other mission. They will return to Nanjing tomorrow.

### Chairman Shen Inspects Dinghai and Holds a Symposium on Revitalizing Fisheries and Agriculture; Zhejiang Provincial Government Orders Counties to Simplify Administrative Systems

[Our Dinghai Dispatch, 24th] Zhejiang Chairman Shen Honglie left Ningbo and crossed the sea to Dinghai County on the 23rd. This county is one of the main islands of the Zhoushan Islands, one of China's three major fishing grounds. The entire county of 400,000 people depends on fisheries for a living. After Mr. Shen arrived, he inspected various streets. He then had lunch by invitation of Yang Daozhao, the commissioner stationed in Dinghai by the Naval Headquarters. Mr. Yang treated Mr. Shen very warmly because Chairman Shen was a veteran of the Navy. This was the first time Mr. Shen had accepted an outside appointment since he began his tour. In the afternoon, he inspected various agencies and organizations and held a public security meeting. In the evening, he held a symposium, focusing on issues such as the revitalization of fisheries and agriculture. The spring fishing season in Dinghai was poor, and fishermen had no money to repay their debts, suffering greatly. They only hope that the winter fishing season will be successful to avoid falling into a dangerous situation. After Mr. Shen gave separate instructions, he attended Dinghai's welcome meeting on the morning of the 24th, inspected Shenjiamen, a fishing concentration area, and went to Putuo for inspection.

### Minister Gu of the Ministry of Social Affairs Inspects the Zibo Mining Area; All Sectors in Shandong Plead for Relief for Refugees

[Our Jinan Dispatch, 24th] Various sectors in the city telegraphed the central government, earnestly requesting the speedy allocation of 2 billion yuan for emergency relief to help refugees. Minister of Social Affairs Gu Zhenggang also promised to forward the request to the central government for the allocation of huge funds for relief. Because Liaocheng was besieged for eight months, 20 million yuan was specially allocated, and the Shandong Youth Rehabilitation Branch was requested to allocate another 10 million yuan for joint relief. Refugees in the city requested a loan of 500 million from the central government to run small-scale industrial and commercial loans. 20 million yuan was allocated by the Ministry of Social Affairs as a foundation for schools for orphans. Minister Gu arrived in Zhangdian on the evening of the 23rd and inspected the Zibo mining area on the 24th.

[Our Jinan Dispatch, 22nd] Minister of Social Affairs Gu Zhenggang and others inspected the No. 1, 2, and 4 temporary middle schools in Jinan at noon on the 22nd, which accommodated homeless and out-of-school youths from various counties. Due to high prices in Jinan, each person's food expenses require 30,000 yuan per month, but each student currently only receives 7,000 yuan in relief funds per month, so they are all underfed. When inspecting the dormitory of the First Temporary Middle School, more than 300 male and female students were squatting under the shade of trees for lunch because there was no dining hall. Eight people formed a group with only twelve corn buns, more than ten pieces of pickled vegetables, and a tile basin of cold water. The Fourth Temporary Middle School was set up in the former Ma Barracks. The horse trough was changed into a washroom. The classrooms leaked rain, and the doors and windows were open. Soil was piled up as benches. More than ten people lived in one bedroom. Mr. Gu gave a speech to the students under broken tiles and crumbling walls, expressing his condolences. The students were moved to tears. More than 500 male and female students listening to the speech had no socks. The male students had broken shoes that exposed their toes, and their faces were thin and yellow. One student said: "I wash my white short jacket every night and wear it the next day. I have no other clothes. Winter is coming, and I don't know how to keep warm." According to the principals of the two temporary middle schools, there are nearly 10,000 displaced students in Jinan. Most of them are underfed. Because there is no funding, they drink cold water and many are sick. They are eagerly awaiting relief from the central government.

### Five Commissioners and County Magistrates in Hebei Province Removed from Office and Investigated for Corruption; Tianjin Requests Instructions on Flexible Measures for Civil Servant Issues

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 24th] Baoding Dispatch: Chairman Sun Tongzhong of Hebei Province is earnestly rectifying officialdom. He announced today that two commissioners and three county magistrates have been removed from office and investigated for dereliction of duty and corruption. The two commissioners are Liu Peichu, the administrative inspector of the First District of Qinhuangdao, and Zhang Runsheng, the commissioner of the Ninth District of Dingxian. The three county magistrates have been handed over to the Beiping District Court. They are Cai Wenshan, the county magistrate of Huai'an County, Liu Zilin of Tongxian, and Meng Qingyi of Wangdu.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 24th] The order requiring current civil servants who participated in puppet organizations for up to five years to be dismissed has been received by Beiping, Tianjin, and Hebei Province. The leaders of each unit find it difficult to implement. Zhang Ting'e, Mayor of Tianjin, said that he has requested instructions on flexible measures. Beiping and Hebei Province have indicated that they will jointly request instructions on measures if necessary.

### Anping Incident Team Yesterday Went to Da Xiao Sha River

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 24th] The 25th Special Team of the Military Mediation Department investigating the Anping Incident, after returning to Beiping from Xianghe yesterday, held another meeting on the morning of the 24th, deciding to go to Anping's Da Xiao Sha River to conduct an on-site investigation. They departed at 1:30 PM, expecting to return to Beiping the same day, but had not returned as of 9:00 PM. [Our Newspaper, Beiping, 23rd] The 25th Team returned to Beiping from Xianghe at 6:00 PM on the evening of the 23rd. They may go to the scene of the Anping incident again on the afternoon of the 24th to investigate. This round trip of the team, staying in Xianghe for three days, further proves that the National Army did not participate in the American army's ranks, nor did they pass through the Pingjin Highway to fight against the Communist army. During the interrogation on the 22nd, the Communist army provided four witnesses, namely Wang Zhichao, a commander from the 14th Military Sub-district of Eastern Hebei, Li Qingchun, the company commander of the 5th company of the 2nd battalion of the 50th regiment, Wang Entao, a squad leader of the Tongxian Brigade, and Ma Deming, a sentry of the 5th company of the 2nd battalion of the 53rd regiment. Wang Zhichao, the commander of the Communist army who participated in the conflict, strongly asserted that the American and National armies jointly attacked, and that two of his soldiers charged to the front of a jeep, and when seizing an enemy's rifle, the opponent pleaded in Chinese, "If you take my gun, I won't be able to live." This was used to prove that the National Army and the American army were fighting shoulder to shoulder. However, his description of the soldier who spoke Chinese was inconsistent, once saying he was in the car and once saying he was on the ground. The rifle they claimed to have seized as a Zhongzheng type rifle, after inspection by the team, turned out to be an old Mauser broken rifle. Therefore, the claim that the National Army participated in the battle has been disproved. Whether this matter was a Communist army conspiracy or not has not yet been fully determined. What is known is that two weeks before the incident in Anping, a platoon from the Tongyu Brigade of the Communist army was transferred there. As for the platoon of the 5th company of the 2nd battalion of the 53rd regiment that was later transferred, according to a report from a senior Communist officer, they were transferred to that location on the 24th. However, according to the sentry of that company, Ma Deming, they had not yet been stationed in the Anping area on the 28th. The Communist army's strength was temporarily reinforced. As for how the Communist army was mobilized, it is currently not very clear. However, the closest distance between the Communist army's outpost and the American army was thirty yards. Americans and Chinese differ in figure, skin color, and features, making it easy for the Communist army to identify them. As for whether the area is a "Liberated Zone," according to the combined testimonies of the Communist witnesses, the Communist army was not regularly stationed in that area before the Anping incident. The area seems to be a mixed area of the National and Communist armies. The team arrived in Xianghe at 3:00 PM on the 21st after passing through difficult muddy roads and crossing the Beiyun River, which marks the boundary between the two armies. Zeng Yongya, the commander and brigade commander of the 14th Military Sub-district of the Communist army, hosted a banquet that evening to express his appreciation and held a simple welcome party. The next day, they interrogated the four witnesses provided by the Communist army. That evening, a variety show was held to entertain the guests. That day, from afternoon to late at night, artillery fire intermittently came from the suburbs, and the window glass rattled. However, the team members continued to work. This morning, after interrogating three civilian witnesses provided by the Communist side, they will return to Beiping. The 27th team's subgroup responsible for mediating the conflict in the Xianghe area arrived in Xianghe in the afternoon when the 25th team left Xianghe.

### Guangzhou News Reporters

Do Not Attend Mayor's Reception

[United Press, Guangzhou, 23rd] Guangzhou City's news reporters have begun a boycott movement against Mayor Ouyang Ju. The mayor does not provide the press with any convenience. Except for holding regular meetings, receiving reporters, and issuing written statements, it is usually difficult to get close to him. This afternoon, the boycott movement began. The mayor had originally scheduled to receive reporters at noon, but no reporters attended at the appointed time. Hot tea and exquisite cakes were placed on the conference table, but no one appreciated them. A reporter said: "When we interview municipal officials, we are often met with closed doors. Now, even if there are delicious refreshments, we are not willing to accept them."

### Hangzhou City Reporters Demand the Impeachment of Speaker Luo Yun

Accuse Him of Speaking Up for Wang Wuquan

[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 24th] The Hangzhou City Council, because its Speaker Luo Yun spoke up for the traitor Wang Wuquan, held a reception for reporters today to express the council's attitude, stating that it has always upheld the principles of justice and frankness. Luo's words and actions were inappropriate and cannot represent the council's opinions. During the meeting, Hangzhou reporters added questions, demanding the impeachment of Luo Yun, and requested Zhu Qizhi, the defense lawyer for the traitor Wang, to donate the litigation fee of 3.2 million yuan to the poor people in his district to clear his suspicion. It was previously reported that the Hangzhou Provisional Council applied to restore dance halls. It is now known that the council did not formally apply before canceling them.

### Correspondences from Various Places, Rugao's Order Gradually Stabilizes, Lack of Food in the City

Commissioner Xu Talks About the Situation After Recovery

[Our Newspaper, Nantong Correspondence] Xu Mojia, the Administrative Inspector Commissioner of the Fourth District of Jiangsu Province, inspected Rugao again on the 15th of this month after its recovery and returned to Nantong on the 18th. According to him: the order in the Rugao area is gradually stabilizing, and the government agencies are working quite intensely. There is a lack of rice in the city, and civil servants eat flour. The market is showing signs of improvement, but the Tong-Ru highway is still being damaged by the Communist army from time to time. When Commissioner Xu arrived in Rugao, Chairman Wang Maogong also flew to Rugao to inspect, but because the airport was damaged by the Communist army, he could not land and returned to Zhenjiang.

Luoyang Town Chief Shot and Killed by Bandits, Shen Guangshu, the town chief of Luoyang Town in the Sixth District of Dongxiang, this county, was over fifty years old. He was honest, sincere, and courageous in undertaking tasks. On the 21st at dusk, at his residence in Shenjiatou, a little over a mile away from the town, while he was having supper, three bandits dressed in plain clothes who spoke with local accents suddenly broke in, falsely claiming: "We are from the Luoyang Security Team. Which one is Town Chief Shen?" Shen stood up and replied that he was, and invited them to sit down. At that moment, another bandit suddenly drew a pistol and shot Shen in the head, firing three shots in succession. Town Chief Shen immediately fell to the ground and died. The bandits also hesitated and fled. The county government, upon receiving the report, immediately ordered the district authorities to strictly apprehend the murderers.

Changshu Pleads for Relief to Industry and Commerce with the Ministry

The county chamber of commerce recently telegraphed the Ministry of Finance and the Executive Yuan, stating that industry and commerce here are suffering from the impact of foreign goods dumping and the pressure of rising costs. Also, because the establishment of silver and money houses is not widespread, funds are out of balance, and they are subject to high-interest loans, resulting in an imminent overall collapse. They requested that the Changshu branches of the Bank of Communications and the Central Bank be designated to allocate 10 billion yuan in industrial and commercial loans for relief.

Declare Martial Law Lifted and Restore Normalcy This city defense headquarters, in order to cope with special circumstances and ensure the security of the city, has imposed martial law since the 14th of this month. Under the joint preparation of various military agencies and teams, Anning has been the same as usual for days. County Magistrate Pan, in view of this, issued an order to declare the lifting of martial law and restore all temporary measures to normal.

Fengxian This Year's Land Tax to Be Converted to National Currency

The land tax of Jiangsu Province this year was originally set at four dou and nine sheng of grain per yuan of tax. Although the provincial government later submitted to the central government and was approved to reduce the original amount by 40%, calculating to one dou and nine sheng and six he of grain, this county has always relied on cotton as its main agricultural product, and rice and grain must rely on supply from neighboring counties. Therefore, the county authorities submitted to the provincial government for approval to convert the levy to ginned cotton. It is now learned that the county's provisional council, in order to reduce procedures, avoid malpractices, and reduce the burden on the people, has again requested the provincial government to convert it into the national currency. The province has been invited to approve it, and the county is currently telegraphing the province for instructions on the conversion method.

Haining The Boundary Between Ning and Tong Counties to Be Re-Surveyed

This county is connected to Tongxiang County, and disputes arise from time to time due to unclear demarcation. In 1928, the provincial government approved the permanent county boundary, but after the victory, it became unclear again, and misunderstandings arose from time to time. Land registration needs to be promoted urgently. Now, the land registration office of this county has written to the Tongxiang authorities to follow the past methods to carry out surveying work to facilitate the promotion of government orders.

Hangzhou The Completion of the Hang-Chun Highway is Extended

The highway between Hangzhou and Chun'an and the highway between Lanxi and Shouchang were previously approved by the Provincial Department of Communications for the Highway Administration of the Ministry of Communications to allocate funds for construction. It was originally scheduled to be completed by the end of this month, but due to insufficient time, it will be extended to September 15 to complete the traffic. The Yuhang-Lin'an section of the Hangmei Highway will also be completed at the same time.

Editorial

### The Contribution of the Chinese Delegation to the Peace Conference

The Paris Peace Conference has almost reached its "one-month" anniversary since its inception. However, in these twenty-odd days, we have only heard the grand pronouncements of the representatives of the twenty-one nations, as well as the opinions of the representatives of Italy, Finland, Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria on the peace treaty. The slow progress of the conference is almost unimaginable. In recent days, various committees have been meeting, but there has been no significant progress. The United Nations General Assembly is scheduled to be held in mid-September. If the peace treaties with Italy, Finland, Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria cannot be completed before the opening of the United Nations General Assembly, then these two equally important international conferences will be difficult to hold simultaneously in Paris and New York. Either the peace conference will be temporarily adjourned, or the United Nations General Assembly will be postponed. Therefore, at this time, it is necessary for the peace conference to expedite its work.

Although the Chinese delegation to the Paris Peace Conference has rarely spoken or wanted to make many proposals because these five peace treaties have no direct interest relationship with China, seeing the complexity and divergence of opinions among various countries, and the amendments to the draft treaties proposed by the representatives of various countries piling up like mountains, if they are all to be put forward for discussion, it will not only waste time, but also the representatives of various countries will debate until they are hoarse. Wang Shijie, the head of our delegation, together with the representatives of Belgium, Brazil, Canada, the Netherlands, and other countries, proposed an amendment to the preamble of the draft peace treaty with Italy, advocating that the preamble should praise the merits of the Italian democratic elements in resisting the fascist regime, which was well received by the representatives of all countries attending the peace conference. The Chinese delegation also issued a statement in Paris stating: "Although the Paris Peace Conference is not directly related to China's national interests, the Chinese delegation expresses great concern for the work of the peace conference. This delegation will strive to contribute to the fair resolution of all major issues. The negotiations of the Paris Peace Conference and the spirit it embraces will become a precedent for another conference, and the fate of Japan will be decided in that other conference."

The Peace Conference's Political and Territorial Committee met the day before yesterday and put forward the Chinese amendment for discussion. The original text of the amendment read: "After the Allied forces, with the assistance of the democratic elements of the Italian people, achieved victory, the Italian fascist regime was overthrown on July 25, 1943, and Italy surrendered unconditionally and signed armistice agreements on September 3 and 29 of the same year..." While the original text of the draft peace treaty with Italy read: "The Italian fascist regime was overthrown on July 25, 1943, under military pressure, and Italy immediately surrendered unconditionally and accepted the armistice agreements signed on September 3 and 29 of the same year..." The Chinese representative also stood up and spoke, explaining that the purpose of the Chinese delegation in proposing this amendment was to praise the merits of the Italian people in resisting the fascist regime. After he finished speaking, he immediately received the endorsement of the United States and France and was unanimously passed by the committee.

This Paris Peace Conference, whether it was the plenary session or the meetings of various committees, had never passed a Chinese amendment as smoothly as it did that day. As far as the Chinese delegation is concerned, this is indeed a great success for them in participating in the peace conference. Before Foreign Minister Wang set off for Paris, he issued a statement explaining China's attitude towards the peace conference: (1) The purpose of this trip is to promote the success of the peace conference; (2) China must support all proposals that can strengthen the foundation of world permanent peace. In other words, international justice is the main foundation of world permanent peace; (3) All territorial disputes should be resolved with nationalism as the highest principle; (4) The peace given by the United Nations to its enemy countries must avoid all unnecessary and dangerous conditions. Foreign Minister Wang also spoke about this when he made his first speech at the peace conference? He also publicly declared that Italy's contributions in the late stage of the war should be reasonably recognized. This time, the proposal of the amendment and its unanimous passage by the committee can also be said to be Wang's success, implementing his proposition.

Because of geographical obstacles, China did not directly participate in the battles in the European theater in this war, but China was a pioneer in the fight against aggression, first raising the banner of anti-fascism, and containing millions of Japanese troops, trapping them in the quagmire of China, making it impossible for them to participate in the European war and assist Germany in the war. Therefore, China can at least be said to have indirectly participated in the European countries. During the Potsdam Conference, the three giants also declared that the peace treaty should be drafted by the foreign ministers' conference organized by the five countries of Britain, the United States, France, the Soviet Union, and China. However, China has no direct interest relationship with the peace treaty, so it has never intervened in the drafting of the peace treaty. This time, our country's representatives proposed the amendment, not because they had a special fondness for Italy, nor because our country had other intentions, but purely out of the motivation to promote the success of the peace conference. Australian representative Beasley congratulated our country's representatives, saying: "It is fortunate that the content of the treaty will not be bound by the draft prepared by the four foreign ministers' conference." This sentence has profound meaning and is worth pondering by the representatives of all countries.

Looking forward to the future of the peace conference, because the interests of the representatives of various countries are inconsistent, there are many difficulties, and most of them are problems that are not easy to solve and need to be considered for a long time. Therefore, at present, it is difficult to expect the Paris Peace Conference to make rapid progress in the shortest possible time. Our country's delegation in Paris should still adhere to its original intention, continue to work hard, see clearly the cracks in the contradictions between countries, and make repairs to leaks at any time, propose amendments that conform to international justice, so as to contribute to the success of the peace conference. This will not only help to clarify European politics, but also have a great relationship with the future development of the Far East situation. If the Paris Peace Conference unfortunately fails, the impact will be such that the Far East Peace Conference will be far away, and the peace treaty with Japan will not be smoothly produced.

### Yugoslavia is Blustering, US Secretary of the Army Patterson Roars, Saying US Troops Should Deploy and Fight at Any Time, Ready to "Have a Go," US Secretary of the Army Patterson

[Our Newspaper Comprehensive News] The US ultimatum to Yugoslavia expired on the 24th. The Yugoslav government officially broadcast in Belgrade on the 23rd, stating that Marshal Tito had decided to refuse to reply to the US ultimatum, believing that the ultimatum was unnecessary because the US airmen forced down in Yugoslav territory had already been released on the 22nd. In fact, this attitude of Yugoslavia is nothing more than strong on the outside but weak on the inside. According to an analysis by Agence France-Presse, although Marshal Tito has expressed his refusal to reply to the ultimatum, in fact Yugoslavia has complied with its demands: First, all the pilots and passengers of the US aircraft forced down on the 9th of this month have been released and allowed to return to the border; Second, the US authorities have been granted permission to go to the scene of the incident to inspect the remains of the US aircraft shot down on the 19th of last month; Third, according to a telegram from Patterson, the US ambassador to Yugoslavia, the Yugoslav government has agreed to do its utmost to prevent similar incidents from happening again. In addition, it is also learned that Marshal Tito has ordered the pilots of fighter jets to avoid shooting down foreign aircraft flying over Yugoslav airspace. On the other hand, US Secretary of the Army Patterson, in a speech to the American Legion Convention in Boston on the 23rd, expressed extreme indignation at the shooting down of US aircraft by Yugoslavia. He said that Yugoslavia is our ally, and its current position is mostly due to our country's continuous supply, but this ally now deliberately shoots down our aircraft and unreasonably defends itself, which cannot but make every American feel indignant. He also said that the United States must have a well-trained army, ready to be ordered to go to war at any time.

### Whereabouts of the Second US Aircraft is the Crux of the Problem

What the United States demands in its final ultimatum includes two items: one is the release of all personnel on board the US aircraft forced down on the 9th of this month, and the other is to have US personnel make contact with the personnel who were not killed in the crash of the second US aircraft shot down, and release them immediately. The first matter has now been completely resolved, and what remains is only the second matter. Acting US Secretary of State Acheson stated at a press conference in Washington on the 23rd that the United States is not satisfied with this matter and must wait for the exact news of the whereabouts of the personnel of the second US aircraft before it can consider the final opinion. As to whether the United States will still submit this case to the United Nations Security Council, Acheson did not make a clear statement, only asking reporters to pay attention to the content of the US note, saying that the United States will determine its subsequent steps based on the evidence and Yugoslavia's actions to correct its errors. It can be seen that the crux of the current problem is only in the whereabouts of the second US aircraft that was shot down.

### Yugoslavia Launches Counterattack, Diplomatic War Intensifies

[Agence France-Presse, London, 24th] The Daily Mail quoted a Paris dispatch as saying: Yugoslavia has decided to submit one hundred and sixty cases of US violations of Yugoslav airspace to the United Nations, which is a countermeasure to the US action. According to Reuters: Yugoslavia will also file a complaint with the United Nations to protest the US detention of Yugoslav ships. This action has clearly made the most serious diplomatic conflict since the war even more complicated. Yugoslavia's accusation against the United States was submitted to UN Secretary-General Lie, requesting that the "unreasonable detention of Yugoslav ships in the Danube River by the US occupying forces" be included in the agenda. According to the Yugoslav representative attending the United Nations, Yugoslavia only asked the Economic and Social Council to discuss the Danube River navigation issue. As far as he knew, the Yugoslav letter to the United Nations did not mention the United States.

British Bomber Squadron Visiting the United States

If the Soviet Union fears that its Black Sea base will be attacked from the Mediterranean through the Straits, it only needs to rely on the United Nations. Turkey has deep faith in the United Nations.

Litvinov

[This newspaper's report] London, 24th Broadcast: It is reported that Litvinov has been dismissed from his position as Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister. The Soviet Council of Ministers unanimously approved the selection of Gusev, the Soviet Ambassador to England, and Malik, the former Soviet Ambassador to Japan, as Deputy Foreign Ministers.

It is noted that Litvinov previously served as Soviet Foreign Minister and Ambassador to the United States.

Litvinov was a supporter of collective security and advocated for close relations with Britain and the United States. He resigned as Foreign Minister before the outbreak of the European war, and was succeeded by Molotov. When German troops invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, Litvinov rejoined the Soviet diplomatic corps, arriving in the United States as Soviet Ambassador one day before Pearl Harbor. On August 22, 1943, Gromyko succeeded Litvinov as Soviet Ambassador to the United States, at a time when the Soviet Union was calling for the opening of a second front in the West. (United Press)

### Regarding the Preamble to the Italian Peace Treaty, Our Amendment Was Passed, Noting the Public Achievements of Italian Democrats

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 23rd] Regarding the amendment proposed by the Chinese delegation to the draft preamble of the Italian Peace Treaty, which advocated praising the merits of Italian democrats in resisting the fascist regime in the preamble, it was unanimously passed by the Committee on Italian Political and Territorial Affairs on the 22nd. The committee discussed the first paragraph of the preamble, which listed the names of the countries signing the Italian Peace Treaty, and it was unanimously passed by the meeting without discussion. The second paragraph was then discussed, and the Italian representative wanted to amend it, arguing that the responsibility for the war should be distinguished between the Fascist regime and the Italian people, which led to a lengthy debate. Finally, the Dutch representative proposed an amendment, arguing to replace "Italy declared war" with "Italy fought," which was put to a vote and passed by a majority of eleven votes to nine. The third paragraph was then discussed, and the representatives of various countries automatically abandoned their proposed amendments to facilitate the amendment proposed by the Chinese representative. The representatives of Belgium, Brazil, Canada, the Netherlands, and Yugoslavia unanimously expressed their support. The original text of the Chinese representative's amendment stated, "After the Allied forces were assisted by the democratic elements among the Italian people to achieve victory, the Italian fascist regime was overthrown on July 25, 1943, and Italy surrendered unconditionally, and signed an armistice agreement on September 3rd and 29th of the same year..." while the original text of the draft of the Italian Peace Treaty was "The Italian fascist regime was overthrown under military oppression on July 25, 1942, and Italy surrendered unconditionally, and accepted the armistice agreement signed on September 3rd and 29th of the same year..." The Chinese representative stood up and spoke, explaining that the purpose of this amendment was to praise the merits of the Italian people in resisting the fascist regime. The representatives of the United States and France unanimously expressed their support. The Australian representative, Beasley, then stood up and spoke, expressing his congratulations to the Chinese representative, and said that regarding the content of the peace treaty, the peace conference was no longer bound by the draft formulated by the Four Foreign Ministers Conference. The Soviet representative, Vyshinsky, was deeply surprised to hear this, and said that the Chinese amendment and the original text of the draft peace treaty did not differ significantly. The first paragraph was largely the same, and as for the second paragraph praising the merits of the Italian people in resisting the fascist regime, it has always been supported by the Soviet representatives. The British representative, McNeil, agreed with the Chinese amendment, which was unanimously passed by the committee. At this point, the committee announced the adjournment of the meeting, and will continue to meet next Monday.

### Japan Actively Prepares for Peace Terms Negotiations

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 22nd] According to well-informed sources, the Second Government is actively preparing for future peace terms negotiations, as the belief that the Allied powers do not intend to arrange a peace treaty with Japan is increasing.

### MacArthur Designates 500 Factories, For Japanese Reparations, Ambassador Koo Negotiates with the US on Japanese Reparations Issues

[Kaizo Sha, Tokyo, 24th] According to a special announcement from the Foreign Affairs Bureau of MacArthur Headquarters, MacArthur Headquarters today ordered the custody of 505 factories in eight sectors of Japanese industry, which is the second measure in the plan for reparations between Japan and China. The industrial sectors designated this time are machine tools, steel mills, thermal power generation, bearings, soda ash, chlorine and caustic soda, shipbuilding, sulfuric acid, and civilian ordnance factories. The designation this time is based on the reparations targets approved by the Far Eastern Commission and the standards for selecting factories. As for aircraft factories and research institutes, they were already designated as the first measure in the interim reparations plan. Lee Dee, the head of the Industry Department of the Economic and Scientific Bureau of MacArthur Headquarters, said in a statement on the matter that no country on the United Nations side has actually designated the dismantling of a certain factory at this time, and this matter must be decided in the future. The commander of the Eighth Army was instructed to effectively manage the designated factories, and to allow the factories deemed necessary for the purposes of occupation to continue to operate until a final decision has been made on the dismantling of the specified factories.

[Kaizo Sha, Tokyo, 24th] After MacArthur Headquarters designated Japanese factories to be used as reparations for the second time today, the overall scale of the factory equipment to be dismantled has been fully clarified. It is reported that MacArthur Headquarters first ordered the custody of a total of 394 aircraft factories, army and navy factories, and research institutes on January 20 for use as reparations. After slight additions and deletions on May 30, the number became 594. Adding the 505 factories announced today, the total is 1,099 factories. The wartime military factories existing in Japan have been virtually completely included, and their number accounts for one-third of all Japanese factories. These factories will be used to restore the industries of various countries that were destroyed by the Japanese army.

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] The focus of negotiations on the issue of Japanese reparations is not in Tokyo but in Washington, where Ambassador Koo is currently in charge, negotiating with the US State Department. The Allied powers have requested our side to submit a list of losses incurred due to Japanese aggression in order to accurately determine the amount of compensation. It is now known that a portion of this information has been sent, but it will take some time to complete the list. It is heard that the US side has expressed sympathy for our country's request for priority compensation rights. Regarding how to compensate for the losses caused by the Soviet army's removal of industries in the Northeast, the nature of the matter is not simple, and it cannot be discussed at present. Qualified persons believe that the issue of reparations from Japan in the Far East must be resolved at the Far Eastern Peace Conference to be held next year.

### US Submarine Force Conducts Exercises in the Arctic Sea

### MacArthur Allows Japanese to Whaling in the Southern Ocean, Britain and Norway Protest to the United States

According to the State Department today, Britain and Norway have lodged verbal protests against MacArthur's suggestion.

### The Palestine Issue is Becoming More Complicated and Delicate, Britain's Predicament is Difficult to Advance or Retreat

[Reuters, London, 23rd] Relevant sources here sternly stated that the turmoil in Palestine will delay the demobilization of the military and cost Britain money and lives. This price is extremely unreasonable if it is not used to acquire peace, security, and goodwill. Moreover, the instability of the Palestinian situation is enough to cause Britain to be criticized from all sides. Britain is currently suffering from pressure from the Jewish, Arab, and American sides, so some people feel that it is better for others to come and resolve the Palestinian issue, but this is only a word of anger at the moment.

From a Military Strategic Perspective, Britain Sees it as a Lifeline

For the sake of imperial communication and world security, Britain cannot immediately abandon Palestine. The recent suspension of British-Egyptian negotiations is sufficient to indicate the importance of the Empire's military strategic plans. The decision to withdraw from Egypt has political motivations. British military strategic planners do not show opposition because southern Palestine can serve as a new base in the Middle East. We no longer need to point out how important the imperial lifeline of the Red Sea-Suez Canal-Mediterranean Sea is to Britain, whether in wartime or peacetime. After Britain abandons Egypt, its strongholds in the Eastern Mediterranean are only Greece, Cyprus, and Palestine. The political situation in Greece is unstable, and Cyprus feels too small, so Palestine is an ideal defense center.

Ensuring Friendship with Arab Countries, Key to Middle East Security

On the surface, the Jewish people do not seem to reject Britain's security plan. If Britain can allow the demands of the Jewish people, then the Jewish people are often willing to provide Britain with base facilities, etc., and the Arab people may also be willing to make the same concessions. However, taking Egypt as a lesson from the past, it is feared that at the same time, the Arab people will still inevitably propose the demand for the British to withdraw. British and American public opinion has now forced the British government to pay attention to the voices of the Jewish people, but the Arab people have expressed extreme indignation at the British government's failure to find a way to prevent Jewish immigration, and since Britain's Middle East policy is based in part on the Arab League, it cannot turn a blind eye to this situation. The security of the Middle East depends on whether it can maintain friendship with the Arab world. The Arab League has repeatedly stated that it is determined to support the Arab people of Palestine. Some officials here are also afraid that if Britain ignores their voices, the Arab world may lean towards Moscow. In addition to military issues, Palestine also involves issues such as sea and air traffic and the supply of important materials such as oil.

Seeking Plan Implementation Requires US Assistance

From the perspective of the United States, Britain does not dare to ignore the opinions of the United States, because the Palestine plan must ultimately be approved by the United Nations organization, and it is impossible to pass without the help of the United States. On the one hand, there are six Arab countries in the United Nations, and if Jordan participates again, the number will increase to seven, and they have considerable power in the General Assembly, so the current situation of Britain has fallen into a dilemma.

### Danube River Navigation, United States Clarifies Policy

[US News Bureau, Washington, 23rd] Acting Secretary of State Acheson told reporters when answering questions about the current status of ships on the Danube River that the countries bordering the Danube River are now unwilling to allow their controlled ships to sail out of certain sections of the river. He pointed out that the United States has announced that the United States is willing to discuss the issue of opening up navigation on the Danube River with the countries concerned, so that the countries bordering the river can restore their normal economic life. The Soviet government has detained several ships to Austria and Hungary, the reason for which is that these ships are suspected of being owned by Germany. In the occupied area of ​​Austria, some ships are probably the property of individuals or belong to the governments of countries other than Austria. Acheson said that the ship problem is only part of the overall navigation problem on the Danube River. The United States has repeatedly tried to discuss this matter. He has received reports that the United Nations Secretariat has received a letter from the government of Yugoslavia requesting a discussion of the ship problem in the Economic and Social Council, but he has not seen the letter.

### Japanese House of Representatives Passes New Constitution

### Establishment of the Greater Shanghai Urban Planning Committee, The planning period is based on the needs of 50 years as a preparation, and seven groups of committees such as land, transportation, and zoning are estimated.

[This newspaper's report] The Shanghai Municipal Urban Planning Committee held its inaugural meeting in the Municipal Government Conference Room yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, and convened its first meeting. Attendees included兼Chairman Wu Guozhen, ex officio committee members Zhao Kang, Zhu Ping, Zhao Zengjue, Zhang Wei, Gu Chunfan, Wu Kaixian (Li Jianhua acting), Gu Yuxiu (Li Ximou acting), appointed committee members Xi Yushu, Huang Boqiao, Li Qinglin, Shi Konghuai, Xue Cixin, Lu Yishou, Fan Wenzhao, Mei Yilin, Lu Shusen, Xu Guomao, Qian Naixin, Wang Zhixin and other more than 30 people, and Senate Speaker Pan Gongzhan attended.

### Chairman's Speech Expressing Hope that Superficial and Practical Work Proceed Simultaneously

First, Chairman Wu Guo briefly stated: The Urban Planning Committee was originally stipulated by the Ministry of Interior, and each province and city should establish one. Therefore, I am extremely pleased that the Shanghai Urban Planning Committee is announced today. In the past, Shanghai has never had a complete, large-scale urban plan. What existed was only for the central urban area. Although the former British and French Concessions cannot deny that they achieved considerable results, all facilities were unplanned. In order to establish standards for future urban construction and the guidelines for current administration, a general outline must be established, such as dividing the entire city into commercial areas, residential areas, dock areas, etc., which should be planned in advance and then gradually realized. Therefore, the Urban Planning Committee must simultaneously advance superficial work and practical work. Today, all those present are experts, and I believe that they will make great contributions to the future urban plan of Greater Shanghai. I would like to express my greatest welcome. Subsequently, Zhao Zukang read a telegram sent to the conference by Ha Xiongwen, Director of the Construction Department of the Ministry of Interior, on behalf of Minister Zhang of the Ministry of Interior, which mainly wished the Urban Planning Committee success.

Speaker Pan's Speech

Then, Speaker of the Council Pan Gongzhan delivered a speech: Briefly stating that the session of the Municipal Council is approaching, and opinions on municipal construction are being actively collected. Therefore, the establishment of the Shanghai Urban Planning Committee is extremely gratifying. Regarding all urban construction, it is unreasonable to only consider the present without looking to the future. Broadly speaking, the construction of the country is also the same. When the Founding Father drafted the Outline of National Reconstruction, it could be said that it was too focused on ideals given the environment at the time. However, now it seems to be the most valuable concrete plan to study. The Shanghai Urban Plan is not just a three-year or five-year plan, but should be a thirty-year or fifty-year plan. Before the war, Shanghai was divided into several spheres of influence, but today it is unified. Therefore, I deeply hope that the Shanghai Urban Planning Committee can formulate a good plan and then gradually promote its realization in stages. The popular will mechanism hopes that today's meeting is the beginning of urban planning, and wishes it success.

Discussion of Important Proposals

After Speaker Pan finished his speech, the executive secretary of the committee, Zhao Zukang, reported on the preparations. Then, various important proposals were discussed, the content and results of which are as follows: (1) It is proposed to appoint members to each group to facilitate progress.

### The Investigation of the Korean's Military Supplies to the Enemy Case is in its Final Stage; Sun Tianchang Has No Escape from Guilt; No Corruption Found in the Fourth Hospital

[Our Reporter] The case of Sun Tianchang planting military supplies to the enemy. Has been actively investigated by the Liquidation Group for several days. Sun himself has also been interrogated five times by Zhang Qingzhen, a member of the committee. Secret informants and Sun have both provided evidence. Therefore, the development of the case has reached its final stage. Yesterday afternoon, three members of the Liquidation Group, Zhang Qingji, Fan Zhengbo, and Wu Wangji, re-examined Sun Tianchang's warehouse on Seymour Road and the Mou Deli Piano Factory that Sun had seized during the enemy-puppet period. According to Member Zhang, the establishment of the case is beyond doubt. Although Sun tried to quibble about his dealings with the enemy chiefs and building military supplies and aircraft for the enemy, he could not escape in front of Member Zhang, who has a research background in criminal law. Therefore, during the five interrogations, Sun could not deny it. According to Member Wu Wangji, Sun's counter-evidence is numerous and precise. He is indeed a scientist. Even the invoices for purchases twenty years ago are still preserved. The Liquidation Group is now ordering him to submit invoices and business books for the purchase of various machines for investigation. As for the Municipal Fourth Hospital, the Liquidation Group's clerk Zhang Quan, together with Cao Xun, a technician from the Health Bureau, and Peng Yunkun, the chief of the section, jointly investigated the situation yesterday and did not find any corruption. Therefore, the reported case is considered to be untenable. It is also learned that the Liquidation Group is still accepting secret reported cases. The group plans to work in Hangzhou, Shaoxing, Ningbo, Wuxing, and other places. However, the 50-day time limit is too short. According to Zhang Qingzhi, a member of the group, it is inevitable that the period will be extended.

### Trial of American Air Force Murder Case Nears End

(Our Report) The case of Major Hawke, a pilot of the former Fourteenth Air Force, who was killed by the Japanese army in an accident in Hong Kong, has neared the end of the trial after several days of continuous trial by the U.S. military court.

However, the Shipping Guild has telegraphed the Jianghai Customs authorities requesting that the vessel be stopped from heading north. Therefore, whether customs clearance will be approved is attracting much attention.

### Wan Molin's Family Requests Bail; The Garrison Headquarters is Considering It

(Our Report) Yesterday, a person in charge of the Garrison Headquarters told reporters: It is rumored that Wan Molin once fainted in prison, which is true. Because Wan was engaged in underground work during the enemy-puppet period, he was tortured and watered by the Japanese, and his intestines were severely injured. Now the wound is festering again.

### The Gardener's Case of Shooting a Worker Transferred to the District Court; Trial Opened Yesterday

(Our Report) In March of this year, when a labor dispute occurred in the Shui Mu Company, the workers of the company had a clash with the security guards due to a misunderstanding. Two workers, Zhang Chunsheng and Zhu Jinfu, were shot and killed on the spot. Later, the police station arrested the culprits Ding Wensheng, Wan Guozhang, and He Senkun and sent them to the Garrison Headquarters. After a trial by the military court, Ding Wensheng was sentenced to one year in prison, and Wan Guozhang and He Senkun were acquitted. The judgment was immediately submitted to the Military Affairs Commission for review. The Commission considered that the members of the security guards were not active soldiers and should be tried by ordinary judicial organs, and the original judgment was invalid. The Garrison Headquarters then transferred the three to the local court. After investigation, the court filed a public prosecution against them on suspicion of murder. The case was opened in the district court yesterday morning. All three defendants claimed that they acted in self-defense and did not intentionally commit murder. The court ordered a rescheduling of the trial.

(Our Report) Zhang Zhiliang, a plainclothes police officer of the Puppet Shanghai Huangpu Police Branch, was sentenced to five years of imprisonment yesterday by the High Court on suspicion of being a traitor. On the same day, the High Court concluded several treason cases: (1) Fei Gongxia, the puppet Zhejiang Provincial Finance Director and the puppet Ministry of Finance Taxation Department Director, is 50 years old and from Jiaxing, Zhejiang. At the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, he served as the Songjiang County Chief and the Jiangsu Provincial Wartime Special Business Tax Director. In the 30th year of the Republic, Fei felt threatened when Ma Yuanfang and others from northern Jiangsu were arrested by the enemy puppets.

### Shen Fenggang's Crimes are Evident; He Completely Denies His Previous Confessions During the Trial

(Our News) Shen Fenggang, a former senior cadre of the puppet government's special services, 35 years old, from Funing, was tried in the High Court yesterday afternoon. The High Procuratorate's indictment stated: In the 28th year of the Republic, the defendant was led by Li Chuchen to carry out secret work in Shanghai. Later, the defendant was arrested by the enemy and immediately defected to the puppet government. On August 9 of the same year, Li Chuchen invited the defendant to Room 302 of the Cathay Hotel to secretly discuss the assassination of Li Shiqun. The defendant was responsible for the insider, but Shen reported this information to Li, and Li arrested Li Chuchen and others, resulting in their death. In addition, he successively killed Su Shaotao, an action member of the Central Party Headquarters in Shanghai, and Yu Yanzhi of the Military Command Bureau, and others, and was promoted to the director of the Third Division of the Puppet Special Services Headquarters and the captain of the First Special Detachment. When Li Shiqun launched the Jiangsu Qingxiang affairs, the defendant served as the Qingxiang Inspection Director. In March of the 31st year, he secretly reported Jiang Yaowen, Chen Hongxun, Chen Rongchang, Yao Guisheng, Xue Heshang, Yang Ming, Zhang Wenyuan, Qian Dadi, and Jiang Yaozhong, who participated in the work of the Shanghai West Administrative Promotion Committee, to the enemy's Hunan Party Soldier Team in Shanghai. After being tortured, they bribed the defendant with huge sums of money to be released. In October of the same year, Xiong Guisong, the captain of the Zhongjiu Army, was also arrested by the enemy's Bédan Road Gendarmerie and bribed the defendant with 230,000 yuan in puppet currency to be released. Zhang Xiongliang, the Shanghai head of the Youth League's Shanghai branch, was also shot and killed by him. Last night, Shen was wearing a light gray palace-style long shirt, white pants, and black shoes, carrying a black folding fan, standing in the defendant's column, eloquently defending himself, denying all the crimes of harming underground workers and others that the indictment accused him of. As for his own confession to the Military Command Bureau, he completely overturned it in court yesterday, claiming that it was a forced confession and could not be admitted. Finally, the defendant's defense lawyer also presented many documents proving his position in the central military organs. The court ordered a rescheduling of the trial.

### The Prosecution of Jiang Weicheng After Interrogating Bai Xiaolan

In addition, Jiang Weicheng (also known as Jiang Zhen) was prosecuted by the High Procuratorate on suspicion of being a traitor.

### The Active Nightingales of Night Shanghai Can Be Seen as an Example of Lamenting Geese

(Our Report) Every night, under the red and green neon lights, how many girls who have suffered all kinds of abuses are wandering in front of Shanghai's towering buildings, trying to exchange their already decadent souls for a little meager living expenses! They are subjected to contempt, they force smiles, but each of them is performing the tragedy that is being staged every day in this great Shanghai.

Yesterday, in front of the Shui An Company, two women, Chen Hanzhu and Li Miaoying, were arrested for indecency.

"Let's look at them as an example of lamenting geese." What are the records in the police station? A most strange fact: there are 763 brothels, but only 646 prostitutes!

In order to rectify public morals, the authorities shut down 29 massage parlors and 108 escort agencies. The "female employees" in the massage parlors, 433 people, and the "members" in the escort agencies, 2,500 people, have since disappeared!

As of the 23rd of this month, 2,354 dance girls have been registered.

But how many more are the "nightingales" who are active in Shanghai's sex market than these? Therefore, the likes of Chen Hanzhu and Li Miaoying are constantly dodging and flashing in the neon lights, and scene after scene of tragedy has to unfold every day.

### American Overseas Chinese Swindle and Impersonate Investigators

U.S. Military Hopes for Reports from All Sectors

Yesterday, the U.S. Military Headquarters announced: According to the U.S. Military War Criminals Investigation Office, it has been reported that American overseas Chinese have recently been impersonating personnel of the office to swindle and deceive. Therefore, if you encounter similar personnel in the future, you must ask them for evidence, otherwise they will be treated as impersonation, and it is hoped that they will be reported to the office for punishment. The office's telephone number is "50896."

### Coveting the Wealth of Neighbors, Sending a Letter of Blackmail Fails

(Our Report) Du Changsen, the owner of the Xinzhongguo Machine Wood Core Company at 22 Weinan Road, Yangshupu Road, suddenly received a threatening letter on the 19th. The original letter roughly stated: "I am temporarily borrowing 2 million yuan from Mr. Du. Send it to the entrance of the North Railway Station Post Office from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. on the 1st of this month. I will send someone to pick it up with a red letter as proof. Don't say anything. If you don't pay, I guarantee that if a child in your family at No. 22 or No. 24 is missing, it will only cost 10 million yuan. Let your family send someone around 20 years old to send the money. It's up to you whether you send it or not," and so on. Du reported this to the Yangshupu Branch, which sent police to wait at the agreed place on that day, but no one arrived. The next day, he received another express letter, changing the appointment to 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. on the 24th, calling the original person to send it to the North Railway Station Post Office, and said that a fiery red paper receipt would be used as proof. At 7 a.m. yesterday morning, the director of the Changyou Police Branch, Wang Xinheng, personally led the criminal section chief Xu Shibin, section member Zhang Yunsheng, inspector Wang Daoxuan, police chief Yin Shucheng, plainclothes police Li Zunzhi, Xie Ruquan, Zhang Shixing, and others, disguised as rickshaw pullers and hawkers, etc., and ambushed at the place. On one side, Du Changsen ordered his cousin Shi Shaoxi to hold a large paper package, pretending to be a large amount of legal currency, and stood at the designated destination. At about 8:10, a person came and waved to Shi, asking if the Du family from Weinan Road, Yangshupu Road, had sent him. He answered yes, and handed him the paper package. Before he had taken a few steps, he was arrested by the police. After being taken to the bureau for interrogation, he confessed that his name was Chu Zude, 17 years old. He had studied at Changshu Middle School in his hometown and came to Shanghai last year. After being unemployed in June, he temporarily resided at his friend Wu Fufa's place (24 Weinan Road). He saw that the Du family at No. 22 was rich and took this course of action because he was poor. It was all done by one person. The branch decided to send him to the local court tomorrow for investigation according to law.

### The Police Bureau's Statement on Foreign Residents' Residence Permits

(Our Report) In order to answer the comments published in the North China Daily News on August 18 regarding the issuance of foreign residents' residence permits in this city, the Police Bureau issued a public notice yesterday, stating that the purpose of issuing foreign residents' residence permits in this city is to closely protect foreign nationals of various countries residing in this city. The municipal government has long formulated measures and announced their implementation. However, due to the fact that a small number of foreign nationals have not fully understood the procedures, there have been delays, but the general situation is still good. As for the points mentioned in the comments of the North China Daily News, many are not in accordance with the facts, and the language is sarcastic. The author has distorted them. In addition to answering them one by one, the Police Bureau also stated that if foreign nationals in this city have any doubts or opinions regarding our government's laws and regulations, they should directly inquire or make suggestions to the competent authorities, and the government will sincerely answer and adopt them. If they maliciously criticize and confuse the public, they should bear legal responsibility. It is hoped that all foreign nationals can sincerely cooperate with our government.

### Pickpockets Caught and Lost Items Recovered on Election Night for Miss Shanghai; Hong Kong Gang Leader Called to Instigate

(Our Report) The election night for "Miss Shanghai" at the New Fairy Forest Ballroom was not only a sensation in Shanghai, but also far-reaching in Hong Kong and Guangdong. The city's pickpocket kings Shen Jinbao (nicknamed Xia Ke Xiao Shan) and Guang Yu (nicknamed Li Tou Guang Yu) received a call from the leader of another tightly organized gang in Hong Kong to instruct them to be active. So they dressed in suits and shoes, looking like young masters, bought tickets to enter the venue, and took the opportunity to "show off their skills." However, they were discovered by the undercover police officers densely deployed inside the venue and were arrested on the spot. Shares of stock of Qin Yu Stockings and Shirt Factory 25460-25461, Xinhe Yarn Factory 53462, and China Underwear Company 001646-001483, as well as a gold watch and a stainless steel watch, were seized. Witnesses were detained in the Shanghai Police Headquarters. It is hoped that the owners of the above items will go to the Detective Class of the Headquarters to claim them.

### Overwhelmed with Emotion Recalling a Visit to the Yat Sen Warship

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The Yat Sen warship has returned. On the 20th, the Japanese, acting on orders from General MacArthur's headquarters, sent it back to its homeland from the Wu Military Port. It is now berthed on the river surface at the Jiangnan Shipyard.

The "Yat Sen" was a light cruiser of the First Fleet of our Navy, a product of the Jiangnan Shipyard itself in the 16th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1927]. After the outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai Battle, it was assigned to the Jiangyin Fortress. Later, the Yat Sen was eventually sunk in the Yangtze River near Jiangyin.

After the National Army shifted its positions westward, the Japanese army salvaged the Yat Sen from the bottom of the Yangtze River and took it to Japan. Yesterday, when this reporter visited in a five-foot-long sampan and saw the Yat Sen again on the river, I couldn't help but feel a mix of memories and emotions.

Looking at it from the river, the Yat Sen has changed beyond recognition. The newly applied light iron-gray paint cannot hide the scars all over the ship's sides. In particular, a cabin has been added to the stern, sticking out like an unsightly wart.

As the sampan pulled alongside the ship, Deputy Captain An Guoxiang welcomed us into the reception room, and then accompanied us on a tour. Thus, I gained an initial impression of the interior of the ship: compact. Small, yes, everywhere feels cramped. However, you feel it is extremely compact, simple, and unadorned. The entire ship is 271 feet long, 34 feet wide, with a draft of 12 feet, and weighs 1500 tons. Of course, it cannot compare to the tall and large American ships, but it is a warship built by our country, the beginning of the new navy, and also an old soldier who has endured hardships. Although small, it is our honor, our pride.

Deputy Captain Mi is an enthusiastic and hardworking young man from Hunan. According to what he told this reporter during the tour, there was originally a six-inch caliber gun at the bow and a five-and-a-half-inch one at the stern. When the American army occupied Japan, they disarmed the ships and sank them all into the Pacific Ocean. After the Japanese navy took the "Yat Sen," they converted it into a training ship and added a cabin to the stern for use as a classroom, which is the wart we saw earlier.

We climbed up layer by layer from the so-called "uppermost deck" at the front of the ship to the top layer. There are a total of four layers. In order, they are: (1) the communications room and navigation rest area, (2) the control room (i.e., the usual bridge), (3) the open-air top layer, where a rangefinder is placed. The bridge is semi-enclosed, and the equipment is extremely simple. The compass is just an ordinary type with magnetic deviation, not a gyrocompass. From top to bottom, the various instruments are equipped with one characteristic: they are all Japanese-made, and the confidential mechanical devices have all been removed before being returned.

We met Captain Ren Guanghai, who had just finished his duties, on the top layer. Captain Ren is from Fujian. He has been in the navy since the Wuchang Uprising of 1911 and is a veteran. After a brief greeting, we took a photo. According to Captain Ren, the whole ship originally needed 160 sailors and 23 officers to cope adequately. Now, due to a lack of personnel, there are only about a hundred people in total, so everyone is a little busier, and the work is quite intense.

The Yat Sen warship seems to be a prototype of China's new navy. It is small and cramped, which is undeniable. However, as long as we can maintain this spirit of tension and hard work, I think perhaps these shallow-draft, small-tonnage warships will be the dawn of the defenders of China's 5,000-mile coastline. (The front picture is the full view of the Yat Sen, taken by this newspaper.)

### Graduation Ceremony of the Fourth Term of Police Cadets: Mayor's Admonition Expects Two Points - Pay Attention to Improving Traffic and Be Responsible for Banning Street Vendors

[Report from This Newspaper] The graduation ceremony of the fourth term of police cadets from the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau's Police Training School was held at the Pingliang Road parade ground at 8:00 a.m. yesterday. Mayor Wu and Police Chief Xuan personally attended to deliver admonitions. The graduation ceremony began at approximately 8:00 a.m. When Mayor Wu led the senior officers of the Police Bureau onto the main parade ground, the head of the Police Cadet Corps, Pan Jing, stepped forward to report the number of graduates: 300 male students and 60 female students, as well as 96 teachers and staff members of the Training School. Subsequently, Mayor Wu inspected the police cadets for a week and then ascended the rostrum. At this time, the band played in unison, and the police cadets marched in formation around the parade ground before forming a dense formation in front of the rostrum to await instructions. The chairman of the graduation ceremony was Deputy Director Yu Shuping. After the formalities were completed and the report was given, the mayor was invited to deliver his admonition.

Mayor Wu's admonition was full of encouragement, briefly stating: The police bear the greatest responsibility for the city, and 80% of the affairs are related to the police. At the same time, the police represent the credibility of the government. Therefore, whether they respect themselves affects the people's belief in the government. Mayor Wu also raised the most urgent problems in Shanghai to the graduating police cadets: (1) Traffic problems. The mayor himself is often delayed due to traffic congestion in the central district. He hopes that the graduating police cadets can pay attention to this point and study ways to improve it. (2) Banning street vendors. The mayor said: "At first, I thought most of them were refugees, so I couldn't bear to ban this kind of small business. After three months of research, I realized that this is not entirely the case. These street vendors sell foreign goods, canned goods, etc., especially stolen goods from the docks. Allowing them to exist is tantamount to encouraging theft." The mayor also pointed out that after September 1st, except for cigarette and snack vendors, all vendors will be strictly banned, and violators will have their goods confiscated. This kind of enforcement responsibility rests on the shoulders of each police cadet.

Next, Director Xuan delivered a speech, briefly stating: Experience should be given equal weight with knowledge. Today's graduation marks the end of the classroom courses, but it does not mean that police knowledge no longer needs to be learned in the future. Director Xuan loudly appealed and pointed out vigilantly that Shanghai's environment is dirty and filthy, and it is not easy for the bad to become good, but it is easy for the good to become bad. He said, "Here, front, back, left, and right, there is nothing but temptation of pleasure and profit. If the will is not firm, it is easy to be eaten by society. Therefore, we must strengthen our will and transform society, so that Shanghai can shine brightly and become a brand-new city for the revival of China." Then, the representative of the graduating police cadets stepped forward to the rostrum to give a response, expressing sincere acceptance of Mayor Wu's and the senior officers' admonitions and promising to take this as their goal and put it into practice. Finally, the chairman awarded prizes to 18 outstanding students from six classes, including criminal, traffic, etc. The graduation ceremony was thus completed. (Photos of the graduation ceremony are on page 8.)

### Police Bureau Conducts General Survey of Pet Dogs, Including Training Skills, Reasons for Raising Them, Etc.

[Report from This Newspaper] The Municipal Police Bureau, upholding its spirit of thoroughness, has recently decided to grant pet dogs the special privilege of household registration investigation. All dog lovers must first report their names, genders, ages, native places, occupations, etc., to the authorities in detail. Then, they must indicate the dog's breed, age, the dog owner's reason for raising the dog, whether the dog has been trained, the length of the training period, and the dog's skills, item by item on the form. The most interesting point is that each form has a blank space of one and a half inches long and half an inch wide, specifically for the dog owner to describe the general abilities of their beloved dog. If the dog is as skillfully clever as "Ling Ding Ding," then the owner will not know where to start writing.

As for the "Reason for Raising a Dog" item, it is also of great interest to the people of this city. What is the purpose of raising a dog? An old saying says, "A dog is man's best friend." I wonder what the police bureau will think of this kind of filling method? It is said that the form must be filled out in duplicate, and the fee for obtaining the dog's copper tag is also required to be 1,600 legal tender. The deadline for filling out the form is only seven days. If the dog owner does not pay attention or is stingy with this 1,600 yuan within seven days, then the dog will be excluded from legal society and subject to severe punishment by the police bureau.

### "One World" Award Winner, American Writer, Travels the World - Norman Cousins Visits China and Hosted Press Yesterday

[Report from This Newspaper] Mr. Norman Cousins, a well-known American journalist and publisher who won the first "Wendell Willkie One World Flight" award, recently came to China. Yesterday morning at 10:00 a.m., a press conference was held in the City Hall Auditorium. Cousins is tall and slender, wears glasses, and speaks clearly and powerfully. He contributed greatly to cultural work during the war, especially in broadcasting. Most of the late President Roosevelt's broadcast programs were hosted by him, and his works are often featured on more than 700 radio stations across the United States. Accompanied by Mr. Wei Jingmeng of the International Propaganda Office, he attended the conference and briefly introduced himself before standing up to deliver a speech. He briefly stated that the American people are people with ideals, which is not only evident in the Constitution and Declaration of Human Rights that form the foundation of the country, but also in the Civil War, which was fought for an ideal. The book "One World" by Wendell Willkie is a clear proof of the ideal viewpoints of the American people. Willkie traveled to various countries in 1942, when the international situation was at its worst, and wrote "One World" to report his encounters and experiences to the people. The part about China is particularly moving.

Although Willkie died with regret, his friends decided to continue his legacy and strive to realize his ideals. I personally have traveled to more than 20 countries and recently came to China. I have seen good and bad situations. My conclusion is that the unprecedented central problem in human history is how to achieve unity within countries and between countries, because coordination is very difficult, while division is extremely easy. We must seek a "technique" to achieve the ideal of "One World," and this "technique" must break away from the old ways. I once looked up the meaning of the word "diplomacy" in Webster's dictionary, and its explanation was "to obtain benefits with skill without incurring malice and war." This explanation is definitely no longer applicable today. We should give a new definition of "diplomacy" as "to build a country's reputation with skill." The "technique" we need is like the air conditioning in this room, which reduces the heatwave of international suspicion and disputes. This technique must be found quickly, otherwise it will lead to the misfortune of the world. After Cousins finished speaking, reporters asked questions. He believes that the exchange of international culture and art is very helpful in promoting international cooperation. He expressed deep regret for the recent trend of Chinese music becoming Westernized and hoped that Western music could also be Orientalized. Regarding the existence of American isolationists, he said that this war must have given them a very good lesson. It is reported that Cousins has obtained recordings of opinions on "One World" from British Prime Minister, Polish Prime Minister, Swedish Prince, Egyptian Emperor, Indian Nehru, as well as writers, reporters, and miners from various countries during this trip. He will also collect this information in China and will publicly broadcast his works after they are translated into Chinese. He is scheduled to go to Beijing the day after tomorrow.

### New No. 11 Textile Factory of China Textile Corporation: Old Workers Incite a Mob to Commit Violence

[Report from This Newspaper] The China Textile Corporation's No. 11 Factory on Yichang Road, Shanghai, No. 19 (formerly the Japanese-owned Naigai Cotton Factory No. 4) is currently preparing to resume production. Several days ago, five veteran workers, Sun Minhui, Chen Yunhui, Tang Guoquan, Ma Xinxiang, and Zhang Houkun, gathered more than 300 workers and marched to the factory in a column to demand that production be resumed. After failing to do so, they dispersed. At approximately 2:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, Sun and others gathered more than 100 workers again and went to the factory to take the same action. Factory Director Gong Difan sent personnel to conduct a detailed investigation and learned that among the more than 100 people, only five were veteran workers, and the rest were imposters. Therefore, he strictly refused them and ordered Commissioner Pan Ziping to go out and explain. Who knew that these workers would beat Pan Ziping into injury? At that time, the Putuo Road Sub-bureau reported the incident, and Chief Qi of the sub-bureau personally led a large number of police officers to rush to suppress it and rescue Pan Ziping from danger. The police arrested the perpetrators, Wang Dengjia, Yuan Bingkui, Zhou Denggao, Xu Shouyi, Li Fagen, and Yang Deming, for interrogation. They confessed to the violence. The perpetrators were handed over to the District Procuratorate today for investigation.

### Danish Con Artist Who Sold Jeeps Under False Name Has Been Arrested

[Report from This Newspaper] A Dane named Qinsheng, formerly employed by the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, has now become a vagrant due to unemployment. A few days ago, he falsely claimed to have a large number of Jeeps that would be shipped to Shanghai soon, selling each vehicle for only US$1,200. Three foreigners believed him to be true and successively paid him US$14,300. After Qinsheng obtained the money, he used US$8,500 to buy a Buick car (manufactured in 1942, with eight cylinders). At the time, he paid the car dealer US$6,000 (still owing US$2,500). He drove the car around every day, flaunting it as if he were a wealthy man. After a long time, the three foreigners realized they had been cheated and reported the information to the Municipal Police Bureau. The Foreign Affairs Group of the Criminal Police sent personnel to investigate and arrested Qinsheng in Room 406 of the Cathay Hotel the day before yesterday. They also found US$6,000 in the room, which was taken back to the police bureau together with Qinsheng. It is reported that Qinsheng is actually a big con artist. It is said that the number of Chinese people who have been similarly cheated is also large. They can report to the Criminal Investigation Section of the Police Bureau in Writing Room 402.

### Sino-Soviet Cultural Association Holds Soviet Farm Photo Exhibition

The photos in this exhibition are divided into two parts: more than 180 photos of collective farms and more than 100 photos of Soviet victory memorials. The composition and lighting are extremely beautiful, and the rapid progress of Soviet reconstruction work is especially worthy of our attention.

It is proposed to add two new *jia* [neighborhood units], designated as the twenty-third and twenty-fourth *jia*, with Zhang Hongchi appointed as the head of the twenty-third *jia* and Zhang Wengui as the head of the twenty-fourth *jia*.

The twenty-first district office (Xanshi Street) in this city, in conjunction with the local police station, held a meeting for *baozhang* [neighborhood chiefs] yesterday, deciding to conduct a random household census from August 21st to 25th.

The fourth district has received notification from the Civil Affairs Bureau that *baogan shi* [neighborhood affairs officers] are to be limited to males. Currently serving female *baogan shi* should quickly find ways to exchange positions with district office clerks or assistants. It has been found that Xi Tan Yun, the *baogan shi* of the nineteenth precinct, is female and has already exchanged with Zhou Xiong, the assistant in that district.

### Q&A on Ambiguities in Household Registration Laws (Continued)

(II) Types of Household Registration

(30) Question: Should single employees residing in various government agencies or public factories be registered as one household per person?

Answer: The *hu* [household] in household registration law is equivalent to the *jia* [family, home] in civil law. *Gonggong hu* [public household] is a term used within the *baojia* [neighborhood unit] system and cannot be used to change the criteria for establishing a *hu* in household registration. Therefore, even if people without kinship reside together, they should still establish separate *hu*.

(31) Question: How should the original place of registration ( *benji* ) of a concubine be recorded?

Answer: Since a concubine is a family member of the head of household, her *benji* should naturally be the same as that of the head of household.

(32) Question: Should a contact method be established between various registration books to facilitate investigation when natives, those with registered temporary residence, and migrating populations live together, cook together, and are registered separately?

Answer: Population changes should be registered separately in the relevant books and can be noted in the *baotian hukou ce* [land and household registration booklet] for easy cross-referencing. There is no need to establish a separate contact method.

(33) Question: How should the household registration of military personnel be recorded?

Answer: According to the Ministry's supplementary filling instructions, military personnel should be classified as "public service."

(34) Question: How should *tongyang xifu* [child brides] and nieces intended as brides be recorded?

Answer: They should be registered as family members, with a note in the remarks column stating "fiancée of so-and-so."

(35) Question: If a husband has been at war for more than five years and his wife has children with another man, how should they be registered?

Answer: This should be handled according to Article 1065 of the Civil Code.

(36) Question: Should household registration book numbers be compiled according to *bao* [neighborhood unit] or *xiangzhen* [township]?

Answer: Compiling by *bao* is smoother.

Question: According to Article 114 of the Household Registration Law, where should the words "concluded" be written?

Answer: It can be written in the margin for easy reference.

### Cotton Yarn Black Market Skyrockets During Textile Conference; Minister Says Textile Company Will Maintain Original Price, Company Says It Will Disregard Public Criticism

[Report from our newspaper] The yarn market soared again yesterday. Buyers were eager to purchase, but available stock on the market was extremely scarce. They were willing to raise prices to secure supplies. Prices for various yarn counts jumped by 100,000 [currency units], yet demand still exceeded supply. It is understood that yesterday's surge was due to yarn mills' insistence on not selling, unwilling to comply with the authorities' intention to sell at the market price before the exchange rate adjustment. They also dared not openly supply the black market. As a result, available stock became even scarcer, and merchants and cloth factories competed to acquire it.

The China Textile Construction Company held its eighth board of directors meeting yesterday at 3:00 PM. Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Yunwu and Vice Minister Pan Xulun personally attended and presided over the meeting, which lasted until 7:20 PM. Afterwards, Minister Wang answered questions from reporters from various newspapers. The details are as follows:

Minister Wang Says No Plan Has Been Finalized

The main task of this Textile Construction Board of Directors meeting was to discuss how to suppress the price of yarn and cloth. After several hours of discussion today, no concrete conclusion has been reached. Further consultation with the Textile Industry Management Committee is needed. The raw cotton used by Textile Construction to produce yarn and cloth is also partly sourced from overseas, so the result of the exchange rate adjustment will undoubtedly affect the production cost of yarn and cloth. However, the Textile Construction authorities are determined to do their best to maintain the original price without raising it.

(II) Regarding the question of how much Textile Construction is allocating, Minister Wang stated that when prices fluctuated slightly, applications for allocation purchases flooded in and the quantities requested increased sharply. Under the circumstances of unlimited demand and limited production, Textile Construction had no choice but to prioritize and allocate rationally based on urgency. There is no intention to reduce the quantity of allocations at a time when yarn and cloth market prices are high. Moreover, yarn and cloth are fundamentally different from grain. The demand for yarn and cloth is quite elastic, so the severity is secondary to the grain issue.

(III) Textile Construction General Manager Shu Yunzhang is currently inspecting the factories affiliated with Textile Construction in Qingdao and Tianjin. According to last month's report, the production quantities of the branch factories in these two regions have increased by 30% compared to before.

(IV) Regarding the export of yarn and cloth, the Ministry has considered two points: (A) It can be used for barter trade with various countries, for example, Vietnam is very interested in bartering rice and coal for our yarn and cloth. (B) Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia have a great need for yarn and cloth from the motherland, and this opportunity can be used to establish a market for domestically produced yarn and cloth in Southeast Asia. Therefore, the Ministry is currently considering the entire plan for yarn and cloth exports.

Company Indicates Prices Will Inevitably Rise

According to a report from the United Press, Textile Construction Deputy General Manager Wu Weijing said yesterday: In the past week, more than 200,000 bolts of cloth and more than 20,000 bales of yarn have been released, but the people of the whole country have not benefited in any real way. Only a few people in Shanghai can make undeserved profits without any capital after a warehouse receipt is issued. This phenomenon is truly unreasonable. The government's method of maintaining price limits is tantamount to encouraging speculation. The implementation of any policy requires the joint maintenance of all parties. The current strength of the China Textile Corporation is still small. If other manufacturers do not cooperate and take the same steps, the appetite of the black market is simply impossible to meet. The company has no choice but to disregard public criticism and adjust the distribution price in a flexible manner, taking into account the actual market situation.

Distribution Methods May Be Improved

According to a textile industry source, while the China Textile Corporation's listed prices remain stable, private yarn mills are still selling on the black market. A responsible person is considering unifying the distribution of goods from state-owned and private yarn mills. It is also said that the qualification of trading firms and out-of-town merchants to obtain goods will be re-evaluated. Factories will also review the qualifications for distribution based on their production capacity and manage the selling price of their finished products.

### Bond Market Unleashes Another Frenzy; "Tong Bing" Bonds Shout Out for the 2,000 Mark After Closing; Responsible Authorities Should Respond

Due to numerous discussions in the newspapers these days about the handling of pre-war debts, causing much speculation, the bond market was stirred up again yesterday. Several large firms in the "Five Flags" and "Seven Floors" districts jointly engaged in activity, and buying interest suddenly intensified. "Tong Bing" bonds opened high in the morning at 1,400 yuan, and after opening, buyers repeatedly competed to purchase, sending prices soaring. The market closed at a purchase price of 1,880 yuan, a sharp increase of 740 yuan compared to the previous close. After the close, prices continued to be bid up to around 2,050 yuan, making for an extremely enthusiastic scene. "Jia" and "Yi" bonds were pushed up from 770 yuan to over 1,000 yuan. "Tong Wu" bonds rose from 1,150 yuan to close at 1,600 yuan, resulting in gains of 40 yuan for "Jia" and "Yi" bonds compared to the previous close, about 500 yuan for "Ding" bonds, and 680 yuan for "Wu" bonds.

### Gold and Currency Stable

Yesterday, the market for bare gold was even more sluggish. It opened at 2.17 million, and the high price did not exceed 2.175 million. Many short-term traders, unable to hold their positions, began to close out. Shortly after 10:00 AM, the Central Bank sold 147 bars at a price of 2.155 million. Even at this point, the lowest price did not break 2.155 million. Afterwards, supply and demand balanced, and there were no special changes. At noon, the price struggled around 2.16 million. In the afternoon, it fell slightly below 2.16 million, resulting in a slight decrease of 7,000 compared to the previous close. Gold ornaments, silver bullion, and silver dollars remained stable. The interbank lending rate was slightly tight, with interest rates ranging from 1.2 to 1.5 *jiao* [cents].

Foreign currencies were generally stable. U.S. dollars were bought at 3,390 yuan and sold at 3,410 yuan. After opening, the price hovered between 3,380 yuan and 3,400 yuan until noon, which was sluggish. There was still no change in the afternoon, resulting in a slight increase of 5 yuan compared to the previous close. Hong Kong dollars were stable, struggling slightly around 750 yuan, resulting in a slight decrease of 5 yuan compared to the previous close. The Hong Kong exchange rate was also fixed at 750 yuan to 760 yuan, with continued transactions. Indian rupees were offered at 915 yuan, and British pounds were offered at 12,250 yuan. The U.S. exchange rate was still above the listed price, with designated banks engaging in transactions with each other.

### China Trust Bureau May Purchase Ping Shui District Export Green Tea at a Reasonable Price

(Report from our newspaper) Ping Shui green tea in Shaoxing produces a bountiful harvest. Although this year's new goods have already entered the market, due to low selling prices overseas and high domestic costs, transactions have not yet become clear. Tea merchants have repeatedly requested government assistance to reduce losses. It is now reported that the China Trust Bureau plans to purchase at a reasonable price in the near future. If the price of Ping Shui pearl tea is around 2.78 million yuan per *dan* [unit of weight], both tea farmers and tea merchants will benefit greatly.

Local export firms are seeing strong buying interest in green teas such as *chou zhen*, *xia mu*, *zhen mei*, and *zhen mei*, which are marketed in the Philippines and Africa, because the selling price of long-shelved old goods is still considered reasonable, and overseas demand is not waning. Taiwan fine black tea is being purchased continuously from Indian firms. Because available stock is low, sellers are pushing the price up even more aggressively. At present, it has soared to 120,000 yuan per *dan*. As for domestic sales of red and green tea, Tianjin merchants are not enthusiastic, but sales from other regions continue to be brisk.

### White Coal Prices Rise Endlessly

Due to transportation blockages from the Yangquan coal-producing region to Shijiazhuang and Tianjin, and the scarcity of coal in Tianjin, the arrival of goods in Shanghai has been affected. Holders of available stock are treating it as a treasure and are unwilling to easily sell unless they can get a substantial price. As a result, market prices have been rising steadily. Although the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Fuel Management Committee has ordered a large quantity of Hongji white coal briquettes from Annam [Vietnam], the goods will not arrive in Shanghai for about a month. At that time, market prices will certainly tend to fall back down.

### New Import Restrictions; Customs Has No Knowledge

(Report from our newspaper) A United Press dispatch from New York on the 22nd of this month stated: "American businessmen today received notification from Chinese customs stating that restrictions on four types of imported goods will become even stricter," etc. This newspaper considered the matter too bizarre and did not publish it. Yesterday, this reporter inquired about this news from a responsible person at the Customs Administration and the Customs Inspectorate General Li Du. It was said that they had no knowledge of this matter. Li also said that there have been no changes recently in customs regulations regarding various imported goods. It is reported that United Press sent another telegram from New York on the 23rd, stating that the news was issued by the "China News Agency" in New York (belonging to the Chinese Propaganda Department) and that the news came from Nanjing.

### Funds Exceed Available Shares; Chinese Stocks Soar Continuously

Buying interest in Chinese stocks suddenly increased, with Meiya [American-Chinese Company] taking the lead and advancing relentlessly. Various smaller stocks followed closely. Those less popular stocks with solid assets showed promise and continued to be sought after. Due to the limited number of shares, there were more monks than gruel, demand exceeded supply, and prices soared continuously. In the early morning, the low prices of various stocks were: Yongsasha 665 yuan, Meiya 3,930 yuan, Jingfu 243 yuan, Xinguang 255 yuan, and Dongxing 170 yuan. Afterwards, the market repeatedly improved, advancing under the leadership of Meiya. By noon, the high prices were: Yongsasha 700 yuan, Meiya 4,280 yuan, Jingfu 263 yuan, Xinguang 278 yuan, and Qinxing 200 yuan. The market stabilized slightly near the close, resulting in a slight increase of 15 yuan for Yongsasha compared to the previous close, a half increase for Meiya, and gains of slightly less than 10% to 15% for Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing. Less popular stocks were each up about 10%, and older stocks soared by 10% to 20%.

Foreign stock trading firms were watching, so the situation of the major stocks was stable. Smaller stocks continued to be purchased by Western merchant groups, progressing very quickly. Yisha fell from 9,300 to below 9,000 yuan, while British Union rose from 9,400 to 9,800. The smaller stocks rose sharply from the opening, all showing high prices. The results compared to the previous closing showed that Yisha was flat, British Union rose but had limited gains, Jardine Matheson, Butterfield & Swire, Shanghai Paper, Shanghai Steel, and Shanghai Brewery each rose by about half. Asia rose by slightly less than 10%.

### Jiangsu Provincial Government Decides Autumn Cocoons Will Be Worth Three *shi* of Rice Per *dan*

To prevent the price of autumn cocoons from being low and affecting the autumn cocoon harvest, the Jiangsu Provincial Government decided at its 51st routine meeting to stipulate that the standard price of autumn cocoons should not be lower than the price of three *shi* [unit of volume] of rice per market *dan*, to avoid losses to silkworm farmers and reduce their interest in silkworm breeding. This standard price is based on the calculation of 280 *jin* [unit of weight] of dried cocoons, 440 *jin* of reeled cocoons, and the elimination of double cocoons, thin-skinned cocoons, and other discarded cocoons.

### Large Quantities of Coconut Oil Arrive at Port

More than 5,000 barrels of coconut oil from Little Luzon [Philippines] have already arrived at the port. It is reported that the quantities arriving in succession will be very large. Coconut oil reached a price of over 300,000 yuan per *dan* in March of this year, but then plunged to 140,000 yuan due to the large quantities arriving in Shanghai. After the foreign exchange adjustment this time, it rose by 40,000 yuan. Now, with a large quantity of coconut oil arriving in Shanghai, prices are likely to fall again.

### Large Batches of Taiwan Sugar Arrive in Shanghai

Two Ships with American Cotton and Wheat Also Arrive at Port

[Report from our newspaper] The Fulai Shipping Company's *Edvard H.* arrived from McAllen, Texas, loaded with 8,000 tons of wheat, and is currently unloading at the Mitsubishi Wharf. The *Randalph Pickering* arrived from Melville Bay with 6,000 tons of cotton, approximately 13,000 pieces, and is docked at the Gonghexing Wharf for unloading. Taiwan and Shantou sugar also arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's *Hai Su* ship and Landing Craft 104 arrived in Shanghai from Keelung and Shantou, bringing 1,100 tons of Taiwan sugar, 500 tons of Shantou brown sugar, and 600 tons of porcelain.

### Rice Prices Increase, Second Grade Yellow Beans Surge and Then Slightly Retreat

Yesterday, 4,430 *shi* [unit of volume] plus 1,000 bags of customer goods were registered at the Nanshi market, and 2,139 *shi* arrived at the Beishi market. The Social Affairs Bureau sold more than 3,000 bags, totaling about 3,700 *shi*. The total for both the north and south markets reached more than 10,000 *shi*. There was no difference between *jengmi* [japonica rice] and *xianmi* [indica rice]. New *jengmi* rice was popular and quick to sell, while older rice was sluggish. New *xianmi* rice also increased and was quick to sell, while lower-grade goods showed fatigue. Only *baiyuan* [white round rice] was running out of stock and demand was strong, seeing an increase of 1,200 yuan. The supply and demand of flour was balanced, and the market trend was stable. Only miscellaneous high-grade flour showed a slight increase. Shantou wheat was moving but not strong, and the Ningbo merchants were fair, with the market trend secretly tightening. Interest from the north was easing, and white wheat was trading very little. Bran was selling in rural areas, and prices increased by 100 yuan. Although the arrival of yellow beans was scarce, after a sharp increase, the appetite of the shops eased, retreating by 1,000 yuan, forming a situation of a large increase and a small retreat. Raw peanuts remained strong. Yellow sesame seeds rose by 1,200 yuan. The oil market was flat and tired. The external appetite for soybean cakes has stopped, and there was no movement in rural sales, resulting in a sudden drop of 800 yuan.

### Chamber of Commerce Establishes a Branch Office in Gaoqiao

(Report from our newspaper) The commerce of Pudong has been most prosperous in towns such as Gaoqiao, Yangjing, and Dongchang. In recent years, Gaoqiao has become even more prosperous due to the large volume of import and export goods passing through. Local shops, recognizing the need for closer business connections, initiated the organization of a chamber of commerce. Representatives were elected to negotiate with the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce. The Chamber of Commerce also sent responsible officials to conduct on-site inspections. According to recent news, the Chamber of Commerce will approve the establishment of a branch office. However, the Pudong area is vast, with many towns, and the number of towns this branch office will govern is still under negotiation. It is heard that Dongchang and other towns have convenient direct communication with the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, so they will likely remain directly under the jurisdiction of the Chamber of Commerce and will not be subordinate to the branch office. Pan Jueshen and other commercial leaders in the area also intended to organize a branch office, but because the Chamber of Commerce did not want to establish multiple branch agencies, and because Pudong is only separated by a river, communication is convenient. Therefore, this proposal has been abandoned. According to sources close to the Chamber of Commerce, Dongchang had such an organization during the occupation period, but with the current change in circumstances, it is no longer necessary. The branch office that Gaoqiao and other towns are planning to organize is only a temporary measure to remedy the current inconvenience of transportation for the more prosperous towns. Once transportation is convenient, its continued existence will be considered. The responsible officials of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce have also stated that the branch office is one of the Chamber’s office structure, under the jurisdiction of the Board of Directors. All matters must still be reported to the Board of Directors, and expenses will be allocated by the Chamber. Shops in various towns should directly join the relevant trade associations in the city, and then they can obtain contact with the Chamber of Commerce through the trade association. There are still many shops in various towns in Pudong that have not joined the trade associations, and they should be persuaded to join.

### The United States Revises Export Price To Prevent Overseas Inflation

[United States Information Service, Washington, 23rd] The U.S. Office of Price Administration announced that it has revised its regulations for pricing U.S. export goods, the purpose of which is to facilitate the pricing of export merchants. It does not however make any changes to the government’s pricing policies for export goods. The aim of the revision is to allow consumers in friendly countries to enjoy the same benefits under U.S. price controls as domestic consumers, and to prevent the price of U.S. goods in foreign markets from rising. Exporters selling goods to foreign countries will follow domestic price limits, with a reasonable profit, handling fees, and insurance costs added.

Also, the Bureau of Labor Statistics recently announced that the sale price of American food has increased by 31.3% since June 30, and has increased to more than 40% since Victory over Japan Day. In the week ending August 17, the sale price of food rose by 3.4%, and the sale price of grain products rose by 4.2%. The sale price of meat, dairy butter, butter, milk powder, and imitation butter continued to rise.

### British Newspaper Discusses New Exchange Rate: Best to Contain Flexibility; Repeated Devaluation Only Makes the Black Market Rampant

Reuters, London, 23rd - The authoritative British economic publication "The Economist" commented on the recent devaluation of Chinese legal tender, stating that a flexible exchange rate policy, that is, setting the exchange rate daily based on market realities, is the only viable principle in the current environment. If the Chinese government does not adopt this principle, the recent difficulties will inevitably repeat themselves. Before the pressure of fundamental inflation can be stopped and prices no longer continue to rise, allowing the currency to devalue again after a period of time will cause foreign exchange transactions to stagnate, or cause the black market exchange rate to deviate from the official exchange rate and rise. It is also doubtful whether the recent actions of the Chinese government can correct trade imbalances. To save face, there is essentially no difference between a 40% devaluation and a 50% devaluation. China may now find that not only has it failed to save face, but it has also cut off its nose [to spite its face]. The new exchange rate announced on Monday is not surprising, but what is surprising is why the Chinese authorities waited so long to announce it. When the method of 2020 legal tender to one U.S. dollar was announced in March, it was originally thought that improvements in domestic transportation and the import of foreign goods could reduce the shortage of goods in various ports, especially Shanghai. New taxes and tariffs would be able to stop the leaks in inflation, and domestic peace would also help restore credit. Unexpectedly, these expectations have not been realized, and the new exchange rate of 2020 quickly became impractical. This exchange rate was once higher than the open market price, but this should be partly attributed to technical improvements in the Central Bank's foreign exchange management law. As the pressure of inflation increased, the open market price soared, and the control methods were only sufficient to make the mandatory official exchange rate more harmful than helpful. Smuggling became rampant, and the authorities had no choice but to devalue the legal tender by approximately 40%.

### Plan to Reduce Interest Arrears; Handling Fees Will Be Cancelled; Plan Awaiting Approval from the Central Bank; Implementation Expected Around the End of the Month

[Report from our newspaper] It is learned that the issue of interest rates on interest arrears for customers of banks and money shops has been researched by a small group convened by the Bankers Association, which formulated a plan to cancel handling fees and uniformly collect 1.35 *jiao* [cents]. It is currently awaiting approval from the Central Bank. The implementation period is expected to be around the end of this month. According to money shop sources: Banks and money shops originally did not have a system of adding handling fees to interest arrears. A decision to add a handling fee of 100% of the interest arrears rate was made in February of this year. When it was first implemented, the banks and money shops often added 50% or 100% based on their own business situation, and it was not uniform. It was not until May that a uniform 100% was added. The interest rate for long-term interest arrears was 8 *fen* [cents] in June and July of this year, so after adding a handling fee of 100%, it was 1.6 *jiao*. To cancel the handling fee system and for ease of calculation, it is proposed to uniformly collect 1.35 *jiao*.

### Japanese Rayon to Arrive in Shanghai in Large Quantities

It is learned that 1.2 million pounds of Japanese rayon will be imported soon. Our government is currently discussing this matter with General MacArthur's headquarters, and it will still be handled by the China Trust Bureau through barter trade. The rapidly rising market price of domestic rayon will be severely affected.

Blue Tiles Fall

Yesterday, the market for bricks and ash was slightly weak. However, because of the decrease in actual sales of blue roof tiles, the price fell from over 400,000 yuan per 10,000 to 367,000 yuan. The market for cement was chaotic for a time, but has now returned to 8,500 yuan per bag.

Hardware Rises 20-30%

Among hardware, except for a few items that are still prospering, the situation is generally gradually stabilizing, with gains of about 20-30%. Dog-brand door locks are still being sold at the original price due to the factory’s painful supply. Many files have arrived, making it difficult to see improvement. Because the season for green silk cloth has passed, there are bids but few transactions.

### Minister Wang Hopes for Cooperation from Merchants and Businessmen; Silk Purchasing Policy Determined, Tea Policy Undecided; Loans Not Restricted; Enemy Factories Sold Separately

[Our Newspaper's Report] Minister Wang of the Ministry of Economic Affairs answered many questions from reporters yesterday. Apart from the cotton yarn issue, which is covered in a separate article, the other points are all important. A summary of his remarks is as follows:

(1) The modification of import tariffs is currently under consideration.

(2) It has now been decided that the Central Trust Bureau will purchase raw silk, and the purchasing methods have also been determined. As for whether to adopt a purchasing policy for tea leaves or a subsidy export method, a decision has not yet been made.

(3) In order to assist and guide private industrial and commercial enterprises in various regions, and to provide technical and methodological assistance, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has proposed to the Executive Yuan to establish industrial and commercial supervisory groups in various industrial and commercial centers across the country. Currently, these groups have not been established because the organizational regulations have not yet been drafted.

(4) Industrial and commercial loans, if of a legitimate nature and urgently needed, will still be considered for lending, and there will be no special tightening due to the adjustment of exchange rates.

(5) Regarding the sale of enemy and puppet factories, in addition to preferential treatment for 22 factories in the rear, which are currently being inspected and having contracts negotiated, a batch of enemy and puppet factories that have been offered for sale twice but have not yet been sold have been notified to the China Industrial Association and the United Association of Factories Moving to Sichuan and Guangxi, etc., requesting them to inform their member factories to visit the factories separately from August 15th to the end of August. September 1st to 5th will be the period for factories to apply for purchase. These two stipulated deadlines will be extended by five days each if required by actual circumstances.

(6) The Office of the Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Economic Affairs for Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui will be closed at the end of September. Unfinished matters are currently being expedited.

(7) This time, the government's adjustment of exchange rates was a unanimous request from the export industry and the industrial and commercial sectors. After consideration, the government believes that this measure is necessary and has resolutely implemented the adjustment. However, the implementation of national laws also relies on the assistance of the people. When I traveled to the UK in the past, I deeply felt that the success of price management in that country lies in the people's ability to strictly abide by and implement every word and phrase of the laws. After the government's adjustment of exchange rates this time, the cost of foreign goods will increase, which will inevitably lead to price increases. However, there is absolutely no reason for domestic goods to increase in price. Otherwise, the government will definitely take action. Currently, the state-owned enterprises are determined to maintain the original prices of their products and will not increase them. I sincerely hope that the people will fully assist the government in this decision to respect public opinion and implement policies.

### The Location of the Descendants of Zhuge Wuhou: The Undetermined Sino-Burmese Border, Kawa Mountain

— By Special Correspondent Zhang Shenglin, dated the 12th

People of the Yi and Kawa ethnic groups in Cangyuan, western Yunnan, recently sent representatives to Kunming to present border conditions to the Yunnan provincial authorities, and presented a "Benefit the Borderlands" banner to Chairman Lu Han. This reporter visited Luo Yaocai, the guide of the representatives, who provided detailed information about the Kawa area.

Kawa Mountain (referred to as the Kawa area) is located east of the Nu River and west of the Lancang River, bordering Myanmar to the west and connecting to Huanluo to the south. This area remains an undetermined Sino-Burmese border to this day. The main ethnic groups are the Kawa and Bai Yi. During the Sino-Burmese border survey, Han Hua Xiang, the deceased Dong Tusi (native chieftain) of Mengjiao in Cangyuan, said to the British: "My ancestors have guarded the border for the motherland for generations and have received the motherland's favor. Although our Yi and Kawa ethnic groups are backward border people, we are also East Asian Mongoloids. Our noses and eyes are different from your country. How can we be governed by foreigners and become sinners of our motherland?" This diplomatic statement is sufficient to prove the loyalty of the border people.

According to the discussion, the current Kawa area faces two serious problems: one is the migration of the Kawa people, and the other is the invasion of the Lao Kang people (savages). A small number of Han people who cannot survive in the interior often enter the Kawa area to live. They often use deception or extortion, causing the border people to suffer and migrate abroad one after another. Once they cross the Nu River, the British give them dozens of rupees and one or two oxen, and they can live and work in peace. Every year, about hundreds of households migrate for this reason. If this continues, the population of the border area will inevitably decrease day by day. This is one of the serious problems. The Lao Kang people (belonging to Myanmar), who are neighbors of the Kawa area, have superior firearms and new tactics, and often use guerrilla tactics to harass the border people, intending to occupy important strongholds in the Kawa area. Although a part of the national army is stationed in Hong and Meng, they feel quite troubled due to certain reasons, which makes the border people often feel uneasy. This serious problem cannot be ignored.

The terrain of the Kawa area is most dangerous at "Kongming Mountain," which has the potential of one man holding the pass against ten thousand. The mountain is about 5,000 feet above sea level. Looking around from the top of the mountain, the lands of the seventeen Kawa kings are clearly visible. Years ago, the British changed the name of this mountain to "Citizen Mountain," but the people in the area still use the old name. The Kawa people often say: "Our Kawa people are the descendants of Zhuge Wuhou. Zhuge Wuhou was a meritorious minister of China, so the Kawa people are naturally Chinese citizens." According to legend, when Kongming marched south, he camped in the Kawa area for several days, leaving behind a large iron cannon that has long been buried in the soil. Folk tales say that if there is an incident or struggle in the Kawa area, the cannon will make a sound first, and the length of the sound will indicate the scale of the battle. Although this is a superstition, it is enough to prove the border people's belief in Kongming.

The climate in the Kawa area is slightly hot, and without sudden dramatic changes, it is difficult to distinguish the four seasons. The average temperature in summer is around 80 degrees Celsius, and the highest point is no more than 90 degrees Celsius. In winter, it is above 30 degrees Celsius. The plants are mostly chestnut and fruit trees, with few pines and cypresses. The main agricultural product is rice, and no miscellaneous grains are planted. Mineral deposits are abundant but undeveloped.

The politics of the Kawa area are still ruled by individual kings. The more prominent ones are the kings of Banyang, Made, Molie, Yingen, Yonghe, Banhong, Jianlong, Bankang, Banlao, Tatian, Shaoqing, Yileng, Wusu, Gansan, Manhui, Yide, and Guanzhong. In addition, there are other titles such as small king and mountain official. Among them, the King of Banyang is the head of the seventeen kings, with a jurisdiction of about 60,000 households, and the most firearms and property. The next are the kings of Molie, Yingen, and Made, who are also very powerful. The kings are all hereditary, adopting a "select the eldest (son), not the capable" system. In the past, they fought each other, with the strong preying on the weak, forming a situation where each dominates one side, maintaining a primitive tribal life. Under the king's palace, there are large and small "Gongtou," equivalent to the Baojia heads of the Han people, who are all unpaid. The king's troops are scattered among the people, which is actually "soldiers in the border." The total population of the Kawa area is about 1.5 million, with an average of one gun for every five people. Ancient bows and swords are still their commonly used weapons. The kings do not work, and their task is to manage the people in their jurisdiction. Civil and criminal cases are all handled according to customary law. There are no prisons, only corporal punishment and fines. The kings live a simple life, and their clothes are not much different from those of the people. Their greatest enjoyment is to kill a few more cattle than the people. Among the seventeen kings, only the King of Banhong lives in a tiled house, while the others live in thatched houses. Although they already use bowls for eating, they still do not use chopsticks. Only the King of Banhong uses chopsticks. The reason for this is that the King of Banhong's wife is a Kunming woman, and many of her living habits have been Sinicized.

In the entire Kawa Mountain area, the Kawa people account for 80 to 90 percent, and they are divided into "wild" and "pure." The pure Kawa are slightly similar to the Han people. The wild Kawa retain the customs of ancient ethnic groups. They are warlike and have the custom of taking human heads. Every February and August, they use "chicken divination" to determine which direction is most auspicious, and then set off in large numbers to take human heads to sacrifice to the seedlings. Between Xin Difang and Yonghe King, there is a headhunting village. Wooden poles are erected outside the village, and after obtaining the heads, they are hung on the walls and wooden poles. Those with the best performance are given red headscarves. Among the wild Kawa, there is still human head compensation. For example, if ten human heads are needed for the seedling sacrifice next year, anyone who agrees to undertake the task can receive the full price in advance. If they cannot deliver the required number by the deadline, the heads of the undertaker's family members will be used as collateral.

The Kawa people do not wash their faces and use their fingers to eat. When the Han people taught them to use chopsticks, the Kawa replied: "We were born with five fingers for grasping food, which is already convenient. If the Han people use chopsticks and get into a fight while eating, they can poke eyes with the chopsticks, isn't that too barbaric?" The Kawa people like to eat smelly things, and the Bai Yi people like to eat sour things, hence the saying "sour Bai Yi, smelly Kawa."

The Kawa people have freedom of marriage. Men and women can get married as long as they are in love. The wedding ceremony is simple. Relatives give tea bran as gifts, and the host provides wine and food. Before marriage, men can talk and laugh with any girl. After marriage, they are strictly restricted. If they have a relationship with other women, they will be fined. Unmarried men like to play the three-stringed lute. If they are admired by a girl, they can live together, and their parents are proud of it.

The Bai Yi people can withstand the heat and live on the plains. They are harmonious in nature and speak fluent Chinese. The men are healthy and their clothing, food, and lodging are much the same as those of the Han people. The women are beautiful and superior to the Han people in the area. They wear skirts and short jackets, and 90% of them do not wear shoes or socks. They love cleanliness and bathe frequently. They like to dye their teeth black for decoration. They like to wear silver earrings, bracelets, necklaces, and small bells. Their language is clear and pleasant to listen to, which is unmatched by other ethnic groups. The languages in the Kawa area are Bai Yi and Kawa, with the former being more common and easier to learn. In recent years, Han-Yi trade and intermarriage have become more common, and the inland culture has been slightly introduced.

After the introduction of Christianity to the Kawa area, less than 1% of the people are literate. The Bai Yi people believe in Burmese temples, which are their educational institutions. There is one elder, several monks, and many young monks. Bai Yi men are sent to the temple to study Bai Yi literature (Bai Yi scriptures) when they are young. Every village of the Bai Yi ethnic group has a Burmese temple. Pure Kawa also have this temple, but the number is small. The Kawa people believe in churches and shamans. They do not seek medical treatment when they are sick. If the chanting does not cure them, they await their death. The power of the church in the Kawa area is very strong. During the Anti-Japanese War, the missionaries intensified their work and created the Kawa script, so that today, many people in the Kawa area can use this script to communicate.

There are no formal shops in the Kawa area. They hold a street market every five days. In addition to various daily necessities, cosmetics and food can also be purchased. The prices are extremely expensive, and the prices of supplies are very low. The purpose of the Han people who go to do business is to exchange for opium dross, so they sell the goods they bring at low prices, which naturally stabilizes the prices. Transactions in the Kawa area do not use banknotes, but still use silver dollars. In the areas of Banshan, Mandun, Nankanwu, Dazhongnong, and Xiaozhongnong, in addition to silver dollars, rupees are also in circulation. Before the Anti-Japanese War, Kawa merchants often went to Lashio to do business, and even went as far as Mandalay. However, since Myanmar fell, the commercial relationship between the Kawa area and Myanmar has come to a standstill.

Nan Tianfu, a representative of the Kawa and Yi ethnic groups, spent 19 days on his way from Cangyuan to Kunming this time. His main task was to express the will and recent situation of the border people, hoping that the inland compatriots would provide more guidance and assistance so that the border area could be developed as soon as possible. He also hoped that the local authorities would truly do the four words "Benefit the Borderlands."

### The Heroic Female Police Recruits

The graduation ceremony for the fourth class of police recruits at the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau Training Institute was held yesterday!

We know that our country's police administration is gradually improving. What is expected of these police recruits is extremely earnest, and there is especially a lot of attention on the female police!

Look! How heroic their appearance is!

Look! How much work and achievement they will unfold!

### Female Police Service Opens Up a New Atmosphere in Shanghai

Starting tomorrow, 60 female police officers will begin serving the citizens of Shanghai. These female police officers have all received junior high school education and have completed training at the Shanghai Municipal Police Training Institute with excellent results. In order to enable them to enrich their service experience, this service will still be treated as an internship, and they will not be formally employed until after four months. Yesterday afternoon, the female police officers had already moved into the Fuzhou Road Police Station and will be assigned to various branch stations tomorrow. Most of them are from Zhejiang, with sound physical condition and high spirits. Whether in attitude or training, they are incomparable to the female police of the past, and can be said to open up a new atmosphere in the city's police force.

### Xiao Shaohang's Footprints

— Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng, Shaoxing, 18th

While listening to the sound of the spring at Wuliting in Tianmu Mountain, Mr. Shen Chengzhang, a member of the Zhejiang Provincial Assembly, said to the reporter: "We are going to the Ning Shao area next time, would you like to go with us?"

At 7:00 am on August 16th, Mr. Shen Chengzhang, Yu Zhongji, Li Yizhi, Zhang Zichun, Brother Tian Dewan, and the reporter set off for Ning Shao. First, we took a train to Changxing Township, which belongs to Xiaoshan County. Many people were waiting there to welcome us. Then we went to Xijiangtang. A 71-year-old man explained how important Xijiangtang is, even saying that if Xijiangtang breaches, the Xiaoshao area will become a swamp, and any solid engineering of the Wen family will be useless. He further emphasized that this is the back door of Shaoxing and Xiaoshan, and is the water long wall defending Xiaoshao.

Rice and Wheat Harvests are Good, Cotton May Be Affected by Rain

He also led us to inspect the Pantou Panjian area, about three miles from the Tang. Most of the Pantou Panjian have become land, and Xijiangtang is also a muddy pond. It is conceivable that it is not as serious as the Haining and Haiyan sections, but the fact remains that it has been in disrepair for many years. The old man and the township chief then submitted a petition to Mr. Shen, requesting that the airport designated by the aviation authorities be exempted from development, and knelt down to express their sorrowful pleas. Mr. Shen and we went to inspect the designated airport. As we approached the designated location, many local women knelt down with incense and blocked the way. The township chief repeatedly shouted: "If you have any requests, send a representative. I cannot be responsible for such requests." Mr. Shen was compassionate and finally agreed to their request to transfer the matter to the aviation authorities before leaving Xiaoshan.

We changed to a large truck and went to Xiaoshan. It took less than an hour to reach the county seat. This place is already within the ancient Yue Kingdom, and the famous doctor Fan Li was born in Xixing Township, which belongs to the county. Although the county seat has also been destroyed by the enemy puppets, it is much better than Yuhang, Lin'an, and Yuqian. The county government is temporarily located in the home of a former pawnshop with a Nanmu hall. This shows the wealth of Xiaoshan County before the war and also shows that the damage was not very serious. Xiaoshan is dominated by agricultural products, with cotton and tobacco being the special products among agricultural products. The rice and wheat harvests are still good this year, but the cotton may be affected by too much rain, and the tobacco leaves are not as good as before. The output is probably less than 5 million tons of cotton before the war, and about 3 million tons of tobacco leaves. I asked the local people, and they all said that the most important problem now is riverbank collapse, which is said to have collapsed 520,000 mu. From February to August this year, it collapsed 88,000 mu, and about 70,000 people are in urgent need of relief. They hope that the government will quickly build embankments to defend against the water. Little do they know that it is absolutely impossible to change the course of the river unless the entire riverbed is stabilized. People in the county are requesting this because the government is now paying attention to building embankments and defending against water. Of course, riverbank collapse is a very serious problem, but stabilizing the riverbed is not something that can be done overnight, so simply building embankments and defending against water has lost its value of permanent effect.

Prices are Lower Than in Hangzhou, County Government Work Still Needs Efforts

Prices in Xiaoshan are already lower than in Hangzhou, and the people seem to be living slightly better than in Chu, Changhua. The county has highways and railways, and transportation is relatively convenient. However, when it comes to reconstruction, it has not yet reached the saturation point, because the people's lives are still much worse than before the war. The population is also smaller than before the war. Therefore, those who work in the county government should not only not be satisfied but also intensify their efforts. To be honest, the current stage of county government work in Xiaoshan is not ideal enough. For example, Xiang Lake, which is a relatively easy area to develop, can be used to raise fish and cultivate land by using the victims of riverbank collapse, and developed into a scenic area. The current situation is far from what the ancients described in their poems: "Spring is about to end in front of Beigan Mountain, A Zi goes to Caiyi Lake to pick water caltrop. Lotus roots and water caltrop leaves fill the lake, and the boat does not know where to go." Instead, it is a desolate sight, with weeds growing everywhere. This is the point where the work of the county-level workers is not ideal enough. But perhaps it is a matter of time.

After lunch in Xiaoshan, we drove to Shaoxing. Shaoxing is the ancient capital of the Yue King Goujian, and it is also the place where Yu the Great, who tamed the floods, died and was buried, and the place where Jin Wang Xizhi wrote the Lanting Collection and was buried. It is the hometown of revolutionary martyrs Xu Xilin and Qiu Jin, and the hometown of contemporary celebrities Cai Yuanpei, Shao Lizi, Lu Xun, Zhou Enlai, and Ye Zhuotang.

Shaoxing Suffered Less Damage, Population Only 840,000

The damage here is even less, and the city is as complete as before, but the population was 1.2 million before the war, and now it is only 840,000. The land area is 2.4 million mu, of which 2 million mu can be cultivated. There are 97 central schools, 507 national schools, and 3 private primary schools. There are 47,703 children out of school, 165,593 adults out of school, and 85,044 women out of school. The special products here are the famous Shaoxing rice wine, tin foil, freshwater fish, and silk. Before the war, more than 100,000 jars of wine were brewed every year, but now it has been sharply reduced to one-fifth, with only more than 20,000 jars. The raw materials for brewing wine are mainly glutinous rice and distiller's yeast, which are not produced locally but are made from glutinous rice from Danyang, Jintan, Liyang, Jiaxing and other places. In addition to the famous Zhuangyuanhong, Jiafan, Zhuyeqing, Shanliang, and Huadiao, Shaoxing rice wine also has a type called "Daughter Wine," which is the most intoxicating. It is said that wealthy families process and make a jar or several jars of wine after giving birth to a daughter, seal it tightly after brewing, and bury it under the soil of the road that must be passed at home, so that people trample on it. When the daughter grows up, the wine is taken out to entertain guests, and its color is very mellow, in order to win the praise of the drinkers.

The Problem of Tin Foil Workers Changing Careers Falls on the Administrative Staff

Tin foil is used for worship or burning incense. It is made by hammering a piece of tin into an extremely thin sheet and applying it to thin paper, which is then sold on the market. People in the north and south of the Yangtze River buy it and fold it into money ingots to burn to express their worship. Although this tin foil has a superstitious color, nearly 200,000 people depend on it for a living. The raw materials for tin come from Hong Kong, Yunnan, Tianjin, Jiangxi, Tunxi, Ningbo, and other places. At least 40,000 pieces of tin foil are exported every month, and up to 80,000 pieces. In terms of taxation, the county has a tax rate of 15 percent, and can collect at least 60 million yuan per month, and at most 180 million yuan, which shows its abundant income. Now the central government has recovered the unified tax, and the tax evasion is 60 percent. Many tin foil workers know that the times are becoming more civilized day by day, and this industry is not a permanent thing after all. Therefore, they also demand to change careers, but this responsibility falls on the administrative staff. It is said that Fan Li made a fortune by raising snails in Nanchi, and he gathered and scattered his wealth three times. This kind of fish pond area is about 100,000 mu in Shaoxing, and there are about 5,000 to 6,000 fishermen. Around 1921, more than 2 million jin of fish were produced. When Shaoxing fell into the hands of the enemy during the Anti-Japanese War, reconstruction was difficult after the Anti-Japanese War. It is estimated that 1,800 pieces of fishing gear were lost, and 80 to 90 percent of the materials were lost. All the fishing villages went bankrupt. In the future, we should actively support them and actively improve the methods of fish farming. Regarding silk, I have already mentioned it in the article "Everywhere Smoke, Hangzhou Silk Sales to the North are Hopeless." It is roughly the same as what I said.

Promote Goujian's Spirit, Strive for Opportunities for Recuperation and Education

We went to see the place where the Confucian Temple was performing when Shaoxing fell, where there were water prisons and dog torture grounds when the enemy was there, and we deeply felt the brutality of the enemy.

We also went to visit the Sanjiang Dam, where the Cao'e, Qiantang, and Qianqing rivers meet. It is said that the Sanjiang Dam was built by Tang Shaoen during the Ming Dynasty, and the local farmland and water conservancy benefited a lot. Therefore, there is a Tang Gong Temple building in the local area. The collapsed part has been repaired by the government, and the inclined pond 1.5 kilometers from Sanjiang Dam is also being renovated.

In Shaoxing, we went to the Fengyuting Pavilion of Qiu Jin's Martyr, "Autumn wind, autumn rain, sad to death," and to the Wanghaiting Pavilion, which can overlook the East China Sea. We visited the Yu Mausoleum and the Lanting Pavilion, and felt that it was necessary to renovate them. And the historically famous Yue Wang Mausoleum has been demolished by the Japanese and no longer exists. Yes, the spirit of the Yue King Goujian can indeed make the Japanese see and hate. As long as we maintain this spirit, we will definitely become rich and strong. But with the smoke of war in the country, how can we have time to recuperate and educate? We feel that it is necessary to rebuild the Yue Wang Mausoleum. Although this is not an urgent task, it cannot be said to be insignificant for the meaning and value of education.

### Reviewing the Problem of Long-Term Savings Before the War

— Shu Lu

After our nation's victory, economic recovery has not been standardized, leading to a daily decline in currency value. Compared to pre-war prices, some items are five thousand times more expensive, while others are ten thousand times more expensive. Consequently, the issue of repaying long-term savings and life insurance premiums from before the war has caused endless complications. Recently, there was a lawsuit where someone with a two thousand yuan savings deposit requested a three thousand yuan loan to pay off the principal and interest. The court ruled that they should be paid one thousand times the original amount (as reported in recent newspapers). It is rumored that financial institutions in Hankou similarly paid out pre-war deposits at five thousand times their original value last winter in a similar case. Long-term savings are mostly intended for living expenses. When the currency value drops to several thousand times less, it becomes almost impossible to survive. Therefore, to survive, people must struggle. If they cannot succeed through struggle, they resort to legal action, which seems natural. Furthermore, the government promulgated the Supplementary Regulations on Civil Procedure on December 18, 1945. Article 12 concerning pre-war legal acts states: "If, after a legal act is established, circumstances change due to reasons not attributable to a reasonable person, and this was unforeseeable at the time, and the original effect is manifestly unfair, the court shall fairly adjudicate, increasing or decreasing payments or changing other original effects." Therefore, legally speaking, fairness is the principle, and the original effect can be changed. Now, let's consider the issue practically. Should pre-war long-term savings and life insurance premiums be repaid according to the original amount, or should they be paid according to the increased currency value? If they are paid according to the increased currency value, first, do banks have the ability to do so? Second, should depositors enjoy this right? Third, will national economic recovery be affected? All of these issues deserve further review.

First, can banks afford to repay pre-war long-term savings at the increased currency value? Before the war, in addition to state-owned banks, most commercial banks in our country had capital of four to five million yuan (some had seven and a half million yuan), while others had only two hundred and fifty thousand yuan. However, the total amount of long-term savings for each bank ranged from fifty to sixty million yuan to eighty to ninety million yuan for larger banks, and one to two million yuan for smaller banks, approximately ten times the bank's own capital. In other words, the bank's capital only accounted for ten percent of the long-term savings. Therefore, the interests of depositors are more important and significant than those of bank shareholders. As for the total operating amount of each bank, some reached as high as one hundred forty to one hundred fifty million yuan to over two hundred million yuan, nearly twenty to thirty times their capital. These funds rely entirely on the fluid capital collected from depositors and entrusted to the bank for management. Furthermore, the investment avenues of banks and life insurance companies are mostly in real estate or foreign currency securities, or even self-operated factories, due to the long-term nature of the funds. Taking real estate as an example, a property worth only two to three thousand legal tender before the war now sells for five to six hundred taels of gold, which, calculated at twenty thousand legal tender per tael of gold, amounts to over one hundred million legal tender, approximately five thousand times the pre-war value. In addition, the current value of all foreign currency securities and self-operated factories has also increased by thousands, even tens of thousands of times compared to before the war. If the court rules to repay pre-war long-term savings at one thousand times their original value, banks and life insurance companies can easily meet the obligation by selling a small portion of their assets, without shaking their foundations.

Second, should depositors have the right to withdraw long-term deposits at the increased currency value?

The primary task of a bank is to regulate surpluses and deficits. It absorbs deposits, gathers fluid capital, accumulates small amounts into large ones, and provides financial assistance to agriculture, industry, and commerce for profit. Therefore, it regulates the surplus fluid capital of depositors and addresses the capital deficit of agriculture, industry, and commerce. It essentially acts as a trustee managing funds and distributing profits. Part of the earnings is used as compensation for the managers, and part is used as dividends for the depositors. This distribution is generally balanced, without being excessively burdensome or lenient. Before the war, China's finances were stable, and profitable businesses generated meager profits. Safe investments yielded only about four to five percent. Therefore, at that time, the interest rate for long-term deposits, depending on the duration, was as high as one point seven or eight percent to two percent, accounting for about forty percent of the profit. The bank, as the manager, accounted for about sixty percent of the profit and had to bear all expenses. This allocation of benefits was very fair, so depositors were happy to accept it without complaint. Furthermore, depositors who made long-term deposits generally had specific purposes: some relied on the interest for regular living expenses; some set it aside for retirement and funeral expenses; some saved it for their children's education. Once the currency value plummets drastically, what used to be one hundred yuan could support a child's education for a year, but now it's only enough to buy a notebook. Therefore, the intended purpose can no longer be sustained. Superficially, this may not seem attributable to banks and life insurance companies, but in reality, it is. The existing assets of banks or life insurance companies have increased more than ten thousand times compared to pre-war levels. Ninety percent of the original funds for these assets came from long-term deposits. At the same time, due to the increased value of assets, like other commercial companies, they have all increased capital and distributed stock dividends. Now that the shareholders, who account for ten percent of the operating capital, have enjoyed the right to increase capital and distribute stock dividends (in other words, profit-sharing), long-term depositors, who account for ninety percent of the operating capital, should rightfully enjoy the same right to share profits. Moreover, when depositors deposit their funds with the bank as long-term deposits, it essentially implies a trust for management. Sharing profits is their rightful entitlement. Therefore, banks and life insurance companies should not repay these long-term deposits at the pre-war currency amount but should pay them at the increased currency value. Otherwise, those entrusted with management would seem to monopolize the profits.

Third, will national economic recovery be affected? After the government established the legal tender policy in 1936, coupled with abundant agricultural harvests and active industrial and commercial activities, bank deposits suddenly swelled. At that time, one US dollar was worth only three legal tender yuan, representing China's economic golden age. Due to the abundance of bank funds, agriculture, industry, and commerce were given as much assistance as possible, and loans of tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of yuan were readily granted; loans of twenty to thirty thousand yuan were even more common. The banks' extensive assistance allowed agriculture, industry, and commerce to flourish, creating the pre-war economic golden age. The strong performance of national capital during the war of resistance can be traced back to this period, to the banks having sufficient funds to assist agriculture, industry, and commerce, thereby creating this robust national capital. However, the banks' abundant funds relied on small depositors' long-term deposits. Therefore, it is the financial industry that utilizes national capital, and it is the small, long-term depositors who gather it. The strength or weakness of national capital depends entirely on the efforts of those who gather it. After the Franco-Prussian War, France was able to quickly pay the indemnity and recover rapidly, thanks to the French people's efforts in saving. Now, although our nation has declared victory, economic recovery is still a distant prospect. National capital has become increasingly weak. The number of long-term deposits at banks may have increased, but the quality has inevitably decreased significantly. What used to be a common loan of twenty to thirty thousand yuan (now two to three hundred million yuan) now requires much consideration and is difficult to handle. As for loans of tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of yuan (now tens of billions to hundreds of billions yuan) deemed acceptable before the war, most banks no longer have the individual capacity to handle them. Although a large portion of the funds is still frozen, new long-term deposits are rarely made. It is impossible to provide as much assistance to agriculture, industry, and commerce as before the war. Long-term depositors, fearing that long-term deposits are like setting a trap for themselves, have become wary and no longer trust banks for entrusted management, instead engaging in their own speculation or hoarding. However, speculation and hoarding are investments that cannot produce anything, so the overall national capital is dwindling, not increasing. It should be understood that the financial industry has a responsibility to assist in the nation's economic recovery. The dissipation of national capital is a major obstacle to economic recovery. Therefore, for the sake of the financial industry, efforts should be made to encourage savings and attract fluid capital, to both enrich its own funds and help the nation's economic recovery. Paying back pre-war long-term deposits at the increased currency value is not only a way to encourage savings and attract fluid capital but also greatly benefits the function of our nation's economic recovery.

In summary, the courts have made clear rulings, and the facts are consistent with reason and sentiment. The impact on individual depositors is small, but the impact on the dissipation of overall national capital, which hinders national economic recovery, is significant. Our nation's financial industry has no shortage of wise individuals who will likely share this view. I offer my humble opinion in the hope of sparking further and more reasonable discussion.

(Author's Note): This article is limited to long-term deposits and does not discuss public bonds. However, recent court cases have caused a surge in public bond prices. We must understand that public bonds and long-term deposits are fundamentally different. The issuance of public bonds is due to the nation's urgent need for funds. Collecting taxes is too slow, so borrowing is necessary as an emergency measure, like emergency medicine. Funds are collected and immediately spent, unlike long-term deposits, which are managed by banks for profit. Moreover, national expenditures are ultimately derived from the people. Repaying debts at the increased currency value is equivalent to increasing the burden on all citizens. Therefore, valuing public bonds in terms of the increased currency value is neither reasonable nor justifiable. We should not be misled by speculators.

### Returning Home Armed: Tales of Ru River

— Tenth Day News Report, Zeng Xiong and Bai Ming

Months of hunger and cold, months of suffering, what unbearable times those were! During those days, wanderers dreamed of returning home day and night! Finally, that day has arrived. Indeed, that day was earned with blood!

On the morning of July 31st, along the road in the vicinity of Nantong West Park, fifty or sixty neat military trucks and more than twenty cars were densely lined up. As the morning light gently shone, many refugees were already gathering here one after another. The reporter was also among them, seeing many familiar faces, exchanging smiles with each other, it is not difficult to imagine how happy they were in their hearts!

Squads of strong soldiers also arrived here one after another. Under the command and allocation of the officers, they quickly boarded the trucks, their mission was to escort us back home.

At nine o'clock, the entire team was assembled on the trucks, and over two hundred refugees each entered the cars. At the front, more than thirty trucks filled with soldiers began to move forward, and our cars followed closely behind. Looking again at the back, the loud roar of the engines brought more than thirty trucks of strong soldiers.

The Tongru Highway, recently renovated, has not been completely paved, and the car jolted very badly when passing through low-lying areas. Along the way, road guards, armed with American-style carbines, were stationed on both sides of the highway. From the guard posts, one could see the dark faces in front and behind, covered with steel helmets, gripping the carbines nervously, seeing off our lengthy convoy with a solemn attitude. Two beetle-like armored vehicles, equipped with small steel cannons, patrolled back and forth from time to time. At each stronghold, large numbers of reinforcing troops could be seen, ready to be dispatched. For our return home, tens of thousands of friends in the army have worked hard. In the army, I thought about how we should pay them the highest respect!

More than ninety cars of all sizes, after passing through Dingnian Town, gradually accelerated and moved forward. The fields in mid-summer were still so simple, with high corn stalks and deep yellow rice ears, interspersed in a vast plain. In the car, witnessing those mature crops, knowing that this is a harvest year, but not seeing a single farming family busy harvesting. These crops abandoned due to the war, I think are still plentiful in China today. A country exhausted by the eight years of war of resistance, is still reenacting these tragic scenes amidst the calls for demobilization today, I can't help but curse reality!

Four or five miles away from Dingnian Town, this place was a battlefield for a seesaw battle just ten days ago. Entire rice paddies were burned black, and broken walls and ruins were visible everywhere. The remains of those who died in battle on both sides of the highway have not yet been buried. Exposed to the scorching sun, flies gathered and maggots wriggled, making it impossible to distinguish their faces, eyes, ears, nose, and other organs. Red and white intermingled, becoming a blurred mass. Waves of foul odors were sent into the nose, making one want to vomit. Although we in the car had prepared handkerchiefs smeared with balm as masks, it was of no use. In the unbearable stench of corpses, the cars passed through dust mixed with blood, stirring up heights of several feet. We proceeded for more than twenty miles, gradually seeing the several tall buildings of Ru City.

Main Points of Communist Army Actions: Forming Armies and Collecting Grain, Stopping at Nothing

When the reporter met with Mr. Zhong Xiangzhen, the captain of the Third Battalion of the Seventh Corps of the Traffic Police here, he told the reporter many things about the Communist army's indiscriminate actions in the Rugao area. The main points are roughly as follows:

(1) Organizing Militias to Serve as Cannon Fodder - Each township organizes a militia battalion, which has three companies, each company has three or four platoons, (that is, one platoon per Bao). In peacetime, they are used for sentry duty and gathering military intelligence. During wartime, the militia organization is used as a shock troop, charging in the first and second lines to deplete our ammunition and explore our troop deployment. Afterwards, the field army would pounce on our weaknesses. Moreover, whoever in the populace doesn't participate in the militia, their house will be sealed and grain fined (two Shi of barley). In the Dingnian campaign, there were as many as three hundred militiamen used as cannon fodder.

(2) Extensively徵收公糧, the People are Unable to Survive - The annual taxes are collected twice in the summer and autumn. The summer tax is wheat, and the autumn tax is rice seeds. The highest amount per Mu is 14 Jin. For every Jin of grain, a half Jin of grass is also taxed. It is estimated that each village (Bao) has about a hundred Shi.

(3) Confiscating Property of "Counter-revolutionaries," Enriching Private Pockets - Anyone who has held a position in the "puppet" regime for even one day will be punished. All of their property will be confiscated and said to be distributed to the common people, to help the poor turn over, but in reality, the township and village chiefs have made a fortune, and the common people are still at a disadvantage.

(4) Using Others to Kill, Harshly Punishing Traitors - When a traitor is arrested, a public trial is convened. Clearly wanting to kill him, they feign asking the public whether they want to kill him or not. The masses are merely puppets, how dare they shout "Don't kill"? Therefore, they say that this is the opinion of the masses, not the government wanting to kill. Another type is that a wooden sign is hung around the neck called a "Traitor" sign, weighing about three or four Jin. The sign says "Traitor who sells the country, so-and-so." They are confined to their homes, called "sitting in the people's prison," for a maximum of ten years. They are also ordered to wear the sign, red clothes, and a tall hat every day, doing hard labor such as cleaning streets and toilets. If they go out without wearing the sign and red clothes, they will be beaten at any time.

(5) Inciting Tenant Farmers, Mistreating Landlords - They organize peasant associations and turn-over associations to settle accounts with landlords. The rent exceeding the 25% rent reduction before 1937 that landlords charged is collected, and the rental deposit paid by tenant farmers when renting land is returned, forcing landlords to clear out all of their fields. This is called the "Overturning Rent and Interest" movement. If the landlords refuse to do so, they will smear Tung oil and lime on the landlord's face, tie him up, wear a tall hat, and beat him along the village, or erect a high platform and instruct the landlord to stand on it and wave his hand, shouting, "Save me, Old Central Government," etc.

(6) Distributing Land According to Population, Issuing Grain Based on the Number of People - Each person is allocated land to cultivate, and the grain harvested is handed over to the public. Then, the public issues grain according to the population. This makes the people indifferent to diligence or laziness, resulting in the abandonment of fields and reduced production.

(7) Banning Monks and Nuns, Prohibiting Ancestral Rituals - They force monks and nuns to grow their hair and return to secular life, marry wives and husbands. All ancestral rituals are strictly prohibited.

(8) Listening to Walls at Night, Smelling Fragrance in the Daytime - They organize listening groups to secretly listen for counter-revolutionary remarks at people's homes at night. They organize smelling teams during the day. If they smell fragrance (such as meat or fish) from someone's home, they go to that house to inquire about the reason for eating meat or fish. Besides asking people to intercede, they will suffer interference.

(9) Banning Matchmakers, Promoting Elopement - When men and women reach adulthood, if a matchmaker introduces them to marriage, pork will be hung around the matchmaker's neck, saying that they are people who like to eat, that's why they are matchmakers. Their meaning is that as long as both men and women agree, they can become husband and wife.

(10) Mobilizing Children to Confront Respected Relatives - They organize children's groups, which, in addition to helping the militia stand guard, specialize in confronting stubborn parents. If a child is punished by a parent, the entire children's group will confront them.

(11) Falsely Claiming Democracy, Practicing Dictatorship - Their government's organization is the "Three-Third System," that is, the Nationalist Party occupies one-third, the Communist Party occupies one-third, and non-partisans occupy one-third. In reality, the Nationalist Party will be judged for being Kuomintang spies, and non-partisans will be judged for being non-partisan, so officials in all departments must be Communist Party members.

(12) Selling Out the Motherland, Allowing Themselves to Be Driven - They fundamentally lose the position of the Chinese nation, believing that everything in the Soviet Union is good. For example, they sing the Soviet national anthem and hang the Soviet flag at meetings.

Communist Party Cadres Realize Their Mistakes, Painfully Correcting Their Past Misdeeds

According to recent news, many enlightened individuals have realized that if they continue like this, it will be detrimental to our nation and people. Therefore, they have realized their mistakes and are correcting their past misdeeds. For example, Lou Ji, the political instructor of the Seventh Company of the Communist Army's Rugao Guard Regiment, is one example. Lou Ji is 24 years old and lives in Tuliu Township, Dingnian District, Rugao County. According to what Mr. Lou himself wrote on July 27th: "When the Japanese devils invaded northern Jiangsu, I lost my chance to study (I was 16 years old then). At 22, I went to teach in southern Rugao. Because that place has very deep red ideas, the main activist was Hu Yunqiu (party name Lin Lin). Due to being tempted for a moment, in the autumn of that year when I was 23 years old, I joined the Communist Party (party name You Xian). Later, I also joined the Seventh Company of the Rugao County Guard Regiment as a special affairs officer. This year, I was promoted to lieutenant instructor, specializing in liking to attack in the dark, attacking small units. If they encounter a large number of troops, they fly away like sparrows (called "sparrow warfare"). The army is divided into field armies and local forces. This area belongs to the Central China Military Region. The commander is Su Yu, and the political commissar is Deng Zihui. There are a total of nine columns, scattered along the Longhai Railway and the Jinpu Railway. The current focus is on the land redistribution movement, allocating one Mu of land to each person, abolishing the Baojia system, and establishing a village and group system completely based on people as a unit, not bound by family, in order to create a society of struggle." Finally, he said: "Only under the leadership of President Chiang can all parties and factions become a strong country. Therefore, he is now willing to sincerely repent, painfully correct his past mistakes, and, under the government's good education, become a good young man again."

### Answering Readers' Questions: Legal Queries

(1) Absolute Sale with Redemption

Zhao Zechang asks: (A) Brothers Jia, Yi, and Bing divided their household early on. After Jia passed away, his son, let's call him someone, was of a corrupt nature. In the 20th year of the Republic [1931], he absolutely sold some of his farmland to his uncle Bing. At the time, due to their familial relationship, the price was slightly raised, and it was stated that redemption would never be allowed, with a contract drawn up to that effect. Later, Bing also passed away, and the farmland was divided among his sons and grandsons. Now, this year, farmland prices have soared, and the seller and his son believe there is profit to be made. They are seeking to redeem the land from Bing's sons and grandsons at the original price. Please advise:

(1) Since it was an absolute sale, does the law allow redemption? (2) They claim that there is no absolute sale between relatives. Is there any legal basis for this claim? (3) They are using force to coerce. Can Bing's sons and grandsons file a lawsuit according to law?

(B) Four brothers, Jia, Yi, Bing, and Ding. Jia has two daughters, Yi has one son, Bing has four sons, and Ding has one son. Later, Jia, Yi, Bing, and Ding all passed away, and their property was divided equally. Because Jia had no son, according to custom, he was succeeded by Bing's son, let's call him someone. Jia's property was given to Bing's son someone alone. Please advise: (1) Is this type of inheritance legal? (2) Jia's daughters are Jia's own children. Do they have any right to inherit? (3) Since Jia's daughters have no property to gain, can they file a lawsuit to recover property from Bing's son someone according to law?

[Lawyer Duanmu Kai's Response] (A) (1) Redemption is not permitted by law. (2) There is no legal basis for this. (3) They may seek redress through legal action.

(B) (1) Inheritance through the ancestral line was abolished with the implementation of the inheritance section of the Civil Code on May 5th, the 20th year of the Republic [1931]. If it was after the aforementioned date, then inheritance by Bing's son has no legal basis. (2) Jia's daughters certainly have the right to inherit. (3) They can sue for recovery on the grounds of infringement of inheritance rights, but they cannot exceed the time limit stipulated in Article 1146, Section 2 of the Civil Code.

(2) Husband's Affair

Xiujuan asks: (1) I have been married for 30 years and have six children. Now my husband is living with another woman. What crimes have been committed? Can I file a lawsuit according to law? (2) If my husband runs away with another woman, abandoning his family, can I file a lawsuit according to law? (3) If we declare a divorce, who should the children, house, and miscellaneous items belong to? (4) What are the costs if I file a lawsuit? (5) Abortion is not allowed by law, but the woman fears that she will be abandoned by the man later, and they made an agreement. If the woman sues according to the agreement, is it legally valid?

[Lawyer Duanmu Kai's Response] (1) You can sue according to Article 239 of the Criminal Code, provided that the statute of limitations in Article 216 of the Criminal Procedure Law has not passed. (2) You must be able to prove the fact of abandonment. (3) Regarding the custody of children, refer to Articles 1055 and 1051 of the Civil Code. Regarding the house and miscellaneous items, except for the separate property under Article 1013 of the Civil Code, they belong to the husband. (4) Refer to Article 12 of the Civil Procedure Costs Law. (5) If it can be proven that there was coercion, then the man can be exempted from responsibility.

### Rickshaw Puller Flees with Goods

Lost Item, Reward Offered for Return of Goods: To the esteemed readers, I arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing on the 16th of this month with the intention of taking a boat to the Northeast Railway Reclaimed Area. At around 10:00 AM that morning at the North Station, there were three rickshaws. Two were loaded with luggage, and I rode in one. Unexpectedly, while traveling to the intersection of Henan Road and Nanjing Road, due to traffic congestion, the last rickshaw went missing. The rickshaw was carrying two large yellow leather bags and two willow baskets, containing single-layer cotton clothing for men and women, as well as blankets and wool coats, etc. In total, all the clothing for men and women has been lost. I am now stranded in Shanghai and unable to return home. I have long known that your newspaper is enthusiastic about serving the community. I would like to request that you consider my misfortune and publish this in the community service section. I earnestly request that any kind gentlemen who find these items (or if the rickshaw puller's conscience is pricked) deliver the items to my residence, and I will immediately reward them with 400,000 yuan in legal tender.

If you agree, I will be eternally grateful. Respectfully, Li Benxuan, August 17th. (Current residence: Northeast Fellow Townsmen Reception Center, Fuyuan Hall, Meijia Street, Penglai Road, Nanshi)

### Agriculture, Forestry, and Water Conservancy in Hebei

— Special Correspondent Yang Bingsen, Reporting from Baoding on the 11th

The northwestern and southwestern parts of Hebei Province are mountainous, with high terrain, making them good forest areas. The southeastern parts are loess plains, with fertile soil, primarily focused on agricultural production. The region is quite rich. However, due to the devastating wars in recent years and frequent natural disasters, the rural economy has been bankrupted. At a time when agricultural recovery is the current priority, the construction of farmland water conservancy is a prerequisite. Therefore, I am reporting on the agricultural situation in the province for your reference.

(1) RenShou Area Restoration: The RenShou Canal was decided upon for construction in the 22nd year of the Republic [1933] by the Hebei Provincial Government in conjunction with the North China Water Conservancy Commission. It draws water from the Hutuo River to irrigate farmland in Lingshou, Zhengding, Xingtang, Xinle, and Huolu counties, totaling approximately 380,000 mu. The Hutuo River Irrigation Project Commission was established, and the project was carried out in accordance with the prescribed procedures. By May of the 34th year [1945], the northern section was scheduled for completion, irrigating 137,000 mu of farmland. However, the work was halted by the outbreak of the July 7th Incident [beginning of Second Sino-Japanese War]. The southern section was never started. Now, the entire canal has been almost entirely destroyed and is unusable. It is proposed that the Hebei Provincial Government, in conjunction with the North China Water Conservancy Commission, continue to repair the canal, or cooperate with the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to build it using a work-for-relief method. Once this project is completed, the expected benefit is that it can irrigate 380,000 mu of farmland, with an estimated increase of 100 jin per mu, resulting in an annual increase of 38 million jin of agricultural products.

(2) Restoration and Dredging of the Fuyang River Gate: In the 20th year of the Republic [1931], the provincial authorities built five gates near Handan on the Fuyang River, controlling the Yongliu Canal in 21 counties, benefiting 134 villages and irrigating 1,500 qing of farmland. Most of it has now been destroyed. The Hebei Provincial Government should not only repair the original gates and canals, but also build new canals. The expected benefit is that it can irrigate 200,000 mu of farmland, with an estimated increase of 100 jin per mu, for a total increase of 20 million jin.

(3) Construction of the Xingzhi Canal and Land Improvement: The canal was built by the Xingzhi Water Conservancy Company, organized by businessman Yu Zengyi in the first year of the Republic [1912], in contract with the provincial government, using water from the Yongding River to irrigate 40 qing of farmland. The provincial government plans to restore the canal to its original state in the near future. As for land improvement, river water has been used in the past to desilt and deposit sediment to improve soil quality, changing some soil into good farmland. For example, the Xiaozhan rice paddies in Tianjin were converted using this method. During the Anti-Japanese War, the Japanese also experimented with this in various coastal areas of eastern Hebei, with significant results. However, after the victory, most of the coastal areas were occupied by the Communist army, and most of the original equipment was destroyed.

Establishment of Water Conservancy Agencies

The Yongding, Daqing, North-South Canal, and Hutuo rivers are the biggest problems in Hebei Province. Even a slight mountain flood or heavy rain can cause flooding, inundating farmland and displacing people. This year, several river embankments were quickly breached by the Communist army, causing artificial floods. After Hebei's recovery, river affairs bureaus were established for each river, specializing in prevention, emergency repairs, embankment construction, and water level checks. In addition, each river bureau plans to be responsible for the construction of water conservancy projects in the future, so that the banks of the rivers will not only be free from floods, but also irrigate the fields on both sides, which will greatly benefit the region.

Ten-Year Well-Drilling Plan

Hebei Province has many plains, which are suitable for cultivation. However, the soil is loose, with a lot of fine sand, which is easily permeable. It is also affected by the continental climate, and rainfall is often insufficient in the spring. In the autumn, there is abundant rainfall with uneven distribution of drought and flood. Therefore, the current work of well digging is a necessary supplement. In the past, well digging in Hebei Province was quietly promoted in Qingyuan, Dingxian, Xinle, Xingtang, Zhengding, Ningjin, Gaoyi, Baixiang, Yaoshan, Neiqiu, Shahe Yongnian counties along the Pinghan Line, Nanpi, Ningjin counties along the Jinpu Line, and Fengrun and Sanhe in eastern Hebei, with good results. Among them, Dingxian has the largest number of wells, with a total of 19,979 wells, followed by Wuji County with 11,983 wells, and Xietai with 6,037 wells. The irrigated land in Dingxian accounts for about 30% of the county, and 70% in Wuji County. But all the wells are old-fashioned, small wells with depths of 5 to 10 meters. Therefore, promoting the digging of new wells is an urgent matter. Hebei Governor Sun also listed the digging of new wells as the central task of this year, and decided to use the following methods: 1. Rotary drilling machine method. 2. Cable tool method. 3. Rock core drilling machine. 4. Manual auger, to be adopted separately. The Hebei Provincial Government also formulated a ten-year well-drilling plan, which will be implemented on schedule. The plan is briefly described below:

Phase 1: Demonstration Phase (Year 35 [1946]) During this phase, a training institution for drilling machine technicians will be established, but it cannot be applied immediately, so large-scale work plans cannot be carried out. Only well digging can be promoted in suitable areas, and trial digging will be carried out in counties with convenient transportation and quiet environments, such as Baoding, Tangshan, and Dadao, as well as cotton-producing counties. If the diameter of each well is 110 meters, and the average flow rate of each well is 3,000 to 1,000 tons per day, it can irrigate 4 to 10 qing of farmland. After this phase is completed, more than 200 qing of farmland can be irrigated at any time, and will no longer be threatened by drought.

Phase 2: Promotion Phase (Year 36 [1947]) During this phase, well-drilling teams will be established, and 500 drilling machines will be purchased and distributed to 15 well-drilling central areas to carry out work. They will be distributed equally according to the cultivated land area of each county. A total of 342 wells will be dug throughout the year, and some wells will also be dug in cotton-producing areas to increase cotton production.

Phase 3: Universal Phase (End of Years 37 [1948] to 39 [1950]) During the first year of this phase, the well-drilling teams will purchase another 500 drilling machines, bringing the total to 1,000. They will continue to work in the 15 areas, digging 6,042 wells with a depth of 80 meters throughout the year. In the second year, 1,000 drilling machines will be purchased, and 12,042 wells will be dug throughout the year. In the third year, another 1,000 drilling machines will be purchased, bringing the total to 3,000. Working at the same depth and speed, 18,042 wells can be dug throughout the year.

Phase 4: Completion Phase (End of Years 40 [1951] to 44 [1955]) With the existing drilling machines, 90,210 wells with a depth of 80 meters can be dug in the five years of this phase. Together with phases 1, 2, and 3, it is possible to complete 129,423 deep wells in the province in ten years. The daily flow rate of each well is 2,000 tons. By the end of Year 44 [1955], 647,115 qing of farmland can be irrigated. However, the cultivatable land in Hebei Province is 866,098 qing. After the completion of this ten-year plan, four-fifths of the province's fertile land will no longer suffer from drought. In addition, embankments will be built along the banks of the rivers to store water, and at the same time, people will be encouraged to build earthen wells or dig springs in areas with shallow water levels, such as the Taihang Mountains, to supplement the lack of well digging. Therefore, the drought disaster in the province can be solved in ten years.

The cost of the ten-year well-drilling program is estimated at US$43,418,070 for machinery in the spring budget of this year. The cost of the well-drilling work team is 1,447,400 yuan (national currency). The amount of loans that the well-drilling work team should give to farmers is 1,873.22.050.200 yuan (national currency). The well-drilling pump is 4,193,305,200,000 yuan (national currency).

Promote Afforestation Movement

The distribution area of natural forests in Hebei has been over-felled and reclaimed for thousands of years, as well as suffering from man-made disasters such as grazing and burning. There are almost no primeval forests left. What exists today are only a few scattered natural forest remnants. According to a survey by the Hebei Provincial Department of Construction, there are: 1. Changli Forest: area of 150,000 mu; 2. Eastern Mausoleums Forest: area of 575,000 mu; 3. Western Mausoleums Forest: area unknown; 4. Western Shunde Forest: area of 7,000 hectares; Forests in Miyun, Xianghe, Wanping, and Fangshan are smaller in area. As for man-made forests, there are: 1. Xishan Afforestation: area of 170,000 mu; 2. Liulihe Dongfang Afforestation; 3. Coastal forest for wind and sand protection in Qinhuangdao; 4. Afforestation near Beidaihe and Luanhe; 5. Afforestation in Eastern and Western Mausoleums. In summary, the area of forest maintenance is 630,307 mu, the area of flood control forest is 257,992 mu, the area of windbreak forest is 383,513 mu, and the area of health forest is 82,420 mu. The forest area is decreasing every day. Therefore, after the enemy surrendered, Hebei Province only worked hard to promote the afforestation movement in the more than 40 counties that were recovered, but the results were minimal. All levels should jointly protect the trees, plant new forests, and mobilize everyone to implement them together in order to develop them. The provincial authorities should also prepare a detailed plan to achieve the goal of greening Hebei.

Locust Plague Numbers are Alarming

Hebei Province has suffered from locust plagues for many years, resulting in huge losses. For example, in the 18th year of the Republic [1929], 124 counties in the province suffered from locusts. At that time, the loss was 45 million yuan. In the 28th year [1939], 29 counties suffered from locusts, with a damage area of 3.9 million mu. At that time, the loss was 7.7 million yuan. In the 29th year [1940], 72 counties suffered from locusts, with a loss of 5 million yuan (the above are statistics from the Hebei Provincial Department of Construction). In early June of this year, locust nymphs were discovered in the Junliangcheng and Yangliuqing areas. The loss of wheat fields in the area was reduced by about 40%. When the writer wrote this manuscript, locusts were also discovered in the suburbs of Baoding. In two days, 500 mu of farmland was lost. Therefore, Hebei Province immediately established a locust control committee to be responsible for handling all locust control matters. The expenses have been determined as 668,400 yuan for the provincial regular expenses, 2,820,000 yuan for the project expenses, 254,000 yuan for the county locust control regular expenses, and 1,310,000 yuan for the project expenses. It is estimated that all 132 counties in the province (currently only 42 counties) will need 206,508,000 yuan per year.

In summary, the authorities in Hebei Province are quite determined to build agriculture. Under excellent natural conditions, the failure to promote it smoothly is entirely due to the man-made security situation. Therefore, for the above plans, the reporter sincerely hopes that the government and the people will unite and work hard for the province and the country to truly implement them, so that everyone can share the joy of wealth and abundance!

### Recent Conditions in Yaojiang, Wang Yangming's Hometown

Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng, Reporting from Yuyao on the 18th

On the early morning of the 18th, our group set off towards Yuyao. The verdant fields and distant rolling mountains made people feel relaxed. After passing through several small mountain passes, someone said that this was where bandits used to rob people, but after passing the mountain passes, there was another large area of farmland. I really didn't believe that this was a place where bandits roamed.

Dredging Cao'e River, Repairing Sea Dikes

We arrived at Cao'e Town. Cao'e was a filial daughter from the Han Dynasty. Her father drowned in the river. She cried all night and jumped into the river to look for her father. As a result, Cao'e found her father floating on the water. In the end, both father and daughter died. Later generations changed the name of the Shun River to Cao'e River to commemorate her, and there is Cao'e Town on the bank of the river. We got off the car, crossed the river, and on the other side was Baiguan Town. It is said that King Yu once summoned officials here for a meeting, hence the name. According to the locals, there is also a large Shun Temple here. Shangyu means the legacy of Shun's son. Originally, the Cao'e River was called the Shun River, which was also in memory of Shun. This is already the boundary of Shangyu. Shangyu has 306,709 people, 42 townships, and the entire territory is mostly mountainous. The special products are cotton, glutinous rice, tea, yangmei, and iron sand. According to county government personnel, the most urgent need at present is to dredge the Cao'e River, which can benefit farmland, repair the sea dikes to protect the coastal county, and build a highway from Baiguan to the county seat to facilitate commercial transportation. Now, to get from the county seat of Shangyu to Baiguan, you have to walk dozens of miles of small roads, so it is natural to open this road.

We got in the car and continued forward, and saw a tall mountain far to the right, large, majestic, and lying there. This is Siming Mountain. According to the local people, there are mountains within Siming Mountain, with majestic terrain, which is a place where bandits hide. The unrest in Yuyao, Shangyu, and other places can be said to have started from Siming Mountain.

After traveling 40 kilometers, we arrived at Yuyao. This is the hometown of the famous Chinese philosopher Wang Yangming, and also the hometown of Yan Ziling in the Han Dynasty, and the old home of Mr. Zhu Shunshui and Huang Lizhou of the Yaojiang School in the Ming Dynasty. We saw that Yaodi is indeed a place of beautiful mountains and rivers, with the Yao Ting running through it, and two other rivers embracing each other, with verdant mountains, which is delightful. Inside the county government here, there is a stone tablet erected with the inscription "Hometown of Four Lights." There is also the Fangjie Pavilion, where a "boot" is placed, to commemorate that when Magistrate Wang left the county, the people were reluctant to let him go, so they left a "boot" as a souvenir. There is a plaque placed next to the "boot" with the inscription "The People Cannot Forget," which shows that the people of Yuyao can indeed recognize good officials.

Salt Industry Representatives Go to the Province to Petition

Yuyao is also a cotton-producing area. Although the fiber is not ideal enough, there is still a lot to be done if it is well improved. The most important issue at present is security, because the southern part of the county is one corner of Siming Mountain. Thugs often come in and out, and these thugs incite farmers and gang up to cause trouble. Therefore, to eliminate the bandits in Siming Mountain today, we must start with politics and also with patient persuasion. Another problem is the dispute over the salt farms. Yuyao's salt was originally supplied to the entire province of Zhejiang, and also to the people of several provinces including Anhui, Jiangxi, and Jiangsu. The annual output is more than 200 dan. Originally, there were manufacturers who came to buy salt. The manufacturers negotiated with the directors, the directors then negotiated with the pong chiefs, and the pong chiefs then negotiated with the pong households, who were the salt farmers. There was a tacit agreement of preferential treatment between the manufacturers and the directors, but the salt farmers were pitiful, living under exploitation. There are more than 20,000 salt farmers here, and including their families, there are more than 100,000 people in total. Before the war, Yuyao's salt farms had a farm magistrate. Later, through the efforts of the county government personnel, this bad system was improved. The magistrate was changed to a farm manager, and there was no need for the directors to act as intermediaries. The salt farmers sold directly to the salt merchants, but habits are not easy to change overnight. In fact, there are still many difficulties. A year before the Anti-Japanese War, merchants bought salt at a 40% discount, which aroused the opposition of the salt farmers. Later, it was purchased without discount. Today, it is no longer a salt merchant system, but is handled by the Salt Affairs Administration. It is said that recently the Administration is afraid that the purchase price is too high, affecting exports, so it has lowered the purchase price, and the salt farmers demand a price increase because their lives are difficult to maintain. This has been insisted on until now, and has not yet been resolved. The people in the salt industry in the county have sent representatives to petition the Provincial Salt Administration, or even to Nanjing to petition.

The method of making salt here is still the old method from thousands of years ago. The salt tanks are made uneven. After the tide comes, seawater is put in. After the tide recedes, the soil is scraped up, placed on a pile, and water is poured into the salt cave. Then the brine is poured into a jar, taken out later, and placed on a salt slab to let the sun dry and whiten, and then it becomes salt.

The lives of the salt farmers are miserable. They live in thatched huts that are not tall enough, and they eat porridge. If they don't find a way to improve, Yuyao's salt has little hope. We hope that the Salt Administration will not only purchase salt, but also provide technical guidance and improvement, so that the lives of the salt farmers can reach a standard, so that they can be held responsible.

We went to visit Mr. Yangming's former residence. There is only a newly built stone archway of the Earl. The houses have disappeared. Climbing Longquan Mountain, we first arrived at Longquan Temple. This is a building from the first year of Guangxu of the late Qing Dynasty. The temple is in very good condition, and several nuns manage the temple. Following the small road next to the temple, we climbed up the mountain to Longquan Academy. It is said that Wang Yangming, Zhu Shunshui, and Huang Lizhou all lectured here, but according to the county chronicle, it was built by Liu Changcheng, the county magistrate during the Qianlong period. There is also a horizontal plaque in front of the academy, but the buildings inside the academy are only remnants, with tiles all over the ground. Recalling the site of the former sages has become a wasteland, which is regrettable. People on the mountain said: "This was destroyed by the enemy." Thinking of the enemy's intentions being so vicious, how can we let them off the hook?

To the right of Longquan Academy is the Xie Gong Shrine, which was the Grand Secretary in the Ming Dynasty, and to the right is the Yan Gong Shrine, where the portrait of Mr. Yan Ziling is sculpted, but the color that was applied is already mottled. Only a few sparse beards remain under Mr. Yan's chin. The shrine door has been destroyed, and only a few women making tinfoil are still making tinfoil, accompanying Mr. Yan's desolate loneliness. A few steps away is Longquan, and the spring water is still clear.

Climbing uphill again through the weeds, we finally saw Yangming Shrine, which was also dilapidated. The stone statue of Mr. Yangming was taken away by the Japanese, and now only the stone table and stone seat remain.

Looking out from the top of Longquan Mountain, Siming Mountain stands in the southwest of Longquan Mountain. Yaojiang is like a belt, and Yuyao County is nestled at the foot of the mountain on both sides. Seeing this river and mountain scenery, we know that talents are emerging, and we hope to build it well to inherit the legacy of the former sages.

### Review: "Paradise Yearning for the Mortal Realm"

— Guan Yu

Yue Opera's "Paradise Yearning for the Mortal Realm" is a historical drama, but I do not wish to prove its historical value. Therefore, I will not comment on whether this play has any historical authenticity. I only want to discuss its performance aspects and whether the actors have portrayed the characters' personalities.

Apart from spoken drama, film, dance, and music, I do not enjoy watching any form of variety drama. However, after arriving in Shanghai, I unexpectedly watched Yue Opera's "Xianglin Sao" and this "Paradise Yearning for the Mortal Realm." Considering the status and position of local opera, I must objectively admit that "Xianglin Sao" was an excellent performance because the content of the play it portrayed was meaningful. However, what is in this "Paradise Yearning for the Mortal Realm"? Does it depict wealthy young men playing with vulnerable young girls? Or does it depict love that cannot be shared, or the thoughts of a jealous woman? If none of these, what else can be said? If "Yearning for the Mortal Realm" is its theme, then the play does not depict why she yearns for the mortal realm, the motivations for "yearning," and her previous state of loneliness. Therefore, we can say: "Paradise Yearning for the Mortal Realm" is a play without a complete theme.

I find that the set design has improved compared to "Xianglin Sao." In "Xianglin Sao," the set design was inconsistent; here, it is unified. However, unifying the set design does not necessarily mean success, because the atmosphere of each scene is not evident. For example, the second act is meant to depict Yu Xuanji's reception room in the brothel. This scene does not allow us to see that it is a high-class brothel. If we did not read the description, we might easily mistake it for another place. Another example is the fourth act, which is meant to depict Yu Xuanji as a female Taoist, living in the practice room of Xianyi Temple. In the scene, we also cannot see that it is a place of cultivation. If the description stated that this scene was a brothel, it would not be inappropriate! These can be said to be the two most obvious and important environments in the entire play that represent the different identities of the protagonist. But unfortunately, the set designer and director did not pay attention to this.

Actors · Already Stereotyped ·

Yuan Xuefen plays Yu Xuanji. She wrote in the program of "Xianglin Sao" that she only plays a certain type of "woman." That is to say: apart from this type of "woman," all other roles are beyond her ability to play. The so-called personality is non-existent. Therefore, I do not wish to demand much of whether the personality she portrays is authentic and whether it is concretely expressed! However, in the playwright and director Hong Jun's article "How 'Paradise Yearning for the Mortal Realm' Was Written," the personality is written very clearly. He writes: "She has an excessively high ideal, and all her hopes for life are built on this ideal. She underestimates reality, ignores reality, and as a result, reality brings her pain… She has lost the passionate (perhaps a question of 'emotion') and frank heart of a young girl, and replaced it with the cold and perverse nature of a young woman… She does not pursue vanity, she only hopes too much, and never fights against the evil forces of society. She initially ignores them, then avoids them, and eventually becomes eccentric, and finally commits crimes." Although the playwright explained that this is such a personality, I did not see that the actor's acting skills were able to express these personalities in the play. The Yu Xuanji that Yuan Xuefen introduced to us is only a pitiful worm who is deceived and played with! I did not see a trace of the parts of her personality such as ignoring reality, the passion of a young girl, the nature of a young woman, and becoming eccentric. Therefore, if we do not talk about "woman," but talk about personality, then Yuan Xuefen is a complete failure. To put it harshly: Yu Xuanji's achievement is only two or three tenths of Xianglin Sao's. The director also has to take responsibility for this. No matter how popular this actor is, she should be given strict guidance so that she can achieve even more! Because this is not a personal matter, but the glory of the entire Yue Opera community!

The music this time is much better than the soundtrack for "Xianglin Sao." Although it is still so simple and the tunes are inconsistent, it has already complemented the plot, and it is not the chaotic mess it was before.

Many advanced individuals have said it is good, which is encouraging these rising and promising artists from the standpoint of advanced individuals! It is not an expression of satisfaction with these Yue Operas that have not yet caught up with the highest artistic standards!

### Actors and Performances

— Ye Zi

Drama is a comprehensive art. Playwrights, directors, set designers, musicians, costume designers, and actors each present their artistic power in the entire performance, so that the art of drama can be further developed and the effect of the drama can be expanded.

However, these participating departments do not appear for personal expression, but for the collective expression of a satisfactory dramatic effect. If any part takes the creative duty for itself, it will harm the creativity of other components, and the drama will lose its fluency, roundness, and freedom; closely related to this, it will lose its persuasiveness to the audience. Each department participating in the artistic process can only engage in creation freely and without restraint within the conditions limited by the rules of dramatic art, and only with the active cooperation of other art departments can the drama obtain a structural harmony and integrity.

If the playwright insists that the script can only be appreciated by silent reading, then the script becomes unstageable and is no different from other literature. If the stage artist expresses "single will," then the drama becomes a picture for people to watch, and the actors become puppets. If the director satisfies "self-ideas" and enforces dictatorship, then the actors become machines, and the drama becomes a tasteless labor. If the star monopolizes the drama, then the other actors are sacrificed, and the audience will not be able to see the entire script in the performance. Therefore, this product of deformed individualism, any part that infringes on the creation of other parts for single self-satisfaction, will cause damage to the entire drama or reduce the artistic level.

But one point should be noted, that in the performance, playwrights, directors, stage designers, musicians, etc. do not directly appeal to the audience, but speak to the audience through the actors. Each technology gives its thoughts to the actors, so that the actors can realize them, otherwise these thoughts will never be alive. The words of the playwright, if the actors do not give them life, do not make them their own language, will still be dead things. A beautiful set placed on the stage, if it has not been touched by the actor's body and senses, will also become lifeless, because it is all given life on the stage, which is dramatic and meaningful. Therefore, a script is different from a poem or a novel, a stage is different from a painting, a stage installation is different from an architectural project, and stage music is not the performance of other music. When each art participates in the creation of drama, it must fall in love with the conditions of drama and perform a dramatic function. In completing this function, each art has a new nature, that is, it has a nature of dramatic purpose, and it must meet the needs of dramatic action, so it is different from their original specialization. Therefore, when each department of the performance participates in the dramatic work, they have to change their original independent faces, and adapt themselves to a department of drama. They not only indirectly express the content, thoughts, and emotions of the drama, but also help the actors' performances, set off the plot, increase the success and effectiveness of the performance, and make the expression of the drama richer, more complete, and more beautiful. They are unified and melted into a whole, which becomes inseparable. Therefore, today's actors can no longer exist independently from other departments of stage art, and they have become an indispensable element in theater art.

The author intends to divide the progress of teaching Kunqu Opera into twelve equal parts according to the different methods of composing music and music scores. Namely, 1. Southern Melody Sanban, 2. Southern Melody One Beat Three Eyes with Gifted Beat, 3. Southern Melody One Beat Three Eyes without Gifted Beat, 4. Southern Melody One Beat One Eye with Gifted Beat, 5. Southern Melody One Beat One Eye without Gifted Beat (the above all include Southern Collected Melodies), 6. Southern Melody Flowing Beat, 7. Northern Melody Sanban, 8. Northern Melody One Beat Three Eyes, 9. Northern Melody One Beat One Eye, 10. Southern Melody Suite, 11. Northern Melody Suite, 12. Combined Southern and Northern Melody Suite.

The above twelve equal parts are the names of the twelve chapters of the book "Kunqu Opera Teaching Manual" planned by the author. Each chapter selects four or five relatively common melodies as examples. Each melody selects at least two or more songs for comparison. For those with the same poetic title and melody title, first record a poem to clarify the differences between the poem and the melody, and the process of entering the melody from the poem, which is one lesson. The lyrics and Gongche notation are the main text. After the main lesson, add notes and explanations on the relevant terms and theories in this lesson, and list several practice questions for practice.

Compiled in this way, the whole book will have about sixty lessons, recording one hundred scattered songs and fifteen complete suites. To get a glimpse of the whole picture of the sea of songs, although it is only a millet in a great warehouse, the format of these hundred songs and fifteen suites should be familiar. As for the method of making the score, each melody records two or more songs, which can be compared and obtained. From this, further step into the second, third, fourth, and even dozens of cycles of study, the scholarship of songs is not difficult to explore.

The first chapter of this book, Southern Melody Sanban, plans to record the melody titles Partridge Sky, Inviting Gold Gate, Recalling the Bridegroom, Red Monk Robe, and Not the Road as examples, divided into five lessons, of which the first three are Southern Song introductions, and the last two are Southern Song interludes. Now the first lesson is prepared as follows:

First record the Song Dynasty famous courtesan Nie Shenghuan's Partridge Sky Farewell Song, and use the "〇" symbol to represent the flat tone, the "×" symbol to represent the oblique tone, the words that should be flat are marked with the "〇" symbol on the left of the word, the words that should be oblique are marked with the "×" symbol, the words that can be flat or oblique are marked with the "×〇" symbol, and the places that should rhyme are marked with rhyme, and the places that do not need to rhyme are marked with sentence. Then record two Partridge Sky songs from the Pipa Record Nanpu fold and the Purple Hairpin Record Yangguan fold and compare them. The Gongche score is noted on the right side of the lyrics, and the four tones of flat, rising, going, and entering are noted on the left side, with the "十" symbol as the Yang tone symbol and the "一" symbol as the Yin tone symbol, such as Yang Ping tone as "十平", Yin Ping tone as "一平", Yang Going tone as "十去", Yin Going tone as "一去", and so on. The sentence rhyme is the same as the poem. However, because the song has filler words and the poem does not, all filler words are written in small letters next to them. The following is an example:

Poem Partridge Sky Farewell 情

Jade pale flowers sad out Fengcheng (rhyme) Lotus Tower under willow green green (rhyme) Before the cup sing Yangguan song (sentence) Farewell to others fifth journey (rhyme)

Looking for good dream (sentence) Dream hard to come true (rhyme) Someone

Who knows my feelings at this time (rhyme) Tears before pillow rain before steps (sentence) Separated by a window dripping until dawn (rhyme)

From Partridge Sky one, Nanpu

Only fear ten thousand miles of mountains and rivers ten thousand miles of sorrow (rhyme) The same thoughts the same worries (rhyme) Mulberry Elm twilight should be difficult to protect (sentence) How can the guest house scenery stay for a long time (rhyme) There (sentence) Slowly concentrate (rhyme) Just as the horse walks ten steps nine times turning head (rhyme) Returning home only afraid of hurting relatives' intentions (sentence) Holding back tears vaguely dare not flow (rhyme)

Song Partridge Sky two, Yangguan

Cover the remnant tears send you on the seven fragrant car (rhyme) Guarding the dream of husband and wife jasper dwelling (rhyme) Wishing you to ennoble tour painted brocade (sentence) May I be chirping birds falling flowers beginning (rhyme) The dry riders hold (sentence) Ten thousand people support (rhyme) Rich and noble heroes beautiful husbands (rhyme) Teach him to close the river everywhere to rest the enemy sword (sentence) Post road meet people number send book (rhyme)

From the above popular poem and two songs, comparing and observing, the similarities and differences between the poem and the song rhythm can be seen. Partridge Sky is composed of two seven-character quatrains, only the first seven-character sentence of the second quatrain is split into two sentences of three characters each of flat oblique oblique and oblique flat flat, which is the same for both the poem and the song. The song can add filler words but the poem cannot, which is the first difference. The song is still true and straightforward, and is known for its original language, while the poem emphasizes rhetoric, which is the second difference. The poem is the author's work to express personal emotions, while the song speaks for the characters in the play, which is the third difference. Although this is the most initial, most superficial, and most obvious understanding, by reading more works by famous people, you can try to compose music.

### Dog Star Lassie Travels Thousands of Miles to Find Young Master

— Yin Huai

In the county of 克郡, England, there was a child who had a beautiful dog named Lassie. They depended on each other and were as close as siblings. Every day at four o'clock in the afternoon, when the child was dismissed from school, Lassie would instinctively go to pick him up and bring him home. However, one day, due to unemployment and poverty, the owner sold it to the Duke. What it encountered was no longer warmth and love, but iron cages, iron chains, and brutality.

It struggled to escape, once, twice. Finally, although it was taken to Scotland, it finally broke free from the clutches of the Duke's servants. For the sake of its old master's attachment, it did not care how far the distance of more than a hundred miles was, and drove towards its hometown. This was a difficult journey, wading through towering mountains and rapid rivers. Thunderstorms, thugs' hunting, dog catchers' chasing... it ignored everything and just moved towards its hometown.

Finally, at four o'clock in the afternoon one day, dragging its lame front foot and tired, dirty body, it returned to the old place under the shade of the school tree, waiting for its young master who greeted it with tears.

This is really a touching film. What the child gave was friendship and warmth, and what Lassie repaid was loyalty. You see, as long as it has one breath left, this ambition will not change. What kind of difficulties can stop it, and what kind of petty favor can stop it along the way. The center of gravity of the entire play is concentrated on Lassie, the dog star. It is indeed very good at acting. It performs disappointment, fatigue, dying, serious injury, and other postures naturally and realistically, like a great actor.

The pictures are extremely beautiful. The quiet English countryside, thunderstorms, sunrises, waterfalls... add a lot of poetic and artistic flavor to the whole film, adding emotion.

United Artists Film Company's authority film "The Sword Man of Troubled Times" is Little Fan Pengke's proud masterpiece. One person plays two roles, and appearing swords in the same shot at the same time is an unprecedented spectacle on the screen. The plot of the whole film is enthusiastic and compact, and the past martial arts films that have been shown cannot compare to it. The film is scheduled to be shown simultaneously at Hu Guang Xin Guang on August 27.

### Current Spoken Drama

— Qian Fu

Yesterday, I talked to a theater friend about the phenomenon of spoken drama. Everyone felt that the crisis of spoken drama had really come. Because every performance is shouting about losing money, and because of losing money, it is impossible to make spoken drama performances anymore. Therefore, it affects the survival of spoken drama.

As long as we open the newspaper to take a look, there are more than a hundred theater groups in Shanghai. Only a little less than one-tenth of these hundred theater groups are spoken drama groups, and the others are just Shanghai Opera, Yue Opera, National Opera, and some are even things like滑稽戏and 摊簧. Then, why is it only spoken drama that loses money? Why can other inferior theater groups stand up instead? The reason is very simple, because they are just playing with the audience, catering to the audience, or peddling sex and low-level interests, making it easy for ordinary citizens to be intoxicated in their boring interests. And what about spoken drama? It is a serious, high-level, in-depth, and truly artistic work that walks in front of the times, and the ticket price is relatively high. Ordinary citizens cannot easily accept its art, nor can they afford tickets to enter the venue. Therefore, every performance of it will lose money.

That friend said: Shanghai theater friends choose a script, the first step is to see if there is a business eye. And the first eye of the theater friends from Chongqing when choosing a script is to ask if the consciousness is correct. There is a difference here, so Shanghai friends can earn gold bars by playing Autumn Wind Opera, while most of the theater groups from Chongqing lose money. I don't know if this is reliable, but I think the reason is not starting after the victory. As early as under the control of the enemy and the puppet regime, these theater friends had to do so, otherwise, the Japanese would invite them to jail. It is said that the performance of "Metamorphosis" was ordered to stop. Over time, spoken drama audiences have been cultivated to only seek eye comfort, regardless of whether their brains are empty. Therefore, there is such a crisis in performing drama in Shanghai now. Some spoken drama audiences in the era of enemy and puppet regime cannot accept the current drama performances with profound consciousness, and have changed their style and ran to the cinema to watch American movies. Some audiences who are not interested in foreign films and have a lower level have also run into the Yue Opera and 滑稽戏 venues. The number of audiences in the spoken drama venue has decreased!

Although spoken drama is so depressed, we these spoken drama workers, except for a few, still do not want to change our style and make performances that lower the standard!

The pieces that are particularly good are still few, and there are none that can surpass "A Dog's Devotion."

Judging from the director of 滑稽戏 films, this film is well-chosen, but the actors are not exciting. Abbott is tough, and Costello is still the same old thing, but the jokes happen naturally. When the two eat a snack together, Costello's first order is very good, but the next few times are a bit superfluous. The news film "World's Largest Engine Airplane" shown before the film is very good.

Liu Bie has not shown any characteristics in this film, and the colors are also very ordinary. The scene of the opening Hades is indeed very good in color, and Tang Yamanchi coming from afar is not bad. However, it is better not to shoot the "King of Hell" head-on, because taking more back shots can achieve a greater effect.

The female role, Queen Thani, performed better than Tang Yamanchi, and grandfather却尔斯可本was very good.

Although the director pressed the atmosphere of the whole film too heavily, the handling was not bad. John Garfield's self-talk in the train window is also very novel, but no very prominent points were found.

The actors in the whole film are all trying their best, and John Garfield has many facial close-ups, which are still competent. Marlene Ola is more successful than "Blood Sea Contending Heroes", and 탈스 리査 is also quite good.

The shortcoming of the whole film is that because the director presses the play very heavily everywhere, it lacks the characteristics of ups and downs. The screenwriter's clues are lacking in strength.

却尔斯劳顿 did not achieve much in this film, that is because the director could not provoke 却尔斯劳顿. The whole film should have a lot of inner drama to watch, but as a result, very little was seen. Both the screenwriter and the director failed, only the last scene of surrendering in front was photographed well, and the subtitles of his film came from this transformation, so it is not bad.

Bai Beilan Stanfei is another style in this film, and the performance is not bad, it is indeed an old qualification. The scene of talking with Michael Xia next to the wine cabinet is brilliantly performed. The clues of the whole play are still not strict, and the director's techniques are also lacking in change. Michael Xia did not succeed.

However, from this film, we can see that the "low level" on the American drama scene is not inferior to our "civilized play."

The best actors:

(1)却尔斯劳顿, in "Killing Wife News"

(2)白蓓兰史丹妃, in "Theatrical Gossip"

(3)约瀚迦飞尔, in "Deep Abyss"

Spring and Autumn

### A Record of Zhang Dinghe's Concert

— Zhao Jingshen

The Zhang family is a family of literature and art enthusiasts. Their ancestor, Zhang Shusheng of Hefei, was a high-ranking official in the late Qing Dynasty. Therefore, they are a so-called scholarly family, with a tradition of intellectual talent according to genetics. There are four elder sisters in the family: Yuanhe, Yunhe, Zhaohe, and Chonghe; and six younger brothers: Zonghe, Yinhe, Dinghe, Yuhe, Huanhe, and Ninghe. The sisters all have two-legged names, and the brothers all have "bao gai tou" (radical signifying "roof") names. During the Anti-Japanese War, the siblings moved around to various places, but still compiled and copied publications, taking turns mailing them. I worked with Zonghe at Lihuang Anhui College for a year and a half, and saw their family publication "Water." It contained poems written by the second sister, who suffered from homesickness and used it as the theme. Shen Congwen, the husband of the third sister, and his child Huchu also had major works in it. At the end of the book, there were rules: 1. Whoever receives the publication must attach their recent work to it; 2. After the publication arrives, please send it to someone within a week. This was indeed very interesting. Now that the Anti-Japanese War has been won, the siblings have all come to Shanghai and held a banquet for the ten siblings. Because I had been a teacher of Zhaohe and Zonghe (teaching them the principles of the novel and modern world literature at China Public School), and I was also a music friend or member of the Rainbow Society with Yuanhe, Yunhe, and Chonghe, I had close relationships and was also invited to join. Dinghe even took several photos.

On the 20th, Dinghe held a song concert at Yiyuan, inviting his friends to listen to the music. Zonghe had long told me that his younger brother Dinghe was very famous for composing songs in the rear. At first, he only liked Western music, but later he actually came to like Kunqu Opera, feeling that Kunqu Opera also had its merits. Zonghe, who is currently the principal of Suzhou Leyi Girls' Middle School, also rushed to attend the concert. The eldest Chonghe is still in Suzhou. She has a great understanding of Kunqu Opera music theory and is rare among female Kunqu Opera enthusiasts. Her performances of "The Interrupted Dream" and "The Complaint with Incense" are both excellent. When she was in Chongqing, she performed "School" and "Garden Stroll" in a charity performance to raise funds for the National Compilation and Translation Bureau.

My wife and I went together and saw that Zheng Zhenduo, Li Jianwu, Xu Diaofu, Wu Zuguang, Ding Cong, Li Yifengzi, and others had arrived. Shen Congwen and Zhaohe stood on the spectator's platform, saying they were learning to be hosts.

The drama interludes sung that night included: Guo Moruo's "The Flowers of the Tangdi," Tian Han's "Resurrection," Wu Zuguang's "Ode to Righteousness" and "Phoenix City," Xian Yiqiao's "Yue Fei," Ostrovsky's "The Thunderstorm," and a certain Mr.'s "Great Qian Mountain." Among them, I liked Tian Han's lyrics the most. The lyrics for "Great Qian Mountain" were written by Yunhe, "The water of Chaohu Lake is clear, the peach town is red with blood flowers." She probably suffered from homesickness again in Chongqing. Wu Zuguang's "Ode to Righteousness" uses the words of Niu Xiji's "Sheng Zhazi."

I am completely an amateur when it comes to music. Congwen said that Dinghe is a music enthusiast, and I believe that someone who is enthusiastic must be skilled. Songs like "Please Don't Act So Soon," "Late Spring at Hou Lake," "Ode to the Artistic Trenches," and "Great Qian Mountain Chorus" all sounded very good. "The Good Old Days of Jiangnan" depicted the transition from joy to anger, and "Homecoming Journey" depicted a happy situation, all of which can be expressed through musical scores.

I have three hopes for Dinghe: First, create instrumental pieces that are not limited by the singer's intonation and wording. Second, compose more musical pieces that express "the expression of power," showing masculine beauty. Third, next time you hold a concert, the number of choir members must be increased as much as possible; two or three people seem too monotonous.

The poems and lyrics sung this time included Yue Fei's Manjianghong and the new poet Chen Mengjia's "Swallow." Qian Feng's prose poem "Mother's Heart" is a very good satire for those who "forget their mother after having a wife," and the concept is also clever.

I think the tenor Zhu Chongmao sang very well. The soprano Zeng Xianen also sang not badly, but it seemed not bright enough, perhaps limited by the score. Chongmao changed "time" (時光) to "time" (時間), which rhymes with "later" (晚一點). I don't know if this song "Please Don't Act So Soon" is entirely rhymed with Jiangyang.

Huanhe, Yuhe, and Yunhe all wrote lyrics, while Yuanhe, Zhaohe, Zonghe, and others served as hosts. It can be said that all ten Zhang siblings were mobilized.

After performing for a large part of the evening, Lü En also rushed to listen. Recently, Lü En, in Nanjing, for Zhou Yan's (He Mengfu's revised) "The Peach Blossom Fan," which contains two songs from The Peony Pavilion "Garden Stroll" (first singing "Good Sister," then singing "Zao Luo Pao"), had invited Pu Xiyuan to teach these two pieces. It is said that when this play was staged in Chongqing, Yunhe would go every night to sing, and Ding Cong would play the flute; this reminds me of an art appreciation meeting of the Literary and Art Association, where Ding Cong played Garden Stroll for me, and after finishing, bowed with a smile and went off the stage, that expression was very innocent and interesting.

### Night on the Jialing River – Jialing River Ballad No. 2

— Xiaofeng

At night, the sound of the Jialing River becomes more mournful. The gloomy sound of the waves echoes with a sob, like a resentful woman in the deep boudoir, sighing softly towards the starry night sky and the bright moon. Like a young woman missing her husband, weeping softly on a stormy night.

At night, the lights on both banks of the Jialing River are like scattered stars in the night sky, scattered on the mountain peaks and water banks. From the river bay, several fishing lights shimmer. The quietness of the night brings tranquility to the fishermen, reducing the fatigue of the whole day with a comfortable rest.

When the footprints of night have covered the Jialing River, the small town on the banks of the Jialing River begins to sink into the stillness of the air. The doors of the small shops begin to close. The night wind blows out the lights in the town, blowing the noisy human voices of the day towards the valleys of the mountains and the banks of the water, leaving only desolation and loneliness to this small town on the river bank.

In the shelter of the eaves, one or two beggars lie sprawled, with a pile of messy straw and a few pieces of torn cotton wool forming their resting place. Sometimes, they turn over, uttering a pleading delirium.

On the quiet roads, wild dogs run in packs. Sometimes, they bark at the distant lights, sometimes they bite and pounce on each other to compete for a dry bone or a piece of smelly sheepskin, and sometimes they happily run towards the desolate ancient tomb area, running towards the depths of the low forest.

The watchman, like a national spirit, carries a small paper lantern and strolls out from the deep alleys, knocking the short wooden stick on the bamboo clapper, reporting a not very accurate time as he walks from one end of the street to the other. A pair of broken shoes without heels patter...patter on the cobblestones, echoing the chirping of insects.

The night is deep, the sound of the Jialing River becomes more gloomy, the small town on the banks of the Jialing River becomes more desolate, the people have all gone to sleep, only a few drunken men returning home and some people strolling on the road are still pacing on this desolate street.

Beside the street, one or two hunched-over old people selling stir-fried rice candy and boiled water are slowly walking along the street. Sometimes, they also put down the large iron pot full of boiled water and the old bamboo basket containing bowls, utensils, and stir-fried rice candy, and sit on the cobblestones, burying their heads and vigorously fanning the charcoal fire under the pot. When a dark shadow appears on the road, he raises his voice and shouts "Stir-fried rice candy... boiled... water..." until the dark shadow has disappeared around the corner of the house, he disappointedly hangs his head, looks at the charcoal fire under the pot, and then picks up the water pot and the bamboo basket and walks to another place.

Sometimes, when I wake up in the middle of the night, the breeze is blowing through my window. In this desolate small town on the banks of the Jialing River, the sound of stir-fried rice candy and boiled water is still echoing, walking from one end of the street to the other, and slowly walking over from the distance again. The shrill cry is like the cold wind sweeping the withered leaves of late autumn, and also brushing past the gaunt treetops, desolate, miserable, like someone calling out and weeping in the desolate small town in the middle of the night.

The day is about to dawn, and travelers begin to appear on the road. Those selling boiled eggs and soybean milk and fried dough sticks also set up wooden stands on the side of the street, inviting travelers with friendly voices.

The Jialing River gradually awakens in the sunlight, and the small town on the banks of the Jialing River gradually becomes active and noisy. This noisy sound, this rushing water of the Jialing River, is slowly brewing, slowly creating, another mournful and tragic night for the Jialing.

### Spring Sacrifice

— Xiao Fu

The grey and ancient small town exposes the scars of artillery fire, like a paralyzed patient baring his body afflicted with hateful scabies; the phoenix's rebirth is ultimately a beautiful myth, no buildings were built on the ruins, but were covered by barren wormwood and muddy moss. The old and weak people, with sickly complexions and tattered clothes, gasp in the lingering fear of bayonets and the suffering of poverty. "Daybreak" is only a vague hope, gradually diminishing is a brief spring dream of restoring the old life.

Along the way, old women pointed at me behind my back, whispering, clearly talking about my return. Neighbors greeted me with surprise, calculating the years I had been away from home, causing pointless disputes; they asked about my wife, asked how many children I had, saying I was lucky, lamenting that my mother had already passed away, and her regret of not being able to hold her grandson. I thanked them for their concern, but I was not happy at all. What they were overflowing with was sympathy that didn't hit the mark. They had no idea how heavy a burden I was carrying on my shoulders, how long I had carried it, and that I still couldn't rest and catch my breath. I was immersed in memories, when I was so young, so full of life like a newborn calf; but chewing on the bitter juice of life, I gradually felt my own fatigue and old age. I almost saw their warm solicitude as greasy flattery. Answering their questions briefly, I hurried away.

When I saw the mottled garden wall and the dilapidated gate from afar, I was slightly attacked by a childhood memory: once a year, in the height of summer, the doors and windows would be painted brightly, as if to maintain the reputation of a family, while tirelessly embellishing its appearance; at this time, my younger siblings and I would often be happy to share a little light work, dipping broken brushes in tung oil and painting the bamboo bars of the oyster shell window sashes. But after these long years, they have been eroded and decayed by wind and frost, doesn't it just reflect the rise and fall of my family's fortunes, and the joys and sorrows of everyone's life under this roof. Even if one day I can redecorate this lintel, where can I find the lost joy of childhood?

My father's teeth were more gapped, his back more hunched, his emaciated appearance had changed so drastically, that there was a huge difference from the impression in my memory. Impressions are often static, children seem to be children forever, and the elderly also seem to be as old as they were in the past, making us almost dare not believe it when we reunite after a long absence: "Ah! You've aged a lot!" I have been played by the ruthlessness of time. Thirty years of a teacher's life, he has blurred his eyes with lesson papers, exhausted his mind, and worn through the sleeves of how many clothes at his desk!

"You're back, good, you're finally back!" He was relaxed and happy as if he had put down a heavy burden. He asked about my wife and children, inquiring about the safety of our journey. He told me that Uncle Yun had performed divination for our safety, saying there were risks on the way; Uncle Yun asked how to resolve this fated disaster, and the spirit pointed out three words: Be Sincere to Buddha. Father was not a follower of Han Changli, so he recited Amitabha Buddha dozens of times a day. Now that he heard that the ship we were on encountered wind and waves in the Yangtze River, so it was anchored near Madang for a whole day, he said with awareness and relief: "Yes, yes; you can't completely believe it, but you can't not believe it. Reciting Buddha doesn't hurt anything, a gentleman asks about disaster but not about fortune."

The next day was the clan's spring sacrifice; this time I planned to stay for only a few days after returning home, so I might as well take this opportunity to see the clansmen, saving myself the trouble of visiting each family. I happened to be catching up unintentionally.

The ancestral hall was in a remote place in the corner of the city, and had been in disrepair for years, so dilapidated that it could not keep out the wind and rain. The doors and windows had long been dismantled by the garrison and refugees to cook, leaving it open and empty, like an old man with missing teeth, grotesquely opening his haggard mouth. The courtyard was overgrown with weeds, and the old warden also had no intention of hoeing, covering it with rainwater, wetting people's clothes and shoes. Clansmen arrived one after another with umbrellas. I don't know the situation of the spring and autumn rain sacrifices during these years of war, but it was so desolate and lonely compared to before the war. It seems that most people came to make an appearance, to get a tasty meal in these months of not knowing the taste of meat. The clan chief, my great uncle, was still decently dressed, and rigidly took out his recent draft of poems for people to appreciate. One couplet in the poem used green against red sheep, which shows that he could still drink a cup of fine wine every day in the years of war and chaos, and his later years were relatively comfortable. Father and two or three uncles were dressed somewhat shabbily, and the rest could simply be said to be in tatters. One of my cousins was wearing a short, narrow long gown, full of grease and patches. I asked him what he had been doing lately, and he said with a blush and an apology: "It's nothing to talk about, nothing to talk about!" Someone told me behind my back that this cousin had mostly been living by selling clothes for the past few years. Thinking that he couldn't pick out a suitable and presentable piece of clothing for himself from the many clothes that passed through his hands, it can be seen how humble his industry and how bitter his days were. So few clansmen arrived, perhaps some were running around in foreign lands to find clothes and food; some who stayed at home were also ashamed of their poverty, and even the temptation of a meal of wine and food could not dispel his self-esteem that was timid to see people, and he would rather hide in his house chewing vegetable roots and thin porridge?

The sacrificial ceremony began. The officiant chanted three offerings of wine and incense according to custom, their voices were so weak and mournful. The people kneeling and worshiping in turn by generation, hastily and quickly kowtowed, everyone was without a trace of piety and solemnity. Human affection is as thin as paper, even descendants towards their ancestors are still like this; generally, only when days are warm and well-fed can people think of the difficulties of their predecessors in starting a business, and be grateful and pious to them; now, facing these ten-odd plaques that indicate "Jieyuan," "Mingjing," and "Bagong," mottled and dusty, covered with spider webs, the descendants' little filial piety for remembering their ancestors has long vanished.

The dishes were so simple, and the wine was so weak; but everyone praised the clan chief for handling affairs so seriously; because the ancestral hall's fields were pitifully small, in today's world of rice like pearls and firewood like cassia, it almost cost money to set up three tables of wine and food. During the banquet, someone talked about what family was holding a funeral, and an ordinary coffin cost tens of millions of new tickets, saying that if the elderly happened to die in this year, it was simply making things difficult for their children and daughters-in-law. Although this was a cynical joke, the expressions of agreement in the nods of many people almost revealed their feelings of worry for their aging parents, and regretted missing the happiness of being an unfilial mourner in the peaceful years of the past.

These many years of war and struggle have accelerated the decline of this class represented by my clan. This pathetic and laughable quasi-gentry class, used to study painting for a few years, recognize a few words and write literary compositions, teach in private schools, and be idle guests in government offices. Once in an era of great turmoil, if they can't climb up to become small politicians who stir up trouble and fish in troubled waters, they will fall into the trap of poverty, floating and sinking in the storms like a piece of broken ship plank. They can't carry on their shoulders, they can't lift with their hands, they are deeply poisoned by a long gown, and they stubbornly cling to not taking off this long gown, as if a lotus gentleman on the verge of bankruptcy lacks the determination and courage to quit his opium addiction to the death.

Those who cannot carry the burden of the times will inevitably be thrown aside by ruthless fate, collapsing and rolling in the ditches, weakly looking at the dust raised by the gradually receding rows. I suddenly became alarmed, whether I, who grew up in this class, had resolutely shed that spiritual long gown, escaped from this class, and had the strength to carry on this burden of duty and continue walking?

### An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng13

"Your grandpa is just teasing you."

"Really, that's how he talks to everyone. If you're free, chat with him a bit, you'll definitely hear it."

"You're only thirteen years old this year, did you start practicing martial arts as soon as you hit the ground?" Feeling amused, I couldn't help but laugh.

"Who says I didn't?" This kid definitely has a genuine Northeastern accent, starting every sentence with a question.

"Sigh…? An outsider would never believe that."

"Before, my dad had a fight with someone and had an arm broken; Mom went to get revenge, but she got beaten too. Out of spite, my grandpa practiced some kind of leg technique that could break people's chi. Grandpa is my own grandpa's martial brother. Grandpa said my mom was too old to practice. That's a unique skill, if you're over fifteen, you definitely can't learn it. My mom was eighteen, and she got married, so it wasn't possible." He didn't continue, looking like his mind had already wandered off to something else.

"And then?" I prompted him.

"And then… and then…" Maybe he was considering how to continue.

"And then you came along, didn't you?" I connected the story for him.

"That's right…" As if he had overcome a difficult obstacle, "That's right… but I wasn't even born yet, you know?"

"I understand." I told him very seriously.

"Grandpa knew about this, and said 'Alright, this time we can practice.' From that day on, we started practicing – but not for Mom to practice, for me to practice, Grandpa said…" He turned his head, his eyes darting around, wanting to see if I really understood what he was saying.

This time I really understood. He was probably practicing so-called "prenatal education." I was willing to listen to this legend.

"Grandpa had people draw a lot of Buddha images, one image for each kung fu stance, together, a set of 'Bodhidharma Practice Chart.'" Grandpa mimed a stance, and had someone draw a picture based on that stance, once it was drawn, he hung it all over a room, and had Mom look at it, she had to look at it several times a day. Just look, don't move. He also taught Mom to practice breathing exercises; before dawn, she had to sit in the courtyard and practice breathing exercises. She also had to take medicine, called 'Replenishing Congenital' pills."

"Once the stances were familiar, Grandpa practiced for Mom to watch, telling Mom to think about practicing, but not to move. After thinking about it, she would stroll in the courtyard, practicing three or four times a day, in less than a month, Mom knew everything, and Grandpa would ask Mom questions. If Mom couldn't answer, Grandpa would mime for Mom to watch. Grandpa said they were all boxing manuals, with a hundred ways to…."

"In the days leading up to 'giving birth,' Mom started worrying, 'afraid of having a girl,' Mom kept muttering. Grandpa said he actually liked girls, if it was a girl, Grandpa would teach her Iron Palm, seventy-two stances of Skirt-Hidden Legs, Congenital One…" He paused. "Definitely get revenge."

Acting

### To a Friend

— Zhongyuan

I am wearing a pure white silk robe, long and trailing on the ground. The ground is covered with white blossoms. A shimmering light shoots up, onto my chest, my shoulders, my head. Ah! On my chest, I wear a small golden sun. On my shoulders, I drape a Taoist robe trimmed with gold. On my head, I wear a large hat inlaid with golden stars. I am solemn, my eyes looking at my nose. I seem to be in deep thought, as if silently praying. Step by step, I walk very slowly, to a high platform. At the very center of the platform hangs a huge, unparalleled sun. On the platform, there is a golden incense burner. Blazing flames leap from the incense burner, and the flames exhale a dense fragrance. I stand upright in solemn silence, pressing my palms together. Enveloped in the swirling flames and fragrance, I seem to have arrived before God. Toward the blazing flames and the high-hanging sun, I reverently bow down, bow down, bow down again – at this moment, the audience below sings out, "Bravo! Bravo!"

The name of the play was "The Lost Star." It was performed at a Christmas celebration in our girls' school more than ten years ago. In that play, I played a young doctor, more or less the main character, I think? I don't remember clearly. But I remember that a few days after the play, an elder wrote me a letter containing this sentence:

"You acted very well in the play. Your play is not over. I hope you will always continue to perform with such reverence and earnestness!"

What does this mean?

At that time, I was too young to understand what this meant. But later, I suddenly understood. I don't need to tell you how I came to understand it. But I want to tell you that it is because I understood this sentence that I have been able to remain in this suffering world to this day, more than ten years later.

Now I want to say something else to you.

The day before yesterday, on such a hot and humid afternoon, your letter suddenly arrived. Every time I see your letter, I am always happy, always excited, always as if I see a tall figure, wearing a pure white silk robe, draped with a Taoist robe trimmed with gold, wearing a large hat with golden stars, standing before a platform wreathed in incense, reverently bowing down, bowing down, bowing down again!...

However, this time, after reading your letter, my hand suddenly trembled.

I am not surprised that you said, "I really want to leave Shanghai," nor am I surprised that you said, "My heart is even more uneasy than during wartime." But I am surprised by this sentence you said: "I am cynical about everyone and everything!"...

"Cynical!"...

Ah! More than surprised, more than alarmed! More than worried!...

Ah, my friend, are you joking with me?...

Not your elder, not your confidant, just a loyal reader of yours, a friend whom you have never met, today wishes to solemnly return this precious sentence to you:

"You acted very well in the play. Your play is not over. May you always continue to perform with such reverence and earnestness!"

### Ramblings by a Dim Lamp

— Shaofu

The Reuters dispatch from Paris on the 19th mentioned that two female reporters from China were very active at the Peace Conference, one being Ding Qinglu and the other Xu Zongbai, both of which are actually mistranslations. Liao Qinglu is a mistake for Lu Jingqing, and Xu Zongbai is a mistake for Xu Zhongpei.

Lu Jingqing, pen name Xiao Lu, is the wife of the late Councilor Yu Lixi and is one of the most prominent female writers in China, on par with Xie Bingxin, Huang Luyin, and Chen Xuezhao.

Both Lu and Xu are of short stature, weighing less than a hundred pounds, which is why they likely attracted special attention at the Peace Conference.

September 1st is Journalist's Day, but newspapers are not suspending publication for a day because of it, so doing our line of work is more difficult than any other. Three hundred and sixty-five days a year, the more it is some kind of commemorative holiday, the more tense and busy we are. Contrasting this with the ease and leisure of others, we feel even worse.

Not that I'm feeling sorry for myself, but that so-called "uncrowned king" hat is both laughable and tearful.

A visitor from Chengdu says that when Sichuan University, Chongqing University, and other schools in Chengdu held entrance exams, some people raised millions of dollars and colluded with the workers of the examination committee to steal the exam questions, forming a "lecture committee" to peddle them to the test-takers, each question priced at two thousand five hundred yuan.

These business acumen, professors or examination committee members did not think of. No wonder some merchants would scold scholars as after all they are scholars, even if the God of Wealth comes, they would not know how to open the door!

The autumn wind has risen, and the signs of autumn are gradually appearing. Looking back on the rampage of cholera this summer, we can count ourselves lucky that not many people died. May those who have survived the jaws of death take extra care at this time, because at this juncture, all the grievances, large and small, lurking within the body are waiting to settle accounts with you.

### A Difference of One Word

— Erjie

The United States and the Soviet Union have vastly different interpretations of the Yalta Agreement. In the past, when the Japanese cabinet was amending the constitution, Shidehara insisted that it was not necessary to amend it, but only to add a new interpretation. The same words can have marvelous effects when interpreted differently, which is why Confucius was extremely careful in his praise and criticism in the Spring and Autumn Annals, because a slight carelessness could not only fail to criticize him properly, but also risk being used as a shield.

We often see the sentence "all property will be confiscated except for the necessary living expenses of the family" attached to reports of the sentencing of traitors after conviction. This word "酌" [zhuó, "discretionary"] is endlessly wonderful. "酌" means considering the circumstances, relying entirely on human sentiment, with no rigid regulations. Does the so-called necessary living expenses of the family only cover the cost of plain clothes and simple tea, or does it also require expenses for dancing and automobiles in addition to large dishes and western-style houses? If the law has no explicit provisions, everyone can manipulate it.

Speaking of examples, since Li Ze was sentenced, the authorities seem to have taken a lenient attitude and have not taken any action or confiscated Li Ze's property, presumably based on the "酌" in "酌留" [zhuóliú, "discretionary reservation"]. And the New New Company is probably saying that Li Ze's property is not enough for his family's necessary living expenses, so "still paying more than three million yuan per month" can also be said to be handled with discretion. Judging from this case, one can infer the rest, but they can shamelessly say that it is "handled according to law," isn't it wonderful!

The main text of the court's judgment should be a rigid regulation, which is unnecessary to say. When we sentence criminals to imprisonment, we do not say that we will "酌判" [zhuó pàn, "discretionarily sentence"] them to several years, but we must state the number of years and months. However, when dealing with the property of traitors, we insist on using the word "酌" [zhuó, "discretion"], is it because we do not want to lose the "principle of loyalty and forgiveness"? We cannot but feel regret about this!

The Dagong Bao reported on the 19th that the Ministry of Justice and Administration will soon have regulations on the matter of discretionary retention of family living expenses. We hope that this "soon" will not be delayed too long, and what will happen to these traitorous masters who have already been granted "discretionary retention" after the regulations are made in the future? Will they still be treated with "leniency"? The writer can only sell this out. "Dear readers, let's see the next chapter for the analysis."

In addition, people in Guangxi are going to the mountains in groups to dig up wild arrowhead, wild, fern roots, and Guanzhong flour to fill their stomachs. These must also be delicious delicacies. Some people in Hubei are eating duckweed and swallowing chaff, which are naturally also two famous delicacies. These are all the latest foods that can be enjoyed by the Shanghai oldies.

People of Shanghai, do you know what those foods taste like?

### Do a Good Deed Every Day

— Zhongbiao

Teacher: Everyone should do a good deed every day. Have you done anything to help or save people every day?

Student A: Seeing the decline of industry, yesterday I smashed ten American glass cups in my uncle's house to protest for national products.

Student B: Teacher, I originally didn't plan to study, but then I thought about it. If we students don't study, won't the teacher have no food to eat? Therefore, I had a great compassionate heart and came here every day to hold the place for a few hours, just to help you, teacher!

### What is Life?

— Hu Xiuru

(The following is a conversation between a fifteen-year-old middle school student and his teacher)

Student: Teacher, what is life?

Teacher: ... For a painter, life is drawing; for a musician, life is composing; for a doctor, life is treating illnesses; for a miser, life is making money; for a warmongering revolutionary, life is shedding blood...

Student: Teacher, then your life should be teaching!

Teacher: Yes, life has different interpretations in different eyes. Because there are differences, people ask which kind of life is happy. People like happiness and avoid worries, but in fact, all kinds of worries are revolving around you.

Student: I want to know what kind of life is happy.

Teacher: A happy life is made of truth, goodness, and beauty. Truth is the opposite of falsehood, goodness is the opposite of evil, beauty is the opposite of ugliness. If you don't deceive people, don't lie, and don't say that it was Ah Wei who broke the vase in your daily life, then you have truth. If you can say comforting words, such as encouraging a classmate who is held back, then you have goodness. Furthermore, if you don't do excessive things, such as when you take the tram; you sit properly in a space that fits your size and don't lean on two seats, if you can make people feel comfortable looking at you, then you have beauty.

Student: I understand a little.

### Character Sketch From "Platoon Leader" to Chairman - A Biography of General Wan Yaohuang

— Youfu

The current Chairman of Hubei Province is General Wan Yaohuang, the former Education Director of the Military Academy. When he was once the Education Director of the Army University, those naughty students gave this old lieutenant general in his fifties a nickname - "Platoon Leader Wan."

As the name implies, the duties of a platoon leader, as explicitly stated in Article 51 of Section 21 of the Infantry Manual, are: "Under the command of the company commander, the platoon leader uses all means to educate the soldiers under his command to perform various duties during peacetime. During wartime, he commands his platoon to conduct combat according to the company commander's orders or intentions."

In other words, whether in peacetime or wartime, the platoon leader always lives with the soldiers, day and night, sharing life and death. In terms of training, the platoon leader is the officer closest to the soldiers. The soldiers' actions, even eating, dressing, walking, etc., all require the platoon leader to teach them at all times and in all places. Because there are uniform regulations for soldiers' eating, dressing, and walking, and even urination and defecation have specific locations and times (urination and defecation are not allowed during drills and classes), the platoon leader specifically supervises the soldiers' small movements and corrects them regardless of leisure or time, so that they become a typical and healthy soldier.

Lieutenant General Education Director, Platoon Leader Style

When General Wan Yaohuang was the Education Director of the Army University, he adopted the style of a "platoon leader." He once said: "The more minor the matter, the more difficult it is to handle well. Soldiers must be vigilant and meticulous at all times, so pay special attention to small things!" He treated all the students of the Army University equally, whether they were old men in their fifties or division and army commanders, major generals and lieutenant generals who had commanded thousands of troops. As long as there was a problem, he would correct it immediately if he saw it. Once, the bugle for class sounded, and a student hurriedly came out of the toilet, forgetting to button one of his pants buttons. Just as "Platoon Leader Wan" saw it, he immediately reprimanded him, insisting that the student button it before he was allowed to leave.

Afterwards, that student (because he was a division commander by origin) publicized to other students that the education director was really inexplicable, treating us like three-year-old children, even managing our buttoning of buttons. This is really not the demeanor of a general, and is similar to the appearance of a platoon leader! We shouldn't call him the Education Director in the future, we should call him "Platoon Leader Wan."

In the summer of the 30th year, when General Wan Yaohuang was transferred to the Military Academy, the students of the Army University gave him a temporary evaluation: It is really appropriate for Platoon Leader Wan to be transferred to the Military Academy as Education Director. Because the students of the Military Academy will first serve as platoon leaders after graduation.

Various Problems are Headache-Inducing

After General Wan was transferred to the Military Academy as Education Director, he still couldn't get rid of the style of a platoon leader. During inspections, he would walk in front of the students and violently slap their shoulders, and then ask them: "Who is your Education Director?" "Who is your Captain?" "How wide are your shoulders?" "How many centimeters is your index finger?" "How long is your vertical line of sight from head to toe?" "How far is it from your classroom to your dormitory?" "How many windows are there in your classroom?" This series of extremely small questions made the students dizzy. If the student couldn't answer, he immediately ordered the officers to give this student special training.

At the memorial week, he publicly reported: "Yesterday I met several officers in a certain place, and they didn't salute me. I will never allow it next time."

Due to these facts, the young students also unanimously and boldly shouted "Platoon Leader." One day, General Wan came to the drill ground, and a group of students were happily saying: "The Platoon Leader is here." Unexpectedly, he heard it, and General Wan asked the students, "Who is the Platoon Leader?" "Which Platoon Leader is here!" The students were silent and dared not speak. Later, General Wan repeatedly guaranteed that there would be no punishment for speaking out, and then one student plucked up the courage to say "The Platoon Leader is the Education Director." The students around him burst into laughter. General Wan himself couldn't help but laugh.

Now, Platoon Leader Wan has been transferred to Chairman of Hubei. This may be due to the celebration of his five years of "Platoon Leader" education at the Military Academy!

### Small Matters

— Xiaoshi

During the enemy-puppet era, Avenue Joffre was renamed Taishan Road. At the same time, the concessions were recovered, and all police stations were uniformly renamed police bureaus. Consequently, the original Songshan Road Police Station was renamed Taishan Road Police Sub-Bureau. Unexpectedly, after the victory, the authorities renamed Taishan Road to Linsen Middle Road. Since the change of the road name to the present, it has been nearly a year, but the Linsen Middle Road Police Sub-Bureau in front still hangs the signboard of Taishan Road Sub-Bureau. This measure is really puzzling. According to the usual practice, the spirit of reform of the police authorities is ahead of the people and other administrative organs, but now that the signboard, which has been long gone in name, is still hanging at the gate of the bureau, it is quite worthy of discussion, I wonder if the authorities have noticed it?

The day before yesterday, the writer went to Hongkou twice for business and witnessed that many high-rise buildings have now been occupied by Chinese military and political organs or manufacturers run by officials and civilians. (Seen from the signs outside.) However, those houses were forcibly occupied by the enemy during the enemy-puppet era and were privately set up as warehouses or trading houses. Therefore, those huge signboards, such as Mitsubishi Corporation ×× Warehouse, Fukushima Corporation Shanghai Branch...etc. are still everywhere to be seen. In fact, since the current people in the house are no longer enemy-puppets, those signboards should have been removed long ago. Is it possible that they have spent great efforts to take back the houses, but now they don't even have the power to remove a signboard? Bauer, Director of the U.S. Economic Stabilization Bureau, loves dogs as friends.

### Gambling on Obscure Fields and Speculation

— Yang Zhifu

In commercial transactions, there are so-called "gambling on obscure fields" and "speculation" tricks. In other words, merchants will find opportunities to scoop up a batch of goods, stockpile them for a certain period of time, and then sell them at a high price. Or they see that the market is lacking a certain kind of goods—and this kind of goods is exactly what most people urgently need—targeting the psychology of buyers and finding opportunities to make a fortune. However, unexpectedly, the same fashionable terms have actually appeared in the minds of young students. They also understand this set, and will make a fuss about this set, but only the objects and means they take are different. Merchants are engaged in buying and selling, but students are dealing with exams. That is, when students apply to a school, they will not ask about their own interests, but only choose departments with few people to apply for. Because they believe that as long as there are few people, it is easier to take the exam, and increase their "probability" of being "admitted."

I am not a merchant, and I have never engaged in buying and selling, so I have no way of knowing how merchants "gamble on obscure fields" or how they "speculate." However, I have personally heard the conversations of students. I have also personally seen a small number of students go to the schools holding the entrance exams on the last day of registration to inquire about the number of the registration forms, check how many people have registered for a certain department, and which department certain people have registered for, changing their plans according to the situation, and making the decision to register or not.

Of course, accurate speculation will allow merchants to scoop up a large amount of "ill-gotten gains," increasing their level of extravagance, and living a better life. For students, it will occasionally satisfy their desires" and be admitted by luck. But sometimes the luck is not good, and the "speculation" is empty. Not only will the merchants be ruined, but they will also be labeled as "profiteers," and students will also develop their laziness and ultimately end up "failing the exam."

"Luck only leads to failure." We should not forget this sentence. At the same time, we should not play tricks in our careers; we should not play tricks in exams either. We should put more effort into our own studies, and at least when applying to a school, we should consider our own interests and choose our departments.

Finally, I must declare that I am a student, and I am also a student who is hoping to be "admitted." The purpose of writing this article is to encourage myself not to make the "speculation" for the sake of the goal!
