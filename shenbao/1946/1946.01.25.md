### The Constitutional Draft Issue Can Be Resolved Smoothly; Political and Military Matters Still Require Negotiation; Comprehensive Group Holds Second Meeting Today

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 24th] Yesterday, the deliberations within the various groups of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC) took a temporary turn for the worse. The Communist Party (CCP) in the Military Group proposed a joint military commission; the CCP in the National Assembly Group insisted on re-elections for the old representatives; and the Democratic League also abandoned its veto proposal, endorsing the CCP's re-election proposal. Only the Program Group had similar views, reaching agreements on restoration, disaster relief, education, and culture. This situation only improved after the first meeting of the Comprehensive Sub-committee was held at 4:00 PM. The National Assembly Group proceeded with the allocation of newly added representatives; the Military Group still lacked progress; and the other three groups remained unchanged. Today, the Military and Constitutional Draft groups will continue their discussions, and the Comprehensive Sub-committee will hold its fourth meeting at 4:00 PM. Furthermore, after hosting a banquet for the delegates last night, Chairman Chiang had a discussion with Zhou Enlai, Zhang Junmai, Zeng Qi, and others. The CCP and the Democratic League also held separate meetings until late at night, the contents of which are unknown, but there is still no news as to when the general assembly can be convened. Public opinion believes that the success or failure of the conference hinges on the achievements of the Comprehensive Sub-committee and the Military Trio Group.

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 24th] The Military Group of the Political Consultative Conference held its fourth meeting today, continuing the discussions and making some progress compared to yesterday. However, during the third meeting yesterday, the discussion on the restructuring of military authorities was lengthy and quite contentious. Some members believed that military institutions must be thoroughly reorganized to accommodate people from all sides in order to guarantee the implementation of nationalization of the military. Points on which agreement could not be reached were temporarily set aside. Moreover, the most difficult problem originally in the PCC, the validity of the old National Assembly representatives, is no longer an issue in the Comprehensive Sub-committee. Negotiations on the constitutional draft can also be resolved smoothly. The current focus is on the Political and Military Groups, and only after the two groups reach a consensus can the Program Group achieve a satisfactory resolution. This morning, the Political, Military, and Program groups held meetings simultaneously. This afternoon, the Constitutional Draft Group will hold a general assembly, which will be the final meeting before adjournment. However, it is difficult to say for certain whether the discussions can be concluded in three days.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 24th] The Political Consultative Conference's sub-committees on the constitutional draft, government organization, and administrative programs held meetings in the morning and afternoon of the 24th. Further progress was made in reaching agreements on various issues. The sub-committees will continue negotiations tomorrow and convene the second meeting of the Comprehensive Committee without holding a general assembly.

[United Press, Chongqing, 24th] U.S. Special Envoy General Marshall held another meeting with Chairman Chiang this morning. It is expected that General Marshall will soon meet with the Military Group Committee to study the reorganization and nationalization of the Chinese army.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 24th] Special Envoy Marshall received Chairman Zhang Qun at his residence at 10:00 AM this morning.

### Ceasefire in Tai'an and Datong; Negotiations Underway in Jining and Chifeng

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th, Urgent Telegram] Military News: A ceasefire has been confirmed in Tai'an. Colonel Lake of the Military Mediation Department's Executive Group, along with Geng Xuwu, a staff officer of the Military Affairs Department, and Chen Shuliang, a CCP representative, jointly presented a ceasefire order from the government and the Communist army. The National Army has fully accepted it. Although the Communist army has agreed to the order to withdraw from Tai'an Station, they have not yet done so. Colonel Lake and others are still in Jinan, awaiting news of the Communist army's withdrawal from Tai'an. Whether the mediation work can proceed smoothly and whether the Jinpu Railway can be quickly repaired and open to traffic next month will depend on the Tai'an incident as a touchstone.

[Our Newspaper Report] London, 24th, Broadcast: A British Broadcasting Corporation correspondent who went to Suiyuan Province to inspect the implementation of the ceasefire order the day before yesterday felt optimistic about the future. The correspondent spoke with the commander of the Communist army, who said that the Chinese civil war has been going on for 35 years and that the Communist Party is eager to end this war as soon as possible.

(4) Negotiations in Jining are still ongoing. The Communist Party claims to have occupied the area before the ceasefire order took effect, while the Nationalist army claims to have abandoned it after being occupied. (5) Negotiations are also underway in Chifeng. After the Soviet army withdrew from the area, the security team maintained order. The Soviet army's withdrawal from Chifeng was expected to be completed yesterday. There was no movement of Soviet troops in Duolun. The Fifth Mobile Investigation Team, based in Zhangjiakou, needs to travel by horse for 20 days to reach Duolun. According to Feren, a photographer with the United Press who is accompanying the team, when the Soviet army entered Duolun, they did not allow the Communist army to enter, but Chinese civilians could enter and exit freely.

The vice ministers of each ministry who remained in Nanjing reported to Deputy Premier Weng on the progress of their current work today. It is reported that Minister Yu will remain in Nanjing to handle important official matters and plans to leave in a few days. Whether he needs to go to North China again will depend on the report of Vice Minister Ling, who has already gone north. Deputy Premier Weng will not leave Nanjing in the short term because the central work of the Executive Yuan, such as adjusting finance, improving coal resources, restoring transportation, and revitalizing industry in the recovered areas, requires close guidance and supervision. The housing for the various ministries of the Executive Yuan has been largely found, but it is not enough. The three newly established ministries of food, agriculture and forestry, and social affairs after the war are still trying to find housing.

### Command Post Established in Shenyang; Division Commander Liu Dechuan Appointed Garrison Commander; Defense of Jinxi Area Taken Over by Our Army

[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 23rd] The development of the situation in the Northeast has reached an important stage in the coming week. The date for the Soviet army to withdraw from the Northeast is the first of next month, and so far there has been no proposal from the National Government to request the Soviet army to postpone its withdrawal. According to news obtained here, the Soviet army has stated that the current fuel shortage in the Northeast has greatly affected its plan to use trains to transport troops. Therefore, the Soviet army in Shenyang and other places has not yet taken over defense. The Soviet side previously notified our authorities in Changchun that the Soviet army would withdraw from the Chengde, Chifeng, and Zhangjiakou lines on the 20th of this month, but as of now, the Soviet army in the area does not seem to have received withdrawal orders. The Nationalist army in Rehe has received notice from the Soviet army not to cross the Jianchang line, and the Nationalist army in the province has prepared to move in after the Soviet army withdraws. As for the handover of defense in Changchun, due to Madam Chiang's visit to Changchun, the Soviet army is still responsible for security. Xiong Shihui is currently staying in Jinzhou and will go to inspect after the Nationalist army formally takes over Shenyang.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 23rd] The Northeast Security Commander's Office has established a Shenyang Command Post to facilitate the command of the troops receiving Shenyang. Deputy Commander Peng Yun-sheng has been appointed as the director. The Commander's Office has also appointed Liu Dechuan, the division commander of a certain division stationed in Shenyang, as the Shenyang Garrison Commander. The Shenyang Command Post and the Garrison Commander were formally established today. Director Peng told reporters that the Soviet side has handed over the defense of the Jinxi area to our troops.

[Reuters, Chongqing, 24th] Vice Minister Liu Cuo stated yesterday that the Soviet army in the Northeast was originally scheduled to withdraw on February 3, but due to transportation difficulties, it may be extended by a few days, but it will not be long, so there is no need for a formal postponement. The government spokesman yesterday listed the cities in the Northeast where Chinese administrative agencies have been established or are under their jurisdiction, including Changchun, Shenyang, Harbin, and Jinzhou.

### Situation in Rehe Becomes Delicate; Good Order in Chaoyang and Zhangwu Cities

[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 23rd] The current situation in Rehe is extremely delicate. Internally, the province is also an area where the ceasefire order is effective. Diplomatically, China and the Soviet Union have agreed on the date for the Soviet army to withdraw and for the Nationalist army to take over defense in Changchun. However, there is a possibility that the Nationalist army will be obstructed by the Communist army when it goes to take over defense. The development of the situation there seems worthy of attention.

[Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 24th] Chaoyang Report: Since the Nationalist army moved in, the military and civilians have lived in harmony, and the order in the city is good. Stores have reopened one after another, and the citizens are preparing to comfort the Nationalist army.

[Reuters, London, 24th] At today's meeting of the United Nations General Assembly, the 47 countries present unanimously agreed to organize a commission to "internationalize" the secrets of atomic energy.

Bernes, who will return to Washington tomorrow, gave a farewell speech at today's meeting on the resolution on atomic energy, calling for international cooperation to maintain peace. At the same time, the Security Council is expected to hold its first public meeting this afternoon, so it is generally believed that today is one of the most important days since the birth of the United Nations. Today's gathering was the first plenary session since last Saturday. At the beginning, the representative of Ecuador and member of the Political and Security Committee, Lai Du, gave a brief speech, recalling the intention of establishing the Atomic Energy Commission, saying that the commission will inquire into all aspects of this issue, submit reports and recommendations to the Security Council, and exchange basic scientific information on atomic weapons among countries for peaceful purposes, ensure control over atomic energy, eliminate the use of atomic weapons for national armaments, and provide effective guarantees through inspection methods. Bernes took the stage and spoke in front of the microphone, warning that the arms race would be extremely dangerous in the atomic age if not controlled. The representatives warmly applauded and leaned forward to listen quietly. Vyshinsky followed Bernes to the stage for the first time and gave a brief speech in Russian. The whole audience cheered, and the representatives clearly felt that Vyshinsky expressed satisfaction with the resolution of the Atomic Energy Commission, which was very helpful in the debate. After representatives from Poland, Philippines, France, Brazil, and other countries spoke successively, the resolution to establish the Atomic Energy Commission was voted on by a show of hands. After a short pause, the President of the General Assembly, Spaak, announced in French that it had been unanimously passed, and the audience applauded continuously. The General Assembly then unanimously adopted the report of the Administrative and Budgetary Committee on the appointment of the Secretary-General and adjourned the meeting.

[Reuters, London, 24th] The Political and Security Committee unanimously approved its first report to the United Nations General Assembly last night, proposing that the General Assembly pass a resolution to establish a commission to deal with various issues arising from the discovery of atomic energy and related matters.

He said briefly: "I am extremely honored to be elected this time, but the responsibility is even greater. All representatives understand the birth of this council and its responsibilities, which are closely related to the true security and future of the world. This task is not easy, and we must continue to work hard in the future. I am determined to do my best in my capacity as chairman to promote the goals of this council, and I believe that all of you will do your best to achieve this goal. I am grateful for your election."

[United Press, London, 23rd] The American Federation of Labor, which has more than six million members in the United States and Canada, wrote to United Nations Secretary-General Huashi today, stating that if the World Federation of Trade Unions is allowed to participate in the Economic and Social Council, then the American Federation of Labor should also enjoy the same treatment. Walter, the international representative of the American trade union group, arrived in London last week. It is said that the World Federation of Trade Unions' request to participate in the United Nations is tantamount to a scattered group hoping to obtain a status equal to that of an independent country. It is reported that the World Federation of Trade Unions has temporarily withdrawn its request, but will still file its request with the Secretariat of the United Nations.

### US Representative Suggests Amending Trusteeship System So that Indigenous Peoples of Colonies Can Enjoy the Benefits of the Charter Koo Vi-kyuin Expresses Agreement

[United Press, London, 24th] According to Dulles, a representative of the US delegation to the United Nations, the United States will suggest to the United Nations that the draft resolution on trusteeship be amended so that colonial countries allow their governed people to enjoy the benefits of the United Nations Charter in order to realize the "legitimate aspirations of non-self-governing peoples." A copy of the amendment has been sent to members of the committee. The proposal advocates that colonial countries should enable all indigenous peoples to generally enjoy the benefits of the United Nations Charter, rather than just the peoples of mandated territories. Comparing these two major categories of non-self-governing peoples, the residents of mandated territories total 13 million people, while the colonial peoples total more than 300 million. It is alleged that most of the non-trusteeship areas are in a state of extreme turmoil and unrest, and it would be a mistake to only think of the peoples of trusteeship territories and ignore the colonial peoples.

[Our Newspaper] London, 25th broadcast: The Trusteeship Committee held a meeting last night, where the US representative suggested amending the Trusteeship System, and the Chinese representative Dr. Koo Vi-kyuin agreed. Dr. Koo said that all the world's nations obtaining autonomous governments is one of the conditions for lasting peace, and we are well aware of the current level of unrest among the governed peoples.

### French Mandated Territories in Africa Willing to Transfer to Trusteeship Only After Concluding Agreements with the Two Territories

[United Press, London, 23rd] The former German territories of Togo and Cameroon in Africa were mandated to France by the League of Nations after World War I. Today, the French representative Ponsot announced in the United Nations General Assembly's Trusteeship Committee that France is willing to respect the text and spirit of the San Francisco United Nations Charter. After concluding agreements with Togo and Cameroon, the two territories will be transferred to the administration of the United Nations. However, due to the unstable political situation in France, no further announcements can be made. After Mr. Ponsot finished speaking, the representatives of various countries applauded. However, the US representative declared to the Trusteeship Committee that an agreement must be concluded with the mandated territory before the Trusteeship Council is established, causing the Council to be unable to be organized and established in the first phase of the General Assembly. The committee should announce its regret. The US representative hinted that the Trusteeship Council should be formed during the second phase of the meeting, which will be convened in the United States later.

[United Press, London, 24th] Prime Minister Attlee declared in the House of Commons today that the British government has notified China, the Soviet Union, the United States, and other countries about the draft on the transfer of African mandated territories by the United Kingdom to the United Nations. In addition, the King of Outer Jordan will come to London to discuss the issue of the country's independence.

### Representatives of the Five Powers Discuss Candidates for Secretary-General Unable to Reach a Decision Security Council to Continue Meeting Today

[United Press, London, 24th] The United Nations Security Council is scheduled to hold a public meeting tomorrow afternoon to discuss how to deal with the situations in Iran, Greece, and Indonesia.

[United Press, London, 24th] The representatives of the five permanent members of the Security Council, namely US Secretary of State Bernes, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky, British Foreign Secretary Bevin, French Representative Peng Gu, and Chinese Ambassador to the United Kingdom Koo Vi-kyuin, held an informal meeting yesterday to discuss the candidates for Secretary-General, but were still unable to reach a decision. The Soviet Union insists that since the headquarters of the United Nations are located in the Americas, the post of Secretary-General should belong to an Eastern European country, which is the reason for the difficulty in selecting a candidate.

[Reuters, London, 24th] The number of candidates for the post of Secretary-General has been reduced to two: one is the Canadian Ambassador to the United States, Pearson, who has the support of Britain and the United States, and the other is the Norwegian Foreign Minister, Lie, who has the support of the Soviet Union.

### Zhang Pengchun's Speech on the Opening Day of the Social and Economic Council Cites Mencius' Famous Quote The Whole Audience Applauds

[Central News Agency, London, 23rd Dispatch] At the opening ceremony of the Economic and Social Council tonight, our representative Zhang Pengchun delivered a speech, mentioning two reasons why China is satisfied with the establishment of this important council: (1) The United Nations, as a living organization, must win and cultivate new confidence from the people in all corners of the world. I hope that this new confidence can be promoted through various constructive cooperative matters initiated by the Economic and Social Council. (2) People of all countries in the world want to obtain true mutual understanding and rely on each other's cooperation to solve some common problems. Appropriate viewpoints and careful review can help us promote various efforts to improve welfare. The ancient sage Mencius said, "Those who subdue others by force do not win their hearts; those who subdue others by virtue win their hearts with joy and sincerity." Zhang cited Mencius' famous quote in Chinese, which won applause from the whole audience. Zhang then said that Mencius' so-called "subduing people with virtue" is the responsibility of this council. If it can fulfill this responsibility, the whole world will "rejoice and sincerely submit."

### Gouin Elected President of France Starts Forming New Cabinet Encourages All Parties to Unite and Overcome Difficulties Together De Gaulle Expresses No Intention to Go Abroad

[Our Newspaper] According to London, 24th broadcast: The French Constituent Assembly elected its successor president last night, and Socialist Party leader Gouin was elected with 497 votes. Gouin immediately announced that he hoped to form a new cabinet tomorrow, including several ministers and several deputy ministers. According to his remarks to reporters, the new French government has an unprecedented responsibility. I did not seek the post of president this time, and I accepted the new post because of a sense of responsibility. If necessary, I am prepared to sacrifice my life for the country. I deeply hope that all party members will unite and overcome the current difficult period.

[United Press, Paris, 23rd] The Socialist Party leader, 61-year-old lawyer Gouin, has been elected as the interim prime minister to succeed the popular Comnole. According to the current situation, it can be predicted that his task will not be easy to complete. According to official sources, De Gaulle resigned in anger because the three major French parties failed to abandon their private opinions during the national construction period. The Communist Party initially nominated Thorez as a candidate, but because the People's Republican Movement opposed it, it changed to nominating Gouin in a non-partisan action. After Gouin takes office, the Communist and Socialist parties will unite in the main task of the parliament to formulate the constitution of the Fourth French Republic to confront the People's Republican Movement. According to the two parties, they want the parliament to have full power, and make the head of the executive branch a mere formality. The People's Republican Movement advocates the establishment of upper and lower houses, and the president must also have power. Today, the party and the Communist Party had disputes over the announcement of the program, which made the future participation in the new government rather gloomy.

[French News Agency, Paris, 23rd] According to information available from all parties, General de Gaulle will stay for a few days in his Marie Le Roy residence, and is expected to leave for the Sept Fontaines castle in the Ardennes province. He has never expressed any intention of going abroad. He now spends part of his time reading books and taking walks. Except for a few colleagues in his former cabinet, he does not receive any other visitors.

### Gouin's Brief Biography

[Our Newspaper Compilation Room] The new French President Gouin was born in Bayonne in 1884. Both his parents were teachers. At the age of twenty, Gouin studied law and joined the Socialist Party. In May 1911, he was appointed as a member of the Aix-en-Provence Provincial Assembly. In 1914, World War I broke out, and Gouin joined the army. After the end of the European War, he was appointed as a member of the Civil and Criminal Law Committee of the Parliament and also served as a member of the Finance Committee. After the German-French truce in July 1940, Gouin voted against Pétain. The French Socialist Party maintained close contact with the resistance forces, and Gouin made great contributions. In early 1942, Gouin left France and was detained in Spain, but arrived in London in August of the same year. In 1943, he went to Algiers and was elected as the vice chairman of the Provisional Advisory Committee. Gouin returned to France in August 1944. Although Gouin is from southern France, he has no radical temperament.

[Reuters, Paris, 24th] The new French Head of Government Gouin told reporters last night that he intended to ask Bidault to remain as Foreign Minister so that he could return to London as soon as possible and continue his work at the United Nations General Assembly.

### American Chemists Study Modernization of Food to Match the Atomic World

Researchers have recently discovered that high-frequency currents are sufficient to preserve the nutritional value of fruits and vegetables. It is said that recent experimental results show that using electric current to cook vegetables instead of steam or boiling water reduces the loss of vitamin C from 30% to 40% to 3%.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd] The Japanese government underwent a significant change today. All parliamentary vice-ministers and councillors of each ministry have submitted their resignations to assist the Shidehara Cabinet in holding a future general election in the fairest manner possible.

[United Press, Washington, 23rd] According to sources, the U.S. government has requested Congress to allocate $2 million to be managed by the State Department in the next fiscal year to carry out propaganda work in China and other parts of the Far East. This work will be undertaken by American personnel and will involve the dissemination of factual reports based on American life and endeavors. Most of the personnel will be stationed in China, with expenses set at $600,000. Some members of Congress intend to criticize this plan, but it is believed that it will be passed by Congress. It is noted that the United States has already been implementing a temporary program of the same nature in the Far East, but on a smaller scale.

### Local Correspondences

Jinshan: Establishing Information Offices to Disrupt the Locality

Recently, a person in this county claiming to be the head of a Military Intelligence Bureau agency, Ni Sheng-san, who is the alias of Ni Jian-ping, the former puppet district chief of Lüxiang in Mao Port. He collected military rice to aid the enemy during the enemy-puppet era. Now, he has transformed himself, claiming to be an intelligence officer, and has arbitrarily established an information office, appointing dozens of people to spread throughout the county, defrauding the people. Many innocent civilians, such as Gu Hong-shu and Sun Yong-yu, have been victimized. In addition to infringing on their personal freedom, they have been extorted for millions of puppet currency. Fair-minded people in the locality, in view of the fact that Ni is still daring to disrupt the locality on this victorious and bright day, which is extremely unlawful, have jointly sent telegrams to the relevant authorities, requesting a swift and thorough investigation and strict handling.

Changshu: Provincial Government Sends Personnel to Investigate Tax Grain

Wang Kun-shan, the former puppet county magistrate, levied and stored 2,000 dan of tax grain in the 33rd year of the Republic. The Vanguard Army Headquarters had previously reported this to the Provincial Government. After the county government was restored, this tax grain was never received. Because Wang Kun-shan has now fled, the Provincial Government, in addition to issuing a warrant for his arrest, has recently sent Commissioner Yu Jun-yuan to Changshu to thoroughly investigate the personnel involved, to determine whether there was any embezzlement, in order to uncover the truth.

Suzhou: Garrison Troops Given Deadline to Suppress Lake Bandits

Robberies in the Suzhou countryside have been frequently reported recently. The Suzhou-Hangzhou ferry was robbed by bandits at Jiapu Bridge the day before yesterday, and passengers were shot and injured. The firearms of the escorting soldiers were also seized. When the news arrived, the Fuxing Steamer, which also runs between Suzhou and Hangzhou, was also attacked yesterday on its way from Hangzhou to Suzhou when passing Jiapu Bridge. At night, gunshots suddenly rang out, and the escorting soldiers returned fire. For a while, both sides exchanged bullets like rain. The bandits were unprepared and fled towards Tai Lake. The body of a bandit was found killed on the shore. A passenger named Xu A-yue was injured by a stray bullet, and the ship itself was also damaged in several places. After opening to Suzhou, repairs were carried out immediately. Because the Suzhou-Hangzhou route was robbed twice in the same place within two days, merchants were wary. Therefore, the Suzhou-Hangzhou ferry suspended operations on the 23rd. They also requested the authorities to suppress the bandits. Upon hearing the report, Ma Zong-zhi, the Commander-in-Chief of the Loyalty and Rescue Army stationed in Suzhou, specially dispatched Ren Xian-ting, the commander of the Third Detachment, to rush to suppress the bandits, with a deadline to clear them out by the end of this month.

Liyang: Murderer of Martyr Executed by Firing Squad; Enemy Military Agent Ma Li-xing, who committed many evils during the Japanese occupation of Liyang. His most vicious act was the murder of Di Wei-cheng. It was found that Di was a graduate of the fifth class of the Whampoa Military Academy and had engaged in underground work and anti-Japanese activities. After Ma discovered this, he captured Di and put him in a hemp sack, strangled him to death, then cut his body into several pieces and buried him in the soil. He also forcibly occupied Di's wife. Di's wife had to temporarily endure the humiliation in order to avenge her husband. Today, when the sun has shone again, Li Huan-wei, the leader of the Liyang Group of the Jinghu Garrison Pacification Work Supervision Group, upon arriving in Liyang, Di's wife reported the injustice and denounced Ma, who was captured and interrogated. After the facts were confirmed, he was executed by firing squad on the 14th, to the great satisfaction of the people.

Wuhu: Suspension of Dismantling of Jing-Wu Railway Tracks

The dismantling of the railway tracks from Nanjing to Wuhu, originally scheduled for the 20th of this month to supplement the Jinpu Trunk Line, has been suspended because the weight of the railway tracks could not be matched. Normal traffic will continue. In addition, since the Wuhu Water and Electricity Plant was taken over by the Provincial Government and run as a public utility after the victory, the electricity rate is now 250 yuan per kilowatt-hour, which is more than four times higher than that of Nanjing and Shanghai. The burden on users is too heavy, and it is stimulating various commodity prices. There has been a unanimous demand for an immediate price reduction to reduce the burden on residents.

### U.S. Navy Tests Atomic Bomb Power; Location is North of the Marshall Islands; About One Hundred Various Ships Participate

[Associated Press, Washington, 24th] The United States Navy announced today the atomic bomb attack test plan. This experiment will fundamentally change naval operations. The test is scheduled to begin on May 1st, with 97 ships participating, from aircraft carriers to battleships to submarines and transport ships, all as giant targets. Each ship will be anchored on Bikini Island, north of the Marshall Islands, with the lagoon serving as the test site. Vice Admiral Buckeridge, Special Director of the Navy, released the following details: The attacked fleet will include four U.S. aircraft carriers, five submarines, and nineteen destroyers; the German cruiser "Prinz Eugen" and the Japanese battleship "Nagato" and a light cruiser. This is not a joint or international action, but a scientific experiment conducted solely by the United States government. Each target, whether destroyed or damaged, will be arranged in different ways. The first test is scheduled to take place in early May, with an atomic bomb detonating hundreds of feet above the fleet. The second test is tentatively scheduled for July, with an atomic bomb detonating on the surface of the water. Afterwards, about fifty deep-water tests will be conducted in the high seas. Fifty U.S. Navy ships and 20,000 personnel will be deployed for this test and record the results. U.S. ships selected as targets include the cruisers Nevada, Saratoga, Independence, and Fall River; the battleships Arkansas, Pennsylvania, New York. The main objective of the test is to determine the impact of atomic bombs on naval vessels in order to obtain valuable information for national defense. The secondary objective is to train air force personnel in conducting atomic bomb attacks on ships in order to determine the effectiveness of atomic bombs on military facilities and equipment. The latest scientific techniques and equipment will be used during the experiment to observe, measure, and report the effects of the atomic bomb. Observers will include Congressional, Army, Navy, and scientific personnel, as well as journalists. The issue of inviting foreign representatives and foreign journalists is being considered jointly by the heads of the Army, Navy, and State Departments. As for the ships used for the test in the field, they will be naval vessels from the United States, Germany, and Japan, with the German heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen being the main target of the atomic bomb. The ship was damaged by bombing by the United Nations Air Force but did not sink. It arrived in Boston this Wednesday. The Japanese main battleship Nagato, undefended in Tokyo Bay, but still intact, will also be used as a major target. The former flagship of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, the Pennsylvania, which was attacked in Pearl Harbor and repaired for months before rejoining the fleet, and the Nevada, which was also damaged in Pearl Harbor, will both be used as test subjects after repairs. In addition, several destroyers and submarines will be added. The experiment will begin around May 1st and will continue until the technical experts have collected all the materials, hopefully ending by July 4th.

### Please Listen to the People's Voices: Speak More Justly: Sixteen Provinces' Compatriots Hold Tea Party to Appeal to Representatives of the Political Consultative Conference: Airmail Report from This Newspaper on the 18th, Sent by Zhao Hao-sheng from the War-time Capital

For the past nine days, I, as a reporter, have often heard many representatives in the Political Consultative Conference loudly proclaiming "The People!" "The People!" In order to explain their opinions, they often use "the meaning of the people" and "for the people" as the basis for their arguments in their speeches. "The People" is such a glorious word, and "the voice of the people" is so loud! However, where is the real voice of the people? What do the people hope for and demand?

On the evening of the 18th, on the day the eighth session of the Political Consultative Conference—the discussion on the National Assembly issue—ended, in the auditorium of the Victory Building in the war-time capital, the fellow-provincials associations in Chongqing of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Chahar, Suiyuan, Jehol, Jiangsu, Anhui, Guangdong, Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Beiping, and Tianjin, sixteen provinces and cities, held a tea party to entertain the representatives of the Political Consultative Conference in order to express their hopes and ask them to listen to the real voice of the people.

Because it represents the prayers and aspirations in the hearts of millions of people, the atmosphere of this tea party made people feel particularly solemn and heavy.

Mr. Pei Ming-yu was the first to stand up and speak on behalf of the repatriation promotion associations of various fellow-provincial associations. The repatriation promotion association is the organization that coordinates the repatriation of millions of compatriots who are eager to return to their hometowns from the rear area. However,

Looking east at the distant homeland, the road is long and arduous. Until now, everyone is still at a loss. Mr. Pei said with a sigh in his voice that since the victory, none of the compatriots who had been wandering in the rear area did not hope to return to their hometowns and reunite with their families as soon as possible. However, today there are still many unlawful troops carrying out acts of oppression and trampling on the people. If the representatives truly think of the common people, they should first quickly disarm these unlawful troops that harm the people. Under the principle of nationalization of the army, incorporate them into the National Army system, because in a state of unified military orders, even if there are acts of disturbing the people, the common people can still have a channel to report their grievances, otherwise the people will

never have peaceful days. In addition, he hoped for unified administrative orders. He said: "Any faction that wants to split the government is a public enemy of the people. Our common people must resist." Finally, he said earnestly, word by word, "The representatives should respect the interests of the people more and think less about the private interests of the party. Only in this way can they be true representatives of the people."

Mr. Xiang Ju-tan said in his speech that he recently received a letter from Jiangsu, knowing that

the elders in his hometown, who had endured eight years of suffering, are still in dire straits today. Today, he wants to appeal to the representatives of the Political Consultative Conference on behalf of these suffering people, especially to his old friend Mr. Liang Shuming, and express a hope that Mr. Liang can use the spirit of running rural education to speak more justly and compassionately in the conference hall. He hoped that the representatives would pay attention to maintaining the existing laws and disciplines of the country and not destroy unity or shake the foundations of the nation.

Mr. Liang Shuming stood up to speak. Just like the other representatives of the Democratic League said in the Political Consultative Conference, he also said that the Democratic League is not a political party. He said that he would not participate in politics and would continue to do cultural work. In order to respond to Mr. Xiang's expectations, he emphasized: "I believe my actions will certainly live up to the expectations of all the friends present." Mr. Liang spoke in this venue

in front of the representatives of sixteen provinces, and his attitude seemed much more cautious than in the general assembly.

Mr. Ma Cun-kun, the representative of Anhui, brought up the "Draft Program for Peaceful National Reconstruction" published by the Chinese Communist Party. He said that this proposal to form a separatist regime: "We, the people, do not agree!"

Mr. Duan Yong-qing spoke on behalf of the elders of Hebei Province. He also said: The people will despise those who do not obey the government's policy of peaceful unification!

Mr. Chen Qitian, representing the Youth Party, explained their proposals of "nationalization of the army" and "democratization of politics" put forward in the Political Consultative Conference, and believed that this time, through consultation, a satisfactory effect could be achieved. Mr. Qi Yan-ming, the representative of the Chinese Communist Party, also believed that

the day for the people to return to their hometowns should be coming soon. Mr. Chen Lifu, the representative of the government, spoke for the first time at the Political Consultative Conference that day. Here, he still explained with the same sincerity as in the general assembly that the most important thing at present is to quickly restore transportation and start peaceful reconstruction work. He said: China is now

moving from a one-party political system to a multi-party political system. Under a multi-party political system, if political parties have armies, the country will never have peace.

The tea party ended at ten o'clock. On this night of power outage in Chongqing, the moonlight was like water. I looked up at the round and bright moon and suddenly realized that it was only half a month away from the Lunar New Year. The family reunion that had been longed for for eight years should be realized, right? "While the sun shines, we must sing aloud and indulge in wine, and we should return to our hometowns with our friends!" This joyful dream, like a poem, should be enjoyed by the people who have been wandering in suffering for eight years?

### The New Exchange Rate and the National Goods Movement

The new exchange rate, which is attracting attention from all parties, will be announced soon. There are various rumors on the market. Some speculate that the U.S. exchange rate will be between 1,500 and 2,000, while others advocate adopting a free exchange rate in the short term.

Premise

We all place great expectations on this new exchange rate, which is related to the future destiny of the country. There is no other reason, that is, we hope that the people of the country will work hard to develop export trade, obtain a large amount of foreign exchange, and exchange it for a large number of production machines, so as to achieve self-sufficiency in major goods and no longer rely on other countries. Therefore, the re-establishment of the exchange rate should be based on encouraging exports and absolutely preventing the import of large quantities of consumer goods.

Reviewing our country's export trade, before the war, it was mainly raw materials. The light industrial products of the Japanese in the past, such as cotton textiles, etc., occupied vast markets overseas in the South Sea Islands, Africa, and South America. After the defeat of Japan, we can take advantage of this opportunity, make efforts to produce in the enemy-puppet factories that have been taken over, and replace Japan's pre-war position. After our country's victory and in the early stage of recovery, the trade deficit is inevitable. We sincerely hope that the government can find ways to balance it. At the same time, on the people's side, we should practice frugality, reduce or eliminate secondary consumption, and absolutely save all imported goods, so as to preserve valuable foreign exchange. At the same time, we still need to put forward an old slogan: Promote National Goods.

National Goods

Although the phrase "Promote National Goods" has become a buzzword for the past twenty years, please ask yourselves, fellow compatriots, have you earnestly followed these four words? Especially in the current post-victory society, the trend of extravagance has increased. Social figures take pride in enjoying imported goods. We must know that the economic and industrial prosperity of a country is built on the consumption of the vast majority of the people. Therefore, promoting national goods, in a positive sense, should awaken industrial manufacturers to strive for technological improvement. In a negative sense, we should cultivate the people's psychology of loving and using national goods. Regarding "Promoting National Goods," how should we promote it? Now let's briefly describe it in several aspects:

Society

Our country's social organization is complex and unsystematic. In the future, after order is roughly established, local autonomy institutions will be established? We can use the Baojia system to promote the atmosphere of promoting national goods in society.

Manufacturers

In the few months after the victory, the factories in the rear area collapsed, shut down, or requested government relief. In Shanghai, all domestic products are being overwhelmed by cheap goods from overseas. Importers are busy soliciting orders. If our country's manufacturers do not strive to improve themselves in this environment, I am afraid they will be eliminated by the times. Regarding product quality, they should strive for improvement so as not to create opportunities for foreign goods to invade. The selling price of finished products should be as low as possible, so that the people will naturally be happy to use national goods.

In this way, the "Three No's" of Henry Ford's automobile manufacturing plant in the United States can give our manufacturers a model: (1) Do not use cheap workers (increase salaries appropriately to stabilize workers' lives), (2) Do not work beyond eight hours (strive to reduce working hours to improve work efficiency), (3) Do not exceed the selling price of equivalent goods (low selling price, excellent products). This point depends on the joint efforts of manufacturers and laborers.

Government

It is necessary to coordinate a good plan, urge the local government that is close to the people, lead the masses, and promote the promotion of national goods. We must know that this movement can lay the foundation for national prosperity. Civil servants should set an example in terms of daily clothing, and try their best to use national goods as a guide for the masses.

The thirty-fourth year of the Republic has passed. The earth has returned to spring, and everything has begun. We sincerely hope that our government will give deep consideration to the re-establishment of the new exchange rate, and we hope that the people of the whole country will work together with one heart and mind to actively promote the "Promote National Goods" movement.

### The Specific Propositions of Overseas Chinese Regarding National Policy

Government and military orders must be unified, and National Assembly representatives can only be supplemented.

The foundation of the nation cannot be shaken, and the fruits of victory cannot be discarded.

To the Editor: The various overseas Chinese organizations in the wartime capital held a meeting on the Political Consultative Conference and sent a letter to all members and compatriots across the country, hoping to have it published in your esteemed newspaper to express public opinion.

The Political Consultative Conference includes thirty-eight social elites, representatives from various parties and factions. We overseas Chinese, numbering in the tens of millions, were not granted a seat to participate in the discussions, which we deeply regret. However, if the participating gentlemen can truly uphold the principles of mutual love and sincerity, seek a good path towards national unity and solidarity, and lead the country to prosperity and strength, then our wishes will be fulfilled, and we will not insist on fighting for representation or forcefully making demands. The current conference has been underway for a week, and speeches fill the halls. Where is the path to unity? The ceasefire order has been issued, but local conflicts are still raging. Considering the future of our nation, we feel a bitter taste in our mouths and must speak out!

Overseas Chinese reside in foreign lands, living under the roof of others. Our intentions are very simple: the unity and strength of our motherland. To achieve this goal, for the past fifty years, we have assisted the Father of the Nation in overthrowing the Manchu Qing dynasty and completing the national revolution. We have supported the Kuomintang in eliminating warlords and completing the national unification movement. We have also supported the government in persevering in the War of Resistance and completing the national liberation movement. We have contributed money and effort, sparing no sacrifice. This heart and this will have remained unchanged over time. Now that victory has arrived and the nation is beginning to be built, the situation of unity is suddenly cast into the shadow of division and separatism, and the ranks of solidarity are marred by the bad news of military conflicts. Who is creating civil war? Who is encouraging civil war? From the standpoint of the people, we have long seen it clearly. We hope that the propagandists of various parties and factions will no longer wag their tongues, constantly invoking "the people" and "the masses," even mentioning how overseas Chinese are somehow representative, because it is not enough to represent the genuine people. We have long discerned where the crux of unity and solidarity lies. However, today's problem is not about discussing rights and wrongs or merits and demerits, but how to ensure unity and solidarity. Only when unity is successful and solidarity is realized can we talk about peaceful nation-building. Otherwise, the haze of peace will be difficult to clear away forever, and the obstacles to nation-building cannot be removed. In the past week, what efforts have the esteemed gentlemen made to promote unity? What contributions have they made to consolidate solidarity? The plans of various parties seem to be far apart and difficult to compromise. We now wish to state the observations of overseas Chinese on the issue of unity and solidarity, and we wish to solemnly reaffirm the strong desire of overseas Chinese for the unity and strength of the motherland. Please discuss them separately as follows:

First, the issue of unity. What is unity? It means the complete exercise of administrative power by the government. If the participating gentlemen have the sincerity to promote unity, they should find ways to bring the independent governments under the central government and reorganize the autonomous armies into the national army, in order to achieve the unity of government and military orders. Because today's National Government is not only recognized by all countries in the world, but also jointly recognized by all parties and factions as the unshakable foundation for a unified country. However, how to reorganize the governments of the "Border Regions" and "Liberated Areas," how to reorganize the Communist armies and all miscellaneous troops, is the specific step towards unifying government and military orders. Regarding the latter, the Military Tripartite Group has already been jointly deliberating. Regarding the former, why have the representatives of various parties neglected to discuss it and focused on the reorganization of the National Government's structure? This is truly incomprehensible. The government previously indicated that it would open up political power and recruit talents from all sides, and even proposed implementing universal suffrage at the county level. It is heard that Mr. Liang Shuming, a member of the Democratic League, advocated specializing the three provinces of Rehe, Chahar, and Hebei, with parties sending members to form the government, and even argued that Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Xikang could do the same. If feasible, how many talents from the Village Governance Faction are capable of serving as high officials of the entire province? Mr. Zhang Dongsun even strongly pointed out that the national army is a party army, speaking up for the Chinese Communist Party. If what he says is true, then the millions of officers and soldiers who died in the War of Resistance will not rest in peace! If Mr. Zhang had not been trapped in Beiping during the War of Resistance but had been in the rear, he would have opposed the full-scale War of Resistance led by the Kuomintang and advocated evading military service to avoid being used by the Kuomintang. All such irresponsible remarks are by no means a good manifestation of democratic politics and may hinder the harmony of the atmosphere inside and outside the conference. We oppose this kind of extraneous fallacy and firmly advocate the unification of government and military orders under the central government.

Second, the issue of solidarity. It is undeniable that solidarity is based on democracy. However, democracy requires long-term effort and cannot be achieved overnight. The progress of the British civil rights movement has taken thousands of years to reach the current scale of constitutional monarchy. Although the United States was founded later, its people came from the Old World and have an innate understanding of exercising civil rights. China has only been established for thirty-four years, plagued by internal and external troubles and has never had a peaceful day. The Kuomintang has been in power for only twenty years, suppressing internal rebellion and leading the War of Resistance. In this turmoil, political tutelage is difficult to succeed. It is impossible to achieve success overnight and be able to compete with advanced countries like Britain and the United States. The Chinese Communist Party often boasts of the "people's democratic" councils in the border areas and liberated areas, but whether they are monopolized by one party and how much democratic composition they have is not difficult to judge fairly with common sense. If various parties and factions insist on not yielding and compete for the re-election of the National Assembly, it is meaningless. Moreover, there are currently more than 900 representatives in the National Assembly. Whether today's so-called various parties and factions possess the popular will represented by these more than 900 people is doubtful. We believe that national affairs are not child's play. Since the National Assembly representatives have been elected according to law and have not yet performed their duties, neither the government nor any party can unilaterally deny them with a single order. Otherwise, the National Assembly representatives can rise up to fight for the protection of civil rights, and the broad masses of the people will still be the backing of the National Assembly representatives to seek the promotion of human rights, then China's political disputes will never be resolved. We hope that the government can make more concessions and hold supplementary elections with more quotas. If various parties and factions must insist on re-election, they must also carefully examine whether their parties have made great contributions to our country and have not committed crimes that harm the people in the process of the national revolution. The Kuomintang has the great achievements of overthrowing the Manchu Qing dynasty, establishing the Republic of China, suppressing internal rebellion, and leading the War of Resistance. Moreover, its Three Principles of the People's nation-building strategy is the highest guiding principle for nation-building accepted by the people of the whole country and even various parties. The direction of people's hearts and the number of victories and defeats must be considered by various parties. We believe that in the transitional period before the National Assembly, the powers of the National Political Council should be expanded and its membership expanded to accommodate talents from all sides, making it a democratic parliament similar to the British and American models, so as to fulfill its function of uniting the strength of the whole country and supervising the government's administration.

Third, the aspirations of overseas Chinese for the motherland. For hundreds of years, overseas Chinese have been under the rule of colonial governments, and the spiritual pain they have suffered is beyond description. Especially when the Manchu Qing dynasty was weak and the country had fallen into a semi-colonial status, overseas Chinese were even worse than slaves and animals in the eyes of foreigners. Fortunately, the great revolutionary leader, Father of the Nation Sun Yat-sen, led the Kuomintang in carrying out the national revolution, and the future of the new China gradually dawned. Now, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek led the army in the Northern Expedition, completing unification, resisting foreign aggression, and leading the War of Resistance. Unexpectedly, with the arrival of victory, there are still bad phenomena of feudal separatism and wielding troops for self-aggrandizement. Those who are ignorant of the matter are even helping to fuel the specialization of local political power and the brewing of de facto independence, causing all the government's steps in restoration and nation-building to suffer endless obstacles. We firmly support the Three Principles of the People and oppose undermining the unity of the nation and the people. The result of the bloody sacrifices of millions of revolutionary martyrs and fallen soldiers is the foundation of the nation today, the fruits of victory, which cannot be discarded by a few soulless ambitious people. We yearn for China's unity and strength, and we also hope that the government's administration will strive for progress. The biggest problem with today's government administration is the corruption of some officials and the abandonment of discipline and laws. We are keenly aware of the revolutionary struggle history of the Kuomintang and deeply know that the Kuomintang, in its position of being in power, bears the heavy responsibility of the country and must broadly recruit talents. However, it is inevitable that corrupt forces and political opportunists will take the opportunity to invade, causing the evils of bureaucracy, while most of the true Kuomintang members are hardworking, clean and self-respecting people, and their great contribution and hard work in the War of Resistance and nation-building cannot be erased by propaganda and attacks. We believe that only the Kuomintang has the great leadership force to complete the construction of a new China based on the Three Principles of the People. Here, we sincerely hope that the first major party with fifty years of glorious revolutionary history will strive for progress and shoulder its historical mission.

In summary, what I have said is not a profound theory. We believe that today's political consultation is necessary due to the intertwined and complex domestic and international situations, and it is also a last resort. After all, today, after winning the war, the country has entered the ranks of the four great powers, and there can be no more internal disturbances and self-harm. Especially during the eight years of the War of Resistance, the people in the occupied areas were in deep water and hot fire, eagerly hoping that the government would come to rescue them from hunger and thirst, like looking to the clouds during a severe drought. The government is taking all measures to save the people and recover lost territory, and the Chinese Communist Party cannot rely on liberation to share the surrender and come out to obstruct it. Even if it has any reason, it violates the principle of unified government and military orders and cannot be strongly defended by propaganda. The people cannot be deceived and are not ignorant of the truth. For twenty years, the compatriots in the country have suffered from war and are exhausted from running around! We sincerely hope that the Communist Party can cease fire and negotiate a truce, hand over the army to the country, and set a good example for democratic politics. We especially hope that other parties and factions other than the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, although not representatives of the people, must still make good arguments for the unity, prosperity, and happiness of the country and the welfare of the people. Do not think that the contradiction between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and fully strive for the privacy of one party. It must be known that the mission of political consultation is to seek national unity and solidarity, not a venue for various parties to compete for political power. We believe that the Kuomintang's proposition of returning power to the people, not to the party, is absolutely correct. Only the National Assembly, which represents the will of the people, can accept political power. Various parties and factions are by no means representatives of the people. Only those who have been elected by the people through elections can represent the people. If three people can form a party and five people can form a faction, all can influence politics and control political power, then our ten million overseas Chinese can organize ten million parties, and the compatriots of the whole country can organize tens of millions of parties. In this way, can it still be called a country? We must not set this bad precedent in the history of the new Chinese political system at the time when we are beginning to implement democratic constitutionalism. In the ongoing conference, some people are afraid to mention the word "spoils." I believe that you gentlemen do not need to be taboo. Are you here for the benefit of the country and the people, or are you here to compete for official positions and representation? Only facts can explain! The people are the most just judges. Everything in the conference is open. We are willing to hear your high opinions and wait and see what happens. May the gentlemen not forget the sincere wishes of the one million overseas Chinese for the unity and prosperity of the motherland! May the gentlemen not forget the sincere wishes of the 450 million compatriots in the country for the unity and prosperity of the country! The Nanyang Overseas Chinese Association, the Overseas Chinese Aspiring Association, the China Overseas Cultural Undertakings Promotion Association, the Overseas Chinese Returned to Chongqing Association, the Overseas Chinese Youth Service Undertakings Promotion Society, the Overseas Chinese Mutual Aid Society, the Overseas Chinese Youth Association, the Siamese Overseas Chinese Mutual Aid Society, the Netherlands East Indies Overseas Chinese Association, and the entire membership of the Burmese Overseas Chinese Rehabilitation Committee jointly proclaimed.

### An Illustrated Explanation of the United Nations Structure, Its Organization, and Its Powers. See Details in the Following Description. Special Drawings by the Newspaper's Data Room

The United Nations organization was established based on the World Charter passed by the San Francisco Conference on June 26, 1945. Countries that drafted and ratified the Charter officially became member states of the United Nations. In addition, other countries can also join with the recommendation of the Security Council and the approval of the General Assembly.

The member states that have already joined are China, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, the Commonwealth of Australia, Belgium, Canada, Costa Rica, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Greece, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, India, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Norway, Panama, Poland, the Union of South Africa, Yugoslavia, France, Denmark, Mexico, the Philippines, Abyssinia, Iraq, Brazil, Bolivia, Iran, Iceland, Colombia, Liberia, Chile, Ecuador, Egypt, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, Venezuela, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Ukraine, Lebanon, Belarus, Argentina, and Syria, etc., totaling fifty-one countries.

The internal organization of the United Nations organization is very complex, so the average newspaper reader often does not understand it very well, or even has no clue. In order to help them increase their understanding, this newspaper specially uses an illustrative method to introduce in detail the basic knowledge about this large organization.

The above diagram shows the main organizational situation of the United Nations organization, showing its mutual relationships in its entire leadership system. The places drawn with dashed lines indicate relationships that have not yet been established.

(1) United Nations General Assembly: Each member state sends one representative to attend the General Assembly. It sets up three main institutions, and its task is to discuss any issues concerning world peace and submit recommendations to the Council.

(2) Security Council: There are eleven directors, including five permanent directors from the five powers, and the other six are elected by the General Assembly for a term of two years. Its task is to establish atomic energy control, investigate international disputes, and take action against aggressor countries when necessary.

(3) Economic and Social Council: There are eighteen directors, elected by the General Assembly, and their task is to help the member states eradicate the economic and social war-causing factors.

(4) International Court of Justice: There are fifteen judges, elected by the General Assembly. Any disputes between countries that can be judged are decided by the International Court of Justice.

(5) Trusteeship Council: The five powers are natural directors, and countries that manage colonies are also placed on the board of directors.

(6) Secretariat: There is one Secretary-General, and a number of researchers and clerks who are responsible for handling all the documents of the United Nations General Assembly and reporting to the General Assembly and the Security Council.

(7) International Bank for Reconstruction and Development: Part of the Bretton Woods monetary fund plan, approved by thirty-five countries, and responsible for providing construction funds.

(8) International Monetary Fund: Also part of the Bretton Woods plan, its purpose is to help member states stabilize their currency systems.

(9) United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization: This is a research organization that will be committed to improving the world's food and nutrition standards.

(10) International Civil Aviation Organization: Established in 1944, specializing in handling economic and legal issues related to commercial air transport.

(11) Atomic Energy Commission: Composed of the eleven directors of the Security Council and Canada, it studies the problems caused by the discovery of atomic energy.

(12) Military Staff Committee: Composed of the Chiefs of Staff of China, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and France, it directs the troops to resist aggressor countries under the order of the Council.

(13) International Army: Composed of troops sent by the member states of the United Nations organization, to contain any threat to peace.

The Charter stipulates that three steps can be taken in resolving international disputes: The first step is discussion. Any country can appeal to the Security Council and request a public hearing of the report, even if the dispute involves one of the five powers, there is no exception. The second step is investigation and recommendations. Measures such as negotiation, mediation, or arbitration can be taken, or a local solution can be made, or the case can be handed over to the World Court for handling. The third step is action. According to the Charter, the Security Council can order the Military Staff Committee to use international force, first implementing demonstrations and blockades, and then carrying out other military actions.

World Oddities: Three-Wheeled Car

American automaker Calais Davis has made plans to manufacture three-wheeled cars and may begin manufacturing them in California within six months. This car weighs one thousand pounds and has several types of cylinders, such as four-cylinder, six-cylinder, and eight-cylinder. The four-cylinder type can travel forty miles per gallon of gasoline, the usual speed is 65 miles per hour, and the maximum speed is 80 miles per hour. (Translated from "Business Week").

Good News for the Blind

The U.S. Army Signal Corps is now working on creating a radar-like "observational eye." Once this work is completed, blind people will have the hope of seeing the light of day again. It is said that the auxiliary equipment of the "observational eye" is a luminous instrument, not radio waves. The auxiliary device weighs about nine pounds and is shaped like a square box. Its light forms a bright spot on any object, and the light spot immediately reflects the shape of the object being illuminated in the box. The "observational eye" can see from a distance of two feet to twenty feet. Therefore, with this instrument, blind people will be able to see everything again. (Translated from "The New York Times").

Colorful Facsimile

The inventor of the American color wireless facsimile instrument, Colmacbi, has also invented a radar wireless facsimile instrument. The facsimile rate of this facsimile machine is ten times faster than that of ordinary facsimile machines. After the radio station adopts the radar facsimile machine, its broadcast programs will be presented in color and in twice as much detail as before to the listening audience. (Translated from "The New York Times").

New Rat Poison

An American fish and seafood company has invented a rat poison called "1080," which is a very good rat poison in the United States. It is tasteless and extremely potent. However, because the average person is in danger of dying if they accidentally take one-fiftieth of an ounce of the drug, it is still not allowed to be used. The only manufacturer of "1080" announced that it would not sell it except to supply it to epidemic prevention personnel. (Translated from "Time").

Editorial

### The Issue of Revising Import and Export Tariff Rates

Current indications suggest that the government is actively utilizing tariff policies. For example: (1) Exempting items such as honey, black tea, brick tea, coarse and fine summer cloth, sorghum, and millet from taxation; (2) Planning to reduce import taxes on industrial production machinery while increasing tax rates on all luxury goods, with rumors that export tariffs will be revised to 7.5% ad valorem. Import tariffs on food, excluding foreign rice, will be set at 16.5% ad valorem; (3) Taxable prices for foreign goods will be uniformly based on the wholesale market price at the port of entry. While some of these measures may have already been implemented, and others are still under consideration, all represent the utilization of tariff policies to achieve protective or fiscal objectives. After enduring nearly a century of treaty tariffs and treaty-set customs values, we find these developments quite encouraging.

What remains unclear is whether the policy currently adopted is primarily protectionist or fiscal. Based on the aforementioned indications, it appears to be a combination of both. For instance, the 7.5% ad valorem export tariff, the exemption of certain export goods, the high tariffs on imported luxury goods, and the reduction in machinery tax rates all suggest this dual intention.

Given the current state of banknote issuance, the inflation of various temporary expenses, and the financial difficulties facing both the central and local governments, with customs duties remaining the most significant source of revenue, it would be more efficient to focus on moderately increasing tariffs rather than engaging in piecemeal efforts. This approach would save countless administrative and procedural hassles.

Furthermore, it is evident that the domestic industry is nascent, production is lagging, and domestically produced agricultural and industrial goods cannot compete with foreign goods without adequate protection. Therefore, the aforementioned two approaches, working in tandem, are difficult to criticize.

What we want to emphasize now is that whether for revenue or protection, proper implementation is crucial to avoid missing the original objectives. Regarding export goods, unless required for domestic production needs, they should generally be exempt from taxation. The imposition of a 7.5% tax is, of course, intended to generate revenue. However, if this tax on exports affects their sales, preventing them from competing with similar goods from other countries in the international market, then not only will the industry suffer, but the anticipated tax revenue will also fail to materialize. Therefore, we believe that this type of export tax should be appropriately adjusted based on market conditions. Whether it's light or heavy, it shouldn't solely rely on subjective standards or be completely uniform for the sake of procedural convenience. For example, the competitiveness of Taiwanese camphor and minerals such as antimony and tungsten from Hunan and Yunnan is relatively strong, so a slight increase in their tax rates wouldn't be significantly detrimental. As for raw silk, although our main competitor, Japanese silk, has declined, it is said that Shanghai can only export less than 20,000 bales, while Japan still has 300,000 bales in stock, not including the 100,000 bales already shipped to the United States after the war (enough for about three months of American consumption). Coupled with the remarkable development of American-produced artificial silk in recent years, it remains uncertain whether taxing Chinese silk will truly restore its sales.

As for the taxation of imported goods, there are various reasons. If it is truly for protection, then it must first be determined: (1) Do we have similar goods that need protection? (2) Is the tax rate high enough to provide protection? In other words, if we don't have similar products, there is no need for protection. If the tax rate is too low, foreign goods can still compete in China, thus failing to achieve the goal of protection. Although it may provide some fiscal relief, it will have lost its original purpose.

Therefore, we believe that the application of tariff policies is extremely complex. We believe that even in simple revenue-generating systems, the techniques are not simple, let alone when implementing protective policies, which naturally require particularly thorough investigation and preparation, and appropriate distinctions. The previous uniform 5% ad valorem method is certainly not applicable, and the new proposed 16.5% ad valorem rule still has room for further discussion.

### U.S. Military Tribunal First Trials Japanese War Criminals Prosecutor Indicts Two Major Charges Hearing Adjourned for Two Weeks

[Our Newspaper] The U.S. War Crimes Tribunal yesterday morning at 10:00 AM held its historic first trial of Japanese war criminals at Tilanqiao Prison.

Heavy Security Inside and Outside the Prison

The Ward Road Prison was heavily guarded, with American military police and Chinese security guards stationed at all four iron gates, conducting strict inspections. News reporters were also required to present special passes issued by the U.S. military to enter and exit. The elevator was operated by an American military police driver. The courtroom was located in the easternmost room on the fourth floor, with the judges facing the door, the Japanese war criminals' seats on the right, and a section for reporters on the left. In addition to the eighteen Japanese war criminals, five judges, two defense attorneys, two prosecutors, three Japanese interpreters, and one female clerk, there were more than thirty reporters and photographers from various newspapers and news agencies, as well as more than forty observers from Chinese and American authorities.

War Criminals Expressionless During Trial

Ten minutes before the trial began, the eighteen Japanese war criminals, escorted by American military police, entered the room in order and took their seats in three rows. They included Major General Masataka Kaburaki, Colonel Kameji Fukumoto, Major Sadatsugu Sakai, Captain Keisuke Kosaka, Brigadier General Tsutomu Fujii, Sergeant Major Shozo Masui, Sergeant Major Hisamatsu , Sergeant Major Kyukichi Yamaguchi, Sergeant Major Takayoshi Tsukada, Sergeant Major Yoshiyuki Takeuchi, Sergeant Major Junichi Fujii, Corporal First Class Private Yu Mizuta, Corporal First Class Private Yosaburo Shirakawa, Private First Class Shoji Nishikawa, Sergeant Major Koichi Matsuda, consular official of the Japanese consulate in Hankou Ryoichi Manabe, police officer of the consulate Shohei Hamada, and interpreter of the Model Youth Corps Takumi Kato. The last three, being non-military personnel, wore civilian clothes, while the rest were in military uniforms. The criminals appeared calm and expressionless, showing no signs of guilt. Several officers even raised their heads indifferently, as if no one else was present.

Lieutenant Colonel Weiss Reads the Charges

At exactly 10:00 AM, the chief presiding judge of the U.S. Military Tribunal, the commander of the U.S. Army Withdrawal Service Group, and the commander of the U.S. Military Supply Department, General Middleton, along with four associate judges, Colonel Spink, Colonel Auster, Colonel Cardue, and Lieutenant Colonel Mitchel, took their seats, and the trial began. First, the prosecutor, Lieutenant Colonel Weiss, announced that the case was against Japanese war criminals, that all eighteen war criminals were present, and that none of the four associate judges were absent, requesting the court to begin the trial. The court's female recorder and three Japanese interpreters stood and took their oaths. Lieutenant Colonel Weiss then announced the first document from General Wedemeyer, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Forces in China, asking the court to accept it. General Middleton declared the document accepted and asked if the defendants had any objections. The deputy defense attorney, Captain Lavell, accompanied by another assistant defense attorney, entered the room and said they had no objections. A Japanese officer representing the defendants also replied that there were no objections. The prosecutor then took his oath. General Middleton and the associate judges also took their oaths. All eighteen war criminals then stood at attention as Lieutenant Colonel Weiss read the two charges. The atmosphere in the courtroom was extremely solemn and tense. Lieutenant Colonel Jones read: "On or about December 16, 1944, these eighteen criminals (listed individually) violated wartime regulations and breached international law in Hankou by deliberately and unlawfully inflicting inhumane and cruel acts on certain American prisoners of war, whose true names are unknown. They paraded them through the streets of Hankou. Also, at the same time, these eighteen Japanese individuals did not hold a trial and subjected three American prisoners of war, whose true names are unknown, to beatings and torture, leading to the death of one."

Request for Adjournment for Retrial

The defense attorney then stated: "We have heard the charges." The chief judge then asked: "Do the defendants have any plea?" The defense attorney replied: "We have no specific plea at this time. We request an adjournment for retrial." He added: "The defendants request an additional two weeks to conduct a thorough investigation. The current defense attorney, Colonel Jenkins, has not yet arrived in Shanghai. The two of us are also newly appointed, so we must request a retrial in two weeks." The prosecutor stood and stated that he did not object to the adjournment. At this point, General Middleton decided to reconvene the trial at 9:00 AM on February 7.

Trial Questions and Answers Recorded and Broadcast

The defense attorney also reported that there were four other Japanese war criminals related to the prosecutor, but they were not included in today's proposal and will be tried separately later. At this time, it was exactly 10:30 AM. The judge first retired, and then the Japanese war criminals were escorted back in line, and the court adjourned.

After leaving the courtroom, reporters' and observers' credentials still had to be checked and returned to the U.S. military, to be retrieved again on February 6. Furthermore, all questions and answers in the courtroom yesterday were recorded by the U.S. military communications department and broadcast to the world yesterday afternoon.

### High Court Criminal Division Continues Trial of Traitors Yesterday Totaling Five Cases

The High Court yesterday also tried five cases of traitors:

Lu Xiling, 42 years old, from Jiashan. In April of the 32nd year and May of the 33rd year, he served as chief detective for the enemy Gendarmerie twice, and he participated in the collection of rice in Yuhuizhen with the enemy army. He also extorted money in Jiashan Chamber of Commerce and arrested patriotic comrades. At half past nine yesterday morning, he was interrogated by Presiding Judge Liu Yugui. The prisoner denied all charges, showing a sneer and saying that it was not true. And said, "If the investigation is justified, it would be fine to shoot him." Then the witness Qian Yaozhen testified, "On July 25th last year, Lu Xiling sent someone to arrest me, forced a confession by torture and pouring cold water, detained me for two days and released me. After his release, Lu also wanted me to work for the enemy's intelligence work." In addition, the Jiashan County Government sent a member to Shanghai to request the High Court to bring the defendant back for trial. The court ruled that the traitor cases were all handled by this court, and there was no need to bring him back. The case was adjourned for a retrial, and the defendant was taken back into custody.

Ling Guangyan

The case was heard again yesterday. The High Court temporarily interrogated him because it had received important documents from all parties. The most powerful evidence was a commemorative photo of Ling's opening banquet at Dafa Company in Suzhou on April 27, 1938, which included Ling and the enemy appeasement team, the Japanese army, and dozens of Japanese men and women, as well as a poem, which is copied below: "The sound of songs in Wu, an enchanting Chen; Cherry plum blooming, surrounding as one family in spring." This case is scheduled to be heard again on the 26th.

Dong Jinfu

Thirty-five years old, from Tianjin. From October 22nd of the 33rd year, he joined the puppet army's 37th Division and served as a major secretary at the Shanghai Office. After the victory, he was arrested by the police station at No. 209 China Hotel, Guizhou Road, and transferred to the High Court Prosecutor's Office, which filed a public prosecution based on the Regulations on Punishing Traitors. At 11:00 AM, he was interrogated by Judge Zhu Zonghai. The prisoner confessed that on October 23rd of the 33rd year, he was introduced by Zhang Dingyi to take care of the household chores at the residence of Ding Shutang, the commander of the 37th Division of the puppet army, in the form of a servant, without knowing a single word, and did not serve as a secretary.

At 3:00 PM, the collegiate panel interrogated Han Shaolin, a third-class signalman in the puppet navy, and Zhang Jingen, a foreman and translator at the enemy field warehouse in Jiading. The prisoners all confessed and were scheduled to be sentenced at 2:00 PM on the 31st of this month.

### Traitor Xia Zhongming is Not Dead

After the former puppet organization special agent, Xia Zhongming, was arrested and detained, he suffered from severe drug addiction. He once fainted from withdrawal, leading to widespread rumors that Xia had died. According to sources close to Xia's family yesterday, Xia's children often visit the detention center to bring food, so he has not died. It is also rumored that the High Court is preparing to try him.

### Army Headquarters Sends Personnel to Jointly Try Jiang Gongmei

[Our Newspaper] After Jiang Gongmei, the former Shanghai Gendarmerie, was escorted from Chongqing to Shanghai, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters has been searching for evidence of crimes for days, and it has come to an end. Commander Qian, for the sake of prudence, sent a telegram to the Army Headquarters to send personnel for a joint trial. It is now known that a senior official from the headquarters arrived in Shanghai by plane a few days ago, and the case is expected to be tried in the military law office within days.

### Two Routes Temporarily Add Fourth-Class Cars

The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway authorities, due to the upcoming Lunar New Year and the large number of passengers, in order to alleviate congestion, have temporarily added fourth-class passenger cars to freight trains from yesterday and the day before yesterday until February 1st. The Beijing-Shanghai line added two trains yesterday, one leaving at 5:30 PM, stopping at Nanjing. Another train leaving at 8:30 PM is a local train, stopping at Zhenjiang. The Shanghai-Hangzhou line added one train from the 23rd, stopping at Hangzhou.

### Gunfire Heard Near Jiangwan Last Night The Cause is Unknown After a Long Time

[United Press Local News] Last night, rumors spread repeatedly that "small-scale conflicts" had occurred in the suburbs, leaving reporters and American officials puzzled. Residents near Jiangwan claimed to have heard gunfire, ranging from machine guns to howitzers. American officials at Jiangwan Airport said they heard sporadic gunfire just after 9 PM, lasting for fifteen to thirty minutes. The details are unknown, but it is speculated that the gunfire came from between Jiangwan Airport and the Qiujiang Wharf. Chinese troops patrol in this area. When our reporter asked a certain American officer, he said: "It is also possible that the Chinese army is holding night exercises. If that is the case, we hope they will notify us in advance."

General Middleton, the Chief Judge, swore to be neutral before the U.S. Military Court Trial of Japanese war criminals.

### Health Bureau Invites Reporters to Visit Various Facilities

— Our Reporter Mai Tian

The Municipal Health Bureau held a city tour yesterday afternoon, inviting more than twenty reporters to take two ambulances. They departed at 2:00 PM, led by Xiang Jingfang, Director of the Environmental Health Department and Director of the Municipal Sanitarium, and first arrived at the Third District Health Center on Baylor Road.

The Work of the Health Center

The Third District Health Center's building is quite elegant. It used to be used by the French Engineering Bureau to treat foreigners. The Chinese clinic was set up in the broken room behind it. The establishment of health centers is based on the division of district offices, with a total of eight centers. The main tasks are: [1] Pharmaceutical management, which is currently starting the investigation work. [2] Environmental sanitation, making the greatest efforts to deal with excrement, garbage, and street cleaning. In addition, food is inspected. A card system is used for every wine stall and restaurant, and investigations are conducted at any time. [3] Epidemic prevention and health care. Recently, six or seven nurses and one doctor have been vaccinating in various schools, and 22,000 people have been vaccinated so far. The second step is to vaccinate in factories and large stores. Groups of more than 100 people can request nurses to come and vaccinate them for free. The Third District Health Center also has a venereal disease prevention and treatment center, which can begin prostitute inspections after consultation with the Social Bureau and the Police Bureau. Currently, the clinic does not have beds, but the registration fee for outpatient visits is only 20 yuan. The obstetrics department has an external delivery department, which sends midwives to the homes of pregnant women to deliver babies every day, and the fees are also very low. Their social service department has specially invited experts to investigate patients' homes and provide free diagnosis and treatment.

Hospital Equipment Complete

The Municipal Second Hospital, located on Duojia Road, a remote part of Nanshi, has a very new building, which was renovated with a large amount of funds after receiving the Nanshi Hospital from the enemy puppets. It now has 50 beds, and will be expanded to 200 beds in the future. The equipment in the hospital is very comprehensive. The fluoroscope is a relic of the former municipal government and is the only one in the municipal hospitals. Each fluoroscopy costs 200 yuan. The second distribution area of the Relief Administration is also located in the hospital.

Large-Scale Slaughterhouse

After circling around Nanshi, we arrived at the slaughterhouse on Shajing Road in Hongkou. As soon as we entered the door, we saw a large pile of slaughtered cattle, ready to be sent to the butcher shop. This slaughterhouse is the largest in Shanghai, established by the Public Works Bureau on December 5, 1933. The beef that Shanghai people eat every day comes from here. Now, 280 large cattle, 20 calves, 140 sheep, and 2 horses are slaughtered every day. Pigs are slaughtered at the Nanyang Bridge Slaughterhouse. There, 100 pigs are slaughtered for the U.S. military every time, six or seven times a month. Livestock are inspected before and after slaughter. Thousands of old cattle in the cowshed, with their heads drooping, were waiting for the arrival of the god of death. Seeing this tragic scene, I couldn't help but feel moved. They slaughter cattle by first applying electricity to the sides of the cattle's ears, which anesthetizes and stuns them. Then they fall down from a rectangular grid, and the workers use knives to kill them. Then they are hooked up by hanging iron hooks, and the heart and lungs are put into a bucket while the skin is peeled off. It only takes ten minutes to complete the slaughter of one head of cattle. There are 31 cattle slaughtering pits in the slaughterhouse. The slaughtering fee is 20 yuan per head of cattle, 11 yuan per pig, and 10 yuan per sheep. Pigs were slaughtered using machines before, but they cannot be used now due to insufficient coal. The Japanese also did not use them for a long time during their occupation.

In the lower slaughterhouse, workers were sawing slaughtered cattle in half with saws, and the cattle feet were hanging separately on iron hooks, dripping with blood. The lives of livestock are ended with such treatment.

Alarming Drug Addicts

Next to the Baziqiao on Yokohama Road, Guanbei, facing the Xiaohongbang River, stands a three-story gray-walled building, which is the Municipal Anti-Smoking Hospital. There are currently 72 beds and 41 male and female smokers, of which 20 have been cured. According to the survey results, 14 people smoke opium, 25 people smoke heroin, and 2 people inject morphine intravenously. There are various reasons for drug use, of which as many as 11 people started smoking for socializing. According to the hospital authorities, there are about 600,000 drug addicts in Shanghai. No wonder the municipal government is so urgent to deal with drug addicts.

Municipal Sanatorium

Finally, we circled around to the Municipal Sanatorium on Daxi Road, which used to be the nurses' dormitory of the Public Works Bureau Hospital. When you walk past the red building on Daxi Road, you will definitely praise the magnificence of this building. The equipment inside is conceivable. There are now 60 patients living in the sanatorium, most of whom are suffering from tuberculosis. The special rooms have bedrooms and reception rooms, and the daily hospitalization fee is 800 to 1,200 yuan. First class is 800 yuan, third class A is free of accommodation fee, and class B is completely free. Currently, because the personnel receiving the Health Bureau have no place to live, they are temporarily using it as a dormitory, and the entire eighth floor is planned to be used as a ward in the future.

Each ward has a balcony, with plenty of light and air, and a quiet environment. This is an ideal place to recover in Shanghai. Even if we don't envy the patients' pain, we must envy them living in such a comfortable environment.

### Demands for Improved Treatment Continue, Various Industries See Further Slowdowns, Mediation in the Department Store Industry Reaches a Dead End

[Report from this newspaper] Workers at eight major department stores, including Wing On, Sincere, The Sun, New Shanghai, Lihua, China National Products, China Emporium, and Youli, staged a three-hour slowdown from 2:00 to 5:00 PM the day before yesterday to demand improved treatment. Yesterday morning, there was still no response from management, so they implemented another slowdown after the noon siren. In addition, the Lian'an Department Store on Lin Sen Middle Road also joined the slowdown starting at 2:00 PM. According to this reporter's investigation, if the labor unrest is not resolved immediately, the labor side is preparing to organize a march of 10,000 department store employees and related workers. The demands put forward by the labor side vary slightly from company to company. Workers at Sincere, The Sun, Lihua, China Emporium, and Youli are demanding a minimum salary of 35,000 yuan, and a salary of 60,000 yuan for section chiefs. Workers at Wing On are demanding a salary increase of 200% based on December salaries, and the implementation of a seniority system, with a 10% increase for every three years of service. The management side is also taking unified action, participating in a wage review meeting at the Social Affairs Bureau at 10:00 AM yesterday, with representatives from municipal administrative agencies in attendance. It is reported that the minimum salary for employees of the eight companies will be 30,000 yuan, with employees responsible for their own food and lodging. As for other details, the labor and management sides will negotiate separately. Throughout yesterday, the labor and management sides did not have any contact. The labor side stated that if they are ignored again, they will implement a strike.

Resolution of Barber Slowdown Expected

Over 1,500 barbershops in this city implemented a full slowdown starting at 10:00 AM yesterday. The labor side's demands are as follows: 35% of the daily revenue of first-class shops should go to worker wages, and 65% should go to management. For second and third-class shops, the labor side should receive 40% and management should receive 60%. Customer tips should be distributed entirely to the workers, and shop owners should not deduct from them. In addition, they are demanding three meals a day, one congee and two rice meals, and that shop owners not dismiss workers without cause, among other nine conditions. At 2:00 PM yesterday, labor and management representatives were dispatched to mediate jointly by the Social Affairs Bureau and the Municipal Party Headquarters. The resolution was that first-class shops would split profits 35% for labor and 65% for management, with two rice meals and one congee provided. Second and third-class shops would split profits 40/60, but with a monthly salary of 1,500 yuan, two congee meals and one rice meal, and the elimination of miscellaneous fees, with other meals remaining the same.

Mediation for the Electric Power Company Tomorrow

After the Shanghai Electric Power Company experienced another slowdown the day before yesterday, all offices of the Electric Power Company were closed yesterday because employees were gathered at the Yangshupu Main Factory. Around 5:00 PM, Zhou Xuexiang, a representative from the General Labor Union, Wang Xianqing, a representative from the Municipal Party Headquarters, and Zhu Chenghao, a representative from the Social Affairs Bureau, went together to persuade them, but the labor side insisted that they would not resume work until all conditions were met to the satisfaction of the management. However, it was guaranteed that the current would not be interrupted. It is reported that the Administrative Standing Committee has decided to convene a final mediation meeting at the Social Affairs Bureau at 10:00 AM on the 26th.

Mediation of the Commercial Press Labor Unrest Today

After all employees of the Commercial Press presented demands for improved treatment, the labor and management sides negotiated on their own without success. They began a slowdown yesterday and sent representatives to petition the Social Affairs Bureau, which agreed to convene both parties for formal mediation at 10:00 AM this morning.

Textile Workers Demand Year-End Bonus

More than 16,000 textile factory workers from 17 factories in this city, including Gongda, Yufeng, and Tongxing, submitted requests to the Cotton Textile Industry Labor Union of the third and fourth districts on the 15th, demanding that year-end bonuses be issued equally, regardless of grade, at one and a half months' salary, and that six yards of Indanthrene cloth be issued to each person in lieu of work clothes, calculated according to recent wages. Based on this, the labor union made an oral request to the management on the 16th, and a written request on the 19th and 23rd. However, there has been no response to date. The workers believe that China Textile Company lacks sincerity, so they slowed down work yesterday. Party and government agencies immediately sent personnel to mediate late at night. It is reported that the management has agreed to issue the six yards of cloth, but the year-end bonus issue still needs to be discussed. It is scheduled that the Social Affairs Bureau will convene mediation together with relevant agencies at 10:00 AM this morning.

Jeep Drivers Given a Deadline to Resume Work

All Chinese drivers, coppersmiths, and laborers, totaling over two thousand, at the U.S. Army Headquarters Transportation Department in Shanghai, have been on a full slowdown since Tuesday of this week, which has not yet been resolved. Before the slowdown, they requested the management authorities to (1) double their wages, (2) issue a one-month year-end bonus, (3) pay the salary increase in U.S. dollars, and (4) not deduct wages for days off. Yesterday, the management authorities issued a notice that all Chinese personnel on slowdown are required to report to work by the 25th, otherwise new workers will be hired to fill the positions.

### The Great Artery of Transportation: Employees of the Two Railways Strictly Guard Their Posts, Inheriting Past Honors to Maintain Transportation

— Reporter of this newspaper, Xingwu

The surging labor unrest has made every Shanghai citizen uneasy. Yesterday morning, on the bustling streets, another kind of green printed leaflet with the signature "Railway Employees" was found. Therefore, rumors flew around, and everyone was worried that Shanghai's great artery would also be swept into the vortex of the labor unrest.

No Signs of Labor Unrest at the Station

In order to understand the truth of the matter, this reporter made a special trip to the North Railway Station. There was nothing unusual at the station, and not a single leaflet could be found. The workers were busy working. I grabbed one and secretly asked him about the motive for posting the "declaration," but unexpectedly, he didn't know anything about it. This was the case for several people in a row. They had no knowledge of any leaflets at all, and there was no sign of labor unrest about to occur. Therefore, I also visited the general stationmaster, Tong Shida. Through his introduction, I also met Ouyang Zhi, the section chief.

Section Chief Expresses Determination to Investigate Conspiracy

Although they knew that there were leaflets being posted outside, they did not yet know the content of the leaflets. After I told him, the section chief was silent for a while and said: "This must be a conspiracy by the 'black hats' who were dismissed from 'Hua Zhen' before. We must investigate!" He also pointed out the recent salary adjustment table for employees, which, according to the orders of the Executive Yuan, is divided into four grades, each divided into six levels. The highest level, super grade one, is 34,000 yuan, and the lowest level, grade C six, is 21,000 yuan. Most of the employees have been given increases of three to five levels this month, in addition to rice subsidies and temporary subsidies. Therefore, the section chief said, "Our wages are more than enough compared to those below us."

Labor Union Declares No Knowledge

At the same time, the councils of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Labor Unions solemnly declared that although the salaries of the employees of the two railways are still insufficient to maintain their livelihoods, they are willing to follow proper procedures and petition the Ministry of Transportation for adjustments. They absolutely do not know anything about the leaflets attacking the railway administration that were discovered on the 16th and yesterday, and do not want to participate. The employees of the two railways are determined to maintain their past honor, love the railway, and strictly guard their posts.

Continuous Improvement of Various Facilities

Section Chief Ouyang also led me to visit various places. First and second-class passengers have waiting rooms, and the brand-new sofas are filled with male and female passengers. Anti-Japanese war paintings hang on the light yellow walls. There are newspapers and paintings, which can truly be said to be perfect! The ladies in the broadcasting room report every three to five minutes, providing guidance to passengers at any time. The platforms are swept clean, and the newly renovated dining cars are already serving on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines. The velvet sofas in the first and second-class carriages on the Beijing-Shanghai line have been newly upholstered. Long tables have also been installed between the two seats, where tea can be brewed and meals can be eaten. The section chief said that the sleeper cars will also be renovated soon. Because of the congestion of passengers, they are trying their best to increase the number of passenger cars. Now each train has an average of fourteen cars, which is half more than before, but it is still not enough to meet the demand. The most hateful thing is that the ignorant coolies often break the glass windows of the passenger cars. Recently, there has also been the appearance of "scalpers." To prevent the generation of black market tickets, the police department has stepped up its prevention. The station can catch several every day. Under all kinds of restrictions, the railway facilities are still constantly being improved.

### Remembering Dr. John Calvin Ferguson: Please Restore the Original Road Name

American Dr. John Calvin Ferguson served China's education, culture, and industry for 57 years, and made many contributions. After the Pacific War, he was arrested by the enemy for assisting in the war of resistance. After being exchanged for expatriates and returning to the United States, he eventually succumbed to illness and passed away in New York. His friends Wang Genzhong, Xi Yushu, Xu Peixian, Biao Weiyu, etc., believe that Dr. Ferguson made contributions to China, and have jointly written a letter to the Municipal Government of this city, requesting that Ferguson Road, which was renamed by the enemy and puppets, be restored to its original name to commemorate him, and that a memorial service be held on a regular basis. The original letter stated: "Dr. Ferguson personally founded Nanjing University and taught at Jiaotong University (formerly Nanyang Public School) in this city, nurturing talents and producing outstanding individuals, who have now become the backbone of various undertakings in our country. After the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, he devoted himself to his duties and spared no effort. During the War of Resistance, Dr. Ferguson was filled with righteous indignation and provided even more assistance to our war of resistance. Because of this, he was resented by the enemy and was arrested after the Pacific War. After being exchanged for expatriates and released, he returned to his homeland, but eventually passed away due to his advanced age and inability to withstand the hardships. Now that victory has come and the country is being rebuilt, the state is promoting the recognition of loyal and heroic individuals to encourage future generations. Dr. Ferguson, as an ally, resided in this land for a total of 57 years. Throughout his life, he embodied the spirit of impartiality and service, and eliminated the prejudices of strength and weakness. All that he did benefited our country and our people. The principle of honoring virtue and repaying merit leaves no exceptions. We initiate a memorial service to express our admiration. We also propose to restore the original name of Ferguson Road in this city, which was renamed by the enemy and puppets, so that it may be remembered forever."

### Luo Xuelian, Representative of the Central Propaganda Department, Discusses the Mission of the Film Service Center, Explaining External Rumors

Recently, there have been rumors about the Central Film Service Center established by the Central Propaganda Department and the department's dispatch of personnel to the recovered areas to take over the film industry institutions of the enemy and puppets. According to Luo Xuelian, the representative of the Central Propaganda Department stationed in Shanghai, the establishment of the Central Film Service Center is aimed at rationally distributing films, using the profits to support film production, and avoiding manipulation by film merchants. Its organization and business have been approved by the Central Government. The center has been established for more than two years and was not established in Shanghai after the war, nor is it privately operated. Its scheduling of films for theaters and its agency distribution of Chinese and foreign films are based on mutual agreement and contract execution.

There is absolutely no coercion. The service fees charged by the center are only for theaters or film holders who have a contractual relationship with it, and the fees are much lower than those of ordinary commercial operators. Like ordinary public institutions, it charges handling fees for film screenings by various institutions, groups, factories, and schools due to actual needs (originally 1,000 yuan per screening, recently changed to 2,000 yuan) to cover the cost of equipment. There is absolutely no charge for screening domestic newsreels or newsreels borrowed free of charge from the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union. If the applying unit requests to designate a certain film for screening, it must sublet it from the film holder. Therefore, there are charges of tens of thousands of yuan (the highest is no more than 50,000 yuan). This charge includes film rental, equipment consumption fees, and transportation and meal expenses for equipment handlers and staff. The applying unit is provided with a triplicate receipt issued by the Central Government, and the film holder also receives a formal receipt. All expenses are audited by the Central Government. The center was originally a wartime organization and achieved great results in the rear. Whether it will be abolished or reorganized in the future will depend on the needs. This time, the Central Propaganda Department sent personnel to various recovered areas to take over the cultural institutions operated by the enemy and puppets, including film, but all were handled in accordance with the "Provisional Measures for the Management of Newspapers, News Agencies, Film, and Broadcasting Industries in Recovered Areas" approved and promulgated by the Central Standing Committee. The center is not responsible for the takeover, but only temporarily takes over the relevant business after the takeover, which is also temporary. All takeover work is temporarily used after the takeover in order to cooperate with the post war reconstruction work in the recovered areas, which has also been approved by the Central Government. The technical personnel and low-level employees in various film theaters and film studios who were originally working under the control of the enemy and puppets are temporarily retained for work reasons, and the number is minimal, just as the personnel of agencies or factories who handle handover during the surrender of the Japanese army are retained for business needs to prevent work from being interrupted. As for Shanghai-produced films, in accordance with the regulations of the Central Government, all films produced in Shanghai before the outbreak of the Pacific War that do not violate the current film censorship standards can be publicly screened throughout the country after being reviewed and approved by the Central Drama and Film Censorship Institute. Changing the film title is, of course, the right of the film holder. Those produced under the control of the enemy and puppets after the outbreak of the Pacific War are all recognized as puppet films, and are absolutely prohibited from screening. After the victory of the War of Resistance, the center only handled applications for review of domestic films in the interior. As for acting as an agent for distribution, there was only Mr. Fei Mu's "Hong Xuanjiao." In addition, it did not act as an agent for any domestic films, let alone puppet films. The Central Government has always intended to support the film industry and make it cooperate with the promotion of national policy. If there are any inadequacies in the handling, we sincerely hope that the pioneers of the cultural world will provide guidance with a proactive attitude. If there are any illegal acts by the handlers, we also hope that they can provide evidence with a responsible attitude and sue the competent authorities.

### Securities Exchange Preparing to Resume Business

Since the order to handle the affairs of the China Securities Exchange, the matter of preparing to resume business is currently under careful discussion and planning. However, important facilities must be handled in accordance with the relevant authorities, and resolved by the council of the exchange. Regarding the number of brokers, there are currently no regulations. However, it is heard that the qualifications for future brokers, their regulations, and their review will be very strict. It is also heard that the preparation for the exchange's resumption of business is unlikely to be realized in the near future.

### Rogernikov Released

[United Press, This City] The U.S. Army Headquarters in the China Theater announced today that former Russian boxer Rogernikov, who was previously suspected of war crimes against U.S. military personnel and investigated by the U.S. Army authorities, has been released after swearing an oath, as there was no concrete evidence.

### Weather Forecast

The center of the Siberian anticyclone is stable in North China, and the tropical air mass is encroaching on this area. The low pressure center in Jiangxi is advancing slowly to the northeast east.

Weather forecast: The Yellow Sea will be clear and cold, turning cloudy, with haze, wind direction uncertain, wind force moderate. This area will be clear to cloudy, mild turning cold, with fog in the morning, wind force light to moderate. The East China Sea will be overcast, wind direction uncertain, wind force moderate. There will be morning fog along the coast of China. Temperature on the 24th: maximum 63.9 degrees, minimum 43.9 degrees.

### Rascal Demands Year-End Bonus, Chops Eleven Times, Both Person and Dog Injured

[Report from this newspaper] Wang Peifeng, 45 years old, of No. 8, Lane 2, Yunnan Road, formerly Lao Guo of the Maritime Tour Guide Agency, had several rascals come to his residence around 11:20 AM yesterday to demand a year-end bonus from the former Tour Guide Agency. When they disagreed, they brandished a kitchen knife and stabbed him in the head four times. At that time, Wang's house had a hunting dog, which bit the rascals, and was also hit in the head with seven chops. Afterwards, they fled in a rush. The injured person was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment, and the injured dog was sent to the Asian Veterinary Hospital for diagnosis.

Commercial News

### Gold Market Sentiment Slightly Affected, Futures Fall 14,000, US Dollars and Hong Kong Notes Slightly Decline

The gold market was slightly affected yesterday because the market in the wartime capital was down, and because of news reports that the authorities' ban on gold as collateral for loans would be temporarily suspended. The opening in the morning retreated to 923,000. Overnight floats were closed one after another, so it went downstream from 926,000, retreating to 907,000 at one point, and then stabilized slightly, hovering around 915,000 until noon. Later trading was even more scarce. Overnight delivery once called as high as 922,000, but it did not last, and finally hovered within 915,000. As a result, spot delivery rose slightly by 9,000 compared to the previous close, and overnight delivery fell by 14,000. Gold jewelry was listed at 98,000, refined silver at 800 yuan, and silver dollars at 480 yuan. There were still more sellers, the buying price was 470 yuan, and the under-the-table interest rate still stood at 10 to 13 cents.

Foreign currency U.S. dollars were still suppressed by physical goods. Since 1,475 yuan, supply continuously exceeded demand, and the arbitrage price always fluctuated around 625 yuan. Gradually affected by the gold market, the price fell to below 1,460 yuan, struggling around 1,465 yuan at noon, and still hovered at the original price in the afternoon. As a result, it fell by 17 yuan compared to the previous close. Hong Kong notes fell because overseas remittances concentrated in Hong Kong, and the local legal tender in Hong Kong tended to rise. Old notes fell by 5 yuan, while new notes fell by 2 yuan due to unfavorable news about new notes in Chinese and Western newspapers, causing a trend of selling.

### Major Investors Lack Support, Chinese Stocks Trend Downward, Foreign Stocks Also Retreat in Unison

Chinese stocks continued to hover, and sentiment was not as excited as in the previous days. Although the opening in the morning was similar to the previous close, it did not advance but retreated, causing many parties to close. Although major investors were cautious and resisted every step of the way, the general trend finally failed. Wing On Yarn fell from 1,640 yuan to 1,540 yuan, and Mayar retreated from 1,130 yuan to 1,040 yuan. Among the "three small" popular stocks, except for New Shanghai, which was assisted by major investors and rose from 73 yuan to around 80 yuan, low-priced major investors and banks slightly increased their holdings, and at noon, it was slightly agitated. As a result, Wing On Yarn and Mayar each fell by more than 50 yuan compared to the previous close, Xinhe fell by 30 yuan, Jingfu fell by 4 yuan, Qinxing fell by 2.5 yuan, New Shanghai was flat, China Textile fell by 30 yuan, Wing On fell by 50 yuan, and various unpopular stocks also deteriorated again.

Those in the foreign stock industry were even more cautious. Trading was quiet, and customers, in view of the unfavorable news, did not dare to intervene in activities. Trading unfolded under extreme secrecy, and Jardine stocks felt unsustainable and retreated. The afternoon close resulted in Jardine Yarn falling by 150 yuan, and Jardine Brewery and Steel each falling by 100 yuan, Jardine Matheson fell by 50 yuan, and British American Tobacco also fell by 150. The asking price for Hutchison Whampoa Paper slightly retreated, but the selling price did not change.

### Bond Market Dull, Narrow Premium, Little Change

The public debt gradually stabilized after falling. Type C opened flat in the morning, fell to 1,450 yuan after opening, and then began to stabilize, but supply and demand were scattered, so it rebounded to 1,585 yuan. The premium was narrow, and major investors did not want to engage in more activities. All of it was left to retail investors to settle on their own, and the process had no special changes. Miscellaneous brands had little stimulation, and as a result, Type C and Type E rose slightly due to their popularity, while Type A and Type B fell slightly.

### Construction Company Continues to Sell, Yarn Sales Do Not Diminish

Yesterday, the yarn market continued to trend upward. Transactions from mainland merchants came from a source, and the Changzhou cloth factory was particularly keen to purchase 20s and 32s raw materials, so the price increased by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. The Construction Company continued to offer a large amount of goods, but sentiment was not discouraged by this, because there is still hope for sales to expand.

### Artificial Silk Has Ups and Downs, Factory Business Has No Major Changes

Yesterday, the artificial silk market had mixed ups and downs. Filament and 75 semi-gloss were relatively lifeless, but 150 was in greater demand than supply, and the price was the most stable. 120 Tiantiao opened at 1.1 million yuan and closed at 1.15 million yuan. The afternoon was similar. The lowest price for Qian Yuan was 710,000 yuan, and then it rose to 760,000 yuan, which was 40,000 yuan less than the previous day. Trading was very quiet. The general market for factory business had no changes. Others were slightly higher by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Some people were pulling up the price of the transfer of goods Da Cheng Ge Bi crepe, with the highest price being 2,550 yuan per yard, and then 2,470 yuan. The American Mayar brocade and Minsheng brocade still followed the original market from the previous day.

### Cotton Cloth Sales Active

Yesterday, cotton cloth trading picked up somewhat, and prices also improved, each rising by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Sichuan merchants and Hankou merchants, because there were ships about to set sail, were in a hurry to chase after blue cloth, shirt poplin, and Shilin spot goods, but the supply of gray cloth base was still not smooth.

### Factory Merchants Purchase Spot Cotton

Yesterday, spot cotton trading was good, mostly by Chinese merchants. It was estimated that 42s raw material American cotton high-grade middling flower price was 65,000 yuan, and second-grade price was 58,000 yuan. 32s raw material Da Zhong Ji price was 75,000 yuan. 20s raw material Qidong Sanyuzhen flower price was 65,000 yuan, and Tongzhou flower price was 57,500 yuan. The above were all factory prices. 16s raw material Huoji seed flower sold for 8,000 yuan, and the price was more stable than the previous day. No goods were heard to have arrived at the dock.

### Rice Market Continues to Be Weak

The rice market was sluggish because the amount of rice accumulated in the north and south markets was strong, about two or three hundred ships, and the market was dull. It was also heard that old Saigon rice was being sold, which made sentiment extremely soft and caused a unanimous decline. Northern japonica rice fell by 300 to 400 yuan, early thin rice fell by more than 500 yuan, and indica rice also fell by 400 to 500 yuan. Although white glutinous rice has demand due to the approaching New Year, the arrival was quite strong, so it fell by 500 to 600 yuan, and Yin Yuan’s middle and lower levels fell sharply by 600 to 700 yuan. Flour has been stopped in other places and is ending the year-end accounts. The local street is still quiet, and the price has also fallen by 200 to 300 yuan. Post-shaped rice flour is still not optimistic. The oil market is firm, soybean cake has risen by 100 yuan, and raw beans have changed from retail to stock, rising by 100 to 200 yuan. Raw peanuts have increased sharply, but recently, there have been arrivals from Guide and Kaifeng in Henan Province, as well as Qingdao Road in Shandong Province. The wine market has strong demand due to the need for the New Year, and digestion is very strong, rising another 1,000 yuan, and the situation is still trending upward.

### Tea Prices Only Increase, Do Not Decrease

The tea market is approaching the Lunar New Year, and in addition to the sustained removal of goods by merchants, local shops also have considerable intent, and sentiment is upward. Holders are holding on, so transaction prices are only increasing and not decreasing.

### Paper Prices Vary, Will Be Flattened

The price of foreign paper is soaring, especially the price of drawing paper. Compared with the current market and before the war, there are obvious differences. White newsprint has reached 10,000 times, drawing paper 4,000 times, and kraft paper 3,000 times. The wartime market price is often not based on cost as the standard, but on sales as the basis. Now the war is over, and it is gradually entering a peacetime state. The differences in paper prices will also be flattened. Recently, the price of drawing paper has been rising the most, which has already seen this motive. The foreign price is fixed at the pre-war average, regardless of the type of paper, so it is predicted that the goods that were deserted during the war will gradually become popular, and the above-mentioned differences in multiples will naturally be adjusted.

### Stable Timber Market, Willow Oak Price Stands Out Alone

The timber market is generally quite stable, but the price of large shipments of Willow Oak is quite firm. It is said that the woodworking industry has a use for it, leading to people collecting it. Willow Oak plywood has also quietly risen in price. These two types of timber are the standard products in the timber industry, and there are people who favor them. It is rumored that Willow Oak rounds have been negotiated with foreign countries, with the price expected to be around 120 US dollars.

### Summary of Market Conditions

Bananas and Guangdong sugarcane oranges, unseen for many years, have been shipped in large quantities since the resumption of navigation between Shanghai and Hong Kong after the victory. Yesterday, the British ship "Ysheng" arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong, bringing another large batch of 6,500 cases of bananas, 1,200 cases of sugarcane, and 400 cases of oranges. The Xin Ruian ship returned to Shanghai from Fujian, carrying more than 300 boxes of longan.

The transaction of chemical raw materials was sparse throughout the day. Both buyers and sellers adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Caustic soda had some buyers at low prices, and the price appeared to be stabilizing.

The transaction of knitted goods was relatively active yesterday, but the focus was all on summer goods, such as undershirts and socks, and the price was higher than the previous day.

### New Trends in Social Education After the War: Eradicating Illiteracy and Reorganizing Mass Education, Social Education Institutions Providing Remedial Education Concurrently, Capital to Establish Tutoring Schools

[Special Dispatch from Chongqing] Social education is for the purpose of eradicating illiteracy. The adult out-of-school schools that were established before the war have, since the promulgation of the National Education Law in the 29th year of the Republic, reformed adult out-of-school education by establishing adult departments in national schools.

National Schools

Each county establishes a central national school in the townships and towns, and each Bao establishes a national school in the township. The above two types of national schools are divided into two departments, one for children and one for adults. Adult out-of-school mass education is attached to the national schools, and all social education institutions are further engaged in advanced remedial education for the masses, from higher elementary to junior high, senior high, and specialized vocational training, with agricultural, industrial, and commercial subjects.

Tutoring Schools

In the capital area, tutoring schools and branches have long been established in Chongqing and rural villages, and schools attached to factories, totaling about 20 classes, with about 2,000 students. During the post-war education recovery, the Ministry of Education plans to establish this tutoring school in the capital to promote it, and is in the process of planning. However, the results of the national schools running adult mass education for several years have been slow in various provinces and cities, and many have not met the standards.

Mass Schools

Now that the work of education recovery in the recovered areas is widely open, in the future, in addition to using broadcast education and electrical education, it is still planned to supervise various social education institutions to set up mass schools, and to promote them in various ways, in order to eradicate illiteracy as soon as possible. It is also heard that the mass school textbooks used before the war have been revised for a long time, and are divided into adult class textbooks and women's class textbooks, totaling eight volumes, which will be printed and distributed by the designated bookstore United Public Printing Office.

### Education Vice Minister Hang Liwu Talks About the National Provisional University Student Unrest

[Central News Agency News] Hang Liwu, the Permanent Vice Minister of Education, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing a few days ago. Yesterday, he told reporters that the incident of students at the Nanjing Provisional University insulting Director Wang Shulin has come to an end. The professors once went on strike, but have continued to teach at the request of the majority of students who wanted to resume classes. As for the students who caused the trouble, they are now being handled by the court. The outcome is a judicial matter, and we cannot interfere. Hang continued, "In addition to establishing the Shanghai branch of the Sino-British Cultural Association, this trip will also inspect the National Provisional University tutoring classes and other schools."

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] It is heard that the detained students who caused trouble at the National Provisional University are on a hunger strike this morning.

### Universities in Wuhan and Guangzhou to Set Up Remedial Classes

[Dahua News Agency, Nanjing] In order to rectify schools in the recovered areas and improve the standard of education, the Ministry of Education has successively established provisional university tutoring classes in Nanjing, Shanghai, Jifu, Beiping and other places, to accommodate students from various universities in the recovered areas and give them remedial opportunities, so that they can transfer to formal universities in the future and obtain legal academic qualifications. Recently, the ministry, considering that many students in Wuhan and Guangzhou have not been able to enjoy this preferential treatment, has specifically dispatched personnel to investigate the situation in the two places within a few days and set them up accordingly.

### National Central University Relocation Expenses Approved at 200 Million Yuan, Chengdu Medical College to Join the Eastward Move

[Dahua News Agency, Chongqing and Hangzhou News] The National Central University Rehabilitation Committee has gradually started its work, and the heads of the five groups have also been selected. Professor Zhang Geng is in charge of the investigation group, Professor Kong Lianggui is in charge of the transportation group, the engineering group has not yet been determined, Hong Fanwu is in charge of the finance group, and Director Yang is in charge of the general affairs group. However, the school recently received a telegram from the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs, intending to borrow the Nanjing school buildings for six months, which made the students quite uneasy. Therefore, the Nanjing school buildings have not been completely taken over, and a part of them has been borrowed by the Provisional University. Most of the buildings need to be repaired, and furniture and desks need to be replaced. If the school buildings are completely borrowed, the school relocation this summer will become a problem. Moreover, the school had only more than 1,000 students before, and now it has increased to more than 5,000. Even if all the existing school buildings are taken over, they will not be enough. Therefore, the school has requested the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to allocate 600 American mobile homes for use as student dormitories. As for the relocation expenses, which are quite huge, the Ministry of Education has previously requested to allocate 600 million yuan, but now 200 million yuan has been approved. It is feared that adding new school buildings will not be enough. It is also heard that the Chengdu Medical College of the school will move to Chongqing at the end of April after the end of April, and then move eastward together. Another saying is that after the Longhai Railway is open, they will first take a car to Baoji, and then transfer to a train to Beijing.

The development should be average. The ratio of high school, teacher training, and high vocational schools should be 2:1:1, and the ratio of junior high, simplified teacher training, and junior vocational schools should be 6:3:1. Junior secondary schools in each county should be universal and distributed, so that one-third to one-half of the graduates of the central national schools can be accommodated for further studies. Women's education should be promoted in secondary schools, and there should be a considerable proportion of male and female students. Secondary education should pay special attention to science education to meet the needs of the times. The province should be divided into several secondary school districts, so that the secondary schools in each county in each district can enroll students, and research and improvement matters can be carried out in a unified manner. The funding for secondary education should be provided in addition to the government's budget to meet actual needs.

### The Bomber Basketball Team Defeats the American Wildcats, While Donghua Loses to Sierra

Starting at 7:00 PM yesterday, the Bomber basketball team organized by the Second Battalion of the Mechanized Unit of the National Army, in its first battle to conquer Shanghai, met the US Navy Wildcats. The scene on the side of Shaanxi Road was extremely grand.

The Bomber team and the Wildcats started fighting, and both sides used brute force to fight hard. In the first half, the Bomber team led 16 to 13. In the second half, the Bomber team was able to take flexibility from rigidity, while the Wildcats only used brute force. Therefore, the Bomber team finally won with a score of 30 to 23. The Bomber team's basketball skills are quite impressive. It is a pity that they will be leaving Shanghai tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, which is a great regret.

In the battle between Sierra and Donghua, the Sierra team took the lead with taller players. In the first half, Sierra had an absolute advantage with a score of 35 to 17. As a result, Sierra won a great victory over Donghua with a score of 75 to 41.

### A Glimpse of the Southwest Associated University (Part 1)

— Shen Shi

The Southwest Associated University, a joint product of Peking, Tsinghua, and Nankai Universities during the Anti-Japanese War, stood tall in the Southwest for eight years, fulfilling its unique mission and its due responsibility. It persevered through repeated evacuations and endured numerous intense bombings, remaining steadfast and never ceasing its scholarly pursuits. Thorns and bitterness forged a brilliant, tear-stained history. It tells people how difficult it is to maintain an existing order, and how even more arduous it is to establish a new one. It tells people that firm faith and dauntless perseverance are necessary to establish wartime education and preserve the lifeblood of culture. Its struggles and creations earned concern from home and abroad and won unanimous praise from the nation. Countless young men and women braved blockades, traversed enemy lines, and threw themselves into this free haven, learning and researching to their hearts' content. We quietly listen to the solemn school anthem: "Ten thousand miles of the Long March, bidding farewell to the palaces of the Five Ridges, temporarily resting our feet on Mount Heng and the Xiang River, only to bid farewell again." The lingering sorrow and boundless grief of "playing the reed pipes and reciting scriptures in the mountain city, our feelings so earnest" are so captivating and inspiring. "Waiting to eradicate the enemy, restore the capital, and return to Yan and Zhao," filled with hope and faith for the future of the nation. Now that the Anti-Japanese War is won, I gaze at the clouds in the northern sky and contemplate the waters and mountains of the Southwest. I cannot help but report for the elders, brothers, and sisters who have suffered for many years under the iron heel, the arduous management of this prestigious institution in the Southwest, and the romantic stories of its years.

The Union of the Associated University

At the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, Peking, Tsinghua, and Nankai Universities formed a temporary university in the Sacred Heart College outside Xiaowumen in Changsha. Due to the intensifying war situation, the temporary university decided to move to Kunming. Some faculty and friends went to Kunming via the Hong Kong coast. Some students, under the diligent and kind leadership of Professor Zeng Zhaolun, trekked along the newly built Southwest Highway and arrived in Kunming on foot. They borrowed the buildings of Kunhua Agricultural School to continue classes. The Changsha Temporary University was renamed the Southwest Associated University and a teachers' college was added. The new buildings outside the Great West Gate were completed, and the university's main body, including the colleges of liberal arts, law, and science, moved into the new buildings. The engineering college was located on Tuodong Road in the east of the city.

The Associated University replaced the president with a standing committee of three members, filled by the presidents of the three universities. Mr. Zhang Boling was old and rarely came to the university. Mr. Mei Yiqi usually presided over all internal matters, while Mr. Jiang Menglin was responsible for all external affairs. Thanks to the three members of the standing committee, their mutual trust and consultation, and their mutual tolerance and support, the huge Associated University was able to "unite and merge." There was no personal bias, no disagreement. Thousands of faculty and students sang, danced, and pursued truth and created new life and a new academic style in harmony.

Although the standing committee was the highest administrative body of the school and made decisions on school affairs, the majority of decisions were made by the faculty meeting, which was composed of representatives elected by the professors. The faculty meeting is truly worthy of praise and admiration. Due to their high degree of democratic style, they overcame numerous difficulties. Due to their noble character and profound knowledge, they were entrusted with the mission of inheriting the tradition of freedom and creating a new culture. They harmonized the school with the local authorities, ensured the wholehearted support and sincere obedience of thousands of students, and further promoted the "unity and merger" of the academic styles and spirits of the three schools.

The faculty and friends of the Associated University came from overseas and from every corner of the country, speaking different dialects. However, at gatherings, even if their Mandarin was clumsy, they had to speak it. Although their lifestyles were different, they showed special affection and kindness in their joint research and study in pursuit of truth, which invisibly enhanced the "unity and merger." The Associated University has occupied a glorious page in the history of education for the past eight years. Its development proves that the cultivation of a good academic style requires a consistent high degree of freedom and democratic spirit, and that political stability lies in tolerance, openness, and pragmatism. In other words, only democracy can usher in a new life for politics.

Typical Professors

Although the Associated University was located in remote Kunming, it faced numerous external obstacles. Thanks to the painstaking efforts of Mr. Mei and Mr. Jiang, it was able to stand tall. However, the true strength that sustained the school was the virtuous and respected professors. They were morally noble, sincere, and enthusiastic, teaching tirelessly and influencing people with virtue. They had profound knowledge and devoted all their energy to inspiring and exploring in the classroom, in the laboratory, and in field explorations. Despite the shockingly high prices, they lived simple lives and were content with poverty, which naturally won the respect of their students. The poet Wen Yiduo, in addition to teaching at Kunhua Middle School, also had to engrave seals to supplement his family's income. Mr. Yuan Fuli, who ventured alone into the sparsely populated areas of the Greater Liang Mountains, had a particularly large number of children. His books and belongings had long been sold, and he could only eat two bowls of thin porridge a day. The dignified old philosopher Jin Yuelin, after returning from lecturing in the United States, lived in the same house with Mr. Qian Duansheng. Because they couldn't afford a servant, he even had to help Mrs. Qian chop pine firewood. At one philosophy conference held in Kunming, Mr. Jin lamented in a humorous and pained tone that there were few people in the country studying Western philosophy, and that the funding for the philosophy conference was particularly short, which paled in comparison to the funding for the engineering society. But only heaven knew the contributions of the two to mankind. The upright and outspoken political commentator Zhang Xiruo, since publishing the sensational article "Specialization of Hebei and Chahar is Not Allowed" in "Independent Review," remained silent in the school despite speaking several times in the National Political Council. He encouraged students to enrich themselves and write less wall newspapers. He was once beaten by a landlord's adjutant, and the students all felt indignant for him. It is said that Mr. Zhang has not been silent in recent years. For the future of the country, he fully expressed his sense of justice. When he lectured, the classrooms were packed, and the windows were full of people. His articles were snatched up and eagerly read by everyone. Mr. Lei Haizong, who was proficient in Chinese and Western history, was amiable and kind. He once fainted on the road due to anemia. His wife worked as a small staff member at Yunnan University to support the family. The famous biologist Chen Zhen spent all day in the laboratory, becoming intimate with the microscope. He had the spirit and patience of Pasteur. I wish him success in science. The Buddhist authority, Professor Tang Yongtong, with his silver hair, spent his days studying Buddhism and rarely gave public lectures. But whenever he stepped onto the podium, the classroom was always filled with people. What is even more worthy of mention is Mr. Chen Yinque, the master of philosophy, history, and literature, whom Mr. Wu Yusan most admired. He wore a round melon-shaped hat, closed his eyes, and sat upright lecturing, his tone so soft that the people sitting below listened attentively. Mr. Wu Mi, Mr. Shen Youding, Mr. Liu Wendian, and others all went to listen to his profound theories, mentioning him to everyone and praising him. Originally, Mr. Chen was awarded an honorary chair at Oxford University before the war, but because of his weakness, he could not go and had to stay in Kunming. When Kunming suffered a heavy bombing, Mr. Chen could not run and went to teach at the University of Hong Kong. When Hong Kong fell, the enemy, awed by Mr. Chen's reputation and scholarship, sent him flour, which Mr. Chen refused to accept even to death. The enemy could do nothing. Mr. Chen later escaped and moved to Jialing. When Guilin was lost, he fled to Chengdu. When the war ended, Mr. Chen flew to England to lecture. I heard that when he passed through Kunming, he still had deep sorrow and grief. The spirit of the Associated University lies in these things. The professors were willing to protect the truth with their lives and sacrifice themselves for the truth when necessary.

Wallace's Ten Reviews

They loved the country and hoped that the country would be strong and catch up with the times. They loved the school and strived to make the school great. Their consistent goal was to protect the traditional free lecturing and free research, the beautiful academic style, and to pursue the bright truth of justice. If the truth and the free academic style suffered misfortune, they would not hesitate to defend it with their lives. This made the Associated University shine brightly, attracting students from afar to travel thousands of mountains and rivers to seek refuge in this free land of scholarship. When fascism spread across Europe and the Far East, former U.S. Vice President Henry Wallace came to China and delivered a moving speech at the Associated University, praising the Associated University as "the only democratic fortress remaining in East Asia." Undoubtedly, this was the glory of the Associated University, but it was not proud of it. It hoped that democratic politics would be popularized in all countries, so that the world would have true peace, true prosperity, and mankind would have true happiness.

Spring and Autumn

### Playing the Lute to a Cow

— Song Shouchang

"Playing the lute to a cow" was originally a metaphor for talking about profound principles to a foolish person. Although this metaphor is meaningless, it is very worthwhile to savor. Originally, music is not necessarily something that humans can understand. Other animals with hearing organs can also feel music. Darwin said in his "The Descent of Man": "The origin of the art of music is something that males use to attract females." His reasoning is that most male animals use their voices during the breeding season. When they call, on the one hand, they are venting their emotions, and on the other hand, they are attracting the attention of females. It can be seen that if the females cannot feel the music of the males' singing or calling, how can they be attracted?

In the "Shangshu Shundian" chapter, there are also words about music moving beasts: "The emperor said: Man, I order you to promote music, teach your children, be straightforward and gentle, broad and stern, firm and without emptiness, and call without arrogance. Poetry expresses intention, singing prolongs words, sound relies on prolongation, rhythm harmonizes sound, entering the sound overcomes all, without competing for the same kind, gods and men harmonize with each other. In short: When I strike the stone and play the stone, all beasts dance." It seems that this musician is a bit boastful of his skills, but when we look at modern circuses, the performances of those four-legged beasts seem to make it possible for beasts to dance. The success of this kind of training still relies on the effect of music, using the speed and slowness of the rhythm of the music, and the high and low tones to suggest their various movements. All performances follow the guidance of the music. Advances and retreats, rises and falls are all in time. The most ferocious tigers and lions are tamed like cats, and even the clumsiest elephants seem to have spirituality. This is all due to the power of music, which makes beasts resonate with the music.

Music has a kind of assimilation effect, because the changes in the pitch and intensity of the sound are related to physiology, and the speed is based on physiological elements, so listening to music can be affected and assimilated with it. For example, the speed of the beat is based on our pulse, so we feel comfortable with the stimulation of music. At the same time, when listening to music, we must be spiritually and physically affected by the suggestion of the sound in order to truly enjoy the beauty of music. For example, hearing the sound of a trumpet gives a feeling of soaring high, because the sound of a trumpet can make people's limbs expand; hearing the sound of a drum creates a feeling of tension and excitement, because the sound of a drum can make people enthusiastic. The relationship between the feeling of music and our spirit and body is like this, so it can be applied to the training of the movements of four-legged beasts. From Darwin's reasoning and this fact, we can see that some animals can indeed feel music, but their rationality is not as good as humans. Then, their ability to listen to music is naturally lower than that of humans. The music they can feel is only loud and rhythmically straightforward.

### Textual Research on Ling Tingkan's Poems on Opera (Part 2)

— Zhao Jingshen

Oblique words and delicate phrases in the Yuan opera, how endless are the vulgar jokes and base acts. Shiqu is still the writing of a literati, unable to understand the actor Li Liweng.

Although Wu Bing (Shiqu) has many oblique words and delicate phrases, he is not unworthy of being a literati's writing. In Li Yu (Liweng)'s ten operas, all kinds of nasty words can be said, simply like an actor. From these few words, it can be seen that Ling does not like Li Yu, even more than Wu Bing.

Lou Dong labored to transform Wu Yu, Liang Fu's new sound is not as good as jade.

Who yearns for the stone drums of Qiyang, the world strives to imitate the calligraphy for exchanging geese.

During the Jiajing period, Wei Liangfu of Dongguan, Taicang (Lou Dong) improved Kunqu, making it extremely melodious, "The number of fast and slow, high and low, clear and turbid, all follow the original palace, taking words between the teeth and lips, repeatedly changing and skillfully picking, often using depth and remoteness to help its sadness," Because of his success, it is like Wang Xizhi's calligraphy that can exchange geese; therefore, everyone followed the trend, and the Haiyan Yiyang and other tunes of that time were defeated, and no one yearned for the stone drums carved by Shi Zhou during the time of King Xuan of Zhou. Everyone used Kunqu to sing legends and zaju operas.

A single word of contemplation is not easy to settle, the layers of meaning here are difficult for people to understand.

Try to create a new and different zaju opera, do not treat it as a poem or ci poem.

"Contemplating a single word, twisting off several whiskers." Although it is a genuine zaju opera, looking at it after it is written, it seems effortless; I am afraid that it also took a lot of effort in production to have this natural result, right? It is successful to put in effort and not be seen by others. Opera has a separate meaning from poetry and ci poems: this point is what Ling pays great attention to.

The language and energy must be authentic, it is different and new compared to poetry.

Extract the gold-like sentences of Jin Zhi,

Shake off the black spirit in the wind.

The original note says: "Shaking off the black spirit, scattering the yellow whiskers, Kang Jinzhi's Black Whirlwind carrying thorns is exactly the tune," Calling spirit black is indeed very novel. According to this, these two sentences are seen in Kang Jinzhi's "Li Da of Liangshanbo Carrying Thorns" in the second act.

Half a window of bright moon, the fifth watch wind.

Tianbao fragrant words, the sentences are pretentious.

What is the matter with the beautiful ending of five-character verses?

Do not teach to move to the late Tang dynasty.

The original note says: "Wang Bocheng's Tianbao Anecdotes; Half a window of a thousand miles of moon, a pillow of the fifth watch wind: like a poem of a late Tang person, it is not similar to the opera ending." I have compiled more than fifty sets of "Tianbao Anecdotes" from Yongxi Yuefu, Jiugong Dachengpu Beici Guangzhengpu, Beigong Ciji, etc. These two sentences are seen in Yongxi Yuefu Volume Four Dian Jiangchun Suite, entitled "Emperor Ming's Lamenting Ye Jing", the first sentence is "The world is clear". This song also says that poetry, ci poetry, and opera each have their own boundaries, and cannot be mixed.

The previous tune was not originally this last section.

Who taught the north and south to be transmitted in the same way?

If you compare the sheng and reed instruments to the stringed instruments,

Dongjia's good ci poem is ultimately in vain.

Ling is a worshiper of northern opera, so this song says that the north is superior to the south. If the numbers of tunes are the same, then below the second tune, southern opera is called the previous tune, and northern opera is called the last section. Southern opera's instruments use sheng and reed instruments, but northern opera's instruments use stringed instruments. No matter how good Gao Ming (Dongjia)'s southern opera Pipa Ji is, it is not as good as the northern opera. There is an essay on northern and southern opera in the Xiaolitang Wenji, but I have not been able to read it carefully in a hurry.

How many people read the harmonizing sound production manual?

Xu and Shen diverged on the discussion of north and south.

Bai Jie's cloud section is completely indistinguishable,

It is said to be widely transmitted in Yu Shi and Ning An.

Xu Yu's Shi has a northern opera manual, but I have not seen it. I have only seen the Jiugong Zhengshi, which seems to be related to Xu Yu's Shi, but this is a southern opera manual. Shen Jing (Ning An)'s southern Jiugong Thirteen Tune Manual has a stone print version from Peking University, which is easier to obtain. Shen Jing has written Yixia Ji (Sixty Kinds of Opera Books), Boxiao Ji (Three Kinds of Legends), Maijian Ji (Beijing Library Edition), and Taofu Ji (Fine Copy Edition), paying close attention to Bai Jie's cloud section. Saying that he is gaining fame in vain seems inappropriate.

Jikong used the three sounds to arrange the southern sound,

Sao Yin and Wu Sao also have feelings.

Furthermore, meticulously arranging the opera comments,

Envy him, Yu Lansheng of the East Sea.

This song has no deep meaning, it just points out some opera selections and opera reviews: Ling Chucheng (i.e., Jikong Guan Zhuren)'s "Southern Sound Three Sounds", Sao Yinsheng's "Wu Sao Compilation", and Lu Tiancheng (Yu Lansheng) of the East Sea's "Opera Comments". Could Sao Yinsheng be another name for Zhang Xuchu? Because the "Author's Occasional Comments" at the beginning of "Wu Sao Compilation" can be said to be completely the same as Sao Yinsheng's "Heng Qu Qing Tan" in the supplemented Qu Yuan Shang.

The five sounds of clear and turbid are difficult to distinguish,

Go up and down, Yin and Yang, examine diligently.

The rhyme was established by Liu Kun that day,

Zhou Lang was annoyed by Shen Xiuwen.

The original note says: "Zhou Tingzhai's Zhongyuan Yin Yun also mistakenly took Guang Yun as Shen Yun." According to this, "Guang Yun" was compiled by Lu Fayan of the Sui Dynasty. Sun Mian of the Tang Dynasty revised it into "Tang Yun", and Chen Pengnian and Qiu Yong of the Song Dynasty revised it into "Great Song Restored Guang Yun".

### Tears

— Jing Chen

The night is desolate. Facing the boundless loneliness, I suddenly remembered Verlaine's words: "When I think of the past, I want to cry." Silently asking myself: Did I ever have a past that I could cry about? How many times have I wept silently like a ghost in the past?

Alas—these are some unspeakable facts that are chewing on my fragile soul!

In this vast world, is there anyone willing to understand me? I have walked the edge of people's hearts, but I cannot find the source of life. Where is the spring?

"Keep fighting, why must people understand you?" Yes, this kind of glory belongs to those who have perseverance, but I weep for this.

I am not cold, and I do not lack the flames of love. I still have a passionate and pure heart. I am willing to dedicate all of these to one person. However, who will sincerely accept it? To whom shall I dedicate all my love?

"Being able to experience sorrow, this life is also happy." If there is such a thing, I am willing to dry my tears.

But, tears! Flow freely!

If the warmth of spring is lost, will it come again? I remember Mr. Ba Nan Yoxi once said: "Spring will come! There are countless beautiful springs." Is that really so? Could it be that what comes will be more than what is lost?

I am like a saintly virgin, who does not expect the warmth of love. However, when spring touches her heart several times, when she yearns for that beautiful temptation and cannot help but reach out to embrace it, hope quietly slips away, leaving her with eternal solitude. Oh, that unbearable solitude! Her young, fragile heart is crying.

Tears are not necessarily a sign of weakness, because strong people shed strong tears. "Tears will make me stronger," tears also bring the power to fight. The weak fall down with tears, while the strong stand up with tears.

"Wipe away your tears, even if it is painful, you must endure it, because this is not the time to cry."

The days of fighting have come, so wipe them away.

### A Happy Encounter with Lu Mang on the Sea in the Twelfth Lunar Month of Yiyou

— Xu Junwu

At the end of the year, the fragrant streets are in a blur. Meeting each other, holding hands, is so sudden. The heroes of the renaissance share three cups of wine. The remaining affair of writing is like a rainbow of ten thousand feet. I can't bear to talk about saving the poor and competing with vigorous pens. Gradually seeing the wandering official lose his lonely trace. Tomorrow, cut off half of the Song River for you. To sing a song about Dong Yue.

### Meeting Junwu Again and Invited to a Drink in a Restaurant on the Sea, Composed on the Spot

— Lu Mang

The first among poets of lakes and seas, his life is full of heroic righteousness and autumnal spirit. The reputation of his family is heavy in the land of orchids. The articles of pearl and jade are respected by the scholars of the country. How can unicorns and phoenixes perch on thorny bushes? It is good to be romantic with unicorns and phoenixes. Your ability must be cherished in the bright era. Learn from Zhang Heng's "Four Sorrows".

### Recommendation of the "Yu Kai Collection of New Year Card Exhibition"

— Wen Zhaotong

If we acknowledge that the scope of art is not limited to calligraphy, painting, and music, then the collection and preservation of items with artistic interest is also a kind of artistic activity.

As for the subtle stamps of various countries and dynasties, they can not only be used to observe the evolution of the history, economy, and politics of various countries and times, but also each stamp can express the artistic style of a country and an era in terms of color and pattern. Therefore, we must not regard the collection of stamps as a way of playing with antiques or a job of finding popular bases, but simply as a kind of artistic activity.

Yu Kai's collection of international New Year's cards and postcards has reached 80,000 pieces, which is amazing in terms of quantity alone. Moreover, here we can appreciate the differences in aesthetic concepts between the East and the West, the great differences in artistic forms, the classical taste, the modern style, and so on. All of this is simply a sign of the development of art in China and abroad, ancient and modern. In the eyes of the appreciator, it must not be regarded as a meaningless accumulation of New Year's cards or postcards, because this is a kind of artistic activity.

Art is not necessarily calligraphy, painting, or music. In our living surroundings, there are many works of art that can be discovered, organized, appreciated, and researched. Yu Kai is an artistic worker walking on this "road station". Friends who love art should pay attention to this exhibition of his international New Year's card postcards.

### The Lute Player

— Bi Xichang

As the moon rises at dusk, I idly lean against the railing of a small building's corner. The "ding dong, ding dong" sounds of a stringed instrument gradually approach from afar, the weak tones slowly growing stronger, piercing my ethereal spirit. A shadowy figure quietly appears on the desolate street. It is a frail old man, embracing a seven-stringed lute, leisurely and freely playing melodies that no one appreciates. The desolate music seems to be pouring out his own adrift life and the vicissitudes of the world...

He slowly walks under the street lamp, the dim and powerless light ultimately unable to conceal his haggard face.

White hair flutters at his temples, and wrinkles cover his face; this must be the price of youth, this must be the record given by the era.

I linger and ponder, adding to my boundless melancholy.

The desolate sound of the lute does not pause for me and finally fades into the darkness.

Only the lingering sound deeply grips my heartstrings.

Ah! Lute player, on this vast land, where can you find your soulmate?

Spring and Autumn Annals

### The "Atomic Age"

— Xie Dongping

Human wisdom has deeply etched a mark in time: now is the age of the atom.

Only the Japanese have experienced the power of the atomic bomb. Afterwards, where will that thing, atomic energy, ultimately be used: to enhance human culture, or to destroy it? No one can provide assurance.

Now, we must thank the atomic bomb, thank the courage and great wisdom of those who invented and applied it. Its light use at least caused the enemy's unconditional surrender to be advanced by a year. How many lives could this have saved, how much material could this have spared?

Some say that China is now facing a time when the pen and the gun are contending. A member participating in the Political Consultative Conference said: "In history, when the pen and the gun contend, the pen always wins." This is perhaps because people are ultimately people, they have wisdom and reason, and can be self-aware. If people were cats and dogs, then when the pen and the gun contend, the pen would certainly be defeated. The pen's victory is assured, but in order to advance the victory, in order to reduce the sacrifices and consumption of the "contention", I advocate that those who use the pen also make use of atomic energy. If the "pen" represents light and truth, and the gun represents darkness and evil, then why can't we use atomic bombs to attack darkness and evil?

The era of "cold shots" on the battlefield has passed; the era in the literary world of sneaking around, vaguely hinting, and casting veiled allusions, without daring to write openly, has also passed.

How can you eliminate the corrupt officials, the great traitors and evil-doers in society, and the bad habits inside and out of thousands of years of bad tradition without using atomic bombs?

In the atomic age, atomic bombs must be used. This is a matter of course.

### Doubly Blessed (9) (4)

— Zhao Qingge

After struggling through a life-or-death ordeal, Mrs. Mo has now safely recovered her tranquility. She snuggles the little baby close to her side, feeling a special warmth. For four years, her life has been so dull that she has often felt bored. She has long needed a new child to fill a part of the emptiness in her heart! Especially she hopes to have a daughter. Now everything is fine, and she is completely satisfied that her wish has come true!

Mrs. Weng the Second is busy arranging the baby's diapers and clothes. Mrs. Mo feels very sorry and gratefully says to her:

"You should rest, my good sister! Be careful not to exhaust yourself; it's not convenient for you either!"

"It's alright, sister! I still have a long time to go!" Mrs. Weng the Second said, her face blushing.

Mrs. Weng the Second was indeed pregnant, because this was her first pregnancy, so she only let Mrs. Mo know and didn't even tell Mr. Weng. But eventually she couldn't hide it from Mr. Weng, who had seen it long ago.

Mrs. Mo saw that Mrs. Weng the Second was a little shy and asked her:

"Doesn't Mr. Weng know yet? Tell him quickly, tell him, so he can take care of you."

"Take care of me?" Mrs. Weng the Second said with a cold laugh, "He's busy enough taking care of his opium all day long, how can he have time to take care of me?"

"Hey! Men are all the same! Our old master here only knows how to drink all day long! Didn't you see, we've been busy here for most of the day, and we haven't even seen a ghost of a lamp yet!"

Just as she said this, Bao Ling burst in. He had already heard them grumbling about Old Master Mo again, so he deliberately interrupted their conversation.

"Mom! Let me see my little sister!" Bao Ling said, throwing himself on the baby and shouting innocently, "Little sister! Little sister!"

"Don't scare her, Bao Ling!" Mrs. Mo said. "Go and pour a cup of tea for your dad!"

"Dad? Dad is outside! He also came to see little sister!" Bao Ling deliberately interrupted.

"You little rascal! I told you to pour a cup of tea for your godfather, why don't you understand!" Mrs. Mo scolded.

In fact, Bao Ling had understood. The child was naughty, he had already understood that the "dad" Mrs. Mo was referring to was not Old Master Mo, he was just intentionally denying this term and pretending not to understand. It was Mrs. Mo who didn't understand his intention. Now that Mrs. Mo was forced to add the word "god", Bao Ling was finally convinced. So he smiled victoriously and said to Mrs. Weng the Second:

"Godfather, please wait a moment, I'll go and make you some tea."

After Bao Ling left, Mrs. Weng the Second said with a smile:

"Bao Ling is growing more and more like his father! Not only does he look like him, but even his spirit is like him."

"That's why I don't like Bao Ling very much! Who knows, I hate that dead old man so much."
