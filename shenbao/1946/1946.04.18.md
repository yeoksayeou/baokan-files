### Encountering Strong Winds, Flying for Nine Hours: Marshall Arrives in Beiping from Tokyo, President Chiang and Wife Await Meeting in Chongqing

[United Press Beiping, 17th] Special Envoy Marshall and his wife arrived in Beiping at 6:35 PM on the 17th, flying from Tokyo. The journey took nine hours. The large, four-engine transport plane, which originated from Washington, took a total of four days to reach China. Mr. Marshall was greeted at the Xiyuan Airport in Beiping by representative Gillem, U.S. member of the Military Mediation Department Robertson, and several important officials from both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. Mr. Marshall, looking slightly fatigued after the long journey, immediately drove to the U.S. Embassy upon disembarking. Discussions regarding the tense situation in China are expected. It is anticipated that Mr. Marshall will continue his flight to the provisional capital on the 18th, accompanied by Gillem. During the flight from Tokyo to Beiping, Mr. Marshall's plane encountered strong winds, delaying the flight by four hours. Special Envoy Marshall returned to the U.S. on the 11th of last month to report on his duties. His direct flight here today to first consult with the Military Mediation Executive Headquarters and then proceed to Chongqing is of great significance.

[United Press Chongqing, 17th] Special Envoy Marshall returned to China today, flying directly to Beiping to hear a direct report from Representative Gillem regarding the situation in the Northeast. The Kuomintang and Communist representatives of the military three-person group returned to Chongqing this afternoon, indicating little progress in resolving the war in the Northeast. Leaders in the provisional capital are speculating on what instructions Mr. Marshall is carrying after his discussions in Washington. Most observers anticipate that Mr. Marshall is carrying strict demands: (1) a ceasefire in the Northeast, and (2) a peaceful resolution to the political dispute. According to observers, fulfilling the above demands is necessary if China hopes to continue receiving active assistance from the United States in resolving its problems.

[U.S. Information Service Beiping, 17th] Qin Decun (Chen Cheng's representative) and Luo Ruiqing (Zhou Enlai's representative) flew back to Chongqing this morning with their staff. Lieutenant General Gillem will remain in Beiping and return to Chongqing with Marshal at the same time.

[United Press Nanjing, 17th] Propaganda Minister Wu Guozhen notified the Nanjing office of his department today that his originally scheduled arrival in Nanjing from the provisional capital on the 20th has been changed to the 24th. This is because he is accompanying President Chiang to Nanjing, and the President will not be able to depart on the 20th. Whether the 24th is feasible will depend on the outcome of President Chiang's discussions with Special Envoy Marshall.

[United Press Chongqing, 17th] Madame Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Mei-ling, flew back to the provisional capital from Shanghai this afternoon. President Chiang personally went to the airport to greet her. Madame Chiang's return is likely to prepare for welcoming Mrs. Marshall in the provisional capital.

[United Press Washington, 16th] The U.S. is about to issue a declaration regarding the renewed civil war in China. According to Secretary of State Byrnes, Special Envoy Marshall will report on the situation in China in the near future, at which point the U.S. government will make a statement. However, the details of the statement were not disclosed.

### Large Parts of the City Occupied by Communist Troops, Nationalist Troops Fight Fiercely in Changchun, Morale Boosted by Airdrops Yesterday

[Our Newspaper Beiping, 17th] Du Yuming is scheduled to fly to Shenyang on the 18th to direct military affairs. Mr. Du bid farewell to the Beiping press at 4:00 PM on the 17th. It is reported that Liang Huasheng has gone to Sipingjie to command, while Zheng Dongguo has gone to Changtu for inspection.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 17th] According to a certain military expert, the disparity in numbers between the Nationalist and Communist forces north of Shenyang is significant. Furthermore, the Nationalist troops must consider the suffering of the people of the Northeast in every action, leading to a difficult situation for some outstanding young soldiers who are defending the sovereignty of the Northeast. Currently, the Nationalist troops do not intend to use paratroopers to reinforce Changchun. It is also heard that the vanguard of the New First Army was only one day's journey from Changchun yesterday. After urgent repairs, the Beining Railway was barely passable yesterday.

[Our Newspaper Beiping, 16th] Communist troops attacking Changchun have penetrated deep into various parts of the city. The security forces and other government personnel defending Changchun are concentrated in one corner, struggling to resist. This is according to this morning's report. Additionally, Nationalist troops advancing north passed Sipingjie and this morning advanced to a point 100 kilometers from Changchun. If the defenders of Changchun can hold out for three days, the Nationalist troops should arrive.

[Central News Agency Changchun, 17th, 11:00 AM] The defending troops of Changchun have been fighting fiercely for twelve hours. Most of the city area has fallen into the hands of the Communist troops. Although our troops are short of ammunition, their morale remains high. Airdrops received on the 17th boosted morale. It is estimated that the Communist troops attacking Changchun have been continuously reinforced and now outnumber our forces by tenfold, and their firepower is significantly superior. Confirmed news: Nationalist troops advancing north crossed Sipingjie on the 15th and are advancing at full speed.

[United Press Changchun, 16th] Nationalist troops lost the only train station in Changchun today. The Yamato Hotel, located 200 yards from the train station and managed by the Soviets, can no longer be contacted by telephone. According to the last message sent by Major Riggs and Sergeant Ponte, who reside in the Yamato Hotel, a bullet passed through their room, but neither was injured. Currently, the Changchun Mayor's residence is under gunfire, where five American journalists reside. Yesterday, Soviet planes flew low over Changchun, but did not land at the Communist-held airfield.

[United Press Chongqing, 17th] Propaganda Minister Wu Guozhen stated to reporters on the 17th that the civil war will not spread beyond the Northeast. The CCP only needs to abide by the ceasefire and other agreements. The CCP's attack on Changchun is inappropriate from any point of view. The Nationalist troops stationed in Changchun, consisting of 2,000 regular troops and 2,000 security forces, are being pressed by over 30,000 Communist troops, and their defense area has clearly shrunk. Nationalist troops advanced north after recovering Sipingjie on the 15th of this month. Wu denied the rumor that the government intended to use transport planes carrying officials to Nanjing to transport large numbers of fresh troops to Changchun. It is understood that the three airfields in Changchun have fallen into the hands of the Communist troops, making it impossible to airlift reinforcements.

[Central News Agency Shenyang, 16th] Nationalist troops continue to advance north beyond Sipingjie. The Communist Party's newspaper, Xinhua Daily, published inaccurate news that "government troops suffered severe blows from the so-called 'Northeast Democratic Allied Army' in the Benxi area and north of Changtu, and that Zheng Mingxin, deputy commander of the 52nd Army, and Liu Shimou, commander of the 25th Division, were killed, and Long Tianwu, commander of the 14th Division, was injured." Military authorities dismissed this with a smile.

[United Press Tianjin, 17th] According to Nationalist military sources today, Communist forces are besieging the Shanhaiguan area. The headquarters of the 94th Army stated that troops from the 5th Division have been dispatched to a village northeast of Shanhaiguan to repel the Communist forces attacking the area. It is understood that on April 12th, a regiment of Nationalist engineering troops was surrounded northeast of Shanhaiguan. It is reported that Communist forces are attacking an area 20 miles northeast of Shanhaiguan. Nationalist military sources say that roughly nine miles of railway southwest of that location are in the hands of Communist forces. It is also known that several hundred Communist soldiers were attacking a small village 30 miles northeast of Tangshan a few days ago, but were forced to retreat after Nationalist reinforcements arrived. Other reports also stated that two regiments of Communist troops were operating within a few miles northwest of Tangshan.

### Government Representatives and Various Parties Continued to Reorganize the Government Yesterday; No Agreement Reached in Special Meeting

[United Press Chongqing, 17th] Government representatives met with representatives from the Communist Party and the Democratic League last night but failed to reach any agreement. The primary reason was the critical situation in the Northeast. The special meeting, convened by President Chiang, was said to be a final effort to complete the final reorganization of the government before April 20th. Attendees included Communist representative Zhou Enlai and Democratic League leader Luo Longji. The outcome of the meeting has not been announced. However, according to Luo Longji, the Democratic League will refuse to join the coalition government unless the Kuomintang accepts the following four demands: (1) The civil war should be stopped immediately. (2) The Democratic League must know in advance who will be the Premier of the new government and what his policies will be. (3) President Chiang's promise of China's "Four Freedoms" must be implemented. (4) The Communist Party should have ten seats on the National Government Committee, and the Democratic League should have four, so that the representatives of the two parties united together can ensure a veto power in the meeting. As of now, the government has proposed eight seats for the Communist Party and four for the Democratic League. Luo also said: "We have tried our best to compromise, and General Marshall may be able to assist. However, the government is still rapidly transporting troops and supplies to the Northeast, intensifying the war." He continued: Government representatives insist that the Three-Person Group must resolve the ceasefire issue, but the Democratic League will not join the new government while the civil war continues.

[United Press Chongqing, 17th] Government representatives held talks with representatives of the Youth Party today, hoping to reach an agreement on political issues such as government reorganization, but no detailed information was released other than that little progress had been made. Propaganda Minister Wu Guozhen said: He knows that the Comprehensive Subcommittee has reached an agreement in principle on the difficult issue of drafting a constitution and hopes that the provisions will be written down. Wu believes that a compromise has been reached, but since there may still be disputes in the future, he did not disclose the details. It is understood that the Kuomintang has decided to limit the number of Communist seats on the National Government Committee to eight.

### Results of Japanese General Election Approved by MacArthur; A Dispute During the Four-Power Control Council Meeting; Clear Response to Soviet Accusations

[Tokyo, 17th Special Dispatch from the Central News Agency] MacArthur has approved the results of this Japanese general election. Therefore, Ichiro Hatoyama, leader of the victorious Liberal Party, will become the first Prime Minister of a democratic Japan. MacArthur's representative read MacArthur's statement at this morning's Four-Power Control Council meeting, opening the way for the long-standing political deadlock in Japan to be broken. However, this statement has been met with some frustration, especially among Allied reporters. These Allied reporters have severely criticized Hatoyama due to his past political history.

[Tokyo, 17th Dispatch from the United Press] At today's meeting of the Control Council for Japan, Whitney, an official from MacArthur's headquarters, sharply responded to Soviet representative Derevyanko's questions regarding the effectiveness of MacArthur's headquarters' purge orders. It was stated that the Japanese government has been quite prompt in complying with various purge orders and occupation policies, and that all information regarding the implementation of the purge orders can be provided to the Soviet Union. The Soviet accusation that certain undesirable elements in Japan have not been removed merely copied recent reports in Soviet newspapers. Since the Soviet representative or other representatives of the Control Council have not sought this information from MacArthur's headquarters, they are unaware of the extent to which Japan has implemented the purge orders. The Soviet criticism that the normal progress of democracy in Japan has been hindered is also outdated since it occurred before the election results were announced. If Derevyanko could carefully observe the Japanese people's participation in the election, he would not make such hasty judgments. However, it is still a long way off before Japan can complete its democratic politics, but they should be trusted to have this intention. In conclusion, the election on the 10th of this month was a democratic expression, proving that the Japanese people are neither left-leaning nor right-leaning, and the United Nations' occupation policy can be trusted in this regard.

[Tokyo, 16th Special Dispatch from the Central News Agency] Another fifteen representatives from our country dispatched to the Allied Council for Japan arrived here last night. There were already twenty-seven personnel from our country dispatched to the Allied Council for Japan a few days ago.

### Receiving a Special Correspondent from the Newspaper, Shidehara Discusses Sino-Japanese Relations; Past Mistakes Were Made by Japanese Militarists; Praises President Chiang's Magnanimity

[Tokyo, 17th Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] This newspaper's special correspondent "visited" Prime Minister Shidehara at his residence yesterday for an hour. The reporter asked if he would submit his resignation after the general election, and Shidehara replied that he had not yet decided. The reporter then asked if there would be changes in the cabinet, and Shidehara replied that this matter would have to be decided by MacArthur. Regarding the general election, Shidehara provided the following detailed account: I went to a polling place not far from my residence and saw enthusiastic and orderly participants, including women. I was very interested in this. The reporter then inquired about the anti-Shidehara government movement of the crowd last Sunday. He said that the participants were not demonstrators, but rather a rabble. The reporter immediately retorted, "There were as many as 70,000 people at the scene at the time. Are they all a rabble?" Shidehara originally listened, remaining silent, only offering a bitter smile with a look that was neither crying nor laughing.

The reporter asked about the future of Sino-Japanese relations. Shidehara said that China and Japan must move forward hand in hand. This policy was advocated by himself fifteen years ago, but there were many obstacles at the time, so it was not successful. Most of these obstacles were created by Japanese soldiers, but some were also caused by the Chinese government. For example, when he was Prime Minister, he sent a special envoy to China, but he was rejected. In addition, the Chinese government failed to quickly resolve the incidents that occurred in Manchuria. At that time, a Japanese military officer who had been permitted by the Chinese government to conduct an investigation in Manchuria was suddenly killed, creating tension between the two countries. Japanese people held a rally to oppose his pro-China policy. At that time, he discussed the tense situation between the two countries with Wang Rongshi, the Chinese minister to Japan. The reporter asked if the Manchurian Incident was created by Japanese militarists. Sun Yuan did not answer, only saying that in any case, China and Japan must cooperate closely in the future.

Shidehara also said that after Japan surrendered, Chinese President Chiang Kai-shek delivered a speech that deeply moved him. That speech not only secured the safety of Japanese residents in China, but also gave them extremely friendly treatment. This is the greatness of China. The Sino-Japanese relationship is sincere and pleasant, and the future is limitless. President Chiang's magnanimity is inspiring.

### Welcoming Marshal Marshall Back to His Post

Marshal Marshall, the special envoy to China of U.S. President Truman, returned to his country to report on his duties last month. On the 12th, he and his wife flew from the American capital to return to his post in China, arriving in Beiping the day before yesterday. This high-ranking five-star marshal, despite his advanced age, has tirelessly traveled between China and the United States, dedicating himself to strengthening Sino-American relations and maintaining world peace. The Chinese people have boundless respect and admiration for him. Since Marshall's arrival, in the short period of three months, he has made indelible contributions to China's unity and peace. Now, upon his return, the current situation is vastly different from when Marshall returned home last time. Although the Soviet troops in the Northeast have withdrawn from Shenyang and Changchun, the small number of National troops stationed in Changchun to take over the area have been fiercely attacked by the so-called Communist troops, and the fighting is intensifying. Some of the Communist troops have even invaded the urban area. In the domestic political atmosphere, the harmony since the Political Consultative Conference has been overshadowed by resentment and ambition. The Communist Party's newspaper has even publicly insulted the president and slandered the government, displaying an arrogant and overbearing attitude. All of this is enough to render Marshal Marshall's efforts futile. As Marshal Marshall returns to China, we would like to briefly discuss the current situation in China, to express our sincere welcome.

First of all, we must say that the interests of China and the United States are completely the same. Because the interests of the two countries are the same, Marshal Marshall's efforts are not only respected by the American people, but also by the Chinese people. China needs peace and unity, and the traditional American policy towards China also supports a China with complete territorial sovereignty. The United States' policy is in line with the demands of the Chinese people. Since the 1911 Revolution, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of the Republic of China, intended to follow the advanced democracies of Europe and the United States and implement democratic governance. However, Yuan Shikai usurped power, followed by the division of the country by warlords and local forces, which led to a setback in the great cause of democratic nation-building. In order to complete the national revolution and establish a unified and strong democratic China, the Chinese Kuomintang launched the Northern Expedition based on the Three Principles of the People, and the country was finally unified. Just as the National Government was devoting itself to nation-building, Japanese warlords intensified their aggression, eventually leading to the full-scale War of Resistance against Japan triggered by the Lugouqiao Incident. The Chinese Kuomintang is the party that created the Republic of China. China, under the rule of the Kuomintang and under the wise leadership of Chairman Chiang, completed the task of full-scale resistance against Japan and achieved victory. The Three Principles of the People advocated by the Chinese Kuomintang have been unanimously accepted by other political parties as the highest guiding principle for nation-building. The spirit of the Three Principles of the People is to adopt the essence of Western civilization and democratic politics and reconcile it with our country's inherent traditions. The new China of the Three Principles of the People will dedicate itself to world peace and create a splendid new culture for mankind. This represents the general intention of the Chinese people and will surely resonate with the American allies across the Pacific Ocean.

Therefore, the Kuomintang will undoubtedly do more for China's unity and peace and China's democratic politics, judging from past history and future trends. Although the Kuomintang's recent actions may not be satisfactory in every aspect, we cannot deny that the Kuomintang's rule is still a stabilizing force. In particular, we cannot deny that the Kuomintang's ideals are closest to the democratic politics of Western Europe, including the United States. Although not all Chinese people support the Kuomintang, they are convinced that only under the Kuomintang's rule can they enjoy some basic freedoms. Therefore, we generally have this understanding of the current situation in China: no matter how many political parties there are in the future, the Kuomintang must still bear the responsibility of leadership. Therefore, all efforts to seek peaceful reunification of China can only be achieved by strengthening the current National Government. The more one tries to elevate the position of other political parties and weaken the power of the National Government, the more one will run counter to the expectation of peaceful reunification. As a result, the strong, unified, and democratic China expected by President Truman will be delayed and unable to be realized due to the Communist Party's deliberate attempt to seize power and its arrogant and overbearing behavior.

We need not point out here the position and ambitions of the Chinese Communist Party. The Communist Party has consistent characteristics all over the world, and those who are aware of the situation will naturally know it. Their current arrogance in China is due to the Kuomintang's step-by-step concession and tolerance for the sake of the country, but most of it is due to the support of external forces. Today's situation in China seems serious again, but this situation is actually created by the Chinese Communist Party. The Chinese people are very grateful for the efforts of the allies for the unity and peace of China, but we cannot but frankly point out that the support for the Communist Party's forces will inevitably cause regrettable consequences in the future and even at present. This is neither the general wish of the Chinese people, nor will it affect the national policy of the allies, and it will give the world's lasting peace future irremediable disasters. At this time, we have to sincerely say a few honest words.

Marshal Marshall's mission in China is difficult. This mission may be more difficult than the one he had during his tenure as Chief of Staff. This time he returns to his post, but the current situation has deteriorated so much that we feel a little embarrassed to see this elderly and respected five-star marshal again. However, with the marshal's talent and wisdom, we believe that there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome. We remember that when Marshal Marshall came to China as the special envoy of the President of the United States last time, we hoped that his relationship with China would be like that of General Lafayette with the marshal's country back then. Undoubtedly, the current situation in China and even the international situation cannot be compared with the situation at that time, but Marshal Marshall is shouldering a more important mission, which is related to the future of all mankind and the entire world. We wish the marshal and his wife a safe journey and wish the marshal's mission a success.

### U.S. Technical Intelligence Office Discovers New Secret German Inventions; American Industry Will Adopt Them

[Reuters, Berlin, 17th] The "U.S. Frontline Technical Intelligence Office" is engaged in investigating secret scientific inventions in Germany, and its discoveries are of great value. For example: (1) Magnetic recorder, which uses gelatinous wire with special magnetic iron oxide. Its characteristics are that it is extremely light, and one mile of this special wire weighs only one pound, while steel wire weighs 55 pounds; (2) High-voltage power transmission method, which can transmit electricity to a place 600 miles away from the power source, which is twice as far as the ordinary method, and can be used for teleprinters and transmitters; (3) Wireless image transmission method, which uses underground wires for long-distance image transmission; (4) Automatically controlled storage battery; (5) Color film shooting method, which only uses one film instead of three films. Germans also have invented long-distance photography technology that can shoot the situation on the opposite shore across the English Channel, and the printed images are extremely clear; (6) Extracting Acetylene from gas, which is a secret manufacturing method of the Faben Chemical Factory. In addition, German inventions include artificial rubber that is similar to Nylon, new-type bakelite, artificial fuel and lubricating oil, and new-type alloys. In aviation, the German Party has been working hard to research aircraft engines with hard carbon power. During the test, an artificial wind chamber with a speed of more than 5,000 miles per hour was used. The Germans also invented a diesel engine that is extremely light, extremely fast, and uses air to reduce heat. The 6,000-horsepower diesel engine used by its navy is far more effective than that used by the United States. The U.S. Frontline Technical Intelligence Office has discovered many new scientific inventions, and American industry will soon adopt them one by one.

### First Public Trial After Transfer of a Large Number of Major Traitors; Mai Jingming Seeks Leniency; Participated in Puppet Organization Due to Relationship with Classmate Chen Junhui; Admits to Serving as Puppet Bureau Chief; Surrendered to Military Agency After Victory

[Our Newspaper] One of the large number of major traitors recently transferred to the High Prosecutor's Office by military agencies and prosecuted after investigation, Mai Jingming, was publicly tried by the High Court yesterday morning. At 9:00 a.m., Judge Cao Jun and the clerk took their seats. The defendant was wearing a coffee-colored woolen gown and black woolen felt shoes, with a calm attitude. He was escorted to the court by two bailiffs. Judge Cao first asked the defendant's age and origin, and the answer was: 41 years old, from Taishan, Guangdong. He then asked about his education and his experience in participating in puppet positions. He answered: After graduating from Lingnan University in Guangzhou, he went to various universities in Canada and the United States to study political economy. After returning to China in the 23rd year of the Republic of China, he first served as an editor at Haitong News Agency, and later as a reporter for the English Great American Evening Post and a correspondent for a Canadian newspaper in Shanghai. At the end of the 29th year, due to his friendship with Chen Junhui, the secretary-general of the puppet National Economic Commission, he served as a member of the Economic Committee of the puppet Central Political Committee. Chen Junhui served as the director of the committee himself. However, the committee never held meetings or worked. He did not receive a salary, but only received a monthly vehicle allowance of 490 puppet currency. His job was only to verbally report Shanghai's economic trends when meeting with Chen. This continued until the end of June of the 32nd year, when he transferred to be the Director of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau of the puppet regime, which was under the jurisdiction of the puppet Ministry of Construction. At that time, it was managed by the enemy's military, and Japanese personnel were retained. After the puppet government took over, the Japanese personnel left. After I took this position, most of the personnel were not changed, and old personnel were still used. Later, because Chen Junhui became the Minister of the puppet Ministry of Industry, he transferred to be the Director of the Commodity Inspection Bureau of the puppet regime. The job of the bureau was originally to inspect exported raw silk and cotton. However, when he took office, the Pacific War had already begun, exports were suspended, and there was nothing to do, so the bureau only had more than ten employees. At that time, the director was on duty, and the monthly salary was 600 puppet currency. The expenses were drawn from the puppet Ministry of Industry. He served in this position for eight months. From June of the 33rd year, he was transferred to be the Director of the Insurance Supervision Bureau of the puppet regime, which was still under the jurisdiction of the puppet Ministry of Industry. The job of the bureau was to review insurance companies and restrict indiscriminate establishment. This is the general experience. However, it must be stated that during his tenure as the Director of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau of the puppet regime, he resumed the exchange between the rear area and the occupied area, making it easier for merchants and civilians. After the victory, on September 30 last year, he surrendered to the Military Statistics Bureau. According to the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Law, those who surrender can have their sentences reduced. The defendant did not hire a lawyer, and no family members were present in court to listen. The court ordered that the case be heard again another day, and the defendant was returned to custody.

The case was opened for trial yesterday, and the defendant stated in court that he was acting under orders and doing underground work. He also presented various certificates and Li Mo and other lawyers defended him. The court ordered that the case be heard again another day, and the defendant was allowed to be released on two million commercial bail without detention.

Huang Qinren and Hong Wenjiang were accused by Zhang Jimin of cooperating with the enemy during the enemy-puppet period and controlling the Shanghai fresh pork trade, thereby exploiting merchants and civilians. The defendant denied the allegations, claiming that it was a commercial operation, and hired a lawyer to defend him. The court ordered that the case be heard again another day, and the defendant was released on bail without detention.

End of Debate

In addition, four other cases were tried by the collegiate panel: (1) The case of Hu Jifang, the puppet commissioner of the fifth district of Huaihai Province and the puppet commissioner of the third district of Zhejiang Province. The defendant claimed that he was ordered to do underground work. Yesterday, Gong Xinong testified in court, and lawyer Cai Xiaobai defended him. (2) The case of Liu Qianan, the director of the Puppet Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Salt Tax Administration. The defendant hired lawyer Zhang Shuben to defend him.

(3) The owners of the aforementioned houses shall submit a list of the houses to the committee for review before April 30. (4) If the owners of the aforementioned houses actually need to live in the houses themselves, they shall be exempted from the unified lease upon approval by the committee. (5) If the owners of the aforementioned houses fail to submit the list before April 30, or fail to sign a lease agreement with the Central Trust Bureau within ten days after the committee approves the unified lease list, the committee may directly dispose of the houses and hand them over to the Central Trust Bureau to sign a sublease agreement with various agencies. (6) All houses that have been approved for lease shall be leased from May 1. The rent shall be calculated based on the rent in the 26th year of the Republic of China, multiplied by the multiple stipulated by the Shanghai Municipal Government. The rent shall be prepaid monthly by the Central Trust Bureau to the signed owner. For those who have not signed, the rent shall be temporarily kept by the Central Trust Bureau and delivered to the sub-leasing agency after the contract is signed.

Inside Room 313 of the Daxin Hotel on Guangxi Road, they strangled their roommate, Liu Shouzhang, with a scarf. They then stole a blank checkbook from Maohua Bank, a personal seal, and withdrew 5.2 million Legal Tender from the bank. Not satisfied, they then went to the home of the victim's mother-in-law, Xu Zhou, at No. 1133 Xinzha Road, and fraudulently obtained nine taels of gold. After acquiring their loot, they fled to the Central Hotel in Nanjing.

### Shanghai Telephone Traffic Volume Sometimes Exceeds New York Records; Telephone Company Hosts Reporters to Report on Operations

[Our Report] The General Manager of the Shanghai Telephone Company, Mr. Fortune, hosted reporters from the city at the company's headquarters on Fujian Road yesterday at 2:30 PM to observe various operations. The company manages the "Nine" line, and also has an information desk and time announcement service, which are very well-equipped. The work of announcing the time is mechanical and arduous. The announcers do not have listening devices and simply announce the time in Chinese and English. They are rotated by the information desk staff every five minutes. The company also has a technician training class, which is equipped with complete wiring and mechanical diagrams and practice equipment. A battery room is attached to the power generation room. In the event of a power outage by the power company, the batteries can provide power. However, the batteries are old and their effectiveness is reduced. Previously, they could last for up to two days, but now, in the event of a power outage, they can only last for two hours. In such cases, all telephones will be shut down, with service reserved for military and police agencies. The telephone company currently has over 1,000 employees, including approximately 450 operators, half of whom are female employees.

According to Mr. Fortune, in 1946, the "Nine" line was the busiest, with each line reaching 3.5 calls per hour, and the "One" line reaching 6 calls per hour, even exceeding New York records. Therefore, he earnestly hopes that citizens of the city will cooperate and conserve unnecessary telephone calls. The company is currently losing 30 million yuan per month. All the city's telephones are supplied from abroad, and the United States itself is currently short of 2 million telephones. Therefore, it seems impossible to increase the number of telephones in Shanghai within one year. The company has now decided to appropriately increase telephone charges, partly to make up for losses and partly to limit the number of calls. The price increase standard has not yet been decided and has been submitted to the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities for review and handling.

### A Good Opportunity to Solve the Urban Housing Problem: Talk by Xiao Zheng, Chairman of the Chinese Land Administration Society

[Our Report] Amid the city's housing shortage, Mr. Xiao Zheng, a leader in the Chinese land reform movement, member of the Central Standing Committee, and Chairman of the Chinese Land Administration Society, came to Shanghai for medical treatment for a stomach ailment. Our reporter made a special visit to him at the hospital to inquire about his opinions on the urban housing problem. He kindly gave the following speech:

1.  The major cities are now experiencing a widespread housing shortage. At the same time, due to various reasons, genuine real estate operators are generally suffering from the frustration of not receiving legitimate profits and the pain of not being able to manage and recover their properties. Under this contradictory phenomenon, it is a good opportunity to solve the urban housing problem!

2.  According to our land reform perspective, the first step to solve the problem should be to adjust the existing land and housing relationships. Tenants or owners of entire rental properties can request the government to purchase the property and land at an assessed value (if the currency value changes significantly in the future, the assessed value should be re-evaluated). 2. The government issues bonds through the Land Bank to purchase the property and land, and repays the principal and interest in installments over five to twenty years. The landlord can use these bonds to exchange for shares of state-owned enterprises such as railways, shipping, and industrial and mining enterprises. 3. The houses purchased by the government are then resold to the current tenants at the purchase price (only if the current tenants declare that they relinquish the right can they be sold by other methods), and they are required to pay the principal and interest to the Land Bank on a monthly basis. The term should not be longer than the payment period for the government's purchase.

3.  The results obtained by following the aforementioned methods are as follows: 1. Tenants no longer pay unreasonable rents, but instead purchase houses and land in installments over several years according to the actual price. They will inevitably cherish the houses and implement various improvements. 2. Landlords no longer suffer from collecting unreasonable rents and the inability to recover capital, but also have to pay house taxes and other taxes. Their original investment capital is recovered in one lump sum with bonds guaranteed by the national bank. As a result, they can recover the principal and interest from the Land Bank in installments. If they wish to exchange for shares of state-owned enterprises, their profits will be even greater. 3. The government does not need to increase the issuance of currency to purchase many unmanageable houses. It simply acts as an "intermediary," issuing a bond to guarantee to the landlords that they can recover the principal and interest from the national bank on an annual basis, and at the same time guaranteeing to the tenants that they only need to pay the purchase price according to this term, without any further trouble, and they will have complete ownership of the property upon expiration. This measure by the government adjusts the current social chaos. At the same time, house taxes and land taxes will have accurate basis and responsible payers. In our theory, we do not approve of collecting house taxes. 4. This three-way beneficial measure only harms the sub-landlords, who can no longer exchange illegitimate rights for gold bars. At the same time, it harms those who illegally occupy houses. They also have no right to live in houses without paying money.

4.  Can this method of adjusting the existing land and housing relationship solve the housing shortage problem? This depends on the following points:

5.  The current housing shortage is not entirely due to a lack of housing, but rather to an unreasonable and chaotic phenomenon that makes it difficult for most people to find a way to solve the housing problem. Now the government is opening up a broad avenue, taking out the large houses that are currently occupied by people or are only paying the minimum rent and formally distributing them, so that whoever can pay the normal price can live in a reasonable house. 2. As a result of this adjustment, tenants who cannot afford the price of the house will have to give up the house or a part of it, recruit people to buy the house with him, or sublet some of the houses to pay the price of the house, so that people who have no house to live in can get a house. But he does not need to pay a top fee with gold bars, and most of the housing shortage problem can be solved in this way. 3. The landlord's real estate was originally stagnant and had no market. After this method, it can be revitalized. Real estate owners, on the surface, do not receive the real estate price in cash in one lump sum, but according to the current value, it is averaged and recovered in fifteen years, and the annual income is not a small amount. (Currently, an average small house is valued at 15 million yuan, and it is averaged over 15 years, with an annual recovery of 1 million yuan, with legal interest attached. The tenant pays about 89,000 yuan per month.) Fifteen percent "purchase years," according to the usual interest rate, is also not low. The housing price recovered by the landlord can indeed be invested in new houses. If the landlord no longer invests in real estate due to the current high interest rates, real estate can fall in price due to this method. It is easier for capable people to build houses for their own use, which indirectly helps solve the housing shortage. 4. Perhaps some people doubt that no one will do the real estate business according to this method, and the housing shortage will become more serious. From the perspective of our land reform, we believe that the real estate business is not an example of encouragement at all. We want to encourage "home ownership." Therefore, we are willing to have the government run the Land Bank to lend money to people who build their own houses. We also hope that there will be "homeowner cooperatives" in the cities in the future to jointly build houses and solve common problems. We do not want a few large real estate owners to come out to build large houses to rent to the general public.

5.  What we land reformers hope for in the urban area is: "Municipal land ownership" and "home ownership." The current housing problem is the result of the irrational use of municipal land. We believe that this urban housing problem is not an accidental phenomenon, but has always existed, but it has become particularly obvious after the war. We solve the problem, do not only care about the present, only seek to make up for it, we must adhere to the basic principles and solve social problems in a practical way. Therefore, we believe that the land administration agencies in large cities should have full power to solve the housing problem and the rationalization of related taxes. At the same time, the lack of a Land Bank is indeed a major regret. If the government really wants to solve this major social problem—the land problem—the Land Bank must be established as soon as possible.

### Police Station Repeatedly Warns, Bond Market Still Active, Search Carried Out Yesterday Afternoon, More Than Seventy People Arrested

The opening price of the national bonds yesterday was around 5,250 yuan. Retail investors were active and assisted by northern speculators, which caused the price to reach a high of 5,600 yuan again. Relevant departments repeatedly notified that gatherings were not allowed. There was some profit-taking at the high, and the price struggled around 5,350 yuan at noon. Midway through the day, there were rumors of trouble, but driven by greed, operators disregarded everything. After 11:00 AM, the police station carried out a search and arrested a large number of bond market speculators by truck (70 men and 2 women). The market price then came to a halt. Based on the final price, all bonds had risen slightly compared to the previous closing price. Trading in Chinese stocks also stopped several times. Initially, the highest prices were Yong Sha at 5,180 yuan, Meiya at 4,350 yuan, and Jingfu at 435 yuan. The prices then declined. Before noon, Yong Sha retreated to 4,930 yuan, Meiya to 4,130 yuan, and Jingfu to 415 yuan, and then stabilized slightly. The noon closing prices for popular stocks such as Yong Sha showed slight declines compared to the previous closing prices. The situation for less popular stocks was stable. There were still many sellers of old stocks. The asking prices were slightly higher in the afternoon. The supply and demand for foreign stocks were balanced yesterday. There was continued profit-taking in floating stocks. The market was not doing well. Jardine Matheson traded at 22,000 yuan. People were uneasy. Ewo and British-American Tobacco struggled at the previous closing price. There was an abundance of speculative funds. When the market price stabilized, there were more buyers for popular stocks such as Ewo and British-American Tobacco. Yegong was still being absorbed by Yezhong Dayou. Asian stocks were supported by retail investors from securities firms. Therefore, the aforementioned stocks were stable near noon. The rest were just so-so. The result of the noon closing was that Ewo, British-American Tobacco, Asian stocks, and Yegong rose slightly, while the rest were flat.

### Gold Price Rises Slightly

The gold market was stable yesterday, with a mostly sideways trend. Credit was tight. There was some slight improvement midway through the day. The U.S. dollar boosted buying interest, but the general sentiment did not have high expectations for the future of the gold market. After rising, many sold off. The opening price in the morning was around 1.51 million yuan. After opening, it broke the 1.5 million yuan mark. Guang Bang absorbed a small amount. Soon after, it gradually recovered. The Central Bank's allocation was still at the original price, and there was no demand. The scope for speculation was becoming narrower. It was not easy for those with capital to lend it out. There were more buyers at lower prices. U.S. dollars were extremely tight. Before noon, it had risen back to 1.55 million yuan before leveling off. At noon, it was around 1.53 million yuan. In the afternoon, there was more profit-taking, and it declined slightly. Jewelry sales were slightly brisk. The final price was stable, rising by 10,000 yuan compared to the previous closing price. Ornamental gold was 168,000 yuan. Silver was 1,500 yuan. Silver dollars were still mediocre. The secret rate for overnight lending was even more rampant, with interest rates of only 1.2 to 1.5 cents. Those with capital still felt it difficult to find counterparties.

### U.S. Dollar Sales Plentiful

Difficulties in Large Denomination Transactions

Foreign exchange, U.S. dollars, with substandard incoming goods, were still in great demand. Demand exceeded supply. The general sentiment was that there was hope for U.S. dollars. Foreign firms were also selling gold to exchange for U.S. dollars. In addition, large denomination 100-yuan notes were not commonly used for settlement. Money changers were willing to offer a discount of 70 yuan, but there were no takers. As a result, the amount of money in circulation was extremely scarce. From an initial price of 2,000 yuan at the beginning of the morning, it gradually rose. Before noon, it reached a high price of 2,065 yuan. At noon, it hovered around 2,050 yuan. It softened slightly in the afternoon. The result was that it rose by 20 yuan compared to the previous closing price. Hong Kong dollars were flat. There was no surge of buyers. Although old goods were flat, new goods fell back by 5 yuan. Rupees were 500 yuan, and Hong Kong dollars were 400 yuan. Supply exceeded demand for both.

### Rice Prices Soar

Yesterday, the rice market soared due to sharp increases in prices in the interior and higher costs. Sellers were even more determined to sell. Sales became smoother. Indica and japonica rice prices rose uniformly by a strong 3,000 yuan. Flour also rose by 200 to 300 yuan following rice prices. Soybeans also increased by 300 to 500 yuan. Raw peanuts were secretly tight. Soybean cake rose again by 400 to 500 yuan. However, the market gradually softened at the close. Wheat bran was still stable. There was some inventory of edible oil. Attempts to raise prices were weak, with a slight increase of 1,000 yuan. All grains rose following rice prices.

### Yarn and Cotton Transactions Lackluster

The yarn market declined slightly yesterday. Northern merchants showed some interest in medium-count yarns. There was very little activity from other customers. People were not as excited as the day before. There were more sellers among the peers. Prices did not plunge due to the insufficient supply of spot goods from small factories. The average price of combed yarn was approximately 20,000 yuan. Money prices were flat. Only 32-count doubled yarn closed at 1.12 million yuan, falling by as much as 60,000 yuan. Yesterday was also the regular period for the Textile Construction Corporation to open for yarn sales. There were 28 varieties of yarn and money offered for auction. Opening prices were generally similar to the previous period. Only 42-count doubled thread was slightly lower by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. The 20-count and 16-count yarns urgently needed in the market were both absent.

Yesterday, New York American cotton was reported at 0.35 pounds per pound, equivalent to USD 27.60 for the near term and USD 27.62 for the far term. Middling spot was USD 28.11. The spot cotton market in this city was still stable, but there was not much progress in transactions. Only Shenxin No. 6 Factory imported over 200 bales of Taicang cotton. Most of the transactions were conducted among the peers. The Textile Construction Corporation has not yet purchased.

It is reported that Chaoqing sugar has been cleared, and those with complete tax documents are priced at 44,000 to 45,000 yuan, with little change.

Turmeric: Recently, due to successive arrivals from Taiwan, supply exceeds demand. Previous prices were close to 70,000 yuan, but now there are few buyers even at 40,000 yuan.

Chemical Raw Materials: Caustic soda and soda ash continue to be high. White petroleum jelly has arrived, and prices have fallen slightly, almost matching yellow petroleum jelly.

Paper: Foreign paper prices have risen slightly due to the appreciation of the U.S. dollar. Domestic rough-edged paper prices have fallen due to sales by the Minbang.

Leather: American tree-grain leather has fallen slightly. Raw sheepskin prices have fallen again and again because manufacturers' purchasing power is sluggish, resulting in oversupply. The rest are still stable. Dextel Dyestuff Company's pigment clearing office has begun to allocate pigments, and notices have been issued for shipments. The goods from the Ciba factory have also been put on the market, and transactions have been strong recently.

### Hong Kong Transshipment Certificate Goods Subject to Import Regulations

### Economic Briefs

Reuters, London, 17th: Since the news of the discovery of a huge gold mine in South Africa was published in the newspapers, the price of gold in the London free market has fallen by 25 percent, which is the worst in six weeks. The reason is that the general public has lost confidence in storing gold and has increased the purchasing power of gold pounds and paper money.

The French Minister of Agriculture believes that it is difficult for the United States to meet the needs of European countries in the current world food shortage. Therefore, France has to change its original export plan to reduce food exports. The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce will be inaugurated in Nanjing on the 26th of this month. The Ministry of Social Affairs has ordered the Nanjing Municipal Chamber of Commerce to set up a reception office. There are a total of more than 100 representatives from the Chambers of Commerce of various cities across the country who will register starting from the 20th. The conference period is scheduled for three days.

### A Glimpse of the Security Council: China Upholds the Common Interests of the United Nations and Will Never Trail Behind the United Kingdom and the United States

— Aircrash on April 1st - Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing Reporting from the United States

On the fourth day of the United Nations Security Council meeting, the battleship "William Mary" I was on was just sailing from the French coast into New York. Everything in the New World was "new" to me, just like the new international temple of peace, unable to grasp the location of the new venue.

The Council meets at Hunter College on the outskirts of New York City. It takes more than half an hour to take the subway from 42nd Street in the city center to participate, and you have to change trains at 149th Street. Several neat buildings of Tingte College stand alone in the suburbs, and the national flags of the 51 United Nations have been moved from the roof of the London Central Building to the central lawn of Hunter College.

Security at the venue is even stricter than in London. Entry and exit require four checks. Plainclothes inspectors stand with military police, like secret police from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Miss Aggers is still the director of the conference's press department. She is one of the international press officers "transferred" from London.

Gromyko Exits the Venue

Published Large Photos

The news kingdom can be said to have issued a 100% mobilization order for this important international gathering. When the United Nations General Assembly was held in London in January, London newspapers were still only one large sheet per day, so many detailed records and wonderful descriptions were inevitably incomplete. Readers could not fully enjoy themselves either. At that time, a batch of New York newspapers were shipped from the United States to London by special plane. Although they were a bit late, everyone still scrambled to read them. This time, the meeting in New York, the American news media believed it was the best opportunity to show off photos, pictures, descriptions, and comments. Even if a needle fell on the ground at the venue, the newspapers considered it good material to record. On the day Gromyko exited the venue on Wednesday, the New York Daily News published dozens of pages of large photos, from Gromyko failing in the debate, standing up with his chest out, turning his body, taking a step, Bay纳斯 looking at him, to walking out the door, getting in the car, and the national consulate. Every movement had photos published. A large group of reporters followed Gromyko all day long, entangled until 2:00 AM. Gromyko became extremely impatient and repeatedly replied to them: "There is nothing to say, you should go back. If Moscow has telegram instructions, I will call you. Okay, please go back!" The reporters still followed him. At 2:00 AM, Gromyko could no longer bear it and said with all his might: "Why are you so stupid? I am going to sleep now." The reporters slowly dispersed. Mr. Irving Liberman, a famous foreign reporter from the New York Post, did not return home until dawn that day. The next morning, this reporter appeared at the Soviet consulate again. He wanted Gromyko to answer his questions, even if he only said one word.

Headlining the Soviet Union

Published in Large Red Letters

It has been four days since the Soviet Union stopped attending the meeting, and many reporters are still tracking Gromyko. Many newspapers still use the Soviet Union's movements as headline news. The "American News" evening paper publishes the Soviet Union's movements in large red headlines every day. The New York Afternoon Post, which has a slightly left-leaning opinion, especially uses the most systematic text to explain the ins and outs of many issues. The United States is a country where freedom of speech has reached its peak. Their opinions and current affairs commentaries are extremely objective and reasonable analyses. Village women scolding in the streets or cold sarcasm are very rare.

In rare cases, you can see a slight glimpse, for example, several publications said that the Iranian issue was "a conspiracy of a few British and American oil mine capitalists," saying that "贝纳斯's background is the investors of Iranian oil fields," and also said that "阿拉 (Iran's petition representative) himself is an Iranian oil field comprador," but such unfounded slanders are, after all, rare.

According to a staff member of the conference's press department, there are a total of more than 800 reporters from New York City and other ports and countries stationed in New York who have requested to attend the meeting. However, there are only 300 seats for reporters to listen in, so many were directly turned away, and many were only issued admission tickets without seats in the venue. The day Miss Aggers took me into the venue, I saw many American colleagues standing outside the door craning their necks, and these people belonged to the latter category.

Reporters Sit on Spring Seats

Like in a Theater

The venue itself is indeed much smaller than London's Central Building, but the actual press seats are not inferior to London. The London conference was attended by fifty-one countries, with many seats for representatives, consultants, secretaries, and attendants. This time, the Council is only attended by eleven countries, there are fewer people singing the play, and more people watching the play. I said they were "singing a play," and in fact, it was indeed like singing a play. Isn't it? The pink walls, the lights that are controlled and adjusted at any time, the suitably adjusted sound system, and even the spring seats that the reporters sit on are like in a theater. The atmosphere of the venue is sometimes serious, sometimes playful, sometimes silent, and sometimes everyone laughs together. Shakespeare said: The world is a stage, and diplomats are the main characters who directly come on stage.

For example, once they discussed requesting reports on the entire incident from the Soviet Union and Iran. 贝纳斯's original proposal was limited to 11:00 AM on April 2nd, and the Australian and Polish representatives proposed to change it to 11:00 AM on April 3rd. The French representative echoed Australia and Poland's opinion, and his supplementary reason was: Today we are discussing this issue, in New York it is March 29th, and in Moscow Eastern European time, it is already March 30th. In order to take into account the factual needs, it should be extended by one day to April 3rd. 贝纳斯 then said: The April 2nd I said is already April 3rd in Moscow Eastern European time, so it is better not to change it. The whole place burst into laughter. The bald-headed Mexican representative was very realistic and said: Even if it is April 3rd, looking at the Soviet Union's appearance, it would be good if they could send it by April 4th. The Egyptian representative also had this intention. Finally, Chairman Guo Fuchu said very solemnly: Even if it is April 3rd, the conference has decided to limit the deadline to before 11:00 AM on April 3rd. Please send the reports from both countries. Without raising hands to vote, it was formally passed.

Fighting Alone

Never Attack Head-on

After the Iranian issue arose, the only one who voted in favor of the Soviet Union was the Polish representative, Lanz. After Soviet Gromyko did not attend the Iranian issue discussion, Lanz became the situation of fighting alone. This diplomat, with a dashing appearance, natural demeanor, and often wearing a purple-black suit, is much stronger than the Polish Foreign Minister at the last London conference. He speaks very clearly and also very tactfully. He never attacks people head-on. When he disagrees with 贝尔纳斯, he always has to go around in a circle, first saying that he agrees in principle, and then saying where to amend, even amending to be completely opposite. He often looks around with a smile, and except for the Australian representative sitting next to him, very few people give him any "smile." Poland's situation is pitiful enough, so pitiful that he himself understands.

Like at the London United Nations General Assembly, the venue uses both English and French. When the meeting was held in London, the representatives of France, Belgium, Egypt, and Ukraine all spoke French. This time, except for the French representative, almost all used English. However, Chairman Guo Fuchu always very orderly ordered "translation." The Soviet and Egyptian representatives both spoke English this time, both very fluently and sonorously. Each time a representative speaks, the lights are specially "illuminated." During the translation, the lights are shone on the translation seats in the middle of the horseshoe shape.

Two New and Old US Secretaries of State

Walking in Perfect Alignment

Because of the Iranian issue, 贝纳斯's attitude was very firm this time, and he specially rushed from Washington to participate in person. He spoke clearly and calmly, unlike when he had a "sandy voice" or trembling in London. Stettinius sat next to him without saying a word. These two new and old American Secretaries of State are both masters of diplomacy. Although their styles are different, their steps and opinions are always consistent. Once, 贝纳斯 was speaking and forgot to turn on the microphone, and Stettinius quickly brought it to him. They often entered and exited the venue together, and American reporters took many "following closely" shots of the two of them.

Two Major International Events in New York

China's Honorary Chairman

At the two major international events in New York, China was honored as chairman (Security Council and International Military Staff Committee). General Shang Qiyu's principles for the meeting are the same as Mr. Guo Fuchu's. We aim to uphold the common interests of the United Nations. Therefore, no matter from which angle you look at it, China is quite respected internationally. At least, we have no special mortal enemies in today's international community. The Chinese delegation to the Security Council once hosted Chinese journalists in New York. A reporter from the Chinese Overseas Daily asked Representative Guo: Is China following behind the United Kingdom and the United States? Mr. Guo Fuchu solemnly replied to him: China upholds the common interests of the United Nations and abides by the United Nations Charter, and will never follow behind anyone.

Perhaps that reporter had prejudices on certain issues, and a good press conference ended up with everyone blushing. The next day, another New York overseas Chinese newspaper, the American Daily News, published news of the reception saying: "...A certain Xu, a reporter from the Chinese Overseas Daily, publicly slandered the National Government at the reception, causing dissatisfaction among all the reporters."

Many people are afraid to meet news reporters, and news reporters themselves should also reflect on their own conduct. Representative Guo Taiqi said with great emotion that day: "We Chinese are still like this ourselves, what else can I say?" (April 1st)

Welcoming Hall Under Construction

American soldiers are supervising German war criminals in Bremerhaven to build a welcoming hall in preparation for accommodating the families of the American occupying forces. In all US-occupied areas, women and children whose husbands or fathers are stationed there can follow them.

Miscellaneous Thoughts

### Daughterly Demeanor

— Congjun

In feudal society, being born a woman seemed to require a specific kind of demeanor. Because of the emphasis on men over women, a great disparity was created between the sexes. It was as if women were always just women, and women and men had to have differences in language, behavior, attitude, and preferences. As a result, the woman in the minds of the general public was always gentle, tender, weak, shy, silent, joyless, dignified, melancholy, and prone to illness. Originally, women in feudal society were in a subordinate position to men, lacking independent personalities. All evaluations were limited to the subjective needs of the male side, and women also had to cultivate considerate, obedient, long-suffering, and gentle personalities in this environment.

The cultivation of this unique female personality can be said to be entirely due to the social environment. Because men were in a dominant position, the women they desired would certainly possess these personalities. These personalities then manifested in demeanor, naturally leaning towards gentleness and dignity. Women in the writings of ancient scholars were all depicted as frail and melancholy, silent and taciturn. If a woman spoke freely in a large gathering, expressing her emotions to the fullest, she would surely be seen as 'brazen.' But for men, it was different. They had the right to say what they wanted and thought, and they had the right to express their feelings. The "daughterly demeanor" shaped by the traditional social environment invisibly restricted the expression of women's emotions and the articulation of their thoughts.

The forms of "daughterly demeanor" handed down from the old society were passive, morbid, decadent, and declining. What "daughterly demeanor" manifested was an artificial, unnatural attitude and manner, with voices deliberately lowered and actions made especially refined. Normal emotions could not be properly expressed, resulting in psychological abnormalities. Sometimes one had to feign illness even when healthy, and add a few coughs even without needing to cough. Lin Daiyu in Dream of the Red Chamber can be taken as a typical representative of this kind of "daughterly demeanor."

According to modern progressive thought, this kind of "daughterly demeanor" from the old society should no longer exist among new women. Our standards for judging female beauty are different from before in various ways. In the past, people thought that melancholic and sentimental women were beautiful, but modern people's views are completely different. Melancholic and sentimental women are morbid and do not meet the conditions of beauty. The most important thing for modern women is to have a healthy body and mind, be strong and robust, express emotions appropriately, adapt to life properly, have a generous attitude, natural manners, and be neither self-deprecating nor arrogant. Say what you want to say, do what you want to do. When among men, do not think of yourself as "I am a woman," and do not have the concept of "he is a man and I am a woman." Respect your independent personality, and deal with people and things with a pure heart and noble behavior.

As for the general tenderness, composure, and dignity of women, we naturally cannot completely deny them. We do not object to women loving their husbands with considerate feelings, and we do not object to women loving their children with a gentle and kind attitude. We should preserve the special and beautiful aspects of women's personalities, but we disagree with letting women suppress their emotions, unconditionally endure humiliation without resistance, and blindly obey in any situation, becoming like sheep. We oppose pretentious "womanly demeanor." We hope that the demeanor women express outwardly (of course, inner thoughts determine outer demeanor) is natural and appropriate, generous and moderate, lively and happy.

Contemporary historian Chen Hengzhe said: "Women of the new era should maintain their sexual personality on the one hand, and express their individuality on the other." Oppressed women under the grip of feudal forces lacked precisely the "individuality" that Mr. Chen mentioned. The "individuality" of women differs just as the "individuality" of men differs. The women shaped by the environment of the old society, from that kind of "daughterly demeanor," were made from a single mold, and of course, there was no "individuality" to speak of.

Society has changed, and the times have turned to a new page. We hope that the "daughterly demeanor" expressed by new women is full of a spirit of active progress and noble and beautiful individuality. It is better not to be a woman at all, otherwise, one must be able to speak and dare to speak, be able to do and dare to do, be able to laugh and dare to laugh, be able to scold and dare to scold! Women raised in glass greenhouses as playthings for men, that kind of frail "daughterly demeanor," that kind of suppressed, dare-not-speak, dare-not-do "daughterly demeanor," that kind of unreservedly accommodating men, obeying men, forgetting their own status, and only knowing how to please men all day long "daughterly demeanor," we are willing to be eliminated by the raging waves of the new era from now on!

### Sister-in-Law Song

— Baling

"Long pipe, short pouch,

I am my mother's spoiled darling,

I am my father's precious treasure,

I am my brother's dear sister.

My sister-in-law says I don't go to the fields,

How many more years can I spend at home?

My sister-in-law says I don't plant scallions,

How many more winters can I spend at home?

Take the abacus and calculate,

I have been at home for two whole years;

Take the abacus and calculate,

I have been at home for two and a half years."

This is a folk song between sisters-in-law in a large family. In this song, we can see the lack of cooperation and mutual hostility between sisters-in-law in Chinese families. Therefore, how to improve the Chinese family system? And how to reconcile the disharmonious atmosphere between sisters-in-law in large families? This is also a question worth studying and discussing.

Local Customs

### The Production Area of Hairy Bamboo Shoots

— Duyun

These days, the cheapest vegetables on the market are hairy bamboo shoots, only costing two or three hundred yuan per catty, because there are many sources. The red-husked hairy bamboo shoots eaten in Shanghai come from Hangzhou, but not many. The yellow-husked ones come from Ningbo, accounting for 70 to 80 percent of the market.

The place in Ningbo that produces the most bamboo shoots is called "Wuyan," located sixty li west of Yin County. That place is located in the Chongshan mountains, part of the Siming Mountain range, more than a thousand feet above sea level. There are more than a thousand households, with a street to sell daily necessities, catering to local needs. There is a large rock on the mountain, which can be dozens of zhang in size. Because all the crows in Yongxi go out to forage for food during the day and return to rest around this rock at night, it is called "Crow Rock." The village is mostly inhabited by people with the surnames Weng and Mao, so it is also called "Weng Rock." Within a radius of dozens of li around Wuyan, all that is planted is hairy bamboo, which can be described as "no other trees in between." Therefore, the local people use hairy bamboo to build houses, and bamboo leaves and branches for firewood. Most utensils are made of bamboo. All year round, they rely on the production of bamboo: hairy bamboo shoots in spring, whip shoots in summer and autumn, and winter bamboo shoots in winter. They also cut down hairy bamboo and carry it to Fengyu Market or Lujiapu, twenty li away, to sell, exchanging it for everything to solve their needs for clothing, food, housing, and transportation.

The hairy bamboo shoots produced there are fresher and more delicious than those from other places, originally because thousands of crows roost in the bamboo forests of Crow Rock at night, leaving droppings in the bamboo forests, increasing the fertilizer. Therefore, the local residents treat the crows very well, prohibiting shooting and capturing, treating them as their food and clothing parents!

Those who do bamboo shoot business have a station in the village, specializing in collecting hairy bamboo shoots. After collecting the bamboo shoots, they hire people to carry them to the bamboo shoot boats at Fengyu Market. The boats leave that night and arrive at Jiangxia in Ningbo the next day, then they are transported to steamships, arriving in Shanghai on the third day. Therefore, the freshest hairy bamboo shoots eaten by Shanghai people take at least three days. If the steamship is delayed, it may take five to seven days or more. The bamboo shoot vendors soak the bamboo shoots in water to prevent them from aging easily. Therefore, no matter what, Shanghai people cannot eat fresh hairy bamboo shoots.

There are good and bad years for bamboo shoots, usually every other year is a good year, but there are also intervals of two or three years.

Hairy bamboo shoots have a season. After the season, they become hairy bamboo. During the peak production period, the bamboo shoot factories buy them in large quantities to make canned bamboo shoots. Ningbo's Shengsun Factory was the first to do so.
