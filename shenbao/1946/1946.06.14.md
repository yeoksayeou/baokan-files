### Bai Rude and Others to Fly to Beiping Today and Transfer to Shenyang; Northeast Ceasefire Under Negotiation; Zhou Enlai May Make a Trip to Shenyang

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] The overall situation is developing amidst contradictions. War has ignited and intensified in the Northeast, Hebei, and Shandong, where Communist forces are active. Meanwhile, negotiations in Nanjing show signs of progress. In the past two days, Marshall has frequently visited Chairman Chiang and met with Zhou Enlai, keeping him exceptionally busy. It is reported that Marshall, during his visit to the Chairman, inquired whether there were any plans or proposals for a permanent solution after the expiration of the fifteen-day ceasefire agreement. This clearly demonstrates Marshall's desire to seize the effectiveness of the negotiations. Currently, he is pursuing two very practical and important matters: (1) assisting Xu Yongchang in discussing military issues with Zhou Enlai, and recalling Bai Rude to assist in drafting a Northeast ceasefire plan; (2) having Yu Dawei directly negotiate with Zhou Enlai on resolving the restoration of transportation issue. Observers believe that negotiations between the two sides have entered a concrete stage.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] General Bai Rude arrived in Nanjing and visited Zhou Enlai at Meiyuan New Village at 10:00 AM on the 13th to discuss matters related to the Northeast ceasefire and the dispatch of executive groups to the Northeast. It is reported that Bai Rude is scheduled to fly to the Northeast with Li Minran and Wang Shoudao on the 14th. The personnel for the Northeast Executive Division of the Military Mediation Department have been decided: the American representative is Major General Bai Rude, the government representative is General Cai Shoulian, and the Communist representative is General Rao Shushi. After this news was released tonight, a reporter visited a certain gentleman in relevant circles and inquired about the hope for a Northeast ceasefire. According to him, whether the establishment of the Northeast Executive Division of the Military Mediation Department can immediately begin work will depend on whether the Communist forces in the Northeast are willing to quickly withdraw from Lafa.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] General Bai Rude is scheduled to fly to Beiping on the 14th and then transfer to Shenyang. The return date of Colonel Hill, the head of the Transportation Management Section of the Beiping Executive Department, is yet to be determined. As of the 13th, there are only eight days left until the ceasefire deadline. Currently, war reports are frequently received from North China, causing the government to be extremely anxious and the people to be deeply worried. The Communists, however, are still employing their old trick of "fighting while talking" to confuse the people and trouble the government. News reporters run their legs off every day, but they cannot obtain any news that can comfort the people, and they all cry out in despair. This afternoon, some people heard that Zhou Enlai would revisit Ambassador Marshall, while others said that Zhou was waiting quietly for a reply from Yan'an. It is rumored that Zhou has telegraphed Yan'an about Ambassador Marshall's suggestion that the Communist forces in the Northeast withdraw from Lafa, and he is now indeed waiting for Yan'an's reply to be forwarded to Marshall. It is also rumored that there will be significant developments in the overall situation within the next three days, so that people will not have to wait in vain until the 22nd.

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 13th] Xiong Shihui, Director of the Northeast Provisional Headquarters, will travel to Nanjing within the next few days to visit Chairman Chiang and consult with various ministries and departments on all matters concerning the Northeast.

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 12th] Communist representative Rao Shushi stated to Director Du that Zhou Enlai may come to Shenyang within a day or two to discuss the Northeast ceasefire issue. Lin Biao may also make a trip to Shenyang, but this will be decided after Zhou Enlai arrives in Shenyang.

[United Press, Nanjing, 13th] Zhou Enlai stated: He did not demand the extension of the ceasefire deadline as a condition for continuing negotiations.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 13th] An authoritative source told reporters that the clarification of the Northeast military dispute will not wait until after the 15th. If the Communist forces do not withdraw from Lafa within three days, the National Army will not be able to sit idly by and watch the ceasefire order be torn up.

### Ambassador Marshall Invites Yu Dawei for a Meeting; Preliminary Agreement Reached on Restoring Transportation

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] It is reported that during the meeting between Marshall and Zhou Enlai yesterday, a preliminary agreement was reached on the restoration of transportation. This morning at 10:00 AM, Minister of Communications Yu Dawei was again invited to visit Ambassador Marshall, and Colonel Hill, the head of the Transportation Management Section of the Beiping Military Mediation Department, also participated. The meeting lasted approximately two hours, but the content has not yet been announced. According to a certain source, based on the results of the transportation talks over the past three days, although the Communists have expressed their willingness to discuss and resolve the restoration of transportation, the Communists' increasing military actions have become a major obstacle to the restoration of roads. If the Communists try to avoid the important and dwell on the trivial, intending to be perfunctory, how to ensure that the repair work will not be obstructed again during its progress must be carefully considered in advance, so as not to be ineffectual. Granting Ambassador Marshall the final arbitration power and strengthening the arbitration power of the American representatives of the Executive Department's ceasefire group and transportation group are particularly necessary. It is reported that the Ma-Yu transportation talks at noon today discussed this, and now they are waiting for Zhou Enlai's reply.

### Communist Forces Invading Lafa Continue to Attack Xiaogujiazi

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 13th] The Communist forces that invaded Lafa continued to vigorously attack the Xiaogujiazi area (six kilometers west of Lafa) on the 10th.

Furthermore, the National Army stationed on the north bank of the Songhua River was attacked by Communist forces that had sneaked in from the vicinity of Taolaizhao on the evening of the 10th. The National Army did not drive them back until the morning of the 12th.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 13th] The Communist forces attacking the vicinity of Yingchengzi, Qianhoumafengtun, and other places southeast of Haicheng from Ximucheng were repelled by the National Army on the 9th and fled back to Ximucheng. The National Army only restored its original defensive positions and did not pursue them.

### Military Mediation Department Dispatches Additional Groups to Mediate in Jiangsu and Anhui

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 13th] Due to the increasing intensity of conflicts in various regions, the Chiefs of Staff of the Government and Communist sides of the Military Mediation Department held a special meeting yesterday afternoon. Government Chief of Staff Cai proposed to quickly dispatch additional groups to Shandong for mediation, and the Communist side also proposed to dispatch three additional groups to northern Jiangsu and northern Anhui for mediation, as conflicts were particularly fierce in the northern Jiangsu and northern Anhui regions. As a result, the following was decided: (1) The 21st group, which had been recalled from Gaomi, will be dispatched to Jinan to be transferred to the conflict areas; (2) Three new groups will be dispatched to Rugao and Gaoyou in northern Jiangsu, and Dingyuan in northern Anhui. The above four groups will depart in the next few days.

At the same time, a Communist official denied today that the Communist forces had any intention of attacking Qingdao and asserted that no accidents would occur there.

[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 13th] Admiral Cooke, commander of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, returned to Shanghai this evening after consulting with various officers of the Marine Corps here.

[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 13th] Admiral Cooke, commander of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, flew here from Nanjing at 6:00 PM on the afternoon of the 12th, carrying Chairman Chiang's handwritten order to Ding Zhipan, commander of the garrison, instructing him on the defense of Qingdao. Cooke then convened a meeting of senior officers, including Major General Clement, commander of the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Qingdao, and invited Commander Ding to participate, inquiring in detail about the Communist forces' recent attacks on Qingdao City and its surrounding areas.

[United Press, Nanjing, 13th] The headquarters of Special Envoy Marshall is extremely concerned about the situation in Qingdao. Before flying to Qingdao, Admiral Cooke, commander of the U.S. Seventh Fleet and the U.S. Marine Corps in China, met with Ambassador Marshall in Nanjing.

Jianqiao Regenerates from Ashes; Aviation School to Reopen Tomorrow (Zhu Minwei from Hangzhou)

### The Flight Training Program of the Hangzhou Jianqiao Aviation School, Which Has Been Silent for Nine Years, Will Resume on June 15

After the aviation school was reorganized from the aviation class of the Central Military Academy in 1931 until the start of the full-scale War of Resistance Against Japan on August 13, 1937, it educated six classes of flying generals. The first battle in the skies over Hangzhou on August 14 was initiated by these six classes of flying generals, marking the beginning of aerial resistance against the enemy. From then on, hundreds of flying generals from the six classes shed their blood in the clear sky, fighting enemy planes everywhere. In the autumn of 1938, the seventh class graduated from the Kunming Aviation School, and new blood continuously joined the air force. After the eleventh class graduated, the Kunming Aviation School had to relocate due to enemy air raids and the difficulty of supplying gasoline and aircraft. The United States generously agreed to help, and from the twelfth class onward, intermediate and advanced flight training was conducted in the United States, while primary training remained within Yunnan Province. In 1943, the primary class was moved to Lahore in northwestern India for instruction, but the instructors were still Chinese. Training continued until the 25th class.

The fifteen years of the aviation school symbolize all of China's experiences. In the first five years, it prepared for the War of Resistance Against Japan through diligent training. In the second five years, it was covered in blood, sacrificing itself to preserve the righteous spirit of the airspace and protect the people and the army on the battlefield. In the last five years, it turned defeat into victory, receiving assistance from allied nations and attacking the enemy with abundant energy everywhere until the national flag and the air force eagle flag were raised again at the original site of the Hangzhou Jianqiao Aviation School.

The past history of this school has been manifested in the eight-year history of the Chinese Air Force. From Shen Chonghai, who crashed into an enemy warship at Bailonggang, to Yan Haiwen, who committed suicide under an enemy regiment in Jiangwan, to Zhou Zhikai, who shot down three enemy bombers from a single plane over Liangshan in Sichuan, to Gao Youxin, who flew eight sorties a day to bomb and strafe the enemy forces besieging Hengyang, these are all lofty examples of dedication and success by the students of the aviation school. Generals Mao Bangchu, Huang Guangrui, Chen Qingyun, and Zhou Zhirou, who were responsible for running this school, deserve the honor. The honor given to their principals and the nation by these thousands of air heroes who threw their bones on the battlefield or successfully destroyed enemy planes and warships is greater than the reputation given to old principals Zhang Boling, Mei Yiqi, and Situ by the students of Nankai, Tsinghua, and Yanjing Universities. Only because the war has ended and the deeds of the heroes are buried under the busy pursuit and distribution of living materials, no longer considered valuable or valued, will the passage of time slowly erode its profound form in China's history of independence. The reopening of the Hangzhou Jianqiao Aviation School at its original site can be said to be a commemorative day for inheriting past glorious history and preparing to create future brilliance. On June 15, the Jianqiao airfield, which was covered with deep grass, was cut and made smooth and flat. Sixty Steaman training aircraft, flown back from India over the Hump, were arranged neatly. The instructors, who had endured over ten years of airfield wind, rain, and sunshine, as well as the hardships and dangers of the eight-year war, stood tall in front of the training aircraft they had flown back. The students (from the 24th to the 26th class) lined up in formations like new moons, like new buds undergoing inspection. This commemorative day at the Hangzhou Jianqiao airfield will forever leave a deep impression.

The National Army is now firmly defending the outer perimeter of Qingdao. The U.S. Marine Corps in Qingdao is assisting the municipal police in maintaining order and protecting foreigners. The responsibility for defending Qingdao rests entirely with the National Army. The National Army's morale is greatly boosted because it can be supported by both sea and air.

### Work on Reorganizing and Integrating Communist Troops; Military Mediation Department as Implementing Agency; Gillen, Zhang, and Zhou Signed Basic Plan

### The Truth About the Communist Army's Continued Offensive: Published by the Ministry of National Defense (Continued from Previous Day—End)

Furthermore, after the ceasefire order in the Northeast took effect, the Communist army attacked National forces in various locations in the Northeast and launched fierce offensives against communication routes in Shandong, Hebei, and Shanxi provinces. Their aim was to coordinate with the Communist army's operations in the Northeast and seize cities and territories during the opportunity. Here is a summary of the reports from military commanders in various areas regarding the Communist army's attacks.

"Shandong Area": The Communist army launched a full-scale general offensive into Shandong province on the 7th. (1) Dezhou Airport was captured on the morning of the 8th, and Dezhou city was captured on the evening of the 10th. The military and civilians were bombarded by Communist artillery, resulting in heavy casualties. (2) On the 7th, a part of the Communist army invaded Liaocheng, but was driven out by the defending troops. Fighting continues outside the city gates. (3) Taian city is under heavy attack, and fierce fighting continues. (4) The Hanzhuang Canal railway bridge was blown up on the 9th. (5) Dakou is under heavy attack, and street fighting has broken out. (6) The railway west and east of Licheng up to Hancang (5 kilometers east of the city), and the Zhangxia-Qingyangshu section of the Jinan-Taian railway bridges, were all destroyed on the evening of the 7th. (7) Zhoucun is under heavy attack, and the situation on the 9th is unclear. (8) Zhangdian was captured on the 8th. (9) Changle, Linqu, and Gaomi are all under heavy attack by the Communist army. (10) The Communist army has entered Jiaoxian, and fierce street fighting is ongoing. (11) Lancun, northeast of Jiaoxian, is under attack, and the current situation is unclear. (12) The Communist army has launched heavy attacks on Xiazhuang, Huangbu water source, Liuting Airport, and Chengyang Station, all on the outskirts of Qingdao. The railway bridge between Cangkou and Nugukou, and the tracks between Nugukou and Chengyang, have all been destroyed. (13) Zaozhuang, which has been besieged for several months, was subjected to another general offensive by the Communist army at 7:30 PM on the 9th. They used explosives to destroy the tunnels previously dug leading into Zaozhuang city and destroyed the command headquarters of the defending troops under Wang Gang. Subsequently, they launched a heavy attack with large forces, leading to a breakthrough and street fighting. The fate of the defending commander, Wang Gang, the American representative of the executive group, Massey, the government representative, Yin Zhiqiang, and his entourage are unknown. Team leader Wang Jimei was wounded and his whereabouts are unknown. (14) The outskirts of Jinan are under heavy attack by the Communist army, and the fighting is fierce.

"Hebei Area": (1) On the 9th, the Communist army launched a heavy attack on Changxindian (south of Beiping on the Pinghan Railway). The defending troops were forced to defend themselves and drove them back. (2) The Communist army has gathered its main forces and surrounded Yuanshi, posing a threat to the city. (3) On the 10th, the Communist army launched another attack on Yongnian city, which has been besieged for over nine months, and fighting is currently underway.

"Shanxi Area": (1) At dawn on the 8th, the Communist army launched seven fierce attacks from three directions on the northeast of Zhongyang city. (2) On the evening of the 7th, the Pingyao-Yaoquan section of the southern section of the Tongpu Railway was destroyed by the Communist army. The Pingyao engineering section sent workers three times on the 8th to rush repairs, but they were attacked by the Communist army and forced to retreat.

Based on the above facts and the past situations since the issuance of the first ceasefire order on January 10th of this year, where the Communist army violated the agreement and repeatedly attacked National forces, it is clear that the Communist army has no regard for the nationwide desire for overall peace. The Ministry hereby makes the following statement regarding the current situation: (1) The Communist army should abide by all agreements and promises, immediately cease all military actions, and await mediation. (2) If the Communist army again engages in capturing cities, seizing territories, and attacking National forces during this ceasefire period, causing the National forces to be forced to defend themselves, the Communist army shall bear the responsibility. (3) The government's forbearance and efforts to seek overall solutions have their limits. It is hoped that the Chinese Communist Party will not engage in empty talk and create unnecessary complications to delay matters. They should focus on resolving the issues and concentrate their efforts on restoring transportation and implementing military reorganization plans to achieve peaceful unification and national construction. If they continue to take advantage of this negotiation period, intensifying their actions, and causing the negotiations to become impossible, creating a serious situation, then the responsibility shall be fully borne by the Communist side.

### Actively Promoting Urban Construction: Chongqing Plans a Ten-Year Plan; Tang Honglie Discusses Three Major Current Issues

[Report from Chongqing by this newspaper on the 13th] Chongqing Mayor Zhang Lun reported in the municipal meeting: Chief Zhang of the Xingying returned to Chongqing from Nanjing, and relayed President Chiang's extreme concern for the security of Chongqing city. It is hoped that serious attention will be paid to safeguarding it. He also expressed his great expectations for various construction projects in the city, instructing to follow the established plan and carry it out seriously. Therefore, the police bureau should immediately pay serious attention to the two items of public morals and security in the city. As to how to closely contact the military and police, and how to cooperate with the district security, the police bureau should quickly draft effective measures and submit them for approval and implementation.

[Report from this newspaper] Tang Honglie, Secretary-General of the Chongqing Municipal Government, came to Shanghai on official business yesterday and gave a speech, saying: Since the central government returned to the capital, Chongqing is still the political, economic, cultural, and transportation center of the southwest. Currently, the Chongqing Municipal Government, in order to actively promote urban construction, has drafted a ten-year construction plan based on President Chiang's handwritten order. Building the Two Rivers Bridge, repairing the city's sewers, and completing the northern trunk line are the three major current issues. The northern trunk line project has already begun and is expected to be completed within three months. As for the sewer repair work, it is expected to be completed within one year after construction starts. The total budget requires over 3.45 billion yuan. An American expert, Mr. Mauriel, has been hired to be responsible for the design, and a loan of 2 billion yuan has been obtained from the Four Banks Joint Office, so construction can begin. The next is the Two Rivers Bridge project. President Chiang has approved an allocation of one-third of the total funding, which is currently being claimed from the Executive Yuan, and a loan is being sought from Canada. However, because the project is huge, the Chongqing Municipal Government has submitted a request to first complete the construction of the "Zhongzheng Bridge." This bridge is located from the Dongshuimen Wharf to the opposite side of Xialongmenhao, with a total length of 980 meters. The bridge is divided into two layers. The upper layer is 12 meters wide, enough for four-wheeled vehicles to drive side by side. The lower layer has two sidewalks, each 3 meters wide, for rickshaws and pedestrians. The total construction cost is estimated at over 6 billion, and it is scheduled to be completed in two years. A bridge expert, Mr. Mao Yisheng, has been hired as the director. Construction can begin as soon as two-thirds of the funding allocated by the Executive Yuan is received.

### Food Assistance to China in June, July, and August Will Be Greatly Increased: Zheng Baonan of the Executive Yuan Discusses Relief Issues

[Report from this newspaper] Zheng Baonan, director of the Washington branch of the Executive Yuan, participated in the UNRRA Far East Conference after returning to China this time. He recently came to Shanghai from Nanjing. When a reporter visited yesterday, Zheng first mentioned the request to UNRRA to extend its working time in China. According to him, this request has been submitted at the conference. The European side also has this intention. Representatives from China, the United Kingdom, and the United States have drafted a proposal and established a group to decide on it before July 17 (the date of the next UNRRA Far East Conference) to submit it to the Fifth UNRRA Conference to be held in Paris on August 2. Zheng said that the possibility of approving this request is extremely high.

Regarding transportation work, Zheng said that the current transportation situation can be divided into three stages: The first stage is that the railways from Shanghai to Nanjing, Hankou, Hangzhou, and Tianjin can be said to be unobstructed. The current work focuses on the second stage, which is from Hankou to Hengyang and Changsha, and the third stage, which is from Hengyang and Changsha to remote small towns in the interior. The work is expected to have satisfactory results in the autumn of this year. The ship transportation situation is the same as the land transportation situation, also divided into three stages. Work is now underway to gradually send ship transportation tools to remote counties in the interior.

At this point, the reporter raised the food problem that China urgently needs to solve. Zheng said that before this problem, we must first recognize a fact, that is, food is lacking in all parts of the world, not just in China, and each country has its own prejudices. Take the United Kingdom as an example, helping Siam will naturally be ahead of China. Zheng solemnly pointed out that the relief food received by China in June, July, and August of this year can be greatly increased because the harvest period in Europe is June, and the amount of relief needed during this period is not much. The reporter then asked how the Executive Yuan and UNRRA should strengthen cooperation in their work. Regarding this point, Zheng said that the Executive Yuan and UNRRA have always maintained a very good relationship, and it is hoped that they will be able to cooperate even better in the future. Both sides have mutual criticisms, but these criticisms are well-intentioned, and the goal is to make the work have greater progress. [Another dispatch] Zou Baonan left Shanghai by plane for Washington yesterday morning.

### Anhui Provincial Capital Will Be Moved Back to Anqing

[Report from Nanjing by this newspaper on the 13th] Before the war, the provincial capital of Anhui was originally located in Anqing. After the victory, it was changed to Hefei. According to a senior official of the Anhui Provincial Government who came to Nanjing to speak to reporters, the Anhui Provincial Capital will soon have to be moved back to Anqing. The reason is that although Hefei is located in the center of Anqing, transportation there is inconvenient, and the buildings are not as good as Anqing. Therefore, the post-war restoration of the provincial government in Hefei was actually of a temporary nature.

### Two Factories in Guangzhou: A Beverage Factory Manufactures Beer and Soda; A Textile Factory Is the Largest in South China

[Report from Guangzhou by this newspaper on the 12th] Yesterday, the reporter visited the Guangdong Industrial Company's beverage factory and textile factory. The former was reopened on October 1st of last year after being taken over. It can produce 50,000 bottles of beer and 300,000 bottles of soda per month. The latter was established in July of the 22nd year of the Republic and is the only textile factory with the largest scale in South China. It has 20,000 spindles, but most of the machines were damaged after the occupation. The factory's machines are made in the United Kingdom, and the products are very good. However, the weaving part has not yet been restored. The spinning part is currently only operating 5,000 spindles, producing 75 bales of yarn per month, which is 30,000 pounds. It is estimated that it can only supply about one-fifth of the city's needs. In addition, Lan Xun, the general manager of the company, said that the company's main business is to develop industry, and the principle is to support private industry, and will never compete with the people for profit. For the revitalization of the Guangdong silk industry, a silk industry production chain committee will be established to assist in the development of the province's silk industry.

### Dai Representative Arrives in Yunnan to Present a Flag: Discusses the Life of Border Ethnic Groups; Hopes Compatriots in the Interior Will Help Develop the Border Areas

[Aviation dispatch from Kunming by this newspaper on the 10th] Nan Tianfu, a representative of the Dai and Kawa peoples of the Cangyuan Establishment Zone, arrived in Kunming a few days ago to report the situation of the border area to the Yunnan Provincial Government and present a flag to Chairman Lu Han. Nan told reporters yesterday: Cangyuan is adjacent to the Kawa Mountains (the undetermined border between China and Myanmar) in the west and is often attacked by the Lao Kang (savages). The Lao Kang have superior firearms and new tactics, and they often use guerrilla tactics to invade the border people, intending to occupy the important strongholds of Ban Nong and Kawa Mountain. Although a part of the National Army is stationed in Ban Hong and Cangyuan City, it is inconvenient to go deep due to certain reasons, so the border people feel extremely uneasy. I hope that compatriots in the interior will give more guidance and assistance to develop the border areas as soon as possible. He also said that if the director of the Cangyuan Establishment Bureau is a suitable person, the Kawa princes near Cangyuan, such as the Ban Hong King, Yonghe King, Manjiong King, and Shaoqing King, may all return to the motherland. When the reporter asked about the living conditions of the border people, it was said that the Kawa people are divided into "wild" and "pure", and the Dai people are divided into "water" and "dry." The pure Kawa are slightly similar to the Han people, while the wild Kawa have the legacy of ancient ethnic groups. The Kawa people live on the top of mountains, and the Dai people mostly live on plains. The Kawa language is difficult to understand, and the Dai language is relatively common and easy to learn. In recent years, there has been trade and intermarriage between the Dai and Han people, and the Han language is becoming increasingly popular. Dai and pure Kawa men like to learn from the Han people, and their clothing, food, and accommodation are similar to those of the Han people. Women still maintain their native costumes, wearing short tops and long skirts, and like to wear silver ornaments. The Dai people like to eat glutinous rice sauerkraut, while the Kawa people do not pay attention to hygiene in their diet. Marriage is very free. If a man and a woman love each other, they can get married even without the consent of their parents. Before a man is married, he can talk and laugh with any girl, but this is impossible after marriage. Men like to play the sanxian (a three-stringed plucked instrument), and if they gain the love of a woman, they can live together. Parents are proud of this. The border people are very superstitious, and they are mostly harmonious with each other, especially the Dai people who are the kindest. The wild Kawa people still have the habit of taking heads, but they are not as barbaric as commonly said. Nan traveled for 29 days on the way to Kunming this time and plans to return to Cangyuan after presenting the flag.

[Report from Nanjing by this newspaper on the 13th] It is reported that the National Defense Council and the Central Standing Committee had requested instructions from President Chiang on the end of the Supreme National Defense Council. Yesterday, they received the instruction to "postpone the handling." However, it is said that it will wait until the government is reorganized and the Central Political Conference is established before it ends, which shows that the central government still has great confidence in peace, unity, and unification.

### Suzhou Higher Court Establishes a Detention Guard Training Institute

[Report from Suzhou by this newspaper on the 13th] The Suzhou Higher Court believes that the spirit of the rule of law should be cultivated from lower-level cadres. Because prison guards generally lack education, they often use their powers to commit various acts of dereliction of duty. Although the impact is minor, it should be closely monitored and eliminated as it undermines the integrity and ethics of the rule of law. Therefore, a detention guard training institute has been established in the No. 3 Prison of Suzhou. The number of students in the first session is tentatively set at 50. For the time being, there will be no enrollment examination. Trainees will be selected from the active-duty guards by the higher and lower courts. The subjects are divided into military training, the Three Principles of the People, the Criminal Procedure Law, the Criminal Law, the Prison Regulations, the Detention Center Regulations, the Prison Execution Law, official document formats, the detention guard service regulations, and spiritual lectures. Chen Songnian, the warden, has been appointed by the Higher Court as the director of the institute.

### Wang Yunwu Talks About Economic Issues

[Dispatch from Nanjing by Agence France-Presse on the 12th] The newly appointed Minister of Economic Affairs, Wang Yunwu, recently gave an exclusive interview to a reporter from this agency, saying: "I want to summon forty industrialists and labor representatives to come to Nanjing for a meeting, in order to arouse attention to the necessity of China's industrialization. Regarding this matter, the plan I have drafted is not yet mature and I cannot discuss it in detail, but I hope that industry and agriculture will advance at the same time. China's current economic difficulties can be half solved by peaceful restoration. Increasing production has become the most serious and important issue, but before discussing increasing production, we must first solve the labor problem. I do not believe that continuing to raise wages and that labor and capital should share profits equally are practical solutions. Currently, wages have reached a level that prevents production from having a good start. If they are raised again, the consequences will be unimaginable. On the contrary, we deeply hope that labor and capital will cooperate closely. For labor-capital disputes, we intend to implement mediation and compulsory arbitration, but we do not want to promote a policy of state intervention. Instead, we want to prevent strikes and labor agitation in a fair and impartial manner. The government has not enforced existing laws regarding labor-capital disputes, which is regrettable. It is also necessary to invest in production to prevent speculation. Regarding the development of agriculture and industry, we plan to develop wasteland and improve water conservancy. All methods have long been condensed, but they have not been implemented due to the war. In the future, we hope to increase food production in a short period of time to eliminate the current food shortage. We need long-term efforts, but we firmly believe that we can overcome all difficulties. UNRRA is currently making large-scale efforts and cooperating with the Chinese authorities. The Executive Yuan has also saved tens of thousands of lives, but transportation difficulties often cause us problems. I want to use existing transportation tools to the extent possible and cooperate with the Ministry of Communications to do my best to help millions of innocent victims. This work is extremely difficult, and we are facing many major difficulties."

### Correspondences from Various Places: The Youth Army Expresses Concern for the Xiang Disaster and Generously Donates: The Chairman Grants Money

A Zhenxiang Committee Is Formed to Specialize in Solicitation Work; The 614th Regiment Has Donated 4 Million Yuan to Xiang

[Special Dispatch from Guiyang by this newspaper] The officers and soldiers of the 614th Regiment of the 205th Division of the Youth Expeditionary Army are deeply concerned about the Xiang disaster and have formed a Zhenxiang Committee to specialize in solicitation work. The officers and soldiers generously donated the bonuses and salary increases awarded by the Chairman during the review to the Zhenxiang fund to help the people of Xiang. A total of more than 4 million yuan was obtained, which has been remitted to the Xiang Provincial Government, and a telegram of condolences was sent. Their enthusiasm and sincerity are unprecedented. The 613th and 611th Regiments and the direct subordinate units of the division have also been mobilized and the results are very good. It is estimated that a total of more than 10 million yuan can be obtained. In the past, they witnessed the serious national crisis and enlisted in the army with the old ambition of dedicating themselves to the country. Now they are generously helping the disaster. This great spirit of patriotism and love for the people is worthy of our respect.

### Over a Thousand Tea Farmers in Suzhou Petition for Exemption from Special Tax

[Special Dispatch from Our Suzhou Correspondent] After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, local governments at all levels resumed operations. However, due to the extreme shortage of central government funding allocations, the salaries of public servants, educators, police, and security personnel could not be increased, severely affecting administrative efficiency. Considering the excessive depletion of local finances, the Jiangsu Provincial Government believed that finding new sources of revenue was essential to mitigate the crisis of administrative collapse. It approved the implementation of taxes tailored to local conditions by subordinate counties. Upon receiving this order, the Wu County Government planned to levy special taxes on tea and flowers used in medicine. These plans were passed by the Provisional Assembly and are currently being submitted to the province for approval. However, the production of tea flowers in Suzhou is extremely minimal, limited to the Tiger Hill area. Over a thousand flower farmers have relied on this occupation for generations. The imposition of a special tax would inevitably threaten their livelihoods. Previously, they appealed to the public through newspapers, arguing that tea flowers should be treated as an agricultural product and exempted from taxation. When the Provincial Provisional Assembly opened, they even sent five representatives to the meeting to request an exemption, which was initially granted. They were asked to raise it to the Provincial Government for consideration. Now, the county government has sent personnel to the Tiger Hill area to investigate the production of tea flowers, causing considerable anxiety among the flower farmers. On the morning of the 12th, around a thousand of them gathered and marched into the city to petition the Provisional Assembly, the county party headquarters, and the county government. The head of the County Social Affairs Section, Lu Shaofen, received the flower farmer representatives, who stated their concerns. They argued that the government was already imposing burdens through the procurement of military grain, income tax, and business tax. Adding a special tax would not only be redundant and burdensome but would also drive the flower farmers to bankruptcy. They implored for an exemption. They proposed that if the government's finances were truly depleted and this measure was necessary, the thousand-plus flower farmers would be willing to contribute all their wealth voluntarily, but they were unwilling to be subject to a special tax. Section Chief Lu promised to discuss the matter with the county magistrate within three days and provide a response. During these three days, they were granted the freedom to buy and sell without paying taxes. The flower farmers then dispersed and returned.

Suzhou

Xunyang Middle School Ordered Closed by Provincial Decree

Xunyang Middle School, located in Inguo Lane within the city, was founded by Qian Liang. During the enemy-puppet period, Qian also operated a private Chongshi Middle School.

After the victory, Qian re-established the Youth Association and Xunyang Middle School, whose content was corrupt and purely aimed at profiteering. Recently, an incident occurred where students insulted teacher Shen Zhongyin, causing Shen to go insane. After investigation by the Provincial Department of Education, the Wu County Government was ordered by telegram yesterday to shut it down.

### Editorial: After the Conclusion of the Finance and Grain Conference

The Finance and Food Ministries convened the Finance and Grain Conference in Nanjing on the 6th of this month to discuss methods for reforming the financial revenue and expenditure system and adjusting the revenue and expenditure budgets of provinces, cities, and counties. It concluded on the 10th. The revised methods agreed upon will be implemented from July 1st. This is of great significance to the national economy and the people's livelihood, especially given the severe financial deficits and the serious grain shortages in various provinces. During this conference, more than a hundred proposals were put forward by various parties regarding the four issues of land tax, grain, taxation, and budgeting. All participants engaged in the most enthusiastic debate and discussion. The most noteworthy issues were: one, the extension of the method of land tax collection in kind for another year; and two, the adjustment of the financial revenue and expenditure budgets of various provinces, cities, and counties. Although the conference decided on implementation methods for these two issues, further clarification is still necessary.

The current financial revenue and expenditure system was decided upon at the National Finance Conference in June of the 30th year of the Republic (1941). At that time, China was engaged in a desperate battle against the Japanese invaders and urgently needed to centralize financial resources and control materials to win victory. Therefore, it was decided to implement the method of land tax collection in kind and reform the financial revenue and expenditure system, dividing national finance into two systems: national finance and local finance, and abolishing provincial-level finance. The original intention of the legislation at the time was, on the one hand, to increase national treasury revenue, and on the other hand, to enrich county-level tax sources in order to promote the new county system and implement local autonomy. However, in practice, although the land tax, which accounted for more than 70 percent of local taxes, was directly collected by the central government, the central government was still unable to make ends meet. Local governments, on the other hand, were unable to undertake various tasks that should have been done, such as clearing up household registration, reorganizing the Baojia system, and surveying land. By August of last year, the Anti-Japanese War had ended victoriously, and national reconstruction was rapidly unfolding. The implementation of constitutional governance was not far off, and local self-government needed to be accelerated. Therefore, China's wartime financial revenue and expenditure system was outdated and needed to be revised immediately. The restoration of provincial-level finance was almost imminent. In March of this year, the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee was held in Chongqing and decided to amend the current financial revenue and expenditure system in order to achieve balanced development of central and local finances. Principles were also drafted and handed over to the government for implementation. The Finance and Food Ministries, recognizing that the 35th fiscal year was rapidly approaching, convened this conference to discuss implementation methods.

Regarding provincial finance, since the provinces began receiving and carrying out restoration work in August of last year, they have encountered major difficulties. On the one hand, the provincial governments needed a great deal of funding, while the central government subsidies were limited and could not be issued on time. On the other hand, the provincial governments were limited by laws and had no room to plan for funding. As a result, the finances of various provinces were in deficit, government affairs could not be promoted, financial management had no solutions, and everything became empty talk, which is the so-called "a clever wife cannot cook without rice." This time, the reform of the financial revenue and expenditure system restored the previous three-level system and stipulated that 30% of the land tax collected in kind would go to the central government, 20% to the provinces, and 50% to the local governments. Financial experts estimate that even with this allocation, provincial finances will still be difficult to maintain, and the representatives of various provinces have also recounted their difficulties. In particular, poor provinces will still find it difficult to balance their income and expenditure under the new system and will have to find ways to make up for it. Therefore, three more measures were decided: (1) Each province and city should prepare a revenue and expenditure comparison table and submit it to the central government for the allocation of subsidies; (2) The expenses for staff salaries should be managed from the surplus revenue from the sale of goods in kind; (3) Remote provinces and unrecovered areas should request special subsidies from the central government for necessary operational expenses. In this way, provincial finances may be solved in part, but given the central government's own severe financial deficits, provincial finances cannot yet be considered to have a solution.

Speaking of the method of collecting land tax in kind, it has been in effect for a full five years since July of the 30th year of the Republic (1941). Although corruption was unavoidable during this time, it was ultimately a major achievement in the history of China's grain administration. It not only solved the most serious military grain problem during China's War of Resistance but also stabilized prices and at least stabilized the lives of civil servants and educators through government grain control. But in practice, because the implementation methods were difficult to perfect, collectors easily manipulated them, and transportation and storage were cumbersome, public revenue was limited, and the burden on the people was not light. In addition, the weight of rice varied greatly depending on whether it was dry or wet, and rice was easily mixed with impurities, resulting in significant differences in quality. Rice could not be stored for long and rotted and deteriorated without any standards. After several transfers, it often deteriorated and fell short in quantity. And the general collection personnel often stole from the sky and changed the day, gradually transferring the nation's public grain into their private pockets. This phenomenon was almost unavoidable to some extent in every province and county. The suicides of some grain officials may also have been due to past unreliable grain accounts. Wartime collection in kind was unavoidable, but now that the war is over, it is reasonable to abolish collection in kind. However, the government has still decided to extend the collection in kind method for another year, which must be due to its great difficulties. As President Chiang Kai-shek said: "The decision to extend the collection of land tax in kind for another year at this conference is necessary to complete the reconstruction work. However, local grain authorities should be especially mindful of the suffering of the people when collecting in kind, reduce collection procedures, and strictly prohibit harassment to facilitate the people." It is hoped that all local officials who attended the conference will repeatedly admonish their subordinates to implement the collection in kind after they return, always remembering that it is a last resort and never treating collection in kind as a convenient door for private gain.

Eighty percent of the Chinese people are farmers. During this War of Resistance, they supported the country's resistance with vast manpower and military grain, contributing more than ever before. But after the victory, looking at the rural areas across the country, not to mention the disaster areas, even in the most prosperous Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces, the rural areas have reached the brink of collapse. Now is the time to rest with the people! National officials should truly take responsibility, avoid suspicion and resentment, rectify the political climate, and no longer allow corrupt officials to impose exorbitant taxes on the countryside in the name of collection in kind, causing widespread complaints from the common people! Grain administration authorities should especially learn from the past, prevent problems before they occur, and eliminate all malpractices, so as not to betray the central government's painstaking efforts to extend collection in kind for another year.

Correction: In yesterday's editorial, the last two lines, the word "totalitarianism" was mistakenly printed as "rescue." We hereby correct this.

### Nimitz Reports to the House of Representatives: U.S. Post-War Fleet Plan

The quality is equal to the entire world's fleet; the current quantity is also nearly equal to the total of all countries.

[United Press, Washington, December 12th] The House Appropriations Committee submitted an annual naval expenditure bill to the House of Representatives, accompanied by a report from Chief of Naval Operations Nimitz, stating: As of January 1, 1946, the number of U.S. warships was nearly equal to the total number of warships of all other countries in the world. The proportion of major warships is as follows:

However, most U.S. warships will be dismantled or decommissioned. The famous ships that the authorities plan to retain are as follows:

Battleships: Four active, two reserve, ten decommissioned but available for service.

Cruisers: Twenty-nine active, ten reserve, thirty decommissioned.

Aircraft Carriers: Twelve active, three reserve, twenty-two decommissioned.

Escort Carriers: Ten active, fifty-six decommissioned, none in reserve.

Destroyers: One hundred and twenty-six active, twenty-two reserve, two hundred and five decommissioned.

Destroyer Escorts: Thirty active, four reserve, two hundred and four decommissioned.

Submarines: Twenty active, one hundred and six decommissioned.

The organization of the post-war fleet will generally follow the following method:

Pacific Fleet: Deploy amphibious forces suitable for transporting a Marine division for reinforcement, totaling seven aircraft carriers, six escort carriers, two battleships, seventeen cruisers, seventy-two destroyers, thirty-nine submarines, and sixteen destroyer escorts.

Atlantic Fleet: Equip with sufficient strength to reinforce a Marine division, totaling five aircraft carriers, four escort carriers, two battleships, eleven cruisers, forty-five destroyers, forty-one submarines, and fourteen destroyer escorts.

Each fleet should be accompanied by a naval air force, the size of which will depend on funding. A reserve fleet will be maintained in both the Atlantic and Pacific. This active and reserve fleet is the minimum standard of preparedness. Under the current international situation, it is appropriate. The post-war fleet plan, in terms of quality, will be equal to the entire world's fleet.

### International Tribunal Continues Trial of Japanese War Criminals; Judges from Eleven Countries Attend; Prosecutors Present Evidence; The Crime of the Defendant Initiating War in Violation of Treaties is Clear

[United Press, Tokyo, December 13th] The Far East International Tribunal continued its trial today. Australian prosecutor Mansfield, representing the prosecution, presented nearly a hundred kinds of historical documents and treaties to prove that the 28 defendants launched wars of aggression in the Far East in violation of treaties. The defense, through American statutory lawyer Matic, requested to reserve the right to rebut this evidence. The treaties presented by the prosecution traced back to the International Convention for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes signed in The Hague on July 27, 1899, as well as other treaties signed and ratified by Japan; to prove that Japan disregarded basic international rules, arbitrarily implemented its colonial acquisition plan, and launched the Pacific War at Pearl Harbor without formally declaring war in accordance with the Hague Convention ratified by Japan in 1907. Judges from eleven countries attended together today for the first time. The new Philippine judge, Galanilla, sat alongside judges from China, the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, France, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and India. The application of four defendants to submit the case to a jury composed of leaders of international religious and intellectual circles was rejected.

Large Maps Hang on Both Walls

In order to prove the defendants' conspiracy of aggression, the prosecution specially made thirteen large maps and hung them on both walls, indicating the route of Japan's invasion of land from 1931 until its surrender. The bright red markings on the maps proved the expansion of Japan's sphere of influence in Manchuria and China. After 1931, the maps were all painted scarlet. The defendants watched the unfolding of the maps with a very strange feeling. The defendants' lawyers objected to the presentation of the maps. Chief Judge Webb declared that the maps could be used as evidence. At this point, Tojo's defense lawyer, Ichiro, asked the court to pay attention to the erroneous boundary line of the Soviet Primorsky Krai, but the court ignored it. Deputy Prosecutor (Canada) Norren, dressed in military uniform, appeared in court for the first time and presented a lengthy statement of seventy-six pages on the organization of the Japanese state. The court adjourned temporarily at 12:15 p.m. and resumed at 1:50 p.m.

[Kaizo Sha, Tokyo, December 13th] The defendant's defense team, led by Hiroya Koki, argued that the army and navy "should not be tried separately," and the court rejected the defense.

### An Ugly Scene with Japanese Performers

At the founding meeting, they played the funeral march of the Rising Sun as a way to "bury old Japan."

At that time, it was decided to publish a quarterly magazine "Fire" to promote the Japanese literary renaissance and to host exhibitions, concerts, and dance performances. Suddenly, many beers, whiskeys, and genuine sake appeared from nowhere. The attendees were salivating and drank like cattle. When they became drunk, they inexplicably fought and wrestled together in at least ten incidents. There was even a poet of some faction, shaking his head and reciting his masterpiece, until the fight was enjoyable, several people were injured, and they dispersed in a rush.

### Mayor Wu Inspects Rice Markets and Gives Instructions: Daring Rice Racketeers Attempt to Cause Trouble Again; Garrison Command Begins Thorough Investigation; Responsible Persons of Rice Stores with Loans Will Be Summoned One by One

[Our Own Correspondent] Since the authorities strictly prohibited speculation in the city's grain market, prices have trended downward. However, black market transactions were discovered again yesterday, and the market experienced slight fluctuations. Therefore, Mayor Wu personally went to the Qingyun Pavilion Rice Market at 10:30 AM yesterday to give instructions, saying: "I hope that all rice stores can adhere to their positions and consider the people's food. If rice stores do not have rice available, they can register with the Rice Trade Association and find a way to supply it, so that the city's food can be resolved reasonably." He left after about twenty minutes. In addition, the Bureau of Social Affairs strictly prohibits private transactions and does not allow brokers to enter the market. The authorities are investigating the average transaction figures of all firms over the past month in great detail. In addition to supplying the market's needs, they are not allowed to sell more, in order to prevent hoarding. For rice sold at retail stores, the firm must issue invoices to customers. If invoices are not issued, citizens can report it.

The city government attaches great importance to the smooth flow of grain sources. It has telegraphed the Ministry of Food and the Jiangsu Provincial Government to request the suppression of price increases in rice-producing areas and to facilitate Shanghai rice merchants in purchasing grain from producing areas. The amount of rice currently registered in the city is 500,000 dan. The daily market demand is about 7,600 dan. In terms of the total amount of rice in storage, it is sufficient for two months. Rice from domestic producing areas arrives daily in the amount of about 4,000 to 10,000 dan. Moreover, foreign rice can be shipped in steadily. There is no need to worry about the source of rice.

### Secret Transactions Still Occur Outside the Market

[Another Report] Recently, due to the unwillingness of rice stores to release goods and the inability of rice firms to wholesale, there have been very few transactions in the rice market. Many of the transactions are for substandard goods, and black market transactions are conducted at high prices. Yesterday morning, our reporter made a tour of the Qingyun Pavilion Rice Market and happened to witness Mayor Wu inspecting the area and giving instructions.

Transactions in the market yesterday were still scarce. Those with goods were still taking a wait-and-see attitude, and those offering goods were mostly substandard. Our reporter witnessed 300 shi of indica rice being sold for 46,400 yuan each. Good goods are still traded secretly outside the market.

After Mayor Wu's visit and instructions, the general reaction was very good. People discussed it one after another, saying that many people would sell tomorrow. A rice firm owner complained: "Having been in the rice business until today, I have never seen such a dead end. Rice firms have nowhere to buy rice. If we buy at a high price, we cannot bear the losses. We have already survived the eight years of the War of Resistance, why can't we survive the coming February? After the new grain comes on the market, the situation will improve. For the time being, we will let the speculators fall into the net of the law by themselves, and don't be misled."

### Former Jiangsu Provincial Police Commissioner Zhang Songtao's Trial Concluded, Awaiting Sentencing; Wu Liande's Appeal Retried Yesterday

[Our Newspaper's Report] Zhang Songtao, the former puppet Jiangsu Provincial Police Commissioner, was retried in the High Court yesterday afternoon. According to his testimony: his assets in the Yangtze Hotel amounted to only 5,000 shares, each worth 100 yuan. During his tenure as a puppet commissioner, he rescued underground workers Xu Chongzhi and Yang Hui in the 28th year [of the Republic of China]. In the 29th year, he was arrested by puppet secret agents and was bailed out by Chen Qun and Ren Yuandao, but he was not allowed to leave Shanghai. His relationship with Chen Qun was that of a friend. His appointment as puppet commissioner was due to Chen's recommendation, and he was appointed by the Police Department of the puppet Jiangsu Provincial Government as a puppet official. During his tenure, he only handled theft cases and maintained law and order. Political matters were handled by the "Political Security Bureau". All opium dens were under the jurisdiction of the Anti-Smoking Bureau, which had nothing to do with him, and so on. The case will be sentenced at 2:30 PM on the 20th of this month. The case of Ma Suiliang, a former clerk of the 3rd Section of the puppet Investigation and Statistics Department, will also be sentenced on the same day.

Wu was dissatisfied, and his wife, Liu Yansong, claimed, "Zhang Haoran, the director-general of the puppet Incense and Candle Tax Bureau in Shanghai, was only sentenced to five years. Wu Liande was just a small district director, yet he was sentenced to seven years. It's really unfair." She applied for a retrial, which has been approved. When the trial opened yesterday morning, Judge Qiu inquired in detail about his surrender to General Mao Sen, the Southeast Special Commissioner of the Military Statistics Bureau, providing secret information about the enemy, and covering up underground work. The case was then adjourned for further hearing. The cases of Yang Tao, the former magistrate of Qingpu County; Chen Wanli, the former deputy chief of the Special High Section of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau; and Lu Xiangquan, the former head of the Intelligence Unit of the puppet Xinchang County Garrison in Zhejiang, were also examined and adjourned for further hearing.

### Former Vice Minister of Propaganda and Editor-in-Chief of Ta Kung Weekly, Zhang Ke, Appeals for Leniency, Claims to Have Protected the Central Government and Criticized the Enemy with Dauntless Spirit: "Using Speech to Show Loyalty and Make Amends"?

[Our Newspaper's Report] In the late spring of last year, just as the US Navy was approaching the Japanese mainland and the "rising sun" was about to set, a publication that was popular in the occupied areas appeared in the Nanjing-Shanghai area. Its name was "Ta Kung". Calling on the Japanese army to withdraw troops was in line with the wishes of the myopic public. However, "Ta Kung" was, after all, a propaganda publication of the puppet regime, so its organizer, Zhang Ke (former Vice Minister of Propaganda of the puppet regime), was finally arrested and imprisoned, to be punished by the national law.

Zhang is from Hangzhou, is 43 years old, graduated from the Department of Political Economy of Yenching University, studied at the University of Berlin in Germany, and obtained a master's degree in Political Economy and Municipal Administration from Columbia University in the United States. After returning to China, he served as the personal secretary of Foreign Minister Chen Youren and accompanied Chen to Moscow, Berlin, and other places. Later, he served as a professor at Yenching, Zhongshan, and other universities for more than ten years. After the war, he retreated west with the government and served as a political instructor in the Youth Cadre Training Corps. Later, at Chen's invitation, he went to Hong Kong to work as his personal assistant and taught at the Ministry of Finance's Taxation College. When the Pacific War broke out and Hong Kong fell, Zhang and Chen were captured together. After arriving in Shanghai, Chen died of illness in the summer of the 31st year [of the Republic of China]. Zhang then went to Nanjing and, at the invitation of Lin Baisheng, the puppet Minister of Propaganda, took office as the Deputy Minister of Propaganda. Later, due to the unsuccessful suggestion to convene a representative conference of the people in the occupied areas, he resigned in November of the same year and secretly agreed with the enemy "Ambassador" Taniguchi's "Secretary" Shimizu on two principles: (1) To use democratic unity to save the country as a slogan, to approach other parties, to disperse the strength of the resistance, in order to implement the enemy's divisive policy. (2) To be allowed to publish requests for Japan to withdraw its troops stationed in China, so that the enemy could transfer some of its elite troops back to the country to defend its homeland. In April of the 34th year [of the Republic of China], the "Ta Kung Weekly" was published in Shanghai, advocating the aforementioned suggestions and promoting "Sino-Japanese peace" and opposing the Allied forces fighting in China. It was published for thirteen issues and was discontinued in July of the 34th year due to various reasons. After the victory, he was arrested by the Military Statistics Bureau and transferred to the High Procuratorate for investigation, and was prosecuted according to law.

Yesterday morning, Judge Qiu opened the trial. The defendant's lawyer, Yan Hongshihao, acted as his defender. Zhang wore a gray suit and yellow leather shoes, and his hair was neatly combed, possessing a rather "scholarly demeanor". According to his statement, after being captured, he was escorted to Shanghai and, based on a citizen's stance, refused any enticements or threats. In June of the 33rd year [of the Republic of China], due to his classmate relationship with Lin Baisheng, the puppet Minister of Propaganda, they often visited each other and frequently worried about the situation in the southeast. Therefore, he advocated abolishing the puppet government, returning power to the central government, and forming a committee to relieve the people in the occupied areas. This proposal was approved by Chen Gongbo and Lin Baisheng, and Zeng Qi of the Youth Party was present at the time, saying that he would take this suggestion to Chongqing with his status as a senator for discussion. Lin then invited Zhang to join the puppet government to jointly implement his proposals, and he agreed. However, after taking office, Lin did nothing about the agreed points, and the defendant was unable to do anything alone. Therefore, he decided to resign and use the convenience of his puppet position to obtain a registration certificate and publish the Ta Kung Weekly, in order to implement the central government's plan to return power and provide relief to the people, which he was unable to implement during his tenure as a puppet official. During his five months in "office", he never participated in promoting the puppet government or promoting peace movements, and he did not collude with the enemy or plot to resist his own country. The defendant should be subject to national law, but he hopes for leniency. As for the publication of the Ta Kung Weekly, he argued that "he used a dauntless spirit to protect the central government, criticize the crimes of the enemy and puppet regime, and promote the achievements of the Allied countries, put forward the people's spirit and the belief in the victory of the resistance war, and used speech to show loyalty and make amends, which shows the defendant's heart." After Judge Qiu inquired in detail, the case was adjourned for further hearing.

### Glass Age, Glass Mania: Glass Belts, Glass Shoes, All Kinds of Goods in Glass Cabinets

Some people regard the current Shanghai as the "Glass Age". Almost everyone has a glass belt, and glass shoes are also slowly becoming popular. If you want cheap glass belts, you can buy them from roadside stalls. These stalls are now adding a lot of vitality to the roads. The most concentrated areas are in the vicinity of Lloyd Road and Xinzha Road near the New World. Their small cabinets are filled with all kinds of goods, both food and daily necessities. Some are even domestic goods, but they are labeled as American goods, so the "American obsessed" are flocking to them.

Recently, there was a commotion in their small circle. American military police (MP) and shore patrol (SP) have confiscated goods from several stalls more than once. The evening newspaper even reported a few days ago that American military police had arrested street vendors. According to reporters, these stalls are nominally selling US military supplies, but military supplies account for only two or three out of ten. Although they sell Malboro cigarettes and glass belts, they have all paid taxes. They even sell domestic goods, such as Maocheng sunglasses, milk powder, and Indian poplin. The Indian poplin is mostly purchased from the Sisters Flower, Bing Daxiang, and other cloth stores, and they have invoices as proof. The vendors often come to the newspaper to complain about the confiscation of their goods. It is said that some SPs often take Maocheng glasses, hide canned cigarettes, and leave without asking questions. Because the incidents happened suddenly, the vendors were in a panic and did not have time to identify the license plate numbers of the SP patrol vehicles. When they went to the Military Police Headquarters, they could not find out anything. Therefore, a question arises here: if the military supplies have been confiscated, where can they ask for the return of the legal goods? There are about 10,000 street vendors in Shanghai. Most of them borrowed capital from usurers to set up stalls. The larger capital is around one million, and the smallest is between two or three hundred thousand. Therefore, once the goods are confiscated, the losses are very huge. They believe that the main reason for their grievances is that military supplies actually account for a very small percentage of the confiscated goods. Most of them are domestic goods or American goods that have already been taxed. Moreover, whenever they go to the US Military Police Headquarters to inquire, no one can give them a responsible answer. As for the very small portion of military supplies in all their goods, they are also wholesaled by the scalpers in the central market and are not directly received as stolen goods. In addition, some of the American goods circulating on the market are also sold by American soldiers themselves, but they do not want Chinese legal tender. It is estimated that the total consumption of American soldiers in Shanghai is about one to two million US dollars per month. They use goods to collect US dollar bills back, which is a very large loss in our country's foreign exchange. The act of American soldiers selling goods to recover US dollars may have been tacitly approved by their superiors.

Regarding whether American military police can directly confiscate the goods of Chinese street vendors in Shanghai, or even whether they can directly arrest Chinese street vendors, there seems to be a question. To this end, the reporter visited the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs the day before yesterday afternoon. According to the office, they were not aware of such things happening and believed that if American military police did arrest our country's street vendors, the inside story would not be as simple as we think. However, if the actions of the American military police are really illegal and infringe upon our country's sovereignty, the government will of course file a protest in accordance with the law.

American Military Police Investigate Tightly, Treating Non-Military Supplies as Military Supplies

### Garment Industry Price Increases; Labor and Management Reach an Agreement

After the resolution of various labor disputes in the city, employers often use increased expenses as an excuse to implement price increases to compensate. Therefore, the ultimate burden is still added to the citizens, which is enough to stimulate other prices and cause a general increase. Yesterday (the 13th), labor and management in the garment industry reached an agreement. The labor dispute in the industry, which had been going on for many days, was resolved after the efforts of representatives from both sides to mediate. Starting yesterday, the original wages will be adjusted. (The current labor cost for making a single long gown is now 17,000 yuan per piece, and a single cheongsam is 11,000 yuan.)

After the American Gui Tou Pai DDT Insecticide Company sprayed our newspaper's dormitory free of charge a few days ago, bedbugs disappeared at night, and sleep was undisturbed. It is said that the company's DDT spraying is completely service-oriented. If public places entrust them to spray, they will not charge a fee, only slightly collect the cost of the chemicals. The above picture shows the spraying service situation of our newspaper.

### Four Traitors Sentenced

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday, the Special Criminal Court of the High Court sentenced three cases of traitors: (1) Yang Yirong, an informant of the enemy Military Police Team in Taixing, colluded with the enemy and served in relevant military positions. He was sentenced to two and a half years of imprisonment and deprived of public rights for two years. (2) Jin Hui, the director of the Nanjing Reformation Institute of the puppet Special Agent Headquarters, colluded with the enemy and plotted to resist his own country. He was sentenced to six years of imprisonment and deprived of public rights for six years. (3) Tie Po'er and Tie Jiaxing, two translators of the enemy Naval Department, jointly colluded with the enemy and plotted to resist our country.

### Japanese War Criminal Yuasa Torakichi Embezzled Prisoner Rations and Abused and Killed Prisoners; Trial Concluded, Sentencing Scheduled

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday afternoon, the Military Tribunal continued to try Yuasa Torakichi, the former manager of the enemy's Shanghai prisoner-of-war camp. Yuasa's charges are embezzlement of prisoner rations and abuse and killing of prisoners. Yesterday, Ouyang Chen, a quartermaster of the Special Affairs Regiment of the Garrison Headquarters, testified in court. According to him: prisoners of war were often hungry and could not eat, but they were forced to do hard labor every day. If they were slightly disobedient, they would be whipped by Yuasa, resulting in the death of many people. Yuasa claimed: he was not a soldier, but only a labor manager. He did beat prisoners of war, but he did not know that it would lead to death. The killing was the responsibility of the team leader, Hanashima, and the prisoner rations were also not managed by him. Yuasa is short in stature and wears a coarse cloth Chinese-style gown, looking quite dull. The pro bono lawyer, Jiang Weiping, defended the defendant, saying that the prisoner rations were not managed by Yuasa, and there was no definite evidence of killing. However, the defendant admitted to whipping prisoners of war, so he was only guilty of the crime of injury under the criminal law. The court concluded the investigation and trial and scheduled the sentencing for 11:00 AM on the 17th of this month.

### Yongyu Securities Company Card Game Gathering; Gold Bars and Stocks Piled on the Table; Police Arrive During Loud Calls; Twenty-Two Gamblers Arrested in One Sweep

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Yongyu Securities Company at No. 322 Jiujiang Road, Securities Building, was holding a card game gathering with huge stakes. The matter was learned by the Old Zha Gate Sub-bureau, which sent Deputy Chief Song and Criminal Section Chief Jiang Shangpei, leading many plainclothes police officers, into the company at 2:30 PM yesterday afternoon. Just as the gamblers were in high spirits, they were arrested in one fell swoop.

### The City's Tax Revenue is Severely Insufficient; Efforts to Reduce Unnecessary Expenditures; Mr. Gu Chunfan Talks to Reporters Yesterday; No Increase in Any Taxes is Currently Planned

[Our Newspaper's Report] Gu Chunfan, Director of the Finance Bureau, attended the National Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure System Conference in Beijing last week and has completed his work and returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday evening. Yesterday afternoon, Director Gu received a reporter from our newspaper and stated: The main resolution of this meeting is to revise the division of national and local taxes, which will be implemented from July 1st. The entire deed tax will be assigned to the local government, and the land tax will be collected by the local government, of which 60% will go to the local government. The inheritance tax will be collected by the central government, of which 15% will be assigned to the local government. The business tax will be collected directly by the central government, of which 70% will be allocated back to the local government.

In the past, the city's fiscal revenue and expenditure were severely insufficient. After the Executive Yuan subsidized a part of it, it could still be made up. However, starting from July, the Executive Yuan stipulated that it would no longer provide subsidies, and all funds would be raised locally, that is, from business, land, and deed taxes, etc., to increase revenue. However, it is currently unknown whether the amount of business tax collected will be sufficient to cover the subsidies. Furthermore, since the Executive Yuan approved the adjustment of salaries for civil servants and teachers in June, the deficit will be even greater. The central government only promised to be responsible for the national portion and subsidize 500 million yuan per month. Gu stated that the only way to deal with the emergency is to address the urgent needs first and delay the less urgent ones, and to reduce unnecessary expenditures as much as possible. In addition, the management of tax revenue will also be strictly enforced to prevent tax evasion. He also hopes that citizens will cooperate and report as much as possible. After verification, strict penalties will be imposed. Currently, no increase in any taxes is planned to avoid increasing the burden on the people. As for adjusting housing donations, it is temporarily not easy to implement, but a plan is being drafted.

Regarding the issuance of public bonds, Director Gu believes that there is no guarantee of purchasing power and does not plan to hold it. The public bonds issued by the former Municipal Council have not yet been fully cleared due to the council's busy affairs.

### Brother-in-Law Suddenly Starts a Conflict; Police Recklessly Open Fire

[Our Newspaper's Report] Xu Yulong, a vegetable vendor from the Central Market, lives on the third floor of No. 27 Jinling Road, Shunji Hat and Shoe Store. Two months ago, Xu's seven-year-old daughter, Meili, was tricked out by his brother-in-law, Li Afu, and there has been no news of her since. Unexpectedly, yesterday afternoon at about 1:00 PM, Li and a police officer (No. 1459) went to Xu's residence, falsely accusing Xu of stealing a bicycle and insisting on taking Xu away. A conflict arose between the two parties. At that time, Xu closed the door, which angered the police officer, who drew his gun and fired two shots to intimidate. Li took the opportunity to escape. As a result, the police officer was about to take Xu into the Huangpu Sub-bureau. Just as he went out the back door, in the back alley of Jianli Lane, for some unknown reason, the police officer fired another shot in the lane. A stray bullet hit Zhang Qingyuan, an apprentice at the Tongli Department Store, in the nose. The store owner reported the incident to the Huangpu Sub-bureau. After a preliminary investigation by Director Du, he believed that the police officer's arbitrary firing of a gun was inappropriate and ordered the police officer who caused the incident to be detained to investigate the case and handle it accordingly.

### A Teacher Turns Bandit: Fish Market Manager's Robbery Case Solved

[Our Newspaper's Report] Zhang Caizhang, a Ningbo native, forty-seven years old, and the manager of the Dahe Fish Company in the fish market, residing at No. 76 Yongfeng Lane, Sichuan North Road, was suddenly invaded by five bandits at 9:00 AM on the 3rd.

### Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau Utilizes Summer Vacation to Train Large Numbers of Elementary School Teachers, Improving Teacher Quality and Increasing Teaching Efficiency

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau will utilize the summer vacation to train a large number of elementary school teachers in the city, to study academics and strengthen their physique, thereby increasing teaching efficiency and actively promoting national education. Also, to help the unqualified elementary school teachers of this session, three training programs will be held starting in July. Here are the details of each program:

Cadre Summer Camp

(A) Shanghai Municipal National Education Cadre Summer Camp: The purpose of the camp's training is to: (1) Train national education cadres in the city in stages, so that they clearly understand the educational purpose of the Republic of China and the steps to implement national education, so as to become excellent cadres engaged in national education. (2) Train national education personnel in the city in stages, so that they acquire knowledge of constitutional construction and local autonomy, so as to become the backbone of local autonomy. This session's trainees are principals, directors, and cultural section directors of district public offices. The number of trainees is limited to 200. The training period is from July 29th to August 10th. The camp is located at the Central National School in Gaoqiao District, near the seaside with pleasant scenery, and lodging is available for trainees.

### Peiping to Establish Independent Engineering College; Ministry of Education Approves Lingda Fifth Branch's Request

[Special Dispatch from Beiping] Students of the Fifth Branch of Peiping Lingda held an autonomous association meeting on the 7th of this month to oppose the joint establishment of an engineering college by Peking University and Tsinghua University, demanding independence, which led to a strike. They invited the press at the time to report that the strike was completely forced and that its purpose was only to urge the education authorities to pay attention so that the problem could be resolved quickly. They also issued a declaration to compatriots nationwide, stating: (1) Oppose joint establishment and joint management, and otherwise, establish an independent engineering college, or let one school run it independently. (2) Director Chen Xueping originally promised to give a definite reply within a week, but two months have passed and there is still no solution. The students have endured again and again, and all the students have decided to start a strike from today until a satisfactory reply is received. On the 8th, they sent representatives to visit Mr. Li Zongren and relevant authorities, requesting an appeal. If there is no response, a general assembly of all students will be convened again to discuss the next step. It is now learned that the representatives of the Fifth Branch's autonomous association visited Director Chen Xueping again on the 9th to inquire about everything. Mr. Chen told them: The Ministry of Education has decided to withdraw its order and establish an independent and permanent engineering college.

### Elementary School Curriculum Research: A Reasonable Path for Elementary School Curriculum Standards

Revising the elementary school curriculum has become the focus of attention in all aspects. Elementary school education is the starting point of education and the foundation of knowledge for every future citizen; with a sound elementary school education and knowledge base, one can receive advanced knowledge and create an excellent citizen.

In the past, people generally neglected elementary school education, considering the sacred and important elementary school education to be insignificant. Now this wrong concept has been gradually corrected, and everyone recognizes the importance of elementary school education. It is the cradle of knowledge for every citizen and the nanny who instills basic education in children.

Our country's education has never had reasonable standards, especially elementary school. Each school sets its own curriculum, which varies widely in content and difficulty. Students in the same grade have different levels of proficiency due to the different schools they attend. If this continues, the academic abilities of students in middle school and university will never be equal, and no definite standard can be found. Therefore, revising the elementary school curriculum standards is a matter of great urgency.

But what is the standard for the elementary school curriculum? The relationship is too great and should be decided after careful research in all aspects. The scope of this research is quite extensive. I believe that a detailed analysis and observation of children's physical strength, intelligence, psychology, experience, and the knowledge they actually need to gain in the six years of elementary school must be carried out before a concrete decision can be made and implemented.

Nowadays, the age of admission for most children is earlier than in the past, averaging around six years old. The earliest is five years old in Chinese age at admission, so the age is young, like a tender seedling just sprouting from a branch, and the intelligence is naturally very weak. The curriculum at this time must be simplified as much as possible. I believe that the responsibility of educating children in the first and second grades of elementary school only needs to achieve the following points: (1) To enlighten children's thoughts, from scattered to concentrated. (2) To arouse children's desire for knowledge and interest in the curriculum. (3) To make children know the most basic common sense, counting, and etiquette.

When children's thoughts are concentrated, the foundation is solid, and they gradually become interested in the education they receive, then increase and deepen the subjects reasonably step by step from the third grade. However, this increase and deepening must be suitable for children's physical strength and intelligence so that they can accept and digest it without causing adverse reactions such as malnutrition.

I am not from the Department of Education, nor am I an expert in researching educational issues, but I feel the seriousness of this issue and the adverse consequences caused by unreasonable courses in the past. I think that there are thousands of future citizens groaning under the lash of this unreasonable curriculum, waiting to be rescued. I am also a member of the people, and my children will grow up and be sent to school for education. I cannot watch this curriculum standard remain unreasonable forever without reforming it. I have written this article based on my limited views for the reference of those responsible for revising the elementary school curriculum standards. (Gao Wuhong, 35, 6, 11, in Wuxi)

### Today's Big Football Match: Visiting Team Faces Formidable Opponent - Star Eastern League to Face Eastern China - 5:30 PM at Recreation Ground - Whether it Can Proceed Depends on the Weather

The Hong Kong Star Eastern Football League team, on a tour to Shanghai, has achieved victories in all three matches, successively defeating foreign teams such as the British Navy, Western League, and Jewish team. Today, in their fourth match, they will face their first formidable opponent. They will battle Eastern China at the Recreation Ground at 5:30 PM. Tickets remain the same price and will be available for sale starting at 3:00 PM at 303 South Shaanxi Road. The referee is Deng Xiaoliang, and the linesmen are He Chunhui and Huang Renyi.

Lineups of Both Sides

Regarding the lineup for Star Eastern today, arranged by Xu Jingcheng, Guo Yingqi and Feng Shengkun will temporarily take a short rest. The left wing belongs to Li Shuoyou, Liu Songsheng will temporarily fill the right forward position, and the rest remain unchanged. The visiting team risked trying a new formation the other day, almost falling victim to the Jewish team. Therefore, today they have decided to fight with a reasonable formation. Shuoyou's performance lately has been strong, and he should be able to handle this position happily. Songsheng's guest appearance as a forward should also not be disappointing.

The lineup for Eastern China has also been announced. Goalkeeper Zhang Banglun is in good condition, firmly guarding his position. Ling Sheng shifts to left inside forward, with Tian Zheng Yingquan taking over as right forward. Fu Zhen and Long Bo in the center back line appear quite strong. In the five-forward formation, A-Sun on the right is doubtful, with Ling Sheng replacing the left, which is also ideal. With such a formation, the defense is solid, and the forwards are sharp. Moreover, A-Sun's footwork is experienced and skillful, shooting left and right as he pleases. Assisted by Ling Sheng, they will pose a serious threat to the visiting team.

Furthermore, according to the Football Committee: due to yesterday's heavy rain, whether the field can be used for the match today, please call 70099 at the Municipal Stadium to inquire. If the match cannot be played today, it will be postponed to the next day.

Today's Outcome

Today, the Star Eastern League team will play against the strong Eastern China team in this city. Opinions on the outcome vary. Some say Star Eastern will definitely win, while others say Eastern China also has a chance. Those who say Star Eastern will definitely win base their judgment on Star Eastern's three consecutive victories and their performance on the field, their crisp footwork, and their skilled teamwork. Those who favor Star Eastern's victory represent the majority. Looking at the lineup arranged for Eastern China today, it is still considered well-organized. Veteran generals and elite troops are also not weak, and the outcome will depend on luck. Each will fight for their reputation, making a great battle certain.

### Market Freight Registration Declines Sharply - Rice Prices Form Another Stalemate

Mayor Wu Personally Speaks at the Market - Transaction Prices Must Be Based on the Previous Day

Mayor Wu personally went to the rice market yesterday morning to give an important speech to the rice merchants, roughly stating: (1) Resolutely crack down on rice merchants who collude to speculate and hoard rice. Market transaction prices should be based on the market prices of the previous day and should not be raised. The city currently needs more than 7,000 dan of rice per day. If the goods do not arrive in sufficient quantity, registered rice merchants will be allowed to supplement them. (2) Rice shops are allowed to purchase from the market according to the actual amount of rice they sell, but they are not allowed to purchase more to prevent hoarding. In terms of price, they are allowed to add a 6% profit margin and transportation costs to the purchase price from the market, and no additional charges are allowed. In addition, an invoice must be provided when selling.

The rice market opened with increased volume yesterday, and most legitimate rice merchants were able to follow the authorities' instructions and trade normally. However, black-hearted speculative profiteers are still operating secretly, so the registration of goods at the market has decreased. Yesterday, the original inventory of goods in each stall did not change, but 100 yuan fell by 500 yuan. Yesterday's registration of goods was only 2,877 shi, including 903 shi of white japonica rice, 564 shi of thin indica rice, 340 shi of sheep glutinous rice, 71 shi of Du indica rice, and 999 shi of weed indica rice. Flour rose early and fell in the afternoon, eventually closing weakly. Corn remained scarce, the red grain market was sluggish, the new wheat from Ningbo was moving but not booming, and the trend was firm. The turnover of old wheat was average, and prices were fair. Soybeans also showed little fluctuation, raw peanuts were dull, and they returned by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. The supply of broad beans was abundant, and the price fell by more than 1,000 yuan. Bean cakes were not selling well, and the supply exceeded demand, falling by 100 to 200 yuan. Wheat bran rose by 100 to 200 yuan, and oil prices rose by several hundred to 1,000 yuan.

Jia Yi rose by 550 yuan, and Ding Wu rose sharply by 700 yuan.

### Little Transaction in the Yarn Market - Spot Cotton Market Firm

The yarn market was firm and then flat yesterday. In the early morning, the Guangdong clique still had some appetite, and Shuangma was once called up to 1.34 million, but because there were many sellers, it returned to 1.315 million yuan. The other yarn counts were very mediocre, and there were not many transactions. The supply of spot goods was also not abundant, temporarily entering a hovering situation, and people's minds were very indifferent.

Yesterday, New York American cotton telegrams suddenly soared by 25 to 41 pounds, with the recent price of American dollars being 29.05, the forward price being 29.44, and the Meitlin spot price being 29.82.

### Factory-Managed Silk Goods Decline Slightly - Rayon Prices Rise

Yesterday in the rayon market, in the morning, the opening price of Zhongfang's goods was 40,000 to 50,000 yuan lower than the afternoon of the previous day due to the date of Zhongfang's opening. Later, it was learned that Zhongfang's opening price was 70,000 to 80,000 yuan higher than the previous period, so it rebounded unanimously. No. 120 Tianqiao opened at 1.39 million yuan and closed at 420,000 yuan. In the afternoon, it traded at 445,000 yuan, which was 10,000 yuan higher than the price of the previous day.

Due to the slight decline in gold prices, buyers in the factory-managed market were hesitant, and the market was quiet. No. 745 averaged 2.02 million yuan. There were no transactions in user silk and dry warp, and the quoted prices were slightly weak. Silk goods also declined yesterday. The quoted price for American Asia bedding was 40,000 to 50,000 yuan lower, but no transactions were made.

### Tea Prices Gradually Improving

The turnover of red and green tea varieties in local shops and guest gangs has been good recently, especially for medium and low-end black tea. The buying interest in Suzhou and surrounding areas is increasing, and suppliers are taking the opportunity to raise prices. As a result, the prices of all varieties are gradually improving, and other varieties are showing signs of firmness. As for the foreign tea market, according to industry news, although there is demand in Africa, Morocco, and other places, there is no prospect of expanding customs clearance. The Anhui Tea Company in Shanghai is actively seeking development in the UK and US.

### Vegetable Oil Factory Continues to Allocate Edible Oil

The Chinese Vegetable Oil Factory continued to allocate edible oil yesterday, following the same method as in the past.

Yesterday, 200 barrels were allocated, each barrel containing 350 market catties, at 59,000 yuan per 100 market catties.

### Cloth Market Calm

Customer gang purchases were not as strong as the previous day. Because of the date that Zhongfang had opened sales, most buyers were holding a wait-and-see attitude. Generally, retail investors had a slight selling out, making the market even more calm. The number of V-dragonhead fine cloths in particular was tight, and the dyeing factory side had a slight need for them, so they rose a thousand yuan uniquely. The remaining majority had little to no fluctuation. At noon, Zhongfang listed the V-dragonhead without any supply. A 12-pound 3A colored ball cloth was 51,000 yuan, rising 500 yuan from the previous period. The other prices were unchanged.

List of Shareholders' Meeting Dates

Gold Market Hot Money Shifts - Hua Shares and Yongsha Alone Stand Out

Hua shares had gold hot money returning. A major investor surnamed Zhu raised funds to pull up Yongsha. Retail investors followed suit, with the capable buying Yongsha and the incapable engaging in hedging. As a result, small shares were the first to bear the brunt, so that except for Yongsha galloping alone, the rest lagged far behind. Yongsha's low price in the early morning was 5,900 yuan, and it closed at a high price. The lowest price for Mei Ya mid-way was 4,360 yuan, and the highest was 4,600 yuan. Jingfu rose by 310 yuan, falling to 290 yuan at the low. Xinguang retreated from 305 yuan to 285 yuan. Qinxing also retreated from a high price of 233 yuan to 218 yuan. At the final turnover, Yongsha alone rose by nearly 10%. Although Mei Ya rose, it was very slight. The small shares Jingfu and Xinguang fell slightly, and Qinxing rose slightly. The unpopular small and medium-sized and veteran shares were flat. Yong'an Company has a plan to give nine as a gift to one, which some people are interested in, and the quoted price rose.

### Coal Market Soft

In the coal market, white coal prices are still experiencing scattered transactions amidst weakness. Since the decline in bituminous coal prices the day before yesterday, the market still feels unable to support itself. Importers are temporarily stagnant due to factory sales, rumors have not subsided, buying interest is slack, and there are still many people selling off their holdings. Although prices have not continued to decline, the foundation is soft.

### Hong Kong Caustic Soda to Arrive

The price of caustic soda in this city has been soaring for the past week. The reason for this is that the United States has banned exports, and the tendency of foreign traders to come to Shanghai to purchase has caused merchants to prosper. It is said that the supply of caustic soda in Shanghai is not very weak, and there is a large stock of American caustic soda in Hong Kong that has nowhere to go. The price per barrel is around 200,000. If the price in Shanghai rises, the goods from Hong Kong will inevitably arrive continuously. It is said that the first batch of about 1,000 tons will be shipped to Shanghai soon. Shanghai merchants, after hearing this, intend to start selling 15-day futures within the day, so the price of caustic soda should be able to recover soon.

### Jinshan Longan Price Slightly Relaxed

Jinshan dried longan has recently arrived in small quantities. Yesterday, dozens of boxes were offered by dealers in the northern market, with the higher price being 380,000 yuan and the lower price being 286,000 yuan. Hainan dried longan was 100,000 yuan.

### Gold Price Continues to Decline by 45,000 - US Dollar Plummets - Down 130 Yuan Compared to the Previous Close

Yesterday, gold prices plummeted because news reported that the central government was fully suppressing gold prices, determined not to allow them to continue rising, and was strictly managing US dollars. Many people saw the situation was not good and closed their positions. After opening at 1.9 million in the morning, it gradually fell to 1.865 million, and then slightly stabilized. The Bank of China allocated the registered 128 dealers at a price of 1.87 million. After the allocation, it slightly rose to above 1.88 million, but pressure increased again, and it fell back to 1.855 million at noon. The market was flat and weak in the early afternoon. After 2:00 PM, the price for next-day delivery rose slightly. As a result, it closed down 45,000 yuan compared to the previous close. Silver jewelry was also reduced to 198,000. Silver bullion did not change, still hanging at 2,200. Silver dollars were slightly lower, with 13,803 being sold. Hidden short-term interest rates were still flat, ranging from 1.2 to 1.5 cents.

Sellers surged, and the price dropped to below 2,550 yuan before briefly catching its breath, rising slightly to 2,580 yuan. At noon, it was still downstream, squatting below 2,550 yuan.

(Another Report) According to an authoritative source from the Shangrong Bank: After restrictions were imposed on remittances to the mainland, it is currently impossible to statistically track domestic exchange rates. Larger remittances are flowing into the black market, as the exchange rate is lower, the procedures are simpler, and there are no restrictions. It is only necessary to purchase checks from local banks and stores, or exchange goods for funds. Therefore, recently, commercial banks in this city have been able to receive very few large remittances.

As for exchange rates, commercial banks have slightly different rates. For example, the lowest rate is in Tianjin for Kunming, Chongqing, and Ping, where 950 yuan in Shanghai can be exchanged for 1,000 yuan in Tianjin.

### Changchun After the Calamity Revives

Dispatch from our Changchun Bureau, 3rd by Airmail

It has been over ten days since the National Army entered Changchun. In these ten days, Changchun has gradually returned to normal. A refreshing breeze, typical of early summer, has begun to blow here, soothing the people. The cessation of hostilities and the change of seasons have brought great comfort to the sorrowful.

Garrison Commander General Liao Yaoxiang and Deputy Commander General Shu Shucun officially took office on the 28th. Acting Mayor of Changchun Shang Chuandao, accompanied by Secretary-General Liu Shougang and others, also arrived on the 29th to take charge. Other government organs have been established one after another, while others are in preparation.

Order has been gradually restored, and by the beginning of this month, stability was largely achieved. Groups of citizens are cleaning the streets, clearing away broken bricks, rubble, and other obstacles, their faces revealing joy as they busily engage in preliminary reconstruction work.

The electricity, which had been cut off after the Communist troops withdrew, plunged everyone into darkness. Fortunately, after a brief two-day period, the lights shone brightly again. The radio station also began broadcasting news, Peking opera, and popular songs day and night.

At first, only small grocery stores were open for business. Later, one major store after another opened its doors. At the same time, each store was busy unearthing and moving back the goods that had been dispersed and buried, rearranging them, and erecting neon lights. Most of the customers in the stores are soldiers, and the restaurants are also filled with soldiers eating and drinking. Everyone believes that the soldiers, who have worked hard for so long, deserve some enjoyment.

The number of vehicles and horses on the streets is increasing day by day. Trolley cars are also running. The people seem to have awakened from a nightmare and are beginning to become active on the streets. Slogans of "Welcome the National Army" and "Long Live Chairman Chiang" are plastered all over the streets and alleys. It seems that the city of Changchun is bustling again.

Prices are currently much lower than in Shenyang, especially for food. Rice is 22 yuan per catty, sorghum is 7 yuan per catty, and pork is 25 yuan per catty—each Northeast circulating note is worth 13 national currency yuan. Vegetables and other items are also cheap. General merchandise is also cheaper than in Shenyang. If there is no manipulation or hoarding, and if there are no transportation problems, a period of low prices can be maintained.

The Japanese in Changchun did not suffer any damage when the Communist troops occupied Changchun. Now that they have hope of returning to their country, there are even more vendors selling clothes and miscellaneous goods in the former "Yoshino-cho" and "Yamato-dori" areas. The narrow streets are crowded with people buying and selling goods. The noisy and bustling scene is just like "Kasuga-cho" and "Aoba-cho" in Shenyang. The largest department store, "Hakuryu," formerly "Mitsui," is still controlled by the Japanese. The best residences are still occupied by the Japanese. The authorities are already drafting plans to regulate and suppress this situation.

### The Advance and Retreat of the National and Communist Armies

After the liberation of the Northeast, Changchun reverted to its original name from the puppet name "Shinkyo." Personnel dispatched by the central government, Allied Soviet troops, and the people of Changchun lived together for more than eight months. Although there were some ups and downs and anxieties in between, they finally passed in an atmosphere of friendship.

In early April, the Soviet troops in Changchun began to withdraw. By noon on the 12th, the withdrawal was complete. From the start of the Soviet withdrawal, the atmosphere in the city gradually became tense, eventually leading to panic, due to the continuous arrival of Communist troops.

Communist troops arrived by train in the area north of Changchun, including Wanbaoshan, Buhai Station, and Yijianbao. In the east, Communist troops arrived from Jilin in the areas of Chaluhe, Yinmahe, and Lalatun. In the south, they arrived from Yitong in the areas of Hejiatun and Weizigou. In the west, they reached Baichengzi, thus forming an encirclement.

At 8 p.m. on April 12, the Communist troops began their attack. The siege began, and smoke and bullets filled the entire city of Changchun. The news spread throughout China and abroad. By the 18th, the government's isolated troops, without external support, ran out of ammunition and suffered casualties. They retreated and ceased resistance. Changchun then fell into the hands of the Communist troops.

The airport, the puppet State Council, the new imperial palace, the Ministry of Transportation, the Ministry of People's Livelihood, the East Bridge, South Street, Dama Road, Xi'an Bridge, the museum, the telegraph office, the Daxing Company, and the Kangde Hall all became contested strongholds and battlefields. Buildings were destroyed, and public and private lives and property suffered unprecedented damage.

The Communist troops entered Changchun on April 19 and withdrew on May 23. During their time in Changchun, they were busy with "liquidation" and "meetings." When they withdrew, they carried out a round of destruction. When the National Army attacked and entered, Changchun returned to the embrace of the central government. The chaos and unrest came to an end.

### Questions Regarding Housing Allocation

Editor: The newspaper reported, "Mayor Wu told reporters: The principle of housing allocation, based on Chairman Chiang's handwritten guidelines in Nanjing, is that no more than two rooms may be occupied by five or more people, and no more than three rooms may be occupied by six or more people, and the principle of releasing houses." After reading this, I deeply admire it. However, the meaning of the principle is implicit, leading to many rumors recently. I have four questions: (1) Does the principle, "no more than four rooms for six or more people," refer to one household, or can eight rooms be occupied by twelve or more people, and so on? (2) In Shanghai's public housing, it is rare for five people to be able to live in three rooms. The practice of privately transferring housing for a gold bar has been strictly prohibited. Since this is a matter of mutual consent, who would report it? The prohibition exists only on paper. However, as a result, those without houses still have houses to live in, while those with houses have already transferred them privately and voluntarily live in crowded conditions. It seems unnecessary to limit the number of rooms and people. (3) The principle is certainly for both officials and civilians, but will it be strictly followed for the residences of high-ranking officials and superiors? (4) The report states that the allocation of housing for administrative Yuan organs in the future will be based on this principle. Does this refer to the allocation of various houses received this time to various organs, and is it unrelated to civilian rentals and self-built houses? Leading by example and treating others as oneself is called "forgiveness," and equality under the law should be observed by both superiors and subordinates. If the government, except for office buildings and Chairman Chiang's private residence, makes an exception and distributes the remaining houses of special-appointment officials to officials of equal or simplified rank, and so on from top to bottom, then there will be no housing shortage for the people. Taking Shanghai as an example, how many thousands of houses were received from Japanese officials and merchants, as well as Japanese and German expatriates and puppet residences? Who lives in them now? Has there been any allocation? If the mayor leads by example and strictly orders his subordinates to rent out all remaining houses, will it be possible to do so for the residences of important figures? Reader Zhang Fumin, June 7.

### The Pitiful Primary School Teachers of Changshu!

Editor: Apart from Shanghai, the cultural center, Changshu was known before the war as the county with the most universal education and the most developed culture in the entire Jiangsu Province. Its cultural development and universal education were certainly due in part to the stability of life and the excellent environment. But the most important factor that cannot be ignored is that the middle and primary school teachers in Changshu County were mostly local people who were enthusiastic about local education. Due to the enthusiasm and efforts of local teachers running local education, students' academic performance undoubtedly improved rapidly.

But let us observe the current state of education and culture in Changshu County today. It lags behind like its ancient city walls. Compared with students in other places, it is questionable whether their grades can maintain a balance. We believe that a teacher's enthusiasm for teaching has a direct and significant impact on students' academic performance. If teachers are worried about rice and firewood all day long, and their stomachs are constantly rumbling, the academic performance of the children they educate can be left unspoken.

Now, a movement to respect teachers is being launched everywhere, surging like a tidal wave, with basketball charity games and radio speeches. We are truly envious because we see that teachers in other places can have considerable solutions. But let us observe the teachers of Changshu County. They are still tightening their belts, enduring hunger, and sticking to their posts. Who will initiate a respect-for-teachers movement? And who will be solicited for donations? Although the county education department has irresponsibly instructed schools to solicit donations from students, is this a good way to popularize education? Is this a fundamental method of solving teachers' hunger? Is this what teachers who run local education want to do? We would rather starve to death than ask students for a single penny!

I recently saw in the newspaper a disclosure of the provincial government's order that, due to frequent changes in the price index, the county government should pay civil servants' monthly salaries on a monthly basis and should not arbitrarily delay payment. At first, I was overjoyed, but who knew that the salary we received this time was still "half a month's salary advanced from April"! It is already late May and early June, and we are still "advancing" the salary for April. How should the word "advance" be interpreted? Is it possible for us to take this meager tens of thousands of yuan salary and support our families and children?

The adverse consequences of this situation are that qualified teachers in the area are leaving to teach elsewhere or seek other livelihoods. The remaining teachers are either perfunctory or incapable and unqualified, temporarily stopping by. But if we ask these teachers to educate our next generation, how terrible is its impact!

We cannot bear to witness the collapse of the education system in Changshu County, so we loudly appeal to all enthusiastic people in the community: Save the primary school teachers of Changshu County who are struggling in adverse environments and on the hunger line, save the declining education system of Changshu County! Respectfully submitted by a group of Changshu County primary school teachers, Miao Weimin, Zhu Baoshu, Huang Runan, Ji Manyun, and others.

### Heading Towards the Road to Revival

The Changchun municipal government building has been burned down. Mayor Zhao Junmai has been taken away by the Communist troops. The new acting mayor, Shang Chuandao, is temporarily using the former "Chong Electric Power Company" as the new government site. This spacious building has no doors, windows, tables, or chairs. The new mayor and his subordinates are carrying out their work in this incomplete shell.

The "Mantetsu" building, formerly the location of the Northeast Headquarters, has been burned to the ground. Now, only the remaining shell supports the remnants. The Central Bank was also destroyed by artillery fire. The vault, once known as the best in East Asia, has been destroyed. It is said that the Communist troops put great effort into destroying this vault. In the end, they gathered Japanese technicians, used gas fire to drill small holes in the vault, and planted explosives to destroy it. The municipal government, the police department, the former Kwantung Army headquarters, and the puppet imperial palace have all been reduced to rubble.

The widest road in the city, the old Datong Street area, is littered with heartbreaking and tragic remains. The scene inside and outside the train station is even more desolate. Trains lie on the tracks. The scene of bustling traffic and pedestrians that once existed no longer exists today.

Powerful journalists have all rushed to Changchun like a race, and they are competing like wrestling for houses and equipment. The competition has become white-hot. From the perspective of journalistic spirit, this is commendable, and they have made the utmost effort. From another perspective, some say that this is an unreasonable phenomenon because there is no overall planning and distribution plan.

The first to publish was the "Forward Daily," which took over the puppet "Kangde News" and began publishing less than a week after the National Army entered Changchun, on May 28. This was followed by the "New Life News," "Dahua Daily," "Changchun Daily," "Youth Daily," and "Northeast People's Daily," a total of six newspapers. There are still five or six more in preparation for publication, some of whom are "laying down their guns to pick up their pens."

During the puppet Manchukuo era, Changchun had only two newspapers, "Kangde News" and "Manchukuo-Chosen Daily." Now, it has developed rapidly. Naturally, there are uneven distribution and lack of equipment and facilities. The order of arrival and the presence or absence of power have been fully and clearly demonstrated today. The atmosphere of everyone competing to run newspapers is very tense here!

The National Army has stationed in Changchun. Receiving personnel, administrative officials, and technical personnel are arriving one after another on the road from Shenyang to Changchun. The 800,000 people of Changchun are also looking forward to assisting these personnel who have arrived and have not yet arrived. At the same time, they hope that there will be no more chaotic reception phenomena like those in other places. Although there are already some places that do not quite comply with the regulations, they hope that this will stop here and that Changchun will soon embark on the road of revival and construction!

### Eastern Monte Carlo: Recent Developments in Macau

Dispatch from our Hong Kong Bureau, 1st by Airmail. Special Correspondent Lin Youlan

Reuters suddenly sent a message from Lisbon, Portugal, on May 22, stating that, according to reliable sources, the United States is currently negotiating with Portugal to establish an air base in Portuguese Macau, outside the Pearl River estuary. As early as May 8, the Macau Chinese-language newspaper *Hua Qiao Bao* reported that "Pan American Airlines of the United States had set up a branch office in Macau and established an airplane landing field in the nearby waters to facilitate the Far East air route. With the outbreak of the Pacific War, it was suspended.

Small Area to Become an Air Station

After the end of the war, Pan American actively resumed operations and has successively restored air stations in Singapore, Manila, and other places. The Macau side is also planning. Recently, the old matter was brought up again, and personnel were sent to Macau to handle everything. The construction of an airport in Macau will be announced and realized." Macau, a small area, may soon become one of the world's air stations. Taking this opportunity, I will briefly describe recent events in Macau, hoping that the Chinese people will not completely ignore this small peninsula at the southernmost tip of the Pearl River Delta.

Not long ago, the gambling king of Macau, Fu Deyin (also known as Fu Laorong), was kidnapped by bandits in a temple and demanded 100 catties of gold as ransom. This news spread throughout Guangdong and Hong Kong. Fu Laorong and Gao Kening's Tai Hing General Company contracted all of Macau's casinos and entertainment businesses (including hotels, restaurants, and dance halls). He is nothing less than the "Tsar" of this "Eastern Monte Carlo." In today's world, where there is a universal ban on opium and gambling, Macau is a city where opium dens and gambling houses can openly operate, and local government expenses come from opium taxes and gambling revenue—a center for creating evil and destroying civilization.

Before the War, Hong Kong Residents Went to Macau to Gamble on Weekends

It is only a four-hour boat ride from Hong Kong to Macau. Before the war, Macau was the most ideal weekend destination for Hong Kong people. In Hong Kong, boats departed for Macau at 8 a.m. and 2 p.m. every day. From Macau back to Hong Kong, in addition to the two boats in the morning and afternoon, there was also a midnight boat, departing at 2 a.m. and arriving in the early morning, which was perfect for pleasure-seekers and those looking to get drunk. If you placed a considerable number of bets in the casino, they would prepare a first-class ticket back to Hong Kong, so that even if you lost all your money, you would not be stranded in a foreign land, sighing at the sea. Now, the people of Hong Kong and Guangzhou are so pressed for survival that how many still have the leisure to go to Macau to spend extravagantly!

People Gone, Buildings Empty: Peach Blossom Spring Culture Becomes a Deserted Island

Macau has encountered a serious economic downturn. What has deepened the economic downturn in Macau in particular is the large-scale repatriation of refugees from the wartime. The current population remaining in Macau is more than 100,000. During the war, Macau, like Lisbon, hung up the signboard of neutrality, and fortunately escaped the baptism of artillery fire. People from Hong Kong and Guangdong flocked to seek refuge, and Macau became a utopia. But good times do not last long, and now people are gone and buildings are empty, and the city is desolate. If Hong Kong were not overcrowded and Guangzhou were not suffering from famine and epidemics at the same time.

Macau can be said to have no commerce, and its only industry cannot escape its fate. The cement factory has long been shut down due to a lack of raw materials. Matches and cigarettes, for a time, sold well in Guangdong and Hong Kong. But recently, American matches and cigarettes have flooded in, and the market price is not more expensive than Macau goods. Macau goods are gradually being eliminated. The value of Macau currency issued by Banco Nacional Ultramarino is similar to that of Hong Kong currency, with a difference of no more than 2%. Macau currency and Hong Kong currency are inextricably linked. The subtle political relationship between Hong Kong and Macau is also reflected in this economic proximity.

Suppressing National Currency: Travelers Suffer Innocently

Relying on the remaining power of its "supreme master," the Macau government has always shown a hideous and hateful face to our country's military and civilians. Before the war, the Macau authorities expressly forbade our army from setting foot in Macau. A small squad of black-faced troops from Portuguese East Africa, stationed at the Guanzha border between China and Portugal, arbitrarily arrested Chinese people in military uniforms crossing the border. There was even a time when even civil servants and students wearing Zhongshan suits were subjected to their humiliation. In schools, our students were forced to learn Portuguese. The unreasonable persecution of local residents by the Portuguese authorities under the power of the Japanese is especially unforgettable. The extraordinary measures for postal, telegraphic, and news censorship implemented in 1943 have not yet been abolished. Recently, it has also promulgated a restriction that travelers are not allowed to bring more than 50,000 yuan of national currency into the country, and countless travelers coming and going have suffered innocently. After the local chamber of commerce made many requests to the Governor of Macau, Teixeira de Sousa, the limit was increased to 500,000 yuan. This is obviously a measure to suppress the national currency and maintain the Macau currency, which has no reserve funds—even Hong Kong, which is directly ruled by the British, does not treat us so harshly!

Portuguese Infringement of Rights: Our Country Should Make a Statement

Macau was leased by our government to the Portuguese in 1557 (during the Ming Jiajing period) as a place for ships to sail in the Far East, opening the floodgates for foreigners to establish concession areas within our national territory. At that time, it was stipulated that the Portuguese should pay an annual land rent of 500 taels, and the area was limited to Guanqian Street and Sanba Gate (see *Yi Wu Shi Mo*, volume 27). According to the charter, China was entitled to establish officials and collect customs duties in Macau, and it was declared that it could not be transferred to others. However, over time, the rent was not paid, and taking advantage of our country's turbulent times, they gradually expanded their borders. All the lands along the Dutch Garden, Wangxia, and even Guanzha were occupied by the Portuguese outside the charter. There was a time when the Portuguese's greed could not be satisfied, and they even crossed into Wan Chai and Liang Keng (belonging to Zhongshan County) on the opposite bank of Macau, wanting to occupy them as their own. Whether Coloane, where Pan American Airlines plans to build an air base, faces our Hengqin Island, is Portuguese territory remains to be verified. The Portuguese government, regardless of everything, negotiated with the United States in Lisbon, disregarding our country's sovereignty. Regarding this point, our diplomatic authorities seem to need to make a formal statement to the United States.

Returning the Land by a Deadline is Just and Reasonable

We want to recover lost territory, and we also want to recover Macau, removing the stain on our territory. After Japan surrendered last year, the opinion circles of the wartime capital advocated that our authorities first recover Macau, because there is very little contact between China and Portugal in peacetime, and the Portuguese have no vested interests in the Far East. In our efforts to strengthen governance and vigorously renovate today, if the Portuguese respect our country's sovereignty, they should return Macau without us even having to open our mouths. How could the Portuguese still be attached to the dreams of the past, pretending to be powerful, and becoming more and more aggressive, disregarding our good intentions or friendship? Although the government now has tasks that are many times more important than recovering Macau that need to be completed, it is easy to set a deadline for the return of this small area of six square miles, which is just and reasonable. In Hong Kong, British intellectuals have revealed that they will return it immediately to promote Sino-British friendship, and the London officials who understand the overall situation have also revealed that they will reform the political system and grant autonomy. But what is Portugal? In other people's pure land, it opens opium and gambling, destroys civilization, and violates international law. Not only does it not show any remorse, but it is arrogant and aggressive, and reverses the roles of host and guest. We love peace and value friendship, but we should not be too tolerant of petty villains, because the repercussions will only allow conspirators to be unscrupulous and take an inch and want a mile.

Macau is located at the mouth of the Pearl River and stands side by side with Guangzhou and Hong Kong. It is 40 miles east of Hong Kong and 100 miles north of Guangzhou. It belongs to Zhongshan County and is about 30 miles from Dr. Sun Yat-sen's hometown of Cuiheng Village. It has a wide waterway leading to Jiangmen and Sanbu, which is more convenient for transportation in the upper reaches of the West River than Guangzhou. Traveling west along the coast to Guangzhou Bay (now renamed Zhanjiang City), which was recovered after the war, merchants from both places have frequent exchanges.

### Increased Birth Rate After Demobilization of British Army; Frequent Divorce Cases of Soldiers

This newspaper's London dispatch, dated the 2nd, special correspondent Xueyan.

Along with all the demobilization announcements in Britain, there is also a "demobilization" of births. The return of soldiers from the front lines and the reunion of families have naturally led to an increase in infant births. However, the problem is that the population registration this spring indicates an unexpected increase of 17,000 births compared to expectations. Based on this trend, it is estimated that there will be 40,000 more births in the summer, making this unexpected increase a serious problem. The primary concern is the shortage of midwives, followed by the inadequacy of equipment in maternity hospitals to meet the needs. The Minister of Health, Mr. Bevan, has appealed to local authorities to make every effort to assist pregnant women. Needless to say, the salaries of midwives and those working in maternity hospitals will be increased. Every effort will be made to facilitate external midwives who are willing to work, and those who have changed professions will be assisted in returning to their original jobs. In addition, some Red Cross nurses have already been transferred to maternity hospitals. With these efforts by the Ministry of Health, the summer problem is expected to be resolved.

In Britain, if three people are buying the same item at the same time, they have to queue. This was the case during the war because the number of shop assistants decreased and the queues became longer. Now that the war has ended for a year, people want to know if the queuing situation has improved. A public opinion survey will be conducted in England, Scotland, and Wales in mid-May, asking: "Based on your personal experience, is the time you spend queuing to buy anything now more or less than a year ago?" In the answers, 31% said more, 36% said the same, 19% said less, and 14% said they didn't know. However, in Britain, most people who go out to buy things are women, so the answers from women may be more accurate. To the same question, the answers from women only were: 38% said more, 35% said the same, 20% said less, and 7% said they didn't know. From this, it seems that the time spent queuing is longer, or at least those who say they need less time are in the minority.

### The Problem of Demobilization of Polish Soldiers: A New Burden for Britain

During this war, about 500,000 Polish soldiers participated in the war against Germany and Italy under the leadership of the Polish government-in-exile in London. Regardless of their political views, these people have all served the Allied countries. Because the Polish government-in-exile was based in Britain and mainly supported by Britain, Britain is in the best position to appreciate their contributions. However, as a result of the Yalta Conference, the Polish government in London must merge with the people's government in Poland, which means that the Polish government-in-exile loses its basis for existence. Therefore, its leadership of the 500,000 soldiers also suffers from the difficulty of not knowing who to follow. During the war, they were incorporated into the British and American armies, receiving wages for their service, so the problem was not serious. Now that the war has long ended and the soldiers are busy demobilizing, where these Polish soldiers should go has become a serious problem. Logically, they can naturally return to Poland, but we know that the current Polish government is similar to the Soviet Union. These soldiers, trained by Britain and the United States, feel incompatible and mostly express their unwillingness to return. In addition, this February, the Polish government announced that if these soldiers wish to return to their country, they should not disband their troops and return individually in order to be properly resettled, which makes them even more uneasy. Fortunately, the British government strongly supports them. When discussing refugee relief at the United Nations General Assembly, Britain insisted that anyone who is unwilling to return to their country due to different political views should also be regarded as refugees for relief. The Soviet Union and Poland strongly opposed this, and both sides clearly realized the problem of the demobilized Polish soldiers. It is estimated that most of these 500,000 people are now in Germany, accounting for about three-fifths of the total, followed by Italy, with more than 100,000, and Britain, with about 40,000 to 50,000. Now, the Polish army in Italy has begun to disband. Only 3,000 people are willing to return to Poland individually under the conditions offered by the current Polish government to re-establish their livelihoods. The remaining 110,000 will be transported to Britain, becoming a new burden for the British government. The British government has promised them to do its best to resettle them and help them re-establish their livelihoods. For example, it will negotiate with various autonomous territories and South American countries that still have room for immigration, asking them to accommodate some of them. The rest will also be found jobs in Britain and mainland Europe. It is said that prisoner-of-war camps and coal mines still need people, so it should be possible to resettle some of them. Before finding suitable jobs, these demobilized Polish soldiers will temporarily remain in military camps awaiting orders and receiving salaries, but wartime allowances will be cancelled. However, the biggest problem in the future is still the Polish people in Germany, because there are too many of them, and it may be more difficult to find a way out.

### Social Services: Answering Readers' Questions

Legal Inquiries

(1) Yu Lianying asks: I am an orphaned girl, living with my uncle's family. I call my aunt and uncle parents. Later, my uncle passed away, and I lived with my cousin's family. I am responsible for all the housework, laundry, cooking, and everything else. Later, my family believed in astrology and said that I had a hard and bitter fate, and that I should marry an older man and be his second wife. Therefore, a matchmaker was arranged, and I was engaged to a Mr. X, who is 38 years old, 16 years older than me, and has been married twice before. At that time, if I didn't agree, I would not be tolerated in my uncle's house, and my mother would not dare to take me back home. Forced by circumstances, I got engaged at the end of last year. I have several questions and would like to ask for guidance: (1) I am 22 years old, do I have the right to make my own marriage decisions? (2) Although I agreed to the engagement last year, it was forced by circumstances and not my own free will. Can I refuse to acknowledge it now? (3) If I must get married, for the sake of my lifelong happiness, I have no choice but to run away and work as a servant. I wonder if this would violate any criminal laws? (4) If I run away and am found by my family, and I vow not to go home, can my family send me to a reformatory or a police station? (5) If I run away, can Mr. X sue me in court or negotiate with my uncle, demanding compensation for his losses?

[Lawyer Zhu Yakui answers:] (1) Marriage is a right of self-determination. (2) Since you have already agreed, you cannot break the engagement unless there is a reason for invalidation or cancellation (refer to Articles 72 and 92 of the Civil Code). (3) According to Article 976, Paragraph 1, Item 2 of the Civil Code, you should be liable for damages. (4) Since you are an adult, you cannot be sent there unless you have engaged in illegal activities. (5) He can only sue you personally and claim damages.

(2) Zhang Weiwen asks: My father, in his hometown, is known for his integrity and high moral character, and is highly respected by the villagers. In 1940, he was elected as the head of the village. My father and others were unwilling to tarnish their reputation, so the village head fled first. My father was appointed as the village head because he was unable to leave. However, he was unwilling to do so, so he paid to get rid of the position. However, he was originally a member of the school's economic management committee. Because the school was temporarily closed, he remained in his old position and did not pay attention to it. Now that the country has been recovered, this old position seems to be a stain. My father is very uneasy. I wonder if he is suspected of collaboration?

[Lawyer Zhu Yakui answers:] If the school you mentioned was established before the occupation and was not registered with the puppet government, there should be no problem.

### Charitable Relief

Ninety-Year-Old Man Celebrates Birthday with Charity

Mr. Chen Yong'an wrote: To the editor: Yesterday was my ninetieth birthday, and I was honored by the presence of relatives and friends. I deeply regret that I was not able to attend to everyone properly. I am donating 500,000 yuan from the remaining funds saved from the banquet, with 100,000 yuan to the World Red Swastika Society, 100,000 yuan to the Home for the Elderly, 200,000 yuan to the Shanghai Disabled Orphanage, and 100,000 yuan to the Holy Mother's Infant Care Home, to do my best in charity and create blessings for those who love me. I am sending a check for 500,000 yuan. Please collect and transfer it. I am eternally grateful to all my relatives and friends for their kind intentions. Please forgive me for not visiting in person. Chen Yong'an and his son Changyu respectfully.

(Editor's note) Mr. Chen has generously donated 500,000 yuan to four charitable organizations. This office will collect and transfer the funds on their behalf. We hope that the four charitable organizations will quickly prepare official receipts and send representatives to the office to collect the funds. We would also like to express our gratitude on their behalf.

Bank Colleagues Raise Funds to Relieve Drought Disaster

Colleagues at the Shanghai Mercantile Bank wrote: Dear Sirs, Having seen the photos of the disaster-stricken compatriots published in your weekly pictorial on the 8th, we, colleagues at this bank, have raised 200,000 yuan to show our small but sincere compassion. Since we are not aware of any collection agencies in Shanghai, we are sending the above funds to your newspaper specifically for transfer. If you could publish a small notice in the readers' letter column and add a few words of praise, it would be even more fortunate, as it would serve as a promotion for other banks and shops. Sincerely, Shen Bao Office.

(Editor's note) We are deeply grateful for the enthusiasm of the Mercantile Bank colleagues in helping to relieve the disaster and for their benevolent words and meager contributions. We urge philanthropists from all walks of life to generously donate, the more the better, as saving a life is more virtuous than building a seven-story pagoda. This office will send the funds to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for transfer as soon as possible, and on behalf of the disaster victims, we make an urgent appeal.

Yesterday, in the "Haitian" supplement of the Heping Daily, there was a lantern riddle reveal. The riddle was "The mood of an old maid," and the answer was "Shoot one famous reporter." Mr. Chen Guozeng and Mr. Li Qinglai were the first to answer correctly with "Xia Shao Fu."

I wouldn't dare say that my friends are playing a joke on me, but they are exaggerating a bit too much, because although I have been a "reporter" for thirteen years, I am not necessarily "famous." There are many senior colleagues, so how dare I presume?

However, the riddle "The mood of an old maid" makes me conjure up infinite thoughts.

A beautiful woman in her twilight years is indeed having a hard time. She wants to marry, but who should she marry? Younger men may not fancy her, and older men she is unwilling to accept. To remain single for the rest of her life is, after all, unfair to her whole life. Thinking back and forth, she is in a dilemma. This kind of mental distress is multiplied on nights with a clear moon and a gentle breeze, and mornings with fragrant flowers and singing birds.

The poor and the rich are the same. Wealthy old maids are sometimes even more painful, because someone who enjoys a high degree of material comfort often feels a more urgent need for spiritual comfort and appreciates the preciousness of spiritual comfort and the fun of life. Friends who are worried about firewood and rice would not have such thoughts!

As for their fate, it is very simple. Those who are unwilling to remain in obscurity mostly "go to society" and engage in various career activities. Those with weak abilities eat vegetarian food and chant Buddhist scriptures, using religion as an emotional outlet. As for those who seek young husbands, they are probably very few exceptions.

"People reach middle age with two kinds of suffering; life is not easy, death is not sweet," I am afraid I am now also feeling the mood of an old maid, so the lantern riddle made by my friend can be said to have hit the nail on the head.

### Confucius Temple: Twenty-Four Hours

— Xian Chang

Nanjing is the capital of our country, and the Confucius Temple is the heart of this capital. It has beautiful scenery and a mysterious atmosphere. It is an important scene in Nanjing and reflects most of Nanjing's outline, which is no doubt. After the victory, the Confucius Temple has become more prosperous than before. It is not only the site of the Six Dynasties' golden powder on the banks of the Qinhuai River, but also a concentration of commercial entertainment. After the National Government returned to the capital, it became a place for military and government personnel to come and go.

When it gets late at night, the shops have already closed their doors tightly. Apart from a few cars with black license plates and a small number of newly born jeeps running around, only the rickshaw pullers parked on the side of the road are snoring on their cars, recovering from their fatigue of the day. In this dead silence, after the restaurants and shops close, the beggars have long finished their giraffe work (stretching their long necks to beg from the rich and powerful) and come to this concentration camp—the Pan Palace. Their utterly exhausted expressions, covered with straw mats, sleep on the sandy ground, but it is a symbol of hunger. Undoubtedly, it is like a clever director who wants to make the "scene" more distinctive in terms of rich and poor, noble and lowly, and make some need applicable to the "plot." The god of night has already succeeded.

When the sunlight begins to emerge from the horizon during the day, the Confucius Temple is resurrected from the dead. Yellow, black, green, and various colored cars flash through the Confucius Temple at lightning speed. The shops also gradually opened their iron gates, and a burst of children selling newspapers came. The streets and alleys were crowded with people, most of whom were civil servants going to their offices, and the rest were ordinary coolies, workers, and vendors who were struggling to make a living every day. The Confucius Temple is a kaleidoscope; it has everything. All kinds of ingenious advertisements, with colorful silk flags fluttering in the breeze, artistic comics, layered and hung in bright colors, a dazzling array, shocking sacrifices of "buy one get one free" blaring around the street, as a call. The ladies who come and go are dressed in gorgeous clothes; especially the singers, who are painted like artistic sculptures; they come and go in this commercial prosperity, where Chinese and foreign people gather in the Confucius Temple, making their mobile advertisements. In this thriving Confucius Temple—Pan Palace, it can also be said to be a public place for unemployed vagrants. Nine streams, three teachings, and all kinds of things gather in one place, performing magic tricks and selling wound medicine. Singing ditties, dismantling character stalls, and there are also a kind of "Jianghu performers," making faces and dropping spears to make a living. Indeed! From the time the sunlight begins to shine until it sets, the Confucius Temple has always passed in hustle and bustle, without a moment's peace. Every minute, every place, is shouting and yelling. Radio waves and car sounds are mixed together, and yelling and miscellaneous human voices are mixed into one, with lively and dead silence being completely and absolutely opposite. When the sun sets in the west, the dusk is even more lively. Neon lights are turned on on the doors of the shops, illuminating pairs of lovers, and goddesses with faces covered with rouge powder and charming gods, gracefully strolling to and fro on the banks of the Qinhuai River—the Confucius Temple, looking for their night's rest. The breeze blows their paper-thin clothes, startling the flesh exposed in the night. However, they still smile at the Confucius Temple. At this time, the Confucius Temple is at its most prosperous. Amusement parks, cinemas, cafes, restaurants, and tea rooms are all extremely crowded. Jeeps, special cars for National Assembly representatives, and black cars parked at the door are arranged in a long snake formation in one line; all kinds of different sounds and strange lights are illuminating and fascinating. The prosperity of the Confucius Temple is so praised as the heart and pulse of the capital and a scenic spot for the golden powder of the Six Dynasties; this can be seen in the three periods of day, night, and dusk.

### Yu Meiren [Poem Title]

— Xin

Eight years of war have aged me.
In vain I see the beauty of Jiangnan.
Reluctantly swinging on the swing like a youth,
But helplessly, my temples are already speckled with gray.

Catkins drift, without any trace,
Silently, to whom can I speak?
The spring breeze caresses my face,
The wine ripples gently.
I ask, what is the meaning of the little Xie sister's intentions?

### The Process of Nazi Forces Infiltrating South America

— Zhuxi

(I)

Approximately a century ago, Germany had already set its sights on Argentina, a country across the vast ocean of South America, as a destination for its aggression. Germany established a Pan-German strategic organization in Argentina, and President Sarmiento, a prominent figure in Argentina's Democratic Party at the time, was the first to protest. When the world was still indifferent to German activities in 1882, Sarmiento keenly discerned Germany's ambition and issued a warning to his fellow countrymen and the nations of South America: "Once the German settlements in Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, and southern Brazil have established a solid foundation, they will one day become powerful and dangerous colonies of Germans who are solely loyal to their motherland."

Germany spared no expense in systematically implementing its colonization policy on the American continent according to its predetermined plan. Money was spent lavishly, and large quantities of goods were continuously imported into the country. Simultaneously, they reclaimed wasteland, built schools, rewarded practices, and exchanged academic culture. Before long, German bloodlines and German ideology had swept across many important locations in Argentina. Soon after, purely Germanic German areas appeared one after another in various South American countries.

Germany unreservedly promoted its mass transatlantic immigration policy. It passed a special law in the country for immigration to South America and openly established various industrial organizations, banks, schools, clubs, and research institutions, all with the sole purpose of infiltrating South America. Germans who went abroad underwent a kind of ideological training, considering themselves to be superior people of the ruling class.

However, during World War I, Germany's influence in South America suddenly declined. All commercial, political, and cultural ties were completely severed, and the movement of capital also ceased, causing German colonial activities to come to a standstill. The United States and its allies seized this opportunity to improve their own positions.

After World War I, the world focused on reconstruction, striving to forget the cruelty of war and seeking only rest and peace. But the minds of German ambitious people never rested for a moment.

In addition to the philosophy of the German philosopher Clausewitz, who held that "Germany's sacred mission is to civilize other nations," a new science, "Geopolitics," was added. These distorted theories deceived the general Nazi thugs, who implemented their aggressive policies in the name of the "Pan-German League," various overseas organizations, and the German diplomatic corps.

Hess, Bormann, Goebbels, and other Nazi leaders organized a special agency under the pretext of protecting overseas German minorities, coercing overseas German expatriates to join the German National Socialist Party, making them a weapon of German aggression.

(II)

Hitler's Pan-German strategists discovered that British and American commercial forces had infiltrated South America, while the United States, with a new enlightened policy, called on South American countries to unite and help each other to cope with aggressive forces. At this time, Germany urgently caught up, on the one hand, advocating narrow nationalism, threatening and enticing opponents, creating a terrifying situation, on the other hand, greatly expanding industrial and commercial forces, severely affecting British and American commerce.

The Nazi Party used various means to bring the German colonies in South America under the control of the party one by one. Among them, the most powerful was the overseas branch of the Nazi Party, which organized its own police force, intelligence team, and armed forces. All German expatriates had to join the party, otherwise they could not work in German commercial firms and would be in danger of starvation.

According to the investigation of the Argentine government, the Nazi Party had established in Argentina commercial and financial institutions with strong funds, large-scale propaganda organizations, social and cultural groups, more than 200 schools, military liaison stations, and intelligence agencies. The funds for their activities were partly issued by the German Embassy in Buenos Aires via Berlin, partly extorted from Argentine German merchants, and partly freely donated by businessmen. These institutions were under the command of the military attaché of the German Embassy and Nazi Party special agents.

The money used by the German Embassy for political bribery was so astounding that scandals frequently occurred, resulting in the government enacting laws to restrict the funds that any foreign embassy could use. As a result, the Nazi Party members in Argentina exhausted their ability to impose exorbitant taxes and levies. Volberg, a representative of the German Chamber of Commerce, admitted that he had raised US$250,000 in "relief funds" in 1940-41. At the same time, Volberg spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to print the German propaganda newspaper *El Pampero*, which wantonly attacked the late President Roosevelt and Pan-Americanism, boasted about the military successes of the Axis powers, and promoted militaristic nationalism.

German propaganda in Argentina had two major themes: the threat of American imperialism and Germany's benevolence and kindness. The purposes were twofold: one was to arouse the patriotism of Argentinians and arouse hatred towards the United States, and the other was to incite Argentinians to recognize Nazi Germany's world leadership. Although this attempt was not successful, people with wavering wills were ultimately bewitched by this doctrine.

(III)

At the same time, Argentina was gradually moving towards military dictatorship. President Ortiz handed over power to Vice President Castillo in 1941, but Castillo could not lead a country that had been muddled by propaganda. The Argentine army was mostly trained by the Germans, and most of the senior officers had served in the German army, holding the German spirit in extreme reverence. With the help of these military men, the legitimate government of Argentina was finally overthrown by force, and all democratic institutions were closed by the army.

During World War II, Germany could not fulfill its promises made in Mexico City. First, Argentina failed to close the German commercial institutions that were waging economic war against the United Nations in a timely manner; second, the Argentine government failed to close Axis propaganda and instead closed newspapers that advocated democracy.

After Germany lost the war, Argentina remained under a military dictatorship. As long as the Argentine people live under this dictatorship, and as long as any nation in the world does not have freedom, we cannot rest easy for a single day.

### Difficulty of Living

— Shenying

After reading Mr. Shaofu's article "Gold Bars," which mentioned President Ma of the Nanjing *Central Daily News* declaring war on his landlord, I found it to be detached from reality, which aroused my sympathy!

Of the necessities of life—clothing, food, housing, and transportation—housing is the third issue, but instability and threats to life outweigh clothing and food. My family lives in Suzhou. This past January, the landlord told us that his family members who had been serving in the military in the rear were now returning to Suzhou and asked us to move out immediately. I told him that even a wonton vendor couldn't just pack up and move, let alone a family. The next day, an active-duty soldier came. "When a scholar meets a soldier, there's no reasoning with him." Under these unreasonable circumstances, I hurriedly found two rooms in a building, paying rent equivalent to one dan of rice, plus a tip ten times the value of the rice. Fortunately, we weren't left living in the open air, and we got through this difficult time.

Time flies, and four months have passed in the blink of an eye. The price of rice has soared more than tenfold in these hundred-plus days. I can no longer afford the rent of one dan of rice. Fortunately, the local government, recognizing the seriousness of the housing problem, stipulated that rent could not be calculated based on the price of rice. Based on this regulation, I gathered a mediator and the landlord to negotiate, but the result was that not even a sheng of rice could be reduced. From my scholarly perspective, there probably isn't a better solution than offering the landlord one shi of rice.

The first priority in housing is stability. If you're arguing and bickering every day, you don't have the time, and it's too mentally exhausting. Government officials make empty promises, and the reality is that they won't be fulfilled. Scholars writing articles in newspapers can only achieve a reasonable argument on paper. To truly declare war on the landlord probably requires a different kind of person.

Prices are high, life is difficult, people's desires are rampant, and they treat money like life. The issue is no longer about what is reasonable or unreasonable. However, I have deeply tasted the bitterness of the difficulty of living.

### Helicopter

— Nanyi

In today's world, airplanes have become commonplace, but helicopters are still rarely seen, at least in China.

The history of helicopters is not long, but they have undergone significant development during wartime, and the scope of their application is expanding day by day. Although this type of aircraft cannot keep up with ordinary airplanes in terms of speed, it has many advantages of its own.

For example: (1) Ordinary airplanes must have a large airfield for takeoff and landing, while helicopters only need a small piece of land. It is said that helicopters can land very accurately. If you draw a circle on the ground first, it will obediently stop in the middle. Recently, several post offices in the United States have been trying to use rooftops to allow helicopters to land on them, thereby speeding up mail delivery. In addition, more and more private individuals are preparing to purchase helicopters, because as long as there is a green lawn in the home, they can rise and descend as they please.

(2) Ordinary airplanes can only fly straight forward and cannot stop in the air, but helicopters can do this. During the war, the military relied on this performance of helicopters to save the lives of many soldiers. When military personnel were lost in remote mountains and wilderness or adrift in the vast ocean, helicopters could fly to these places where ordinary airplanes could not land, hover in the air, and drop soft ladders to give assistance to those in distress. At the same time, helicopters are more accurate in throwing items than ordinary airplanes. Sometimes when ships or trains catch fire, helicopters can quickly send fire-fighting drugs to the firefighters on the ship and train, with almost no mistakes.

(3) Ordinary airplanes can only fly straight forward at high altitudes, while helicopters can fly at extremely low altitudes, as close as 25 feet from the ground, and the speed can be extremely slow, so they can fly around corners and everywhere. This is extremely useful for work such as spraying insecticides like DDT. In the future, they will definitely make many contributions in epidemic prevention and exploration.

Currently, because helicopters have not yet reached the stage of mass production, the price is quite expensive, ranging from 10,000 to 50,000 US dollars per aircraft. In the future, it may be reduced to 4,000 to 5,000 US dollars per aircraft. At present, American manufacturers have already put a lot of effort into this area, and the age of helicopters is coming.

### Destiny

— Yang Mou

Some have hardships, some have triumphs. Knowledge does not necessarily guarantee your success, and virtue may not necessarily make you soar. In the face of obvious contrasts, you often feel filled with discouragement and have to attribute it to destiny.

Yes, this is the best way to comfort yourself, but it is by no means a way to solve the problem.

We may as well believe that destiny exists, but we must never entrust ourselves to destiny.

Looking back on the ebb and flow of history, we who read history often feel inexplicable sadness, because the development of history can never meet our ideals, and the historical figures who have suffered the manipulation of destiny are too numerous to count.

But the reason why historical figures become historical figures is always the result of their breaking through destiny.

Discouragement, succumbing to the manipulation of destiny, will be abandoned by destiny. Opportunities require you to meet them and find them; they will never come looking for you. Each failure adds a point of courage, believing that you are one step closer to success, then the price of this failure is not in vain.

Who is more powerful than destiny? Those who face destiny without fear of difficulty and setbacks.

Brief Comments

### Both Are Grain Officials: Yang Xizhi and Cheng Maoxing

— Wulingren

Inspector Cheng exposed the inside story of the 940 million yuan grain loan scandal and impeached four grain officials, including Yang Xizhi. In his official letter to the Executive Yuan, he stated: "The evil of unscrupulous merchants is obvious, while the crime of corruption is hidden and difficult to see. For several years, unscrupulous merchants have run rampant, and those who support and encourage them are corrupt officials and bureaucrats. If you want to eradicate unscrupulous merchants, you must first eliminate corrupt officials and bureaucrats." These words are excellent. Unscrupulous merchants are not limited to grain and rice, and is corruption limited only to grain officials?

Cheng Maoxing, a member of the Jiangxi Provincial Government and director of the Jiangxi Provincial Land Tax and Grain Management Office, committed suicide by throwing himself into the river because he was supervising the purchase and transportation of grain and was worried about the failure to complete the task and was unwilling to shirk responsibility. The National Government issued a clear commendation for his actions. However, Shanghai is currently experiencing a major grain loan scandal. Both are grain officials, but their virtue and lack thereof are worlds apart, which is said with much feeling.

It is said that in recent days, the weather forecasts of the observatory have often been inaccurate. This is not surprising. Originally, "The sky has unpredictable winds and clouds," and worldly affairs are also unpredictable, let alone the weather.

Reuters London: "Shanghai, the Soviet Union, and Singapore currently have a strong need for diamonds." This also shows that there are still many rich people in Shanghai?

American tycoon Mr. Rider, who came to Shanghai from the United States, told reporters: "Currently, there are more US banknotes than goods in the United States, and there is a phenomenon of having money but nowhere to buy goods." However, American goods are everywhere on the Shanghai market, and even rickshaw pullers are gorging themselves on chocolate. Isn't this a joke?

News Snippets

### UNRRA Foreign Staff: Three Crates of Beer Per Month

— Feng Yi

Talking about the current labor unrest, the inside story of the barbering industry is the most complicated. There is open and secret struggle between labor and management, and there is a possibility of each side going to extremes. In Shanghai, both the bathhouse and barbering industries have the style of "big playboys." Knives go in white and come out red, and fighting often becomes the last resort when words fail. Bosses are willing to spend money to hire people to work hard and pull strings behind the scenes, but the workers also have a spirit of hard work that cannot be underestimated, so looking at the future development of the "undercurrent," there is still a feeling of a long night with many dreams.

In order to increase work efficiency, Mayor Wu has taken measures to streamline personnel in the municipal government. More than 100 members were laid off this month, including important officials such as counselors and commissioners. It is heard that after the fact, many personnel, because they were related to the "department," went through various connections and back doors, but Mayor Wu has the determination to "lay off personnel" and cannot have the contradictory phenomenon of stopping and using again, so regardless of origin and without giving face, all are rejected. The members also think that Mayor Wu has a heart of stone, and they can only sigh helplessly. Recently, Mayor Wu also has a general discussion on laying off personnel in various affiliated agencies of the municipal government, so everyone is uneasy and suspects each other, wondering who will win the "jackpot" first? It is said that the treatment of civil servants is usually meager, but once employed, it is better than nothing after all.

The Star Island football team's visit to Shanghai for the competition was wildly popular and had good income, which aroused great interest from the backstage boss of a local football club, who intends to "hire at a high price" some players from the Star East team to stay in Shanghai and serve. It is now learned that both sides are secretly negotiating and discussing the terms, but whether or not it will be successful is still in the immature stage. However, according to another source, after the Star East team's competition in Shanghai, they also intend to go to Australia again, and plan to select some players from Shanghai to join the cooperation, preparing for a grand expedition across the ocean. From this point of view, whether the Star East team will be annexed by others or annex others depends entirely on the level of each person's terms.

In addition to salaries, UNRRA staff also have rationed items to share, but there are still differences, that is, foreign staff receive more favorable treatment. Taking beer as an example: foreign staff can receive three large crates per month, with each crate costing only more than 3,000 yuan, while Chinese staff can only receive one large crate per month, with each crate costing more than 10,000 yuan. As for the high or low charge, it is said that the customs believes that foreign staff are guests, so all rationed items are completely tax-free, while Chinese staff are not.

### The Center of Epidemic Prevention Work

— Qiao Shumin

Starting from the Epidemiological History of Cholera

Cholera prevention work requires the cooperation of all sectors of society and multifaceted efforts to be effective. In terms of personal hygiene, the key is to carefully prevent germs from entering the body and to get vaccinated to enhance the body's resistance, as mentioned in the previous issue of this publication. In terms of public health, there is also a focus; without understanding this and blindly engaging in it, little success can be achieved. This is why most of the epidemic prevention work in our country for the past hundred years has been a failure story.

Ancient China did not have true cholera. What they called cholera was indigestion, meaning vomiting and diarrhea, which was actually acute gastroenteritis or food poisoning, not today's true cholera. To treat today's cholera with the elixirs and acupuncture passed down from ancient times is extremely foolish.

Before 1817, true cholera was confined to the delta region of the Ganges River in India. In 1815, the area was flooded, and the following year there was a severe drought. In 1817, it suffered another flood. From then on, cholera suddenly became rampant, invading the continents of Europe, Asia, America, and Africa through sea and land transportation routes, causing six major world epidemics. The first major epidemic was from 1817 to 1823, limited to Asia; the second was from 1826 to 1837, penetrating into Western Europe; the third was from 1846 to 1862, invading the Americas in addition to Europe and Asia; the fourth was from 1864 to 1875, widely affecting the four continents of Europe, Asia, America, and Africa; the fifth was from 1883 to 1896; the sixth was from 1902 to 1912, mainly in Asia, Africa, and Southern Europe. Hundreds of years killed people like flies, and the past history is unbearable to read.

But from 1912 to the present, for more than 30 years, cholera has suddenly disappeared in Europe and America, but it still ravages China and India. What is the reason? This is something that should make people think deeply.

When we study the modern history of Europe and America, it is almost impossible to attribute the recent disappearance of cholera to one measure. For example, the implementation of seaport quarantine, the improvement of environmental sanitation, the progress of public education, the rapid investigation and diagnosis, the strict isolation and disinfection, and the promotion of preventive vaccination all have considerable merit. But in the past 30 years or so, if we seek a epoch-making measure to match the phenomenon of the sudden disappearance of cholera, then there is only "drinking water disinfection."

The experiment of using chlorine gas to disinfect public drinking water began in the laboratory of Chicago, USA, in 1906. After several improvements, it was quickly adopted by European and American countries. Since the adoption of drinking water disinfection, there has been no cholera epidemic in the area. Historical facts are such that it cannot be said that this is not the key.

Moreover, the fact that the main route of cholera transmission is water supply is evidenced by numerous historical examples. The history of the epidemics in Hamburg and England is the most notable. Generally speaking, water supply transmission epidemics have the following characteristics that can be identified:

(1) The sick are limited to the contaminated water supply area.

(2) The distribution of cases corresponds to the distribution of the contaminated water supply.

(3) Those who use the water supply can be infected.

(4) If the contamination of the water supply is only in one or two places, the epidemic will usually be explosive.

(5) The water supply is suspected or proven to be contaminated.

(6) Once the water supply is stopped or disinfected, the epidemic will decrease immediately.

Looking back at China, cholera has been epidemic more than 53 times, and it has become more severe in recent years. How many have died from this disease is unknown! China has had tap water facilities for a very short time. Before the war, it was limited to 17 larger cities, and only seven of them used chlorine gas (or bleaching powder) for disinfection. Even these seven places were limited in scale and could not cover the entire city. However, the areas that used disinfected water supply were able to avoid the intrusion of cholera epidemics. How can this be a coincidence! The past is clear, and it is up to those who care to understand and use it!

Cholera prevention work is not limited to water supply disinfection. It requires the cooperation of all sectors of society and multifaceted efforts, as mentioned earlier. But the focus of the work must be clear. The focus and the center are different. Epidemic prevention work can take health education as the center, preventive vaccination as the center, quarantine inspection as the center, isolation and disinfection as the center, investigation of the source of the disease as the center, improvement of environmental sanitation as the center, and treatment of patients as the center. It should be adapted to local conditions and adapted to the times, so that the various epidemic prevention work can get the coordination and connection it deserves to accomplish the task. But the focus of cholera prevention work must be placed on water supply disinfection. The focus is on the points of emphasis and importance. Make every effort and do not neglect it. "To shoot a man, shoot his horse first, to capture a thief, capture the king first." Preventing cholera is also like this. At this time when the whole country is shocked by the cholera epidemic, avoid panicking. May all of us be able to observe the focus with a calm mind and work together to eradicate it with positive action.

### Diagnosis First!

— Lin Zhaoqi

The primary task of a clinical doctor is diagnosis and treatment. Before a diagnosis is confirmed, the treatment of a disease cannot begin. Therefore, the slogan of clinical doctors is "Diagnosis First," with particular emphasis on "etiological diagnosis." Diagnosis is like a key; without it, one cannot open the "door of treatment" and the "door of prognosis."

In the past decade, there have been epoch-making inventions such as sulfonamides and penicillin, which treat various bacterial infectious diseases, benefiting humanity immensely! No wonder they caused a global sensation, known to both women and children. However, the rational use of specific drugs requires accurate diagnosis; otherwise, one will go in the opposite direction, not only wasting resources but also betraying good medicine, and sometimes even harming the patient! Therefore, although therapeutics has developed rapidly, clinical doctors still regard "Diagnosis First" as the guiding principle.

Diagnostics is the comprehensive application of basic disciplines such as anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, pathology, bacteriology, serology, parasitology, and radiology to each patient case. The patient is alive, and the source of the disease, such as bacteria, parasites, or tumor cells, is also alive. Because of the interaction of these two "living factors," medicine is different from other sciences such as chemistry and physics. Two parts of hydrogen and one part of oxygen will invariably combine to form water, and water has its unchanging properties. Although typhoid bacilli invade the human body and cause typhoid fever, the symptoms of each typhoid patient are not the same, and the occurrence of complications and the prognosis vary greatly. We must understand that the patient's constitution, psychology, nutrition, resistance, age, gender, environment, etc., are different, and the typhoid bacilli have different types, numbers of invasions, and virulence, resulting in complex and even confusing symptoms. In addition to comprehensively applying the above-mentioned basic disciplines, diagnosticians must also use their imagination, discrimination, coordination, and judgment.

Generally speaking, there are the following ten methods for confirming a diagnosis: (1) collecting detailed and precise medical history; (2) conducting a comprehensive physical examination; (3) performing chemical tests on blood, secretions, excretions, transudates, and exudates; (4) using X-ray fluoroscopy; (5) using diagnostic instruments such as esophagoscopes, gastroscopes, bronchoscopes, cystoscopes, sigmoidoscopes, peritoneoscopes, colposcopes, ophthalmoscopes, laryngoscopes, otoscopes, etc.; (6) electrocardiography; (7) basal metabolism measurement; (8) biopsy; (9) exploratory surgery; and (10) autopsy.

The flexible application of the above diagnostic methods depends entirely on the attending physician's ability to choose appropriately according to the patient's condition. For example, in coronary thrombosis, the diagnosis can be confirmed by medical history, symptoms, and electrocardiography. Epidemic meningitis cannot be completely diagnosed without examining the cerebrospinal fluid and blood for cell reactions and bacteria.

From the perspective of diagnosis, diseases can be roughly divided into three categories: (1) diagnoses that are obvious, such as bronchial asthma. Of course, finding the "allergens" that cause bronchial asthma is a most troublesome and often fruitless task. (2) Diagnoses that can only be confirmed after a considerable period of time and research, such as bacterial and serological tests, such as typhoid fever. (3) Sometimes, even after making full use of the most scientific methods, and even after autopsy after the patient's death, a diagnosis cannot be made. This shows that modern scientific medicine has not yet reached perfection and requires the efforts of medical practitioners worldwide, the assistance of other scientific workers, and the encouragement of all humankind.

Human beings possess innate curiosity, a desire for truth, and the joy of cultivation and harvest. In particular, medical and other scientific practitioners regard research and the pursuit of truth as the true meaning and joy of life. Therefore, diagnostics can be said to be the source of the true meaning and joy of life for clinical doctors and the key to medical work. No wonder they loudly proclaim "Diagnosis First!"

### Taiwan Tuberculosis Research Program

Continuing Research and Production of Specific Drugs for Lung Diseases

The "specific drug for lung diseases" invented by a professor at National Taiwan University in Taiwan Province has caused a nationwide sensation. It has not only given great impetus to the scientific and medical communities but also given great excitement to lung disease patients. The reporter made a special trip to interview him and was given the following details:

·From Investigation to Research·

Dr. Chen Lixie was originally a professor at Peiping University Medical College, Northwest Associated University Medical College, and Fujian Medical College. After the retrocession, Director Chen invited him to Taiwan to serve as a professor at National Taiwan University and the director of the Second Affiliated Hospital. He was charged with the mission of investigating Japanese medical research. During his investigation, he first discovered two types of "specific drugs" for lung diseases invented by Japanese professors at National Taiwan University, Katsura Shigehiro (Medical College) and Nozaki Tetsuo (Science College). One is Cepharanthin, a plant belonging to the Menispermaceae family, and the other is L-Rodinsaure, a pure separation of a component of cypress essential oil produced in Taiwan. (Later, there were also hydrogenated additives and lanolin fatty acids discovered by Nozaki.) From a medical point of view, the former has side effects on the treatment of hemoptysis and fever, while the latter has already achieved 20% effectiveness in treating severe lung disease patients. The gradual reduction of tuberculosis bacilli in sputum, the decrease and disappearance of ominous shadows on chest X-rays, the slowing down of erythrocyte sedimentation rate to recovery, and the improvement of other physiological reactions are all good evidence. In the past, the Governor-General invested in research, but after the retrocession, it was suspended like other undertakings. After Dr. Chen discovered it, he reported the information to Director Chen in late February, explaining that it was necessary to continue this research, so he began preparing the research program.

·Treatment Research Program·

After Dr. Chen received the Director's verbal approval for the research, he drafted a program to be submitted to the Director-General's Office for approval within this month. This program tentatively uses NT$1.5 million to NT$2 million as operating funds, and the researchers are eight professors from National Taiwan University, who are responsible for clinical medicine, organic chemistry, pathological anatomy, histology, pharmaceutics, pharmacology, physiology, and bacteriology, respectively, as the main backbone of the Tuberculosis Research Institute. The first phase is preliminary research, the second phase is the establishment of the Research Institute, and the third phase is the expansion of research to establish an experimental hospital. It will borrow the existing facilities of the National Taiwan University Medical College and the First and Second Affiliated Hospitals and employ six to twelve researchers and ten to fifteen associate research assistants.

According to Dr. Chen, although cypress production is high, the extracted components are very small. Only 100 kilograms can be obtained from 100 tons of crude oil. 0.1% is 100 kilograms of Rodinsäure, which is only enough for 1,000 patients for one month. Therefore, at the same time, the dextrorotatory Citronellic Acid obtained from Andropogon nardus and Geranis Acid (also a fatty acid) with a similar structure to Rodinsäure will be mixed together for comparative research, which will be more effective than studying them separately.

·Production Can Begin After March·

Dr. Chen has received letters from many people in the country with remittances to purchase this specific drug. He said with regret: The current stock can only be used for ten patients for half a year. If this program is implemented quickly and there is no problem with the Taiwan Tobacco & Wine Monopoly Bureau's Kosaka Chemical Processing Plant undertaking it, then the previous normal state can be maintained in two or three months, and it can be supplied to the country and Taiwan Province continuously. He firmly believes that cypress oil may one day be scarce, while Andropogon nardus, which is abundant in Taiwan Province, can be used regularly as a supplementary raw material.

In his program, the establishment of sanatoriums is also one of the main undertakings. In the future, research institutes will be established throughout the country, and with the strength of this research institute, a movement to resist and prevent tuberculosis will be launched. He is confident.

Dr. Chen told reporters: Lung disease is a global disease. China is the country with the most lung diseases, ranking first among all human diseases. Therefore, using the existing material resources to achieve success in researching specific treatments is the greatest benefit to mankind! He said with great regret: The pathology of treating pulmonary tuberculosis with fatty acids has not yet been published.

### Two Dietary Habits Related to Cholera Transmission

— Guo Keda

General preventive measures for cholera have been introduced in the previous issue of this publication. Now, let's discuss two small matters that should be reformed in daily dietary habits:

(1) Fruit Disinfection Method: Generally speaking, fruits are not only delicious and refreshing foods, but more importantly, fresh fruits contain a large amount of vitamins, especially vitamin C. Fruits such as oranges, loquats, and grapes originally grow high on trees or vines and do not come into contact with sewage or feces, so it seems that there are no pathogens attached to the skin. However, there are still the following possibilities: First, flies can carry pathogens to the skin. Second, fruit pickers, especially vendors, often wash them with sewage or ordinary unboiled raw water, so it is easy to attach pathogens to the skin. As for fruits such as water chestnuts and sweet potatoes, they grow in the soil and inevitably have been fertilized with feces, so in addition to attaching pathogens, there may also be parasite eggs and cysts on the skin of these fruits.

As for the disinfection method, people generally believe that there is no problem after peeling the fruit with a knife. In fact, this view is specious. Although peeling with a knife can remove most of the bacteria on the skin, the inner layer of the fruit has been unknowingly contaminated with bacteria during the peeling process. Some housewives habitually wash fruits with cold boiled water, believing that this disinfects them. In fact, this only does the negative aspect, because cold boiled water has no effect on killing the pathogens that already exist on the fruit skin. So this is not a reasonable disinfection method either.

From a scientific point of view, the disinfection of fruits should be done according to two principles: (1) A method should be used to kill the bacteria and parasite eggs on the epidermis; (2) The vitamin content inside the fruit should not be lost. According to these two principles, in cities with developed chemical industries, potassium permanganate and other chlorinated disinfectants can certainly be used to sterilize; however, under the current economic conditions of our country's industry, it cannot be universally applied. A fruit disinfection method that is feasible in our country and conforms to scientific principles is very simple: just soak the fruit in boiling water for about three to five minutes, and the pathogens on the epidermis will be quickly killed. At the same time, treat the knife in the same way, and then use this sterilized knife to peel the fruit, and absolutely avoid touching the freshly peeled pulp with your fingers during the entire operation. Fruits prepared in this way can be said to be no longer likely to cause common gastrointestinal infectious diseases after eating.

(2) Rational Dining Method: Logically, since cholera vibrio cannot withstand high heat and can be killed immediately in an environment of 100 degrees Celsius, there should be no cholera bacteria in cooked or stir-fried hot dishes. However, in reality, this is problematic in our country. In Chinese families, especially in restaurants, the bowls, chopsticks, plates, and dishes used for eating are usually washed with raw water, and sometimes with filthy "dishwater," and after washing, they are wiped dry with a "rag" that is a concentration camp of bacteria. Bowls washed in this way look clean on the surface, but in fact, they spread the bacteria to the entire bowl. Then the bacteria are eaten into the stomach along with the food. As the saying goes, "What the eye doesn't see, the heart doesn't grieve." But if our eyes were replaced with a microscope, it would be frightening, because during a cholera epidemic, just one drop of dirty dishwater can contain thousands of living bacteria! Therefore, this bad habit of washing dishes with cold water or dirty water must be reformed.

In fact, a reasonable washing method is very simple: First, wash the bowls and dishes with ordinary cold or warm water, put them in a pot of water and boil them for about ten minutes, then take them out and wipe them dry with a clean white cloth (preferably a cloth that has been boiled in boiling water and dried). It is absolutely safe from the danger of cholera transmission to eat hot dishes and rice served in bowls and dishes that have been boiled in this way. Therefore, whether in ordinary families or restaurants, all bowls, dishes, chopsticks, etc. used to serve dishes and rice must be boiled in boiling water. Especially in restaurants, we should ask the chef to use freshly boiled hot bowls and utensils to serve the dishes and rice, otherwise, refuse to eat.

### Palpitations

— Tao Shouqi

Palpitation is the feeling of the heart beating. In fact, as long as a person lives in the world, his heart is constantly beating, but this beating does not usually make us feel it or pay attention to it. The so-called palpitation refers to the meaning of feeling one's own heartbeat. When palpitations occur, the feeling of beating can be limited to the chest or spread to the head or the whole body, often making people feel not only the heartbeat or throbbing but also a general feeling of discomfort, even panic and great discomfort.

The cause of palpitations can be attributed to the individual or combined effects of the following two factors: (1) changes in heartbeats, such as too fast or too slow rate, too strong force, and irregular rhythm; (2) hypersensitivity of nerve sensation. People have different sensitivities to various sensations such as pain, fever, etc., and this is also true for heartbeats. The influence of these two factors is of equal importance, because people with less sensitive sensations do not feel very fast or irregular heartbeats, while those with hypersensitivity may experience palpitations and feel very uncomfortable if the heartbeat is slightly stronger or faster.

Based on the above two reasons, the situations that can cause palpitations can be divided into the following three categories:

The first category can be said to be physiological conditions. When anyone exercises vigorously, the heart beats faster and stronger than usual, and palpitations will result. If people are not accustomed to exercise, because the body parts have not been properly trained to meet the needs of physical exertion, palpitations are more severe when exercising. Similarly, people who are too excited or frightened will also experience palpitations. In addition, it is easy to cause palpitations when energy is exhausted, because on the one hand, the heart itself is prone to beat faster after fatigue, and on the other hand, the nerves become particularly sensitive after fatigue. Almost everyone has experienced this type of palpitation, and it is the most common cause of palpitations. However, because of differences in individual nerve sensitivity, some people are more prone to palpitations than others.

The second category is that in the course of various infectious diseases and feverish diseases without fundamental heart disease, and during the recovery period of many diseases, palpitations are also a common symptom due to accelerated heartbeat or hypersensitivity of nerves.

The third category is diseases of the heart itself. The reason why heart disease produces symptoms of palpitations is sometimes because the heart's action is hindered, and the heart becomes hypertrophied, resulting in strong and fast beating, but sometimes it is because the rhythm of the heartbeat becomes irregular.

From this point of view, most palpitations are either a reaction of normal people to some physiological conditions or occur in the course of diseases that are not directly related to the heart itself. These types of palpitations are temporary and should never be considered a phenomenon of heart disease. As for the few palpitations caused by genuine heart disease, at this time, there must be definite and obvious phenomena of heart disease that can be detected. Therefore, palpitations and heart disease should not be treated the same. If someone has questions about their own "heartbeat," they should find a reliable doctor to examine them in detail to see if they have heart disease. Otherwise, the more you suspect and the more you pay attention, the more sensitive the nerves will become, and the more severe the phenomenon of palpitations will become. Once you develop a fear or misunderstanding of having heart disease, it will be difficult to correct when it is deeply rooted, and you will create a disease where there is no disease. This type of non-genuine heart disease caused by psychological errors is very common, but it should also be avoided.

### DDT and Its Usage

— Zhang Changshao

This summer, everyone is talking about DDT. The more I hear, the more I feel that accurate reports about this insecticidal wonder drug are not widespread enough, especially regarding its application methods.

DDT is one of the two greatest medical inventions of this war; the other is penicillin. DDT can eradicate all kinds of insects, and it is effective in killing flies, mosquitoes, lice, fleas, and bedbugs, which are the most harmful to humans. Its greatest feature is its residual effectiveness: after one application, the insecticidal effect of DDT can last for days, weeks, or even months. Therefore, DDT is particularly effective against lice crawling on surfaces, fleas hopping around, and bedbugs emerging from cracks. In the first day or two after application, there may still be survivors, but after a few more days, all can be completely eliminated, with no one spared.

To achieve the maximum effect of DDT, appropriate application methods must be adopted according to the type of insect. Currently, many people casually buy a bottle of pesticide on the street and spray a little here and there in the house with a sprayer, which really cannot exert much effect. First, many of the DDT products sold in beer bottles at street stalls are not good quality. Some do not contain enough DDT to meet the standard, and some are simply outright fakes—a bottle of kerosene or gasoline with a DDT label to deceive people out of one or two thousand yuan. Naturally, these inferior and fake products cannot have any effect. Second, even if you buy good DDT, spraying it so casually will not achieve practical results and is almost a waste.

Before discussing accurate usage methods, I must first introduce the properties of DDT, because its special properties determine its usage.

DDT is a transparent crystal or white fine powder, which is extremely stable and not easily spoiled or volatilized and lost. Therefore, once its solution is sprayed on walls or utensils, its insecticidal effect can be maintained for a long time. Because it is insoluble in water, clothing and bedding treated with DDT can still maintain their effectiveness even after repeated washing. Various oils, such as soybean oil, raw oil, vegetable oil, tung oil, etc., as well as various organic solvents that can remove oil stains, such as gasoline, kerosene, vinegar, and alcohol, can dissolve DDT to form a solution. The commonly used DDT solution is its kerosene solution, containing five grams (gm.) of DDT in every hundred cubic centimeters (C.C.).

The insecticidal effect of DDT must also be mentioned. DDT works by paralyzing the nervous system of insects. When insects land on a surface that has been sprayed with the pesticide, DDT is quickly absorbed and becomes toxic. After poisoning, the nerves are initially stimulated, causing erratic flying and movement, followed by paralysis and falling to the ground, and finally, complete paralysis and death. Therefore, it takes a considerable amount of time for DDT to kill insects. The length of this time depends on the concentration of the active ingredient in the solution or powder, the type of insect, and the duration of contact between the insect and the pesticide. If a 5% solution is used, flies and mosquitoes will usually die after about half an hour, while bedbugs will die after several hours or even a day or two.

Many people believe that DDT has an immediate insecticidal effect, and some believe that DDT can keep insects away, but neither is true. Old-fashioned insecticides such as pyrethrum can kill insects immediately, and mosquito repellents used in America emit an odor when applied to the skin, keeping mosquitoes away. Although DDT does not have these two effects, its lasting residual effect can kill insects over a long period, so it has the wonderful advantage of being effective once and for all.

DDT is also quite toxic to humans and animals, so it is important not to spray it on food and utensils. Its solution can also be absorbed through the skin, and excessive absorption can lead to poisoning, so the solution should not be used to wipe the body. However, the powder and emulsion are not absorbed through the skin and can be used to kill various insects on the body, such as head lice, body lice, pubic lice, and fleas. I have introduced the properties of DDT in detail above, and now I can talk about the application methods.

For flying insects such as flies and mosquitoes, the application of DDT cannot completely eliminate flies and mosquitoes in the house unless screens are installed or attention is paid to closing windows. For houses with screened windows and doors, adding DDT can continue to kill insects that accidentally fly in and supplement the lack of strictness of the screened windows and doors. If there are no screening facilities and you cannot pay attention to closing windows, DDT can only reduce but not completely eliminate flies and mosquitoes in the house. The principle of application is to ensure that any surface in the house has traces of the pesticide, so that once mosquitoes and flies enter the house and stop, they will come into contact with the pesticide and die of poisoning. The application can be divided into three methods: spraying, painting, and brushing. The spraying method uses a kerosene solution of DDT, the painting method uses DDT dissolved in tung oil or varnish, and the brushing method uses DDT fine powder closely mixed with glue powder. A concentration of 5% DDT is generally considered the most suitable. Spraying is usually the most convenient method, and the sprayed droplets should be just like drizzle. Sprayers that turn the liquid into a mist, stay in the air, and are not easily absorbed are not suitable. If there is no suitable sprayer, then use a brush to apply the liquid to the ceiling, walls, doors, and windows. When brushing, a mask moistened with water must be worn over the nose and mouth. After brushing, open the windows to allow the solvent to evaporate. It can be inhabited about four hours later. After the solvent evaporates, it leaves white traces of the pesticide, which is especially obvious on glass. Its effect can last for one or two months. The effect of brushing and painting methods can last for about three months. The most important places to apply pesticide in the home are the kitchen and toilet, targeting flies; the second is the place of work and bedroom at night, targeting mosquitoes.

Currently, people generally use fly swatter-style sprayers to spray DDT, spraying a little here and there in the room every night, sometimes spraying at mosquitoes in the air. This sacrifices the characteristics of DDT and forces it to be used as an old-fashioned insecticide such as fly swatters, which is really a waste. Used in this way, it can indeed knock down a few mosquitoes in the room, but the fine mist eventually falls to the ground with dust and cannot exert its lasting effect, which is a pity. Moreover, the effect of this method is not as good as fly swatters, because DDT does not have an immediate insecticidal effect. As for the weak knockdown effect obtained during spraying, it is actually due to the kerosene that dissolves DDT, which has nothing to do with DDT itself. If used every day, people in the room will often inhale the fine mist, which may produce chronic poisoning, which is extremely inappropriate.

For bedbugs, DDT is much more effective than for flies and mosquitoes. The solution is better than the powder. About half a pound of solution is needed for each bed (including the bed frame, mattress, bedding, and pillows) to kill all the bedbugs. One application can last for several months. The mattress and bed frame can be brushed with a cloth dipped in the pesticide solution, while the bedding and pillows can be sprayed with a sprayer to make them slightly damp. After spraying the top, turn it over and spray the bottom. As for the cracks in the bed frame, there is no need to treat them specifically, because when bedbugs come out of the cracks to forage for food, they will come into contact with the pesticide traces on the way and be poisoned, with no chance of escape. Wear a mask during application, and after application, open the windows for ventilation for four hours to allow the kerosene to evaporate before living there.

DDT powder, containing 5% to 10% DDT, is suitable for killing insects such as lice and fleas. Body lice are the vector for transmitting relapsing fever and typhus. The greatest medical contribution of DDT lies in reducing body lice and controlling the prevalence of the above two diseases. Its application belongs to the specialized scope of public health authorities, and I will not elaborate on it here. If an individual finds lice or fleas on their body, DDT powder can be sprinkled on the underwear and worn, and the bedding can also be sprinkled with powder. For head lice and pubic lice, DDT solution must be used to wipe the hair. It should be noted here that DDT solution should not be applied to the body to kill insects, as there is a risk of absorption and poisoning. The powder is safe.

Spring and Autumn

### Love of Rivers

— Shi Bei

1.  Nanming River

When mentioning the scenery of Guiyang, everyone will not forget the charming Huaxi, but Huaxi is more than twenty miles away from the city. In the city, the only scenic spot, I think, should be the Nanming River. During the turbulent times of war, I spent a winter and an early spring season on the banks of the Nanming River. I appreciated the quiet beauty of the river and the clarity and simplicity of nature.

In the rainy and silent Guiyang, only the Nanming River is bright and lovely. The small river bay is often as calm as a mirror; there are no boats coming and going, and the river water is as clear in all seasons. Only small fishing boats, carrying fishing gear, sway in the heart of the river in twos and threes, like a team.

Next to the river bay in front of the riverside park, a natural swimming pool has been opened. The ancient trees on the riverside are deep and secluded, green reflecting the flowing waves. The long embankment stone road is clean and dust-free. In the hot summer, this place becomes the most worthwhile place to linger in the city.

In winter, I love to see the snow on both sides of the Nanming River. The bright snow reflects on the river surface, which is frozen into a thin layer of ice. The branches by the river are covered with strings of icicles, hanging upside down as if about to fall. The reflection of the snow-covered new bridge is just like a picture of bitter cold antiquity.

That winter, it snowed heavily for several consecutive days. Every morning, in the vibrant morning air reflected by the sparkling snow, I would walk along the Nanming River to the mountains of the riverside park to step on the snow. When I returned, I would also go to see if the snowman that I and the children had built was damaged.

Now I have left that place for several years. When can I return to the Nanming River to find the traces of snow from that day?

2.  Jialing River

Jialing River, this beautiful and crisp name, many people have infinite love and longing for her. Like a ribbon, not too big or too small, she flutters among the mountains and rivers of Bashu. Beside Chongqing, she gives this noisy mountain city a lot of tranquility and gentle adjustment.

During the foggy season, the white fog covers the mountains and rivers. Standing by the river, watching the fog gradually dissipate, the river scenery gradually unfolds before your eyes. Sails emerge from the fog and slowly move closer. If the thick fog persists for a long time in the morning, you stand on the riverbank, and you can't even see the shadow of the pier. Only very sparse and slow oars strike the water. The vast sea of fog swallows everything. At this time, you try to hire a small boat, carefully shake it away, and float with the light swinging of the side of the ship, it really feels like a god traveling on the clouds.

The clearest time for the Jialing River is in the spring. Wheat and broad beans on both sides of the river exude fragrance. The beach under Jinyun Mountain is the most ideal place for spring suburban horse riding. Tourists who go to Beibei Hot Spring ride horses and chase after each other on the horse riding field here.

In summer and autumn, the Jialing River rises, which is said to be the busiest season for boatmen to transport goods. Early in the morning, the songs of the boatmen and trackers flutter on the riverbank. Under the scorching sun, these hardworking and strong sons of the river are all naked, and their natural strength and boldness remain on the beach where their footprints have stepped.

When winter comes, the Jialing River sinks into the foggy season again.

I love the Jialing River as I love the days I spent by the river. I have been living by the river for a year, and I have not left her for a day during this time. Every evening, I walk by the river, watching the sails in the heart of the river return with the sunset, and watching the evening star on the river, shining with the first degree of light...

The love of rivers is deep and sincere. I love rivers as I love the shining and clear life. For this reason, I know how to find a simple life. Rivers, I want to sing for you!

### Random Notes from Prison (4)

— Yao Che

Handling a case requires investigation and prosecution by the prosecutor, repeated trials by the judge, investigation of evidence, and defense by the lawyer. If the judge's judgment is unfair, the prosecutor can also file an appeal, and if the parties are dissatisfied, they can also appeal layer by layer... It can be said that it is very complete. I often wonder why so many unreasonable facts still occur. I found that the people's level of knowledge is too low. Many kind old people are simply ignorant of the law, and the law is so complicated, like a net, that they will bump into it if they are not careful. At this time, they are at a loss and are at the mercy of others, or accidentally violate the law, or fall into a "three-character unjust case."

At the same time, I also deeply feel that the law is the most flexible thing, and it is not as rigid and impartial as ordinary people imagine.

Here, a prisoner sentenced to death does not necessarily die, while a person who has been declared innocent has already been imprisoned for three to five years, or even died of illness in prison.

Therefore, here, people deeply believe in a thing called "fate" and believe that it is irresistible.

Here, people's way of dealing with "fate" is first to "rely on" - this is a reflection of "one character in the court, nine cattle can't pull it out," I don't think it needs to be explained any further; the second is to "delay." If your lawsuit is not sure to win, you delay the time (appeal is one way of "delaying"), so that people can't find a handle, and it will end by itself. Moreover, as time drags on, people change, and the "victim" is gone. If no one is against you, you can find a way to get bail.

But is "fate" really irresistible? I have seen someone slip out of her hands...

Expectation of Freedom

In recent days, I have been looking forward to regaining my freedom.

However, this period of expectation is the most difficult to endure. A person who has been wronged and lost his freedom, once he hears that the wrong can be redressed and he can see the light of day again, his mood is of course a burst of excitement, but this excitement cannot last long. After a burst of excitement, it is followed by mixed feelings, and, as one day passes after another, he cannot immediately step out of the threshold of this spiritual prison. This situation is unbearable for even a minute.

I deeply feel that a person who is imprisoned, the period of time when he first comes in and the period of time when he is about to go out are the most difficult to get through.

When a person is brought down from the free world into prison, his freedom is deprived, and everything is restricted. Just like a tiger trapped in a cage, he feels infinite pain. If he has been wronged, he is even more full of anger and grievance, which is constantly tormenting his heart and cannot be suppressed. When he is too excited, he even wants to die, using death as a complaint against his injustice. Therefore, every prison pays special attention to new prisoners.

However, this period of time is short and easy to get through, because people are the most adaptable animals. As long as they spend ten days or a week, they will gradually get used to this difficult life. Moreover, if you look around at the people who are in the same difficulty as you, you can find that there are many who are more wronged than you, which also helps you to dilute your feelings of injustice. At the same time, you still have hope. You believe that you will not be convicted without guilt, and you still have to use all your heart and energy to find a way to clear your injustice, so you temporarily suppress your anger. Although in the long sleepless nights, when you think more and more angrily, until you can't relieve it, an impulse to commit suicide will inevitably surge in your heart, but this is easy to overcome, because you have a reason not to die. Because your injustice has not yet been redressed, you are not willing to do such a stupid thing that hurts your loved ones and pleases your enemies.

Even if you are wrongly convicted and sentenced to live here for ten or eight years, that is not a big deal. Of course, you are very sad when you receive the judgment, but since you have done everything you can, you can no longer resist the control of this "fate." At the same time, this matter can be considered to have a result - although it is an unfortunate result - you don't have to worry about it anymore, and you breathe a sigh of relief. Moreover, you are already used to the life here. So, you have to pack up your wounded heart, bury hope deeply along with injustice and anger, completely isolate yourself from the outside world, forget the days, and live in a muddle-headed way. Time passes quickly. Although you feel that one day is as long as a year, if you look back occasionally, a year is like a day.

But when you always hear that you have encountered a general amnesty, or have been declared innocent, and will soon be able to regain your freedom. At this time, a commotion starts again in your heart. The emotion is quite chaotic and complex at first. You are so excited that you can't speak. You don't know whether to laugh or cry. Your eyes are full of tears of excitement. You sit down and try to calm down this passion, but you also want to walk around and tell anyone about this uncontainable joy.

Day after day. Every morning when you wake up, you have a hope: "Can I go out today!" You go to the wooden gate from time to time and look out from the square window hole. People are still doing their own things as usual, and it seems that no one cares about your mood. Perhaps you want to find someone to talk to about your good news; but the other party only answers faintly: "Maybe it will be soon?" It's hard to get through this long day, and there's no movement at all. In the evening, you reopen the bedding that you have packed and prepared to go out, sigh, fall on the bed, and start many thoughts again...

In these days, your hope has risen again. You think of home, you think of relatives and friends, you think of the future of your career, you think of everything... When you think of happy things, you smile, and when you think of sad things, you cry... At this time, you think of everything you have suffered in these days, thinking from beginning to end. Thinking of being framed by others, resulting in imprisonment and suffering, causing damage to your family, affecting your career, your time, energy, and economy have suffered irreparable losses, all your life's efforts have been destroyed, and even your closest and loved ones have also suffered because of this... Thinking of this, you will feel that your injustice is incomparably great, and you will feel that your hatred is incomparably deep. You have never thought so thoroughly as you do now, although your injustice has now been redressed.

When you think angrily at night, you will clench your fists and hit the bed angrily, thus waking up the cellmate sleeping next to you. If the enemy is right in front of you, you would punch him to death, and be willing to sacrifice the freedom you are about to gain as the price of revenge, without the slightest care.

I am looking forward to the arrival of freedom with the greatest ability! (End)

### Also Talking About Qu Yuan

— Yuan Shanyuan

For the Poet's Day, many places have talked about Qu Yuan. I haven't read each person's talk in detail, so I don't know much. But I also have some opinions, so I might as well add my two cents and talk about it here.

Perhaps the public sympathizes with Qu Yuan's suicide. Naturally, I also sympathize with him. However, I absolutely do not approve of his suicide, let alone such a weak suicide.

I admire the Confucian spirit of "knowing it cannot be done, yet doing it anyway." Why couldn't he have known it could not be done, yet done it anyway? If the goal was to win the sympathy of future generations, knowing it couldn't be done and doing it anyway could have achieved that, not to mention that the result would have been more than just winning the sympathy of future generations! For some annoyance, "hanging oneself in a ditch," causing pain to loved ones and joy to enemies, is really not worth it!

If things in the world are truly impossible, and death is inevitable, and suicide is unavoidable, then one should indeed find one or two people who deserve to die and can be killed, and fight to the death with them, perishing together. The modern Mrs. Dewey (?) once said, "I won't commit suicide. If I were to commit suicide, I would kill a few people who deserve to be killed first." This saying, I think, could also be generally applied in ancient times. "I will perish with you!" is an expression of this spirit.

Since Qu Yuan's suicide, the impact left behind can be said to be very bad. For more than two thousand years, Chinese literati have never wanted to cheer up. Whenever they encounter setbacks, they only have that pitiful appearance of "looking haggard" and "wandering by the riverside." Then, if they don't jump into the water like Qu Yuan, they often vomit blood and die. In modern times, we no longer need this kind of literati!

Modern literati, if they encounter a fate as bad as Qu Yuan's, being harmed by their colleagues and unable to develop their ambitions, there is no need to grieve at all, especially no need to commit suicide! Do what you can, little by little. If this path doesn't work, there are other paths. Anyway, it's serving society and serving the country. Personal honor and disgrace can be put aside. Grieving or committing suicide is just making too much of oneself, focusing on petty squabbles. Instead, one forgets the mission one should bear.

If the Grand Master Shangguan and Jin Shang and their ilk are truly incorrigible, and you are not the only one suffering from them, but many people, and many people are helpless, then you can also use the spirit of suicide to resolutely get rid of them! "Bees have venom, let alone humans!" I don't believe a literatus is truly so weak that he has no strength to truss a chicken! If one truly has no strength to truss a chicken and cannot strike with one blow, then there is still a "three-inch tongue that won't rot" and a "three-inch pen that doesn't obey the rules." Why wouldn't verbal attacks and written criticisms have some effect! If not, even bumping into his door to die is more meaningful than quietly jumping into the water.

Now that the times have arrived, we no longer need Qu Yuan-style literati; a madman who "splatters the king with neck blood within five steps" is something we yearn for. Modern literati should cheer up: "Respond to bad sounds!" "An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth!" As long as this revenge is not purely for personal gain.

Qu Yuan has been dead for more than two thousand years, so let him pass like that. We sympathize with him, but it's not worth praising him excessively, lest we praise out some problems and cause modern literati to cry and wail and act ugly when they are upset, and finally "die from rash actions!"

### Deliberations on Governing the Yellow River (3)

— Chu Tongan

(D) Further Governing and Utilizing the Yellow River

Construction of Reservoirs in the Upper Reaches of Tributaries: We know that in the North, not only does the Yellow River have frequent floods, but also the tributaries of the Yellow River can frequently cause disasters, as exemplified by the Luo River mentioned earlier. And these waters, in April and May, often dry up, leaving only a riverbed. Such rivers, of course, only bring harm and no benefit. If reservoirs can be built in appropriate places in the upper reaches of each tributary, then the banks of these tributaries will only benefit and not suffer. We know that in the North, there is mostly snow in winter, especially on the higher mountain peaks and shady slopes, which often only melt in March and April. If the water from the melting snow can be stored in reservoirs, and slowly released in the driest seasons of May and June to irrigate the downstream, it will greatly reduce the disasters caused by drought. And in late summer and early autumn, when heavy rains come and mountain floods break out, each reservoir should store as much water as possible to reduce the water storage burden on the Yellow River sluices. In this way, it can both prevent drought and control floods, so that the areas through which each tributary flows will be benefited. Water is indeed something that cannot be ignored in governing the Yellow River.

(II) Construction of Large Forests: Everyone is familiar with the potential of forests to regulate water and drought. In ancient times, the mountainous areas of North China were covered with forests. Due to the fact that people only knew how to cut down trees indiscriminately without replanting, they have all become barren mountains. Now, there is a plan to build a large horizontal forest in the northern parts of Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Gansu, as well as in Chahar North and Suiyuan South. If this forest passes through the upper reaches of the Yellow River basin, then the floods and droughts of the Yellow River and its tributaries will surely decrease day by day. In modern times, it is not impossible to use scientific methods to pump water for irrigation and to plant trees on barren mountains. Therefore, I believe that if a large forest, several miles deep and thousands of miles long, can be artificially created in these areas, then not only will the Yellow River flood be permanently quelled, but the drought in the North can also be solved. However, this arduous task cannot be completed in a short period of time.

(III) Irrigation Plan for the Lower Reaches of the Yellow River: The North China Plain often suffers from drought in May and June. Since the Yellow River is the only large river in North China, its water should be fully utilized for irrigation. In the past, Jia Rang suggested using diversion canals to irrigate the Hebei region. Now, this method can be further applied using scientific and technological techniques. I believe that a canal should be dug on both the north and south sides of the Yellow River. The northern one should run along the Taihang Mountains to the Yi River; the southern one should run vertically through the rivers in southern Henan to the Huai River. Usually, these two canals should maintain a certain amount of water to facilitate transportation. In times of drought, sluices should be used to control the water of the Yellow River and divert it into these two canals to increase the water volume in the canals. In addition, ditches should be dug along both sides of the canals to facilitate irrigation. Then, the water conservancy in the North will surely achieve greater and more significant results due to the opening of these two canals.

(IV) Design of New Canals Near Xitao: "The Yellow River causes a hundred harms, but only enriches Wuyuan." This old saying is indeed very accurate; because in the area near Wuyuan, people have dug many canals to divert river water for irrigation, which has turned the area into a heavenly palace beyond the border. Now, there is a plan to dig a new canal from the Zehekou in Wuyuan, all the way to the north of Baotou. On both sides of this new canal, several branch canals will be dug vertically and horizontally. And at the intersection of the new canal and the Yellow River, new-style sluices will be built to control the water volume. Then, millions of acres of land on both sides of this new canal can be irrigated, and its economic value will be more beneficial than the Minsheng Canal created by diverting water from the Dahei River near Salaqi.

(V) Water Pumping Project and Irrigation North of Yinshan: I remember that before World War II, when the Soviet Union was immersed in implementing the Five-Year Plan, because the water volume of the Moscow River was too small to allow larger ships to reach Moscow directly, they installed a set of the world's largest water pumps to draw water from a river dozens of miles north of Moscow to increase the water volume of the Moscow River, so that larger warships could reach Moscow directly. Now, north of the Yinshan Mountains in Suiyuan Province, there is a "black soil belt" that has always been overlooked. This black soil, which is rare in the Yellow River basin, has been abandoned due to the inability to obtain water sources. The distance between the Yinshan Mountains and the Yellow River adjacent to this black soil belt is only about twenty or thirty miles. If a river channel can be dug from the Yellow River to the north to the southern foot of the Yinshan Mountains, the water of the Yellow River can be diverted to the southern foot of the Yinshan Mountains. Then, a set of huge water pumps can be installed there to draw water from this river channel, pass it through the Yinshan Mountains, and reach the black soil belt in Beili. The Yinshan Mountains are extremely rich in coal, almost everywhere, which can be developed nearby as a power source for the water pumps. Once the black soil belt obtains this water source, several channels can be dug to store this water for irrigation. Then, the hundreds of miles of black soil plains in the two counties north of Yinshan, which have been abandoned for thousands of years, will be well irrigated and may become the best farmland in North China. This water conservancy project, which saves labor, costs little, and yields great benefits, has not been noticed by anyone until now, and should be brought up for discussion.

(E) Appendix (Discussion on the Yellow River Governance Plan Proposed by Mr. Yang Mengming)

Recently, I read the article "Turning Water Disasters into Water Conservancy" by Mr. Yang Mengming, published in the Shen Bao on May 10th, and I feel that there are many places that deserve discussion. Therefore, I have recorded my humble opinions below for reference in governing the Yellow River.

(I) Mr. Yang believes that the main cause of the Yellow River's disasters is "excessive sediment, which leads to siltation in the lower reaches." I dare not agree with this statement. Major rivers in the world often have floods. For example, the Mississippi River and its tributaries in the United States have flooded many times in history, washing away farmland and houses, sometimes covering several states. The reason is that there is too much rainfall in the basin, the river water level rises sharply, and the river channel cannot contain it, which causes the land on both sides to be submerged. Another example is the flooding of the Nile River, which is caused by the seasonal tidal winds from the Arabian Sea blowing regularly to the vicinity of Abyssinia, creating a rainy season. As a result, the flow of the Blue Nile and the White Nile increases sharply, and the downstream channel cannot contain it, which leads to flooding; because the rainfall is regular, the flooding is also regular, so the Egyptians benefit from the flooding. In fact, the main cause of the Yellow River's disasters is also the heavy rains that occur in the basin in June and July, which cause the water level to rise sharply; as for "excessive sediment," this is just a secondary cause of the flooding.

(II) Mr. Yang advocates that the key to governing the Yellow River lies in changing its course, so as to reduce sediment and make it similar to the Yangtze River. This point must be discussed: First, according to the river course proposed by Mr. Yang, which advocates that the upper reaches pass through the valleys of the Wushu Mountains and divert the water of the Yellow River into the Wei River, can this method of rectification reduce the amount of yellow sand entering the Wei River through Wushu? From the Lower Sancha Kou to Shaanxi, the terrain of the Sancha Kou is steep, the water flow will be rapid, and the soil quality in Guanzhong is also composed of loess. It will inevitably cause a lot of erosion. Compared with the original river course, the degree of sediment is probably not significantly reduced. Second, the project of excavating the Wushu Mountains is too large, and the current Chinese economic strength cannot bear it. Third, due to the uncertain water volume of the Yellow River, if it flows through the Guanzhong Plain for 400 miles when the water rises, it will inevitably be difficult to prevent floods. In this way, the flood that originally did not need to be prevented in the upper reaches will now require an extra layer of prevention.

(III) Mr. Yang advocates that the rectification of the lower reaches of the Yellow River should involve diverting the Yellow River into the Huai River, and then from the Huai River through the vicinity of the East China Sea to the sea. In this way, the total course will increase by about 200 miles compared to the original river. First, it flows from southeast to the Huai River, and then turns northeast to the sea. Since the distance has increased and there are many bends, it is impossible to achieve the "smooth and direct flow" that Mr. Yang mentioned. Mr. Yang put forward "smooth and direct flow" as the key to rectifying the lower reaches of the Yellow River, and this statement is indeed to the point; however, from Zhongmu to Fengtai, the area passed through is the loosest and lowest loess plain. It is not easy to make it "smooth"; because the terrain is too flat, even if the Yellow River has a normal flow, sediment is still very likely to accumulate; once there is sediment, the riverbed will inevitably become shallower, and the river channel will inevitably become higher, so how can it be "smooth"? And Mr. Yang believes that diverting the Yellow River into the Huai River can make it "directly flow" into the sea. However, he does not know that once the Yellow River enters the Huai River, the tributaries in the upper reaches of the Huai River will inevitably have no choice but to return to the Yellow River; these tributaries, as Mr. Yang said, can become water disasters like the "sand river"; because when the Yellow River floods, it is also when the Huai River and these tributaries flood; so, combining the water of the Yellow River with the Huai River, wouldn't it make the water disasters of the Huai River even more serious? The course has increased by 200 miles, and it is impossible to make it "smooth and direct." On the contrary, there are 200 more miles of flood-prone areas. Wouldn't that be counterproductive! Moreover, changing the river course is no easy task. Not to mention the difficulty of excavating the Wushu Mountains, the section from Zhongmu through Fengtai to the Huai River also requires digging a new river, which is also a considerable project. According to recent actual surveys, the old channel of the Yellow River has only silted up by two to one-and-a-half inches. If it is dredged, it will not be laborious or costly, and it can also achieve twice the result with half the effort.

(IV) Mr. Yang said that after the Yellow River changes its course, the Yellow and Huai rivers will merge, so that large ships can sail directly to Zhoujiakou in the lower reaches of the Yellow River, making it a commercial port equal to Hankou; this point also needs to be discussed: because the water volume of the Yellow River is generally much smaller than that of the Yangtze River. Except for the sudden increase in water volume during large floods, its water volume in other periods is only equivalent to a tributary of the Yangtze River; this is a natural shortcoming, and even if the river course is changed, it will not help; therefore, under the circumstances of limited water volume, it is almost impossible for giant ships to sail directly to Zhoujiakou.

The author saw Mr. Yang's article and felt that there were many places that had to be brought up for discussion, so he hurriedly wrote this article. Because there are not many reference materials at hand, it is inevitable that there will be omissions and errors. Please give me your guidance. (The End)

Long Serial

### Double Flying Together (53)

— Zhao Qingge

Why didn't Boss Liao fire Bao Ling too? First, because he cherished her as a descendant of a scholarly family, and he and Master Mo had some dealings in the past. Second, Bao Ling not only did the accounting work, but also helped Liao Dong with his studies. Bao Ling was earning one salary and doing two jobs. This matter made the Madam even more dissatisfied. Although Boss Liao explained the above reasons to her, the Madam was even angrier. The Madam's anger came from jealousy. She felt that Boss Liao kept Bao Ling entirely for the sake of Liao Dong. In her opinion, Liao Dong should drop out of school and do the accounting work at Hui Chun Tang. This would save the expense of an accountant and the expense of Liao Dong's schooling. It would be a double win, and nothing could be better. However, Boss Liao was unwilling to do so. Boss Liao's affection for Liao Dong was favoritism towards the son of the previous wife; favoritism towards the son of the previous wife meant that he still loved the previous wife; according to this logic, although the son of the previous wife was now under her control; and the previous wife had long turned into dirt; she still couldn't help but feel jealous! This kind of subconscious psychological abnormality was something she couldn't realize herself. This is also a common phenomenon among wives who remarry. They can't explain it themselves, and others can't understand their complex and subtle emotions.

After the Madam developed a prejudice against Boss Liao, she hated Liao Dong even more! Liao Dong's every move aroused the Madam's disgust! Although Liao Dong was extremely careful and restrained, he couldn't please the Madam. Because of this, Liao Dong suddenly realized one day, and he said to Bao Ling very painfully:

"It seems that only if I am not in this family, will my stepmother be happy, and will my family be peaceful!"

"Yes!" Bao Ling said. She couldn't help but secretly admire Liao Dong's intelligence. "What you said is absolutely correct, unless you let her forget your existence, she will live contentedly, and you can improve yourself!"

Bao Ling's inspiration gave Liao Dong a deeper awakening, and at the same time, he began to sprout the same idea as Bao Ling—to leave home! He was thinking of trying to "stand up," but he wasn't far from learning to "walk"! How easy would it be? Where would he go after leaving home? He was still very young! So he was at a loss and became even more sad!

The Madam also suddenly became clever. She came up with a win-win solution that could compensate for all the losses on Liao Dong's body. She happily told Boss Liao about this brilliant plan. She said in a very kind tone. .

"Dong'er is already twelve years old, and he will be fifteen next year. It's time to pay attention to his marriage. I want to find him a child bride, first because I am busy with Liang'er all day and can't take care of Dong'er. Finding a girl who is a little older than Dong'er can take care of him, and you will save yourself worry. Second, when the guys are all fired, there will be a shortage of manpower to do chores at home. Dong'er still has to go to school and can't do anything. If he has a wife, she can help us take care of the housework. It's always more considerate and reliable than someone hired from the outside. Moreover, people hired from the outside will only help you for three to five years at most, but your own wife can help you for a lifetime." The Madam spoke a lot of principles in a serious manner. At first, Boss Liao didn't quite agree, but after thinking about it, he found it quite reasonable, so after considering it for a while, he readily agreed.

"Okay! But where can I find a suitable matchmaker?"
