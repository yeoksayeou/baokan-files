This order is the same goal we defended and sought through arduous battles. After the speech, Zhu Xinmin translated it into Russian, and the Soviet troops present responded with enthusiastic applause.

He said that his greatest task was to transport over 100,000 Japanese prisoners of war back to their country. During this period, he was deeply grateful for the kindness and assistance he received from our side. Now that the transportation of Japanese prisoners of war is about to be completed, his task will also be completed. He is very willing to write an article on behalf of the Japanese people to thank China for its magnanimity. As a war criminal, he hopes that China will recover quickly. When the reporter asked him about his feelings about his life, he said: His mood is very good. The environment here is like a villa. When he sees the red sun setting every day and the slanting sun reflecting on the surface of the Pearl River, his heart feels refreshed, like flowing water and drifting clouds, and he is filled with joy. He also said that he most enjoys reading, especially Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People, but he regrets that his Chinese is not good. When he talked about his feelings on the Chinese battlefield, he said that he had boundless remorse. Needless to say, all the mistakes of the past, Japan needs China to support it in the future to have hope because Japanese culture all comes from China. Finally, the reporter inquired about his family situation. He said that he had two sons, the elder one had already died in battle, and there was only a thirteen-year-old son in Japan. However, his home in Tokyo had been destroyed by bombing, and there was no way to know how his family was.

### Tibetan Representatives to the National Assembly Speak; Do Not Intend to Raise Political Issues; Request Economic Assistance and Cultural Exchange

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 7th] According to Shen Zonglian, Director of the Central Government's Office in Tibet, and Zha Sang Sangma Tudan Sangpi, Tibetan representative to the National Assembly, who spoke to our reporter, education in Tibet's pastoral society still requires much effort.

Silver coins are now commonly used, with each silver coin worth about 8 Tibetan coins, and each Tibetan coin worth about 500 legal tender yuan.

When the meeting encountered obstacles, the United States, the Nationalists, and the Communists decided to send a telegram to the three commissioners in Beiping, requesting a new explanation and clarification on whether the "ceasefire" order of the Executive Headquarters applies to the Communist Party's recent demand to have the same right as the National Army to take over the Northeast. This division will remain unresolved until the telegram from Beiping is received. The two executive teams departing on the 8th only have orders to "adjust the deployment of troops." General Beall, due to other important business, will go to Beiping and is temporarily replaced by Colonel Dutille as the chairman of the three-man group meeting. During the meeting, the Communist Party strongly advocated that the Communist army should have the same right as the National Army to take over the Northeast from the Soviet army.

He was very optimistic about the peace in the Northeast, explained the mediation work, and emphasized the importance of peace in the Northeast to peace in China and the world. Wu Haoding said in his speech: "In the present time of the restoration of our great rivers and mountains, it is extremely pleasant to have such a grand event in the city of Shenyang," and he expressed his infinite hope for the future prosperity and happiness of China.

We oppose the act of practicing separatism in the name of false democracy. Today, all parties and factions in and out of the government must put the interests of the country and the people first in order to gain the sympathy of the people. In the political sphere, it is first necessary to eliminate the professionalization of political officials and the servility of administrative officials. In the economic sphere, increasing production is the most important task at present. In the military sphere, political orders and military orders must be unified. In the diplomatic sphere, we should get along with our neighbors in accordance with the principles of equality and mutual benefit. We oppose all secret diplomacy.

### United Nations Staff Group Drafts Plan to Maintain Peace by Force to Prevent and Suppress Acts of Aggression: US Advocates Transfer of Italian Territories to the United Nations

[Reuters, New York, 7th] The United Nations Headquarters announced last night: The United Nations Chiefs of Staff, after twelve days of secret consultations, are currently drafting a plan to maintain world peace by military force when necessary. The members of the Staff Committee of the Security Council have now drafted a comprehensive plan for "joint action" by land, sea, and air forces for adoption by the United Nations to maintain world peace. The committee is an international staff group directly under the Security Council, and its mission is to prevent and suppress acts of aggression. Its plan has now been notified to the joint secretariat of the military delegations of the five powers of China, Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France.

[United Press, Washington, 7th] In order to break the deadlock in the peace talks among European countries, the United States is reportedly planning to propose the transfer of all pre-war colonies of Italy to the United Nations. This news was released today by diplomatic circles. At the same time, it was learned that Secretary of State Byrnes has invited Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, British Foreign Minister Bevin, and French Foreign Minister Bidault to hold a preparatory meeting of the four foreign ministers in Paris on the 25th of this month. Britain has already announced its agreement, and France is also expected to agree. However, the Soviet Union has remained silent so far. The Soviet Union had previously requested a postponement of the Paris Peace Conference scheduled for May 1. American officials have publicly expressed pessimism about the lack of progress in drafting peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland due to the many disagreements among the major powers. How to deal with the Italian colonies is one of the most difficult issues. The United States and Britain had originally proposed transferring them to the United Nations for joint management, while the Soviet Union advocated dividing them among countries for individual trusteeship, with Tripoli being entrusted to the Soviet Union. Britain has opposed this.

### Soviets Constructing Defense Works in the Kuril Islands: Munitions Piled Up Like Mountains, All of British and American Origin: Japanese Surrendered Troops Secretly Transported Elsewhere

[Reuters, London, 7th] "World News" recently published a report by correspondent Thomson after visiting a secret area, stating that the Soviet army is currently constructing military defense projects in the Kuril Islands, which it occupies north of Japan. It is noteworthy that the munitions piled up there are all of British and American origin. Other situations are as follows: (1) The Soviet army has not repatriated the Japanese surrendered troops in the Kuril Islands and southern Sakhalin Island. Thousands of Japanese soldiers in the Kuril Islands have been secretly transported by the Soviet army in "large ships" to unknown locations; (2) The Soviet army often patrols the islands near the area, and several places are very close to the American-occupied area, but the American army is now ordered to avoid them; (5) The Potsdam Declaration stipulates that Japan retains the main islands and about a thousand small islands nearby. The Soviet army does not participate in the occupation of Japan. However, the Soviet army has now occupied Etorofu Island in addition to Sakhalin Island, and several islands along the coast. However, the American military spokesperson still refuses to discuss this matter; (4) The American army has not yet effectively occupied the northern part of Etorofu Island. The area is not within the jurisdiction of the Soviet army, but Soviet officers also visit it. The American military spokesperson said that he had received such reports, but had not been able to confirm them; (5) The territorial waters around the Kuril Islands are the best fishing grounds in the world. MacArthur now apparently wants to avoid trouble and has restricted Japanese fishermen to fishing within three miles of the shore; (6) There is a shortage of food for the residents of the Kuril Islands, which has gradually become a crisis. They serve in the Soviet army but receive no food or wages; (7) A large number of Soviet women have arrived on the island, all with the status of "officers". The Soviet army is now transporting various munitions to the Kuril Islands and is building a large airfield. It is also hiring Japanese people to install cannons along the coast targeting the American-controlled area. This is the recent situation on the island. The archipelago consists of thirty-two volcanoes and is about seven hundred miles from the northeastern coast of Siberia.

In Yexie Town, under the jurisdiction of this county, a villager was shot dead by a police officer and five others were seriously injured due to a lantern festival-related incident.  Details of this were reported yesterday.

Xu Gui, a native of Yixing, the former head of the "Jiangsu Civil Affairs Department," previously served as the chief of the Nantong Public Security Bureau, the county magistrate of Jinshan, and an inspector of the Jiangsu Provincial Government before the war. In 1940, due to the adverse turn of the war situation, his will wavered, and he was recommended by Ren Nidao, the commander-in-chief of the pseudo-First Route Army, to successively hold pseudo-positions. After the victory, he was captured by the Wujin County Government and handed over to the High Procuratorate for investigation. The investigation has now concluded, and he has been indicted in the criminal court.

Trial Runs on the Koucheng Routes to Begin Today

Lihang Automobile Company of this county, jointly operated by locals such as Han Xinshan, operated the Koutai and Chenghuang routes before the incident and was prospering. Travelers found it very convenient. Later, due to enemy and puppet intrusion, operations were suspended.

It is heard that trial runs on the Koutai route will begin soon.

Wuhu

Agricultural Loans Handled by the Anhui Agricultural Bank

The branches of the Chinese Farmers Bank in various parts of Anhui, with the request and assistance of the Anhui Relief Branch, have begun to handle agricultural loans. The loans are divided into categories such as draft cattle, crops, seeds, small farm tools, and fertilizers. The quotas are set at 50 million yuan each for the four items of draft cattle, seeds, etc., and 500 million yuan each for the four items of tea, tobacco, cotton, and silk in the Qimen black tea area of southern Anhui, the Qing tea area of western Anhui, the Tunxi green tea area, and the tobacco, cotton, and silk areas of northern Anhui. The targets are legal cooperatives and farmers' associations, as well as farmers who share the distribution of agricultural materials from the relief agency and jointly use wells and ponds that have been dug.

Illegal Money Houses Exploit with Usurious Interest After Wuhu was recovered, general speculative merchants, seeing the direct rise in prices, opened money houses one after another, pre-collecting heavy interest of 20,000 to 30,000 yuan for every 100,000 yuan loaned to merchants and "errand boys." Money houses are not allowed to be established without the approval of the Ministry of Finance, but these people bribed local governments with heavy sums to obtain a business license and immediately made huge profits, reaching as many as thirty or forty at one time. Although the provincial government recently sent a telegram strictly prohibiting them, they continue to operate secretly as usual. Assuming that each of the thirty houses loans a minimum of 20 million yuan, they can absorb 15 million yuan in heavy interest each month. It is no wonder that prices only rise and never fall.

Huzhou

Hangchang Bus Robbed by Bandits

Recently, bandit alarms have been frequent in the rural areas of Huzhou, and robbery cases have occurred one after another.

They then robbed the passengers one by one, taking away all the cash and valuables they had. The bandits then left triumphantly. After counting the losses, it was estimated that they amounted to 20 million yuan. After the bus returned to Huzhou, the incident was reported to higher authorities, who requested that the relevant authorities be instructed to jointly investigate the case.

### Secrets Revealed by a Dancer  Japan Hid Large Amounts of Platinum Planning "Revival of Japan" Capital  Allies Are Salvaging in Tokyo Bay

[Reuters, Tokyo, 7th] Following the discovery of valuable metals worth 50 million pounds sterling in Tokyo Bay, the Allied government has dispatched investigators to search throughout Japan for Japanese officers who hid the metals in Tokyo Bay. The Americans have now discovered platinum worth 12,500 pounds sterling hidden under a damaged pier, eight feet deep in the water. It is believed that the metals were buried before Japan's surrender, with the intention of using them as capital for the "revival of Japan" in the future. This information was gleaned from a Japanese dancer, who claimed that two truckloads of gold, silver, and platinum were hidden under the supervision of Japanese officers in July of last year by Japanese laborers in Tokyo Bay. Now that the Allies have discovered the metals, they will continue to salvage them.

Editorial

### The Northeast in the Next Two Weeks

According to a Reuters dispatch from Chongqing on the 7th, observers today predict that whether the mediation team of the Peiping Executive Headquarters can save the Northeast from a large-scale war, and whether the Soviet Union's promise to withdraw from the Northeast can proceed smoothly with the National Army's takeover, will be severely tested in the next two weeks. The dispatch on the 6th also stated that observers are closely watching the developments in the Northeast situation in the next ten days, believing that this matter has a significant relationship with the situation in the next few years. If we, the ordinary people, are not overwhelmed by "victory" and dream of complacency, then we should not be indifferent to the increasingly serious situation in the Northeast.

The military three-person team in Chongqing was originally scheduled to fly to Peiping and then to Shenyang on the 5th, but there has been no news of departure to date. Moreover, according to the telegrams received as of last night, it is widely rumored that the three-person team's trip to the Northeast has been postponed indefinitely, and meetings have not even been held in Chongqing. Although the executive team departing from Peiping has gone to the Northeast, the so-called "Communist Army" has gathered 60,000 to 70,000 people in the suburbs of Changchun, with its vanguard only seven or eight kilometers from the city, and constantly sending plainclothes teams to sneak into the city. Harbin is also extremely tense, and military conflicts in various places have not stopped, and instead, there is a tendency to expand. It is likely that the Soviet army in Changchun will be completely withdrawn by the 15th, the Soviet army in Harbin will be completely withdrawn by the 25th, the Soviet army in Jilin City will be completely withdrawn by the 16th, and the Soviet army in Qiqihar will be completely withdrawn by the 27th, while the so-called "Communist Army" has long been plotting to occupy the area as soon as the Soviet army withdraws, in order to prevent the National Government from restoring national sovereignty. We fought a bloody war for eight years to recover the Northeast, and now that we have finally achieved victory, there are actually people using foreign forces to cover up their actions that harm the country and the people, which cannot be tolerated.

Originally, the military and political orders of a country should be absolutely unified. Allowing parties to possess armies within a country, and even further recognizing the Communist Army as a unit and executing mediation between the Communist Army and the government army, is already a ridiculous joke from the standpoint of strict military discipline. However, in order to implement peace and stop conflicts, and in order to allow the people to recuperate and recuperate after the war, the National Government has actually agreed to establish a military mediation executive department, and the military two-person team has negotiated a basic plan for reorganizing the National Army and integrating the Communist troops into the National Army, giving the Communist Army a legitimate way out and an opportunity to be loyal to the motherland, which can be considered as benevolent and righteous. According to the measures for stopping conflicts and restoring transportation agreed upon by the government and the Communist Party representatives on January 10 with the assistance of Special Envoy Marshall, it was originally stipulated that "Section 2 of the order to stop conflicts does not affect the National Government's troops entering the nine northeastern provinces or being transferred within the nine northeastern provinces to restore sovereignty." It can be seen that, internally, the so-called military mediation measures were originally not applicable to the Northeast. Furthermore, from an external perspective, according to the spirit of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance and its annexed regulations, the Soviet government should take the National Government as the object of assistance, and receiving sovereignty over the Northeast is especially the National Government's undeniable responsibility. Therefore, since the Soviet army has declared that it will complete its withdrawal from the Northeast by the end of April, from the perspective of morality and treaties, the Soviet army has the obligation to facilitate and assist the Chinese National Government's replacement troops. However, the current situation is that the Soviet army's withdrawal is precisely when the Communist Party's so-called "Democratic Allied Army" is stirring up trouble in various parts of the Northeast to the point of being ready. The Communist troops are not allowing the National Army to smoothly accomplish the task of receiving sovereignty over the Northeast, which is truly a case of "Sima Zhao's intentions are known to all." The Communist Party attempts to collude with the Soviet Union externally to transform the Northeast situation, which was originally a diplomatic issue, into an internal political dispute within China, thereby deceiving people all over the world. However, for the sake of Sino-Soviet friendship, far-sighted politicians in the Soviet Union should not be misled by the Communist Party. However, no matter how complicated the situation has been made by the Communist Party, we should always recognize the nature of the Northeast issue. Standing in the position of pure nationals, we must not allow any party or individual to negotiate and coerce the government at this time, relying on its unexplained military force, to arbitrarily occupy the Northeast, obstruct the recovery of national sovereignty, and hinder the integrity of national administration. Regardless of whether it is the "Democratic Allied Army" or the "popularly elected government," before the National Government receives sovereignty over the Northeast and implements the country's administrative power, there is absolutely no room for recognition. If the National Government does not adhere to this position, I am afraid there will be a day when it will be too late to regret!

The Northeast is China's treasure, and the Northeast is China's lifeline. We Chinese people do not know how much blood we have shed and how much suffering we have endured for the Northeast. We Chinese people, for the sake of the Northeast, first raised the banner of anti-aggression throughout the world and fought against the violent Japanese at all costs. Now, half a year after the victory, the factory machinery in the Northeast has been emptied! The mines in the Northeast have been destroyed! The houses in the Northeast have been demolished! The materials in the Northeast have been stolen! The transportation in the Northeast has either been destroyed or blocked! The personnel receiving the Northeast have either been brutally murdered or blocked from entering! Now that the Soviet army is withdrawing as a result of repeated negotiations, it still cannot allow the National Government to smoothly receive sovereignty and implement administrative orders. As long as they are truly Chinese, there is no one who does not feel heartbroken; as long as they are truly Chinese, there is no one who does not gnash their teeth.

Before leaving Changchun, Soviet Marshal Malinovsky repeatedly emphasized the importance and inevitability of friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union; the Soviet Moscow News also said that China is a neighbor of the Soviet Union and has always maintained friendship with the Soviet Union. For the sake of peace in the Northeast, for the sake of peace in the Far East, and for the sake of world peace, we indeed always agree with the Soviet Union that the friendly relationship between China and the Soviet Union should be maintained 100%. However, friendship must have a genuine foundation of friendship, and friendship must have a genuine object of friendship. We are willing to frankly offer two sentences to the Soviet authorities and people: (1) The foundation of Sino-Soviet friendship should be built on the words and spirit of the "Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance," and should be built on the sincerity of the two countries' authorities and people. (2) The object of Sino-Soviet friendship, in terms of government, is the government led by Marshal Stalin in the Soviet Union, and the National Government led by Chairman Chiang in China; in terms of people, it should be all the peace-loving people of the Soviet Union in the Soviet Union, and all the peace-loving people of China in China. Therefore, instead of simply trying to curry favor with the Chinese Communist Party, why not show sincerity and trust to the entire Chinese people? Instead of giving the Communist Party the convenience of occupying the Northeast after withdrawing troops, why not assist the National Government in completing the task of receiving sovereignty in accordance with the spirit of the alliance? We sincerely hope to see the friendly relationship between China and the Soviet Union last for at least thirty years, and the longer the better; but we certainly do not want Sino-Soviet friendship to be like the "friendship" that the Japanese used to talk about between China and Japan. Only the sincere friendship between China and the Soviet Union, only the genuine assistance of the Soviet Union to the National Government, and only the complete recovery of China's sovereignty and territorial integrity in the Northeast can provide a powerful guarantee for peace in the Northeast, peace in the Far East, and even world peace. Otherwise, the day when the Soviet army completely withdraws from the Northeast will be the time when the Communist Party harasses and occupies the area! If so, the Chinese people cannot forgive the Communist Party for its crimes of harming the country and the people. Even towards the friendly allied Soviet Union, if it does not withdraw its troops early or late, but waits until the illegal troops of the Communist Party are prepared to obstruct the National Army's reception work to implement the withdrawal, and does not fulfill its obligation to assist the National Government, we cannot help but feel great regret!

### Can Be Realized in the Near Future Opening Over a Hundred Warehouses Large Quantities of Enemy and Puppet Materials Stored Will Be Publicly Tendered or Auctioned Responsible Person of the Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau Discusses the Situation of Reception

In order to clear out warehouses and supply the market with large quantities of materials, the Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau will open more than 120 enemy and puppet warehouses in the near future and publicly tender or auction the materials stored inside. After these warehouses are cleared out, they will be used to store relief materials from the China Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and surplus materials from the US military in the Pacific region, which are currently being shipped to China. It is believed that these measures will have a significant effect on suppressing prices. In order to understand the truth of this move, the reporter visited the person in charge of the bureau, who said: This bureau was established two and a half months after the victory. Fortunately, with the assistance of all parties since May, the work has been seen to advance. The most prominent aspects are: (1) In the absence of a joint office of the customs at the wharf warehouse, there is also a company of military police and tax police stationed in each warehouse to assist in guarding. As of March 17, there were 1,136 warehouses sealed and managed by the customs. (2) The tallying of 1,087 warehouses has been completed, and the customs has sent tallying reports to the bureau for 900 warehouses. The rest are being tallied and registered. There are about 200 warehouses of Allied merchants. Half of the materials that have been tallied have been returned to their original owners. There are 139 warehouses of Chinese merchants and banks, which are being actively cleared, identifying materials, and returning them separately, or entrusting various agencies and groups to sell them by warehouse according to regulations, or selling them by warehouse by the bureau. It is expected that one-half to two-thirds of all warehouses can be emptied before the end of April. (3) 626 units of factories have been received by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. A total of 142 units have been transferred to the Assets Committee, the Textile Committee, the China Silk Company, the Ministry of Health, and the Ministry of Food for reception; a total of 148 units have been returned; a total of 103 factories have resumed work; a total of 217 factories that can be tendered for sale have been proposed by the Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. (4) More than 800 units of real estate have been entrusted to the Central Trust Bureau for reception, with 1,620 buildings and more than 1,000 acres of land, all of which are to be sold in principle. (5) The solid and liquid fuels are complex in variety. The fuels received by the Fuel Management Committee include 1,080 barrels of gasoline, 55,595.950 tons of bituminous coal, and 142,194.175 tons of anthracite coal. (6) Allied officials and merchants have applied for the return of 132 cars. In terms of air transport, the Aviation Committee has received seven airfields and 170 aircraft. (7) The main food items are flour, corn, soybeans, and sorghum, which have been received by the Commissioner of the Ministry of Food and will be put up for a third public tender of miscellaneous grains. (7) There are a total of 219 educational and cultural institutions. It was also stated that the initial estimate of the total value of the enemy and puppet properties received in Shanghai as of February 20 was approximately 607 billion yuan. This valuation is mostly low and is based on the Shanghai market price at the end of December 1934.

### The City Provisional Council Has Received Sixteen Petitions

Sorted into Four Categories

After the opening of the City Provisional Council, a total of sixteen petitions were received from citizens, which have been sorted into four categories: (1) Five items related to industry and commerce; (2) Four items related to education; (3) Three items related to housing and land; (4) Four items in other categories.

### To Solve the Serious Electricity Problems in This City Shanghai Power Company Prepares a Three-Year Plan Yesterday's Banquet for City Government Officials and Provisional Councilors  Afternoon Visit to Various Parts of the Power Plant

[Report from this newspaper] He Qing, President of the Shanghai Power Company, and Fei Lisi, General Manager, etc., hosted a banquet at noon yesterday on the 14th floor of the International Hotel for members of the City Provisional Council and City Government officials. Mayor Qian, Xu Jiyu, directors of various bureaus, councilors, and more than sixty other people attended. During the banquet, Mr. He gave a speech, reporting on the company's business and requesting Councilor Gu to give guidance at any time, so that the city's electricity problem could be solved satisfactorily. Mayor Qian, Xu Jiyu, Zhao Zengjue, and others then gave speeches, expressing their gratitude for the Shanghai Power Company's service to the citizens of the city. Deputy Director Wang Shenshan of the Public Works Bureau translated. The banquet ended at 3:30 p.m., and the attendees then visited the company's power plant in Yangshupu. They were divided into small groups of ten people, led by the plant's engineers to explain the workings of each department. They first went to the steam cooling room, then to the coal transportation area, boiler room, power generation room, general management office, power grid room, and other departments. The plant is large in scale, and all departments are operated by machinery, requiring only a very small number of workers to manage the oiling and calibration work, etc., which is a highly advanced factory organization. However, before the victory, Allied aircraft bombed the power generation room, completely destroying one generator and partially destroying another. These are currently being repaired. In addition, one generator was dismantled by the enemy and transported to Japan. There is also a Skoda machine made in Czechoslovakia, which was installed before the war but has not been used to this day. During the enemy's management period, they planned to use it, but they damaged it in many places because they did not know how to use it. This machine has extremely strong power generation capacity, but if it is to be repaired now, it must be transported back to the original factory in Czechoslovakia for reassembly. At this time after the war, European transportation has not yet recovered, so the plan to transport the machine to Czechoslovakia for repair cannot be implemented for the time being. Since September 17, the company has taken on the full power supply tasks of the Zhabei, Huashang, and Pudong companies, with a total generating capacity of approximately 123,000 kilowatts. However, the coal reserves are often only enough for one or two days or several hours. Fortunately, the US and China authorities have managed to assist in providing supplies in a timely manner, but this situation cannot be a long-term solution. It is hoped that all citizens of the city will cooperate, save electricity, and that Huashang, Pudong, Zhabei, and other power sales companies will do their best to assist. Currently, the French Water and Electricity Company can still supply a small portion of electricity. In terms of economics, since its reception, the company's total losses have exceeded 3 billion yuan. A three-year plan is being drawn up to solve the city's serious electricity problems: (1) The materials manufactured in the United States for the Shanghai Power Company must be quickly airlifted to Shanghai. (2) One 10,000-kilowatt generator at the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company should be quickly repaired and put into use. (3) The 24,000-kilowatt floating generator being purchased by President Song should be used for Shanghai. (4) The Shanghai Power Company must purchase and install one 20,000-kilowatt low-voltage generator and one 15,000-kilowatt high-voltage generator. (5) The 22,500-kilowatt generator rotor being repaired in the United States must be repaired and returned to Shanghai. In this way, the power generation capacity can be increased to 200,000 in 1946, 204,500 kilowatts in 1947, and 239,500 kilowatts in 1948.

### The Most Luxurious Cars Not Allowed in Shanghai

The Import Management Office of the Customs had previously stipulated that cars of a certain category must apply for a permit before they can be imported, limiting their factory price to within US$1,200, and prohibiting import if this number is exceeded. A reporter learned from the import and export industry yesterday that the most luxurious American cars, such as the "Lincoln" brand, have horn sounds that form the musical notes "1281." There is also a new product with a glass convertible top that can be opened and closed automatically, but the selling price is all above US$1,200. Therefore, this kind of magnificent car will not appear in Shanghai.

### Pickpocket Steals "Shi Ji Ben Ji," Petty Thief Apes Royalty, Impersonates Government Official, Cleverly Steals Briefcase and Flees to Shanxi, Meets a Soulmate in Another Land and Returns, Impersonates Seal Paper and Treachery Exposed

[Report from this newspaper] The famous pickpocket nicknamed Xiao Hebei Chen Qiming, 25 years old, makes pickpocketing his regular occupation and has committed numerous crimes. A month ago, Chen stole a briefcase containing important documents from the Military Statistics Bureau, including a letter from the late Director Dai, the highest person in charge of the Military Statistics Bureau. Based on the research of the documents, it was determined that the person who lost the important document was Qi Yimin, a senior official of the Military Statistics Bureau. Xiao Hebei Chen Qiming had a whimsical idea and used the documents as a talisman, openly impersonating the Military Statistics Bureau to engage in something.

However, Chen knew that he was notorious for committing crimes in Shanghai, and many people knew his face, so it was inconvenient for him to stay there permanently. So, he took the important documents with him and carved a seal of the "Investigation Office of the Military Affairs Commission of the National Government," as well as a personal seal of Director Dai, and went to Shanxi Province to carry out large-scale activities. He actually took this opportunity to transform from a "petty thief" into a "government official." Later, he met a pickpocket named Sun Zigao in Shanxi (19 years old, from Henan, also making a living by pickpocketing, committed two crimes in Shanghai). They were in sync with each other and colluded with each other.

Until recently, Chen and Sun returned to Shanghai for the second time, living in room 11 of the Shandong Hotel at No. 491 Jiujiang Road. They privately printed a large number of letterhead and envelopes of the "Investigation Office of the Military Affairs Commission" at a printing factory, preparing to take them to Shanxi for use. Unexpectedly, a staff member of the Military Statistics Bureau was also entrusting the printing factory to print other items and glimpsed the large number of stationery printed by Chen, which he found strange. After returning to the bureau and inquiring, no one had entrusted the printing of these items, so it was determined that they were privately printed for illegal purposes. Personnel were dispatched to secretly wait at the printing factory. When Chen went to pick up the goods, he was arrested.

After strict interrogation by the Military Statistics Bureau, Chen knew that it was difficult to hide and admitted to forging the documents. He confessed everything that had happened. They then rushed to the Shandong Hotel and captured his accomplice, Sun Zigao, who immediately surrendered. The bureau believed that the case involved impersonation and unauthorized engraving of seals, which was an act of disrespect for the law. The two criminals were escorted to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for interrogation according to law.

### City Government Plans to Build 2,000 Public Housing Units

A person in charge of the city government said that the housing shortage in the city needs to be resolved urgently. The city government has drafted a plan and budget to build 2,000 public housing units and submitted it to the central government for approval.

### Longhua After the Robbery

Having been away from Longhua for nearly eight years,

The remaining scenery after the robbery is even more pitiful;

The cherry blossom festival in Eastern Ying is gorgeous,

But how can it compare to the ancient temple by the spring river?

If we

Describe Longhua more precisely, Longhua Ancient Temple and Longhua Pagoda seem to have become Shanghai people's Mecca. During the Spring Festival holidays, it is a must-go place. But after all, it could not escape the clutches of the invaders. The temple was shattered, fortunately, the seven-story pagoda has not been robbed. The reconstruction and repair project of the temple began in the autumn of the 32nd year of the Republic of China, with the assistance of Huang Jinrong, the great protector, and Zhang Fanggeng, a Buddhist layman. It is now said that 80% of the project has been completed. The reporter wants to find an opportunity to see the new Longhua in person.

Yesterday, the abbot of Longhua Ancient Temple, Shi Shibin, hosted a press conference. The reporter had been away from Longhua for eight years, and it was a special feeling to revisit the old place. On Longhua Road, all kinds of transportation were mobilized. Tourists are like the mountain road in Shanyin, there are old ladies carrying pilgrimage bags, there are young men and women in gorgeous clothes going for an outing, there are neat US military officers, there are boastful scout troops... Next to the temple, there are many simple food shops, but every one is full of guests. Inside and outside the temple, there are many candle and snack stalls, and passers-by are willing to buy a skewer of small tofu, chewing it in their mouths, looking at the green of the fields, it seems that they can wash away the vulgarity of the city!

The tourists in various parts of the temple are like the flood of a tributary, constantly bustling. A batch of red candles on the candlestick has just been taken away, and another batch is lit and inserted. The grand bell and giant drum placed high on the two corners of the temple, the devout men and women could not avoid spending one hundred yuan to climb up the stage and hit or beat them three times, which is said to be able to eliminate disasters and bring good fortune. Some of the 108 Arhats in the Arhat Hall look dark, it is said that there is a lack of gold plating funds, each statue costs 25,000 yuan, many devout men and women put legal tender in the hands of the Arhats. Although the famous Peach Garden has been renovated, the peach trees are pitifully sparse, and cannot hide the scars of the robbery. There is a monument in the garden commemorating the officers and soldiers of the 32nd Army of the National Revolutionary Army, as well as a monument with inscriptions and a list of officers and soldiers of the army, giving tourists meaningful warnings and inspirations!

Abbot Shi Shibin is already 53 years old. He is from Kunming, Yunnan, and has been working in the temple for only three years. He has a slender figure, his face is very dark, and he speaks with a rigid Yunnan accent, and he talks to reporters about the history of Longhua Temple. He said: This temple was founded in the fifth year of Chiwu in the Eastern Wu of the late Han Dynasty and the Three Kingdoms, and was built by Emperor Sun Quan of Wu... He also introduced his plan to preside over the temple, saying that it will be based on the four characters of "spreading the Dharma and benefiting sentient beings." Also, he wants to open a craft class, so that every junior can produce something besides chanting scriptures and worshiping Buddha. He expects that in less than five years, he will no longer rely on fundraising to raise funds for the temple...

Before leaving the temple, I will inevitably visit the pagoda. The crowd at the pagoda gate is like a tide, and it is easy to squeeze into the ranks of climbing the pagoda, climb the stairs, and look far away by leaning on the railing; the rolling waves of the Yangtze River protect the green wheat ridges, the endless vegetable garden, swaying in the wind with a brilliant golden color! On the ruins and dilapidated tiles, the red tiles are faintly visible... This glorious and splendid scenery symbolizes the rebirth of Longhua Ancient Temple, and the future of Shanghai and the motherland! (Canglong)

### Reasonable Distribution of Empty Houses Left by Japanese Nationals Planned, Detailed Rules to Be Announced After Approval

Recently, the work of sending back Japanese nationals in this city has achieved remarkable results. In order to prevent illegal entry into the empty houses left behind by Japanese nationals in this city, the municipal government, the Third Army Command, the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau, and the Songhu Garrison Headquarters will send responsible personnel to temporarily seal them, investigate them, and seek reasonable distribution. Yesterday at 2 PM, the War Prisoner Management Office of the Beijing-Shanghai Area held a press conference, presided over by Deputy Director Zou Renzhi and Municipal Government Advisor Dai Jimin. First, Zou reported that the task of the office was to repatriate Japanese nationals and prisoners of war, and that the remaining empty houses would be handled by the municipal government, the Third Army Command, and the Garrison Headquarters. Then, Advisor Dai explained the necessity of managing the empty houses left by Japanese nationals in this city and making reasonable distribution. The detailed rules for management have been drafted and will be announced after approval. A reporter asked whether the municipal government was responsible for the investigation and management of the empty houses left by Japanese nationals. Dai firmly denied it but said that they would be jointly managed. A reporter asked whether the application for use would have to be approved by the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau. Dai replied that except for enemy and puppet properties, approval from the bureau would not be required. A reporter asked whether the shops sealed by the Municipal Property Management Office and the empty houses left after the concentration of German nationals in this city would be managed together or distributed uniformly. Dai replied that they would not be merged, and he did not know the details of their sale or distribution. Finally, a reporter hoped that the houses sealed this time would be reasonably distributed and gave examples of the current unreasonable distribution situation, so he hoped that the handling methods would be more meticulous and fair in the future.

### Impoverished Unemployed Call for Donations to Cover Travel Expenses to Taiwan

Would Happily Take a Suitable Job Domestically

Mr. Editor—Forgive my lack of formality, but please allow me to use a corner of your newspaper to make an urgent appeal to all sectors of society! I am currently an impoverished person who has lost both schooling and employment. I grew up during the period of the puppet regime during the occupation and studied at a certain middle school for two years. Under the threat of the scourge of life, I finally dropped out of school. During these eight years, in order not to succumb to the enemy and not to betray my conscience, I embarked on the road of exile, wandering and enduring everything, even bleeding! I have seen the most cruel tragedies! But this life has made it impossible for me to breathe. I am almost on the verge of death. Although I am aware that if I continue to be unemployed like this, my future will be buried and my youth will be ruined, alas, who will understand and sympathize with me? After thinking about it, everything is a source of pain. But I still have a grandmother of high age and a hardworking father who does not resign. Why did they raise me? In great pain and disappointment, I ask for help from enthusiastic people from all walks of life in society. Please save this dying young man! The facts I am begging for are as follows: Recently, classmates in Taiwan wrote to me, asking me to go to work. I am also very willing to go to Taiwan, which has returned to the motherland, to develop and cultivate. What disappoints me now is that it takes a lot of travel expenses from Shanghai to Taiwan, and my family cannot afford it at all. I ran around for a few days and could not borrow any money. After selling all my belongings, it was still useless. Under these circumstances, I feel deeply disappointed and cry in pain. I have long known that you, sir, are enthusiastic and righteous, so I pray that you will do your best to give me appropriate assistance. I hope that enthusiastic people can give a little help. I will always be grateful and repay you. The requirements are as follows: (1) Who can lend me some legal tender, so that I can trade for a boat ticket to Taiwan, and I will return it on time, and sign a IOU in person. (2) I earnestly request your newspaper to inquire about all the procedures required to go to Taiwan, and how many days will it take for the ship to sail? (3) If there are enthusiastic people who care and rescue me, even if it is only for one night, seek shelter for me anywhere in the country, regardless of treatment, but only according to my ability. I wish you all the best to readers, Huai Pengfei. (Correspondence address: No. 2, Beishou, Shuigou Nong Nanpengxia, Xitang, Jiashan)

### Reply to Readers

Yan Sanle asks: I am a 28-year-old male, and in the past two or three years, the hair on the two corners above my forehead has gradually thinned, and the area of ​​bald skin has gradually expanded. Recently, I have also found that the hair on the area of ​​one inch on my ears seems to be there or not, which I think damages my appearance. Now I plan to ask (1) whether this phenomenon is congenital hereditary or acquired, such as caused by thinking too much or wearing hats often? Is it a pathological condition? (2) Is there any way to restore the original state or prevent further deterioration?

Dr. Tang Renjin answers: There are many reasons for hair loss, and those with a large range are difficult to treat, while those with a small range can try salicylic acid preparations. In addition, you can try taking blood tonics and ultraviolet irradiation.

Yang Baorun asks: Every time I see the noble enthusiasm of your column serving the society, I instinctively send out infinite admiration. I am an apprentice in the typesetting room of a printing factory. Every day, I have to focus my attention on individual lead characters, but in March and April last year, when my eyes touched the sky or white paper, walls, etc., in the vision of my right eye, I found a black spot the size of a rice grain rippling; when the eyeball moved, the black spot also floated up and down. I didn't care at the time. After two or three months, the black spot gradually grew into a black line about one inch long, slightly thinner than a matchstick. Please indicate: Is this black line caused by the friction of trachoma on the eyeball? How should it be treated to recover? Dr. Tang Renjin answers: This disease is vitreous opacity, which can be caused by high myopia, iritis, retinitis, choroiditis, and ciliary body diseases. It will not cause blindness, and iodine can be used for treatment.

### Chennault Plans to Return to the US to Summon Old Flying Tigers, Expedite Relief Supplies, and Form an Air Transport Team to Launch Operations in China

General Chennault told reporters yesterday that he will soon gather former members of the Flying Tigers to organize an air transport team for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to transport relief supplies to various disaster areas. Due to the lack of transportation infrastructure in China, air transport is the most effective way to ensure that relief supplies reach the disaster areas quickly without being obstructed or damaged en route. General Chennault will return to the US within the week to gather former Flying Tiger members and air force personnel willing to join the air transport team, enabling them to come to China from the US for service within a short period. At the same time, some of the US Air Force personnel in China will also serve under Chennault after their demobilization. The organization will operate with a small number of personnel to handle the busy transportation work. The total number of staff in the air transport team is tentatively set at 350. Air transport bases will be established in Hankou, Shanghai, Hunan, Henan, Guangdong, and other regions to expedite the delivery of relief supplies to the most severely affected areas. Chennault's general transportation base will be located in Hankou, from where supplies will be distributed to various disaster areas in the future. Regarding the issue of aircraft, General Chennault believes it will be easily resolved. The air transport team's aircraft can be purchased from the US Foreign Liquidation Commission in the Philippines. Because the current US military transport aircraft in China are difficult to adapt for civilian use. Finally, Chennault stated that he will handle all matters properly during his return to the US and will immediately set off for China to launch operations. It is also understood that Chennault has detailed plans with UNRRA, which will be announced by UNRRA within a day or two.

### Commodity Prices Stabilized Last Week, Speculation Concentrated on Securities, Tong Bing Surpasses 4,000 Mark, New and Old Hong Kong Dollar Notes Converge

Commodity prices gradually stabilized last week, factories resumed work one after another, production increased, and market inventories grew daily. In the financial sector, gold and banknotes remained stable, and speculative activities concentrated on government bonds and stocks, resulting in repeated peaks. Although the impact is relatively minor, it is not a normal market state, and it is significantly related to the future of industrial and commercial recovery. Therefore, all parties hope that the authorities will determine a handling method as soon as possible. A summary is provided below.

Silver Futures: Last week, the highest price for silver futures was 1.55 million and the lowest was 1.38 million. Fluctuations were due to good actual sales from silver shops and sufficient offsetting. Furthermore, there were many instances of arbitrage and profit-taking, resulting in a market situation of sudden rises and falls. The overall trend for the week was relatively stable, with the opening price on Monday at 1.51 million and the closing price on Saturday at 1.48 million, a decrease of 25,000 yuan compared to the previous weekend.

Foreign Exchange: The exchange rate of the Central Bank against the US dollar remained unchanged at 2020 yuan. The trend of US dollars was calm, but money exchange shops and members opened more positions. Last week, it fluctuated around 1900, with a high of 1960 and a low of 1860 yuan. The final price at the weekend was 1905 yuan, a decrease of 25 yuan compared to last week. The Hong Kong dollar market was sluggish on Monday. By Wednesday, due to Western newspaper reports that the Hong Kong government announced that new and old notes were indistinguishable and universally accepted, public confidence strengthened, and buying sentiment was strong. Many people were selling old notes and buying new ones. New notes soared from over 200 yuan to 340 yuan, while old notes fell. From Thursday to Saturday, old notes fluctuated weakly, while new notes remained firm. As a result, the prices of new and old notes almost converged.

Government Bonds: On Monday and Tuesday, affected by the decline of Overseas Chinese stocks, the black market continued to weaken. Tong Bing once fell to 2420 yuan, and A, B, D, and E shares also decreased by about 150 yuan each. On Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, due to the increased absorption in the black market and the stimulus of new Hong Kong dollar notes being universally accepted like old notes, public confidence improved, and all government bonds rose. Tong Bing rose from 2950 yuan to 4000 yuan. At the weekend, due to the tireless efforts of peers, prices soared again. Tong Bing reached 4550 yuan, and Tong E was actively traded, rising to 2650 yuan, 400 yuan higher than types A and B.

Stocks: At the beginning of the week, Overseas Chinese stocks were high and people were worried, so they sold and closed positions, leading to a sluggish market. Foreign stocks also declined. The next day, many Overseas Chinese and foreign stocks were sold off, and prices fell steadily. On Wednesday, Overseas Chinese stocks turned to the upside due to the return of speculative funds. Foreign stocks opened quite briskly, but later became weak due to frequent sales. In the afternoon, there was a slight rebound. On Thursday, Overseas Chinese and foreign stocks rose due to the activity of speculative funds. On Friday, Overseas Chinese stocks were initially very enthusiastic, but later became unsustainable due to more sales. Foreign stocks rallied and then fell, following the same pattern as Overseas Chinese stocks. At the weekend, Overseas Chinese stocks were initially firm, but later entered a hovering state, resulting in lower prices overall. Foreign stocks also declined.

Grains: At the beginning of the week, the consumption of rice increased sharply, rebounding by 500 yuan. Flour exports were sluggish, falling by 300-400 yuan. Sugar prices were weak due to the continued sales by the Enemy Property Administration Bureau. The next day, the grain market fluctuated up and down. Glutinous rice fell the most sharply. No. 1 warship and artillery flour both approached the 9,000 mark, and soybeans also declined by several hundred yuan. However, raw peanuts stood out, rising by 1,000-2,000 yuan. On Wednesday, rice turned from weak to stable, flour's decline slowed down, and the number of buyers of edible oil increased sharply, with prices rising by 3,000 yuan. On Thursday, grains and edible oil turned to the downside. Due to the abundance of goods in the market and the lack of confidence among peers, the sugar market worsened. From Friday to the weekend, the grain market was closed due to the holiday.

Raw Yarn: In the past week, initially supported by the previous weekend's rally, long positions were aggressively pushed up, and major buyers from Guangdong and Hubei were actively purchasing, leading to a sharp rise in fine yarn, which created a new high price. Subsequently, due to the lack of development in gold and stocks, the actual demand from buyers weakened, and long positions sold off at high prices. Short positions took advantage of the situation to exert pressure, and the weekend saw a sharp downturn. The highest price for the week was 3.01 million for No. 6 Shanghai Branch Nikko double-strand fine yarn on Wednesday, and the lowest was 530,000 for No. 10 Jiahe yarn on Saturday. The current yarn market is characterized by fine yarn being weak and unstable while coarse yarn is stable. This is largely because current flower prices are cheap, and factories can make substantial profits by buying flowers and spinning yarn, especially fine yarn. Therefore, the Spinning Construction Corporation is taking over Japanese-owned yarn factories and actively producing and selling yarn in the market, increasing the inventory in Shanghai. Furthermore, the peak sales season has passed. If buyers lack large sales channels, the future market trend is likely to be prone to decline rather than rise.

Cloth Market: Initially stable, but later, as more buyers and shopkeepers adopted a wait-and-see approach, the market was flooded with inventory. Many factories were selling, and long positions with inventory also adopted a depreciated sales approach. On Saturday, Daming Fu silk fell by 68,000 yuan, 6,000 yuan lower than the previous Saturday. The trend of Shilin cloth, which fell by 3,000-4,000 yuan each, 12-pound Longtou fine cloth and 16-pound coarse cloth seemed more moderate, showing a mediocre situation. The flower market was weak due to the weakness of cotton yarn and cotton cloth, and prices also decreased slightly by 2,000-3,000 yuan.

### UNRRA Prepares US$100 Million to Purchase Materials for Relief in China, Including Ships, Food, and Medicine

(Reuters, New York, 7th) Howard, Director of the Pacific Region of the US Foreign Liquidation Commission, announced that the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration is preparing to purchase surplus US Army and Navy ships, medicines, and food for US$100 million for relief in China. He stated that the disposal of these surplus materials will at least allow the United States to abandon three bases. Of the aforementioned US$100 million, US$40 million will be used to purchase ships and port equipment, 50,000 tons of flour, beans, and other dry food, and medicines. UNRRA has already used US$30 million to purchase property from the Foreign Liquidation Commission for use in China. As a result of the above measures implemented by the United States, every dollar of cost can recover 37 cents.

### Vietnamese Rice Difficult to Export

[Reuters, Paris Report] According to reports from Vietnam, at the end of January, the rice inventory in the Saigon-Cholon area was about 59,000 tons. In addition, 39,000 tons of rice were found in the warehouses of the Japanese Mitsui & Co., Ltd. This inventory was earmarked for use by the British army. The rice inventory in the interior of Vietnam is estimated at about 185,000 tons, but as of now, the Allied forces have not been able to control it. On the other hand, consumption in the Saigon-Cholon area is about 8,500 tons per month. In addition, 13,000 tons of rice were shipped to the Tokyo area in January to relieve local famine, and another 15,000 tons were shipped in February. Therefore, Vietnam will have no surplus rice for export this year.

### Tinplate Softens

Tinplate prices were once quite firm due to the sharp increase in actual sales, but since the end of last month, they have shown signs of recession again. Buying prices have gradually softened. This is certainly due to a sharp decrease in demand and sluggish actual sales, but the rumor of overseas arrivals is also a factor. However, in reality, only dozens of boxes of double sheets were brought in from Hong Kong. However, people's pessimistic view is indeed the truth. Among various types of goods, double-count tinplate is more volatile. Recently, goods from Hong Kong are only selling for about 230,000 yuan per box. 200-pound company iron has also fallen sharply, with a bid of just over 200,000 yuan per box. However, 110-pound kerosene box blanks have changed little in price because actual sales are smoother.

Education and Sports

### Director Gu of the Municipal Education Bureau Discusses Post-War Japanese Education

[Central News Agency Report] Gu Yuxiu, Director of the Education Bureau, who recently returned to Shanghai from Japan to inspect education, told reporters: "I was ordered by Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Education to go to Japan for inspection, and the scope is not limited to post-war Japanese education. I left the country on February 25 and stayed in Tokyo, Yokosuka, Kure, Hiroshima, Osaka, Kobe, Kyoto, Gifu, Nagoya, and other places for about 30 days. I have made a general inspection of the educational facilities in various places and will submit a detailed report to the Ministry of Education for review. The post-war Japanese educational institutions are generally complete, and the facilities are also very sound. Except for special scientific research institutions that were suspended due to the war, the rest are still running normally, which is definitely not as badly damaged as in our country. The current trend in Japanese education is the same as in politics and economy. After the defeat in the war, there has been a transformation, and under the promotion and infusion of American educational thought, it has been automatically improved. During my stay in Japan, I met many professors from the Imperial University, who expressed their willingness to accept the new enlightenment of American education."

### The Education Bureau Sends Personnel to Take Over Zhenghang and Lehua Schools

[This City Report] A dispute arose over the issue of new and old principals at Zhenghang Girls' Middle School and Lehua Primary School in this city, resulting in the forced takeover by armed soldiers, which led to the intervention of the Garrison Command. In addition, the school's early spring break caused students and teachers to petition. Since the school board of directors could not be reorganized within a short period of time, the school's dispute could not be resolved smoothly. In order to maintain students' studies, the Municipal Education Bureau specially appointed Chu Fengyi, a member of the school's board of directors, to temporarily take over Zhenghang Girls' Middle School, and Hu Huiyuan to temporarily take over Lehua Primary School, so that school affairs can proceed as usual.

### Donghua Loses 1-2; Qingbai Wins Group A Championship; Yiyuan Stadium Sees Unprecedented Crowd of 20,000

In the final match of the Group A football league championship, Qingbai defeated Donghua 2-1 yesterday morning amidst an unprecedented crowd, winning the championship. No goals were scored in the second half. The game was tense and exciting, with an audience of over 20,000 at Yiyuan Stadium. All 16,000 pre-sold tickets were sold out before 9:00 AM. This led to complaints from fans who arrived later. A city stadium employee named Yang Jingwan was even beaten by unreasonable individuals. The ticket booths were stormed by those who couldn't buy tickets, and thieves seized over 300,000 yuan in ticket revenue, an unprecedented event in football matches.

Yesterday, Mayor Qian, Chairman Wu, and others attended the game. The order inside the stadium was initially well-maintained. However, about five minutes before the game started, because some team management needed to enter the field, the audience took the opportunity to push down the newly built but flimsy fence, swarming into the stadium and crowding along the white lines of the field. Although the game was able to proceed to the end smoothly, it was inevitably less than ideal due to the chaos.

Qingbai's Offense and Defense Were Both Excellent

Yesterday, the two teams were evenly matched. Qingbai's offense and defense were both excellent. The defenders Meng Yiliang and Yan Shixin made it difficult for the Donghua players A Dai, Long Hai, and Youliang to move and coordinate. The activity of the forwards Cao Qiuting and Li Yichen allowed them to control the offense in the first half. Donghua's one-goal deficit was simply a matter of luck in an otherwise even game.

First Half: Two to One

The game started at 10:10 AM, delayed due to the audience storming the field. With the whistle, Donghua took the lead. Less than three minutes into the first half, Li Zhuang scored. However, Qingbai became more courageous as the game went on. Li Yichen and Gu Yisa scored successively, putting Qingbai ahead 2-1 in the first half. No goals were scored in the second half. At the start of the game, Donghua passed the ball forward. Sun Jinshun received the ball and headed it to Li Yao. Li took a long shot, and the ball came straight down into the Qingbai goal. Qin Bi Gao jumped up to catch it but only managed to touch it with his fingers, and the ball went into the net. Donghua, taking advantage of the situation, was greatly encouraged by this unexpected goal. At this time, Qingbai focused on defense, with Yan Shixin single-handedly resisting the attacks, putting on an excellent performance. By the 25th minute, Qingbai counterattacked. Fei Chunhua got the ball and crossed it. Zhang Banglun created an open space, and Li Yichen took the opportunity to shoot, tying the score at 1-1. From then on, Qingbai became increasingly dominant. The forwards had more and more opportunities because they frequently received passes from the back. In the 40th minute, Fei Chunhua took a corner kick. Cao Qiuting hooked the ball back, placing it perfectly. Gu Yisa received the ball and volleyed it in, putting Qingbai ahead 2-1. Soon after, the first half ended, with Qingbai winning 2-1.

Donghua's Counterattack Ineffective

After the break, Donghua switched Youliang and Longhai's positions, and Zhuang Youren replaced Zhang Linggen, who moved forward. Donghua was determined to recover and initially showed a fierce momentum. In the fifth minute, Dai Linjing attempted an overhead kick from the ten-yard mark, but it was too weak and caught by Qin Bi Gao. Fifteen minutes later, Sun Jinshun took a long shot from twenty yards out. Qin caught it but then lost it, and Dai Linjing rushed up but was still saved by Qin. Donghua failed to score despite repeated attacks and inevitably became discouraged. Qingbai, having weathered the storm, became active again. Xu Wenkui was replaced by Luo Fufu due to a foot cramp. The new strength on the field also put in a lot of effort, so at this time, Donghua could not attack and was forced into a defensive position. Until the last five minutes, Meng Yiliang committed a foul, resulting in a free kick. Sun Jinshun took the free kick from within twenty yards, shooting it wonderfully. Qin Bi Gao jumped up and pushed it out, avoiding disaster. Donghua failed to score this goal and was unable to save the game, which ended abruptly.

They defeated the British effortlessly, 3-0 in the first half, and 5-1 in the end. The Soviet Union defeated the British Navy.

### How to Channel Floating Capital

— Xu Weizhou

Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the wealth of wealthy people in occupied areas has concentrated in Shanghai, which is considered safer and commercially more prosperous, to engage in the most secure hoarding or gold acquisition. This huge amount of floating capital, with no fixed date or direction, has been widely criticized. Because it goes to gold, gold prices soar; it goes to materials, material prices rise, causing hardship for the people and creating all kinds of unrest. Since the Central Bank openly supplies foreign exchange and gold, and goods gradually arrive in abundance, this terrible floating capital has turned to stocks. In recent weeks, stock prices have soared uncontrollably. If it is not properly guided, its harm to legitimate industrial and commercial enterprises is deeply worrying.

After the victory, the floating capital in the occupied areas was initially affected by the two-hundred-to-one exchange rate, and its fluctuating power weakened considerably. Since huge sums of money from the free areas have continued to be remitted; in addition to the banks, money shops, trusts, insurance, and various business companies organized during the enemy and puppet periods, although they have ostensibly ceased operations, many are still actively operating. Furthermore, due to the endless labor disputes and the dramatic increase in wages, the industrial and commercial enterprises that are preparing to proceed have found that there is no profit to be made, and have had to change course, and wait and see. As a result, the amount of floating capital is even greater than during the enemy and puppet periods. Once it flows into the stock market, stock prices soar and reach peak after peak. Although some stocks may be sold at a high price to purchase the latest equipment to increase future output, it must be known that the management rights are not lost after the stocks are sold. Investors must pay close attention to whether these managers are completely stable and reliable. The rubber stock affair at the end of the Qing Dynasty is still vivid in our minds. I am not deliberately creating alarm, but confirming what you are hearing. Today's investors in stocks may not be without such caution, but with the widespread mentality of valuing things and devaluing money, everyone is trying to profit in the short term, and often does not have time to consider the actual value of the stock itself. Therefore, I believe that the stock exchange urgently needs to resume operations and should not be delayed any longer. Only in this way can the assets of listed stocks be examined, and the production, sales status, and whether the stocks that directors and supervisors should hold are sealed in accordance with the law can be investigated.

I believe that after the stock exchange resumes operations, it can expand its business scope, taking advantage of the common mentality of valuing things and devaluing money, and trusting foreign exchange and despising legal currency, to simultaneously auction British pounds and US dollar public bonds in Shanghai, to enrich the chips. On the one hand, increase the number of public bonds in circulation, and encourage real estate activities, such as reducing real estate taxes, and simplifying the transfer procedures of land ownership certificates and deeds, so that the convenience of buying and selling or mortgaging land is the same as stocks and bonds. The income of the national treasury and the municipal treasury can be increased, and the destination of floating capital can also be expanded. This may also be a means of regulating finance and stabilizing the market.

### Bombay Gold and Silver Market; Speculative Activity Very Acute

[Reuters, London, 7th Dispatch] According to "The Economist" magazine, the Indian government's crackdown on speculative activities in the Bombay gold and silver market has not yet achieved significant results. According to an official of the Ministry of Finance, the purpose of raising the import tax on gold and silver is to thwart speculative activities, but the result is the opposite, because the new tax is not enough to balance the difference between the prices in the Bombay and international markets, but rather makes the difference more significant. The price of gold in Bombay is 99 rupees per ounce, equivalent to 394 shillings per ounce, which is 129% higher than the price in London. According to Indian government regulations, the import tax on gold is 25 rupees per tola (equivalent to 180 grains of pure gold), and the import tax on silver is increased by 8 annas per ounce.

### There is Talk of Continued Gold Arrivals

In order to stabilize gold prices, the government authorities are selling unlimited amounts of gold daily through the Central Bank, and the amount has reached 4,000 bars. It is said that they will continue to sell in the future, and a large amount of gold will be shipped from abroad to this port.

### Appeal from Seventeen Schools in Distress; Hope for a Solution Before the Summer Vacation

— Our Reporter: Mu Ren

The War of Resistance has been won, and everything is brewing for reconstruction. However, looking at the results of reconstruction in the past six months, there does not seem to be much progress to report, especially in educational reconstruction.

Education is the foundation of a country. At this time when everything after the war is waiting to be rebuilt, we should cultivate talent for national construction more. However, seeing the widespread loss of education for young people and the school panic all over the country makes us doubt the government's repeated claims of how much it values education.

Yesterday afternoon, at a reception for journalists hosted by the Shanghai Private Schools Association for Schools in Distress, Chairman Sun Xiangzhong, on behalf of schools such as the Patriotic Girls' School, Chongde Girls' Middle School, Xinhua Art Teachers' School, Southeast Women's Physical Education Teachers' School, Mingde Girls' Middle School, Qingxin Girls' Middle School, Guangdong Girls' Middle School, Chengzhong Middle School, McLaren Middle School, Nianhua Girls' Middle School, Qingxin Middle School, Junxiu Girls' School, Boren Middle School, Yuyu Middle School, Xinmin Middle School, and universities such as Datong University and Chizhi College, stretched their necks, raised their voices, and cried out loudly to government authorities and people from all walks of life.

Chairman Sun said: "Our schools have been either completely destroyed or partially damaged in this war. School equipment has been lost and the losses are huge. During this period of post-war reconstruction, recovery is not easy. If fortunately some or all of the buildings are preserved, they are mostly occupied by the military. Although we have repeatedly appealed in joint names to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Education, the Envoy of Comfort, the Senate, the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, and the Bureau for the Disposal of Enemy and Puppet Property, requesting the allocation of enemy property buildings and repair expenses of 10,000 yuan per school, so far there has been no result. They either say that they have submitted a request to the supervisory authority for approval, or say that it 'must be handled by the central or local government in a unified manner.' They push each other around and no one takes responsibility. It has been half a year since the victory, and another semester is coming to an end. Many of our schools are either still suspended or struggling with makeshift facilities. We feel that we can no longer delay like this. On April 6, we sent a special express telegram to Chairman Chiang, requesting that he order the Shanghai Municipal Government to allocate enemy property buildings and repair funds."

"For the sake of national education and the future of the nation, we hope that the government authorities can provide assistance and find a solution before the summer vacation." Chairman Sun concluded his speech in this impassioned manner.

Deputy Director Li Ximou of the Municipal Education Bureau stood up to speak amidst applause. He recounted the difficulties of the Education Bureau's situation. After the victory, the Education Bureau was unable to fully exercise its power to receive enemy and puppet schools. For example, when receiving puppet schools, it only received a group of students. Therefore, a few days ago, it proposed to the Municipal Provisional Council that all military units should vacate the schools they occupied.

Deputy Director Li also said: Recently, the Third War Area Army and the Japanese Residents Management Office intend to transfer enemy and puppet properties to the municipal government for disposal. Mayor Qian has verbally agreed that if the municipal government has the power to dispose of these houses, it will first allocate them to schools, and then to government offices and municipal government staff dormitories.

On the one hand, Deputy Director Li also suggested that the schools in distress should prepare a list of losses and submit it to the government, so that they can be used to clear and claim old debts from Japan in the future. "The Education Bureau is very concerned about this matter and will do its best to help, but its power is weak. I hope everyone can understand this effort." Deputy Director Li said in conclusion.

Walking out of the meeting, I thought of the many students without schools to attend: "Education first! Is education really first?"

### Rice Granaries Empty! Roads Treeless! Hunan Disaster Victims Litter the Ground

— Changsha Correspondence, March 25th, Special Correspondent Gao Yuanli

The severity of the disaster in Hunan has recently garnered significant attention from all sides. According to those who have inspected the disaster areas in Hunan province, the situation seems even more dire than the Shaanxi famine of the 20s and the Henan famine of the 30s. Hunan, which has been widely recognized as China's granary in recent years, has been reduced to a state of having no food to eat, and one can imagine the gravity of the situation.

Over the past week, this reporter has been in contact with various parties and, after synthesizing their opinions, they unanimously believe that (1) due to the enemy's devastation before the victory and (2) due to the muddled disasters after the victory, southern Hunan has fallen into a predicament where there is no peace and everywhere is barren.

Unprecedented Loss of Manpower and Draft Cattle

Of course, the enemy's devastation before the victory affected more than just Hunan province. However, after the Battle of Wuhan, Hunan became the gateway to the nation. Over the past seven years, the battles, which occurred almost every time after the autumn harvest, gave the countryside no respite. Loss led to decline, and decline led to bankruptcy. According to statistics from the Hunan branch of the National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (NRRA), the province lost as many as 642,788 head of draft cattle alone. The loss of manpower, including deaths, injuries, illnesses, and those affected, totaled 2.25 million people. Among them, poor farmers accounted for the majority of deaths due to corvée labor and disease, totaling 1.5 million people. The only wealth of the countryside is manpower. Now, with 1.5 million people lost and such a huge loss of draft cattle, even the wealthiest granary cannot avoid a reduction in production. Moreover, Hunan's reputation as a surplus grain-producing area is merely a facade. In reality, farmers often exchanged coarse grains for staple grains in order to sell them for export, which was the main source of rural finance. Currently, with coarse grains in short supply, they inevitably have to rely on staple grains for their livelihood. Thus, this paper lantern collapses with a single poke, and the disastrous situation immediately becomes apparent.

Agricultural Implements and Seeds Completely Destroyed, Nothing Left

While the countryside's manpower and draft cattle have suffered such significant losses, other agricultural implements, seeds, and houses were also completely destroyed during the enemy's occupation and wartime. Consequently, the phenomenon of tenant farmers abandoning their land and fleeing the famine has surged. The tenant farmers of the Xiangxiang County Middle School's property made two demands to the school: (1) to relinquish their tenancy, (2) if they must continue farming, then please provide draft cattle, seeds, and capital; otherwise, they can only let the land lie barren. The general situation in Xiangxiang is like this. Other counties are roughly the same. Farmers on both sides of the railway in Hengshan County have left their land and come to the soup kitchens set up by the Hunan branch of the NRRA at the Dabao and Xialiugou railway stations for food. In the villages, one or two families can still be seen plowing with humans pulling the plow, and these are still considered better-off families. The desolation is even more widespread in Qiyang and Lingling. People no longer distinguish between yours and mine. Under the premise of survival, they live for as long as they can. As a result, various illegal and disruptive acts continue to occur. Qi Xiude, the magistrate of Lingling County, reported that 248 people had died of starvation, all verified with names by the baojia chiefs. Yu Jichuan, director of the Hunan branch of the NRRA, personally inspected the situation and brought back eight kinds of grass roots and bark that the people were eating. It is said that these samples have been sent to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) in New York.

The situation is equally serious in the counties of northern and central Hunan, such as Pingjiang, Liuyang, Yueyang, and Xiangyin, as well as the lakeside counties of Nanhua and Anxiang. Many of the dikes and embankments around the lakes have also been destroyed by the enemy. Many lake fields are flooded and cannot be cultivated. Farmers not only lacked cotton quilts in winter, but they did not even have a single cotton garment. Because a large number of ships were destroyed, transportation is extremely inconvenient, and the circulation of goods is a major problem.

"Muddled Disasters" Add at Least Half to the Disaster

The muddled disasters after the victory have added at least half to the disaster situation. Taking Xiangyin as an example: When the army marched north, many houses were demolished to build bridges for the sake of transportation convenience. Even the tower railings and pillars were torn down. There were also instances of digging up graves and taking unrotted coffins to build bridges. A considerable number of troops passed through Hunan, and although it was only temporary, it did cause some disturbance to the disaster-stricken countryside. Taking chickens and ducks, buying grain, some were indeed consumed by the troops themselves, while some were resold to become civilian grain and food for profit. Even though the Third War Area has been in the Shanghai-Nanjing area for half a year, there are still personnel from the Third War Area requisitioning ships in You County today, making it impossible to transport the coal produced there. The price of coal in Changsha has suddenly doubled.

Emergency Relief and Work Relief Cannot Solve the Problem

The Hunan branch of the NRRA has been established for more than half a year, and their work ethic is commendable. However, due to transportation limitations, they have only distributed 1,000 bags of old clothes and 300 bags of old shoes in terms of supplies (many of the old shoes are high-heeled leather shoes, which seem to be of no use in the countryside). Several hundred tons of flour were distributed, and some of the flour was damaged by moisture during transportation from Wuhan to Changsha. Although the number of tons of flour transported to Hunan is over 700, the actual amount received is not much, and almost all of it has been allocated to Hengyang, Qiyang, and Lingling for emergency relief and work relief.

The branch has indeed made the greatest effort in emergency relief. According to staff members, they focused almost all of their efforts on emergency relief in southern Hunan during January and February. The number of soup kitchens in Lingling was increased from one to four, and the number of people sheltered was increased from 500 to 1,000. For work relief, the planned Lingdao Highway, Lingdong Highway, and Shaoxin Highway were successively started, but the continuous rain has greatly affected progress.

Empty Gestures Farmers Don't Want

Emergency relief and work relief still cannot solve the problem. What the people need is their own land. However, the restoration of their own land requires draft cattle, agricultural implements, seeds, fertilizers, capital, and labor. Therefore, agricultural loans are the most urgent need at present. However, the agricultural loans that are actually available are completely unsuitable for the needs of the common people. The first phase of agricultural loans jointly organized by middle farmers and the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration amounted to only 120 million yuan. They were distributed to 25 counties and cities severely affected by the disaster, such as Changsha, Hengyang, Qiyang, Yueyang, Linxiang, Xiangtan, Hengshan, Changning, and Xiangxiang. The original maximum amount for each county was 8 million yuan, but because of excessive competition for loans, it was changed to at least 8 million yuan. But this amount is indeed a drop in the bucket and does not help. Although the total amount for each county is 8 million yuan, how much is actually distributed to each borrowing farmer? Assuming that there are 1,000 households requesting loans in each county, each household can only borrow 8,000 yuan. This small amount is far from enough to buy cattle (the price of cattle in Hunan is at least 200,000 yuan per head). They can buy seeds but have no agricultural implements, or they can buy agricultural implements but have no fertilizer. It's truly ridiculous! It is said that of the 8 million yuan in Hengyang, only over 1 million yuan has been loaned out to date because farmers are unwilling to accept this empty gesture.

The Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has prepared a plan for the implementation of post-war agricultural relief in Hunan province and submitted it to the headquarters for approval: (1) Regarding the proposal to purchase 100,000 head of draft cattle first, the headquarters believes that such a huge number is actually impossible to purchase and the required funds are too large. There are currently no funds available for allocation. Distribution in Hunan will be considered when the UNRRA ships draft cattle in the future. (2) Regarding the proposal to manufacture 400,000 sets of agricultural implements such as plows, harrows, and hoes, the headquarters believes that local blacksmiths may not be able to supply such a quantity. The UNRRA will supply some small agricultural implements in the future. The request should be discussed later. The numbers proposed by the branch are indeed huge, but they are indeed urgently needed in southern Hunan at present. However, there are no such huge funds available, and if nothing is done, there is no way to provide relief. The disaster-stricken people can only resign themselves to fate.

Dysentery and Malaria Claim the Lives of Ordinary People

The diseases that come with hunger are exerting tremendous pressure on the starving people. People in various places are widely infected with dysentery and malaria due to malnutrition, cold, and starvation. Qi Dexiu, the magistrate of Lingling County, stated in his official report that over 10,000 people have died due to dysentery and malaria and lack of medicine. The number of deaths is the highest in Zhicheng town and the townships of Jingzhong, Quanzhong, and Qingping under the county's jurisdiction. The number of patients is three times that of the deceased. The number of patients in Xiangxiang County is increasing daily. There is a shortage of medicinal materials in the villages of Xiangxiang (referring to traditional Chinese medicine). The prescriptions prescribed by the doctors cannot be fully purchased in the pharmacies, and the villagers do not have the ability to go to the city for diagnosis and treatment. Therefore, they can only lie in bed and let the disease develop naturally. The "Report on the Epidemic and Disaster Caused by the Enemy" compiled by the Hengyang Senate announced that thousands of people in Hengyang are dying from epidemics every day. More than 90,000 people have died from epidemics in the past three months. The common illnesses are cholera and dysentery.

Exempting Military Grain from Collection Listed as the Top Priority

Delegations requesting relief are coming to Changsha to petition one after another. Invitations to report on the disaster situation to all sectors of society are everywhere, but those who make the requests do so on their own, and those who handle the requests do so on their own. It is completely useless. The relief requesting delegations almost come from all 78 counties and cities in the province.

In the high tide of appeals for disaster relief, naturally, requesting exemption from the requisition and purchase of military grain is listed as the top priority. Mr. Chou Shuofu, the representative of Xiangyin, said with grief at a reception for the press: "Along the highways, railways, and rivers in Xiangyin, there are no trees left. They have all been cut down. At the end of the war, Xiangyin had five county governments, all of which required the people to provide supplies. Please consider, to what extent is Xiangyin suffering? During the occupation, the enemy seized 100,000 shi of husked rice. How much grain is left for the people? Now, the government wants the people of Xiangyin to requisition and purchase 165,000 shi of military grain. In order to abide by the law, the people have come up with two solutions: (1) Ask the government to send personnel to search people's homes. If there is grain, it will be sealed. (2) The people will pay money and ask the government to send personnel to purchase freely from the people at market prices. Apart from the price limit, the people are willing to pay the money that is not enough. In fact, the army has already searched every household and found no grain." Another representative said: "Xiangyin not only has no grain to sell, but the people are already eating grass. Not a single cent of agricultural loans has reached the people. We have come to the province to cry out for justice and request relief agencies to provide relief as soon as possible."

Although the representatives from the counties spoke so grievously about the issue of military grain, the deputy director of the Hunan Provincial Field and Grain Management Office, who is responsible for purchasing military grain, formally announced at a reception for news reporters the current quantity purchased and the difficult supply situation. He said: "According to the statistics in the reports from the counties, only over 70,000 shi of military grain have been collected. For the portion purchased freely at market prices, it is only over 100,000 shi (according to the total amount to be purchased, it is 1.6 million shi). Currently, the grain funds are tight, and it is impossible to continue purchasing freely at market prices. However, the amount of grain to be purchased by the counties is still large. It is extremely difficult to appeal for exemption from purchase, which has led to the fact that the troops stationed in Hengyang, Changsha, and Yueyang are about to run out of food, and the Japanese prisoners of war have been reduced to eating thin gruel or begging for food. The situation is serious and difficult to sustain." It is heard that a senior military official said when participating in a discussion on the issue of military grain purchase at the provincial government: "If military grain cannot be purchased and the army has no write [error in original text], then what am I responsible for regarding the relationship between the military and the people?"

Disasters Surround How Will the Long Years Be Passed?

On the one hand, it must be done, and on the other hand, it must be abolished. There is still no solution. Someone suggested handling it according to the Sichuan method of requisitioning from large households. Because there are indeed many large landlords in Hunan, some of whom collect 30,000 to 50,000 shi of grain every year. Letting them take out more may alleviate the current urgent need. However, the government has not formally proposed this method due to certain special relationships.

From the various situations described above, it is truly worrying to speculate on future developments. The current disaster situation can simply be said to be just emerging, or it can be said to be a warning of a great tragedy. Spring plowing is imminent, but farmers are completely unprepared. Even if spring plowing is possible, the autumn harvest is still months away. How will these long years be passed? It is truly worrying!

### The Panic of Clothing, Food, and Housing - Enveloping All of Japan

— Tokyo Dispatch, March 21st. A Joint Report from Jinbiao and Leiyun

"The people regard food as heaven." The greatest suffering in Japan is the shortage of food, which was the case during the war and even more so after the surrender. In recent years, the lack of fertilizer and the decrease in labor have created two major agricultural problems. Last year's rice crop was the worst in fourteen years. As soldiers and overseas nationals are repatriated to Japan, the situation will only worsen. Between natural disasters and man-made calamities, the people are unable to bear their fate. Last year, a certain European observer and a certain Japanese Minister of Agriculture and Forestry simultaneously issued predictions that if foreign food is not imported this year, ten million Japanese citizens will suffer from malnutrition due to hunger, and then develop diseases and die.

Since Japan started the war with the United States in 1941, it has been aware of the panic regarding supplies and began to thoroughly control food. As a result, rice could not be bought in restaurants, and vegetables, oil, and sauces were also purchased and rationed. Farmers who cultivated the land were required to supply the government with all of their harvest according to the yield and official prices. The government rationed the minimum amount of food needed to sustain human life to the people. Originally, an adult male could receive a daily ration of two and a half 合 (gō) of rice, equivalent to 330 cubic centimeters (with proportional reductions for the elderly, children, and women). This rice had to be mixed with 20% of miscellaneous grains. Initially, Tokyo citizens could still receive a fish ration every four days, but as the war situation became increasingly tense and resources became increasingly scarce, the ration was temporarily reduced by 10% last autumn, to only 297 cubic centimeters per day. The proportion of miscellaneous grains mixed in increased from 30% to 70% after the war ended. These included no fewer than twelve types of grains, such as soybeans, buckwheat, corn, sorghum, barnyard millet, and soybean cakes, which could not be boiled soft or chewed thoroughly and had to be swallowed down with difficulty. As for the rationing of side dishes, such as vegetables, fish, and oil,

Professor Dies of Malnutrition; Government Advises Citizens to Pick Mulberry Leaves as a Tea Substitute

In Tokyo alone, an average of 1.5 million women had to spend three hours queuing up to purchase food with coupons each month, but the necessary vegetable intake for Japanese citizens was about 250 grams per person per day. In September 1943, the average daily vegetable ration for Tokyo citizens was 248 grams; in September 1944, it was 92 grams; and in September 1945, it was 25 grams. After that, the rationing of side dishes ceased altogether. A family of six was only rationed two scallions for three days. A professor at a famous specialized school died of malnutrition, later diagnosed as due to too little chlorophyll and a lack of Vitamin B, which caused an outcry. The government was unable to maintain even the production and rationing of tea leaves, so it advised the people to pick mulberry leaves as a tea substitute and ordered Tokyo citizens to pick five grams of persimmon tree leaves every day to boil in soup and eat, in order to supplement the vitamins lacking in vegetables and tea leaves.

Regarding the calories generated by food in the human body, the common measure is "calories." Generally, even if a person lies still and does nothing, they still consume 1,300 calories per day to maintain life. This is equivalent to 370 grams of rice. If they do some daily activities or work, they need 2,200 calories. During the previous world panic, investigations in the Dutch East Indies showed that the minimum necessary caloric intake for human survival was 1,800 calories per day. Currently, the average food intake of Japanese citizens is 1,500 calories per day. According to a survey by the Japanese government after the end of the war, the population was 72 million (with women outnumbering men by 4 million), but the average annual rice harvest was 65 million 石 (koku), which was consistently insufficient. Last year, two major typhoons and floods destroyed iron bridges, causing the greatest damage since the founding of the national railway. Therefore, the autumn harvest was further reduced from the expected 46 million 石 (koku) to 42 million 石 (koku). The "supply" purchase volume from farmers was reduced from 30 million 石 (koku) to 26 million 石 (koku), and they were allowed to substitute it with other wheat flour, mulberry leaves, sweet potato vines, etc. However, farmers now distrust the government and are taking a wait-and-see attitude, reluctant to "supply" their crops. Therefore, the problem now is not whether there is enough to eat, but whether the farmers are willing to bring it out, because even with a poor harvest, the current level of rations can still last until this summer. In reality, there is only a shortage of food for June, July, and August. However, now, in April and May, the farmers are unwilling to trust this government and "supply" their crops. Therefore, at the end of last year, the food reserves in the six major cities nationwide were only enough for eight days in Tokyo, five days in Kyoto, and only twelve or three days in the other four major cities.

The Public Advocates "Flour-Based Diet"; Dandelions and Weeds Are Eaten as Food

After Japan surrendered, the Allied countries allowed it to import a portion of food, but it was a drop in the bucket and did not solve the problem. Therefore, fertilizer was converted into feed, and feed was used as food. For example, silkworm pupae left over after raising silkworms and producing silk, which were originally used as fertilizer before the war, were converted from fertilizer to feed during the war, then to industrial oil raw materials, and then to valuable raw materials for manufacturing nutritional medicines. Ordinary people could not easily obtain them, and nutritional medicines were only rationed to hospitals and the military. It is said that if one lives on a daily ration of two 合 (gō) of rice, the various nutrients lacking in the human body can be supplemented by eating ten silkworm pupae. Eating thirteen would be excessive. In addition to rice, wheat, sweet potatoes, and beans as the main foods, it has recently been discovered that twenty kinds of wild plants such as dandelions can be eaten. They are currently being collected, dried, and ground into flour to be mixed into bread. Therefore, a "flour-based diet" is now being promoted. Tree bark, mulberry leaves, radish roots, sweet potato vines, fish bones, weeds, locusts, etc., are easily swallowed and eaten once they are dried and made into flour. Therefore, Japan claims that the "era of the flour-based diet" has arrived.

They Only Set Fires and Didn't Kill People; Hemiplegia is Both Tragic and Comic

The Japanese themselves have said: "It is easy to burn wood with fire, but Japanese houses are made by sawing the wood into finer pieces, framing it more sparsely, and adding paint and paper to make it burn even more easily." The Allied forces saw clearly where its weaknesses lay and decided to adopt incendiary tactics. Each small six-pound incendiary bomb dropped required relatively little capital, but set extremely large fires. Furthermore, they only set fires and didn't kill people, which was both chaotic, pitiful, and hilariously funny.

Originally, the US Air Force's bombing plan for Japan was carried out in three phases: the first phase targeted military facilities and munitions factories, the second phase involved indiscriminate bombing of large, medium, and small cities, and the third phase involved the destruction of transportation infrastructure. The effect of the first phase was to reduce Japan's aircraft manufacturing capacity. When the war began in July 1937, Japan's monthly aircraft production was only 100 aircraft. By June 1945, it had gradually increased to 3,000 aircraft per month, but as a result of the US bombing of munitions factories, it suddenly decreased to 1,000 aircraft in July. Underground factories could not be rebuilt in a short time, and the air combat capability was greatly reduced. The second phase was the bombing of cities. Most of the six major cities, except Kyoto, were subjected to multiple air raids, with over 800 B-29s deployed in one night. Later, medium and small cities were not spared. A total of 100,000 tons of incendiary bombs were dropped on 66 cities across the country, destroying 42% of industrial areas. As an example, Kagoshima Prefecture, the southernmost coastal prefecture in the Pacific theater, was attacked 168 times in the 150 days from the start of the bombing until the surrender. All but five villages and cities out of the prefecture's three cities and 138 villages were attacked, showing the extent of the damage. The third phase of bombing had just begun when Japan surrendered. Presumably, the Pacific War would have followed the example of Germany, bombing the country until not a single inch of railway was passable, cutting off supplies, and making it impossible to fight before launching a landing invasion. Therefore, they initially only bombed railway bridges. At that time, the entrance to the underwater tunnel connecting Kyushu and Shimonoseki had been bombed to the point of being irreparable, and the first-line transportation had already become hemiplegic. Later, even the city streetcars were bombed, and sea mines were used for maritime blockade, sinking 500,000 tons of ships, and the supply of goods was almost completely cut off.

The Total Number of Houses Destroyed in Japan Reaches 2.1 Million Households

In terms of housing, most Japanese houses are wooden due to frequent severe earthquakes. Typhoons and floods occur frequently, and the devastation of collapses and washouts has become the greatest concern in recent years, making it impossible to live and work in peace. They could not withstand the US Air Force's incendiary bomb tactics. When a fire started, it spread for miles, and a city would be finished after just a few bombings. This time, 2.1 million homes were destroyed nationwide. After Japan surrendered, citizens returned home from evacuation in the countryside, but due to problems with timber and transportation, they could not be rebuilt and restored in a short time. Therefore, they are now living in groups in temples and schools.

Houses Were Demolished Automatically; Housing Panic Worsened

On the afternoon of June 18, 1944, when the reporter got off the streetcar in front of the Mitsukoshi Department Store in Nihonbashi, the busiest district in Tokyo, he saw a large group of people rushing to buy extra editions of the newspaper. He went up to take a look and learned that it was about the first US air raid on the iron and steel plant in northern Kyushu. The area within 20 里 (li) of Yawata was full of chimneys, smoke, small iron rails, and coal. It was indeed a wartime stronghold. Therefore, the people in Japan experienced a great psychological shock, and from then on, they intensified air defense training day and night, working tirelessly on firefighting, rescue, and evacuation. Until November 24, 1944, when groups of B-29 giant aircraft flew slowly over the heads of Tokyo citizens, everyone realized that air raids could not be defended by human power, so they demolished their houses and evacuated to the countryside, or dug holes in the rubble of the burnt ruins and hid their clothes, quilts, pots, and bowls inside, living a trench life. When going out on the street, people had to wear air defense clothing, steel helmets, leggings, and first-aid kits, and would be interfered with by the police if they were missing anything. At the same time, Japan strictly controlled the people's thoughts, and the censorship of correspondence was very strict. Therefore, people would only understand how terrible the air raids were when they happened to them. Every time a place was bombed, a pre-printed notice was immediately posted on every mailbox, warning citizens that correspondence, in addition to their own safety, was prohibited from informing relatives and friends of the details of the bombing, otherwise they would be severely punished.

Even with "Clothing Coupons," Clothing Could Still Not Be Bought

Japan was originally the world's leading textile country, but its raw materials were all supplied by others. During the war, the raw cotton from India and the wool from Australia were cut off, and there were problems with the shortage of chemical fibers and rayon due to the lack of medicine production. The only thing to rely on was silk. However, due to the increase in food production, the area of mulberry trees was reduced from 500,000 町 (chō) to 200,000 町 (chō), and silk factories were also incorporated into the fourth level of industry because their machinery was transferred to munitions manufacturing. At the same time, silk products had to be given priority for parachutes and aircraft manufacturing and could not be used entirely for civilian needs. Therefore, the raw materials for fiber were certainly controlled and purchased, and textile products were also manufactured comprehensively, and the people's clothing supplies were undoubtedly subject to strict rationing. In the last two years, each adult male was rationed 50 "clothing points." When buying fiber products on the market, in addition to the price, a certain number of these "clothing points" had to be paid. For example, a pair of socks required about three points, a undershirt required about ten points, and a set of shorts and trousers required 40 points. Once these "clothing points" were used up, it was impossible to buy cloth again. But soon things got worse. Even with money and "clothing points," it was still impossible to buy clothing. Families had to have a 保甲 (bao-jia) "ration ticket," workers had to have a factory "ration ticket," and students had to have a school "ration ticket." Later, there was simply no clothing in the stores, and the allocation of black scraps of cloth for repairing umbrellas and the allocation of cotton thread for mending clothes were repeatedly delayed, leading from disappointment to despair. Therefore, paper substitutes such as paper hats, paper vests, and paper sheets came into being.

Ridiculously and pitifully, Japanese farmers harvested the green ears of rice and wheat crops before they were fully ripe. This was because once they ripened and the stalks turned yellow, they were afraid that they would be burned by phosphorus and sulfur bombs dropped by US aircraft. Also, because of the lack of oil fields and the disruption of supplies from the South Seas, resources were extremely scarce, so they tried to refine alcohol from sweet potato starch for use in aircraft and fuel. Therefore, at a time when food was scarce, they dug up rice fields to plant sweet potatoes, appealing to the people: "People have to eat, and airplanes have to eat too!" Therefore, even sweet potatoes became difficult to obtain for food as they were used for industrial purposes during the war. After painstaking research by various universities, more than 20 new varieties of sweet potatoes were invented, the best of which contained 24% starch. Seedlings were regularly rationed to households, and everyone had to plant and "supply" them. When houses were burned down in air raids, people were encouraged to plant sweet potatoes on the burned land, because the burned land contained potassium fertilizer, which was most suitable for planting sweet potatoes. At the same time, many of the dropped incendiary bomb shells were converted into agricultural tools. Even if there were more bombings after planting, the sweet potatoes, being underground root crops, would not be damaged. Once the surrender came, just in time for the harvest, they shifted the military use to civilian food and used the air-raid shelters as storage for the harvested goods.

Allied Forces Confiscate Military Clothing and Rice; Convert to Use by Japanese Civilians

At the same time, in the past three months, the US Sixth Army has confiscated 200,000 tons of military food and 200,000 pieces of clothing from the Japanese army and navy. These confiscated items have all been converted for use by Japanese civilians.

These materials include 132,000 tons of soybeans, 42,000 tons of fish and meat, and 113.3 million cans of canned vegetables. In addition, a large number of clothes have been distributed, including 4.5 million blankets, 4 million pairs of shoes, 4 million pairs of socks, 600,000 coats, 3 million sets of uniforms, and 4 million sets of underwear.

According to figures announced yesterday by the 11th Corps of the Eighth Army, this second list of declarations includes at least 46,000 tons of food, approximately 3 million blankets, 2 million upper garments and coats, 3 million other items of clothing, 1.5 million pairs of shoes, and some building materials and medicines urgently needed by the Japanese people.

### Japanese Prisoners of War Serve in Beijing

Under the auspices of the Nanjing Municipal Bureau of Public Works, the service projects of Japanese unarmed officers and soldiers are undertaken by the Japanese 40th Division, divided into five work teams, totaling 12,000 people. One of the most difficult sections of the entire project is the dredging of the Qinhuai River. Due to years of siltation, the water level is high, and after several days of heavy rain, it is almost higher than the ground in Beijing and outside the city. The riverbed has 30,000 cubic meters of mud accumulation. There are 2,770 cubic meters of garbage on the shore. To lower the water level, it is necessary to remove the mud accumulation and garbage.

Special Issue on Production and Construction

### Advocating the Knitting Industry

— Zhou Keqiang

The knitting industry has been recorded as early as the thirteenth century in Italy and was introduced to England in the mid-fifteenth century. At that time, knitting machinery was simple and the products were rough, only hand-knitted. But because its fabrics are necessary for daily life, it was noticed by the world in the sixteenth century. At the end of the sixteenth century, William Lee, an Englishman, invented the hand-operated stocking machine with elastic needles. This great achievement laid the foundation for the knitting industry and aroused the interest of the world in studying knitting. Later, Matthew Townshend, an Englishman, invented the latch needle, and the action of the latch needle in weaving fabrics is simpler than that of the elastic needle. At this point, it promoted the fundamental reform of the knitting machine and allowed the scope of hand weaving to enter mechanization, and the knitting industry also showed a bright future. It is said above that knitted fabrics are necessary for daily life. Why are they necessary for daily life? Because knitted fabrics have their unique properties and uses: the weaving of knitted fabrics is formed by bending yarn lines and connecting them according to the direction of the warp and weft. Therefore, when the fabric is subjected to strong force, it tightens and becomes a straight line, and when the external force is removed, it returns to its original shape. The Japanese named the knitting machine "Mosaku Daijyo" (something like large, small machine) because its fabric is highly elastic. Also, because the fabric is connected by yarn lines into crooked and small curves, the structure has many holes, so the finished product is soft and loose, suitable for making underwear, gloves, socks, etc., which can absorb sweat in summer and keep warm in winter, fit the body, and give a pleasant feeling, and are clothing materials that stick to the skin. Since the eight-year war of resistance, the general public has long been ragged and tattered. If we rely on other countries to give us some rags and pants, it may not be a fundamental solution, because our country has a vast territory and a large population. If these 450 million compatriots each add a piece of clothing and pants, the total number would be alarming. Moreover, after the victory, the Japanese lost the markets for knitted fabrics in Southeast Asia, and left many knitting machines in our country. We should seize this opportunity to develop this once-in-a-lifetime good opportunity for foreign trade. Have you not seen that others are fighting each other to win the market? If we miss this good opportunity and do not seek progress, it will prove that we are doing nothing and waiting for others to invade. However, we have to say that there are certainly difficulties for us to revitalize the knitting industry. Our country has a short history of knitting and immature technology, so we must make the greatest efforts and request the government to operate with national capital, cultivate knitting technical talents, and recruit more talents to make them work with peace of mind and give full play to their abilities.

The author once visited the Shandai Weaving Factory in Nanlinli, Xizang Road. It is an enemy property and was taken over and resumed operation by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. It is a small factory with complete machinery. The managers Zhu Xun, Wang Heling and nearly a hundred employees. Upon entering the factory, everything was clean and tidy. Eye-catching slogans were often guided into the workshop. The workers had no sound of talking and teasing, and only saw them focusing on their work without slackening. Therefore, on the finished product statistics table, the line of work efficiency went white. According to the workers, a meeting is held at the beginning of each week, where the employees take turns reporting current affairs news, the work that should be done this week, and talk about a passage on the fate of China. At the end of the week, each department holds a small group discussion to review the shortcomings of the work during the week and the matters that should be improved. All management can be said to be in good order. Therefore, it is very worthwhile for us to advocate the knitting industry. We hope that the government will resume the operation and takeover of various knitting factories as soon as possible, widely recruit and cultivate knitting talents, pay attention to worker education, so that the knitting industry can occupy an important position in our country's construction and enrichment.

### Aviation Industry

— Han

The most fashionable industry of the twentieth century can be said to be the aviation industry; due to the development of aircraft, the distance of space is greatly shortened. The losses caused by time in the past are now reduced, and the difficulties felt by terrain in the past are now resolved.

Aviation has cast a glorious and indelible page in the history of victory in this great war. Whether on the battlefield or in the rear, it has shown excellent results. Today, with the arrival of peace, it will take on the responsibility of transportation, communication of culture, dissemination of the seeds of peace, and increasing human happiness. In terms of national defense and people's livelihood, it is a necessary condition for a modern country.

### The Tea Industry Before and After Victory

— Ba Ling

Tea has always been one of our country's major exports. According to statistics from the tea industry, tea exports before the Anti-Japanese War were around 600,000 metric tons annually, recovering a considerable amount of lost wealth.

With the outbreak of the "August 13th" Incident, tea exports suffered a severe blow. Especially after the outbreak of the Pacific War, the sales channels for tea completely collapsed. General tea factories closed down one after another, and tea workers either switched to small-scale trading, traveled around making a precarious living, or, lacking business acumen and unable to travel, fell into poverty and starvation. This was truly the most depressed period for the tea industry.

After the victory, various industries resumed operations, and tea, as one of our country's major export commodities, naturally actively prepared for recovery. However, on the one hand, due to soaring prices and financial difficulties for tea merchants, only a dozen or so were able to restore their former businesses. On the other hand, during the Anti-Japanese War, mountain farmers dug up tea plants to grow food, resulting in tea production only reaching two-tenths of pre-war levels. Restoring pre-war production levels is simply not something that can be achieved in a short period of time.

According to a person in the tea industry speaking to the writer: Before the war, the most famous exported teas were Keemun black tea, Wuyuan Chunmee, Pingshui, Dapeng pearl tea, as well as Hangzhou's Longjing and Shifeng teas. Taking Shanghai as an example, there were more than sixty tea factories. Each factory employed more than ten workers. The workers' wages, in addition to providing food and lodging, were about seven jiao (old currency) of silver dollars per day. Now, with the cost of living rising daily, workers' wages, in addition to food and lodging, must be at least around 1,000 legal tender. However, with this small amount, maintaining the family life of each worker is also not an easy task.

Currently, in order to develop the foreign trade of the tea industry, the industry hopes that the government authorities, in addition to the National Bank providing tea loans (this step has already been taken), will assist in the following items:

(1) Since 1941, tea exports have been interrupted, tea merchants have suffered a setback, and tea farmers have become even more impoverished, leading to a sharp decline in production. It is hoped that the government will provide relief quickly.

(2) Tea is one of the major export commodities. In the past, due to tea merchants adhering to outdated methods and failing to make improvements, and the government not having time to attend to this, tea exports gradually declined from the second position. In the future, both government and industry should cooperate to improve production and seek revitalization.

In addition, strengthening the organization of the Tea Trade Association, promoting solidarity and cooperation among industry members, and avoiding shoddy products are also several things that the tea industry should pay attention to after victory.

### The Work of Thinking

— Wang Ying

In the management of a business, the work of thinking is very important, because everything must be carefully considered before being implemented.

To think comprehensively, the first thing is to understand thoroughly. To understand thoroughly, one must first engage in self-cultivation, study all the knowledge required in management, and then combine it with experience. This can make the work of thinking more complete, and even if the issues resolved are not absolutely free of errors, at least many unnecessary errors can be avoided.
