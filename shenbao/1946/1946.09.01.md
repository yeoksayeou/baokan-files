### Negotiations on Reorganizing the National Government Committee: Wu and Zhang Have Received Instructions; Chairman Advocates Expanding the Government Base

[Special dispatch from this newspaper, Kuling, July 31st] Special Envoy Marshall and his wife visited the Chairman's office at 10:30 AM on the 31st. After a half-hour conversation, they were accompanied by the Chairman's wife to visit the Kuling Library. It is rumored that Special Envoy Marshall will return to Nanjing in a day or two, and some of his belongings have already been transported down the mountain.

[Central News Agency dispatch from Kuling, July 31st] Wu Tiecheng and Zhang Lisheng went to the Chairman's office together at 9:30 AM on the morning of the 31st to receive instructions before participating in the five-person talks. The Chairman strongly advocated the speedy realization of expanding the government base. They left after an hour and then attended a joint meeting of the Central Affairs Supervisory Committee of the Youth League. In the afternoon, they visited Dai Chuanxian, Zhou Zhongyue, Luo Luying, and others to discuss the matter. They are scheduled to return to Nanjing on the 2nd.

[Central News Agency dispatch from Kuling, July 31st] According to authoritative sources, the government representatives participating in the five-person talks have received instructions to negotiate with the Communist Party on the reorganization of the National Government Committee with sincerity and a peaceful attitude, so that one of the five major proposals of the Political Consultative Conference can be thoroughly studied and a perfect implementation method can be obtained.

[Special dispatch from this newspaper, Nanjing, July 31st] After Ambassador Stuart's flight from Nanjing to Shanghai at 8:00 AM on the 31st, political activities in the capital became even more silent. The general public is currently expecting Wu Tiecheng and Zhang Lisheng to return to Nanjing so that the informal five-person meeting, which holds the key to peace, can be convened as soon as possible. On the Communist Party side, Zhou Enlai had no activities on the 31st, presumably preparing for the meeting. This reporter recently asked a foreign authoritative figure about the possible effects of the talks. He said: Judging from Zhou Enlai's attitude, just as the government hopes, he is also striving to achieve ideal results in this meeting, smoothly completing the reorganization of the National Government Committee, so as to further achieve the goal of reorganizing the government. However, the Communist Party delegation's spokesman's insistence on two preconditions is actually extremist propaganda. It is expected that after the official start of the meeting, it will gradually become clear.

### US Ambassador Arrives in Shanghai from Nanjing: Claims No Special Mission This Time; Hopes to Promote China's Democratic Politics Together

[Report from this newspaper] US Ambassador to China, Dr. Stuart, arrived in Shanghai by special plane at 10:20 AM yesterday, his first visit since taking office. US Embassy Army Attaché Barr and Naval Attaché Kaine, along with Lu Qixin, Chief Secretary of the Central Propaganda Department, arrived together. Those who went to Jiangwan Airport to welcome him included US Consul General in Shanghai Davis, Army Attaché Eden, and representatives of the Chamber of Commerce. On the Chinese side were Zhang Bide, a representative of Wu Chang, Gao Lingbai, a representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and several alumni of Yenching University. The ambassador, wearing a navy blue suit and a felt hat, was all smiles and was immediately surrounded by well-wishers after disembarking. Some Yenching University alumni brought three children, who also stepped forward to shake hands with the ambassador. The ambassador leaned down to comfort them, repeatedly asking "How are you?" and then went to the US Consulate with Davis in the same car.

American Community Hosts Banquet

At 12:30 PM, seventeen directors of the American Chamber of Commerce held a banquet to welcome the ambassador on the fifth floor of the American Club on Fuzhou Road. The ambassador changed into a white suit and arrived on time accompanied by Davis. Before entering the elevator, he posed for a photo at the request of this newspaper's reporter. The ambassador delivered an impromptu speech at the banquet, first saying: "I myself was more surprised than anyone else to be appointed as ambassador. I can only guarantee that I will first try my best to learn and then faithfully fulfill my duties. Currently, the main activity is naturally to strive to assist General Marshall's peace negotiations." Next, he said: "What the US government and people need for China is exactly what the Chinese people hope for, namely, national freedom and independence, domestic unity and peace, and the development of economic progress and construction. The only question now is how to achieve these clear goals." Finally, he said: "Although most of my personal efforts are currently focused on solving the Chinese peace issue, I will still do my best to protect the interests of American citizens here and throughout China."

Reception for Reporters

At 2:30 PM, the US Information Office in the Hamilton Building was crowded with Chinese and foreign reporters. Those who arrived later had no seats and stood listening. The ambassador gave a brief speech and personally translated it into fluent and accurate Mandarin, roughly saying: "I have no news to offer on this trip to Shanghai, but because I deeply feel that newspapers are extremely powerful in promoting democratic politics, I am happy to meet with you all today. The establishment of a democratic system in China is the wish of the people of the whole country, and the government is also prepared to implement it. A democratic system is the best political system in the world, but it requires people to have considerable knowledge and know how to love their country. Otherwise, democracy will be an empty slogan. I have been in charge of Yenching University affairs for many years, founded the journalism department, and cultivated talents. I feel even more that at the beginning of the implementation of democratic politics, newspapers have a major mission. I hope to cooperate with you in the future to promote China's democratic politics." After the ambassador finished speaking, reporters raised three questions about the five-person group meeting, China's current economic situation, and the mission of the US military in North China. The ambassador predicted the future of the KMT-CPC negotiations, saying: "I hope there will be a satisfactory solution. The five-person group meeting is the first step to break the deadlock. Negotiations will begin this Monday." As for the current economic situation in China, he said that because he is not an economic expert, he cannot make a hasty conclusion, but the situation is indeed very bad. Finally, he said: "The purpose of the US Marine Corps' stay in North China is to repatriate Japanese nationals and temporarily protect the railway." The ambassador especially emphasized the word "temporary" because the interpreter did not translate the word "temporary," so the ambassador immediately repeated it and corrected it. This reception lasted only 20 minutes. At 6:00 PM, the American Association held a cocktail party at the Country Club to welcome the ambassador. The traffic on Columbia Road was heavy, and the scene was extremely grand.

Today (the 1st), Mayor Wu and his wife will host a banquet, and General Gillem will host a reception in the evening. The ambassador is scheduled to return to Nanjing on the 2nd.

### Army Authorities Decide to Establish Three Training Schools

US Advisory Group Responsible for Guidance

[Special dispatch from this newspaper, Nanjing, July 31st] In order to facilitate the training of the National Army, the Army authorities have decided to cooperate with the US Military Advisory Group to establish three training schools for infantry, field artillery, and armored units from October this year, training a large number of assistant instructors. The training in the above three schools is of a short-term nature, with each training session accommodating 100 people for a period of two months. The trainees are officers at the rank of captain and lieutenant, selected from outstanding personnel from various units.

### National Army Concentrating in Chengde One After Another; Communist Army at Gubeikou Shaken; Tensions Simmering in the Eastern Front of Northern Jiangsu

[Special dispatch from this newspaper, Shenyang, July 30th] Now that Chengde has been taken by the National Army, subsequent troops have been concentrating in Chengde one after another, and the Communist Army in Rehe Province is in a state of chaos. It is reported that the National Army is currently working hard to maintain railway transportation between Chengde and Gubeikou. The Communist Army at Gubeikou shows signs of wavering and is currently evacuating supplies.

[Central News Agency dispatch from Beiping, July 30th] Military news indicates that the Communist Army unit of Li Yunchang in Rehe has gradually expanded along the Beining Railway line since the middle of this month, attempting to destroy the railway and seize important strongholds along the line in order to cut off the connection between the National Army inside and outside the pass. The National Army stationed between Shanhaiguan and Jinzhou, in order to ensure the safety of the Beining Railway and to eliminate the current threat from the Communist Army, was forced to launch a counterattack on the 24th, breaking through the strong resistance of the Communist Army along the way. On the 29th, the National Army on the southern route crossed the line from Yongping Qinglongtang Dahe to the south of Pingquan Heishan Ravine. On the northern route, after recovering Chengde on the 29th, part of the force has crossed Luanping and is only 70 kilometers away from the National Army stationed in the Shixia Town area of Miyun. It is expected that they will soon join forces. Another unit of the National Army is heading north from Chengde towards Longhua and is currently sweeping towards the Wenchang area.

[United Press dispatch from Tianjin, July 31st] The Communist Army is destroying the railway between Chengde and Gubeikou in order to cover their retreat.

[Special dispatch from this newspaper, Tianjin, July 31st] After the fall of Huoxian in the southern section of the Datong-Puzhou Railway, the National Army has automatically withdrawn from Lingshi. Fierce fighting continues in the Pingyao area, and the Communist Army has the momentum to continue advancing north, launching a pincer attack on Taiyuan from the north and south.

[United Press dispatch from Beiping, July 31st] Today, authoritative sources in military circles here said: Since the National Army occupied Chengde, the Communist Party has intensified its attack on Datong. Shells have fallen in the center of Datong, causing many civilian casualties.

[Special dispatch from this newspaper, Tianjin, July 31st] A unit of the Communist Army suddenly infiltrated Xigangtou in Shijiazhuang at 1:00 AM on the 30th. After a fierce street fight with the defending troops, they were finally driven out by the Shimen militia and retreated southwest.

[Special dispatch from this newspaper, Zhenjiang, July 31st] According to a telegram from Jiangdu: The Communist Army is attacking Daxiao Baimi Town very urgently. According to reports, the situation in the town was unclear on the 30th.

[Special dispatch from this newspaper, Jiangdu, July 31st] According to a telegram from Taixian, the Communist Army attacked Masu east of Jiangyan with two regiments yesterday. The National Army, with only one company defending the area, bravely resisted and defeated the Communist Army. In addition, small groups of the Communist Army are harassing the southwest of Shaobo Lake quite fiercely. The National Army has dispatched troops to suppress them. The front line of Yangzhou is calm. It is also learned that a military conference was held in Changzhou today to discuss the new actions of the Communist Army in northern Jiangsu.

[Special dispatch from this newspaper, Taixian, July 30th] There are no major changes in the eastern front. Both sides are frequently mobilizing troops, and tensions are simmering amid the calm. It is rumored that Hujiaji, west of Haian, has fallen into the hands of the Communist Army. The Communist Army has carried out large-scale massacres in Qutang and Baimi, stabbing all government officials to death with bayonets. The total number of victims is over a thousand, and the entire Qubai area is currently shrouded in red terror. In addition, according to reliable sources, a powerful unit of the National Army will arrive here to deal with this serious situation.

### Secret Communist Documents Found on a Captured Soldier; Instructs on Land Revolution and Operational Strategies

[Central News Agency dispatch from Beiping, July 29th] Recently, the National Army found an important secret document on a captured Communist soldier in a certain area. It is a resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, instructing on future land revolution and comprehensive operational strategies. It is very clear. The full text is as follows:

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has recently stipulated a general outline of current work in the liberated areas to adapt to the situation of the domestic war that is beginning.

(1) The Question of Consolidating Liberated Areas

(1) In order to enable the liberated areas to develop forward in a consolidated manner, the land revolution must be deepened and expanded, and the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army must have good unity, solid organization, and political determination. Especially at the beginning of the revolutionary war, it is necessary to be able to conduct large-scale positional warfare, to be able to defeat the Kuomintang's offensive, and to be able to concentrate the scattered liberated regimes and establish a national liberated regime. This requires striving for the following three most important conditions:

(1) Complete the full mobilization of the peasant masses to a sufficient degree.

(2) Vigorously implement the training of reserve armed forces in regular warfare.

(3) And further acquire cities with strategic significance on points and lines.

(2) In accordance with the above conditions, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China now determines that the Jin-Ji-Cha region, connected to the Yu-Lu-Su-Bei region, is a large region. To consolidate it and develop it into the central base of the liberated areas, we must use great strength and speed to establish it firmly.

(3) The general conditions for consolidating the base areas of the liberated areas are, first, to mobilize the basic masses in the rural areas, the poor peasants, hired laborers, and coolies, to gradually obtain the benefits of the land revolution, and to consolidate the alliance with the middle peasants, and firmly oppose and suppress the development of the rich peasants. The most important strategy in this regard is to thoroughly redistribute land based on population and labor force as the standard, and strictly prohibit the rich peasants from expanding land based on production tools as the standard. We must be very cautious not to infringe upon the interests of the middle peasants. In the current liberated areas, there are still obstacles on the path of the rich peasants, taking advantage of the opportunity of equal distribution of land to seize the benefits of the land revolution. On the other hand, in many areas, there are errors in the wrong strategies of killing rich peasants and shaking middle peasants. These are the most important dangers hindering the consolidation of the liberated areas. First, it is necessary to resolutely and quickly eliminate the organizations of all reactionary forces in the liberated areas and their armed forces. It is necessary to exclude the rich peasant elements from the political power and all armed organizations. It is necessary to attract the masses of bandits and vagrants, so that they can obtain the benefits of the land revolution. The best way is to dissolve their inherent organizations, allocate them with corresponding land, and resolve their reactionary leaders. Even the leaders who sympathize with the revolution cannot be allowed to lead the original masses. Second, it is necessary to establish a truly broad liberated area regime managed by the workers, peasants, and laborers themselves. In places where the liberated area regime has been established, it is necessary to mobilize the masses to implement re-elections. The most important thing in the political power is to establish strong proletarian leadership and resolutely implement all the laws and regulations promulgated by the border area government. Third, it is necessary to establish a "iron army" of pure worker-peasant composition in the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, and at the same time, it is necessary to strengthen the training of the reserve army. Here, centralized and unified military command becomes a prerequisite. Fourth, in carrying out the task of consolidating the liberated areas, it is necessary to oppose "isolationism," "peaceful conservatism," and "evading the mountains," etc. It is necessary to oppose the suicidal policy of "cutting off territory and defending oneself" and not developing outward. In particular, it is necessary to oppose "circling" and "guerrilla" development.

(4) In the sense of consolidating the liberated areas, all cities within the liberated areas should be completely occupied. Of course, in tactics, especially in mobilizing the masses, some larger cities may not be occupied all at once, but the Kuomintang must not be allowed to continue to rule in some important cities in the Jin-Ji-Cha-Yu-Lu liberated areas, and to direct reactionary armed forces to attack the liberated areas. For example, the main reason why Suiyuan-Baotou, Datong on the Ping-Sui Railway, Pingding-Baoding, Shijiazhuang on the Ping-Han Railway, Cangzhou-Jinan, Taian, Xuzhou on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, and Tangshan-Yuhuan on the Beining Railway have been occupied by the Kuomintang for a long time is that the entire transportation artery has not been cut off by us, so the Kuomintang can transport weapons and equipment and drive straight in. This makes the interior of the liberated areas constantly at risk of being harassed by them, and we have no rear to defend when we go out to fight. However, occupying and consolidating all the cities inside the liberated areas is by no means effective by simply attacking and defending this city. On the contrary, occupying this city, if it is necessary to rely on mobilizing the broad masses of peasants around to besiege it, and to rely on intensifying the work in the city to respond to it, then consolidating this city will depend more on promoting the mobilization of the masses around it, intensifying the self-defense work of the masses in the city and countryside, and the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, which defend the democratic regime, must develop outward, cutting off all transportation of the Kuomintang, and coercing them so that they cannot invade the liberated areas. Only in this way can the liberated areas be consolidated. In summary, the interior of the liberated areas must not allow the existence of the Kuomintang's forces at all, even large cities with political significance such as Ping, Tianjin, Baoding, Shijiazhuang, and Jinan cannot be allowed to continue to exist. We must resolutely and systematically use the power of mobilizing the masses and combine it with military action to completely defeat the Kuomintang forces within the liberated areas. Of course, this does not mean that the Kuomintang's forces will never invade again, but this consolidation is a prerequisite that must be possessed at the beginning of the domestic revolutionary war.

(2) Strategy and Tactics of the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army

(1) At present, the operational strategy of the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army must be based on the national political situation and the Party's political guidelines in the liberated areas. Now the Kuomintang is taking advantage of the ceasefire to prepare for a large-scale civil war, so it can transfer several divisions of troops from South China to attack the liberated areas. Therefore, the recent strengthening of the Kuomintang army in the five provinces of Jin-Ji-Cha-Yu-Lu to attack the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army does have a considerable possibility of realization. Here, we must clearly recognize that in order to defeat the Kuomintang's offensive, in order to prevent the liberated areas from being destroyed by them, and to develop forward in a consolidated manner, we can only resolutely and quickly carry out the plan to defend the liberated areas from both inside and outside. The Party should mobilize the masses outside the liberated areas to defend the liberated areas and destroy the Kuomintang army's attempt to attack, which will not be discussed here. But within the liberated areas, it is necessary to thoroughly eliminate all armed forces of the Kuomintang and mobilize the masses for self-defense, so that the Kuomintang will not dare to send troops deep into the liberated areas in the first place. The operational strategy of the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army must adopt an offensive posture to suppress the Kuomintang's invasion. From this point of view, we should first attack the cities on the points and lines with an offensive posture, coercing the Kuomintang army to retreat to areas that do not hinder the development of the liberated areas. In this way, the liberated areas can not only be consolidated, but also developed outward, and only in this way can the consolidation of the liberated areas be guaranteed, and the Kuomintang's offensive plan can encounter a major failure. This is the general guideline for dealing with the current Kuomintang offensive, but two points must be added: (The following text continues on the second page)

### Sale of Civilian Surplus Goods: China and the United States Sign Agreement Yesterday; President Song and Mr. MacBride Issue Statement

[Central News Agency dispatch from this city] Premier Song of the Executive Yuan and Mr. MacBride, Director of the US Foreign Liquidation Commission and Special Assistant to the Secretary of State, jointly announced yesterday the signing of a general agreement between the United States and the Chinese government for the sale of a large number of civilian surplus goods in the Western Pacific and China. This sale is used to offset the cost of national currency owed by the United States in China and other appropriations equivalent to US$55 million.

### US Uses Surplus Goods to Offset Expenses in China

The original cost to the US government of these surplus goods was US$500 million, scattered among China, Okinawa, Guam, Saipan, and other islands as mobile goods, and US$85 million in fixed equipment within China. In addition, another US$130 million in surplus goods can be used to offset the US$74 million owed by the United States. There are also smaller ships costing US$90 million and surplus goods stored in the western part of the country costing US$20 million.

In order to quickly complete the repairs and shipment of these goods, both parties agreed to establish a reserve of US$30 million specifically for chartering, paying technicians, and purchasing parts. This reserve will also be offset under the national currency owed by the United States. The reason for the United States government's arrears is the expense of the American motorcade in the Shanxi during the United States' war against Japan.

In addition to the aforementioned arrears, the United States government obtained a value equivalent to US$35 million due to the establishment of consulates in China and other national currency expenses. To promote educational and cultural exchanges between China and the United States, China plans to spend national currency equivalent to US$20 million, which will also be offset under this surplus goods project.

### Helping Our Economic Recovery; Developing Trade Between the Two Countries

The surplus goods obtained by China are very suitable for economic recovery, so they will have a great impact on resisting the progress of inflation. Because this type of goods is in great demand in the market, its sale will provide a huge subsidy to the national treasury. However, these goods do not include aircraft, munitions, weapons, or any military supplies that have not been converted for civilian use.

On the US side, due to the conclusion of this agreement, the demobilization of the military and the liquidation of goods in the Pacific region will be accelerated. Moreover, after the Chinese market obtains these goods, it will be able to increase its strength to develop trade between China and the United States.

The Materials Supply Bureau of the Executive Yuan will be responsible for handling these goods and will entrust several American engineering companies to assist in all handling affairs. When selling these goods, existing commercial channels will be utilized as much as possible. As for American merchants operating in China, they will have absolutely equal opportunities to underwrite these goods. For trademarked goods, the original managers will be handled as much as possible within the possible scope, and all customary sales methods will be used.

### Transportation of These Goods to Be Completed Within 22 Months

China will complete the transportation of these goods within 22 months. In addition to financial assistance, the utmost cooperation of the US military in the Pacific bases will be obtained during the transportation of these goods to complete this task.

China will begin importing these surplus goods in the near future, and a significant portion should be transported by the end of this year.

### Important Speech by Government Representative Cai Wenzhi of the Military Mediation Department: The Chinese Communists Have in Fact Fully Mobilized for War

[Report from this newspaper] General Cai Wenzhi, Chief of Staff on the government side of the Military Mediation Executive Headquarters, accompanied by Major Staff Officer Lu Binglin, flew to this city from Peiping on the 28th of last month aboard a special plane of the Executive Headquarters. Yesterday afternoon at 4 p.m., he made a special visit to General He Yingqin's residence to give the press corps of this city the following account of his views on the current situation: Regarding the current situation, the August 14th message from the Chairman and Minister Peng of the Central Propaganda Department's previous talks serve as guidelines for the work of the Mediation Department. I am not in a position to make further remarks. However, regarding the current general public opinion at home and abroad, and the confusing situation created by the Chinese Communist propaganda war, I would like to clarify the following:

(1) The Chinese Communists announced a mobilization order on August 19th, and then denied it the next day. In fact, since the beginning of August, the Chinese Communists have mobilized all their forces to attack the government army. Their full-scale offensive is that Chen Yi's troops in Shandong and Jiangsu have concentrated their forces to attack northern Jiangsu; Liu Bocheng's troops in northern Henan and eastern Shanxi have concentrated their forces to attack the Chen Hailu Railway; He Long in Shanxi, Nie Rongzhen in Zhangjiakou, Yao Zhe in Suiyuan, and Xiao Ke in Rehe, all four units have concentrated on besieging Datong; and Chen Geng's troops in southeastern Shanxi have attacked Hongdong, Yuecheng, and Linfen south of Taiyuan. All the above-mentioned troops in North and Central China have been fully mobilized for combat. Only Lin Biao's troops in the Northeast have not launched an offensive because they were defeated in the Siping Street battle and are now reorganizing. Regardless of whether the Chinese Communists deny mobilization or announce mobilization, they have in fact fully mobilized to attack the government. Everyone should recognize this and not be misled by propaganda.

(2) The government is preparing to reorganize, convene the National Assembly, gather public opinion, review the constitution, and prepare to implement constitutional government. If the Chinese Communist's communism and its bloody terror policies are supported by the people, it can obtain its legal status when the government is reorganized. It should not openly announce mobilization and attack the government while the government is preparing to implement constitutional government and negotiate with it. This is not a dispute between political parties, but the launching of an internal rebellion by force, causing the people who have suffered from the war for eight years to suffer again from the ravages of war and economic hardship, and destroying the international glory achieved by eight years of sacrifice in one fell swoop, and being despised by the world. This kind of right and wrong, obedience and disobedience, should be clearly distinguished.

(3) The crux of the situation lies in fundamentally different viewpoints: (1) The Chinese Communist Party's doctrine contains no nationalism, so its own interests outweigh the interests of the nation and the people; (2) The Chinese Communist Party attacks the government for being undemocratic, only believing that its land revolution, terror, bloody class struggle, and worker-peasant dictatorship are democracy; (3) The government hopes that everything can be resolved through consultation, so it must implement the military reorganization agreement to nationalize the army and not use force as a tool for political struggle, while the Chinese Communists do not implement the military reorganization agreement, but openly announce mobilization and attack the government while negotiating, and maintain their communist political form in their separatist areas by force. Is this a conspiracy to participate in the government on one hand, creating two governments within one government to subvert it, and on the other hand, to use force to create two countries within one country; (4) The government demands the restoration of transportation so that materials can circulate and the economy can recover. The Chinese Communists destroy railways, making the people even poorer. The government leases American materials and purchases American surplus materials so that the people who lack materials after the war can gradually restore their economic lives. The Chinese Communists do the opposite, so that everyone in China is impoverished, so that they can communize them; (5) The government prays for unity, stability, and construction day and night, so that this economically backward country does not lose the opportunity to build the country. The Chinese Communists create disturbances, destruction, and terror, so that their policies can be completed. If the above fundamental differences in views take the nation and the people as the premise, everything can be easily solved; otherwise, it is just a means for the Chinese Communists to implement their policies.

After General Cai finished speaking, reporters from this newspaper asked several questions, and he answered them one by one: (1) The Anping Incident is currently being investigated by the 25th Executive Group. However, difficulties have arisen because the Chinese Communists refuse to recognize the documents submitted by the people in the government areas; (2) Execution said; (3) Zaozhuang has already fallen into the hands of the Chinese Communists, and the executive group there only has American representatives. General Cai then told reporters in a firm tone: The Communist army is now concentrating all its efforts on invading the Longhai Line and northern Jiangsu, and has no strength to harass Peiping and Tianjin, so the security of Peiping and Tianjin can be guaranteed without worry. General Cai is scheduled to fly to Nanjing in three days to report to the Ministry of National Defense on the work of the electrical affairs mediation office in the past few months. He will stay in Nanjing for three or four days, and then return to Peiping.

### Council of Participating Political Council Standing Committee Passes Important Cases; Asks Government to Stabilize Prices; Major Traitors Zhou Fohai, Ding Mocun, etc. Should Be Brought to Justice Quickly

[Report from this newspaper in Guling on the 31st] Shao Lizi visited the Chairman on the afternoon of the 31st to report on the Standing Committee of the Political Council's appeal for peace and requested instructions on the date of the Political Council meeting. He also had lunch with the Chairman.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st] The Supreme National Defense Council previously stipulated that from May 15th to September 30th of this year, clocks across the country should be advanced by one hour in order to utilize daylight, start work early, and save electricity. It was rumored that this regulation would end at the end of August and has now been extended by one month, which is due to a lack of clarity in the previous regulations. Also, the summer season has passed, and the office hours of the central organs will be uniformly from 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 noon and from 1:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. from September 1st, and the daylight saving time system will still be implemented before the middle of September.

### Anhui Formulates Provisional Measures for Land Disputes in Recovered Areas

[Report from this newspaper in Hefei] Regarding the return of righteous people to their hometowns in the recovered areas and land ownership disputes, the provincial government has instructed the Department of Civil Affairs to formulate seven provisional measures for handling land disputes in the recovered areas, which were submitted to the provincial government's standing committee for amendment and approval and telegraphed to the Party and Government Supervision Group in northeastern Anhui and the county governments for compliance. The most important points are: (1) All unpaid and overdue rents owed by tenant farmers due to failure to fulfill rental agreements before the 34th year should be waived. (2) County and city governments in the recovered areas should strictly prohibit righteous people who have returned to their hometowns from carrying out reprisals against people in areas once occupied by the Communist army, but this does not apply to those who have the right to sue in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Law. (3) Those who own land and those who have permanent tenancy rights who can produce valid documents and have been verified without objection should have their land ownership restored. Permanent tenancy rights. (4) Landowners should allow the original cultivators to continue cultivating under tenancy, unless they are indeed taking back the land for self-cultivation.

### Secret Documents of the Chinese Communist Party Continued from the First Page

First, this strategy can only be effective if all units act in unison under unified command and on the basis of mutual cooperation. The abandonment of Changchun in the past contained some elements of each unit taking care of itself. In the current process of the Kuomintang army attacking us, if we cannot overcome this phenomenon, we will only give the Kuomintang the convenience of defeating us one by one. Here we must point out the mistakes and losses of the past when each unit of the National Army could not act in unison. Second, this strategy is by no means an adventurous policy, but it must be based on mobilizing and expanding the armed masses to put pressure on the Kuomintang army's formation and intensifying the disintegration work within the Kuomintang army as the main strategy, and then using our main force to attack their weaknesses. In this way, they will inevitably collapse, and the vast masses of soldiers will inevitably turn to us. The previous experience of capturing Gui Sui clearly teaches us that the most important shortcoming in military affairs is that we are not prepared for large-scale warfare, military command cannot be concentrated, and actions cannot be consistent. What is particularly serious is that there is no work of ours among the soldiers of the Kuomintang army, especially in their main combat units, so the soldiers who have been shaken cannot immediately contact us. This is such a great loss.

2. Although there are still many weaknesses in the current offensive of the Kuomintang army, the overall situation has indeed gradually turned from defense to offense. Therefore, now we must quickly force them back to the position of counter-offensive and defense. In their current mobilization, there are still many troops that cannot be transferred at once, and those that are transferred are not all joining the front line to attack us at once. There are still many conflicts and hesitations among them over competing for territory or fearing the loss of territory. In particular, the soldiers in the Kuomintang army are tired of war and their wavering mentality towards us is enough to reduce the momentum of their offensive. We must seize these weaknesses and target them to quickly implement the strategy of suppressing their offensive. We must not wait, waiting is letting them gain the upper hand. We must not retreat, retreating is just a dead end. We must not defend a place alone, defending a place alone is giving them the opportunity to encircle us. We must not engage in circle-style guerrilla warfare again, circle-style guerrilla warfare will leave us without a rear, without a position, and even lose all base areas. Our correct tactics are to mobilize the broadest armed masses in the large-scale operations of the group army as the main force and launch the broadest guerrilla warfare in front of, behind, to the left, and to the right of their army to exhaust them, cut off all transportation and transportation to besiege them, and send capable members from the workers and peasants, the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army, especially the captured soldiers, to their army to carry out vigorous agitation to shake their military morale. This will be conducive to our offensive and to carry out separate and destroy attacks on them. Therefore, in the liberated areas, the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army must concentrate their fire to deal with the main right-leaning danger. At present, all decentralized policies, mountain-topism, and circle-style guerrilla escape concepts are very likely to revive. At the same time, left-leaning policies of no contact, no coordination, reckless advancement, and opposition to concentrated and unified scattered actions are equally giving the Kuomintang the opportunity to defeat us one by one. The party and the army in the liberated areas must fight against them with an extremely firm Bolshevik attitude. This is the only way to ensure that the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army can answer the Kuomintang's offensive under unified action and centralized command and defeat their main force.

### Self-Reflection of Chinese Journalists

Today is the second Journalists' Day since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. On this day last year, when the world was celebrating the victory, especially in Shanghai, which had been occupied for a long time and had just been liberated, the significance of Journalists' Day may not have been fully realized. But today, a year later, we are once again celebrating this happy festival, reminiscing about the past and looking forward to the future. Journalists' Day is our own festival, and it is indeed the best opportunity for us to reflect on ourselves. Today, as we celebrate this festival, we must not only celebrate enthusiastically, but also reflect on ourselves, encourage ourselves, and actively take on the task of reforming the newspaper industry.

Before the war, China's news industry was known to be backward. Whether in terms of content or technology, it was far behind the advanced newspaper industries of other countries. But during the Anti-Japanese War, after eight years of arduous efforts, it made considerable progress. On the surface, due to the lack of material conditions, Chinese newspapers could not fully express the characteristics of modern newspapers; but in terms of content, they were able to fulfill the tasks of modern newspapers in politics, economy, society, and culture. Not only could they lead public opinion and serve as the mouthpiece of the people, but they could also report accurate news in the fastest way possible, becoming an indispensable spiritual food for the people. They also played a great role in promoting national policies and maintaining morale. Especially the journalists in the occupied areas, despite the enemy's inducement and threats, were able to stand in their positions and fulfill their tasks of enduring humiliation and bearing heavy burdens. Apart from a few scoundrels who shamelessly served the enemy, acted as accomplices, occupied newspaper offices, and flattered the enemy, the heroic stories of journalists worth singing and crying about, such as Mr. Zhu Xinggong, are too numerous to mention, which proves that most Chinese journalists have the spirit of a great man who "cannot be corrupted by wealth, cannot be moved by poverty, and cannot be subdued by force," which can add to the history of the country. In addition to celebrating today, the Shanghai Journalists Association has specifically decided to hold a memorial service for the martyrs of the Shanghai press who died in the Anti-Japanese War tomorrow morning, which has profound significance.

But while explaining the various advantages and characteristics, the Chinese news industry still cannot hide its internal defects. We cannot deny that the Chinese news industry is still backward.

Looking at the situation of the world's newspaper industry, there are clearly two trends: externally, all countries are demanding international freedom of the press; internally, they are demanding freedom of speech. Because after the painful lessons of this war, the intellectuals of all countries believe that the root of this war was buried in the secrecy and disguise of international news before the war. If we want to create world peace in the future and hope that it can be maintained for a long time, we must seek freedom of international news. As long as they are current journalists, they can freely interview news in any country in the world, without any restrictions, freely transmit news, without local censorship, and freely publish news, without any interference. This epoch-making international movement has been joined by most countries except the Soviet Union. At the same time, peace-loving people generally believe that if the post-war world is to enter a new era of peace and democracy, freedom of speech in each country is also an indispensable condition. Freedom of speech is the life of democratic politics; without freedom of speech, there is no democracy. Political facilities that do not allow people to freely express their opinions will not make progress. Therefore, the people of all countries after the war are demanding freedom of speech. China has been stimulated by international trends and is moving towards this goal.

After a year of efforts by Chinese journalists, considerable achievements have been made in both the international freedom of the press movement and domestic freedom of speech. However, the current situation is still not entirely satisfactory. First, the number of reporters from Chinese newspapers and news agencies stationed abroad is limited, and the equipment for transmitting news is even more inferior. In the world's major cities, such as Washington, London, Paris, and Moscow, there is not even a direct reporting radio station. Therefore, although China has joined the international freedom of the press movement, it is not Chinese journalists who actually enjoy this freedom. Second, although the government has repeatedly ordered local governments to respect and protect domestic freedom of speech, and the government has also abolished the newspaper censorship system, cases of newspapers being destroyed and journalists being beaten, and even falsely using power and arbitrarily arresting people, are still common, and there have been such illegal incidents in Hangzhou recently. On Journalists' Day, we cannot but feel deeply regret and cannot but lodge a serious protest.

But then again. Although we journalists are known as "uncrowned emperors," we are not emperors who are the only ones to be respected. We want freedom, but we also have to abide by the law. Freedom is by no means a matter of breaking through fences and doing whatever we want. The more people who respect the freedom of others, the more people who can fully enjoy freedom. Journalists are no exception. We must reflect on ourselves: Is there any untruth in reporting the news? Is there any bias in expressing our opinions? Can politics be improved by our discussions? Will society become more decadent because of our news? Our pen is not only related to the honor and disgrace of the current country and the safety of the world, but also has an impact that can almost be said to affect the fate of mankind for decades, centuries, and even centuries, and is in the hands of journalists. Democratic countries attach importance to public opinion, and the general trend of politics is guided by public opinion. It can be seen that the more democratic a country is, the more journalists must cherish their pen. As we celebrate this festival, we deeply cherish the warning that "one word can make a country prosper, and one word can ruin a country." At the beginning of nation-building, cherish it, cherish it!

### Strange! The Chinese Communists' All-Out War

What we like to hear most is the call for an "unconditional ceasefire"; what we fear to see most is the strategy of "all-out war." With the intention of all-out war, one will never be willing to unconditionally cease fire; if one has the sincerity of unconditionally ceasing fire, one will no longer be interested in planning the strategy of all-out war. However, these two things that cannot coexist, the Chinese Communist Party actually has both, is it not strange?

A Central News Agency dispatch from Peiping reported that the secret instructions of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party were found in the captured Communist army. The full text is published in today's newspaper. A hurried glance cannot be discussed in detail, but one point that everyone feels is that this secret document, which is the strategy of office, is full of the smell of gunpowder. On the one hand, it said, "We must be able to deeply expand the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army," "We must be able to have positions to carry out large-scale operations," "We must be able to...establish a national liberation regime"; on the other hand, it said, "Vigorously implement the training of reserve armed regular warfare," "Acquire cities with strategic situations on points and lines," "Determine that the Jin-Ji-Cha area is connected to northern Yu-Lu-Su to form a large area,...becoming the central base area of the liberated area." These all fully show that the Chinese Communists were indeed prepared to fight a big war and kill a lot; it is a pity that they were still able to shout peace and unconditionally cease fire on the surface!

What is most noteworthy is that we used to think that the Chinese Communists at most wanted to possess troops and divide China, using this "capital" to participate in the central government, but unexpectedly, in this document, the Chinese Communists have bluntly pointed out the road to seize power. It opposes "remaining in a corner," opposes "drawing boundaries and guarding itself," and opposes "hiding in the mountains"; it no longer allows Suiyuan, Baotou, Datong, Peiping, Baoding, Shijiazhuang, Cangzhou, Jinan, Taian, Xuzhou, Tangshan, and Yuguan to remain in the hands of the National Army. In other words, the Chinese Communists are no longer satisfied with local separatism in a corner today, but believe that in the process of negotiating a ceasefire, they can mobilize the so-called broad masses of peasants to seize the entire political power of China. This truly deserves to be called a strategy of "all-out war"!

Ambassador Stuart said yesterday at a reception for reporters in Shanghai that "a people's livelihood polity must be supported by good people," which can be said to be a pointed remark. Unfortunately, although China has good people today, the Communist Party, which sings peace but harbors war, is lying in the middle, and is deliberately trying to seize power by force. This is the fatal wound to the future of China's democratic politics. Although Ambassador Stuart has a full of enthusiasm and hopes to talk about the reorganization of the National Government first, and then other things, in order to seek a peaceful solution, I wonder if he will be able to fulfill his wish under the Chinese Communists' strategy of all-out war?

### From Rationing to Cotton Yarn

After the victory, all price control laws were abolished. However, because of the continuous rise in prices, the threat to the national economy and the people's livelihood was too great, so various rationing methods were successively implemented. The first to be implemented were foreign exchange and gold, followed by coal and rice, then oil and sugar, and recently cotton yarn.

Although these rationing methods may not be entirely satisfactory in theory, they have undoubtedly achieved considerable results in suppressing prices and cracking down on speculation.

Yesterday, yarn prices rose again, and the black market for oil and sugar has also been rampant recently. Some people are very skeptical about whether this method can stabilize prices at all. We believe that, generally speaking, before price controls can be effectively implemented, the various rationing measures mentioned above cannot but be said to be a good emergency remedy. Moreover, when all materials cannot be fully grasped, there is really no other more comprehensive countermeasure than trying to ration them.

That being said, we believe that there are indeed many areas where the implementation plan should be improved. At the very least, the price fluctuations of all rationed goods must be firmly controlled and not shifted to the black market. All semi-public or fully public black markets, even if they cannot be completely eliminated, must be suppressed so that they cannot be openly unscrupulous, reduce the effectiveness of rationing, and even disrupt the rationing market. As it stands now, these situations of taking advantage of the opportunity to profit and disrupt prices are really too rampant.

We know that for any method to be fully effective, it must have the cooperation of all parties. Therefore, government-run rationing requires the sincere cooperation of the public; and commercial rationing also requires the full assistance of the government. Insufficient external assistance will inevitably affect the operation itself; too many shortcomings in the operation itself will also make it impossible to achieve the expected goals. The rationing of cotton yarn is like this, and other rationing measures are no different.

The main driving force behind this cotton yarn rationing is clearly the private manufacturers. In terms of rationing, it can be called an innovation. We hope that all parties will give it practical support, and we also hope that it will continue to improve itself and truly stabilize yarn prices, and that the black market will not continue to be rampant!

### Philippine Authorities Determined to Quell Internal Strife; Large-Scale War Erupts; Deadline Expires for Disarmament of Farmer Guerrillas

[United Press Manila, 31st] Large-scale warfare erupted in central Luzon today, and it is poised to become an open civil war. Constabulary forces have used artillery in several locations to bombard farmer anti-Japanese guerrillas. The government's deadline for surrendering arms expires this Sunday, and a peaceful resolution is now hopeless. The statements and actions of government leaders are quite firm. The constabulary will move out on Sunday to search for guns, and those who hide them will be killed without pardon. Nueva Ecija Governor Belmonte declared to a public gathering that the Republican government will use aircraft, tanks, artillery, and bombs to quell the rebellion starting in September. The constabulary headquarters announced that large-scale battles will occur in several locations in Nueva Ecija and Bulacan provinces. The constabulary used artillery to bombard the concentration points of farmer anti-Japanese guerrillas. The guerrillas retaliated with machine guns but were ultimately scattered. The kidnapping of farmer leader Fan Li has aroused suspicion among the farmers, and senior leaders such as Lu Ke have flocked to avoid following in his footsteps. It is said that as long as the civilian self-defense forces are armed, the farmer anti-Japanese guerrillas will not surrender their arms. The government has decided to re-establish the civilian self-defense forces and re-arm them, which is the biggest obstacle to a peaceful solution to the farmer problem. According to the Minister of the Interior, not only in central Luzon but throughout the island, the civilian self-defense forces will be given appropriate weapons to help maintain law and order. The so-called "armed peace" means that the more armed forces the government has, the more likely its policies will succeed, and illegal elements will think twice before making trouble.

### Molotov Returns Home Yesterday; Bevin Scheduled to Return to London Tomorrow; Treaty Review Work Intensifying

[Comprehensive Report from Our Newspaper] Paris, 31st Emergency Broadcast: Molotov returned to Moscow from Paris tonight. British Foreign Secretary Bevin is also scheduled to return to London next Monday.

According to Agence France-Presse: The Economic Commission on Italy of the peace conference held a meeting on the 30th and resolved to follow the plan of the four foreign ministers' conference that Italy should compensate the Soviet Union US$100 million. Representatives of the four countries China, Britain, the United States, and France supported the Soviet proposal, which was finally passed by 15 votes to 5. Australia, Brazil, Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa voted against it. This resolution was included in Articles 64, Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the treaty.

Paris, 31st Broadcast: The Military Commission today reviewed Articles 42 and 44 of the military treaty with Italy. The Soviet Union argued that Italy could continue its scientific research work unless it was of a military nature. The Belgian amendment proposal was similar to that proposed by the Soviet Union, so it was automatically withdrawn. Article 44 was then passed. Article 42 concerned the demilitarization of islands such as Pantelleria, Lampedusa, Pelagosa, and Pianosa, which was passed in minutes. Article 45 forbade Italy from using combat materials, including those made in Germany and Japan, which was also passed immediately.

### 100 Million Sparrows Transferred from Northeast China to Japan

Japanese People Both Worried and Delighted

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 30th] In recent weeks, about 100 million sparrows have migrated from Northeast China to Japan. The Tokyo authorities are quite pleased, but also somewhat worried, because sparrows can also consume a large amount of rice. Bird net merchants in Nagoya have now received a large number of orders, and these bird nets will be distributed to rural areas for capture when harvesting begins at the end of next month.

### Hungarian-Romanian Border Issue; Listening to Opinions of Both Countries

According to United Press, the Romanian-Hungarian Political and Territorial Commission of the peace conference will hold a joint meeting at 4 p.m. on the 31st to listen to the opinions of representatives from Romania and Hungary on the case of assigning Outer Transylvania to Romania. It is expected that Hungary will not oppose returning Outer Transylvania to Romania but may propose moving the currently planned border eastward so that the sovereignty of the local Hungarians can still be retained. Romania may insist that all of Outer Transylvania should be under its rule.

The Balkan and Finnish Economic Commission unanimously passed the four-power proposal on the 31st that Romania should compensate the Soviet Union US$300 million. The South African amendment proposal for forcing Romania to provide "appropriate compensation" will be discussed at a later date.

### France Will Merge Northern Half of Germany into Rhineland State

[United Press Berlin, 30th] French occupation zone commander Koenig announced today to the Allied Control Council for Germany that the northern half of the French military occupation zone in Germany has been merged into a state, which will be named "Rhineland State." The government is located in Metz, and its administrative institutions will move there as soon as possible. Soviet representative Salowski of the Control Council commented on the matter, saying that it is incomprehensible why other countries want to change the German administrative structure so urgently before the foreign ministers' conference discusses the German issue.

### Chinese Representative Selected for Five-Power Telecommunications Preparatory Meeting

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st] The Five-Power Telecommunications Preparatory Meeting will be held in Moscow on the 28th of next month. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has decided to send Chen Zongxi, director of the Confidential Office, to participate.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 31st] The State Department announced today that the United States has accepted the Soviet invitation to participate in the telecommunications conference to be held in Moscow. The agenda includes: (1) the allocation of frequencies; (2) the revision of the telecommunications rules established by previous conferences; and (3) the establishment of technical agencies to implement the decisions of this conference.

### US Naval Training Class in Universities; Hoover Gives Warning Speech; Unprecedented Danger in American History Currently Occurring on Islands in the Pacific

[United Press, Palo Alto, California, 30th] Former President Hoover delivered a speech today to 160 graduates of the first class of the Naval Administration Training Program at Stanford University, saying that an unprecedented danger in American history is occurring on the islands in the Pacific. Hoover did not specify what the danger was, only saying that we must expand our defenses, so we must hold onto the islands. We cannot be accused of imperialism because we are not concerned about the commercial interests of the islands. We are only concerned with our own defense and the defense of the world. These naval officers will be assigned to Guam, Saipan, Samoa, Truk, Kwajalein, and Palau. Hoover hoped they would not encounter war in their new places of service.

### Ukrainian Complaint Against Greece Postponed by Security Council; Soviet Representatives Fail Twice; Further Action on Anglo-American Psychological Warfare Imminent

[Comprehensive Report from Our Newspaper] The Security Council met on the 30th to discuss the Ukrainian complaint against Greece. British and Soviet representatives engaged in another fierce debate. According to United Press International, Soviet representative Gromyko argued for inviting Ukrainian representatives to attend and state their reasons. British representative Alexander strongly opposed this. After several hours of discussion, the chairman announced that the matter would be put to a vote. As a result, the Soviet proposal only received the support of Brazil, Australia, Mexico, the Netherlands, and Poland, and therefore did not pass. According to the rules of the Security Council, a resolution must have seven votes to pass. The Soviet Union's eagerness to immediately discuss this case was because Greece will hold a plebiscite today (September 1), which could give it a serious blow, but now that it has been rejected, the case will be postponed until the next meeting. The next meeting will be held on September 3, after the Greek election has passed. The British representative has succeeded in gaining time, and the Soviet representatives' tricks have ultimately failed. Regarding Soviet representative Gromyko's previous proposal to the meeting, requesting that the United Nations provide detailed reports on the circumstances of its troop deployments in territories outside enemy countries, it caused a great uproar in the Security Council, the repercussions of which have not subsided even this morning. The general impression here is that the Soviet representative suddenly raised this case when the other representatives were unprepared, which may be a strategy, almost a part of the Soviet psychological warfare strategy. This Soviet action is an implication that the Soviet Union is preparing to take further action. At the beginning of this year, when the Security Council discussed the Iranian issue, Britain and the United States accused the Soviet Union of illegally stationing troops in Iran, while the Soviet Union strongly argued that the stationing of troops had been approved by the Iranian government. Now that the Soviet Union is blaming Britain and the United States for the Greek issue and the issue of foreign troops, Britain and the United States can cite previous examples to defend themselves. In short, the political divide between the Western bloc and the Soviet bloc is growing deeper and deeper, and there is no sign of any rapprochement in the short term.

### US Opposes Communist Seizure of Power

[United Press Washington, 30th] The United States tonight delivered a notice to the Soviet Union stating that the United States will oppose the communist seizure of power in Korea and that US troops will remain in Korea until a representative government is established in that country.

[United Press Washington, 30th] The United States has apparently abandoned hope of reaching an agreement with the Soviet Union to unify the northern and southern occupation zones of Korea. The State Department announced today that it intends to take various steps to promote democracy and autonomy in the US-occupied zone in the south.

### Nuremberg Tribunal Trials End; Nazi War Criminals Make Final Appeals; Secret Court to Discuss Verdict in Late September

[Comprehensive Report from Our Newspaper] The Nuremberg International Military Tribunal's trial of German war criminals has lasted for nine months and ended last night (August 31). Twenty-one leading German war criminals appeared in court today to make their final appeals. The defendants were completely different from when they first entered the dock. Since September, they have constantly heard the prosecutors present the various crimes against humanity they committed, and they have undergone changes psychologically and physiologically. According to Agence France-Presse, Nazi representative Hess said: "I cannot accept foreigners interfering in German domestic affairs. I was the most loyal servant of Führer Hitler, and I have no regrets." Former Foreign Minister Ribbentrop then spoke, saying, "I only feel guilty about one thing, and that is the failure of my foreign policy, but this is in relation to my compatriots, not to the court. The injustice of the Treaty of Versailles led to World War II, which later generations will surely prove." Goering indirectly expressed regret in his defense yesterday, saying, "I firmly declare that I have always opposed any massacres and atrocities, and if it had been within my power, I would definitely have stopped them. I have no ambition to enslave foreign countries. My only goal is to protect my compatriots and fight for their happiness and freedom." Admiral Dönitz also argued that the German Navy did not engage in inhumane submarine warfare. Former Nazi Governor of Bohemia and Moravia Streicher, an important anti-Semitic figure, now placed all responsibility for the massacres on Hitler and Himmler.

[Our Newspaper Listening to Paris, 31st Broadcast, Nuremberg News] Nuremberg Tribunal President Sir Lawrence declared that the court will begin its deliberations on the verdict on September 23 in a secret session.

### Commander of British Army in Southeast Asia Replaced

[Agence France-Presse, London, 30th] The British War Office announced that Lieutenant General Littler has been appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Land Forces in Southeast Asia, succeeding Lieutenant General Ford, who has been transferred to Commander-in-Chief of the British Northern Army. Lieutenant General Galloway has been appointed Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces in Malaya.

### Chinese Students Testify in Japan; Expose Truth of Japanese Torture; Many Innocent Young People Killed

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 30th] The Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal heard this afternoon the cruel story of the Japanese using "three-level punishment" on underground workers among Chinese students in Peiping. This testimony was given by a young Chinese student who listed at least ten types of three-level punishment methods, including flogging with a horse whip, water torture, palm drilling, fingernail pulling, sitting on a charcoal stove, electric shock, and thumb hanging. Another testimony stated that after two Japanese soldiers were killed in Peiping in July 1940, the Japanese arrested more than 1,000 Chinese students, half of whom were subjected to three-level punishment and died, while the rest were shot. Prosecutors have so far submitted to the court more than 30 testimonies and documents from eyewitnesses of Japanese atrocities in various parts of China, including Nanjing, Changsha, Guangzhou, Jiangsu, Hebei, Hubei, and Shandong.

### Japanese Compensation Plan Drafted; Soviet Union Moves Materials from Eastern Three Provinces; Not Entitled to Share Domestic Assets; China Will Accept Japanese Assets Within Its Borders

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 31st] According to diplomatic sources here, the United Nations has drafted a Japanese compensation plan. According to this plan, the Soviet Union will not be allocated domestic assets because the Soviet Union refused to include former Japanese assets within the Eastern Three Provinces of China in the compensation items, which prevented the Far Eastern Commission from forming a comprehensive compensation evaluation committee to plan for compensation as a whole. According to the estimate of US Compensation Commissioner Pauley, the industrial equipment that the Soviet Union moved out of the Eastern Three Provinces is valued at US$2 billion. Under these circumstances, the Allies decided to negotiate individual deals for Japanese domestic assets, excluding the Soviet Union from the list of beneficiary countries. At the same time, China will accept the former Japanese assets within its borders. The United States and Canada are less concerned about Japanese compensation. The main recipients of Japanese domestic assets are the Dutch East Indies, the Philippines, the British Dominions, and French Vietnam.

### Convicted of Serving as Secretary-General of the "Commerce Control"; Lin Kanghou Sentenced to Six Years; Pan Yang Acquitted and Granted Bail; Gao Jimin, Fei Gongxia, and Five Other Traitors Sentenced to Imprisonment

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday was the end of the month, and the High Court finalized the trials of a large number of suspected traitors. They are: (1) Gao Jimin, president of the puppet *Lili Society*, sentenced to ten years of imprisonment and deprivation of civil rights for ten years. (2) Fei Gongxia, former director of the Tax Division of the puppet Ministry of Finance, sentenced to eight years of imprisonment and deprivation of civil rights for eight years. (3) Tan Tiankai, deputy director of the Education Department of the First District Office of the puppet Shanghai City, sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment and deprivation of civil rights for two years. (4) Yu Hualong, deputy director of the Preparation Committee for the Baojia Autonomy of the puppet Shanghai City, sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment and deprivation of civil rights for two years. (5) Yin Dingyi, former lieutenant general and advisor of the puppet government, sentenced to one year and four months of imprisonment and deprivation of civil rights for two years.

Lin Showed No Expression

Lin Kanghou, director and secretary-general of the puppet Commerce Control Council, was sentenced on the same day by the High Court to six years of imprisonment and deprivation of civil rights for six years, and all of his property was confiscated except for what was necessary for his family to live on. The presiding judge explained the judgment, saying: "When the puppet Nationalist government was first established, you were invited to participate. At that time, you were still able to maintain your integrity and refused, so you were wanted by the puppet government. When Hong Kong fell, you were captured by [the Japanese] and escorted to Shanghai by special plane. At that time, your situation was not without difficulties. Although you served in a puppet position, you did not commit any major crimes, so the sentence was reduced accordingly. If you are not satisfied, you can apply to the Supreme Court in Nanjing for a retrial." Lin showed no expression upon hearing the judgment and was escorted back to prison by the bailiffs.

Pan Left with a Smile

Pan Yangyao, former secretary of the Four Banks Savings Association, was arrested after the victory. The High Prosecutor's Office prosecuted him on suspicion of being a traitor because he served as chairman of the Yongfeng Bank, engaged in business with enemy and puppet banks, disrupted finances, and published the articles "Demands for Autonomy and Self-Respect" and "How to Increase Production" in the puppet newspaper, which were suspected of advocating for the enemy and puppet regime. The case was concluded by the High Court, and Judge Liu announced yesterday that he was acquitted. The reason was that the Yongfeng Bank was investigated by the court and found to be an ordinary commercial bank, and there was no financial dealings with the enemy and puppet regime. The defendant could not be held criminally responsible. The content of the articles published in the puppet newspaper did not contain any meaning of resistance to the government, so it could not be convicted based on unfavorable inferences. When the defendant's family and friends in the audience heard the words "not guilty" yesterday, they all exclaimed. Some were so overjoyed that they tried to clap their hands, but were quickly stopped by those sitting next to them. The defendant's defense lawyer, Jiang Pingfan, requested that the defendant be released on bail, which was approved after deliberation by the court. He was ordered to be available for questioning at any time. His family and defense lawyer rushed to complete all the procedures, and Pan was released at around 5 p.m. that afternoon. Pan, with a book of Western clothes under his left arm and a paper fan in his right hand, wearing a white silk gown, boarded a car with more than a dozen family members and friends who had come to greet him, and drove away with a smile.

### Qian Dasu Under Interrogation: Lavish Talk of Reserve Certificates, Pushing All Responsibility onto Zhou Fo-hai

[Our Report] Yesterday morning, Qian Dagai, the Deputy Governor of the puppet Central Reserve Bank, was personally interrogated by Chief Judge Liu Hangui of the High Court. Qian wore a light grey silk long gown, black cloth shoes, kept long hair, and carried a folding fan. He was not tall, and his appearance was quite similar to Chen Gongbo. After being brought to the court, Chief Judge Liu questioned him one by one. Qian confessed: he is forty-nine years old this year, from Taicang, Jiangsu. He resides at No. 1015, Yuanyuan Road. He graduated from the Commercial Department of Tianjin Beiyang Law and Politics College, and later studied at the Research Department of Meiji University in Japan. After returning to China, he served as the manager of the Dalian branch of Jin Cheng Bank. In the autumn of the 27th year, when the puppet Reformed Government was established and the puppet China Development Bank was being organized, someone was sent to Dalian to invite me to participate, but I resolutely refused. In the 29th year, I came to Shanghai to attend the bank's business meeting. At that time, Wang Jingwei and Zhou Fo-hai had already fled to Shanghai. I had known Zhou before the war. We met by chance, and Zhou talked about coming here to maintain the livelihood of the southeastern half of the country. At that time, I did not fully believe him and returned to Dalian. However, the situation there was very difficult, as the presiding judge should understand. I stayed in the Northeast for a long time and was very clear about the September 18th Incident. After returning to Shanghai, I strongly advised Zhou Fo-hai not to believe the Japanese. Zhou still said that he came here to maintain the livelihood of the people in the southeast half of the country, and that working with him was the same as working with the central government.

At that time, I was forced by the environment and impulsively driven by patriotism, so I joined the puppet government in May of the 29th year. At the end of that year, the Reserve Bank was established, and its primary purpose was to overthrow the enemy military currency and abolish it. Its organization included four bureaus (Business, Issuance, Treasury, Foreign Exchange) and three sections (General Affairs, Investigation, Auditing). Zhou Fo-hai served as the Governor, and I served as the Deputy Governor. From January of the 30th year to April of the 31st year, I also concurrently served as the manager of the Shanghai branch. Later, I resigned from the concurrent position, and Dai Ailu took over. The duties of the Deputy Governor were to assist the Governor in handling bank affairs under the Governor's orders. However, Zhou Fo-hai was very dictatorial. At the beginning of the 30th year, he ordered that all internal and external documents and reports would not take effect unless approved by the Governor himself. Therefore, I had nothing to do. In May of the 31st year, it was stipulated that two yuan of legal tender be exchanged for one yuan of puppet currency. The reason is unknown. This was decided by the puppet Central Political Conference, and the defendant was not qualified to participate. As a result, a total of 4.5 billion yuan of legal tender was recovered. The circulation limit of puppet currency to the north was only as far as Xuzhou. The total amount of issuance when the handover was completed in September of last year was 380 million yuan (the High Prosecutor's Office indictment stated that it was a total of 460 million yuan. The defendant's defense lawyer stated to the court that the defendant made a clear handover in September of the 34th year, but new puppet currency was still issued in January of the 35th year. Please investigate this matter). The Central Reserve Bank used one million yuan of legal tender as capital. The reserve fund was handed over to the Central Bank last year, totaling more than 52,000 gold bars, 5.5 million US dollars, more than 7.6 million taels of silver, and other unknown items. During his tenure, the defendant did not use the convenience of the war to hoard, speculate, or make loans for profit. At that time, the discount phenomenon caused by the shortage of cash was also eliminated by me. Before the victory, I recovered a large number of gold bars borrowed from enemy banks such as Zhengjin Bank. After the victory, I jointly maintained security and finance with Zhou Fo-hai. Therefore, the defendant's motivation for participating in the puppet government was being forced and induced. After participating, I only focused on affairs and never made any speeches or suggestions on administration or principles. The defendant always believed that Zhou Fo-hai was ordered to be in the occupied area to maintain the southeastern half of the country. The court ordered that the case be adjourned for further hearing, and the defendant was returned to custody.

On the same day, many cases were investigated:

Xie Xiaochu

Forty-three years old, from Guangdong, manager of Shanghai Zhonghua Chemical Company, chairman of the puppet Shanghai Chemical Raw Material Trade Association, and special committee member of the Economic Committee of the puppet Central Political Council. When he was interrogated yesterday, he looked haggard and could not stand up. He sat on a chair and answered questions. He was wearing a blue silk robe, white pants, grey socks, old black leather shoes, long hair and beard, and looked worried. He stated to the court: the puppet association was forced to organize, and I could not do business. Supplying chemical raw materials to the enemy is really unjust. These were seized and taken away by soldiers using their own vehicles.

Li Fang

Previously served in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In August of the 30th year, the puppet government successively appointed him as the puppet minister to Romania, and the puppet ambassador to Germany and concurrently the puppet minister to Hungary. In the spring of the 34th year, he changed the China Hongmen United Association to the China Hongmen General Association and hired Japanese military officers such as Kawamoto as consultants. In August of the 34th year, he took his family to the mainland. When he reached Tunxi, he heard that the enemy had surrendered and turned back. He was arrested in Hangzhou. He claimed in court yesterday that he stood up and hired Japanese as consultants because he could not bear to see the enemy destroy the tradition of the Hongmen. This was a perfunctory measure.

You Jusun

Fifty years old, from Wuxi. In August of the 26th year, he organized a local association with the late Gu Xin-yi. It was officially established in March of the 27th year. He served as the executive director and hired Japanese military officers such as Okino as consultants. When the puppet Dadao Municipal Government was established, he once again served as a counselor for the puppet Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Protection Command. After the victory, he surrendered himself. He stated in court yesterday that the organization of the local association was to maintain the locality, and that he assumed the title of puppet counselor in order to facilitate travel.

Chen Zi

Fifty-nine years old, from Hangzhou, chairman of the puppet Edible Oil Industry Association, and director of the puppet Oil and Grain Control Committee. He stated to the court yesterday: before taking the puppet position, he received threatening letters repeatedly, so he was forced to do so and it was out of necessity.

Zeng Ronglin Meicun and Hou Pan

Also, the verdicts for puppet Zeng Rong and Lin Meicun, an employee of the puppet Opium Suppression Bureau, were concluded yesterday and are scheduled to be announced on September 7th. The cases of Wang Shaoting, Wang Yuanqing, Zhang Jingxian, Guo Huimin, and other merchants who aided the enemy were adjourned for further hearing.

### Labor-Management Dispute in the Southern Goods Industry Resolved

The city's southern goods industry has more than 500 companies and more than 3,000 employees. Previously, a labor-management dispute occurred due to requests to adjust wages, which had been deadlocked for a month. Yesterday morning, the industry went on strike. The city police bureau dispatched police to patrol in order to maintain security. As a result, the Lao Zha branch arrested 23 workers, the Taishan branch arrested 2 workers, and the Huangpu branch arrested more than 10 workers. Representatives of the workers petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau for this, and the bureau stated that if work could be resumed, all would be released. In order to comply with the order of the Social Affairs Bureau, the industry's workers resumed work in the afternoon. At 3:00 PM in the afternoon, labor and management were mediated by the bureau, and it was decided that wages would remain unchanged. Salaries would be paid twice a month, with base salaries of 35 to 50 yuan for Grade A, 25 to 40 yuan for Grade B, 21.50 to 35.70 yuan for Grade C, and 18 to 28 yuan for Grade D.

### General Feng Yuxiang's Impromptu Poem at the Literary Association's Farewell Party

[Our Report] The General Association of the China National Federation of Literary and Art Circles held a tea party yesterday afternoon at the Hongmian Restaurant to bid farewell to General Feng Yuxiang, who will soon be going abroad. More than 100 people attended, making it a grand occasion. Feng claimed that he was a retired soldier and was very excited to go to the United States to study water conservancy. He also said that China could no longer fight civil wars and needed peace and efforts to build the country. During the meeting, Feng also responded to the joint request of reporters and wrote a poem on the spot: "Feng Yuxiang, retired, to many places, talking about peace and democracy. Seeing my good friends, already gone, holding the coffin, tears streaming down. Recalling the past nine years, defeated and lost territory, returning this time, feeling completely ashamed, unworthy of the elders, unworthy of the sisters. Today, the cultural circles, friends are bidding me farewell, what can I say, feeling really painful. If culture flourishes, it can rank with the Han and Tang dynasties, if culture declines, politics will not advance. Not just saying it casually, check both China and foreign countries, past and present. A few words from a rough soldier, I don't know what help they are?" In the evening at 7:00 PM, Feng was also invited to attend a citizen movement dinner party. This morning at 10:00 AM, he will also be invited to attend and speak at the public service at the Great Guangming Theater.

### Health Bureau Director Reports on Four Months of Epidemic Prevention

The mortality rate of patients is about 8% or 9%, which is actually lower than the historical valley mortality rate. Recently, affected by the "autumn tiger," the tiger epidemic may become rampant again, so I hope that citizens still need to be vigilant at all times. The garbage problem was also reported. After Zhang finished speaking, Ms. Stevens, the Executive Director of the American Medical Aid to China Association, gave a speech. She first introduced that the American Medical Aid to China Association aims to help China achieve victory.

### Reasons for the Verdict in the Lin Kanghou Case

Special Criminal Judgment of the Shanghai High Court (Special Character No. 256 of the 35th Year of the Republic of China). Public Prosecutor: Prosecutor of this court. Defendant: Lin Kanghou, male, 71 years old, Shanghainese, Secretary-General of the puppet Commercial Control Association, residing at No. E102, Lane 468, Lin Sen Middle Road, Shanghai. Appointed defense attorneys: Lawyer Jiang Yiping, Lawyer Fu Kuanglin.

The right defendant was prosecuted by the prosecutor for treason, and the verdict of this court is as follows: (Facts omitted) (Reasons) The defendant, Lin Kanghou, served as the director, secretary-general, and executive director of the puppet National Commercial Control Association. His position as secretary-general was to handle documents and internal affairs under the orders of the puppet director, and he repeatedly confessed this in this court and during the investigation, which coincided with the circumstances stated in his confession. He first served as a puppet director, holding meetings once a month, and later served as a puppet executive director, holding meetings weekly to discuss association affairs and the purchase and distribution of materials, which can also be verified by the minutes of the puppet National Commercial Control Association director meetings, and the facts have been clearly established. According to the Provisional Regulations of the puppet National Commercial Control Association, the puppet National Commercial Control Association is the general organization for promoting the enemy puppet's new economic policy, and its main task is to handle the purchase and distribution of controlled materials, which is beneficial to the enemy puppet and unfavorable to this country. The defendant participated in this organization and held an important position, which should constitute a crime under Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Punishment of Traitors Ordinance, in accordance with Article 3 of the said ordinance. His arguments were divided into four points: (1) The defendant was under strict surveillance by the enemy, his actions were no longer free, and he was forced to take the puppet position, not willingly betraying and submitting to the puppet. (2) During Tang Shoumin's term as the puppet director, the defendant ignored and did not hear about the association's affairs, and had nothing to say. (3) When Lan Ting took office as the puppet director, he was invited to serve as the puppet secretary-general, only handling document affairs and tightening up association affairs in order to end them. (4) The association rescued underground worker Yang Yu-shen to benefit the War of Resistance, etc. Regarding the first point, it is true that the defendant was taken back to Shanghai from Hong Kong by the enemy army after the outbreak of the Pacific War, and his actions were not completely free. However, his appointment as a director of the puppet Commercial Control Association was due to the appointment of the puppet government, and it cannot be proven that he was subjected to any violence or coercion to the extent that he could not resist. Therefore, his submission to the puppet was not without consideration. Moreover, he held the puppet position for two years, and there should not have been no opportunity to avoid it in the middle, but he was re-elected again and again until the victory. It is obviously a pretext to say that it was not voluntary. Regarding the second point, the resolutions of the puppet Commercial Control Association are the expression of the general will of the puppet directors present. The defendant admitted that he attended the puppet director meetings once a month when Tang Shoumin served as the puppet director in another case. Therefore, he should bear considerable responsibility for the resolution, which is in line with the condition of having criminal conduct as defined in Judicial Yuan Interpretation No. 3101, and he may not attempt to shirk responsibility by claiming to ignore and not hear about it. Regarding the third point, it is true that the defendant served as the secretary-general of the puppet Commercial Control Association and handled documents and daily affairs under the orders of the puppet director. However, the puppet Commercial Control Association is the general organization for promoting the enemy puppet's new economic policy, as mentioned above. Since the defendant and the puppet director had a connection of will and shared a part of the criminal conduct, they were joint principals. Whether the position held was primary and whether the scope of handling was reduced can only be used as a reference for sentencing and has nothing to do with the establishment of the crime. Regarding the fourth point, according to the witness Yang Yu-shen, the defendant rescued the underground worker Yang Yu-shen because his family reportedly asked the defendant to rescue him. This is still no more than seeking favors for private individuals at the request of friends, and it is not enough to talk about actions that benefit the people. All of the above defenses cannot be used as arguments for his exemption from responsibility or reduction of sentence. However, it was found that when the puppet National Government was established, he refused to participate and was ordered to be wanted, as evidenced by the newspaper in the case file, and he was still able to maintain his integrity at that time. When the Pacific War broke out, he was taken to Shanghai from Hong Kong by the enemy army and his actions were restricted again, and his situation was not without difficulties. Only because he had a considerable position in the financial community, he was finally appointed as a director and secretary-general of the puppet Commercial Control Association, which is different from those who willingly submitted to the enemy from the beginning, and there was no obvious wrongdoing during his tenure in the puppet position. After careful consideration of his criminal motives, there is still room for forgiveness, so the sentence is measured within the scope of the statutory penalty in Article 2, Paragraph 2 of the Punishment of Traitors Ordinance, and all his property was confessed in the file of the Military Statistics Bureau. Except for the necessary living expenses for the family, it will be confiscated together. Secondly, regarding the allegation in the indictment that the defendant reorganized his jointly operated Hequn Chemical Factory into the Merui Chemical Factory to manufacture alcohol to aid the enemy, the defendant argued that he only served as the chairman of the Hequn Factory, and did not hold any position after the Hequn Factory was leased to the Merui Factory and was not responsible for the affairs of the Merui Factory. The testimony of Hequn shareholder Wang Zhi-san is the same. Since the defendant had no relationship with the Merui Factory, regardless of whether the factory had any alcohol-aided enemy activity, it is difficult to prosecute him with any crime. As for his appointment as a consultant to the puppet Shanghai Municipal Government, there is no evidence of any substantive crimes, and no discussion should be made.

In summary, it should be based on Article 1 of the Special Regulations on Litigation of Events, the first paragraph of Article 291 of the Criminal Procedure Law, Articles 1, 3, 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Punishment of Traitors Ordinance, the same as Paragraph 2, Article 8, Paragraph 1, Article 9, Article 2, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, the first section of Article 28, Article 57, Article 37, Paragraph 2, and the judgment is made according to the main text.

### The China Textile Corporation Sued for Embezzlement: Investigation Proves Allegations False

Regarding the case in which the China Textile Corporation (中紡公司) was sued for embezzlement by senior staff of the New Prosperity Company (新興公司), a business receiving enemy assets and selling them off cheaply, and for unsound internal organization of the China Textile Corporation leading to irregularities, the investigation team has dispatched personnel to thoroughly investigate the case. It has been learned that the original complaint alleging the sale of small quantities of goods at low retail prices while large quantities were wholesaled to brokers is inaccurate. After retrieving and reviewing the comparison table of retail and wholesale sales of the New Prosperity Company and cross-referencing it with the company's daily sales reports, the information was found to be largely correct. Regarding the allegations in the original complaint that the sale prices were several times lower than the market price but several times higher than the listed retail price, and that the proceeds were reported based on the very low listed retail price, with the surplus being shared privately by Zhang and Xu of the cloth department, resulting in frequent quarrels, and that each person could allegedly earn tens of millions of yuan in extra income per month, the manager of the New Prosperity Company, Yu Naidan, was consulted. He stated that the company's goods were priced according to the following four standards: (1) due to the style and trademark being commonly used by the Japanese, (2) due to the incompleteness of sizes, types, and colors, (3) due to damage and defects, and (4) due to sacrificing a portion of the profit. After valuation, a sales price report was prepared and sent to the head office for approval daily. The price of goods entrusted by the Ministry of Finance and the Disposal Administration for sale was determined by the China Textile Corporation, but the selling price was necessarily higher than the bottom price. The wholesale price was lower than the market price, but some items were sold at the market price. All proceeds were fully recorded and turned over to the public. After reviewing the company's daily sales reports, the information was found to be largely consistent. The allegations in the original complaint that the price was several times higher than the listed price are unlikely. As for the English complaint involving the internal organizational problems of the China Textile Corporation and its malpractices, it was not investigated as it was irrelevant to the receiving and disposal work.

### Futures and Spot Yarn: Few Factories Have Not Received Orders, Cotton Construction Cloth Listing Has Not Changed, Sales of Cold Brand Yarn from Small Factories Are Sluggish

[Report from this newspaper] Cotton Construction opened cloth yesterday, and factories and stores applying for purchase were still extremely crowded. On the surface, the listing has not changed, but the B Dragon Head Fine Cloth at 56,000 is exactly equal to the price of the genuine brand before the exchange rate changes. The price of fancy goods such as electrical slanting and Four Gentlemen Biji, etc., is also slightly higher than before the 19th, but the increase is limited, and it is still cheaper than the black market. Many stores located far in the suburbs also came to open goods yesterday. On the market, the sound of adding 4,000 or 5,000 is still all over the place, fortunately, the black market has fallen by 1,000 or 2,000 yuan, and the people's hearts seem to have settled down slightly. The goods concentrated and dispatched by private yarn factories under the control of Cotton Construction and other institutions the other day were originally allocated according to the spindles of each factory. In terms of its opening price, it has indeed reduced the black market by about 200,000 yuan. Although the market is not "full," the 6,000 to 7,000 pieces of yarn have absorbed a lot of silver capital. Unfortunately, there are still a few yarn factories that have not received orders, so how should the institution that concentrates and dispatches goods be strengthened? It remains to be seen the efforts of the Cotton Construction authorities. Double Horse is the most valuable brand, with thin and long bars, which is most popular with the Guang Gang. Shenxin currently has more than 300,000 yarn spindles, and the output is of course considerable. However, this goods has always been based on opening futures, and the spot allocation is not easy, so the actual users in this city do not welcome it. The yarn factory knows its reason, but it still attaches importance to the store when opening goods the other day. It is also not allowed to be properly rewarded, and the situation of other famous brands is slightly similar to this. As for the cold brand small factory, it is heard that it is still bitter and happy, and Changzhou goods are also 20 counts, and some are only sold for a little more than 1 million, and there is still a lack of owners. Therefore, some observers pointed out that most of the yarn opened by the yarn factory concentration the other day will still flow into the market as chips. Those familiar with the market situation speculate that if the private yarn price dispatch price can be established, Cotton Construction may appropriately increase its listing price.

Also, the yarn market rose unanimously yesterday. Although private yarn factories opened thousands of pieces of cotton yarn packed in 400-pound decorations the other day to assist the authorities, and the opening price was 100,000 to 200,000 lower than the market price. Logically, the market price should be small. However, the yarn thrown out by the factories were not spot goods, and they were successively dispatched after about 10 days, and some were delayed for more than a month. Therefore, customers who need to sell immediately deeply felt that the distant water could not save the near fire, so they released the price to search for spot goods and rushed to install boats and vehicles. Therefore, the spot price of yarn was very popular yesterday, and the 20 counts rose by 50,000 to 100,000, and the 41 counts rose by about 150,000 to 200,000. The people's hearts were abnormally prosperous, and it was agreed that the old brand 20 counts of the Japanese factory produced by Cotton Construction had the strongest rise, and the Fengnian Blue Phoenix had returned to the 1.4 million mark.

### Gold Notes Steady

Yesterdays opened very steady, opened at 2,065,000 in the morning, and there was still considerable pressure after opening, gradually downstream, fell to 2,045,000 before it began to stabilize. After 10:00, the Central Bank allocated 92 bars at a price of 2,055,000, and stood above 2,060,000 at noon. It was slightly tired in the afternoon, but due to Saturday's relationship, there were not many transactions. As a result, the closing was slightly down by 4,000 from the previous day. Gold ornaments, silver bullion, and silver dollars have not changed. The dark discount of silver capital is very tight, and the normal interest rate is about 15%, and there are occasionally special and large users who have raised it to more than 20%.

Foreign currencies are more peaceful. US dollars opened at 3,330 yuan in the morning, with supply, and the low price retreated to 3,320 yuan, and then always hovered between 3,320 yuan and 3,335 yuan. It was slightly sluggish in the afternoon, and the result was down 15 yuan from the previous closing. Hong Kong tickets were affected by the Shen telegram reaching 141 yuan strong, and Guang Gang continued to stuff out in order to absorb silver capital, and retreated to about 700 yuan, and the result fell by another 5 yuan. Hong Kong electricity was 715 yuan, Indian Exchange was 862 yuan, and British Exchange was 1,145 yuan, all of which were available for sale, and there were not many transactions, and the US exchange still stood at the listing price.

### Government Bonds Fell Slightly

Government bonds were tired at first and then stabilized. There were still many bulls who closed, but because a certain number absorbed more than 2 million yuan in face value on behalf of a certain bank in the financial sector, with this help, it was finally pulled up, and the situation was uncertain. The unified C was 2,300 yuan, and there were multiple sales from several companies after opening, and the low price retreated to 2,030 yuan, and then buyers participated, and gradually rose to 2,600 yuan, and was still oppressed by the outflow, and finally remained below 2,400 yuan. As a result, the closing was slightly down 50 yuan from the previous day, and the remaining A, B, and E rose 50 yuan, while the unified D was flat.

### White Coal Returns to Ginger

Yangquan White Coal Blocks and the National League rounds continue to arrive. The coal merchants of the round originally booked 1,200 tons, but because spot goods are not easy to collect in Tianjin, only more than 300 tons were transported. Although the arrival is small, the market heard that there are arrivals, and the market situation suddenly loosened, and the market price saw a slight decline.

### Qinhuangdao Coal Transportation Will Recover Soon

Yesterday, the damaged railways were repaired one by one. Although there were continuous damages, Kailuan was still able to transport 7,000 tons. It was found that Shanghai currently has coal, which is enough for the southeastern provinces for three months, so there is no need to worry about fuel panic. Especially, the supply from Keelung and other sources can be increased month by month, and there is no need to worry. Chairman Xu also stated that the Fuel Committee's coal distribution price will never increase. Although the association supplies public utilities, railways, ships, and main uses, reaching 86% of the total, its selling price is still below cost.

### Bank of China Promotes Low-Interest Loans to Support Domestic Goods Manufacturers to Compete for the Nanyang Market

Before the war, the number of our industrial products shipped to Nanyang was quite large. After the war, the Nanyang market, our domestic goods manufacturers tried to restore, but the interest rate was too high, the insurance fee was also heavy, and the traffic was blocked, so our industrial products could not be exported. The Bank of China, in view of this, sought to promote low-interest loans, support domestic goods manufacturers, so that industrial products could be exported in a source and compete for the Nanyang market, in order to achieve the development of international trade. All domestic goods manufacturers who want to transport industrial products to Nanyang for sale, the bank can handle the financing, low-interest loans, transportation insurance, are given convenience.

After the initial consultation, the loan work has been prepared, and it will be realized in the short term. The interest rate is based on 3% or more and 5% or less as a principle. It is being considered that, in addition to yarn and cloth, each industrial product for export is planned to be transported for sale.

### Chen Zhenmei Creates a High Price

Chen Qimen Also Has a Deal

Chen Zhenmei, who has not had wholesale sales for a long time, is now reported by the industry that export houses in this city have received telegrams from overseas, instructing them to handle the above-mentioned colors.

If it can be smooth, it can be continued in the future, and the foreign sales of Chinese tea can also gradually turn around.

### The Method of Substituting Gold Deposits is Debated, and the Four-Bank Joint Office Makes Corrections

During the war, the gold-converted legal currency deposit certificates of each bank in the rear, when they expired, were settled and exchanged for legal currency in Beijing, Shanghai, or other recovered areas. Recently, the Ministry of Finance stipulated that they should still be exchanged for gold at the original bank. Later, in order to facilitate depositors, the Central Bank of China planned to issue gold-converted deposit certificates, and the Shanghai banks implemented the exchange method, which was announced and implemented. This method, after the business review meeting of the Four-Bank Joint Office, was researched and revised, and was submitted to the 317th Board of Directors meeting for a decision. It has been communicated to each bank for compliance. The amended method of exchanging gold-converted legal currency deposits by each bank in Shanghai is recorded as follows: (1) Expired deposit certificates are exchanged through the collection method. (2) Deposits are all paid in gold. (3) Small numbers less than one tael are paid in national currency, but depositors can consolidate whole taels to exchange for gold. (4) The exchanged zero-sum gold is sold to the Central Bank of Shanghai by the exchanging bank. (5) The price of the gold exchanged for the above-mentioned zero number is based on the date the temporary receipt is issued.

— Wu Yonggang

The rat, the mouse, it is the most detested and cursed creature by mankind. I believe its nature is not so much cowardice as it is cunning and treacherous, which is a more appropriate description. Relying on its agile body, it parasitizes among humans. It hides during the day and comes out at night, and some even dare to run rampant in broad daylight, disrupting our peaceful lives. It gnaws on our belongings, steals our food, and spreads germs that endanger our lives. If we were to compile a statistic of the losses caused by rats in a year, it would certainly be an alarming figure, no less than a terrible war.

I recall that a biologist once said: Given the rat's intelligence and reproductive capacity, if humans continue to slaughter each other as they are now, one day rats will conquer humanity and rule the world. Whether rats can evolve to conquer humanity and rule the world will probably require tens of thousands of years to prove definitively, so there is no need to worry prematurely.

However, there are some facts that now prove that rats may conquer humanity and rule the world, because humans themselves are gradually turning into rats! This does not mean that the human form will change into rats, but that human nature is gradually becoming rat-like. People use cowardice to disguise their cunning, use despicable and violent means to obtain everything, and do not hesitate to build their own happiness on the suffering of others! Whether between individuals, societies, or nations, they are engaged in infighting, theft, plunder, and even resorting to mass slaughter to achieve their aims. The records of atrocities left by Japan in the Far East and Germany and Italy in Europe are nothing more than attempts to use violence to conquer freedom-loving and peace-loving nations, and to have those fascists whose humanity is diminishing and rat-like qualities are increasing rule the world. Because two-legged rats among humans are rampant, it can also be said that rats may conquer humanity and rule the world.

If we want to live like a human being in this era, then we should prevent ourselves from becoming rat-like, strive to be an upright person, take on the responsibility of being human, and participate in the great struggle between man and mouse, because only by extinguishing the rats among men and eliminating the rat-like qualities in humanity can mankind enjoy freedom and peace forever.

The beginning of the "August 13th" Anti-Japanese War can be said to be the overture to the struggle of all mankind against rats. During these long eight years of turbulent life, it is even more evident who is human and who is a rat. Some people, although living a human life, have turned into rats, while others, although living an inhuman life, live like human beings and die like human beings. This play is also a story about man and mouse written in this era.

### Scenery and Color

— Wen Quan

Scenery, here is not limited to a few set pieces; it includes all images of nature, and the struggle of colors with nature. It includes the environment in which the characters in the play act, and the atmosphere of the whole play, highlighting and driving the characters' personalities.

Its new scope is: light, image, color, emotion, and force.

Dramatic art is more concrete than all other arts. However, this "concreteness," when applied to scenery, is only the lowest-level foundation, and what is built on this foundation is: the human spirit and the force of the universe. This is the artistic realm that true scenic art enters.

People act there for all reasons, and the environment changes because of all actions, and the environment changes people again. Their relationship is like the warp and weft of a piece of cloth, neither can do without the other. ... Each person weaves their own history.

The problem arises here, and it will always follow the characters with "development" with joy, anger, sorrow, joy, horror, struggle, and resistance. A few fixed-color set pieces are no longer sufficient for this heavy task. Therefore, the Viennese director Ubong, based on the method of French Impressionists, invented a "color dot intensive method," using various colors he needed, distributed in dense small dots on the backdrop. When red is needed, red light is projected to show the red dots, forming a red surface. Similarly, when green is needed, green light is projected, causing the red to recede and the green to appear. He can change the color as the play progresses, which is indeed an ingenious invention. Unfortunately, when he wants to obtain pure color, he often encounters the obstacle of complementary color afterimages. Also, if white light is projected, all the color dots applied to the scene will be revealed at the same time. This cannot but be said to be a regret, and in our country where improvisation is the norm, even the discovery of this "regret" is still far away.

All colors originate from light. Light is the mother of all colors. In addition to the fixed lines that are not easy to change, all the moving life of the scenery design is controlled by the light and color of the scene and the changes in the fixed colors on the backdrop. If used properly, the backdrop can be made lively, vigorous, and full of vitality. Like the wind and clouds before a storm, it can act as an envoy of the whole play in advance, in a thousand changes, and proudly step into the garden of beautiful art. Otherwise, it will be like a stubborn grain of sand, forever conflicting with the eyes of the audience, destroying your natural pleasure. (In fact, the development of drama should also be as smooth as nature).

The first thing that catches the eye when the curtain rises is the dramatic environment, mood, and atmosphere, which is the stage setting. It not only brews the whole play, gives the development of the whole play hints and pressure, and leads it forward, but also purifies the audience's emotions, so that the audience forgets themselves and immerses themselves in the dramatic environment, sharing joy and sorrow with the characters in the play. In this way, the emotional fluctuations of the characters in the play and the audience can tend to be consistent, and the expected dramatic effect can be achieved.

The other side of sorrow and sympathy is satire and humor. Tragedy requires the audience to sink into purification, while comedy always requires the audience to remain objective. Color is more active and easier to obtain this expectation than line in this regard.

### Weekly Movie Short Reviews

— Zhu Xi

This week, there are more wonderful Western films than last week. Generally speaking, it is still "Lassie Come Home", but "Casablanca" shown in Lido is better than "Lassie Come Home".

Loyal Family

In the play, after the victory, as Liu Qiong made a torrent of remarks, the shadows of various colors and scenes moved away in turn, which seemed better than the ending section.

Lassie Come Home

The director's handling of the dog is better than that of the people. The segment of searching the country of Mi Tu is indeed better than the "people".

The Gay Sisters

There are many wonderful small segments in the film, but it is a pity that the director did not connect them well, so that the play became "not very good". A staircase in the installation is very well placed, and the director has made many plays on it.

Jean Arthur's performance is the most successful. Cary Grant is second, because the play itself is easy to please, and Oldman has no great performance.

Destination Tokyo

It is still good in the navy film, because the director also takes into account how to deal with boredom. The "underwater bomb" segment is the climax of the whole play and the best part. As for the sailor's appendicitis operation, even if it is a fact, it can be avoided, because it does not contribute to the overall situation. Except for Cary Grant, no actor is outstanding.

Suspicion

The lens is special, focusing on beauty and atmosphere. There are a few really good shots, and some very clever shots are discovered intermittently. The ending is very good, just because of the word "beauty". The camera pulls back, showing the train speeding, which is indeed the most beautiful picture. The director squeezed the other parts of the play too hard, and it is not the most successful.

The actor Cary Grant is above the level, and Isa Barret does not perform much.

Deep Valley

Like "Suspicion", it pays too much attention to the atmosphere and forgets the play, so it falls into the abyss of boredom. The opening and character introduction are very good.

The Mark of Zorro

This martial arts film is like watching a martial arts play of Peking Opera. At the end, there is a big set of fights, with clean hands and feet, which is indeed a good choice. Except for the segment where Xiao Fan Bengke plays the jewelry merchant, the rest cannot see any effort.

The Corpse Vanishes

It is not up to the standard, and the clues are not clear enough. The action processing is only the last section of the murderer's car driver escaping and being brought to justice. Gilsey Morris does not follow his heart.

This week, the actress laurel crown was won by Jean Arthur, followed by Cary Grant.

(1) Jean Arthur, in "The Gay Sisters".

(2) Nancy, in "Lassie Come Home".

(3) Cary Grant, in "The Gay Sisters".

(4) Cary Grant, in "Destination Tokyo".

(5) Oldman, in "The Gay Sisters".

### King of Singers: Bing Crosby

— Xin Fang

Bing Crosby neither has a suave and elegant demeanor, nor is he born with a pleasing face. His fame cannot be compared with the former Valentino or John Barrymore; he has accumulated many years of study, continuous efforts, and won people over with real talent. When he was in his thirties, he just began to emerge, and at first he only played minor roles in short films in Hollywood, but he had the spirit of perseverance. In 1934, he had already occupied seven seats among the highest-grossing stars in Hollywood, and by 1937 he had risen to fourth place. By 1944, his reputation had reached its peak; that year, he won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his starring role in "Going My Way", and at the same time, he also dominated the box office champion for that film; in 1945, he won the same throne again. In total, within the most effective twelve years, Bing Crosby has been in the top ten highest-grossing stars in the United States more than six times, and he can indeed be proud of himself.

Bing Crosby has been successful in art; but off-screen he is a standard husband and a respectable father. He has four boys, and his wife's name is Dixie. He often admits that he has only had a romance with Ms. Dixie in his life; it is well known in Hollywood that he is not fond of women, and his wife can indeed be called a virtuous helper. Before marriage, Bing once indulged in gambling such as horse racing, but after meeting Dixie, he abandoned his bad habits and focused on his career; the two have been married for more than twelve years and are still as loving as paint, and who doesn't envy them?

Since the outbreak of World War II, Bing Crosby's singing has truly relieved the spiritual suffering of many people. After listening to his singing, we will forget everything, and a feeling of joy will arise in our hearts. American public opinion says that Bing Crosby's singing is immortal, and people all over the world will never tire of listening to his singing.

The China Wanderer Troupe of the Ministry of National Defense Information Bureau and the China Electric Troupe are simultaneously rehearsing Yang Cunbin's first "Unofficial History of the Qing Palace", which is expected to meet the audience in Shanghai in late September.

The photo above shows the first performance of the play in Chongqing, which was greatly praised by

Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek specially hosted a luncheon for all the cast and crew at the Lixing Society, and took a photo at the entrance of the social room. To the left of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is General Zhang Zhizhong and Zhao Yunru (who plays Empress Dowager Cixi). To the right of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is Yang Cunbin, the author of the Unofficial History of the Qing Palace, and Qin Yi. Behind Chairman Chiang Kai-shek on the right is playwright Kou Jiabi (who plays Weng Tonghe). Behind Zhao Yunru is the fat man Fang Bo.

### About Loyal Family

— Wu Linren

This time, "Loyal Family" was staged under the expectations of thousands of people.

Everyone felt a little excited! Everyone wanted to be the first to see it! This is the first sound of domestic films after the victory! "Yes, the first domestic blockbuster after the victory"!

Seeing the touching performances on the screen, especially when we are now suffering after reflection, everyone was so excited that they wanted to cry. Rolling household registration rice, rushing through barbed wire, hunger, blockade, we have all personally experienced and witnessed these things. Today, when we recall the days of slavery, we still have deep lingering pain!

If it is said that it is a patriotic story depicting a loyal family, it is better to say that it is a great narrative poem. Let us make a detailed appeal of the life we have lived under the trampling and coercion of the Japanese devils in the past few years, so that the descendants of hundreds of millions of Chinese people know what it means to be "people who do not want to be slaves", and let many, many people feel how urgently they need light and freedom!

We feel cordial and lovely in terms of acting and plot. Perhaps it is because we have seen domestic films? Of course, the film itself cannot be said to be perfect, but if you realize that Chinese films are still in their infancy, you will not be willing to be harsh.

With the greatest sincerity, the author hopes that people engaged in the film industry will work hard, and the Chinese people are looking forward to your achievements!

Bless you! Chinese film. The vast masses are waving to you!

### Self-Comfort

— Shao Fu

"The soul is stronger than the sword."

Yesterday, I received a letter from a colleague, describing his departure from his post due to lung disease, which made me feel sad! On the eve of Journalists' Day, I really don't know whether to laugh or cry.

During the Anti-Japanese War, the blood and sweat experiences of journalists are chilling to think about! In fact, even in a peaceful and prosperous era, no occupation in society is more difficult, stressful, contradictory, and abnormal than that of a journalist. This statement includes both spiritual and material life. It is said that a senior figure in the journalistic world once vowed that his daughter would never marry a journalist.

However, there are still some people who continue to follow in their footsteps and are willing to engage in this work, and the reason is Bacon's famous saying above.

If you lose a lofty ideal, it is best to do other business, which is much more comfortable than running around in the daytime and working under dim lights at night.

Today is Journalists' Day. We comfort ourselves, and we also comfort future successors.

### The Birth of Journalists' Day

— Gang Guo

Journalists have a festival, which began in the 23rd year of the Republic of China. The birth of this festival has a relationship with Zhejiang Province. Originally, the Zhejiang Provincial Party Department requested the Central Government to protect journalists in the autumn of the 22nd year of the Republic of China; the National Government approved its request on September 1 of the same year, and issued a clear order for protection. The Hangzhou Journalists Association also called on the domestic journalistic community to designate September 1 as "Journalists' Day."

The first Journalists' Day was held on the anniversary of the National Government's promulgation of the order to protect journalists. However, it was not very sensational or enthusiastic at that time. Several cities where the national journalistic industry flourished, such as Shanghai, Nanjing, Hankou, Guangzhou, and Hong Kong, did not show anything. Only Peiping, Taiyuan, Xiamen, Changsha, Zhenjiang, and other places responded to the mobilization of Hangzhou journalists and unanimously held meetings to celebrate; the newspapers in each of these places also suspended publication for one day to "rest a little."

Our Journalists' Day is born in the flames of war. Since the outbreak of the all-out Anti-Japanese War in the 26th year, journalists have been active on every front line, in every rear area, and behind enemy lines. The intensity of work and the weight of responsibility made us realize the importance of "our own festival" in terms of unity, cooperation, and progress; therefore, this great festival has been celebrated more and more widely and "lively" year by year.

In March of the 33rd year, the government approved this holiday. The following is a telegram from the Central News Agency in Chongqing on March 25 of that year:

"Although Journalists' Day on September 1 has been held for many years, it has not been announced by the government. It is reported that the Ministry of Social Affairs has presented it to the Executive Yuan for approval in conjunction with the Ministry of Interior, and has transferred it to the provincial and municipal governments and local journalists' associations for notification."

The first Journalists' Day officially designated by the government in the 33rd year was held in Chongqing, the wartime capital, by the Chinese Society of Journalism and the Chongqing Municipal Newspaper Joint Committee, at the auditorium of the Central Propaganda Department. More than 150 officials, guests, and journalists attended the meeting, which was chaired by Xiao Tongzi, chairman of the Society of Journalism. That evening, the Central Propaganda Department held a social gathering to comfort the journalists, attended by 407 journalists from various newspapers and comrades from the department. The journalists were "all very happy" at this grand event.

This conference was actually the last grand gathering of journalists in the wartime capital, because the war ended hastily before the next Journalists' Day. Everyone was busy with "repatriation" during the holiday in the 34th year.

As mentioned above, Shanghai had not enthusiastically commemorated Journalists' Day before the Anti-Japanese War; during the Anti-Japanese War, because the local area fell earlier and the concessions were also dangerous due to the environment, it was inconvenient to carry out public activities. Whenever there was a holiday, we could only send our feelings remotely and celebrate with our colleagues in the mainland. Therefore, today's Shanghai journalists are happily celebrating their own festival, which is really the first time since there has been a "Journalists' Day."

### The First Newspaper

The emergence of modern newspapers began with the Notizis Soritte (News Extracts) issued in Italy in 1566. With the invention of printing, various countries followed suit, and newspapers gradually became more developed.

The first daily newspaper in England was issued in 1702, named Daily Current. The first newspaper in the United States was the Newsletter of Boston in 1704.

The first newspaper in Japan was the "Yokohama Daily News" published in Yokohama in the third year of the Meiji era.

In 1815, the first Chinese newspaper issued overseas was the "Statistical Account of World Events" founded by the London Missionary Society and edited by Englishman Morrison, Medhurst, and Liang Wai, the first Chinese Christian from Guangdong.

The earliest Chinese newspaper that was purely capitalized and edited by Chinese people was the "Zhaowen Xinbao" published in Hankou in the twelfth year of Tongzhi.

Among the current newspapers, the longest-standing Shen Bao was founded on April 30 of the eleventh year of Tongzhi (1872). At that time, it was founded by Englishman F. Major. It was not until the first year of the Republic of China that it was transferred to Mr. Shi Liangcai.

### Four More Days

— Suo Bei

Mr. Li Fu's witty remarks

Three years ago, Mr. Chen Li Fu happened to be in Tunxi on Journalists' Day. That evening, at a tea party hosted by Mr. Feng Youzhen to welcome Mr. Chen, Mr. Chen wore a summer cloth gown, waved a folding fan, and talked and laughed. He said: "Journalists: Journalists are accounting teachers. It is more difficult than ordinary teachers; you see, Teachers' Day is August 27, while Journalists' Day is September 1, which is a full four days more than Teachers' Day!" It was both solemn and humorous, and the meaning was profound, and the audience burst into laughter.

### How Many Newspapers Are There in Shanghai

— Qiao Qiao Zhi

Let me tell you: There are currently forty-three kinds of newspapers in this city, large and small, including foreign languages.

Among these forty-three newspapers, classified by national boundaries, there are: 34 kinds of Chinese newspapers; 4 kinds of English newspapers, 2 kinds of Russian newspapers, and 1 kind each of Japanese and French newspapers.

Among the 34 kinds of Chinese newspapers, they can be divided into: 19 kinds of large daily newspapers, 9 kinds of small daily newspapers, and 6 kinds of evening newspapers.

Shanghai Dynamics

### Banning Street Vendors

— Chang Nian

Smuggled American goods will disappear from today. The deadline is too short, and it is difficult for vendors to change careers.

The street vendors in Shanghai today are as dense as scales, and the atmosphere is vigorous, which has never been seen before. It is estimated that there are more than 25,000 vendors and merchants in the city. They sell a variety of goods, including clothing, food, and daily necessities. Walking on a relatively lively street is like walking into a department store.

However, from today (September 1), you will not see the remaining stalls except for book and newspaper, snack, and cigarette stalls, because the municipal government has ordered a ban on the 20th of this month. On the morning of the 28th, more than 10,000 vendors in the city gathered a team in Xikou Road to petition the municipal government, demanding that the order be withdrawn or the deadline be extended, but they did not get results. The livelihoods of tens of thousands of people are about to become a problem.

The rise of stall sales in this city has only been in the past three or four years. It is precisely a reflection of the sluggish market. During the period when the enemy and puppets occupied the area, the poverty of life reached its extreme. Those with courage and strength opened up "single gang" business, and those who were weak and afraid of hardship had to set up stalls near their houses and live on small businesses. At that time, it was profitable to sell cigarettes, so there was a time when the streets of Shanghai were filled with large and small cigarette stalls and small suitcases. Later, when cigarettes were no longer profitable, those vendors changed to other businesses, silver dollar stalls, candy stalls, pastry stalls, ... appeared one after another. Until the victory came, it was still not easy for those vendors to find jobs, so they had to do their old business. At first, the vendors who bought and sold legal tender and fake money were prosperous for a long time. They had keen eyes and only cared about increasing their income. Seeing that American goods were cheap and of good quality and easy to sell, they took the opportunity to resell them for profit, and their income was very good. Recently, in order to avoid competition among more and more "American goods stalls" and to avoid losses to each other, they secretly formed an organization. When there were American goods, they raised money to buy them and then divided them according to shares, and outsiders could not ask about them.

In order to save expenses, the things in the hands of these vendors were indeed cheaper than those in the market, so they were easy to sell, and the income was enough to maintain the lives of two or three people.

The prosperity of vendors is a slightly abnormal phenomenon. If they are allowed to set up stalls for a long time, it will not only damage the appearance of the city, but also hinder traffic. Therefore, this time the municipal government's resolute measures are reasonable. However, I think that the municipal government only issued the order on August 20, and the deadline for the ban is only a short ten days, which is too late for them to change careers. If the facts can be taken into account and the time limit can be slightly extended, the implementation of the policy will definitely be unimpeded.

### Page of Glory

— You Fu

Remembering the Martyred Journalists of Shanghai

Joyfully celebrating Journalist's Day, I am filled with boundless emotion, for this is our very own festival. Yet, in this joy, we can never forget those who sacrificed themselves before the Pacific War, writing a "Page of Glory" in the history of journalists' struggles. They ascended to the cross in order to fulfill their historical mission.

The Assassination of Zhang Sixu—He was the editor of the then-Great American Evening News. Because he staunchly adhered to his post as a journalist, he repeatedly received threatening letters from the traitor Wang Jingwei, including various despicable threats, but he did not yield. Due to the requirements of his position, he had to maintain contact with the outside world, regardless of the danger. Although the police department dispatched a secret agent to protect him at all times, he sometimes refused to travel with the bodyguard and sped down the road in his car. Because, in his heart, he was honest and sincere, and therefore disregarded accidents.

Unfortunately, one afternoon, Zhang Guang-sheng again drove his car to the Chee Hwa Hin café on Jing'an Temple Road. Holding a foreign magazine, he lay on the sofa, absorbed in reading, when the enemy agents had already surrounded him. As soon as he noticed, gunshots flew like snowflakes, and he died on the spot. A Polish man, moved by justice, embraced the assassin on the spot and also sacrificed himself!

The Bravest

The Tragic Death of Zhu Xinggong—Mr. Zhu was the chief editor of the night edition of the Great American Evening News. In June of the 28th year of the Republic (1939), the pseudo "Special Operations Headquarters" issued the first threatening letter to editors and reporters of various newspapers, roughly stating: "If you do not change your attitude, you will be sentenced to death in absentia." After receiving this letter, Mr. Zhu bravely published a public response, which was the article "Confession of One About to Be Declared 'Death Penalty' by 'National Law'," which was widely circulated in Shanghai at the time. Anyone concerned with the newspaper industry in Shanghai could recite this article.

After the article was published, the pseudo "Special Operations" hated Mr. Zhu to the bone, determined to put him to death. At 4:00 PM on August 30th of the 28th year of the Republic, Mr. Zhu left his home on North Henan Road and walked to the newspaper office to work. While passing near the Riverside Mansion, three thugs suddenly blocked his path and shot him in the head. He immediately fell to the ground and died. I remember Mr. Zhu once said in his reply to the traitors and puppets: "If my head can be pierced by a ruthless bullet, then my head cannot be said to be worthless. My head has value, what regret is there in dying?" Reading this makes one feel deeply moved!

The Death of Cheng Zhenzhang—Mr. Cheng was the editor of the international section of the Great American Evening News. It is said that Mr. Cheng usually stayed in the newspaper office and was unusually cautious. However, because he was extremely filial to his mother, he would return home at irregular times to visit his elderly mother. He was already wary, so one day he specially disguised himself as a worker and secretly returned home. Unexpectedly, at half-past ten the next morning, just as he was leaving his house, a car was already parked by the side of the road. Judging from the situation at the time, perhaps the pseudo "Special Operations" wanted to kidnap him to western Shanghai, but in the end, he was shot three times and fell to the ground instantly. Fortunately, the Guangci Hospital was nearby, and he was immediately sent to the hospital for treatment, but his injuries were severe, and he parted ways with us forever at dusk on the third day!

The Most Heroic

The Assassination of Jin Huating—Mr. Jin was a reporter for the then-Shen Bao newspaper. He was also wary and often carried a self-defense pistol when going out, returning to the newspaper office either late at night or at dawn. At this time, he was helping Mr. Feng Youzhen of the Central Propaganda Department with his work, exerting great effort. No matter how serious the situation was, he was always fearless in his travels.

His assassination occurred on February 3rd of the 30th year of the Republic (1941). On the afternoon of the 2nd, he and three colleagues were preparing to return to the newspaper office from a billiard room, but on the way, he suddenly turned back and said he was going to a friend's house for dinner, and told his colleagues that this friend was extremely reliable and that nothing unexpected would happen, and that he would definitely return around eleven o'clock.

He spent that night very peacefully, but at dawn the next day, as he was walking past the entrance of the World Automobile Company on Avenue Edward VII, preparing to hire a car back to the newspaper office, it so happened that all the cars were out on errands. He walked alone on the sidewalk, waiting for the cars to return. Unexpectedly, many thugs had already been lying in ambush and surrounded him from all sides, shooting him indiscriminately. Although he was carrying a weapon, he was unable to react in time and was shot four times, dying heroically. On this festive occasion, I happened to remember the above-mentioned heroic comrades, and wrote this hastily, just to express some inner admiration and grief, and to hope that this spirit of sacrifice will forever become the excellent tradition of our journalists! In fact, since the War of Resistance, in Shanghai and in the rear, there have been countless news practitioners who have been martyred, great unnamed heroes. We cannot fully recount their deeds, nor can we fully know them, but their greatness does not diminish because of praise on paper!
