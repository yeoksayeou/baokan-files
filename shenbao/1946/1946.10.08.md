### The Peace Negotiation Situation Takes an Unexpected Turn; Ambassador Ma Proposes a Limited Ceasefire

[United Press Nanjing, 7th] National Assembly Secretary-General Shao Lizi stated today that the new ceasefire proposal is for a limited time, and within the ceasefire period, there will be ample time for peaceful negotiations to reach completion. Political Participation Council Secretary-General Lei Zhen held the same view as observers, stating that new developments in the peace negotiations should occur within two or three days. Furthermore, according to Shao Lizi, the new proposal is related to the CCP's request that the government cease its offensive against Zhangjiakou. When asked if the government had agreed to this new proposal, Shao smiled and replied that he believed so. He also said that the CCP's attitude towards the new proposal is of great importance to China's peace and hoped that the National Assembly could be held as scheduled on November 12th, but it may be postponed again. He hoped that representatives from all parties could participate in the meeting.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 7th] After careful study, Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart made a final effort for peace negotiations and repeatedly consulted with the Chairman before definitively proposing the new suggestion. Spokespersons for both the US Embassy and the Communist Party delegation kept silent about the contents of the suggestion and did not disclose them. However, based on the reporter's contact with various parties today, the attitudes of all parties were more optimistic than in previous days. Today, a certain evening newspaper here published several speculations on the suggestion as follows: (1) The government will immediately order a halt to the attack on Zhangjiakou; (2) The Communist Party will immediately order a halt to the attack on Baoding; (3) The Communist Party will immediately participate in the discussions of the Three-Person Committee and the Five-Person Committee after the ceasefire order is issued; (4) A limited ceasefire will still be adopted, lasting at least ten days and at most half a month; (5) The National Assembly convocation order will not be issued until the KMT and the CCP reach an agreement. Some people believe that these speculations are indeed plausible. When the reporter inquired with the Communist Party spokesperson, he still refused to answer yes or no, only saying that a ceasefire is the most important thing and that negotiations cannot take place without a focal point. However, the current anxiety is that everything is awaiting Zhou Enlai's response. After Zhou's reply arrives in Nanjing, instructions from Yan'an will also arrive soon. If agreed, Zhou can immediately return to Nanjing from Shanghai and immediately convene the "Three" and "Five" meetings to discuss and decide on all issues. Based on this, the gloomy situation of the past few days seems to have taken a turn for the better. Furthermore, there was very little contact between the parties today. In the morning at 10 o'clock, Liang Shuming, Secretary-General of the Democratic League, went to visit at the invitation of Ambassador Stuart. It was heard that he was told about the contents of the new proposal and hoped that Liang could assist in the progress of this peaceful situation, asking him to forward a letter to Zhou Enlai, urging Zhou to return to Nanjing. After discussing with him, Liang went to Meilan New Village to visit Dong Biwu and had a sincere conversation, and attended the lunch hosted by Soviet Ambassador Petrov. In the afternoon at 3 o'clock, Fu Jingbo, a personal advisor to Ambassador Stuart, visited Liang Shuming again at the Democratic League to hear about the meeting between the CCP and Liang. The situation of all parties today seemed calm. Special Envoy Marshall and his wife took an autumn outing and picnicked at Linggu Temple in the autumn sun. Dong Biwu also took a trip to Yanziji in the afternoon. Shao Lizi and his wife went to the Nanjing Grand Theater to watch the Pingju opera performance by the Xiasheng Troupe.

[Reuters Nanjing, 7th] It is noteworthy that when General Marshall and Ambassador Stuart held an important meeting with Chairman Chiang yesterday, Ambassador Stuart acted as Marshall's translator in order to strictly maintain secrecy. The diplomatic community attaches great importance to the fact that after yesterday's secret meeting, Ambassador Stuart immediately met with Communist Party spokesman Wang Bingnan and sent a special envoy to deliver the conditions to Zhou Enlai in Shanghai.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 7th] After the National Government Memorial Week on the 7th, Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Lisheng, Wu Dingchang, Shao Lizi, Lei Zhen, Peng Xuepei, and others had an exchange of views in the conference room, reviewing the current situation. However, the new suggestion of Ambassador Marshall and Stuart was not mentioned.

[Our Newspaper News] Since the news of Special Envoy Ma and Ambassador Stuart's new proposal spread, the prospects for peace seem to have increased by a glimmer of light. However, according to Chen Jiakang, the CCP spokesperson in this city, the CCP has not yet received this new proposal and only learned from the newspapers that the content is a ten-day ceasefire. What the CCP hopes for is a ceasefire and the implementation of the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. If they are unwilling to have a ceasefire and only talk about a truce, then during this truce period, they will only want to mobilize troops to prepare for another attack. Chen said that if the government insisted on convening the National Assembly under such circumstances, the situation of division would be established, and it would not be impossible for the CCP to convene a "People's Congress" and establish a government. When the reporter asked for his opinion on the proposal for resolving national affairs published by Zhang Junmai of the Democratic Socialist Party some time ago, Chen said that Zhang's proposal had two main points: one was a ceasefire, and the other was not only to reorganize the government but also to reorganize the Executive Yuan. These two points were definitely unacceptable to the government because Zhang's opinions were sometimes even more active than the CCP's when the Political Consultative Conference was held. Chen finally emphasized that the turning point in the situation lies only in a ceasefire; without a ceasefire, everything is in vain.

### Opening of the Fourth Joint Treasury Work Conference; Chairman Chiang Issues Special Instructions Urging Deep Recognition of Difficult Times and Careful Review

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] The Fourth Joint Treasury's branch work conference opened this morning in Nanjing. Chairman Chiang issued the following special instructions: "The establishment of the Fourth Joint Treasury and its branches in the early stages of the War of Resistance was aimed at concentrating the strength of the four banks and two bureaus and unifying their actions to assist the government in implementing financial policies and consolidating the wartime economy. Over the past eight years, efforts in this direction have yielded considerable results. Although victory has been achieved for a year, looking at the country, the wounds of the war have not yet healed. The countryside has suffered extensive damage, and industrial and commercial enterprises are even more dilapidated. The difficulties faced by the national economy and the people's livelihood, as well as the abnormal and deviant dangers that have arisen in the economic sector, are even more serious than during the war. However, China has abundant resources, fertile land, and a large workforce. If the national financial institutions can respond effectively, manage them properly, promote private capital, and help it grow and flourish, the post-war economic recovery can be achieved in a matter of days. This is the greatest responsibility of the Fourth Joint Treasury in the future. All internal and external personnel must recognize and deeply understand the enormity of the task. During this conference, they must carefully review past experiences, learn from them, correct deviations, address shortcomings, formulate effective plans, and earnestly implement them to build on past achievements and create new ones. Great expectations are placed on this."

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 7th] The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce petition delegation suggested to the authorities in Nanjing that factory real estate and machinery should also be used as collateral for loans. According to a responsible person from the Fourth Joint Treasury, using machinery as collateral may be feasible, but using real estate as collateral is unlikely due to various reasons. Furthermore, the Fourth Joint Treasury's board meeting this week will not be held due to the Double Tenth Festival. The Shanghai petition delegation's suggestions will also be postponed until next week for discussion.

Temporary Management Measures for Yarn and Cloth Exports to South China: (1) In order to stabilize domestic yarn and cloth prices and curb the smuggling of yarn and cloth through various ports in South China, the government has tasked the Ministry of Economic Affairs to organize a Business Management Committee (hereinafter referred to as the "Spinning Management Committee") and the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance to temporarily manage the exports. (2) Manufacturers in South China and other regions with legitimate needs for yarn and cloth who ship yarn and cloth from Shanghai to various ports in Guangdong and Fujian must apply to the Spinning Management Committee for allocation after the selling manufacturer certifies the type and quantity. Upon approval, the Spinning Management Committee will issue an export license, which will be reported to the designated customs office for export. (3) If merchants in ports other than Shanghai apply to purchase and transport yarn and cloth to various parts of South China, the same procedure shall be followed. The implementation locations and timing will be announced separately. (4) After the yarn and cloth arrive at various ports in Guangdong and Fujian, the export license must be submitted to the local customs office for inspection. (5) Yarn and cloth delivered to various ports in Guangdong and Fujian are limited to use in the local area or the province and cannot be applied for re-export to Hong Kong, Macau, and various parts of Southeast Asia. (6) These measures shall take effect from the date of promulgation.

Detailed Rules for Application and Review of Yarn and Cloth Exports to South China: (1) The Spinning Business Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs (hereinafter referred to as "the Committee") has formulated these rules to handle matters related to the management of yarn and cloth exports to South China. (2) Manufacturers applying for allocation of yarn and cloth exports to South China must submit an application form for yarn and cloth exports to South China, along with samples, to the Committee or its designated affiliated agencies for review. (3) Applicants must be members of industry associations, have previously engaged in this type of business, and have been certified by the local chamber of commerce as having legitimate needs. (4) The monthly quantity of yarn and cloth allowed for export to South China shall be determined based on the domestic sales and import figures of yarn and cloth in various parts of South China in 1936 and 1937, calculated according to the ratio between the current total domestic yarn and cloth production and the total domestic yarn and cloth production before the war. (5) The monthly quantity of cotton yarn allowed for export shall be allocated by the Committee proportionally based on the number of spindles in each yarn mill. If Factory A's products do not have South China customers this month and do not need to be exported, its allocated export quota shall be withdrawn by the Committee and reallocated to Factory B, which has a greater need. (6) The monthly quantity of cotton cloth allowed for export shall be determined by the Committee based on the production situation of each textile printing and dyeing factory and the overall supply and demand situation in the market.

### Indictment of Traitor Zhou Fohai

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] The investigation of the arch-traitor Zhou Fohai has been concluded. The prosecutor of the Capital High Court has filed a public prosecution. The original text of the indictment is as follows:

Defendant Zhou Fohai, male, 50 years old, native of Yuanling County, Hunan Province, former Deputy President of the Puppet Executive Yuan, Minister of the Puppet Ministry of Finance, and Puppet Mayor of Shanghai Special Municipality. The above-named defendant, in the case of treason numbered 782 in the 35th year of the Republic of China, has been investigated and concluded, and it is deemed that a public prosecution should be filed. The facts of the crime, evidence, and applicable legal provisions are described as follows:

Countless Treacherous Acts

(1) Facts of the Crime: Zhou Fohai was originally a member of the Chinese Nationalist Party, serving as Director of the Political Department of the General Headquarters of the National Revolutionary Army, member of the Jiangsu Provincial Government and Director of the Education Department, Minister of Mass Training of the Central Government, and Deputy Minister of Propaganda of the Central Government. In 1937, the Sino-Japanese War broke out, and the enemy's forces were rampant. During the Battle of Shanghai, our National Government decided on a long-term war of resistance. However, the traitor Wang Zhaoming, with the intention of violating the central government's established national policy, conspired with Zhou Fohai, Mei Siping, and Gao Zongwu to secretly advocate for peace negotiations. After the fall of Nanjing and Shanghai, and the government moved west, their efforts to promote peace became even more active. Mei Siping and Gao Zongwu first secretly went to Shanghai to negotiate a basic plan for humiliating and surrendering peace with Izumihara Akira and Imai Takeo, representatives of the Japanese military. They then flew from Shanghai to Hong Kong and then to Chongqing, secretly presenting the plan to Wang, who approved the enemy's plan and secretly advocated for peace. Zhou Fohai followed closely, participating in the matter from beginning to end. At the end of 1938, he accompanied Wang to Hanoi, Vietnam, where Wang drafted a telegram advocating peace, which was handed over to Zhou Fohai and Chen Gongbo to be published in Hong Kong. This echoed the statement issued by Japanese Prime Minister Konoe Fumimaro, hoping to confuse the public and shake the decision to resist Japan. On April 12, 1939, he went to Shanghai with Mei Siping to gather party members to promote the peace movement. On May 5 of the same year, he accompanied Wang to Tokyo, Japan, with Mei Siping, Gao Zongwu, Zhou Longxiang, and others, to secretly discuss peace terms with the enemy leaders. After returning to China, he used the slogan of "Peace, Anti-Communism, and National Reconstruction" to convene the Sixth National Congress of the Puppet Chinese Nationalist Party in Shanghai and issued a declaration. Zhou Fohai was elected as a Standing Committee member of the Puppet Central Executive Committee. Together with Mei Siping, Lin Baisheng, Zhou Longxiang, and Japanese representatives Izumihara Akira and Sugiyama, they discussed the "Draft of the Basic Treaty on Sino-Japanese Relations." Subsequently, he attended the Qingdao Conference to discuss the reorganization of the two puppet governments, "Provisional" and "Reformed." After the agreement was reached, on March 30, 1940, in the manner of the National Government returning to the capital, the puppet National Government was jointly established in Nanjing, and a declaration was issued stating that all laws, regulations, treaties, and agreements of our National Government were invalid. At that time, Wang served as the puppet chairman, and Zhou Fohai served as the puppet minister of finance, and successively concurrently served as the director of the puppet Central Finance Committee, the legal review member and secretary-general of the puppet Central Political Committee, the member of the puppet Military Committee, the vice president of the puppet Executive Yuan, the president of the puppet Central Reserve Bank, the commander of the puppet Tax Police Corps, the member and secretary-general of the puppet Supreme National Defense Conference, the chairman of the Enemy and Puppet Management Committee, the chairman of the puppet Materials Control Review Committee, the vice chairman of the puppet Military Committee, and the puppet Mayor of Shanghai Special Municipality and concurrent puppet Shanghai Security Commander, and the warden of the Shanghai Special Municipal Police Bureau, wielding military, political, and economic power, and was deeply trusted by Wang. During his tenure in the puppet government, he followed the enemy's will, issued puppet currency indiscriminately, disrupted finance, and supplied the enemy with money and materials to increase the enemy's strength for aggression. On November 30, 1940, he formally signed the "Basic Treaty on Sino-Japanese Relations" with the Japanese in Nanjing, allowing the Japanese to station troops in Mengjiang and North China, station fleets in our country's waters, and implement economic cooperation. At the same time, he issued the "Joint Declaration of China, Japan, and Manchukuo," recognizing "Manchukuo" and undermining the integrity of our country's territory. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, he echoed the Japanese and, on January 9, 1943, declared war on the Allied nations of Britain and the United States in the name of the puppet National Government and concluded an alliance treaty with the Japanese. He also visited puppet "Manchukuo" as a puppet special envoy, using it to curry favor with the enemy. Countless treacherous acts cannot be enumerated. After the Japanese surrendered, he was arrested and investigated by the Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the Military Affairs Commission and brought to the court for investigation.

The Evidence of the Crime is Extremely Solid

(2) Evidence and Applicable Legal Provisions: The defendant Zhou Fohai in this case colluded with the enemy with Wang Zhaoming, secretly negotiated peace, and jointly organized the puppet National Government. He successively held the aforementioned important puppet positions, issued orders under the protection of the Japanese, and resisted the central government. During his tenure in the puppet government, he indiscriminately issued puppet currency, disrupted finance, and supplied the enemy with money and materials to increase the enemy's strength for aggression. He himself admitted this without hesitation. Furthermore, the puppet National Government Gazette and the puppet Finance Gazette, which were investigated in this case, contain various official documents issued by the defendant in his capacity as the puppet Minister of Finance, which can be used as evidence. As for how he planned peace, accompanied Wang to Hanoi and then to Hong Kong to send a telegram advocating peace, to echo the peace statement of the Japanese leader Kintetsu Fumi; how he went to Japan to visit the enemy's leading figures to discuss the organization of the puppet government; and how, after returning to China, he participated in the Sixth National Congress of the Puppet Kuomintang, discussed the draft peace treaty with the Japanese, advocated peaceful fallacies, and obstructed the national policy of resistance; how he traveled to Qingdao and Shanghai to negotiate the establishment of the puppet government, betrayed the central government, and undermined the overall war of resistance; how he concluded the Basic Treaty on Sino-Japanese Relations with the enemy, issued the Joint Declaration of China, Japan, and Manchukuo, and openly recognized the puppet "Manchukuo," selling out the interests of the nation and the country; how he declared war on the Allied nations of Britain and the United States in the name of the puppet government after the outbreak of the Pacific War, isolating our central war of resistance camp; and how he visited the puppet "Manchukuo" to curry favor with the enemy. He also confessed to each of these matters in detail, which are consistent with Hai Siping's statement in another case. Furthermore, the commemorative album of the return to the capital of the puppet National Government (as well as various documents on peace, anti-communism, and national construction) investigated in this case can be used as reference. This is solid evidence of his collusion with the Japanese, violation of national policy, organization of the puppet government, and betrayal of the central government.

The Defense Is Not Worth Refuting

As for the defendant's defense, it is nothing more than: (1) Organizing the puppet government to try to explore peace, shake the enemy's morale, reduce the suffering of the people in the occupied areas, and that organizing the puppet government in the occupied areas had no impact on the war of resistance camp; (2) The defendant once entrusted someone to surrender to the central government in the winter of 1942, providing military intelligence, establishing radio stations, deploying military affairs, coordinating the national army's counterattack, rescuing central underground workers, and assisting the central government in developing party affairs and culture in the occupied areas; (3) After the victory, the defendant was appointed as the commander of the Shanghai Action Corps,恪恪遵 central government's will, responsible for maintaining the security of Shanghai and the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, preventing traitors and puppets, and stabilizing people's hearts. When the national army and central government takeover personnel arrived in Shanghai one after another, he handed over all the military and police under his command to the central government for takeover, which was not without merit. However, regarding the first point, long-term resistance was the unanimous and firm proposition of our entire country, both government and people. The defendant and Wang Zhaoming deliberately violated the established national policy of the central government and arbitrarily negotiated peace with the Japanese, which was already an act of betrayal. Moreover, he followed the enemy's will to organize a puppet National Government, seize the situation in the southeast, and form a separatist situation. How profound was its impact on the people's psychology and international opinion? Now, to still say that it was to explore peace and did not hinder the war of resistance, is this not a cover-up and self-deception? As for all the false policies implemented by the puppet government in the occupied areas, such as recruiting puppet troops, selling opium publicly, indiscriminately issuing puppet currency, plundering materials, enslaving young people, and using rural cleansing to implement blockades, none of these were not harmful to the country and the people. To say that it was to save the people and relieve suffering is even more turning black into white and reversing right and wrong. Furthermore, since the establishment of the puppet government, training puppet troops has not only consolidated the enemy's rear but also helped the enemy attack our defense lines, which has caused the enemy's flames to become more intense and aggression more violent. The defendant's so-called shaking the enemy's morale has, in fact, added wings to the enemy's tiger with the help of the enemy's troops, which is contrary to his intention. Regarding the second point, the defendant said that in the winter of 1942, he entrusted someone to surrender to the central government. Even if he only spoke empty words, it is not enough to believe deeply. Even if it is not false, the defendant was clearly wanted by the Procuratorate of the Supreme Court as early as November 4, 1939. He did not voluntarily surrender and be tried before the crime was discovered. This does not meet the requirements of surrender, so it cannot be used as a reason to seek leniency. As for rescuing underground workers, secretly reporting enemy intelligence, contacting the national army, preparing for a counterattack, and assisting the central government in developing party affairs and culture in the occupied areas, even if these things were true, it was only after the outbreak of the Pacific War that the international situation was clearly unfavorable to the enemy. Anyone with a little international common sense could easily predict the outcome. The defendant showed a tendency to the central government and took these actions because he hoped to preserve himself and leave room for retreat. How can he hope to be forgiven by doing this? Regarding the third point, at that time, the defendant, in the area of Shanghai and the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, had supervised his troops to jointly maintain local security with the enemy troops and hand over all military and police forces. The Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the Military Affairs Commission did state in the transfer document that this was true. However, the former, his maintenance of security, was only when he was at the end of his rope, trying to cover up his past mistakes. The latter, handing over military power, was under the strict supervision of our advancing troops, so he had no choice but to submit. What merit is there to speak of?

In summary, all of the above defenses are nothing more than various attempts to embellish his words in the hope of reducing or eliminating his guilt, and none of them are acceptable. The defendant's actions constitute a violation of Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors. Therefore, in accordance with Article 1 of the Special Criminal Cases Litigation Regulations and Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, a public prosecution is filed, and it is respectfully requested that a legal trial be conducted.

### Luo Junqiang's Rebellious Heart: Willing to Serve the Enemy, A Traitorous Crime Bringing Disaster to the Country and People

[Nanjing Telegraph, 7th] The indictment of the traitor Luo Junqiang was drafted by Prosecutor Wang Wenzhun. It recounts that the traitor Luo fled to Hong Kong in February of the 28th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1939], went to Shanghai in August to participate in the "Reformed" puppet government, and on March 30th of the 29th year [1940], when the puppet government returned to the capital [Nanjing], he served as the Chairman of the Frontier Affairs Committee. In the 31st year [1942], he served as the Minister of Puppet Judicial Administration; in the spring of the 33rd year [1944], he served as the Puppet Governor of Anhui Province and concurrently as the Director of the Bengbu Pacification Headquarters. Later, he co-founded the Tax Police School with the traitor Zhou Fohai, serving concurrently as the Director of Education. He also founded the Tax Police Corps, serving as both the Commander and Deputy Commander, as well as the Secretary-General of the Puppet Shanghai Special Municipal Government. During his tenure in these various puppet positions, he colluded with the traitor Zhou, betrayed the country to serve the enemy, oppressed the people, disrupted finances, plundered materials to aid the enemy, and established private armed forces, all of which are substantiated. Moreover, his article "Matters Concerning Welcoming Japanese Members of the House of Representatives to China," written at the end of the 29th year [1940] in his capacity as a member of the "East Asia League China Comrades Association," vividly demonstrates his willingness to serve the enemy and harm the country. Therefore, although the traitor Luo argued that his assumption of puppet positions was merely due to "personal emotional relations with Zhou Fohai and that he had no intention of harming the people or resisting his own country," this is insufficient to conceal the obvious and documented facts of his crimes. As for his false claim that "he was in contact with the Central Government before and after the victory and conducted subversive work, contributing to the takeover," it is entirely based on empty words without any evidence. Even if there were evidence, it would only be opportunistic and would not reduce his deserved punishment. Considering his actions, he has committed the crime stipulated in Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors. Therefore, in accordance with Article 1 of the Special Criminal Case Litigation Regulations and Article 231, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, he is being prosecuted.

Editorial

### Welcome to the British Commercial Delegation and Mrs. Cripps

The British Commercial Delegation will arrive in Shanghai by plane today. At the same time, Mrs. Cripps, Chairman of the British United Aid to China Fund, along with her daughter, will also arrive in the capital by special plane tomorrow. Although the missions and tasks of the Commercial Delegation and Mrs. Cripps are different, they both represent the concern of our wartime allies for us. We would like to express our sincere welcome to them.

The relationship between China and Britain has always been close. This traditional relationship has been further solidified by this war of resistance against aggression. At a time when human civilization felt the most serious threat, it was Britain that independently resisted the Nazi flames in Europe. When all of Europe was swept away by darkness, it was only Britain that illuminated the hearts of people in Europe and even around the world. The retreat of the Dunkirk army and the Battle of Britain were matters of concern to all people with a sense of justice around the world. The arduous struggle of the British military and civilians led to the failure of Göring and his invincible air force, which was a harbinger of the collapse of the Nazis. We Chinese people understand all this most clearly, because China has faced much the same in the Far East. We Chinese people, during the eight years of war, also bravely resisted the aggression of the Japanese militarists in East Asia for the first four years, much like the British people. The people of China and Britain naturally understand each other best in this situation. What particularly inspires us is the concern of the British United Aid to China Fund, led by Mrs. Cripps, for the Chinese people. Even when the war in Europe was raging, they still sent us material assistance from time to time. The Chinese people will always be grateful for this expression of true affection and will never forget it. We know that Britain itself was undergoing an unprecedented struggle at the time, but it was still able to take care of us from time to time. This spirit of friendship moves us. This is truly the highest expression of human love. And all of this was only possible under the leadership and advocacy of Mrs. Cripps. We would like to express our deep gratitude to this friend of China.

However, relations between nations are not entirely built on humanitarian foundations. That is why we are particularly pleased with the arrival of the British Commercial Delegation. The economic relationship between China and Britain has always been close. Many of the tall buildings standing in Shanghai, the center of Chinese industry and commerce, have been dedicated to promoting the economic relationship between China and Britain. In the past two or three decades, the economic relationship between China and Britain has been affected by the rise of Japan. Britain's original position as the leader in China's international trade was eventually seized by Japan. Now that Japan has been defeated and the world situation is new, the British Commercial Delegation's arrival at this time will, we believe, be of great benefit to promoting the economic relationship between China and Britain, especially in trade relations. As the delegation arrives, we would like to briefly express our views on Sino-British trade relations.

First, since the victory a year ago, China's political situation has not yet stabilized, resulting in traffic congestion and a major impact on foreign trade. At present, China's foreign trade is showing abnormal development. This is an unavoidable phenomenon when the post-war order has not yet returned to normal. Under the current circumstances, we see a large number of unnecessary, often luxury, imports, while export trade has not yet regained its proper position. According to figures released by the London Foreign Trade Authority, between August of last year and March of this year, the value of British exports to China was 1.04 million pounds, while the value of imports from China during the same period was only 180,000 pounds, with Britain exporting 960,000 pounds more than it imported from China. In China, this means that we had a trade deficit of 960,000 pounds with Britain during these six months. Although this figure is not very alarming, it does indicate that Sino-British trade has not yet returned to normal. How to normalize Sino-British trade is not a simple matter, but it is a major issue for the Commercial Delegation.

Second, China has resisted the aggression of the Japanese militarists for the longest time and suffered the deepest wounds. Now that the war is over, it is eager to rebuild the country. Therefore, in our national economic life in the future, we cannot allow the previous laissez-faire freedom. Although we do not advocate adopting a planned economy, we cannot but have a considerable plan. The past era is past and will never return. At this time, it is beneficial to both parties to review the future of Sino-British trade. Because the commercial relationship between China and Britain is relatively long-standing, the Chinese people have a good understanding of British goods. Good quality, durability, and reliability represent the general Chinese people's perception of British goods. Therefore, the Chinese people are very willing to see Sino-British trade relations return to their former prosperity. However, China will embark on the road of national construction in the future, and we hope that Britain's exports to China can be more inclined to industrial tools such as machinery, to assist in our country's reconstruction. This will not only be of great benefit to China's national construction, but also make China's industry prosperous, increase purchasing power, and establish a permanent and good foundation for Sino-British relations.

Third, since the signing of the Sino-British New Treaty in 1945, it was originally scheduled to conclude a Sino-British commercial treaty within six months, but due to the war at that time, and then due to the return of the National Government to the capital and other reasons, it was repeatedly delayed. Now that the environment has changed, and it is heard that the Sino-American commercial treaty has also been drafted, this is the time to start the signing of the Sino-British commercial treaty, to lay the foundation for rebuilding trade with China. As for other aspects related to Sino-British trade, the delegation will gain much from observing the major cities of China. However, there is one point that may be worth mentioning at this time, that is, the methods used by British businesses in China or for China should be reformed as necessary due to changes in the times. The comprador class has been deeply involved in China's foreign trade in the past, but it has a very bad impression in the minds of the Chinese people. If future Sino-British trade still has to go through these notorious comprador systems, it will not be well received by the Chinese people. This era is past, and we must sincerely welcome the arrival of the new era.

We wish Mrs. Cripps a pleasant stay and good health! We wish all members of the British Commercial Delegation a pleasant stay and good health!

### Where is Chinese Business Going?

The Shanghai market is undoubtedly dominated by wholesale businesses. Their customers are from the neighborhoods nearby and from provinces far away. Their goods encompass the world and local products. All kinds of tea parties, associations, and markets are their places of activity. Among them, the oldest can be traced back to the Ming Dynasty, and the most powerful have branches in Southeast Asia, Japan, and other places, or even have their own warehouses, workshops, factories, and financial institutions. In short, these wholesale businesses are the backbone of Shanghai's commerce.

However, these core members are only a minority. Don't most businesses simply take in on the left and put out on the right? In terms of imports, they have never directly ordered goods from abroad. In terms of exports, they have never directly sourced goods from the interior. Their scope of activity is simply to move existing materials around locally, making a profit in the process. Times have changed, and there is much antipathy towards this class of middlemen. First, the more intermediaries, the higher the cost, which fuels rising prices. Second, speculation and hoarding are created by this situation. Third, they are purely profit-takers, not producers. The modern cooperative system is designed to target these middlemen. The currently expanding direct distribution and rationing systems also aim to bypass these middlemen. These new systems are still in their infancy, but their potential cannot be underestimated. Those middlemen should already be feeling a considerable threat.

Here are a few examples: When textile factories opened yarn sales, yarn brokers were always left out in the cold, unable to get any scraps, leading to complaints. The Taiwan Sugar Company once bypassed sugar merchants and directly distributed and sold to retail stores, causing a great uproar. Several vegetable cooperatives were organized in western and southern Shanghai, which repeatedly clashed with merchants. The Fuel Management Committee monopolized the coal trade, and coal merchants had to rely on firewood, charcoal, and coal briquettes to keep their businesses afloat. The Social Affairs Bureau's rice distribution targeted retail rice stores. When the Rice Price Review Committee was not established, the general rice stores were at a loss when they could not purchase white rice. Now edible oil is also going to be directly distributed. Direct transactions of wheat (between merchants) are strictly prohibited. Since the establishment of the China Silk Corporation and the large-scale tea companies, the original silk and tea merchants have also been overshadowed. During the livestock market period, the original pig merchants and pig stalls were even closed together. In light of this, the major types of commerce have already encountered problems due to the trend of the times.

We know that manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers each have their own tasks and functions. It is impossible to completely eliminate any part of them. However, in this time of economic crisis, it is equally impossible to return to the laissez-faire state of before the war. Don't we see that the regulatory policies of countries like Britain and the United States have not been completely abandoned to this day? Today, our country's foreign exchange is controlled, and exports are subject to considerable restrictions. In addition, the lack of materials and high prices have forced the government to adopt flat-price measures such as rationing. On the one hand, various consumer cooperatives are also being widely promoted. These facilities are somewhat in conflict with the interests of general businesses. However, due to the trend of the times, it cannot be avoided, at least for a considerable period. Therefore, in order to maintain their original business and take care of the business and livelihoods of this large group of people, they must adapt to this trend and actively make remedies and innovations to adapt to this new environment. If they do not do this, it would be tragic to simply listen to fate and be eliminated. Even seeking sympathy by going against history will not help.

### Most County Magistrate Handover Procedures Unfinished; Zhejiang Provincial Government Determined to Rectify; Listed as Central Task, Representatives Dispatched to Supervise and Urge

[Hangzhou Telegraph, 7th] The matters of appointment and removal of county magistrates in Zhejiang Province have been very frequent, which has attracted attention from all parties. According to this newspaper's reporter's investigation, as of the end of September this year, there were a total of 285 cases, but only 121 have been settled. The remaining 164 are still pending. Among these 164 unfinished cases, in addition to 48 that can be settled and 26 that have not reached the prescribed deadline, the unfinished situations can be divided into five categories: (1) 44 cases have not been inspected by the successor; (2) 47 cases have begun inspection; (3) 34 cases have not completed handover due to loss of files; (4) 55 cases have incomplete handover procedures; (5) 10 cases have not been reported after inspection. Since there are so many cases of unclear handover, the people's suspicion is also increasing day by day. Therefore, the provincial government has listed this as one of the important central tasks and is determined to rectify it. It has dispatched special personnel to the counties to guide and supervise. At the same time, it has presented a list of the unfinished county magistrate handovers to Chairman Shen for approval, so that they can be completed quickly.

### Wang Maogong Travels Tirelessly to Stabilize Grain Prices in Wujiang and Kunshan

[Suzhou Telegraph, 7th] Chairman Wang of Jiangsu Province was originally scheduled to return to the province at 12:00 p.m. on the 6th, but in view of the fact that grain prices in the rice-producing areas adjacent to this county also affect the people's food supply on the Shanghai-Nanjing line, it is necessary to thoroughly control and assess the situation. In order to fundamentally stabilize grain prices on the Shanghai-Nanjing line, he temporarily changed his itinerary and stayed overnight in Suzhou. At 7:00 a.m. on the 7th, he, together with Xu Shiguang, the commissioner of the Second District, Da Jianhua, the magistrate of Suzhou County, and his entourage, took a car to Wujiang. In addition to strictly ordering the suppression of grain prices to be lower than those in Suzhou and Wuxi, he also convened the leaders of the county to listen to reports and gave earnest instructions. He then returned to Suzhou at noon and went to Kunshan at about 1:00 p.m., before returning to the provincial capital.

[Kunshan Telegraph, 7th] Wang Maogong, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, arrived in Kunshan from Suzhou at 2:00 p.m. on the 7th, accompanied by Zhou Youmin, Secretary of the Provincial Government, and others to inspect the area. The county government convened a symposium of leaders of various agencies at 3:30 p.m., where Chairman Wang gave a speech, providing detailed instructions on current important issues such as bandit suppression, land tax, and food supply. Regarding the high grain prices, he personally spoke to the responsible authorities, urging them to effectively suppress prices to alleviate the suffering of the people.

[Wuxi Report] The grain market in this city has recently experienced a sharp fluctuation, with rice, wheat, and flour all rising in price. Among them, white rice has risen most sharply, once breaking the 70,000 mark. Flour is almost reaching 20,000 yuan, and the common people are crying out in agony. Premier Song of the Executive Yuan, upon hearing about the grain prices in Wuxi, believed that it would affect the Shanghai grain market and was deeply related to the food supply of the military and civilians. According to the report of Minister Xu of the Ministry of Food, when grain was exported from Wuxi, the local government had difficulty in levying taxes. He specially summoned Wang Maogong, Chairman of Jiangsu Province, and instructed him to quickly investigate the truth and seek countermeasures to suppress prices. After receiving the order, Wang took a car from Nanjing to Wuxi at 8:00 p.m. on the 5th. After getting off the car, he went directly to the county government and immediately summoned representatives from the county Chamber of Commerce and the grain and cloth industries to hold a discussion. Wang reported the purpose of coming to Wuxi, saying that Premier Song was very concerned about the prices in Wuxi. Recently, Shanghai has also been panicked due to rumors of the foreign exchange rate being listed at any time, causing market fluctuations. Mayor Wu reported the situation in Shanghai to the Chairman, and also mentioned that the highest rice price in Shanghai was only about 60,000 yuan, while Wuxi's price had risen beyond the 70,000 mark, which was very inappropriate. Rice prices have a great impact on society, and he hoped that everyone would work together to seek countermeasures and quickly suppress prices to benefit the people. Then, Zhao Zhangji and other representatives of the rice industry reported the reasons for the price increase. Subsequently, it was decided that the highest price should not exceed 54,000 yuan. After the discussion, Wang summarized the conclusions and drafted a telegram, which he sent to Premier Song that night for approval. Regarding the issue of land tax collection, Wang also instructed Magistrate Xu to collect all taxes before December 15 and not to delay. Wang left Wuxi for Suzhou at 2:00 a.m. the next morning.

### Wuxi Restricts Grain Prices

[Wuxi Report] Rice and grain prices in Wuxi have recently skyrocketed. Chief of Staff Liu of the city defense department dispatched officers to thoroughly investigate the rice, grain, and flour markets. At 2:00 p.m. yesterday, he summoned Zhao Zhangji and Zhang Yizhong, responsible persons from the rice and grain industry, and Guo Jiliang, from the flour industry, to discuss the issue of price suppression in the auditorium of the headquarters. The responsible persons of the Rice and Grain Industry Association reported that the current goods were all from visiting merchants, and there were no local goods on the market. The current inferior goods only cost 42,000 to 43,000 yuan per stone. The talk of high rice prices was about the once high price of broken japonica rice, which reached 70,000 yuan. However, there was very little of this good, with a price but no rice. As Wuxi is a distribution center for rice and grain, if there are too many arrivals and few buyers, the price will be cheap. It is entirely a matter of supply and demand. The responsible person of the flour industry said that it would be best to summon representatives from various factories to discuss. However, according to the raw material price of 40,000 yuan, the flour price must be 16,000 hundred yuan. The factories are currently requesting that the allocation of raw materials continue in order to further reduce the flour price. Finally, after detailed discussions, it was decided that each rice and grain merchant could only store 300 bags of rice and 600 ancestors of raw materials. The price of indica rice should not exceed 40,000 yuan, the price of japonica rice should not exceed 54,000 yuan, the price of flour should not exceed 16,000 yuan, and the price of period flour should not exceed 17,000 yuan.

### No Other Suffering in Rural Areas, but Bandit Disturbances are Unbearable

Suzhou County Magistrate Talks About His Inspection Tour

[Suzhou Report] Magistrate Da Jianhua of this county, in order to cooperate with the development of the bandit suppression work in the Yangcheng area, personally led the chief of the military affairs section, the captain of the security team, and other local forces to inspect the various rural areas under the jurisdiction of the Yangcheng area on the 1st, including Huangdai, Xiangcheng, Nanbeiqiao, and Shiqiao. He returned to Suzhou on the evening of the 4th. This reporter visited his private residence at 6:00 p.m. on the 5th to ask about his impressions of this trip. He said: "The mission of this trip was to go deep into the rural areas to comfort the people in order to facilitate the promotion of bandit suppression work. Every time I went to a place, I would gather the local elders and hold talks with them. I asked them how the rural areas are suffering today. I was told that apart from bandit disturbances and concerns about public security, there is no other suffering. This is something that can be told to those who care about rural areas. As for the grassroots politics, as far as our inspections have reached, it is quite clear. However, I deeply feel that it is difficult to establish a sound personnel system below the township level. The reason is that the Bao-Jia chiefs have only obligations and no rights. In the future, the township heads should strengthen the propaganda work so that all people will know the importance of participating in the Bao-Jia system. When passing near Huangdai, a military affairs section chief of the New Fourth Army's pseudo-Wuxi County Magistrate Cao Jianping's unit was captured. The government intends to influence and appease Cao's unit. After the Double Tenth Festival, it was decided to inspect the various rural areas under the jurisdiction of Taihu Lake, such as the East and West Dongting Mountains, Guangfu, Mu Du, and Jinshan, and to agree with the county magistrates of the neighboring counties of Wujiang and Wuxi to meet on the border to promote comfort work."

### Suzhou Public Education Personnel Benefits Adjusted and Supplemented

[Zhenjiang Report] The benefits for public education personnel in this province were previously adjusted by district starting in August, according to an order from the Executive Yuan. In the Zhenjiang, Changzhou, Wuxi, and Suzhou districts, the basic amount was 90,000 yuan, and the salary increase was 540 times. In the Jiangsu district, the basic amount was 75,000 yuan, and the salary increase was 440 times. At that time, due to the beginning of the fiscal reform and the provincial-level finance being in a period of transition, the provincial funds were extremely insufficient. However, the provincial-level public education personnel were living in unusually difficult conditions due to the high prices at this time. The Ministry of Finance first raised and disbursed the August adjustment amount in mid-September. Now, the Ministry of Finance, because October has already arrived, intends to raise and supplement the new benefit adjustment amounts for September and October in consideration of the difficulties of the public education personnel. It is currently expediting the signing of the allocation of funds and will be disbursed soon. The provincial-level agencies and schools in Nanjing and Shanghai have been approved by the Executive Yuan through the Provincial Government to follow the benefit standards of the Nanjing and Shanghai districts starting in August. All differences for August, September, and October will also be disbursed soon.

### Zhejiang Autumn Silkworm Harvest Not Exceeding 10,000 Loads

[Hangzhou Report] This year's autumn climate was hot and humid, which affected the growth of autumn silkworms, resulting in a sharp decrease in production. According to the person in charge of the Third District Silk Industry Association, it was previously estimated that the autumn silkworms could produce 25,000 loads, but in fact, the most this autumn will be no more than 10,000 loads. Therefore, only half of the 15 billion yuan in autumn silkworm loans were used. After discussion, the association decided to use the drinking fund to purchase spring cocoons self-baked by farmers.

### Northern Jiangsu Refugees Still in Dire Straits; Relief Donations Actually Embezzled; Suzhou Account Settlement Still Unresolved

[Suzhou Report] In order to relieve the refugees in northern Jiangsu, enthusiastic people in Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places have successively launched disaster relief organizations and promoted fundraising activities. Suzhou was not willing to lag behind and also organized a fundraising committee in August, jointly organized by local celebrities. They successively held dance, recreational, Kun opera, football, basketball, and other fundraising programs, and also ingeniously collected various fines to replenish the relief funds. For example, the Xiansheng Temple in Lumu violated the ban and held a temple fair in the city, and the city defense headquarters detained the organizers and fined them 2.5 million yuan before releasing them. Xi Bommin, the son of the pseudo-military official Zhong Guoliang, disturbed public order at the dance party and was fined 1 million yuan to settle the matter. Therefore, the fundraising results were not bad. According to the Zhenjiang Relief Association, Suzhou ranked second only to Shanghai among the cities on the Nanjing-Shanghai line, surpassing Nanjing, Wuxi, and other places. However, the exact amount of donations has been delayed in being announced. The media has repeatedly urged for the announcement, and the local people have also been discussing it, but the organizers have always remained silent and have not responded. It was not until the 19th of last month that news was suddenly revealed that an employee named Yu Changji had embezzled more than 6 million yuan in donations and fled without a trace. Therefore, all sectors of society believed that Yu Changji had no authority to handle money and unanimously and urgently demanded that the donation income and expenditure accounts be made public to clarify the truth. The association then appointed a review committee and scheduled a meeting for the 23rd to begin the review. However, the review work did not begin on the 23rd due to unsettled accounts. It was rescheduled for the 26th. The review work still did not begin on the 26th. Only 30 million yuan in donations were remitted first. All sectors of society temporarily shifted their focus because of this, and the news about the review work has since subsided, and it is feared that it will end without a conclusion.

[Bengbu Report] In the past two months, large and small stores here have been affected by the flood in northern Anhui. Credit is extremely tight, and it is difficult to sell goods. The market is becoming increasingly depressed, leading to closures and shutdowns. According to reliable sources, a total of 32 shops in the urban area closed in August, including six department stores such as Dongsheng Yuan, six cloth shops such as Shen Juheng, two oil and grain shops such as Lianxing Company, three sugar, paper, and sundries shops such as Jing Yixing Ji, five leather manufacturing factories such as Guanghua Factory, one hotel such as Liansheng Apartment, one tobacco factory such as Dacheng Tobacco Factory, one chicken and duck shop such as Chen Shunxin, six salt and grain shops such as Datongxing, and one hardware shop such as Shun Ji.

### Severe Losses, Difficult Recovery: Current State of the Electrical Industry in Jiangsu Province - Only 25 Power Generators are Operating

[Special Dispatch from Zhenjiang] Developing industry and revitalizing rural areas are the current priorities of the government's policies. Within this context, the driving force for developing industry and revitalizing rural areas is the electrical industry. However, what is the state of the electrical industry in Jiangsu? During the Anti-Japanese War, the extent of damage to all electrical enterprises was extremely severe. After the provincial government resumed operations, less than ten power plants across the province were struggling to generate electricity. Later, the Department of Reconstruction sent personnel to various locations to guide and rectify the businesses, circuits, and machinery. However, in terms of business, the rampant theft of electricity could not be eradicated, and many factories suffered from unsound personnel structures and excessive expenses. In terms of circuits, they were dilapidated from years of neglect, with losses accounting for 30% to 40% of the generated power, greatly impacting the future of the electrical industry. According to investigations by our Zhenjiang-based reporter, each kilowatt-hour of electricity requires two to three kilograms of coal, while the Songjiang Power Plant requires as much as 7.5 kilograms per kilowatt-hour, which is particularly uneconomical. However, due to the limited financial resources of local governments, none of the factories can carry out renovations according to standards. Currently, only 25 power plants within the province are operating normally, including the state-owned Qishuyan Power Plant. Furthermore, fuel is severely scarce, and various factories are frequently at risk of power outages. The provincial government is paying close attention and has contacted the Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs to purchase coal and coordinate the allocation of ships for transportation. The locations and names of power plants in the province that have resumed operations and those that have suspended operations, along with their power generation capacity and extent of damage, are investigated and listed below.

### Major Wuhan Swindle - Clearing of Creditors and Debts

[Hankou] The Wuhan Xianghe Lane 1.3 billion yuan swindle, which caused a sensation in Wuhan, after the ringleaders Wang Yifei, Wang Zhaomin, and Zhang Fengshi were each sentenced to seven years in prison by the local district court, is now being executed by the execution court.

### Meaning of Traffic Police Whistle

Since the reorganization of traffic order in the central district of this city, although not fully effective, it has already improved considerably. The most effective measures include designating one-way streets and prohibiting wide turns. These two things are the most practical needs and the most effective solutions. According to the situation in the past ten days, it is undeniable that considerable effort has been put into design and command. However, it is still felt that promotion is insufficient, because traffic order requires everyone to abide by it. Pedestrians, rickshaw pullers, tricycle pullers, and car drivers must all earnestly maintain order from themselves. But to achieve this effect, people of all kinds must first understand the traffic rules and the order of traffic, as well as the purpose of various facilities. I believe that the Public Works Bureau should compile concise booklets of traffic regulations, distribute them to every car driver and driver, and also distribute them to every citizen. It is also necessary to expand slogans.

I saw one thing in the central district. When the traffic lights at the intersection change, the police blow a whistle. As soon as the whistle blows, the vehicles start moving from a standstill. However, cars on the cross street can sometimes rush to the center of the intersection and stop next to the police. What is the reason for this? Although it is a small matter, it is worth discussing. In European and American cities, this traffic light control is not only red and green, but also a yellow one. Red means stop, green means go, and what about yellow? It means preparation. For example, during the red light, the vehicles stop, the vehicles moving are moving, and then red is followed by yellow. This is a preparation signal. Vehicles in motion must reduce speed in preparation for stopping, and vehicles at a standstill must prepare to move. When the yellow light goes off and the green light is displayed, the stopped vehicles move and the moving vehicles stop. After the green light goes out, it is still the yellow light, and after the yellow light, the red light is displayed. This method allows vehicles to have preparation time in terms of movement, so as to avoid the problems of not being able to stop in time or not being able to start immediately. In Shanghai, we only have red and green lights without a yellow light in between, which is already outdated. However, the police's intention to blow the whistle when changing the traffic lights is entirely to replace the function of this yellow light, but if it is blown inappropriately, this function will disappear. What should be done? The red light must not be changed during the time the whistle is blown. It must be blown completely, and immediately changed from red to green or from green to red. In other words, the whistle tells everyone a signal to prepare to go or prepare to stop. Not only must the police understand the purpose of blowing the whistle, but every vehicle driver must also understand its purpose. I think most people may not understand this small effect, so I specially bring it up.

There is another thing that is very strange. When pedestrians on the sidewalk cross the street, they should also abide by the instructions of the traffic lights and have the same actions as the vehicles in the same direction. Now pedestrians cross the street too arbitrarily. According to regulations, in major European and American cities, many places have pedestrian traffic lights. In cities without this equipment, pedestrians abide by the vehicle traffic lights. We must know that in the definition of "traffic category," pedestrians are also a type of traffic on the street and must also be included in traffic regulations.

The above sections are a small episode observed by the author recently. I think there are still many problems in maintaining traffic order in the central district. If it can be slowly and continuously improved, there will be good results. However, it is not enough if the municipal authorities are satisfied with this. (Yimin)

### General Assembly of the Peace Conference Discusses the Italian Treaty; U.S. Representative Connally Delivers Speech, Stating No Further Concessions on the Trieste Issue; Asks the Assembly to Adopt the Committee's Recommendations; Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov Returns to Paris from Moscow Yesterday

[Our Dispatch] Paris, 7th (Urgent Radio): Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov returned to Paris at 3:00 PM today, preparing to attend the plenary session of the Peace Conference.

[Our Dispatch] London, 7th (Radio): Under the chairmanship of Bevin, the plenary session of the Paris Peace Conference was held this afternoon (10:00 PM Shanghai time) to discuss the Italian Treaty. Three-quarters of the semi-circular seats were empty. Besides Chairman Bevin, Bales, Vishinsky, and Maureville were also present. The delegations believed that having representatives attend the committee meetings for consultations, there was no need for more than three or four representatives to attend the plenary session. U.S. Senator Connally delivered the first speech, stating to the representatives of the Peace Conference that the United States would make no further concessions on the Trieste issue, requesting the assembly to pass the committee proposal.

[United Press Paris, 7th] U.S. Senator Connally stated in his address to the representatives of the Peace Conference today that the proposed outline of the Free Territory of Trieste had been supported by two-thirds of the members of the Italian Political Committee. From the U.S. perspective, the Trieste agreement is a resolution and an agreement, and no part can be separated from the whole agreement. A fair resolution of the Trieste and Southern Italian border issues is key to the Peace Conference. The Free Territory of Trieste must be built on democratic principles and must be free and independent. The organization of the Free Territory must allow it to have a free life, free from external influence from any great power or group of great powers. Only the appointment of an administrative governor of the Free Territory by the Security Council can guarantee its integrity and independence. The administrative governor must have full power to fulfill these guarantees. He (the administrative governor) is not "the dictator some people claim," imposing his own or others' will on the residents. The administrative governor is responsible to the international body that maintains peace and security in the region."

Assembly Passes Agenda on First Day

[Reuters Paris, 6th] The plenary session of the Paris Peace Conference will begin the final stage of discussions tomorrow afternoon. At tonight's plenary session, chaired by Bevin, the procedural rules proposed by the Four Powers have been passed, so that the work of the Peace Conference can be concluded before October 15th. This method limits each representative to no more than thirty minutes of speaking time for each draft treaty. The draft Italian Treaty is scheduled for three days of discussion, and the remaining draft treaties for Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland will each be discussed for one day in turn. Each discussion will begin with a general discussion, followed by a vote on each clause and the committee's amendments. Tonight, the Soviet delegation proposed that the recommendations and opinions of each committee should be submitted to the Council of Foreign Ministers for review again, and this proposal was passed without opposition. Of the nine committees of the Peace Conference, only the Italian Economic Committee and the Military Committee were unable to conclude their work as scheduled on the 6th. The Military Committee completed its discussions this morning, while the Italian Economic Committee still needs to continue its meeting tonight.

### Unresolved Issues, Diplomatic War Reaches Climax, Bevin to Attend the United Nations General Assembly in Person

[United Press Paris, 7th] The Paris Peace Conference has failed to resolve various outstanding issues and is entering its final stage today. It is expected to extend the meeting until October 15th, but by then all hopes will be dashed, and the representatives of the twenty-one nations will inevitably come with high expectations and leave disappointed. Diplomatic war follows gun warfare and has reached its climax in the Peace Conference. The representatives of the Peace Conference began their plenary session at 3:00 PM today to determine the final general details of the draft treaty. The most difficult issues, namely the Southern Italian border dispute and the Trieste issue, will be discussed first. The latter will still be submitted to the Council of Foreign Ministers for discussion. As the Peace Conference is about to end, and the Four Powers Foreign Ministers prepare to reopen negotiations, the dispute between the East and West blocs remains unresolved, seemingly irreconcilable.

[Our Dispatch] Paris, 7th (London Radio): Regarding the rumor that the new Minister of State McNeil will lead the British delegation to the United Nations General Assembly on October 23rd, the British Foreign Office has not confirmed it. According to well-informed sources, Bevin will likely still preside in person, and Bevin is said to be very willing to meet with Egyptian Prime Minister Sidky in London, which can be accommodated between October 17th and 25th. Bevin has notified the Egyptian Ambassador in Cairo of this intention through the Chargé d'affaires. Therefore, Bevin may depart for the United States after that time.

### Rumor of Meeting Between the Three Giants; Location Possibly in Potsdam

[Central News Agency London, 6th (Special Dispatch)] According to the Sunday Express in Paris, discussions about a meeting between the three giants, Truman, Attlee, and Stalin, are currently underway in Paris. The meeting location is likely in the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany, possibly Potsdam.

### Interlude at the Peace Conference; Loudspeaker Sounds Like a Bugle; Translator Absent-Minded

[Agence France-Presse Paris, 6th] At the plenary session on the first day of the Peace Conference, attendance by representatives from various countries was not enthusiastic. To the right of Chairman Bevin was the U.S. delegation, and to the left was the head of the Greek delegation, Prime Minister Tsaldaris, and other members. Only a small number of representatives from other countries attended. After passing the fifth item on the agenda, the loudspeaker suddenly broke down, sounding like a bugle. In addition, there was an extremely amusing incident. A certain translator, being absent-minded, translated the speech delivered by Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vishinsky in English into Russian, causing great laughter among the representatives of various countries, and Vishinsky himself was doubled over with laughter.

### Riots by Italians in Trieste

[Reuters Trieste, 6th] After obtaining the consent of the Allied Military Government, Tito's regime held a harvest festival here, which was suddenly attacked by many anti-Tito Italians who threw smoke bombs, etc. Several of the latter were captured by the military.

### Atomic Bomb Transported to England; England Firmly Denies

### U.S. Army Air Transport; Reorganization Underway; Air Transport School Announces

[United Press Washington, 6th] According to an announcement today by the U.S. Army Air Transport School in Milloran: The United States is earnestly planning to make the entire army transportable by air. Artillery equipment is being redesigned to make it suitable for air transport, and larger transport aircraft will be designed and manufactured to better suit the needs of artillery units. Another type of C47 giant aircraft with a load capacity of 25 tons, and another with a load capacity of 50 tons, will be used to replace the C54 model.

### Hull's Condition Unchanged

[United Press Washington, 6th] Former Secretary of State Hull, at the age of 75, suddenly suffered a stroke on October 3rd, and was once in critical condition. Yesterday, there was an improvement, but he remains in serious condition. According to the hospital, Hull was able to sleep peacefully last night, and his condition is unchanged.

### Jews Launch Large-Scale Immigration Plan in Palestine; British Troop Movements Said to Be Unrelated; Truman Declaration Causes Arab Dissatisfaction

[Our Dispatch] London, 7th (Radio): President Truman's recent call to allow European Jewish immigrants to enter Palestine has immediately aroused opposition from the Arab side, which issued a warning that if Truman insists on implementing it, the United States' policies in various parts of the Arab world will undoubtedly fail.

[Reuters Jerusalem, 7th] Jewish groups began yesterday to launch a large-scale immigration plan in the Negev region of southern Palestine (i.e., the area between Hebron and the Sinai Peninsula, a military strategic location reserved by the British Morrison Plan). The Palestinian government is considering how to respond. It is reported that the Jews plan to establish twelve Jewish residential areas there. Many trucks carrying construction materials are traveling back and forth, and workers are working tirelessly from sunrise to sunset. A spokesman for the Jewish Association said that this plan is completely legal. These twelve villages are being built on 25,000 acres of land owned by the Jewish National Fund. The three experimental villages there, after adopting a scientific rotation planting method, can produce 150 kilograms per quarter acre, several times more than the 25 kilograms produced on Arab land.

The British military headquarters officially denied today that the movement of troops in southern Palestine was related to the Jewish immigration plan in the Negev region.

[Central News Agency London, 5th (Special Dispatch)] It is reported that Prime Minister Attlee has made a serious "protest" to President Truman this morning and reiterated Britain's attitude on the entire Palestine issue. It is expected that when the British Parliament reconvenes on the 8th after the summer recess, Prime Minister Attlee will make a statement in the House of Commons.

[United Press Baghdad, 6th] Iraqi Prime Minister Umari today refuted U.S. President Truman's statement advocating continued Jewish immigration to Palestine in strong terms, and called on all Arab nations to rise up in opposition. Umari has telegraphed the King of Saudi Arabia and the King of Yemen, as well as the Prime Ministers of Egypt, Syria, and Lebanon, informing them of this intention.

### After Execution of German War Criminals, to be Buried in Unmarked Graves; Location Secret to Prevent Body Theft

[United Press Philadelphia, 7th] Dr. Kapner, who assisted in the prosecution of the eleven Nazi war criminals sentenced to death by the Nuremberg International Tribunal, said today that after the execution of each criminal, they will be buried in an unmarked grave at an undisclosed location. The court wants to make it clear to the world that these warlords are also ordinary criminals, so they plan to hang them instead of shooting them. The burial place of these people will be kept secret, and there will be no tombstones on the graves, to prevent still-undead Nazis from visiting the graves. The court will be responsible for preventing incidents such as the theft of Mussolini's body from happening.

### Göring and Wife's Farewell; Letering Receives Death Sentence; Schacht Leaves Nuremberg

[Our Dispatch] Paris, 7th (Nuremberg Radio): Göring's wife bid farewell to her husband this afternoon between 2:30 and 3:30 PM. The wives of the other war criminals also received the same permission, but only Göring's wife took advantage of the opportunity.

[Agence France-Presse Nuremberg, 7th] One of the German war criminals, namely the former Governor of the occupied area of the Netherlands, Gu Kade, has been sentenced to death. The criminal has now written to the Queen of the Netherlands, asking her to intercede with the Four-Power Control Council in Berlin. The letter states that during his tenure as Governor, he spared the Dutch people all kinds of suffering and took various humanitarian steps to benefit the Dutch people greatly.

[Reuters Nuremberg, 7th] While reviewing his personal documents in prison, Göring found a photo of his wife. After staring at it for a moment, he tore it up in anger, shredding it into pieces and throwing it into the wastepaper basket. Another defendant sentenced to death, Ying Jiade, has appealed to Queen Wilhelmina of Holland, claiming to be the savior of the Dutch people, and has tried to alleviate the suffering of the Dutch people in the darkest times.

[United Press Nuremberg, 7th] Former German Naval Commander Leiter today appealed to the Four-Power Control Council to change his life sentence to death by firing squad, saying that this appeal is not an admission of guilt, but because he is 70 years old, physically weak, and will not be in prison for long. Schacht left Nuremberg to visit friends and relatives in "the suburbs of Stuttgart." The military government stated that Schacht has completed the procedures with the military government and the German police. Fritz is currently living in a friend's house in Nuremberg; Papen remains in prison, awaiting a permit from the British-occupied zone to return to his residence in Stockhausen.

### Hess Applies for Amnesty, Offering Two Reasons

[Reuters Hamburg, 6th] British news agency said: Hess's defense counsel is applying to the Allied Control Council for amnesty based on the following points: (1) Hess is the only defendant sentenced for only the first and second counts listed in the indictment, namely conspiracy and crimes against peace. (2) The Soviet Union at least cannot recognize Germany's policy as a crime, because the Soviet Union also shared the results of Germany's victory, such as the partition of Poland, Bessarabia, etc., and also invaded Finland.

### Germans Used by Others, Large Demonstration in Berlin

[Reuters Berlin, 6th] There was a demonstration of "victims of fascism" in Wilhelm Square in the Soviet zone of Berlin today, protesting the leniency of the Nuremberg Tribunal's sentences. The demonstrators also demanded that the Nazi movement be purged throughout Germany. Wei Boli Te, one of the leaders of the German Communist Party, claimed that only one-third of Germany is free of fascist forces. Jewish representative Meyer said that the Nuremberg verdict is enough to encourage the resurgence of reactionaries, and it should be unanimously decided to demand that the three released criminals be tried by a court organized solely by Germans. The Social Democratic Party originally planned to participate in today's demonstration, but temporarily withdrew because the demonstration was a Communist propaganda campaign.

### Government Should Take Strict Measures Against U.S. Communist Party Commanded by the Soviet Union; Congressman Thomas Writes to Inspector General

[United Press Washington, 6th] U.S. Congressman Thomas today called on the U.S. government to take strict measures against the Communist Party, which is active in the United States and commanded by Moscow. In a letter to U.S. Attorney General Clark, he said: "I dare to ask you to immediately stop the activities of this force that is constantly trying to undermine the government." If the Republican Party gains control of the House of Representatives in the upcoming election, Thomas will become the chairman of the Anti-American Activities Investigation Committee. He told Clark that the following reasons make the Communist Party subject to indictment: (1) The party is controlled by a foreign government and should register with the Inspector General; (2) Although there are regulations that require persons related to foreign countries to register with the State Department, none of the Communist Party members have registered; (3) The Communist Party and others have not complied with the Federal "Corrupt Practices Act" in the past and submitted reports on their campaign expenses to the Senate and House of Representatives; (4) The "Daily Worker" newspaper and the "New Masses" and other official Communist Party publications enjoy second-class mailing privileges, which is a clear violation of postal laws, as it stipulates that mail shall not be used as a propaganda tool; (5) The Communist Party conducts work under the cover of a "front organization" network without paying income tax, as they call themselves charitable organizations or patriotic groups. Thomas pointed out that the Canadian Royal Commission recently found in its report that espionage activities in the country are related to similar activities in the United States. He hopes that a similar trial can be held in the United States soon.

### Indo-Dutch Negotiations Resumed Yesterday; Both Sides Express Optimism

[United Press Batavia, 7th] Negotiations between the Dutch government and the East Indies government, which have been suspended for more than three months, resumed today. Dutch Commissioner Van Mook and East Indies Prime Minister Sjahrir both expressed optimism, saying that the resolution of the 14-month-long East Indies conflict is not far off.

[United Press London, 6th] The Times today published a dispatch from Java stating that the Dutch attitude towards resolving the East Indies issue has improved, and it is now believed that the East Indian national movement is genuine and not comparable to those left over from the Japanese occupation era who only intended to cause trouble. However, the East Indian side should also increase its understanding of the value of Dutch assistance and cooperation. Dutch representative Van Mook, East Indies Prime Minister Sjahrir, and British Commissioner for Southeast Asia Killian have decided today on the final arrangements for the formal resumption of political negotiations tomorrow. The first negotiation will be held at the British Consulate General in Batavia, chaired by Killian.

### Japanese House of Representatives Passes New Draft Constitution

[Central News Agency Tokyo, 7th] The Japanese House of Representatives today passed the draft constitution, stipulating that the Japanese Emperor Hirohito is only a head of state without power and abandons war as the supreme power of the state.

### Thousands of Meteors Will Fly Through Space Tonight; Astronomers Say Rare in History

[United Press Brekke, Massachusetts, 7th] Harvard University astronomers predict that thousands of meteors will fly through space tomorrow night, like fireworks in the sky, so they have prepared telescopes to enjoy the spectacle. According to the university's observatory, this meteor shower will continue for three days, ending on Thursday night. The scale will be unprecedented in astronomical history. At that time, people in the eastern United States will have the clearest view. This phenomenon is caused by the Earth approaching the orbit of the Giacobini-Zinner comet. The original distance between the Earth and the Moon is about 238,000 miles, but during these three days, the distance will only be 131,000 miles.

### Nehru Reprimands Churchill, Demands Quick Withdrawal of British Troops; Nehru and Jinnah Hold Second Meeting

[Our Dispatch] London, 7th (Radio): Nehru and Jinnah held a second meeting today lasting 75 minutes. According to Gandhi, the Indian League now has the possibility of participating in the interim government.

[Agence France-Presse New Delhi, 7th] British Conservative Party leader, former Prime Minister Churchill, made a speech yesterday at the party's annual meeting that was unfavorable to India. Nehru, Chairman of the Indian Interim Government, issued a statement today strongly refuting it. He said: A portion of the leading figures in the British Conservative Party have always adopted a hostile attitude towards us. Churchill's remarks were irresponsible, full of malice, and aimed at inciting disputes and preventing the unification of India. We demand the immediate withdrawal of British troops from India, or at least a very rapid withdrawal. This is our consistent policy, before and after taking office. We do not want to see British troops stay in India for another day. We will never cooperate with those who adopt an unfriendly attitude or hinder Indian independence. They should fully understand this.

### Scientific Fishing; Japanese Professor Invents New Method

### Fire in Karimun, Heavy Losses for Overseas Chinese

[Central News Agency Singapore, 7th (Special Dispatch)] A fire broke out on Karimun Island (30 nautical miles southwest of Singapore, one of the Dutch islands) last night, and it took four hours to extinguish, leaving more than 1,000 overseas Chinese on the island homeless. All 300 overseas Chinese shops in the area were burned to the ground, with a total property loss estimated at 10 million Straits dollars, but fortunately there were no casualties.

### Turkish President and Prime Minister Visit Various Border Regions; Ambassadors to the United States and Soviet Union to be Reappointed

[United Press Istanbul, 7th] The Turkish President and Prime Minister traveled separately today. The Turkish government is said to be finalizing its reply to the Soviet Union's second request for joint control of the Dardanelles Strait. President Inonu suddenly left the capital today to inspect southern Turkey. According to a dispatch from Adana: The President has gone to Xin City on the Aegean Sea. Prime Minister Bayer, in the capacity of Minister of National Defense, has gone to the Serres region, which borders Turkey and Bulgaria. A large army has gathered there, and there were rumors a week ago that the Soviet Union was operating along the Turkish border.

[Reuters London, 6th] Ankara Radio said: The Turkish ambassadors to the United States and the Soviet Union will be reappointed. The former ambassador to the Vichy government in France will be transferred to the United States, and Member of Parliament Abdul will serve as the Turkish ambassador to the Soviet Union.

### The Arctic Can Be Used as a Transportation Route: American Superfortress' Non-Stop Test Flight Proved; General Spaatz Issues Commentary

[United Press Cairo, 6th] The US Army's Superfortress "Dream Boat" departed from Honolulu, flew non-stop over the Arctic to Cairo, lasting 39 hours and 35 minutes, and safely arrived at the airport outside this city. The entire journey was 9,500 miles, with a starting load of 29,500 pounds. Captain Irvine and his nine crew members were exhausted upon disembarking. According to Irvine, this flight proved that the Superfortress can defend America in any part of the world. Arctic transportation can be developed, and highly skilled pilots can fly, taking the Arctic as

A shortcut for global flight

The Dream Boat had no de-icing equipment in order to carry more fuel, so it had to fly above 4 miles to avoid encountering freezing weather along the way. High-altitude flight consumes a lot of fuel. When it landed, there were only 400 gallons of gasoline left, barely enough to wet the bottom of the thirty-six fuel tanks. Each tank can hold 13,000 gallons when full. According to Helmsman Major Hayes, the Dream Boat's speed was 250 miles per hour, breaking the aircraft's previous record of 234 miles per hour from Guam to Washington, but it did not break the Navy's "Fury" aircraft's non-stop flight record of 11,236 miles from Perth to Seattle days ago.

Hayes led the Dream Boat entirely relying on a six-pound radio compass, as the aircraft was flying in dense shade, with no sky above and no ground below. Most of the flight was above the clouds to avoid icing. One of the most difficult sections was between Baffin Island and Iceland, where the Dream Boat ascended to 22,000 feet, but still could not completely escape the freezing climate.

[Reuters London, 6th] The US Army's Superfortress "Dream Boat" flew 16,480 kilometers from Hawaii over the Arctic to Cairo. Captain Owen stated that the Arctic

The actual location of the magnetic pole

is 320 kilometers further north than shown on current Arctic maps, which is the same as what British astronomer Sir Jones claimed today. Canadian scientists believe that the Arctic underground may contain large amounts of magnetic material, so high-altitude tests can be more accurate.

[Agence France-Presse Washington, 6th] Regarding the successful attempt by American pilot Captain Irvine to fly the "Dream Boat" Superfortress directly from Honolulu to Cairo, British Air Force Commander-in-Chief

General Spaatz Commented

that this is sufficient to prove that industrial countries and countries manufacturing atomic bombs are all within the range of atomic bomb attacks. At the same time, it is also known that this type of Superfortress can carry ten tons of bombs, fly in the Arctic, and bomb areas north of 40 degrees north latitude.

[United Press Washington, 6th] Air Force Commander Spaatz issued his opinion today on the successful Arctic flight of the Superfortress Dream Boat, saying: This proves that well-equipped aircraft can fly over the Arctic, and collect valuable reports on various issues such as flight, engineering, transportation, climate, gasoline consumption, and hunger endurance. However, this is purely a scientific experiment, and the aircraft has no combat equipment. The aircraft used in this experiment is relatively old. Other bombers have much larger size, capacity, and flying distance than this aircraft, and are being prototyped or have already been built. This type of aircraft, such as the Dream Boat and the Angry Turtle, can generally fly around the globe, with spare space to carry bombs.

[Associated Press Washington, 6th] Senior American military experts believe that the Army's B-29's successful flight over the Arctic has finally proved that the United States is indeed vulnerable to attacks from the north. Army Department officials strongly stated that Secretary Patterson's main intention in requesting the United States to implement compulsory military training is to establish a people's army to cope with invaders coming from the air.

### The City Council's Various Committees Held Their First Meetings Yesterday; Chairpersons of Each Committee Were Elected Respectively

[Report from Our Newspaper] The City Council held its first subcommittee meetings yesterday afternoon at the City Chamber of Commerce on the second floor of the Tianhou Palace Bridge, divided into eleven groups. The main item of the meeting was the election of three chairpersons for each group. The election method was based on four principles: (1) Each group should have three chairpersons. (2) The election of chairpersons for each group should be by anonymous ballot. (3) The type of committee should be written by the voters themselves on the ballot. (4) Voters should mainly choose committees they are interested in. The ballots were counted on the spot after voting.

The meeting started at 9:00 AM with the five committees for Autonomy, Finance, Land Administration, Education, and Society. At 3:00 PM, the six committees for Police Affairs, Public Works, Public Utilities, Health, Budget and Final Accounts, and Laws and Regulations held their meetings. Speaker Gong Zhan and Xu Changji personally attended and presided over the meetings. The election results were: (1) Autonomy: Chen Baotai, Zhu Wende, Xia. (2) Finance: Zhao Dihua, Shen Ding, Wang Yansong. (3) Land Administration: Wang Xianqing, Lu Shidao, Wang Wei. (4) Education: Tong Xingbai, Zhou Feicheng, Xu Ze.

(11) Wu Zhengying, Zhu Juejiu, Ma Junshuo.

Yesterday, some committees adjourned after electing chairpersons because they had no proposals for discussion. The rest submitted temporary motions to the subcommittee for discussion.

### The Film and Theater Industries Submit Additional Reasons Requesting a Reduction in Entertainment Tax, Guaranteeing 1.8 Billion in Tax Payments for October

When the Second Finance Group submitted the proposal to review the Film and Theater Industry Association's request for a reduction in the entertainment tax rate due to it being too high, Speaker Pan personally attended to explain the film and theater industry's demands, stating that the two industry associations proposed two points: (1) The industry had no reason to oppose the City Council's resolution to increase the entertainment tax by 10%. (2) The previous entertainment tax of 50% included 20% for the defense corps' clothing expenses. Now that the City Council has decided to cancel the defense corps' clothing expenses, the 20% should be canceled immediately. If the 10% increase is added to the original 30%, the tax should be 40% (as previously levied). The industry association is willing to guarantee to the Municipal Finance Bureau that it will pay 1.8 billion yuan in taxes in October. If there is a shortfall, it will be apportioned by each theater. This case was resolved to be retained and submitted for discussion at the next meeting. The group also resolved that all future proposals should be printed and distributed three days in advance for thorough study. The next meeting is tentatively scheduled for 3:00 PM on the 21st of this month (Monday) at the Bank of Communications on the third floor.

The Tenth Budget and Final Accounts Group discussed two cases: (1) Councilor Zhao Yangxiong's proposal for the New Life Movement Promotion Association's publicity expenses was resolved to be submitted to the general meeting for discussion based on Councilor Li Wenjie's calculation. That is, the New Life Movement's request to include 5 million yuan in monthly operating expenses in the budget, requesting four months first, is proposed to allocate 20 million yuan. The proposed establishment fee of 20 million yuan for the demonstration area is proposed to be calculated at 85%, which is 17 million yuan. The total should be an additional 37 million yuan. (2) The Health Bureau's submission of additional budget books for increasing the number of civilian clinics was sent directly to the Council, which did not comply with the procedure. The bureau should submit it to the Municipal Government for transfer to the Council for review. The group decided that the next meeting would be held from 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM on the 23rd, and the location would be determined separately.

### Relieving Hidden Poverty, Solving the Housing Shortage

The Fifth Social Committee discussed temporary motions: (1) It is proposed that the Municipal Government forward to the Central Government a plan for providing assistance to hidden poverty nationwide and application methods. The proposers and seconders of the case reached 82 people. It was resolved to send it to the Municipal Government for reference, with the application method for hidden poverty attached as a reference. (2) The housing shortage in the city is serious. Effective measures should be determined and strictly implemented, and the implementation method should be actively promoted and revised before being passed. (3) Many of the resolutions on labor movement submitted by the Temporary Council have not been implemented. Please implement them promptly. After review, please implement them promptly. (4) Strengthen the review of drama, singing, and radio broadcasting work to correct social atmosphere. After review, it was resolved to retain it for discussion at the next meeting.

### Dredging Rivers

When the Seventh Public Works Group held a meeting, Director Zhao Zukang of the Public Works Bureau personally participated and explained various issues. The group's discussion yesterday resulted in the determination that the Second-Class main rivers that should be urgently repaired are Rihui Port and Zoumatang (both rivers are currently under construction). The First-Class tributary rivers that should be dredged first are Shajing Port, Taoshupu, Dousupu, and Majiabang. The total cost for dredging the above six rivers is 290 million yuan, of which 80 million yuan has been included in the budget. Manpower should also be included in the other 210 million yuan. According to the Shanghai River Dredging Regulations, the dredging expenses for First and Second-Class rivers are entirely borne by the beneficiary areas, but in special circumstances, a request can be submitted to the Public Works Bureau to transfer it to the Municipal Government for allocation of subsidies. The amount of subsidies shall not exceed 40% of the total dredging expenses of each river.

The Ninth Health Group's discussion resulted in a proposal to divide into groups to investigate the Health Bureau's implementation of health conditions. Ms. Tang Guifen is responsible for investigating factory health aspects. The focus of the group's discussions in the future is planned to be on the health conditions of schools and factories.

### Rebuilding Destroyed School Buildings

The Fourth Education Group passed a temporary motion after revising the method, requesting the Municipal Government to rebuild the buildings of all municipal primary and secondary schools destroyed during the war. All construction costs should be included in the budget for the 36th year.

The Sixth Police Affairs Group passed a temporary motion proposing that the Municipal Government strengthen drug prohibition and burn the seized drugs on a monthly basis to prevent abuses.

The Eleventh Laws and Regulations Group discussed a temporary motion proposing that the relevant departments and courts of the Central Government formulate regulations for the organization of employees in various industries. After review, this case was retained for discussion at the next meeting at the City Council at 3:00 PM on the 21st of this month. At the same time, the Municipal Government is requested to send all regulations to the subcommittee for review first.

### Hanging the National Flag, Passing a Uniform Method

The First Autonomy Group passed a resolution "regarding the organization of hanging the national flag in this city, it should be in accordance with the regulations of the National Government to list the flag-raising dates, raising and lowering times, ceremonies, and the angle and dates of half-mast flags, and issue them to each household or group, in order to achieve uniformity and grandeur."

In addition, the Third Land Administration Group and the Eighth Public Utilities Group adjourned after electing chairpersons because there were no motions for discussion.

The Secretariat will organize and schedule the dates, times, and locations of the next meetings of each group, and will notify them later.

### The Municipal Party Headquarters' Memorial Week, Fang Zhi Encourages Comrades

After performing the ceremony, Fang Zhi first praised the former Director Wu Shaoshu for his hard work in Shanghai, and then spoke about the future direction of the Shanghai party affairs work, and put forward three points to encourage all comrades of the headquarters and the various district party branches: (1) Restrain material enjoyment, pay attention to spiritual cultivation, transform the environment, shift the declining trend, and establish a new atmosphere. (2) Should work hard, be practical and seek to achieve things, do not perfunctorily follow the old ways to deceive and cover things up, in order to complete the work. Afterwards, Fang Zhi introduced the new Secretary-General Xie Renzhao, and members Wu Kaixian, Zhang Xiaosong, Tao Baichuan, Xu Mingya, etc. to the comrades. The ceremony ended at half past ten.

Also reported: The Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters has already designated Tao Baichuan as the Director of the Propaganda Department and Chen Baotai as the Director of the Organization and Training Department. The two have scheduled to go to work within the day.

### The Shanghai Investigation Work Concludes; Wu Wangji Talks About His Impressions Before Leaving; Not Focused on Negative Investigation, But on Active Application; Methods Should Be Found Quickly to Settle Matters After the Investigation

Investigator Wu Wangji of the Investigation Team is rushing to handle the investigation work in Zhejiang Province. He went to Hangzhou last night with Chairman Shen of the Zhejiang Provincial Government. When the reporter asked Wu about his impressions of the investigation in Shanghai before his departure, Wu said that the Investigation Team's organization was simple and the time was too short, and he regretted that he was unable to carry out a thorough investigation to complete the task satisfactorily. He also said that there was no precedent for receiving and handling enemy and puppet materials, and it was inevitable that it was chaotic and messy, especially the large amount of materials and the complexity of the situation in Shanghai. As far as he could see, he believed that the most abuses arose from the military and civilians taking advantage of the chaos during the initial period of the enemy's surrender and the military chaos. However, this was understandable during the military transition period. After the arrival of the central personnel in Shanghai and the formal establishment of the Municipal Government and the Garrison Command, there were still many irregular and illegal receiving cases or improper handling incidents due to the complexity of the receiving personnel in Shanghai, which was regrettable.

Since the establishment of the Handling Bureau, the management of enemy and puppet materials has begun to be standardized. However, the bureau is a temporary institution and the staff is inevitably uneven. The handling of cases is often delayed. Also, due to the large size of the institution, abuses follow. Or because of different opinions on handling cases, disputes arise frequently, causing many social repercussions. In all fairness, the handling of complex enemy and puppet property was originally a difficult task. The bureau handled more than 3,000 cases in less than a year, increasing the national treasury's revenue by 300 billion yuan, which is a commendable effort. However, whether the handling policies and principles are appropriate, legal, and reasonable is another question. In the negative aspect, although the Investigation Team failed to fully investigate the dereliction of duty, corruption, or embezzlement of officials involved in receiving and handling, in the positive aspect, it made the people aware that the central government attached importance to this work, giving a serious blow to those who took advantage of their power and position to seize and occupy enemy and puppet materials. After the arrival of the Investigation Team in Shanghai, this group of evildoers has gradually disappeared. It is estimated that the discovery of hidden materials or occupied materials and the increase in the national treasury's revenue will be over 10 billion yuan, which is also a considerable gain. Today, the problem is no longer in the negative investigation and handling of corruption, but in the active application. The enemy's remaining materials, such as the large amount of cotton yarn, cloth, and daily necessities stored in various warehouses, should be auctioned off quickly to clear the warehouses. How to equip the troops with military equipment and old military supplies, even shell casings and scrap iron, or have them recovered by ordnance factories. How to accelerate the resumption of work in the factories received by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, even if the people are unable to buy the factories, the government should also lease them or have them exclusively operated by various industries without conditions, so as to use them as soon as possible and restore production to save the current decline. The earliest possible settlement of the sealing of houses and small shops and the occupied houses and properties is also the most important plan. It must be known that after the investigation, there must be a settlement. The investigation has revealed the abuses of enemy and puppet materials. In order to prescribe the right medicine, the central competent authorities must find a way to settle matters, and then the reception and handling of enemy and puppet materials can be concluded as soon as possible. The Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau is a temporary institution. It is hoped that local governments and legal entities will prepare as soon as possible so that the settlement work can be more effective.

### Thirty-Two Couples Have Already Participated in the Double Tenth Group Wedding

[Report from Our Newspaper] The third group wedding organized by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau is being prepared by the Fourth Division, and everything is now in place.

### Canadian Ambassador General Odlum Discusses the Chinese Situation at Length; Received Reporters Yesterday and Left Shanghai for His Home Country on the Same Day

Canadian Ambassador to China General Odlum held a press conference in Shanghai yesterday morning, imparting farewell words, and offered many pertinent criticisms of today's China. Odlum engaged in journalism in his early years, came to China in 1942 to take office, and made many contributions to promoting Sino-Canadian diplomatic relations and trade between the two countries. He has also achieved great success in carefully studying the actual situation in our country for the past two or three years. This time he was summoned to return to his country to report on his work. It has not yet been decided when he will come to China again. Odlum first promoted the precious friendship between China and Canada, and said:

The signing of the Sino-Canadian trade agreement will depend on the progress of the Sino-US trade agreement, but he can assert that once the Sino-Canadian trade agreement is signed, its scope will be extremely broad and meaningful. Talking about the current situation in China, Odlum believes that writing peace is of no practical use. We must meet each other with sincerity and cooperate wholeheartedly to achieve true peace. Signing agreements on paper is of no help to peace. However, General Odlum emphasized one point. He believes that China has its weaknesses, but it also has many strengths. Outsiders only know China's corruption, greed, and darkness, but the Chinese people are a nation with a hard-working spirit and the patience to struggle and strengthen themselves. After he returns to his country, he will tell the Canadians what he has seen, heard, researched, and learned in China over the past three years, so that they can understand China's various difficulties and problems.

The Chinese people deserve admiration in three ways: first, their hard work and endurance, second, the progress of the education sector in recent years, and third, the superb skills of Chinese handicrafts, which will be a major export in the future. When asked for his opinion on the future of democratic politics in China, Odlum said: Most of the Chinese people, whether they understand democracy or not, eagerly await democratic politics and are developing in this direction. Democratic politics is not without any weaknesses. Western democratic countries are also prone to errors, but one thing can be guaranteed, that is, democratic countries never launch aggression. Therefore, all Western freedom-loving and democratic countries hope that China will achieve peace and realize democracy as soon as possible, which will be of great benefit to the future peace of the world. He believes that to study China, one should start with China's leaders. After three years of dedicated research, he admits that he has a understanding of China's four major political parties, but refuses to make any criticism, only believing that they are quite similar to Canadian political parties. When asked whether China's current situation may cause the third

World War, Odlum believes that this is not possible, but once World War III unfortunately breaks out, China will occupy an important position. As for Odlum himself, he is slightly pessimistic about the peace of the world today. Finally, when talking about Canada's foreign policy, Odlum humbly stated that Canada is a newly emerging country, deeply assisted by the United Kingdom and the United States. As a member of the world's democratic countries, he will naturally work hard for democracy. The purpose of his mission to China this time is to establish good contacts with China and strengthen the interests of both countries. He finally stated that these three years in China were the most meaningful period of his life.

Also reported: General Odlum has already left China by plane from Shanghai yesterday afternoon to return to Canada.

### Fang Fushu Returns to Shanghai and Talks About the Diligence and Cunning of the Japanese, Which Should Serve as a Warning to Our People; Debauchery and the Enticement of Beauties

[Report from Our Newspaper] Fang Fushu, a Chinese judge who served as an aide to the Chinese judge, Qin Dechun, Vice Minister of National Defense, and the puppet emperor of Manchukuo, Puyi, when they testified at the Tokyo International Tribunal, recently returned to China from Japan. He told reporters yesterday about the recent situation in Japan: the general situation in defeated Japan is better than that in our victorious country.

Fang felt emotional about the chaos in the country and the stability of Japanese society. He said that although Japan cannot yet be said to be reviving and prosperous, the scars of the war have gradually healed. The burnt remains of major cities such as Tokyo and Yokohama have been cleared and swept away, and the city appearance has gradually returned to its former appearance. The Ginza area, which was once desolate, has also recovered its former prosperity.

Although the lives of the Japanese people are still difficult, they do not live in the turbulent waves of soaring prices like the citizens of Shanghai. In general, only clothing and transportation are relatively lacking. Although there is also a housing shortage, there is no phenomenon like in Shanghai where huge amounts of gold bars are being used to top prices. The black market exists, but it is not rampant. Although there are unemployed people, they are optimistic. They believe that due to the gradually developing reconstruction work, they will soon have employment opportunities. In general, the government has effective control, and the people abide by the law and obey, so even though the country has failed, there is hope, and even though the people are suffering, their lives are stable.

Fang continued: What is especially worthy of our people's warning is that Japan is a diligent and cunning nation, good at seizing opportunities. They know very well that their fate is now in the hands of the United States. They also know very well the United States' policy towards Japan under the current international situation. Therefore, they are increasingly showing their ability to cater to, flatter, and fawn upon the United States. At present, many of the US troops stationed in Japan have a sense of "being happy and forgetting their homeland," because the Japanese side is doing everything possible to provide all the comfortable and comfortable life and the enjoyment of debauchery, and serving them diligently in order to win the favor of the beauties.

As for the International Tribunal, since it started in May of this year, it is still in the stage of providing evidence from various countries. Then the defendants will defend themselves, and then the prosecutors will refute. The sentencing date will be in March or April of next year. For the charges against the war criminals, the evidence for the two crimes of atrocities and mistreatment of prisoners of war is relatively conclusive, but the two crimes of conspiracy and launching a war of aggression have some room for evasion in law. Fortunately, the precedent of the Nuremberg Tribunal's judgment on German war criminals can be used as a reference for future convictions.

### General Chennault Will Leave Shanghai for Beijing Today

Flying Tiger General Chennault is scheduled to leave Shanghai for Beijing by plane at 7:30 this morning. He will pay respects to Chairman Chiang and relevant authorities to discuss matters related to the Aviation Association. It is reported that Chen will stay at the Lizhi Society in Beijing.

### The Agricultural Association of China Will Hold Its Annual Meeting on the 9th

The Agricultural Association of China is scheduled to hold its eighth annual meeting at the Ningbo Fellow Association on Xizang Road in this city at 8:30 AM on October 9. It is also planned to invite people from all walks of life to attend the meeting and express their opinions on the future of agriculture for reference. A joint public banquet will be held by various agricultural institutions on the same day in the afternoon and evening.

### Mr. Xuan, the Commander, Replies to a Letter from Reporters

To the esteemed military correspondents of all newspapers:

Having read your letter published in yesterday's newspapers in this city, requesting my response, I hereby provide the following reply:

The Garrison Headquarters is an official institution and cannot accommodate visitors all day long. As a military organization, it must prioritize military confidentiality and cannot indiscriminately disclose information. Even for publishable news, secrecy is necessary before its official release. Therefore, I am determined to establish fixed times and locations for meetings, and news releases must not compromise military secrets. This is my duty to regulate internal affairs and my right to do so. There is no reason to obstruct our duties unless laws stipulate that "official institutions are subject to the control of news reporters."

To differentiate reporters from ordinary visitors, I have appointed Major General Yu Yong, a senior staff officer, to be responsible for receiving you, with designated meeting times from 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM and 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM, providing as much information as possible. To call this a "blockade" is to deny the special arrangement unfairly. If this does not allow complete freedom, the words of Madame Roland are most apt. Your requests for a press room at every location and a half-hour meeting with me each week are unnecessary, considering the limited news output of this headquarters, the insufficient personnel, and my inability to commit to a fixed schedule.

"The Garrison Headquarters will never shut its doors." Things remain as they were: you may enter, someone will announce your arrival, someone will guide you, and someone will engage in conversation. There has never been anyone turned away during designated meeting hours, nor any instance of guards being beaten with clubs. This alone is enough to demonstrate the necessity of accurate reporting. The Garrison Headquarters is a public institution, and its news releases are mostly reports of official business. We cannot fulfill your requests to create "fresh" stories. If you deem official reports unworthy of publication, we have no right to force your hand. However, please note this: you are free to gather news, and we are free to conduct official business. Fairness and mutual benefit are the principles to uphold. I have said all I need to say and hope there will be no need for a second response. Xuan Tiewu.

### Mayor's Inspection of the "Black Market": Three Arrested for Illegal Trading of US Dollars

[Our Report] Following the sharp rise in US dollar exchange rates last week, all money exchanges suspended trading for three days and resumed yesterday. The authorities temporarily set the market price of the US dollar at 3,500 yuan, and any trading exceeding this limit would be suppressed. However, yesterday at around 4:00 PM, some people were still engaged in black market trading of US dollars in the Sichuan Road and Central Road area, with substantial transactions. Mayor Wu, while inspecting the above locations, witnessed the situation and immediately telephoned the Huangpu Police Bureau. The branch director Du Chun, the deputy branch director Wang Xie Gong, accompanied by section chief Li Yin Min, and a number of police officers rushed to the scene and arrested the following people: Jewish man Lüt-Qiu Huangte (52 years old, residing at No. 96, Lane 818, Tangshan Road), Chinese man Chen Xihe (28 years old, residing at No. 7, Lane 359, Fujian Road), and Lin Shiqiu (24 years old, residing at No. 21, Yuanchang Lane, Yuanfang Road). Several hundred US dollar notes were confiscated and taken to the station. Branch Director Du personally conducted the interrogation, and after verifying the facts and taking statements, ordered their detention, scheduling their transfer to the Municipal Police Bureau this morning for strict legal proceedings.

### Minor Records of Election Conveners: The Budget Group Mutually Declines the Position of Chairman; the Police Affairs Group Decides by Lot

[Our Report] Yesterday, the City Council's various subcommittee held their first meeting since the general assembly adjourned. Because it was the first meeting, the results of the meeting did not involve concrete discussion. However, during the most important task of electing conveners, two small incidents occurred.

The first incident occurred in the tenth group, the Budget and Final Accounts Committee, which was electing three conveners. The work of budgeting and final accounting is arguably the most important task in the City Council, especially the "budget" part. All facilities for the four million citizens of Shanghai are financed by the municipal government. How much money does the municipal government need? What things should money be spent on? What things are unnecessary? Where should more money be spent? Where should less money be spent? All such "decisions" must be made by the City Council. However, the City Council has too many things to decide, and there is not enough time to study and discuss every detail. Of course, this major task must be handed over to a special subcommittee for preliminary deliberation. Each subcommittee has three conveners, who, as the name suggests, simply convene meetings, but they are also the responsible persons, especially the chief convener, who is also the chairman of the committee. The importance of the chairman and responsible person in a meeting is evident, and it is "human nature" for some councilors to actively campaign for the position of convener beforehand.

The previous budget reviewers and conveners were councilors Xu Yongzuo, Li Wenjie, and He Yuanming. The efforts these three councilors made in the last budget review are truly admirable. Accountant Li Wenjie spent an entire night working on the budget without sleep.

Yesterday's election results, without these two experienced accountants, were somewhat unexpected. In fact, the election of He Yuanming, Yu Shun, and Wang Naixu as councilors was also "what everyone hoped for." However, when He Yuanming was nominated as chairman, he seemed very displeased and insisted on refusing the position. The atmosphere in the small meeting place suddenly became tense, and reporters crowded into that corner, looking at each other. The councilors repeatedly asked He to take his seat, but he refused to agree under any circumstances. Councilor Xu Yongzuo retreated from the position of temporary convener to a seat on the side. Councilor Li Wenjie, with the second-highest number of votes, was repeatedly nominated by those present to take the position of chairman, but he also refused, saying, "We worked hard last time and should take turns." The stalemate lasted for a quarter of an hour, and the meeting could not begin. Vice-Chairman Xu Jiyi said, "Since they have been elected, they should hold the meeting in order." But it was to no avail. Finally, someone suggested, "Then Mr. Yu Shun should take the position." Councilor Yu Shun's situation was, of course, also difficult. While hesitating, he said repeatedly, "Don't be polite, don't be polite." When it was his turn, it seemed that it was "inevitable" and he could no longer refuse. So, he stood up resolutely and said, "Let's do it then." Finally, the stalemate was broken, and the first meeting was hastily completed.

The second incident to be mentioned is a scene from the sixth Police Affairs Group election. The sixth group elected Hou Jiyuan as the first-place candidate, and there should have been two more. However, Jiang Pingluo, Zhang Naizuo, and Fan Shusheng all received the same number of votes. While trying to find a solution, Jiang Pingluo suddenly remembered that he had not voted for himself, so he wanted to add one vote. Reporters in another group only heard loud noises from this side and hurriedly looked over. It turned out that Councilor Zhang Naizuo was getting angry: "How can we re-elect after the votes have been counted? I object! I don't agree! I am completely against it!" Councilor Jiang then said, "I withdraw voluntarily! I don't want to participate at all! I am not here to be elected! I will definitely withdraw!" After much commotion, the Secretary-General and secretaries came to mediate and came up with a satisfactory solution: drawing lots. As a result, Zhang Naizuo and Fei Shusheng were elected. The lively scene finally subsided.

### A Female Traitor of the Kawashima Yoshiko Type, Han Youjie, Enslaved the Military and Civilians and Lured Guerrilla Forces, Active in North China for Twenty Years, Denied Chinese Citizenship at the First Trial in the High Court Yesterday, Obvious Crimes and Repeated Service in the Japanese Army

[Our Report] Yesterday afternoon, the High Court tried a suspected female traitor case involving someone who held an important position in the enemy's military. The protagonist is named Han Youjie, currently 41 years old, originally of Japanese nationality, named Nakajima Shigeko. Eighteen years ago, she married Han Jingtang from Lishu, Fengtian, in Beiping, and obtained Chinese citizenship, and took the name Han Youjie. The prosecutor's indictment alleged that after the September 18th Incident, the defendant served as an advisor to the staff department of the enemy chieftain Honjo Shigeru, and as the dean of the pseudo-Fengtian Shanlin Women's Middle School. After the July 7th Incident, she transferred to Beiping and served as an advisor to the enemy's military police and army intelligence agencies. She was responsible for liaising with the pseudo-local security maintenance association and also served as the director of the women's comforting class under Terauchi of the enemy's North China Front Army, using the name of comforting refugees and prisoners to enslave our military and civilians. Later, she served as a recruitment worker under Yamashita Tomoyuki, the commander of the enemy's Beijing corps. She was later promoted to colonel and engaged in luring our guerrilla forces. Subsequently, upon the order of Yamashita, she went to northern Manchuria to investigate the Soviet army, and then at the invitation of Ono, the commander of the enemy's Nanjing military police, and Shao Wenkai, the pseudo-governor of Henan Province, she went to Henan and Shandong provinces to lure more than 70,000 of our guerrilla forces. Last April, the commander of the enemy fleet wanted to contact the Dingyuan bandit army, and the defendant was ordered to carry out the task. After the victory, she also negotiated the matter of receiving enemy weapons and supplies. The above can be corroborated by the defendant's own account in the Military Command Bureau's handbook of her twenty years of activity in China. Therefore, her treason in carrying out military duties to endanger our country began as early as September 18th, and after the July 7th Incident, it became even more rampant, doing everything possible. After the victory, she even colluded with the traitorous bandits, plotting irregularities, and should be punished according to law.

Yesterday, the defendant wore a blue cheongsam with small red flowers, a yellow wool coat with green flowers, light yellow socks, and black cloth shoes. Her long hair was draped over her shoulders, and she wore a white hair clip. She was holding a child of about one year old with tangerines with a flag in her hand. When questioned by the presiding judge, the defendant claimed in a Japanese-accented Mandarin: Because her uncle worked in the Japanese Army Attaché Office in Beiping, she came to China in 1926 and studied at a French church school in Beiping. In 1928, she married Han Jingtang, and her parents were strongly opposed to this. In 1931, she went to the Northeast, and after repeated invitations, she was forced to serve as an advisor to Honjo Shigeru's staff department in the Kwantung Army, but she received no salary or letter of appointment. Only when the common people had requests that could not be fulfilled would she represent them in contacting the Japanese army. She only served as the dean of Shanlin Women's Middle School for four months.

During the July 7th Incident, the Japanese sent four telegrams from Shenyang inviting her, and she was forced to go to Beiping to serve as an advisor to the Japanese military police and army intelligence agencies. Later, she also served as the director of the women's comforting class under General Terauchi of the North China Front Army, all purely for the purpose of helping refugees, women and children. Within a few months of the July 7th Incident, she had already helped more than 50,000 people. Later, she served as a recruitment worker under Yamashita Tomoyuki, the commander of the Beijing corps, with a salary equivalent to that of a colonel. In Baoding, Zunhua, Shandong, and the Great Wall area in Hebei, she incorporated or helped or discharged more than 70,000 stray troops, including their families. Later, she was transferred to Manila by Yamashita. When the Japanese army was fighting the New Fourth Army in northern Jiangsu, Ono, the commander of the Nanjing military police, sent her to inquire about the situation of the people and distributed 60 million yuan worth of relief supplies to the people. In April of last year, when the situation in Japan became dangerous, she was ordered by the commander to go to northern Jiangsu to contact the New Fourth Army for peace, not to contact them with any intention of taking action. On June 1st, the New Fourth Army detained her, accusing her of being a spy, and monitored her for 80 days. She was released only after Japan surrendered, but a small team was assigned to monitor her and send her to Nanjing to contact the Japanese naval attaché office to hand over the guns, but she was unsuccessful. Later, because she and her six-month-old child were both sick, a cousin who was a doctor in Shanghai invited her to come to Shanghai with two guards and a doctor to be treated in the hospital. She arrived in Shanghai on September 21st last year and was reported to the Military Command Bureau by a traitorous policeman at the station and arrested. She was later transferred to the High Prosecutor's Office. Without much questioning, she was prosecuted on suspicion of treason. Although she married a Chinese man, her parents did not allow it. According to Japanese law, when marrying a foreigner, one must obtain the permission of their parents before being allowed to renounce their original nationality. Therefore, she has not yet acquired Chinese citizenship and is still Japanese. The prosecutor also accused her of working as a spy for the Japanese all along, but what she did was all relief work to help the people. Since she married a Chinese man, of course she loves China. She has six children and enough food at home, so there is no need to be a spy. Now, her husband, Han Jingtang, and her children are missing in the Northeast, and it is unknown whether they are dead or alive. After the court investigation, she was ordered to be returned to custody for further questioning at a later date. The defendant briefly spoke to two Japanese expatriates who remained in Shanghai and were in the courtroom, and then, holding her child, was escorted back to prison.

### Wang Jintian Interrogated Yesterday

[Another Report] Wang Jintian was accused of serving as a secret agent for the enemy's Minhang military police and as the head of Ganlu Township in the pseudo-Shenjiang County, oppressing the people. The High Court specially questioned Ueeda Masakazu, the former commander of the enemy's Minhang military police. According to him, he did not know Wang Jintian. Wang himself admitted to having served as the pseudo-township head, but not as a secret agent for the enemy's military police. The case will be re-examined at a later date.

### Indian Policeman Kartousin Case Concluded

The cases of Indian policeman Kartousin, a guard at the Shanghai Haifang Road concentration camp during the enemy and pseudo-government period who abused British expatriates, and Wang Shoulun, a translator at the enemy's military police North Sichuan Road headquarters, were concluded on the same day and are scheduled to be pronounced on the morning of the 14th of this month.

### More Than 3,000 Buildings Confiscated from the Enemy and Pseudo-Regimes

[Our Report] The Enemy and Pseudo-Property Handling Bureau has taken over the enemy and pseudo-government real estate in this city. After verifying the property rights and approving the return of the properties, the base land totals 323 units, and the real estate totals 762 units (each unit ranging from one building to hundreds of buildings). The number of Anglo-American expatriate properties returned is 730 units. The Enemy and Pseudo-Property Handling Bureau has determined to confiscate more than 300 units of enemy and pseudo-government houses, totaling more than 3,000 buildings. The total land area that has been determined to be confiscated is 9.866 acres and 796 square feet. There are still more than 8,000 acres being re-examined by the Central Trust Bureau. All real estate that has been determined to be confiscated will be auctioned according to the regulations of the central government.

### Ohlhaver Bureau Espionage Case Re-examined by the US Military Court

[Our Report] The Ohlhaver Bureau espionage case was re-examined by the US military court yesterday, with Mori, the former director of the Japanese Army Intelligence Department stationed in Shanghai, testifying.

According to the Japanese, after Germany surrendered, the spies of the Ohlhaver Bureau voluntarily cooperated with the Japanese side and continued to engage in espionage. Although Ohlhaver issued an order to dissolve the bureau, he stated in a telegram to the spies that he did not object to individuals cooperating with the Japanese military authorities and never prevented the Japanese side from using the bureau's spies. As for himself, he claimed that he was weak and ill and could not continue to work, but was willing to assist as much as possible. At that time, the German receiving station in Shanghai was the best radio station in the Shanghai area. After it was taken over by the Japanese, it was continued to be operated by German and Italian personnel until the end of the war.

During yesterday's hearing, there was an unexpected incident. Chief Defense Counsel Lieutenant Colonel Paulding suddenly announced that lawyer Yao Zhaodi had withdrawn from the defense group. It is reported that Lawyer Yao was recently the one who represented Shen Ke, one of the spies, in suing Mr. Lunnell of the Associated Press.

### "War of Resistance Wife" Case Continues: Sa Benju's Meritorious Service to the Country During the War; Defense Lawyers Argue that There are Mitigating Circumstances

[Our Report] Sa Benju, the nephew of Admiral Sa Zhenbing, originally married Chen Jizheng. During the War of Resistance, Sa went to work in the interior and married his colleague Shi Biren. After the victory, Chen filed a lawsuit with the local prosecutor's office, and the prosecutor charged Sa Benju and Shi Biren with bigamy. This scene of a "War of Resistance wife" involved in a lawsuit was re-examined in court yesterday morning. Shi Biren and Sa Benju were both present in court. Sa's defense lawyer presented that Sa had been ordered by Chairman Chiang to rescue Lieutenant Colonel Hunter, the British Ambassador's Army Attaché, Major Jude, and Mr. Watts, the general manager of Kailuan Coal Mine and head of the British Information Office, to Chongqing. When the Japanese army entered the concession, he disguised them as transporting cloth, loaded them into wooden boxes, transported them out of the Japanese army blockade line, and transferred them to the interior, for which he was praised by Chairman Chiang. Although this matter is not related to the main body of the case, Sa's meritorious service to the country can also be used as a reference when making a judgment. Moreover, Sa and Shi's combination was based on close emotional ties from working together. Moreover, marrying a War of Resistance wife was popular in the rear at the time, so the facts are excusable. The case is now scheduled for further examination on the 14th of this month.

### Where Does the News Come From? The Tension of Reporters When the Telephone Rings

[Our Special Report] An ordinary second-run movie theater. Although the colorful advertising sign in front of the door is full of exaggerated and exciting words, the picture of the heroine is peeling and tattered because of the heavy rain last night. The show is about to start, and the audience is arriving in a steady stream, but not in large numbers. Suddenly, an inconspicuous vagrant walked in and took out a dark thing from his side. A hand went up, and there was a deafening explosion in the theater, and seven or eight people fell to the ground...

Ten minutes later, news reporters appeared in the hospital, the police station, and the scene of the incident, with the flashbulbs on their cameras flashing.

Tomorrow, on the news pages of this city, the list of injured people and the extent of their injuries will be listed one by one.

All of Shanghai, all of China, the whole world—it seems that news reporters are watching in every corner. Every day, they transmit all the news to the world at the fastest speed.

The twentieth century is a century of movement, and news reporters are the ones who record these activities.

You may wonder how reporters know so much detail. For example, when the movie theater was bombed, there was clearly no reporter on the scene. How did they get the news in a matter of minutes?

If all of Shanghai's telephone lines were suddenly damaged, you would guess the reporters' secret. Because if the telephone bells of all Shanghai do not ring for one day, you may hardly see a newspaper tomorrow. The news that comes from telegrams is really pitifully small.

Admittedly, under the current circumstances, the telephone equipment of various newspapers is far from meeting the actual needs, but the telephone is still the most important source of all news. The telephones in the newsrooms rarely stop ringing, and the reporters' ways of answering the phone are also diverse and spectacular. Some speak Shanghainese, some speak Cantonese, and of course, Mandarin is the most common language. In addition, English is used a lot, and French is also used.

The same person may use several completely different tones when answering the phone several times—this time he may be a very polite gentleman, and a few minutes later he may immediately turn into a majestic and high-spirited "tycoon." News reporters are somewhat similar to theater actors in this regard. They are often frank, straightforward, and concise, but sometimes they specialize in diplomatic wording. Often, when hearing the most important news, the reporters' expressions are calm, as if they don't care at all. But as soon as he puts down the phone, you will see him extremely nervous, sometimes writing non-stop, sometimes immediately preparing to set off in pursuit, and the newspaper's archives are also busy finding all the reference materials that can be matched with the news.

Long-distance calls are of course even more important. Sometimes, as soon as a telephone report is recorded, the entire newspaper immediately mobilizes and publishes an extra. When many people walk into the newsroom of a newspaper, they often think that the reporters seem very relaxed, but in fact they are prepared, they are waiting to move at all times, because the most important events are often sudden events.

A political assassination may affect the global situation; the recklessness of a few Japanese soldiers was the beginning of eight years of war. And the people who see the importance of these accidental events, risk their lives at any time to seek the truth, and then faithfully record it, are the news reporters.

Whether it is the fire-hot summer or the freezing winter, they are always ready to mobilize.

And their mobilization order is often the urgent, hurried, and impatient ringing of the telephone bell.

### National Products Exhibition Market Postponed for Five Days

The National Products Exhibition Market, organized by the Shanghai Branch of the China Production Promotion Association, was originally scheduled to open on Double Ten Day. The building construction of the venue at No. 444 Nanjing West Road (next to the Ciro's dance hall) has been completed, but in order to allow the national product manufacturers participating in the exhibition to have sufficient time to arrange their exhibits, the market committee decided to postpone it for five days to officially open at 10:00 AM on the 15th of this month, so that they can prepare in an unhurried manner and ensure that this national product exhibition, the first one held in this city since the victory of the War of Resistance, reaches a state of perfection.

### Brought Bank Funds to Order Beer; Desperate Over Losses, He Committed Suicide

[Our Report] Zhang Zhiqiang (28 years old), from Ningbo, worked in a bank in his hometown.

### Answering Readers: Medicine and Health

(1) Mental Confusion

Wei Jianguo asks: My wife is 29 years old. She suffered a shock at the age of 20 and developed mental confusion. She recovered after two months of treatment, but she still suffers from irritability in her chest and cannot sleep peacefully. She even neglects her child while breastfeeding and needs to have both of her pulse points on her wrists tightly bound until her hands become numb and swollen before she returns to normal. This lasts about 10 to 30 minutes each time. I sincerely ask for a cure. (1) What is this disease? (2) Is there any effective medicine that can cure it? (3) Does this disease have any impact on her health?

[Answer from Dr. Tang Renjin, Doctor of Medicine] (1) It may be "Hebephrenic" schizophrenia (i.e., mania). (2) Tincture of valerian or bromide preparations can be tried. Mental and neurological physicians can be consulted (name, address, and fees are not listed). (3) It can cause general weakness.

(2) Persistent Ringworm

Qi Minghua asks: I often suffer from damp-heat eczema, which has persisted for years. Applying Ganlu and other skin disease treatments has little effect. This summer it is even worse, and my arms are covered with spots, as small as prickly heat, which are incredibly itchy and unbearable. There is also a sticky, thick fluid. I don't know what medicine to apply. I am currently injecting calcium gluconate, but I don't know if it will be effective. Please answer the above two questions.

[Answer from Dr. Tang Renjin, Doctor of Medicine] It is probably scabies. Sulfur ointment and other preparations can be tried. Injecting calcium is an adjunctive treatment that may be helpful.

(3) Congenital Edema

Shi Yuzhi asks: My child was born last July with a congenital deformity. The arms are different in thickness (left is thick, right is thin). After the first month, a soft lump of flesh bulged out from the left side of the neck, without a nucleus. Applying medicine was still ineffective. At the time, I didn't pay much attention to it, but recently it has gradually swollen, extending to the throat, seemingly without pain. Repeated consultations have been ineffective. Finally, after examination at Guangci Hospital, it was diagnosed as "congenital lymphedema pain," which requires surgery. I don't know if there is a risk to life. Please answer.

[Answer from Dr. Tang Renjin, Doctor of Medicine] Based on the condition, it is either a cyst or a hematoma. Surgery should be performed, or a test puncture should be performed first, which can be decided by a surgeon.

### Allocation of Yarn: Director Song Instructs on Policy; Allocation Price to be Based on Original Cost; Municipal Authorities to be Invited to Participate in Supervision

[Our Newspaper's Report] The price of cotton yarn and cloth in this city has been rising frequently recently, affecting the livelihood of ordinary people, which is not common in Jiangsu. The Allocation Committee of the Cotton Yarn United Association, composed of national and private yarn factories, is also facing increasing difficulties in its joint allocation work due to the widening gap between the allocation price and the black market price. To address this, President Song specially summoned the committee members of national and private yarn factories of the Textile Industry Management Committee yesterday afternoon at around 2 PM. Those present included Dong Yunzhang, Wu Weijing, Li Shengbo, Wang Yangxian, Wang Qiyu, Rong Hongyuan, Tang Xinghai, and others. Mayor Wu also participated in the meeting. President Song stated that the first round of yarn allocation by the Joint Allocation Association had been successful and commendable. However, the effectiveness of the second round of allocation was not as good as the first. The recent rise in yarn and cloth prices in Shanghai is attributed to expensive raw materials and the peak season for yarn and cloth sales, which is said to be monopolized. However, another reason is that some private yarn factories did not comply with the allocation price set by the Joint Allocation Association during the second round of allocation. Therefore, he earnestly hopes that all members of the Joint Allocation Association will be self-disciplined and self-managed, and not allow this good organization to exist in name only.

Existing Organization to Maintain the Status Quo Temporarily

Song also earnestly advised that the original joint allocation organization should temporarily maintain the status quo, but its content should be actively strengthened and enriched. At the same time, local governments should be invited to participate in assisting in supervision to ensure that incidents of outward compliance and inward defiance do not happen again. He proposed a trial run of joint yarn allocation.

Unified Allocation and Sales May be Restored

If this is still ineffective, the government will be forced to adopt the unified allocation and purchase methods used in the wartime capital of Chongqing. That is, the government will uniformly purchase raw materials and uniformly allocate them to each factory. For the finished products, the government will give legal profits, uniformly purchase them, and then uniformly allocate them for use. It is reported that President Song agreed to reasonably resolve the opinions raised by the private factories yesterday. For example, the government will try to supply the foreign exchange needed to purchase foreign cotton when necessary. Regarding power supply, it is also actively negotiating to purchase generators in order to increase power generation. The working hours of workers will be restored to pre-war conditions as much as possible.

Increased Production Possible with Resolved Prerequisites

The responsible persons of each factory stated that if the two problems of electricity and working hours can be resolved, the current monthly yarn production of each factory in the city can be increased by one-third, from 60,000 pieces to 90,000 pieces per month. As for the allocation price of joint allocation, Song Zisheng stated that although it does not need to be fixed at one level, he ultimately hopes that the allocation price is reasonable and must not be calculated purely based on the cost of reproduction, but must be based on the original cost. The meeting lasted for more than an hour before the members took their leave.

Comprehensive Control to Prevent Disconnection

In addition, well-informed sources observed that the issue of yarn and cloth allocation in the city in the future will be comprehensively resolved after President Song's instructions to all relevant parties. The price of yarn and cloth, from yarn factories and various replicated product factories to wholesalers and retailers, will be mutually linked and reasonably adjusted, and will not be allowed to be disconnected or surge sharply. It is reported that Mayor Wu's opinion on the yarn and cloth issue in the city in the future is to adopt centralized application and centralized allocation measures in order to simplify the allocation steps and standardize the allocation price. It is reported that Mayor Wu will convene the persons in charge of various yarn factories and cotton yarn replicated product associations in the coming days to jointly study the detailed methods for joint yarn allocation.

Allocation Price Unchanged, Market Price Drops Slightly

The Yarn Factory Joint Allocation Committee held its usual yarn meeting yesterday afternoon. It was decided to sell a standard amount of 20-count cotton yarn, with 643 pieces allocated to private factories and 813.5 pieces to the Construction and Development Spinning Company, all allocated according to the application amount. The selling price for 400 pounds of 20-count cotton yarn remains 1.5 million yuan per piece. The Construction and Development Spinning Company opened eight types of yarn yesterday, of which 32-count and 60-count and below are all spot goods, while 20-count, 40-count, and 42-count are futures. The yarn market turned sharply downwards yesterday. After the opening of the market in the morning, the industry was eager to sell due to tight funds, and the price gradually went downstream. 20-count yarn dropped about 100,000 yuan compared to last weekend, and fine yarn also dropped 150,000 to 70,000 yuan. Customer sales turned silent. Except for the Cantonese merchants slightly adding fine yarn, the Han merchants rarely made any progress. The local weaving factories instead saw sell-offs, also due to tight funds.

### Opening of the Construction and Development Spinning Company's Retail Store on Double Tenth Day

The Construction and Development Spinning Company recently prepared a retail store at the original site of the Old Shanghai Store at the intersection of Nanjing West Road and Moore Road. The renovation has now been completed, and it is reported that it is scheduled to open on Double Tenth Day.

### After the Resumption of US Dollar Trading, Money Exchange Businesses Have a Market but No Sales; Police Bureau Ordered to Crack Down on the Black Market

Money exchange shops that operate in US dollar trading have resumed buying and selling US dollars yesterday, but are restricted by the three US dollar buying and selling methods agreed upon by the municipal government and the central bank. Those who bought at high prices are still taking a wait-and-see attitude and are unwilling to sell. Although there are quite a few people who want to buy at the central bank's exchange rate plus 5%, there are almost no sellers, resulting in the US dollar trading entering a state of stagnation yesterday. The quoted price of money exchange businesses has always been around 3,500 yuan, with no purchases and no sales. It is reported that the transaction price in the dark market has fallen from 4,200 yuan to around 4,000 yuan, and some damaged ones have been traded at 3,800 yuan. All of this is not common. As a result, it has fallen compared to last Saturday. Hong Kong bills have shrunk to 107 yuan due to the need for Shanghai reports, but the city's funds are tight. Therefore, although the opening rose to 920 yuan, it fell back to 860 yuan in the middle, and finally stood at the 900 yuan mark, resulting in another increase of 40 yuan. The Hong Kong exchange rate was reported at 930 yuan, the Indian exchange rate at 1,130 yuan, and the British exchange rate at 14,500 yuan, all affected by the sharp drop in the Hong Kong Shanghai bill market, but there were very few transactions. There are still few transactions in the US exchange rate.

In addition, the Police Bureau has been ordered by Mayor Wu that anyone who illegally buys and sells US dollars on the black market will be cracked down on and severely punished according to law.

President Song of the Executive Yuan received Bei Zuyi, the president of the Central Bank, at the office at 9 AM yesterday to inquire about matters related to suppressing the US dollar.

### Resale of Allocated Yarn: Allocation Suspended to 14 Companies Yesterday; New Light Claims It Was an Exchange, Not Profiteering

[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding the resale of allocated yarn by the New Light Underwear Factory, the reporter specially visited the person in charge of the factory, who stated as follows: The factory currently has 176 looms, requiring approximately 300 pieces of 42-count and 40-count yarn per month (20-count yarn and the thread needed for underwear are not included). In September, the factory applied for and received 23 pieces from the Construction and Development Spinning Company, which was far too short. Therefore, it had to be purchased from the black market. It also claimed that on September 9th, one piece of 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn obtained from the Construction and Development Spinning Company had to be delivered from the Wusong Yunpingbang Factory. Beforehand, it was necessary to go to the factory to assign the goods and indicate the date before they could be picked up, but the round-trip transportation costs and time were not cost-effective, and the factory was in urgent need. Therefore, Zhang Jun from the Datai Yarn Shop (who usually handled the replacement of missing yarn) volunteered to exchange it for the same spot goods and issued a certificate. Therefore, it was not comparable to reselling for profit. However, Shi Xinquan, the specialist from the Construction and Development Spinning Company who investigated the case, stated that since the price of yarn soared, the Construction and Development Spinning Company had to take emergency measures to temporarily limit the allocation to actual users in order to balance the market and maintain industrial production, so as not to affect the suspension of replica production. This measure was originally a temporary expedient. At the same time, the company actively increased spindles and increased production, painstakingly maintaining. However, some small manufacturers not only did not engage in increased production with the allocated cotton yarn, but instead sold it on the black market, which is regrettable. After receiving the notification, the company immediately started investigating the facts and has now concluded the investigation. There are as many as 14 companies, including New Light, Dashi, Dachang, Huafu, Rongxin, Wanshun, Qinyu, Hongxiang, Shengsheng, Rongfeng, Huaguang, Tongmengxiang, Yihua, and Taichang. In addition to suspending the allocation to the above factories, the competent authorities are studying countermeasures to prevent recurrence.

### Cotton Cloth Flat and Weak

The cloth market yesterday was characterized by customer sales taking a wait-and-see attitude and tight funds, so there were few transactions and the price also gradually declined. The Longtou fine cloth opened by the Construction and Development Spinning Company on Saturday opened at 86,500 yuan, and then dropped to 86,000 yuan. The market situation is still trending towards weariness.

### Different Views on Cocoon Purchase Price: Silk Capital Too High, Purchase Price Should be Increased; Already Exceeding Selling Price, Further Increase is Not Appropriate

According to silk industry sources, this year's autumn silkworms only yielded more than 8,000 loads of dried cocoons, which was unexpectedly small. The current purchase price is 180,000 yuan per load of fresh cocoons, which is equivalent to 480,000 yuan when made into dried cocoons. Adding expenses and by-product costs, it actually requires 700,000 yuan per load. 5.5 loads of dried cocoons produce one load of raw silk, and the cost of a single load is 700,000 yuan. Adding three months of interest calculated at 2.5% requires 300,000 yuan. The total cost of each load of raw silk is at least 4.8 million yuan. However, the China Trust Bureau's third batch of spring cocoon purchase price is still set at 3.8 million yuan per load, and only 2,600 loads have been purchased. The association specially convened a board meeting last Saturday to discuss the results and decided to request the competent authorities to slightly increase the limit price for the purchase of raw silk, adding 400,000 yuan per load for each grade of ABCD to encourage manufacturers to produce more high-quality raw silk and benefit exports. This suggestion was formally submitted to the China Trust Bureau yesterday. However, the bureau believes that the current purchase price is already 20% to 30% higher compared to the foreign silk market price and cannot be increased further. However, famous manufacturers argued that the current cost of the silk market is inherently high. If the price is not adjusted quickly, they will be unable to bear it.

### Gold Price Falls Back

### Is the Economic Downturn Coming? Predictions by British and American Economists

[United Press Washington, 6th] According to economists, observing the recent situation, there will be a trend of economic downturn in the United States in the late 1947 or early 1948, but the situation will not be serious and will not last long. According to Hegen, an economic expert at the National Design Association, the current gradual increase in inventory is a sign that supply has gradually adapted to demand.

### Fuel Control: President Song Reviews Again; Summoned Xu Letian and Zhao Zengyu to Inquire

[Our Newspaper's Report] Recently, the market price of white coal has skyrocketed, mainly due to the imminent winter season, and holders are taking advantage of the scarcity of white coal arriving in Shanghai to hoard and raise prices. However, although the market price is high, there are very few transactions. Xu Letian, the chairman of the Fuel Management Committee, revealed to reporters yesterday that since the committee began to collect and transport white coal to supply the city's winter needs, it is now confirmed that a batch of more than 1,800 tons of large pieces from Hongji, Vietnam, has arrived in Shanghai and will continue to be loaded. American white coal is also being loaded. The Fuel Management Committee also stated to reporters that white coal blocks are only for use by restaurants and wealthy families for winter heating, and the use is limited. The rise and fall of market prices has little impact on people's livelihood. The committee has long supplied a large amount of white coal dust needed for fuel for daily use. Therefore, the market price of coal balls has been stable for a long time. It is hoped that general white coal block users will not engage in high-price searches. Soon, when a large amount of white coal arrives in Shanghai and is sold at a flat price, they will suffer losses.

President Song Ziwén of the Executive Yuan summoned Xu Letian, the chairman of the Fuel Management Committee, and Zhao Zengyu, the director of the Public Utilities Bureau, yesterday to inquire in detail about the fuel control situation in the city, as well as the amount of coal arriving and the supply situation, and held a meeting. It is said that regarding the fuel control issue, the Municipal Council believes that the results of controlling fuel have had a significant impact on industry, commerce, and the general public, and unanimously passed a resolution requesting the government to abolish fuel control and allow merchants to collect and purchase it themselves. Mr. Song summoned Mr. Xu and Mr. Zhao to conduct a special review of this and decide whether fuel control needs to be continued or abolished.

### White Coal Sees High Prices Again

The white coal market has seen most of the scattered coal blocks in hand sold out successively. Therefore, a shortage of white coal blocks has reappeared in the market, and the trend of price increases is again prevalent. All goods are showing new high prices. Due to the Fuel Committee's restrictions on coal ball factories from applying to purchase raw coal starting this month, and with coal ball factories currently in a period of strong sales, they are short of raw materials and can only search for them in the coal market. As a result, market prices have suddenly risen.

### Tight Money Rumors Abound, Stock Market Greatly Affected

Yesterday, the Shanghai stock market was greatly affected by tight money. As soon as the market opened, stocks generally fell. After the opening, they quickly rebounded from the low, but after various stocks rose, they were still met with profit-taking and could not sustain the gains. From 10:20 AM, the situation gradually stabilized, with the Guangdong and Northern trading houses entering the market, gradually rebounding. At 10:35 AM, a major player from a securities firm heavily invested in Wing On Cotton Mill and American Asiatic Company, and Guangdong interests also bought Wing On Cotton Mill, causing the market to improve again. However, around 11:00 AM, stocks still retreated under gradual selling pressure, and the weakness extended to 11:20 AM. Sichuan trading houses made significant purchases, and retail investors and short covering added momentum, causing various stocks to rise sharply. Wing On Cotton Mill rose to the 800 yuan level, and American Asiatic Company reached 4450 yuan. Apart from these two major stocks, only Sino-British remained high. The others did not show any improvement and remained followers. After 11:30 AM, high prices gradually fell back as profitable positions were sold. A major securities player and Northern trading houses who had initially entered the market in the morning sold off. Coupled with rumors of problems at Commercial Bank deposits, market sentiment became even more fearful, and long positions were relentlessly liquidated. Wing On Cotton Mill fell to a low of 769 yuan. American Asiatic Company briefly approached the morning low of 4230 yuan before temporarily stopping. At the close, retail investors and short covering provided support, slightly pulling up prices. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Wing On Cotton Mill, Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing each fell by half a percent, American Asiatic Company by slightly less than three-tenths of a percent, Sino-British down half a percent, China Textile, Tong Pen, Match, Asia Li, Lou Interior, Cement, and Jing 緰 each down slightly more than half a percent, China Silk alone remained flat, Wuhe Company slightly declined, and Datong Huafeng fell by about 10%. The total trading volume was 11.4 million shares. Off-exchange stocks also experienced slight declines. Chuxu stocks also fell. Except for Ye Guang, most stocks were sluggish. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Yisheng and Yinglian each fell by half a percent. Paper, Shipping, Copper, Jardine Matheson, and Yibier although decreased were not as much. Ye Guang slightly increased.

### Rayon Stable, Yesterday's Closing Price Maintained

Yesterday, the silk market was quite stable. 120-count Tianqiao rayon with luster maintained last Saturday's closing price of 3.7 million yuan. Non-branded rayon differed by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan. Semi-lustrous rayon traded at 3.5 million to 3.4 million yuan. 150-count rayon with luster was priced similar to 120-count semi-lustrous rayon. 150-count and 75-count semi-lustrous rayon were both offered at 2.89 million yuan. Factory agents were also very stable. Yesterday's asking prices were slightly weaker than last weekend, but transactions were rare. Because the spot market was very stable, silk houses were greatly concerned that it would be difficult to replenish their stock after selling, leading to a lack of trading. According to industry insiders, there are currently very few non-industry holders of goods, so there is no speculative activity, and the market price will not fluctuate. Sleep silk continued to weaken, and Sheng Hang goods all saw price declines.

### Inspectors Sun and Wang of the Ministry of Education Report on the Educational Situation in Taiwan Province, Students' Actions and Attitudes Are Already Japanized

[Our Nanjing dispatch] After Taiwan Province returned to the motherland, the Ministry of Education attached great importance to education in the province and specially sent inspectors Wang Peiren and Sun Xiatang to inspect it. They have now completed their inspection and returned to the ministry to report on the educational situation in Taiwan Province and its advantages. The key points of their inspection report are summarized below:

Eighty-Two Out of One Hundred Children Attend School

Since its restoration in November last year, Taiwan has worked hard to popularize the national language, promote the Three Principles of the People, and promote China's inherent moral spirit. It is also aware of the efforts to eliminate the poisonous legacy of Japanese education in order to conform to China's educational system and laws and achieve "Sinicization." At present, schools at all levels have been generally adjusted. There are currently provincial educational institutions, including one normal school, one law and business school, one vocational school, one agricultural school, four normal schools, 38 middle schools, four vocational schools, nine agricultural schools, seven commercial schools, two fishery schools, eight provincial national schools, three provincial folk education centers, one library, one local museum, one national language promotion committee, one language supplementary school, eleven national language promotion centers, and a total of ten industrial technology and supplementary schools, and two schools for the blind and deaf. The above includes four provincial higher education institutions, 69 secondary education institutions, eight national schools, and three social education institutions. As for county and city-level and private educational institutions, there are 75 county and city middle schools, 44 vocational schools, nine private middle schools, ten private vocational schools, and 1,031 national schools. According to statistics from the Japanese Ministry of Education, the number of children enrolled in school accounts for 82.75% of the school-age children. Social education institutions at the county and city level are being planned, and only Tainan County has established a folk education center. However, libraries are very common in counties and cities, with eight county libraries, municipal libraries, and 83 public and three private libraries.

Education Expenses Account for 30% of the Budget

School buildings and equipment at all levels are better than those in the interior. Even the school buildings of national schools in the countryside are mostly magnificent and rich, but in wartime, or have not been repaired for a long time, or have been bombed, and damaged and collapsed buildings are everywhere. Because they have been educated by the Japanese for a long time, the students are mostly thrifty and polite. All their actions and attitudes have been Japanized. They are neat and strict, but they lack vitality and initiative. The teachers in various places have an excellent spirit of service. Even if they have only received a small amount of maintenance funds for three or four months, they still go to school on time to teach every day. However, before the restoration, most of the teachers in various schools were Japanese. Although there were teachers from the mainland here after the restoration, there were not many, and most of the teachers were Taiwanese. During the Japanese rule, the Taiwanese were restricted from receiving normal education, so there are many unqualified teachers now. For example, in national schools in various places, only three to five people in each school have graduated from normal school. Regarding education funding, according to the 35th-year (April to December) provisional expenditure budget of the Education Department of the Provincial Governor's Office, the income section is tuition, totaling 1,740,000 Taiwan dollars, the regular expenditure is 66,605,431 Taiwan dollars, and the temporary expenditure is 103,036,010 Taiwan dollars. On average, education expenses in each county and city account for about 30% of the budget.

The Father-Brother Association is of Great Help to the School

After the inspection, inspectors Wang and Sun believe that the advantages of Taiwan's education can be summarized as follows: (1) The province pays attention to the training and lectures of primary and secondary school teachers, and the provincial and county administrative authorities can work hard to promote them. (2) The calculation method of the salary of educational workers at the provincial and county levels is the same, and it is the same as that of civil servants in various departments. The salary is fair, and there are no complaints from superiors and subordinates. (3) Most of the teachers in grade schools can arrive at school on time every day and return home on time, and their spirit of service is commendable. (4) The school buildings at all levels are magnificent and the equipment is good. There are some schools whose scale and equipment are not available in the country. (5) Most of the students are simple and can abide by discipline and know etiquette. (6) Local employees and students are working hard to learn the national language. (7) Vocational education in various parts of the province is very developed, and all facilities are better than those in the mainland. (8) Public and private libraries are lined up in various places, which is convenient for students and the public to read. (9) Gentlemen and student parents have a Father-Brother Association organization for the school in the location, which is of great help to the school.

### Municipal Elementary Schools Collect Teacher Respect Money, Yesterday's Declaration Stated

The Municipal Elementary School Teachers' Association has made a statement regarding the collection of teacher respect money. The declaration issued yesterday stated the following in general terms: Since the victory, we have exhausted our efforts and voices to呼薇 for the treatment of . However, the answer that the country and society have given us is only verbal sympathy and a small favor. When we consider Chairman Jiang’s slogan of "Education First," we cannot help but sigh up to the sky and bow our heads! This semester, the Municipal Education Bureau sympathized with our Qing difficulties and had no authority to adjust living expenses. Therefore, it continued the name of teacher respect money from the previous semester and ordered each school to collect teacher respect money. This method is something that we ourselves feel is putting the cart before the horse and does not help the matter. It is not the true meaning of the repeated appeals of the Association colleagues. However, for the sincerity of the Municipal Education authorities to seek perfection, the Association colleagues urgently waited to die, so they first followed the order to collect money to solve the urgent need. As for the request to rationally adjust the treatment, it will not only not be suspended because of this, but will also achieve the goal of success in the shortest time. We hereby inform all the elders, brothers, sisters, and sisters in the city that our collection of teacher respect money is an emergency treatment method. We hope that this is the last time. We hope that reasonable treatment of the root cause will be adjusted immediately so that we can serve with peace of mind. We also hope that people from all walks of life will give assistance so that our wishes can be realized soon. Then education is fortunate! Colleagues are fortunate!

Examining the reasons, there are three main factors: veteran players are gradually retiring, and there is a lack of successors; some players have changed their service areas; and the sponsors of various teams lack the strength to support them. Being elected as chairman at this time, I deeply feel the weight of the responsibility and the long road ahead. I will dedicate my efforts to the best of my ability and work with all the committee members to shoulder the arduous task. After the registration deadline, the committee will send letters to solicit opinions from each team, hoping that each team can embody the spirit of harmony and cooperation, express well-intentioned suggestions, so that both the teams and the league can benefit in the future. The biggest crisis for football in this city after the war is the failure to restore school leagues, resulting in a lack of new talent. If school sports are silent, then social sports will inevitably decline in their later years. Therefore, social sports should start with school sports.

### News from Overseas Chinese Education in Southeast Asia: 600 Overseas Chinese Schools in Vietnam Recover; Over 2,000 Schools in Malaya Return to Operation; Nearly 300 More Schools Added in the Dutch East Indies

[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] The Ministry of Education attaches great importance to the education of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia. It has sent personnel to Vietnam, Malaya, and the Dutch East Indies to inspect the situation. According to recent surveys of overseas Chinese education in these areas: (1) Vietnam: There are approximately 600,000 overseas Chinese, with over 700 overseas Chinese schools before the war. The damage during the war was not significant, and most continued to operate. Currently, 600 schools have been restored, but they are often subject to various restrictions from the local government, such as not allowing the establishment of new schools. (2) Malaya: There are approximately 3 million overseas Chinese in Malaya, with over 3,000 overseas Chinese schools. Sixty percent of these schools were suspended during the war. After efforts to restore them, over 2,200 schools have been restored to date. (3) Dutch East Indies: There are 1.1 million overseas Chinese with over 1,200 schools. Because overseas Chinese highly value the education of their children, over 390 schools have recently been added.

### Taiwan Tea in a State of Decline

— Taiwan Air Mail News, 18th, Our Special Correspondent Jiang Muyun

Taiwan's special products are now uniformly showing a state of declining production and sales. People love to recall the numbers from the Japanese rule era. For example, in 1940, the total amount of special products imported was 408,650 (unit: thousand yen), and the export was 592,390. Oolong tea, which is famous, accounted for 3.6% of the total export. In 1943, the export value was 22,652 yuan (unit: thousand yen), second only to rice and sugar. This illustrates the golden age of Taiwan's trade and the position of tea in the overall export.

However, in the one year from the restoration to the present, tea can be said to have completely stagnated, with no production and no sales. Recently, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union have successively purchased 100,000 pounds of aged tea, and it is generally believed that Taiwan tea has regained the international market. However, knowledgeable people believe that without starting from the basics, it is difficult to maintain normal international trade permanently. The current stage is the beginning of the tea industry's vitality, but it is also the end of its melancholy.

Both Government-Operated and Private Enterprises Have Strong Strength

The main varieties of Taiwan tea are Baozhong tea, Oolong tea, and black tea. Brick tea is only a by-product for sale to the Soviet Union. There are also several types of green tea. Because it is incompatible with the planting in Japan, Taiwan, which is suitable in terms of climate and geography, has focused on the planting and harvesting of pure black tea in the past.

Japanese companies that attempted to monopolize the tea industry here, such as Mitsui, Tokumoto, Toyoko, Sansho, Taiwan Agriculture, and other joint-stock companies, as well as Toya, Narooka Shoten, and Nozawa Gumi Taipei Branch, owned a tea plantation area of 3,145 Jia (equivalent to over 48,000 mu in mainland China), which were all taken over by the Department of Agriculture and Forestry. In addition, there are two experiment stations and one tea training institute. The eight units that were taken over were merged by the government into the Taiwan Tea Corporation. Currently, they have three refining factories, one of which is not in operation, and fourteen crude tea factories, ten of which are in operation, and four of which are still shut down due to damaged machinery. The tea training institute, which has been closed for three or four years, according to the person in charge of the tea section, is preparing to enroll students in October of this year, with one term per year, to train new tea cadres. It has over twenty Jia of tea plantations and a practical factory, which is exclusively for the students to practice in and is currently under renovation. Private tea companies also had great power in the past. They have trade associations and also corporate tea companies, mainly to avoid the manipulation and exploitation of foreign companies and middlemen. Through the organization of tea farmers throughout the province, in February of this year, they merged the Taiwan Tea Export Joint-Stock Company, Taiwan Packaging Container Manufacturing Joint-Stock Company, and Taiwan Brick Tea Joint-Stock Company, and acquired all the shares of Xingnan and Pengnan Companies. The company has the province's only brick tea machinery and skilled workers. Before the war, there were over a hundred tea merchants, and now there are over seventy, owning 37,653 Jia of tea plantations (equivalent to 180,000 mu in mainland China), 213 crude tea factories, and 80 refined tea factories.

Both the government and private sectors have laid the foundation for the international trade of Taiwan tea. Until after the war, exports were affected due to maritime transportation, and production greatly decreased. The bleak picture of the tea industry last year and this year is truly unbearable to recall!

Tea Merchants and Tea Farmers Suffer Greatly

Taiwan once had the honor of being the "Kingdom of Spices." It had large-scale production of camphor and essential oils, as well as jasmine, gardenia, and other fragrance crops, which were used for large-scale intercropping in the tea industry. The Japanese government's incentives for the tea industry were machine subsidies, fertilizer rationing, variety improvement, and the establishment of training institutes. They also established appraisal meetings for tea plantations in mountainous areas to seek improvements in technology. What was particularly important was that 95% of Oolong tea was sold to Britain and the United States, and they spent 200,000 to 300,000 yuan on advertising in their tea shops every year. At the same time, the bonuses for sales to third countries were as high as 6 million yuan. In 1938 and 1939, when exports exceeded 10 million catties, the subsidy per catty was 7 yuan, and taxes were exempted. The Japanese policy was effective in encouraging the export of Taiwan tea.

Wang Tian Deng, chairman of the Tea Industry Association, and Lin Chao Ming told reporters painfully: "The province could originally produce 20 million catties of tea per year, and the province's consumption was 1 million catties. Recently, it has plummeted to only 4 million catties. The tea farmers in Taipei County and Hsinchu County have abandoned the habit of growing tea for over 80 years (Taiwan's tea trade with Britain and the United States began in 1909). Because of the impact of the war, the tea mountains have all been abandoned. In Taipei alone, over 30,000 people have lost their jobs directly or indirectly. He has repeatedly requested the government to provide incentives, abolish the donations and taxes levied on tea plantations, and think of more ways to improve transportation and planting, but he has not received any concrete results." Then, with a pessimistic attitude, he said: "The farmers have no way to pay taxes, and the abandonment of tea plantations is impossible to reverse in a short time!" The reporter also visited the formerly famous Dadaocheng factory, where only a few workers were picking aged tea next to the stalled machines, and the scene was extremely desolate. They are now working to organize a unified organization for the cultivation, manufacturing, and trade of Taiwan tea, and to establish a tea company jointly run by the government and private sectors to develop the world market, and to establish an evaluation, guidance, and production material purchasing and transportation committee, with a capital of 100 million yuan. It is believed that with the effective cooperation of the government and the private sector, it will be beneficial to the development of Taiwan tea.

### Calamity Invades Rural Jiangxi

— Airmail News, September 18, Our Nanchang Correspondent Liu Zao

The disasters in Jiangxi are truly unspeakable and cannot be fully described. After enduring eight years of banditry, coupled with eight years of war, the people were scattered in foreign lands. After returning after the war, their own houses were burned down by the enemy. Without houses to live in, everyone squeezed into smelly and dirty toilets or under dilapidated eaves to shelter from the wind and rain, lacking clothing and food. In the lean season, the jade-yellow grains in the people's barns were all gone in order to pay military rations. Unable to bear the hunger, they ate Guanyin soil and gnawed on tree bark. Readers are familiar with these tragic realities.

Looking at a dyed map of the disaster area in Jiangxi, the disaster situation in southeastern Jiangxi, although not as severe as in the northwest region, currently has a more severe calamity invading the ravaged rural areas.

Nancheng is a strategic stronghold in southeastern Jiangxi and a transportation hub for Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Fujian. The houses there suffered destruction by the enemy. According to a recent survey report by the county government, a total of over 5,000 buildings were destroyed, accounting for about 90% of the original houses in the city. The returning people had no choice but to build huts on the ruins of tiles and rubble in the unmanned weeds to live in. After the calamity, Nancheng encountered a rat plague, which harmed the lives of many poor people.

Pest infestations and cattle plagues in rural southern Jiangxi, due to the lack of knowledge of farmers and insufficient medical equipment, although farmers in various parts of southern Jiangxi are hoping for a bumper harvest this year, they have unfortunately suffered such unexpected disasters.

The destruction in Ji'an was caused by the enemy's last scavenging battle on the Chinese battlefield on the eve of victory. At that time, the enemy knew that they would suffer a devastating defeat, so the people in the areas they passed through were subjected to the inhuman burning, killing, and destruction by the Japanese devils. As a result, 5,500 houses in Ji'an were burned down, and 2,400 head of cattle were killed.

The northwestern part of Jiangxi is the corner of Jiangxi that has been ravaged by the enemy for the longest time. The city of Gaoan, which straddles the Jinjiang River, was completely destroyed. Weeds and garbage have submerged the original streets. Fengxin, De'an, Shanggao... the entire rural area was reduced to ruins, leaving only a few roofless and doorless dilapidated houses, writing the tragic history of the Japanese devils' atrocities in Jiangxi.

The severity of the disaster in Jiangxi, the people on the hunger line, the current stage of post-disaster relief, in recent days, we have visited the disaster areas and also approached people in the community, listening to general reports, feeling that although Jiangxi's disaster relief work has not yet reached the ideal, there are indeed some facts that show their efforts.

For example: the first phase of emergency rural relief in Nanchang, Xinjian, Yongxiu, and other counties, assisted farmers in resuming cultivation, allowing the returning people with empty hands to have farmhouses to live in and cattle and agricultural tools to help them cultivate, opening up years of barren land, which has solved part of the food problem this year.

The special water conservancy fund of 10 million yuan repaired the long-neglected Ganjiang River dike and various dike gates in the three counties of Nan, Xin, and Yong, completing a total of 282 breaches, 189 dangerous sections, and 100 culvert gates, benefiting a total of 765,520 mu of farmland. It is now also cooperating with the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission Jiangxi District Breach Closure and Dike Restoration Engineering Office to strengthen the restoration of the Ganjiang River and Bin Hu dikes in the form of work relief. According to the Engineering Office's report, the repaired dikes have a length of 27,133,210,050 meters and a volume of 2,365,350 cubic meters of earthwork, benefiting 3,459,620 mu of farmland in the city.

This year, the Ganjiang River has flooded several times, and the highest point of the water level is only a few inches away from the dike surface. The dikes in each section are secured without incident, which is a great help to Jiangxi's bumper harvest this year, and the rural areas have truly received the benefits of relief.

The current relief is focused on the countryside, and the future post-disaster reconstruction is still in the countryside. Because the masses of poor people are in a corner outside the cities, where people are reaching out their hands in need of relief. Director Cai Mengjian talked about Jiangxi's future relief work, saying: "The actual promoters of Jiangxi's relief work are the work teams, and the groups and offices of the branch office are just the 'command post' of this work. Currently, the tasks of the work teams can be divided into six categories based on the most urgent needs: (1) agricultural relief, (2) emergency relief, (3) social welfare, (4) sanitation, (5) flood and drought prevention, and (6) construction of various public buildings." Cai also emphasized the seriousness of the abandonment of farmland in Jiangxi, which should be strengthened through reclamation and recultivation to increase production. Therefore, the branch office has now decided to establish a demonstration farm in the Zhanggongdu area of Yongxiu County, which has the most barren land. The barren land area has already been measured, and 5,000 mu will be developed in the first phase, and it will be expanded to 10,000 mu in the second phase. In the future, the latest type of agricultural tools from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration may be used to carry out this land reclamation work.

Currently, those who are in charge of post-disaster relief work in Jiangxi are encountering several difficult to overcome difficulties: First, there are too few relief materials. The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration originally planned to allocate 15,000 tons of materials to Jiangxi every month, but from November last year to the present, only 10,000 tons of materials have been transported to Jiujiang, which is less than one-tenth of the original budget.

Second, transportation is difficult. The lack of transportation in Jiangxi is currently extremely difficult. By making the most of water and land transportation, the monthly transportation volume is only 5,000 tons, not to mention the rural areas that are not accessible by boat or car, which must rely on manual carrying!

Third, funding has been reduced. The funds approved by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration for Jiangxi were originally 700 million yuan per month, but because the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration itself is experiencing financial difficulties, since August, the funding for the Jiangxi branch has been reduced to 400 million yuan. If the transportation cost of 10,000 tons of materials per month requires 500 million yuan, the total monthly funding of 400 million yuan is not enough for the transportation cost of 10,000 tons of materials. How can we talk about post-disaster reconstruction?

Therefore, the elders of Jiangxi unanimously hope that the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration can allocate more suitable materials to alleviate the current poverty in the countryside and the lives of the 2 million people in need of relief.

### Typhoon Disaster Area

The Trip to Alishan Was Aborted Midway

The reporter arrived in Chiayi in central Taiwan on the 24th and immediately went to Xinying, where the Tainan County Government is located. The reporter stayed overnight in this small town, and just before returning to Chiayi City at 2:00 PM on the 25th, yellow sand had been blowing for several days, making it difficult to open one's eyes. We thought it was the usual gray sand in the south, but when we returned to the city, the radio had issued an emergency warning: "Typhoon hitting Taiwan!"

The typhoon was discovered 200 kilometers off the island on the 24th. People on the island are accustomed to such special products, but they did not expect that it would land in Taitung and the southern tip of Hengchun at a wind speed of 35 meters per second, bringing great terror to the people of the province.

On the morning of the 25th, wind and rain were raging. The reporters squatted in a newly built hotel. The wooden house under Liu Zilin opposite was blown down, and its slender body was also bent over. The top of the building was shaking, and the raindrops outside the window, no matter how tightly you closed the wooden window, still dripped and floated into the room, hitting it hard. In this dangerous building, the reporter thought of his home in Taipei, and his wife and children were probably hugging each other, thinking of their husband traveling south!

The rain stopped for a while, and the wind also temporarily subsided. We prepared to rush to our scheduled route, a trip to the Alishan Forest Area. We arrived at the station of the Taiwan Development Company, and suddenly the rain came again, and the wind speed was stronger and fiercer than before. We did not reduce our courage to go up the mountain, and still took the specially prepared gasoline car and moved forward against the wind. The raindrops hit our cheeks like pieces of ice scars; the wind, the wind blowing from the sea, dragged the gasoline car like a whirlwind, and the driver was paying attention to the brakes with his life. We were soaked all over. We no longer believed the words that there was no risk beyond two stations, and we turned back. According to the stationmaster's report, this was really a risky trip. Uneven stones had fallen from the mountain and blocked the vehicles from moving forward. People often easily sacrifice their lives in this situation. The weather bureau's report was: "The strong typhoon 955 (M·B·) 716 (W·M·) is currently at 19.5 degrees north latitude and 131.5 degrees east longitude, that is, 1,000 kilometers southeast of Okinawa in the sea, moving northwest and approaching Okinawa. The speed of the center's movement is 25 kilometers per hour!"

Emergency Measures

The reporter first visited Lu Guan Qun, president of the China Daily. He said sadly, "It's a drop in the bucket." The typhoon blew away the roof of the newspaper office in the typhoon disaster area. The president's office and the editorial department were flooded to the knees, and you could row a boat. There was no electricity, and the newspaper had not been published for two days. He was dizzy with worry. He said that the China Daily was the most disaster-ridden, but he still mustered all his courage and finally resumed publication on the 28th. The repair costs alone required more than 200,000 Taiwan dollars. For the sake of the newspaper, he had hardly slept since the wind started blowing.

Tainan Mayor Zhuo Gao Xuan issued an emergency announcement one hour after the typhoon stopped, providing free hospital treatment for the injured, reporting deaths for compensation, and sending the homeless to relief homes. In a short time, he obtained several figures: four deaths, the destruction of national schools in central and southern districts of the city, and general crop losses below 50%. In Qigu District, 25 salt workers were swept away by the waves, and the number of missing people was unknown. In Chenggong's mother's home for the elderly, the Kaiyuan Temple, an ancient tree with a history of over 200 years, was cut down by the wind. In Qigu District alone, the losses were over 40 million yuan.

In the southern city of Kaohsiung, boats salvaged by the Port Bureau were washed into the sea by the waves and were salvaged overnight. The factories, schools, and houses destroyed cost more than 20 million yuan. In the county area, sugarcane fields, tobacco seedlings, and sweet potatoes were all destroyed. Sugarcane fields could only preserve seedlings, and over 45,000 mu of rice crops were damaged by more than 40%. However, the locust plague given by nature was extinguished. Nature overcame nature, and humans seemed small and fragile here.

The director of the Tainan Weather Station said that this was an unprecedented disaster in central and southern Taiwan in the past 35 years, but the north and east were just the same. Chief Chen responded to the emergency and allocated 15 million Taiwan dollars, but this was too meager. However, due to the typhoon's attack, it gave a wonderful opportunity for human testing. North-south traffic was restored within 24 hours. The power grid was broken and the substation was broken, but all the lights were turned on in two days. Telephones and telegrams were restored to normal in nine ways. Only the man-made rice price (rising from 13 yuan to 17 yuan per catty) and the soaring price of building materials (tiles rising from four corners to 1.3 yuan) need to be unified and planned by various units.

After the typhoon, another special product fluctuated: two larger earthquakes occurred on the morning of the 28th from about four o'clock to seven thirty, but fortunately there was no damage. The island, nature gives it great hardship!

Weekend Forum

### On the Influence and Improvement of Overseas Chinese Commerce (Part 1)

— Qiu Bincun

I. Introduction

Overseas Chinese residing abroad primarily engage in economic endeavors, with commerce being a major component of these activities. Speaking of commerce, it can be discussed on three levels: (1) Import and export businesses (head) traders (wholesalers), in which the number of Overseas Chinese is not large; (2) Urban secondary (intermediary) traders, in which a large number are run by Overseas Chinese; (3) Rural (tertiary) retail and small purchase traders, in which even more are operated by Overseas Chinese. The influence of Overseas Chinese commerce lies almost entirely in the areas of intermediary trading and retail small purchases. In a word, Overseas Chinese commerce almost entirely occupies the middleman position. This is because Europe, America, and Japan are industrial countries, while China is generally at most a country with fifty percent industry and fifty percent agriculture, and the Nanyang region is an agricultural society. European and American expatriates are only willing to use their capital to engage in upper-level large-scale import and export businesses in order to reap the greatest benefits, and are unwilling to do small businesses piecemeal, wasting time and effort, to pursue minuscule profits. Between Japanese expatriates and the local people, there is also a degree of estrangement. Although Japan was strong after World War I and presumptuously regarded itself as the savior of Southeast Asia, Japanese expatriates and the local people of Nanyang strove to cultivate good relations. Various places did indeed place hope in Japan, but after World War II, Japan completely exposed its deceptive face, and it became difficult for Japanese expatriates to restore their position after Japan's defeat. The knowledge and ability of the local people are also generally considered inferior to those of the Overseas Chinese. Therefore, in the trade between Europe, America, and post-war Japan with Nanyang, it is feared that they will still have to rely on Overseas Chinese as intermediaries. However, precisely because of this, Overseas Chinese commerce in the Nanyang region will inevitably face increased discrimination and competition from the local indigenous people in the future. The latter often have the misconception that Overseas Chinese are hindering their economic development. This can be seen from the recent situations in the Philippines and the Dutch East Indies.

The relationship of Overseas Chinese in Nanyang commerce is an intermediary relationship, and with a large Overseas Chinese population and many hands, Overseas Chinese commerce flourishes and grows in this intermediary role. Professor MacNair of St. John's University in Shanghai stated in his book "The Status and Protection of Overseas Chinese": "The economic status of Overseas Chinese is extremely influential. Based on statistics compiled using Philippine tax revenues, Overseas Chinese control 90% of the retail trade in the Philippines, and they also dominate a large portion of the wholesale trade. European and American merchants can hardly trade with the local people without the intermediation of Overseas Chinese, and as a result, they have to seek assistance from Overseas Chinese. Overseas Chinese engaged in coconut, tobacco, rice, hemp, sugar, alcohol, copra, timber, and sundry goods businesses have often accumulated great wealth." How true these words are! Not only are Overseas Chinese in the Philippines like this, but Overseas Chinese in Siam, Vietnam, Burma, Malaya, and the Dutch East Indies are all the same. However, how Overseas Chinese can maintain their position in the future is a matter for serious research. Here is a brief account of the commercial situation of Overseas Chinese in various Nanyang countries:

II. The Influence of Overseas Chinese Commerce in Various Nanyang Countries

(1) The Influence of Overseas Chinese Commerce in the Philippines

According to a comparative statistic report of the Philippine Department of Agriculture and Commerce in 1932 on Overseas Chinese investment in economic enterprises during the most prosperous period and foreign investment, it is as follows: (Unit: Philippine Pesos in Thousands)

Furthermore, according to the 1938 census statistics of the Philippine government, a comparison of Overseas Chinese and people of various countries engaged in retail businesses is as follows:

From the previous table, it can be seen that the number of retail operators and the amount of capital controlled by Overseas Chinese in the Philippines rank second only to the Philippine nationals, but the total income ranks first, accounting for 58%, Philippine nationals accounting for 38%, Japanese expatriates accounting for 2.65%, while the number of American, Spanish, and Indian expatriates engaged in retail businesses is small. A foreign writer, R. Hayden, said of the economic power of Overseas Chinese in the Philippines, "Overseas Chinese in the Philippines account for 70% to 80% of the retail trade, and three-quarters of the commercial credit in the major islands is controlled by Overseas Chinese. Overseas Chinese supply 40% of the timber retail trade in the outer islands. The total amount of their investment is estimated at US$10 billion, which is equal to half of the US investment in China." Mr. Hayden's claim that Overseas Chinese investment in the Philippines reaches US$10 billion is inevitably an exaggeration, but it shows the great commercial power of Overseas Chinese in the Philippines.

(2) The Influence of Overseas Chinese Commerce in Siam (Thailand)

In Bangkok, Siam, Guangdong (especially Chaozhou and Qiongzhou) expatriates outnumber Fujian expatriates, while in the interior, Minzhangquan expatriates outnumber Yuechaoqiong expatriates, totaling approximately three million people. The main occupation of Overseas Chinese in Siam is commerce, especially retail trade. Most peddlers often penetrate deep into remote mountains and valleys to trade with the local people. The transportation and milling of rice are mostly undertaken by Overseas Chinese. The industries and family handicrafts they operate include machinery, rice milling, sawmills, shipbuilding, textiles, electrical appliances, oil extraction, matches, tobacco, chemical industry, clothing, carpentry, leather, blacksmithing, tinwork, and mining, as well as rubber plantations and miners, and gardeners are also numerous. Siam's exports are mainly rice, teak, tin, and rubber, which are no different from Siam's four treasures, and rice occupies the most important position. Siam cultivates enough food for two years in one year, exporting 25 to 30 million piculs annually, accounting for 70% of the total export value, worth 95 to 100 million baht. In the Buddhist year 2482 (1939), it exported 31.25 million piculs (1,825,027 tons). In the first ten months of 1940, it exported 1,596,973 tons, worth 114,350,000 baht. Tin ranks second among the main products, with an annual output of 160,000 to 260,000 piculs, worth 17 to 30 million baht. In 1938, exports reached 34,030,000 baht. Before the war, the average price per ton in London was £237, which increased to £243 per ton in 1940, so the total value of tin exports from Siam in the first seven months of that year reached 26,030,000 baht. Rubber has only been around for two or thirty years, mostly planted in the south. At the end of 1939, Siam had 85 large rubber plantations, totaling 30,000 rai (Siamese acres). In addition, there are many small rubber plantations, totaling 312,000 rai. In 1938, it produced more than 40,000 tons, with a total export value of 35,120,000 baht. The annual export value of teak is 10 million baht.

According to a 1930 survey, there were 141 Overseas Chinese rice merchants, 84 import and export merchants, 10 insurance companies, 20 timber merchants, 21 machinery merchants, 18 furniture merchants, and 1,335 sundry goods merchants, which can be called extremely prosperous. However, since the Siamese coup in 1932, the so-called new economic policy has been implemented, especially since the military government sang the praises of "nationalism" in 1939, implementing anti-Chinese policies and successively promulgating more than 20 kinds of harsh anti-Chinese regulations, such as Chinese stores must employ 75% Siamese employees, tricycle and barber occupations are limited to Siamese people, and general retailers are gradually operated by Siamese people, etc. At that time, the Siamese government also listened to the plan of Japanese advisor Shinzo Mihara and issued cooperative business bonds in 1940, raising 18 million baht to promote various cooperative businesses, reaching a total of 2,639 units in the first half of 1941. In 1943, the Siamese government established the Ministry of Industry, and all existing industries such as papermaking, cement, brewing, tobacco, matches, sugar, and leather have been expanded. At the same time, chemical drugs, which were previously lacking, have also successively established experimental stations and factories. The entire commerce and economy of Overseas Chinese in Siam gradually entered a period of misfortune. Siam was coerced by Japan in 1942 to declare war on the Allied forces. However, since the official surrender ceremony of the Japanese army in Siam was held on January 11, 1946, Siamese nationalism has also been abolished. On the 23rd of the same month, after the establishment of the Sino-Siamese Friendship Treaty, the Siamese Prime Minister met with Central News Agency reporters on February 7 and said: "The people of the two countries are so similar that they are almost indistinguishable. If you ask any Siamese person on the street, he will surely tell you that his grandfather or great-grandfather was Chinese. How can he feel aversion to his cousins, the Overseas Chinese? Like the United States and other countries, it is easy to delineate Overseas Chinese districts, but the Overseas Chinese in Siam can live anywhere and associate freely with the Siamese people. I believe that the commercial relations between the two countries will be greatly strengthened, because Overseas Chinese merchants account for 80% of all Siamese merchants." Professor MacNair said: "All those who have observed life in Siam know that the prosperity of Siam today is due to the contribution of the Chinese. It is generally acknowledged that the Chinese have injected their wisdom and blood into the Siamese nation, and then the Siamese people have become energetic." It is sincerely hoped that the Siamese nation, which contains Chinese blood, will renew its friendship with the Overseas Chinese, who are known for their diligence, thrift, hard work, law-abidingness, so that they will have the opportunity to develop commerce in Siam, which will also promote the economic trade between China and Siam.

(3) The Influence of Overseas Chinese Commerce in Vietnam

The Overseas Chinese in Vietnam originate from Guangdong, Fujian, Chaozhou, Hakka, Guangzhou, and Yunnan, Guangxi, etc., numbering approximately 400,000 people. Among them, those residing in Cochinchina account for 52%, Cambodia accounts for 33%, Tonkin accounts for 11%, Annam accounts for 3%, and Laos accounts for 1%. The Overseas Chinese who initially arrived in Vietnam were mostly without material possessions, relying only on their commercial talent and frugality to accumulate small capital, engage in peddling, and gradually become large merchants. From the 17th century onwards, Overseas Chinese have controlled the entire commerce of Vietnam. Vietnam uses raw materials to exchange for manufactured goods in the international market. Its products include rice, rubber, fish, livestock, hides, coal, zinc, tin, iron, iron alum, manganese, tungsten, and phosphates. Imports include cotton, silk, hardware, kerosene, and automobiles. Although Vietnam produces cotton, it is not self-sufficient, importing 95% annually, worth 249 million francs. According to the exchange rate of 1 piastre to 2 gold francs in 1933, it is 498 million francs per year (before 1932, each piastre was equal to 2 francs and 32 centimes). According to the statistics of 1935: In Vietnam's exports, food products accounted for 72.1%, and raw materials accounted for 24.9%; in imports, finished products accounted for 65.8%, and raw materials accounted for 34.2%. This is its economic feature.

France's influence entered Vietnam, taking the Saigon Treaty of 1862, which formally occupied Cochinchina, as a turning point, and in 1885, it controlled Cochinchina, Cambodia, Tonkin, Annam, Laos, and all of Annam, and in 1891, it formed a federation, completely completing its rule. Before and after France completely ruled Vietnam, all interactions between France and the local people mainly relied on Overseas Chinese as assistants. The Vietnamese retained the exclusionary ideology of the five dynasties and avoided contact with Westerners. Therefore, France on the one hand granted Overseas Chinese the right to undertake the collection of indirect taxes. The sale and taxation of salt, alcohol, and opium were all handled by Overseas Chinese. Later, because this right was so profitable, it was taken over by the French administrative office for sale, but due to the opposition of Overseas Chinese, the French side made concessions, nominally managed by officials, but the real power was still in the hands of Overseas Chinese. On the other hand, the French President ordered in 1897 to divide Asians (in fact, almost all Overseas Chinese) into six classes, paying an annual head tax or personal tax (Impot persoanl) ranging from a minimum of 10 piastres to 400 piastres. Vietnamese people only paid 2 piastres, while European and American expatriates were exempt, which was an unfair and harsh tax.

In general commerce, the French used Overseas Chinese as intermediaries for their transactions with the local people, thus forming a comprador (broker) profession for Overseas Chinese. The most influential ones were bank compradores. French banks could not lend money without the signature of an Overseas Chinese comprador. In addition, there were trade compradores; import compradores provided foreign goods to the local people, and export compradores purchased local goods from local producers for export, taking a commission in the process.

The economy of Vietnam can be said to be completely in the hands of Overseas Chinese: the largest of these is the rice milling industry, including millet, chili peppers, mountain goods, and other miscellaneous grains and their transactions. Rice milling factories and their export industries are mostly concentrated in Cholon City, near Saigon. According to a 1932 survey, Chinese people opened 75 rice milling factories, while French people opened only 3. Rice millers are engaged in the sale and export of white rice. Rice merchants and exporters rarely buy rough rice themselves, because there are many merchants who specialize in rough rice. This item is also monopolized by Overseas Chinese. The second is the cotton industry, where Overseas Chinese also hold almost the same position as in the rice industry, but due to the strong French capital and competition, since 1930, the cotton industry has been seized by French capital. The third is sugar. Overseas Chinese also occupy a monopoly position in sugar production. All purchases and loans of sugarcane, as well as the operation of sugar factories, are concentrated in the hands of Overseas Chinese. The center of the sugar industry is in Chaudoc, where Overseas Chinese operate more than 20 factories. Overseas Chinese operate four-fifths of the other sugar factories in Vietnam. Other businesses such as rubber, building materials, shipping, transportation, foreign goods, market industry (slaughtering meat, vegetables), spices, tea, silk, and rattan goods are also all in the hands of Overseas Chinese. In addition, there are many retail merchants and merchants. Outside of commerce, the power of Overseas Chinese in other enterprises is weak. In the mining industry, although Overseas Chinese were the pioneers, the French seized it because the development was too large, and the power of Overseas Chinese is very weak.

Businesses now in the hands of the French include: (1) electricity, (2) shipbuilding yards, (3) large factories, (4) trams, (5) automobiles, (6) brewing, (7) opium. In addition, the financial capital, the economic lifeline of Overseas Chinese, is required by the French government to be deposited in the Bank of France, so the entire economic lifeline of Overseas Chinese is completely under French control.

On September 22, 1940, the Japanese army entered Vietnam without a fight. Under the direction of the French-Vietnamese Governor-General, the Overseas Chinese economic organizations—grain and rice, consignment and storage industry, bread, alcohol affairs, slaughter industry, vegetable merchants, shipbuilding, grain milling, grain milling Chinese workers, tailoring, dressmaking, Western clothing, silk industry workers, women's sewing, hat-making commerce, embroidery, women's cotton weaving, lumberyards, bricks and tiles, stoves, glass, glass jars, wooden furniture, used furniture, rattanware, bamboo ware, candles and soap, pengguan merchants, machinery union, iron merchants, industry, shoemaking, carriages, printing merchants, printing, lithography, foreign goods merchants, barbering, women's virtue, women's reading, photography, music, and other 56 units, guilds, trade unions, and other social groups were all closed and disbanded. All movable and immovable property of all Overseas Chinese organizations was also completely confiscated and auctioned off. The proceeds were allocated to charitable organizations in the localities where the groups were located as charitable donations. The economic losses of the Overseas Chinese were very large. Japan surrendered, the Allied forces won, and the land of Vietnam was restored. Especially since the signing of the Sino-French Equality Treaty on February 28 of this year, Vietnam should improve the economic activities of Overseas Chinese.

### To Whom Do We Complain? The Blood and Tears of "Golden Rugao"

— Our Zhenjiang, September 18th Dispatch by Wang Han'ou

In northern Jiangsu, "Golden Rugao," what a magnificent and seductive term this is. But this place has been suffering from disasters since the Anti-Japanese War, and has been kneaded into something worse than scrap metal.

As early as the spring of the 27th year of the Republic, the Japanese invaders landed on the riverbank in Nantong and rushed towards Rugao and Dongtai. When in Nantong, the cruelty of the enemy was not so severe, but after passing Nantong, the situation changed. Burning, killing, raping, and looting were carried out without any scruples. Therefore, the people of Rugao endured the most unbearable period.

A Series of Oppressive Policies

The whole city was filled with wailing ghosts and howling dogs, and there was no peace. After a few months, in order to transfer troops and shorten the defense line, the Japanese devils withdrew from Dongtai and Yancheng, but they did not give up Rugao alone. Because the Japanese ronin and pro-Japanese traitors, they all believed that "Golden Rugao" still had blood and marrow to suck, so they insisted on not letting go and continued to exploit it. Then, the guerrillas counterattacked the city, and the Japanese devils burned civilian houses at the four city gates, making many people homeless. When the Wang Jingwei "government" was established, the political line was completely focused on kidnapping the god of wealth and extorting money, and they suffered more than seven years of occupation crimes. The people of Rugao paid their blood and flesh little by little in the midst of humiliation and endurance. After finally waiting for the victory of the Anti-Japanese War and the hope of peace, another set of "Liberation War" cannons came, and countless innocent people inside and outside the city were sacrificed. After the place was "liberated," the people of Rugao longed for the restoration of their normal lives in the future; but the facts disappointed them. The "Liberation Zone government" not only did not grant them democracy and freedom, but also brought "revolution," struggle, and reckoning, a series of oppressive policies that were frantically launched like wildfire. As a result, the propertied class declined, the propertyless class became unemployed, and all industry and commerce became "publicly owned." Those who could still steal a bowl of humiliating food in the past could not even do that now. The unfortunate people of Rugao began to need to complain, but to whom do they complain?

Struggling on the Edge of Death

The people of Rugao suffered such great pain that they were said to have transformed their lives and been reborn until the government recovered Rugao. But they still could not escape the threat of war. Around it, there were several earth-shattering battles in Dingnian, Yanghuaqiao, and Fenjie, which were all launched by the Communist army in the so-called "strategic situation." In Guitou Street and Xie San Guan Ting in Dingnian, such eerie places, the Communist army launched a siege of tens of thousands of people, and once announced the capture of Wang Tiehan, commander of the 49th Division of the National Army. However, as a result, Commander Wang was not captured, but it itself suffered tens of thousands of casualties. Those dead bodies lay in the fields and ditches, gradually rotting and stinking. Wherever you went, you could still faintly smell the stench of decaying corpses. After six days and seven nights of bloody battles in Yanghuaqiao and Songjiazhuang, there was not a single intact house, nor a complete field of crops. All the residents' possessions were destroyed. Everyone died or fled. Even now, there are still many people who have not dared to run back to take a look at their destroyed homes. In Fenjie, the shells from both sides poured down like taro and radishes. It is pitiful that those "rush! rush!" "militia" and "armed work teams" were buried here confusedly.

The Ancient City Has Lost Its Luster.

The National Army entered the city, and the war came to an end. Everyone hoped that traffic would gradually resume and commercial activities would slowly recover; however, the Communist army, scattered in the four suburbs, began to move again after being reorganized and supplemented, and they also received reinforcements from the north. They chose the weakest stronghold on the highway - Dingnian, Baipu, and counterattacked. This time, the regular troops and traffic police of the National Army gave them a strong blow, and successively annihilated nearly 10,000 people, but the traffic in Dingnian was finally cut off temporarily, and Rugao City became a situation of being surrounded on three sides. Here we should thank the ancient city of Rugao. This old-century building has miraculously protected the safety of the residents in the city. During the day, the Communist army, fearing aerial reconnaissance, hid in the sorghum fields and dared not move. At night, "rush! rush!" they could not climb up the city. This ancient city hugged the people in the city like a nanny. The calmness and determination of the troops stationed in the city left the Communist army with no other choice but to tightly surround and blockade the city, restricting the entry of rice and grass. It is pitiful that the people in the city cannot even eat a little vegetable at the moment. Many poor people simply rely on the relief flour that entered the city in the first batch last time to survive. Observing the recent situation, the Communist army's planned counterattacks on several towns have not been successful, and Rugao City is certainly out of the question. However, the relief of Rugao will probably still take some time, because there are too many early-grain fields in that area, which are very conducive to the Communist army's hiding. When the sorghum and corn are harvested, and the National Army's reinforcements have cleared the highway, the Communist army will have no way to hide and move in the nearby countryside, and their counterattack will completely collapse.

### "Open Killing" Case in Northern Jiangsu

— Yangzhou Dispatch, September 16th, by our special correspondent Wang Gonghan

The sensational Li Wen assassination case, covered as a "headline news" special edition in various newspapers, is significant. But shouldn't the "open killing" of thousands upon thousands of ordinary people's lives also be considered news?

Let's start with the situation before January:

"Jiangdu, 29th Dispatch: Communist troops near the Goddess Temple in Yangzhou launched a small-scale harassment today, possibly a prelude to a large-scale offensive. Also, in the southwest area of Shaobo Lake, Communist troops have been active recently. According to refugees who escaped from Shaobo, Qiaomo, and other places, Communist troops are carrying out large-scale massacres in these areas. Those deemed 'pro-government' people, including women and children, are not spared. In Liujiazhuang alone, the number reached over three hundred. The methods of killing are appalling. One person, after being arrested, was thrown into a dung pit, submerged for half an hour, then pulled out and forced to wear cotton clothes under the blazing sun. This was repeated, and the victim screamed until he died. The Communist troops took pleasure in this."

Naked Escape

This is the second such incident this month. The first was between the 13th and 15th, when Communist troops from Shaobo and Gaoyou launched attacks and disturbances in the Huxi (west of Gaoyou Lake) area. The people in Songjia Bridge and Lingtang Bridge in the seventh district of Gaoyou County, as well as Gongdao Bridge in the eighth district of Jiangdu County, suffered even more severely at the hands of the Communist troops. At the time, people who escaped from these areas to Yangzhou recounted, "The entire town of Gongdao Bridge originally had over two hundred households, with a population of about one thousand people, counting five people per household. After two days of massacre and widespread escape, truly not a chicken or dog remained. Even elderly people over sixty, who had never left their hometown for many years (including during the Japanese occupation), were forced to flee this time. As a result, summing up several places, about five thousand people fled their hometowns to Yangzhou (a previous newspaper reported fifty thousand, which was a mistake). In Lianxing Temple in the northern suburbs of Yangzhou alone, over six hundred people were taken in. Most of them were shirtless, and their accounts completely convinced me of the truth. Most of them escaped at night, and in their haste to flee, they didn't even have time to put on a jacket. There were even some who reportedly escaped completely naked because, habitually, in the hot nights, they often slept without trousers."

Slashing, Beheading, Exposure and Drowning

In one family, ten out of eleven members were brutally murdered by the Communist troops. The one who survived escaped over the back wall. The methods of the atrocities included tying up several children and throwing them into the river to die. There were also three other different methods. One was "exposure to the sun" as mentioned in the earlier telegram. The others were "waist chop" and "neck cut."

What is "waist chop"? It is using an old-fashioned large guillotine-like "cutting frame" to cut a person in half at the waist.

What is "neck cut"? "Neck cut" is using an ordinary kitchen knife to cut the person's neck as if cutting a rope.

People in Yangzhou will tell you the same if you ask them. Great thinkers, great scientists, and great religious figures of the world all say, "Human beings have innate great desires, the first of which is health and the preservation of life…" So how can people not care about and be aware of such unfortunate events that might befall them?

A Cry from the Heart

Without asking what crime the people committed by being "pro-government," I feel before ending this dispatch: For the precarious lives of the people of Northern Jiangsu, for the meaning of all human lives, I must make a desperate cry for survival. At the same time, I want to lodge a complaint against the current laws of the country—the tragic killing of one or two people is a "criminal case," and the perpetrator is guilty of "murder." But when the lives of hundreds and thousands of people are openly killed simultaneously, where is our law? The lives of "important people" should be valued more, but are the lives of ordinary people not lives in the eyes of the law, in the innate right to survive?

Please do not think that my cry is too high-pitched, nor that this is an unnecessary subjective opinion from a news reporter. This is the cry from the bottom of the hearts of every good person in Northern Jiangsu.

Finally, I would also like to invite everyone to practice a song. It was the most popular song during the early days of the War of Resistance against Japan, "Defend Dawu Dam": "Arise, compatriots! They killed our parents! They killed our brothers! Arise, compatriots! They killed our sisters! They killed our wives and children! Arise, compatriots!…" After reviewing this song, what is churning in your mind? As a news reporter, oh, I can't bear to say it anymore!

### Looking North to Home, Where Flames of War Rage and Floods Surge - Northern Jiangsu Refugees Sit or Lie on Coffins - Separated from the Dead by Only One Wall

— Zhenjiang Dispatch, 4th, Wang Han'ou

"Autumn wind, autumn rain, sadden one to death." At this time, in this scene, probably only the displaced refugees of Northern Jiangsu can intimately experience this. Their homes have been destroyed, people are displaced outside, in the bleak autumn wind, looking north to their hometowns, where flames of war rage and floods surge... Countless sorrows gather in their hearts, they never thought, after one year of national rejoicing and celebrating the victory of restoration, they are still enduring the suffering of displacement!

In Zhenjiang, the displaced refugees huddled in shelters and wandering in the streets are particularly numerous compared to other cities in the Jiangnan region. Zhenjiang is the capital of Jiangsu Province and also a transportation hub connecting the north and south of the Yangtze River. The refugees come to Zhenjiang as soon as they arrive; Zhenjiang is their natural nanny. Here, they not only escape the terror of "struggle" but also receive warmth and relief. In this way, Zhenjiang accommodates thousands of refugees, and there are dozens of shelters, reception centers, county-level relief associations, and relief stations inside and outside the city. Under the auspices of the provincial government authorities and the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, they have rescued a large number of refugees who have fled from Northern Jiangsu. The reporter went to visit a shelter. This is a mountain villa belonging to a certain provincial guildhall. Many coffins of fellow provincials are floating in the dim room, coffins of dead people. Next to the coffins, however, are rows of bedding for the refugees, with many men, women, old and young sitting and lying down.

Some are families of several, others are just single men. Their haggard faces are etched with traces of their suffering. They have been fleeing for several months, and everything they owned has been eaten into their stomachs. Now, they almost all rely on relief flour, using it to make gruel every day to solve their hunger. Although they are so distressed, they still endure peacefully. Each of them has an endless tale of suffering. As soon as you ask him or her, they will immediately pour out their hearts to you. The first thing they say is "How terrible!" "How terrible!" Then they tell many shocking and cruel stories. Finally, they point to the coffin and say to the reporter: "Sir, you see, now we live in this pitiful place, separated from the dead by a wall, but we don't feel afraid. Thinking about being at home, it was really separated from the dead by a wall, with the danger of losing our lives at any time!"

The composition of these refugees is mostly from the middle class and literate intellectuals. From their arduous and serious exile, it can be seen that they have not lost the hardworking nature of the people of Northern Jiangsu. They help to build roads, dig mud and carry stones in the mountains, chop firewood for farmers, doing all kinds of hard labor, taking the lowest meager wages—the lowest wage is only five or six hundred yuan per day. Recently, several sections of roads in Zhenjiang have been completed with the help of refugees. Every day they run to the relief station to look at the announcements: "A certain agency is recruiting one hundred stokers," "A certain station is recruiting eighty road workers," This is the little work they might get and a little hope to improve their living standards.

In the newspaper district of Zhongshan Road in the city, seven or eight local newspapers are posted on the wall. This is where refugees gather every morning. From seven o'clock to ten o'clock, the area is crowded with people. They are looking for news from their hometowns, watching and talking about the war situation. As they watch, they see hope. A large area of Huaiyin and Huainan has been recovered by the National Army, and they have the opportunity to be protected and return to their hometowns. Then they look at the news from the hometown associations. Dozens of relief association announcements from Huaian, Huaiyin, Suining, Siyang, are posted on the wall, telling them where to register, providing travel expenses to send them back home. "Where is your registration office?" "Shall we go together?" Everyone talks and says, full of energy. But there are still some places in Northern Jiangsu that have not been recovered by the National Army. Although there are also announcements from the relief associations of various counties, also calling them to go to the office to register and prepare for the return home procedures, those refugees say with worry: "Will there be a solution soon? The Communists are trying to delay again." The autumn wind is rising, and the facilities in the refugee shelters are somewhat incapable of shielding them from the wind and rain, and warm clothing has become a problem. Looking longingly at the bountiful autumn harvest in Northern Jiangsu, they are really looking forward to returning home!

### The Labor Movement in Japan

— Tokyo Special Dispatch, 2nd, by our special correspondent Chuan Junyi

The development process of the labor movement in Japan after the war can be divided into three periods: The first period was from the Japanese surrender to the end of last year. During this period, the Dai Nippon Sangyo Hokokukai (Greater Japan Industrial Patriotic Association), a tool of the Japanese military, was dissolved. The leaders of the Labor Union General Federation led by Komakichi Matsuoka of the Socialist Party, and the National Council of Trade Unions, held an expanded preparatory meeting of the central labor organizations on January 3, deciding to temporarily focus on the formation of various trade union units. The Communist Party also held a national party congress on November 8 last year, at which it was decided to adopt a common struggle policy with the Socialist Party's Labor Union General Federation, and at the same time independently organize various associations. Thus, under the leadership of these two factions, Japan's labor movement unfolded organized activities. The characteristic of this period was that the various trade unions had no organizational ties, and the demands were mostly economic, such as increasing wages and recognizing trade unions.

The second period was from last year to February of this year. During this period, the preparatory committee of the All Japan Federation of Industrial Trade Unions, led by the Communist Party, established various trade unions at the end of February. These unions were horizontally combined based on regional and capital system distinctions. The main demands were to require employers to sign collective bargaining agreements and participate in production and management.

The third period is from February of this year to the present. The characteristic of this period is that the form of struggle has gradually changed from the economic sphere to the political sphere, mainly to overthrow the Yoshida Cabinet. At the same time, because the government stopped the wartime subsidy policy, and because a large number of factories have been designated as reparations items, resulting in reduced productivity, a large number of unemployed reserve army will be generated. Therefore, the current goal of the struggle is to require that all employed workers must be employed.

Rising and Falling of Labor Strikes

In terms of the ups and downs of labor strikes, according to statistics released by the Ministry of Health and Welfare: labor strikes in February and March were between 100 and 130, while in April and May they increased to between 150 and 165. From the Japanese surrender to the end of May, a total of 1,130 labor strikes occurred, involving 918,000 workers. After June, labor strikes gradually decreased, totaling 155, and decreased again to 101 in July. The main reason was the distribution of a large amount of food rations by MacArthur. However, there has been a gradual increase in the trend recently. Although the recent labor strikes of the National Railway Workers and Seamen have been resolved, opinions within the trade unions have not yet been unified, and at the same time, the newspaper workers are also brewing a strike. Furthermore, in terms of the industrial sectors where labor strikes occur, in the first five months of this year, among the 663 labor strikes, the machinery and tool industry accounted for 174, about 25% or more, coal mines accounted for 98, accounting for 14% or more, transportation accounted for 96, the metal industry accounted for 46, and sawmills accounted for 42. Labor strikes are mostly concentrated in these industries because the working-class consciousness in these industries is stronger. Furthermore, in terms of region, Tokyo and Hokkaido have the most labor strikes, while Osaka and Fukuoka, which are industrial centers, have fewer.

Two Major Factions

As mentioned above, the labor movement in Japan is now led by two major factions. One is the Labor Union General Federation led by the Socialist Party, and the other is the All Japan Federation of Industrial Trade Unions led by the Communist Party. The former has 800,000 members, and the latter has 1.3 million members. Laborers participating in trade union organizations total 3 million, and the members participating in these two organizations total 2.1 million. The other 900,000 people take a neutral attitude. The chairman of the General Federation is Komakichi Matsuoka, who served as a councilor of the National Spiritual Mobilization Headquarters and a special commissioner for military protection during the war. Some people compare him to William Green of the United States, while they compare Katsumi Kikutami, the chairman of the All Japan Federation of Industrial Trade Unions, to Philip Murray. The character of the All Japan Federation of Industrial Trade Unions is to deny capitalism and advocate that workers in various industries take unified action, using common struggle methods to advance from economic struggle to political struggle. The General Federation's policy is based on economic struggle as a principle. In this National Railway Workers' strike, the attitude of the Socialist Party was very clear, not supporting the workers in carrying out strikes, fearing that the strike would turn into a political struggle. At the same time, the Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, Suehiro Nishio, declared at the Second Party Congress on the 28th: He regards the General Federation's strike as a weapon and advocates that all party policies should be realized through Parliament. At the same time, at the inaugural meeting of the All Japan Federation of Industrial Trade Unions on August 19, it was decided that trade unions should be guaranteed the freedom to support political parties, and to unify the labor front from the bottom up through common struggle, in other words, to accept the leadership of the Communist Party.

Employer Offensive

Due to these significant differences in political views, there is no hope of unification. With the surge of the labor movement, the employer's offensive has gradually strengthened. The Labor Relations Adjustment Act recently passed in Parliament can be said to be the first step in the employer's offensive against labor. The Socialist Party, the Communist Party, and other minority parties strongly opposed it in Parliament, but because the Liberal and Progressive parties approved it, it was finally passed by Parliament. This regulation stipulates that employees of public utility enterprises may not strike arbitrarily, and at the same time stipulates that strikes may not be carried out for less than 30 days during the mediation period. Government officials and civil servants are also not allowed to strike. At the same time, the Economic Stabilization Board believes that the current labor-management disputes are mostly political in nature and may develop into a movement to overthrow the cabinet. It advocates the establishment of a Labor-Management Consultation Council, inviting labor, management, and third parties to participate. Powerful employer groups, such as the Economic Doyukai (Committee for Economic Development), have recently issued statements on the current labor-management disputes, advocating labor-management coordination to achieve corporate rationalization, opposing the government's massive layoffs, and implementing the rationalization of enterprises. However, workers should not arbitrarily oppose layoffs, and should implement the rationalization of production and management through a management consultation council organized by labor and management. This association is composed of important figures from the Kansai financial community and is a political economic organization. It goes without saying that the statement on labor-management issues issued by the association represents the powerful opinions of the employers. Recently, Shinji Iwamoto, Director of the Research Bureau of the Bank of Japan, told a reporter from the Asahi Shimbun: From now on, Japanese enterprises should be managed with the participation of both labor and management, so he believes that the establishment of an economic consultation council is necessary, but the direct participation of workers in planning has the potential to be politically exploited.

Trade Union Policy

The biggest shortcoming of the current Japanese labor organization is the weakness of organizational leadership. For example, during the food demonstration on May 20, the Tokyo branch of the National Railway Workers' Union actually ordered each branch to force free rides to participate in the parade, which was prohibited by the Eighth Army authorities. Kazuo Okochi, a professor of social policy at Tokyo University and an expert in social policy, said in his booklet "Social Policy After the War": Since the Meiji Restoration, the Japanese working class has lacked autonomy in spirit.

The capitalist's self-profit-seeking position has limits. Therefore, engineers, management leaders, workers, and representatives of all levels related to management should jointly participate in management, abandoning the capitalist profit-seeking management model and adopting a productivity-centered overall management model. This is the socialization of management and can also be said to be the democratization of management. However, the Japanese Trade Union Law only focuses on the first task. Japanese trade unions should realize these two tasks in one fell swoop. More unfortunately, the Japanese working class is not yet mature in the training to implement these two tasks. This is the tragedy of the Japanese trade union movement.

### The Future of Women's Liberation

— Yan Haoying

The women's movement has been around for a long time, but it's only in the thirty or forty years since the beginning of the twentieth century that it has shown its true power. In the past, women's movements were too fragmented and unorganized, merely individual activities of a few intellectual women rather than a collective movement of women as a whole. Their policies often leaned towards local improvements while neglecting fundamental solutions. It is only now that the women's movement is progressing in an organized manner, and the solution lies in a glorious future.

An important trend in the women's movement is the shift from seeking happiness for a few women to seeking happiness for all women, and from the leadership of activities by a few intellectual women to the participation of all oppressed women in the struggle.

Secondly, the focus of its development will be on economic liberation. This is because, from the perspective of social evolution, the economic system has a very important impact on human life. All the oppression suffered by women is entirely caused by the economic system of male patriarchal society. Women's sexual and political subordination are merely the results of economic subordination. Therefore, the key to women achieving sexual and political liberation still lies in economic liberation.

Opening the doors of social occupations to allow women to participate cannot be seen as evidence that women have achieved economic liberation. It is only a step towards achieving economic liberation. Economic oppression exists in society just as it does in the family. Women lacking training in skills and eager to obtain work become objects of oppression. Just as when women enter the workforce, they often take on tedious and even sordid jobs that are poorly paid and take up a lot of time. They can hardly support themselves with their wages, and the heavy workload wears down their physical health.

Although the entry of modern women into the workforce is partly due to the advocacy and promotion of women's movement activists, it is mostly driven by the general trend of the Industrial Revolution. At this time, scientific inventions have not yet fully reformed the family. Women rush into society in the urgent tide of life, are incorporated into the organization of production, and the responsibilities of the family still bind their hands and feet, not allowing them a moment of rest. After gaining formal liberation, women simultaneously shoulder the responsibilities of household management, social production, and even racial reproduction. This excessive labor is not adequately compensated, and it reveals to current women's movement activists that the transformation of family organization cannot be ignored while developing women's careers. The liberation of women should take all aspects into account: if women leave the family to serve society, then household chores must be simplified; if women invest in social production organizations, then treatment and compensation must be improved to avoid becoming a new form of oppression for women; and although women seek economic independence from social occupational life, they still bear the responsibility for the survival of the race, so society should do what it can to develop their maternal instincts in good conditions.

In conclusion, we can conclude that the future development of the women's movement must pay attention to the following three things:

First, national protection. The main method of national protection is to formulate women's labor laws. Currently, many countries have paid attention to this issue due to the urging of women's movement activists. Although it remains to be seen whether this new legislation will bring real benefits to women, depending on the sincerity of employers, there is hope for future development. Currently, many countries are focusing on the following when formulating women's labor laws: abolishing night work, reducing working hours; increasing compensation, stipulating minimum wages; prohibiting the employment of women in heavy and dangerous work; protecting maternity, stipulating that pregnant women have several weeks of leave before and after childbirth, with wages paid as usual, or without wages but with a maternity allowance, and so on.

Second, the socialization of housework. To prevent household chores from becoming an obstacle to women's social development, they should be taken out of women's hands and entrusted to society for management. This is a very interesting attempt, and the progress of science will make this attempt a kind of progress that many modern people dare not imagine. Apart from the Soviet Union and the United States, many countries have not yet dared to try the socialization of housework. However, according to the current trend, women will eventually break away from the "realm of the family" and become a member of society. The Soviet Union has transferred all the duties of the family to the state in the rapid changes of society, making it a public matter. In the United States, due to the development of social undertakings, household chores have gradually been taken over by a part of society and become a commercial organization. Although the methods of these two are different, they show a common point, that is, general housework is handled by society instead of the former housewives. In the future, what will adorn the new construction of society will be public lodgings, public laundries, public dining rooms, public entertainment rooms or entertainment venues, etc.; only then will women be completely free people, and in addition to working for society like men, they will no longer have to be managers of men's household chores.

Third, public childcare. The education of children is also a kind of housework. I am separating it out here only to show its importance. The most important duty of women in the family is childcare. When the women's occupational liberation movement began, men's insistence on opposition was based on this reason. However, since the progress of scientific knowledge such as educational psychology, it is known that public childcare institutions specially set up by society to replace maternal management and education of children are not only beneficial in terms of hygiene and health, but also have great social value in terms of children's psychological concepts. This coincides with the demands of women's liberation. The popularity of modern kindergartens and nurseries has opened up the beginning of the public childcare movement. When the public childcare system is realized, the social liberation of women will be almost completely unproblematic.

In short, we can assert that when the women's problem is solved, it will be the time when inequality and oppression are eliminated in mankind. At that time, the world unfolding before us will have complete freedom and equality.

### American Women Bring Children to Attend Election Meetings

### Children's Teeth

— Guo Chang

If there were two children standing in front of you, the first child's teeth are neat and white, and the second child's teeth are very uneven, yellow, and have bad breath, which one would you like? Of course, from the appearance, the second child will undoubtedly leave you with a bad impression.

The neatness and health of teeth are really based on the attention and protection of parents during childhood. If parents do not pay attention during childhood, then their future teeth arrangement must be messy and prone to decay, which will cause lifelong regrets for their children.

Teeth are part of the bone tissue of the human body. Generally speaking, its exterior is surrounded by hard enamel, and inside the enamel is softer dentin. The center of the tooth is nerves and blood vessels. If bacteria invade the teeth, they are very easy to decay. Therefore, wise parents should take care of their children's teeth when they are young. Fathers often do not have time to take care of their children because they are busy with work outside, so mothers should take up this responsibility. The following are several rules for protecting teeth, hoping to earnestly teach children to do them:

(1) Cultivate good habits for children to brush their teeth early in the morning and before going to bed, because if they do not brush their teeth, the decaying food in the crevices of their teeth will easily breed bacteria, which will decay their teeth, hinder digestion, and eventually lead to gastrointestinal diseases.

(2) During childhood, permanent teeth are just forming, so do not let them bite hard fruits and excessively hot or cold food, so as not to damage the enamel and dental nerves.

(3) Children love sweets the most, so make sure they eat less.

(4) Give them more food rich in calcium, such as peanuts, bamboo shoots, and grains. Because the majority of teeth are composed of calcium, if the human body lacks calcium, it will draw calcium from the teeth to supplement it, and the teeth will decay. Therefore, calcium should be supplemented frequently.

(5) If there is a sudden toothache that lasts for a few seconds and then stops, you should immediately consult a good dentist, because this is often a sign that the tooth is about to decay.

(6) If a tooth has decayed into a hole, do not remove it arbitrarily, because after random removal, the nearby teeth will often become loose and easily fall out. You should try to repair it as much as possible.

(7) When deciduous teeth fall out at the age of six or seven, you should consult a good dentist to avoid the messy arrangement of permanent teeth in the future.

(8) Rinse your mouth after eating.

(9) Do not put your fingers in your mouth, because there are many bacteria on your fingers, which not only easily decay your teeth, but also easily transmit other diseases.

The above nine points are simple and easy to implement. Just need parents to pay a little attention to their children, then the foundation of their children's lifelong happiness, beauty, and health can be laid from a young age.

### The Use of Eggs in Cosmetology

— Yu Renfeng

We all know that eggs are a useful treasure because they contain a lot of protein, not only delicious, but also a necessary and large-scale need in industry and medicine. Now I want to mention its two uses in cosmetology, which cannot but be said to be its side effects.

First, we feel the importance of the "face" to life, especially for women. A middle-aged woman with several children has wrinkles on her face that are almost like an old woman. How can such a chicken-skin face be pleasing? This should be treated with this method: first put an egg (yolk and white) in a teacup, mix and stir it with brown sugar, wait for it to solidify, then slowly pour some water on it to make it smooth, and that's considered successful. (But you must carefully and slowly chop up the clotted brown sugar with force to avoid impurities mixing in it and scratching your skin.) Then, you treat it as soap for washing your face (or even simpler, just add a small amount of water without brown sugar). When washing your face or bathing, use your hands to scoop some into your palm and rub it evenly, from your face to your chest. At this time, you become an Abyssinian warrior, but don't laugh, because when you laugh, the muscles of your face will move, which is not good. So, if you are bathing at this time, please continue to wash, and just when you are finished washing, the medicine (so to speak) on your face may be about to dry. At this time, your face will feel tight, but don't panic. After it dries, slowly wash it off with warm water, and you will find how smooth and jade-like your face is!

Second, the egg shampoo method is the best way to protect and repair hair. If you can do it constantly, it will not only make your hair look extraordinarily shiny and beautiful, but also not easy to fall out. That is, the night before you prepare to shampoo, first wash your hair with water until it is clean and remove the dirt, then wash it again with pure and high-quality hair oil. After that, beat two eggs (both yolk and white) into a prepared basin, and use both hands to fully rub and wash from the scalp to the ends of the hair. At the scalp, comb with a comb or scratch with your fingertips; in the middle and ends of the hair, you can hold and rub it with both hands. If you can wash it four or five times, then wash it off with water. As long as you can do this, from youth to old age, the hair will not easily turn white, and even if it turns white, the hair will be very moist, giving people a sense of beauty. Women are prone to hair loss after childbirth. If you use this method, you can avoid it. These are all true experiences, so don't take it lightly.

### The Static Beauty Between Husband and Wife

— Chen Tianduo

On the road or in the park, we often see many newly married couples, hand in hand, heads bowed and necks close, talking sweet nothings. Indeed, newlywed life is the sweetest, but when we turn to look at the daily newspapers, the number of divorces is also constantly increasing. They fail to maintain the static beauty within the hearts of the husband and wife after marriage and taste the bitterness of love, so a Western proverb says: "Love can create comedy, and also create tragedy"; a French ballad says: "The joy of love vanishes in an instant, the pain of love lingers in the heart forever"; even now some people are singing: "Marriage is the tomb of love." These are all caused by not understanding how to pursue the supreme art of life and how to maximize the static beauty hidden deep within the heart.

The so-called inner beauty refers to the English Inner-Manner. Human beings have two kinds of distinctions: outer-manner (Oeet-Manner) and inner-manner (Inner-Manner). Outer-manner, such as physical satisfaction, material enjoyment, and the pursuit of fame and fortune, cannot outweigh the real needs of the inner soul. Static beauty is a kind of inner beauty. Suppose a husband comes home from work every day, feeling quite tired, at this time, he needs some light and quiet comfort to regulate and compensate for his boring and heavy work during the day, but the wife insists on not being aware of the situation, and insists on him accompanying her to buy clothing materials, or nagging about the child's tuition for the next semester, or the rising prices of firewood and rice. You think, how will he feel of disgust and displeasure at this time. I once saw a modern family, both husband and wife were highly educated and could quite understand the art of love. Whenever he finished work, dragging his tired body back to the door of the house, the wife did not say much to him, but gave him a slight smile. This smile was enough to invigorate his spirit and relieve most of his fatigue. Secondly, she then asked her children to bring slippers for their father, and she personally brewed a cup of hot coffee or milk and placed it beside his desk, helping him take off his clothes and hang them on the hanger. At dinner, she prepared his favorite dishes. After dinner, her husband would accompany her to listen to music, or go to the theater, or take a walk in the park; at this time, they could talk and love as much as possible, and if she had any requests, they could be fulfilled. This is really much better than the wife mentioned above.

In fact, true static beauty is distributed in every small action. If a husband can stroke and pay attention to his wife's hair when she is quiet, you will feel that every hair on her head is as precious as silk. If you look at her eyes again, you will find that they contain infinite deep affection. Your heart will be seduced and swayed by these, and when you see her cherry-red mouth again, I think you will not be able to help yourself, embrace her and give her a sweet kiss! In the morning, when your wife is dressing in front of the mirror, you can tie her bow tie for her, or put a fresh flower in her hair. Her heart will thank you for this and give you a smile. If a husband does not pay attention to these details, or forgets to give her a gift on her birthday, then his married life is like having a reef, and he will not receive any warmth from his wife, and there will be no happiness to speak of.

If a wife can pay attention to her husband's daily behavior and actions, or the moment he gets into the car when he goes to work, and his posture when talking, you will be proud of how handsome, generous, and energetic he is. When he accompanies you to a banquet or walks on the street, you will show a knowing smile and a proud expression on your face, because you have found a satisfactory husband.

Dear young men and women, whether you are married or not, whether love has encountered obstacles, I hope you can use your talents to maximize the static beauty of your hearts in order to obtain a happy marriage.

### The Thirty-Sixth Anniversary of the Death of the Famous American Writer Mark Twain

— Yin Huaiyuan

The name Mark Twain, in China and in countries around the world, will not be unfamiliar. Mark Twain occupies the most glorious position in the short history of American literature. He is a novelist, essayist, and also a world-renowned master of humor.

The literary giant's real name was Samuel Langhorne Clemens, and Mark Twain was his pen name. He was born in a small village in Missouri in 1835, but grew up in Hannibal Port on the Mississippi River. He had a natural, keen power of observation, and from a young age he silently memorized every mysterious thing in this frontier area, laying the foundation for several of his immortal masterpieces that he would write later.

The death of his father when he was twelve years old became a turning point in his life. His mother, under duress of poverty, could not continue to send him to school, so she sent him to a printing house to work as an apprentice. Mark Twain was fortunate enough to see newspapers from all over the country in the printing house, so his knowledge increased day by day. Sometimes he even wrote some essays for the Hannibal newspaper. At the age of seventeen, he wrote a humorous sketch and submitted it to a humorous weekly magazine in Boston, describing a young boatman who tried to intimidate a burly and powerful lumberjack, but was beaten and fell into the water. The meaning of the text was extremely humorous, and readers were all laughing.

Before he could create valuable works, Mark Twain constantly studied the various personalities and types of people. He worked in the printing house for nine years, which made him understand a lot of the humor and satirical literature that the public loved, and he also had many opportunities to write articles, but in 1857 he completely changed his profession, and went to a boat to learn how to steer. That year he was twenty-two years old. Seventeen months later, he had learned everything, so he was promoted to pilot.

During that period, the Mississippi River was a major transportation route in the country, and all kinds of people came and went in a constant stream every day. Mark Twain secretly studied their different personalities. His position gave him a lot of free time to talk to passengers. Whether on the boat or on the shore, he always liked to listen to guests tell strange stories from all over. He later used what he saw and heard on the Mississippi River as the subject matter and wrote a famous book "Life on the Mississippi". The book was published in 1882.

After he lived on the boat for four years, the Civil War broke out, and transportation on the Mississippi River was also interrupted. Mark Twain and his brother fled to Nevada. His brother later served as a clerk there, so he lived there for five years. After that, he went to work as a reporter for a newspaper and was sent to Washington to cover the news of the legislative discussions in Congress. The communications he wrote back were first published under the pen name Mark Twain, and from then on he was known to the world by the name Mark Twain, and his real name was not known. At the same time, he also continuously published many short stories in the newspaper, which made his name spread quickly in the Americas, and slowly spread to all over the world.

Mark Twain later left Washington and went to San Francisco, where he found a job as a reporter without much effort. In his work, he fully demonstrated his talent, and from then on his fame grew day by day. During this period, he published a short story "The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County", which was not only reprinted by newspapers all over the Americas, but also quickly reprinted or translated by European countries, and everyone enjoyed reading it. Mark Twain had traveled to Europe, but he did not worship European culture, but praised everything in the Americas everywhere. He once said: "European culture is not worthy of envy, American culture has its own future." It can be seen that he was a writer who loved his country and his homeland.

Mark Twain was a realist, and all his works were nurtured from his life experiences. "Roughing lt" makes people laugh and feel pity for his five years of life in Nevada after reading it. After "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer" and "Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" were published in 1876 and 1884 respectively, Mark Twain's literary achievements reached their peak. The former tells the story of his childhood life in Hannibal, such as the tension of exploring caves and getting lost, or digging for treasures near houses haunted by ghosts. The structure of the story is extremely tight, and the plot attracts readers everywhere. The latter mainly describes life on the Mississippi River. The above two books are Mark Twain's most proud masterpieces in his life, and they have now become immortal masterpieces in the world. His other highly acclaimed novels include "The Prince and the Pauper" (published in 1882). This novel fully expresses Mark Twain's contempt for privilege and his anger at injustice. Mark Twain's last masterpiece in his later years was "A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court", which is a satirical novel, implying that democracy is better than monarchy. It has been adapted into a play and put on the stage, and has won the cheers of millions of viewers.

In the last twenty years, although Mark Twain continued to write, he often went to various places to give academic lectures. In his later years, his name spread all over the world, and he was respected by millions of people. Oxford University also awarded him an honorary Doctor of Letters degree in 1907. When the news of his death in 1910 was announced, the world was shocked. The death of this generation of literary giants was not only a loss for the United States, but also the fall of a superstar in the world literary world.

### Dreamer

— Mo Zong

### Ding Jingshen as Depicted by Luo Liangfeng

— Zhou Shushan

I previously discussed the portrait of Jin Dongxin, a friend of the Qing Dynasty seal engraver Ding Jingshen, which briefly mentioned him. Now, let's first look at what the "Cihai" dictionary says: "Ding Jing, name Ji, of Qiantang, courtesy name Jingshen, sobriquet Dun Ding, also known as Longhong Shanren. Like Jin Nong, he was a scholar of broad learning. He loved bronzes and stone inscriptions, and was particularly skilled in seal engraving, emulating the Qin and Han styles. He was a prominent master, pioneering the Shanghai style and revealing the extraordinary secrets of seal studies for over a thousand years. He authored 'Wulin Jinshi Lu' and 'Longhong Shanguan Shi Chao.'" According to his paintings, he was also known as Yanlin and had a collection of poems called "Yanlin Ji."

Ding Jingshen was originally from a brewing family in Hangzhou, but he was not very wealthy, so he often worked alongside servants at home. However, he loved bronzes, stone inscriptions, and ancient paintings, to the point of obsession. When he found something valuable, he would not hesitate to exchange his clothes for it. He was also skilled in poetry and painting, and became close friends with Jin Dongxin and others in his hometown, discussing art and literature with them. Eventually, they called Ding's residence south of the city "Poetry Country." His personality was particularly unrestrained, and whenever things didn't go his way, he would drink all day long, making it a habit.

Luo Erfeng, name Pin, courtesy name Xunfu, also known as Huazhisi Seng, was from Zhe County during the Qing Dynasty and one of the "Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou." He excelled at painting figures, landscapes, flowers, grasses, plum blossoms, and bamboo. He was a protégé of Jin Dongxin, and his "Stories of Ghosts" was the most famous work of his time. His poetry was also otherworldly, and he remained a commoner throughout his life.

I now see a rubbing of a portrait of Mr. Ding Jingshen, from the hand of this painter, with a seal that reads "Luo Pin of Yangzhou." The eccentricity of his style is evident from just looking at this painting of an old man. At the time, a poem was inscribed alongside the picture, which reads:

"The ancient and extreme portrait of Longhong, abstract and about to take flight like Peng. He looks at inscriptions, stretching with great interest, leaning on his staff from the mossy shore. An unconventional recluse, a great commoner in the world. As if searching for tadpole characters, returning to the temple of Cangjie."

The inscription at the end reads: "Inscribing on the portrait of Layman Longhong, as instructed by Mr. Liangfeng, Yuan Mei." The spirit of this portrait has already been fully conveyed by this poem. There is also a poem by Wu Cangshi, which I will omit here. Also, at the beginning of his poetry collection "Yanlin Ji," there is a portrait of the old man painted by Chen Lin, which is also similar to this portrait.

This portrait later belonged to the "Ding Family's Helu Collection," but it was originally taken to Yangzhou by Luo Liangfeng himself. According to Ding Sou's handwritten poem "Sending the Poet Luo Jun Xunfu Back to Yangzhou":

"Time flies even faster when away from home, how can I bear to see you off without reluctance; the spring breeze has not yet tethered your游舫, and the night rain especially comes to wet the fishing bank. No chance to share the joy of wine, and my dreams are vague; only one thing brings me some comfort, inside the箱裏, my form and bones return with you.(Xunfu painted a large portrait of me leaning on a staff and sitting on a rock to take home.)"

There is also a poem titled "Again Receiving Paintings and Shoes from the Old Man, Replying with a Quatrain": "You gifted me paintings and light shoes, intending to ascend the highest peak above the clouds; new moss grows lushly on the covered shore, allowing only light steps to trace the path."

Regarding this, there is also a painting and poem by Luo Liangfeng to Ding Sou, which I will omit. The friendship between the two can be seen from this; but I wonder if people in today's art world still have such sentiment.

### An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of River, An Inch of Blood 56

— Ye Jingfeng

"What about Engineer Wu?" I didn't want him to ramble on. He was a Shandong native who grew up in Korea. He didn't speak Chinese clearly, nor was his Japanese very good, but he was quite loyal and brave.

"The third time we ran over, we went around in a big circle, climbed over from the backyard of the factory...went around to the east side of the railroad, and ran right into a temporary martial law at the station. The acquaintance on the station told me, 'Commander Song's special train has passed, and there are two cars of guards'...He also told me that the women of Changxindian were robbed, two or three hundred of them, all taken to Gaojiaji, which is two miles northeast of here... I thought Engineer Wu's wife and the group must be among them. What should we do?"

"Yes...what did you do?" I anxiously urged him to continue.

"Reporting to the Secretary-General," he said as if reciting a book. "We had to risk our lives to take a chance and rush to Gaojiaji. There were corpses all along the way, mostly women who had been robbed. We pretended to be Japanese plainclothes, mixed into the group, but no one came to question us. There were many Japanese soldiers there, and the local gentry of Gaojiaji provided them with wine and entertainment. We entered the comfort station, and the situation was even more chaotic. The women were all numbered, and in the three houses and garden, all their clothes were stripped off... The Japanese soldiers drew lots, and whoever drew it would take them to another room. There were many Chinese thugs wandering among the women. The five of us discussed it and also randomly asked, 'Who is Engineer Wu's wife, Xiao Zuan?'...We asked everyone, but no one answered. We didn't recognize them, but they all didn't seem like her...

"If she's not here, maybe she was taken away after being drawn in the lot. If she was taken away, it's useless to save her. We sneaked out again, and no one discovered us. The place was really chaotic. I didn't care who it was, and we rushed back to the station. We ran into Engineer Wu's car on the road, and we waved him down and came here all the way. Just now I saw the old woman under the tree. I thought it was the Engineer's wife. I asked her, and she said that the wives and young ladies had all hanged themselves in the backyard..."

We turned around and looked at the courtyard and went into the back room, but no one was to be seen. There was no one in the kitchen. Suddenly, we heard a comrade shouting at the back door, "They're here." It was the toilet behind the house. We looked out of the house, and it was truly tragic. Three women...Mrs. Wu, Meijun, and Lanjun, were all hanging together, but each of them had several bullet holes in their bodies; probably when they were discovered, they had just died tragically, so they were still covered in blood.

I ordered the men under me to arrange these bodies and went to the front.

"It doesn't look like a fainting spell, but rather a mental illness, very high degree." A young officer explained Dingyuan's situation to me.

"He was sick to begin with," I told him, "neurasthenia, and he's been so stimulated, maybe it's added other symptoms...I think Beiping can still hold out for a while. We'll send him to Beiping, either to find a doctor or to go to the hospital...I don't know if we can get through on the road...?"

"Let's try. I'm afraid there's no better way for the time being. The team leader agreed."

We immediately handed the submachine gun and a bag of bullets to Number 〇 Four and told him to clean up here and come to the ×× Hotel in Beiping to find me. A telegram would also be fine.

Inside the car, Dingyuan started talking incoherently, constantly shouting, "Fen..., where are the children?...Fen...where are the children?" (End of Chapter)

### Bitter Memories—Preface to "Golden Rooster Heart"

— Zhao Qingyan

After proofreading the Shanghai version of "Golden Rooster Heart" (the Chongqing version is titled "Tears of Flowers"), I can't help but think of two good friends who initially encouraged me and helped me with my playwriting—Yu Si and Zuo Ming! Although they aroused my interest in playwriting, I have actually been writing for ten years. Even though it's not good, I have written more than a dozen plays. I ask myself, I have always been worthy of my two good friends. But what about themselves? One followed the War of Resistance, drifting and suffering to the point of no return, poor to the point of no return, not to mention writing plays, they don't even have the mood to write a letter! The other is even more miserable! He was killed by poverty and illness during the War of Resistance, and finally dropped his pen with regret, and went far away! Went to a world that is dark and boundless, went to a illusory realm where I will never see him or find him!

I remember twelve years ago, through Yu Si's introduction, I entered Tianyi Film Company. At that time, my basic job was to edit the self-promotion page of the company's Star Daily. In order to collect promotional materials, I had to visit the shooting site every night. Gradually, I became interested, so I often discussed some film art issues with Yu Si. He kindly instructed me without finding it troublesome, which made me start to have a deeper understanding of film art. Also, because I was learning painting and music at the time, I naturally became connected with film! Soon, Zuo Ming, Hong Shen, Cao Xuesong and other gentlemen joined Tianyi one after another, so I absorbed some knowledge about drama from Zuo Ming. After my novel "Drought" was published, Zuo Ming happily said after reading it: "Your novel is very dramatic, you might as well adapt it into a script!" I was also very happy after hearing this, but I didn't dare to start immediately. I thought I would study it more. Although I had written a one-act play a long time ago. But I always hope that the second time I write it, I can make some progress.

Who knew that after working in Tianyi for less than a year, I was arrested and imprisoned for no reason when I returned to my hometown to visit relatives, on suspicion of political crimes. Bored in prison, I carefully pondered the method of playwriting. At that time, I had a collection of novels translated by Ba Jin on hand, so I chose the article "Revenge" to adapt into a one-act play. After I was released from prison, this script was highly appreciated by Yu Si and Zuo Ming, and was named "Blood Debt". (In the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the consciousness was reprocessed and it became a propaganda script for the War of Resistance. Published by Independent Publishing House in 1938.) Then I collaborated with Zuo Ming on the movie script "Sisters in Distress". (Produced by Jixing Film Company, starring Ms. Hu Shan.) We thought of the story together. When writing, I divided the scenes and he divided the shots. I wrote the lyrics for the interlude, and Mr. Huang Zi composed the music. (Recorded by Baidai Company.) During this period, I also entered the Central Film Studio as a compilation and directing committee member. Just after I finished writing the movie script "Model", the "July 7th" Anti-Japanese War broke out, so Zuo Ming and I led the Anti-Japanese Salvation Fifth Drama Team to the Northwest. However, when we arrived in Kaifeng, we broke up. I independently participated in the war zone drama team of the Sixth Department of the Military Commission as a compiler and director. This was the first time I officially got involved in drama. I worked for a long time until I went to Wuhan to edit the "Tanka" literary monthly, then I left the drama team. After the fall of Wuhan, I went to Chongqing. During this period, Yu Si traveled around and lost his place, and Zuo Ming lived far away in northern Shaanxi. We lost contact with each other for three years. Finally, we reunited in Beibei, Ba County, but Yu had not been in charge for a long time, and Zuo Ming was seriously ill! We originally wanted to cooperate and do some drama again. But Yu Si was not interested, and Zuo Ming had no energy. They were worn out by the War of Resistance, both physically and mentally! Only me, I am still tirelessly writing foolishly, writing some plays that cannot get rid of the literary atmosphere and are considered tepid. "Golden Rooster Heart" is a product of this time. Yu Si helped me plan the division of scenes, and Zuo Ming helped me consider the dialogue. They encouraged me, helped me, and placed their hopes on me alone. Whether in friendship or at work, they treated me like their sister, and sometimes even like taking care of one of their own children! Because of this sincere friendship, I didn't want to let them down, so I continued to write foolishly, until I watched Yu Si become poor and sick and finally died, and Zuo Ming died, so I also ended my playwriting career wearily by writing "Dream of the Red Chamber"! Will I never write plays again in the future? I'm not sure, but anyway, I know that as long as I write plays again, I will think of Yu Si and Zuo Ming, think of these two friends who fell in a society of cold and warmth, and I will be in pain! In pain, what can I write!

Yu Si and Zuo Ming are finished. Who made them finish? The War of Resistance! They sacrificed everything for the War of Resistance, even their lives! But what did they get? And who still remembers them? Not to mention condolences, no one even mentions it. The country ignores them so much, and friends treat them so unkindly. Such a world, such human hearts! It makes those who are alive (Yu Si) shudder, and those who have died (Zuo Ming) will die with their eyes closed!

I would like to dedicate "Golden Rooster Heart" to my two good friends Yu Si and Zuo Ming. Please believe that no matter what world you are in, I, who you once encouraged and helped, will never, ever forget your friendship?

The foreign colleagues who specialize in interviewing news from military and police agencies yesterday sent an open letter to Xuan Tiewu, the garrison commander and police chief. Although this letter is very simple, it contains an indignation for the freedom of the press ignited by a high degree of enthusiasm for work.

During the War of Resistance, our war correspondents went through life and death, galloping on the front lines. Many high-level headquarters had their traces. They were often guests of honor of the generals. Not only did they know the enemy's situation, but they also understood the national army's combat plans. If military secrets are to be mentioned, these are the most confidential.

After the victory, in the capital, reporters often visited Marshall's residence and Stuart's embassy; in Guling, President Jiang and his wife met with journalists almost every day. Speaking of people, these are the most respected people.

We don't need to mention Roosevelt's Atlantic Charter anymore. Even with regard to the public security work in Shanghai, the value and power of journalists' contributions to society is no less than that of military and police agencies. However, one is active and the other is passive, but they all lead to the same goal. Here, let's give a simple example: For example, the garrison headquarters executed several drug traffickers. If the newspapers did not widely publish it, how could the government's intention to prohibit drugs and warn people not to violate the law be achieved?

Foreign colleagues, for the sake of readers, add a page of hard work for every day they work. They suffer and starve, endure hardship and work hard. They are not busybodies, nor are they lunatics, but with the sacred task at hand, they have to do it. Shanghai is closely watched by the world and is the cultural center of the country. It is hoped that all phenomena in this city, which is at the forefront of civilized progress, will show progress, and freedom of the press is the most important of these!

Shanghai Inside Story

### The Thirty-Six Gangs Rampant at the Docks

— Xue Ou

Recently, when foreign ships import goods and unload them on shore, theft and shortages often occur. This is definitely not something that ordinary pickpockets can do, but is done by the organized thirty-six gangs at the docks.

Speaking of the thirty-six gangs at the docks, almost all old Shanghainese have heard of them, which shows their long history. They are a kind of disguised ronin. Their lives and actions are between hooligans and good-for-nothings, but their power has been deeply rooted, so although the police authorities have tried their best to search and arrest them, the effect is actually minimal. Now, these thirty-six gangs at the docks are still rampant everywhere.

The thirty-six gangs have special differences from the real dock scoundrels. Most of the thirty-six gangs are half-way converts, while dock scoundrels must have been born into that life. So now, many of the old brothers of the thirty-six gangs are originally hooligans who have transformed themselves. The reason for this is nothing more than that hooligans cannot find a place to live in their place of origin, and their economic lives have no place to settle down, so they have no choice but to join the thirty-six gangs and become a small soldier to be driven, and gradually promoted to a formal gang member.

The docks occupied by the thirty-six gangs usually have a certain location. They each dominate a dock, which is the same as the heroes and heroines in old novels each dominating a mountain top. They regard the docks as private property and do not allow other gangs to intrude without authorization. For example, if it is the dock of the Qingjiang Gang, the Shandong Gang is not allowed to intervene. Even if something happens to colleagues and they have to go to another gang's territory, they must send someone to talk to the other party in advance, otherwise there may be a large-scale melee. In the past, they often had melees over the docks, injuring people and shedding blood, and they did not regret it.

On the Shanghai steamboat docks, countless merchants and cargo are transported to and from the ships every day, making them very busy. The old brothers of the thirty-six gangs mingle in it, taking the opportunity to show off their skills and make a living. In the past, their attention was focused on individual merchants, hard robbery and soft theft, their skills were amazing, and they often demanded kickbacks from the owners of private boats, who had to give them even if they didn't want to. Now that foreign goods are constantly being imported, their golden age has arrived. As long as they use their skillful hands, no matter how big or small the packages are, as long as they steal them, it is enough for them to eat, drink and enjoy themselves, so the daily life of these members of the thirty-six gangs is very carefree!

The existence of the thirty-six gangs at the docks is a morbid state of Shanghai society and is harmful to merchants and travelers. Therefore, I hope that the police authorities can try their best to search and arrest them, and it is best to establish a dock patrol team to frequently patrol the docks to prevent the thirty-six gangs from showing off their skills and to ensure the safety of merchants and travelers.

### Odds and Ends

— W.W.

Various celebrations for National Day, some celebrate "bumper harvest", some celebrate "cleanliness", the dough is gloomy and thin, the "reason" cannot be explained.

Ding Shu was tired of being unfree in prison, and he can be quiet when he is buried in a silent wild village one day; Zhou Ni Fohai is boundless, he threw himself into the sea of bitterness, so he did not say he was unfree.

Chinese literati have said: "I have a pen like a knife"! The momentum was loud, how long ago was it? The ballpoint pen was invested, "all brothers within the four seas", the brothers are all in danger, even the butcher's knife dare not try it out!

Fashion, makeup, shoes and socks, beauty...most are planned for women, and women are planning for these, using each other, responding to supply and demand, economically speaking, it is indeed a good phenomenon, celebrating the future of Shanghai.

### An Average of Two People Are Run Over by Jeeps Every Day

— Huang Jieqing

According to a Shanghai dispatch published in a Hong Kong Chinese newspaper, in August, the number of jeep-related injuries in this city, in Guangci Hospital alone, has accommodated 35 injured people, including 27 men and 8 women. In addition, there were 20 seriously injured and 5 deaths.

It seems that an average of at least two Shanghai compatriots are sacrificed under the wheels of jeeps every day. However, Shanghai has more than just "Guangci" Hospital, and "jeeps" kill people not only in Shanghai. In addition to this city, Guangzhou, Nanjing, Beiping, Tianjin...have all become their rampant areas, and the number of accidents is no less than that of this city.

Every day two people, should it be multiplied several times? Or dozens of times? Unfortunately, it is not easy to obtain accurate statistics for a while. However, let’s take the lowest calculation of ten times. Jeeps can destroy the happiness of at least seven hundred and thirty families in a year!

### Jeep's Confession

— Suo Bei

I am a Jeep, nicknamed Atomic Tiger, born in the United States during the war, five years old this year. In the past, I traveled on the battlefield, charging and killing enemies, but today I crash around and pass through without obstruction. We don’t know what a note is. Our awe-inspiring power is the note, the hat and clothes of our master are the note, and the signature on the card of our master is the note.

We don't have the habit of giving way. When we move forward at high speed, we are like a rapid wind and lightning. Pedestrians, carriages, and horses, as long as they see our shadow in the distance, will immediately be careful to get out of the way. Otherwise, if something goes wrong and blood is shed, they will know that it is their own fault!

My master has a lot of courage. He took me through red lights, across pedestrian crossings, destroyed big trees, and broke walls. Ending some small lives is commonplace for us. My master has never cared about the dead. He opens the throttle and takes me back to the "department". The sky does not know, people do not know, even if they do, what can be done? As for the attacks in the newspaper and the reality of society, my master said: "Let him attack, I will drive my car fast!" We have always been carefree and caused trouble everywhere. Although the principle is lacking, the momentum is always strong!

I am a Jeep, I am an atomic tiger, pedestrians, horses, hurry up and get out of the way, if you dare to disobey and collide with the tiger, then no matter male, female, old or young, you will be considered suicide. Citizens, please do not take my words lightly!

### Low Profile

— Ge Zhen

Recently, a certain newspaper's advertising column published: A certain mansion plans to recruit a "female wet nurse", which is unavoidable to make people laugh! Is there such a thing as a "sexual wet nurse" in the world?

If there is, it must be alluding to something else. As foolish as I am, I cannot imagine it.

Advertising text inevitably has the disease of "adding flowers to the brocade" and "stacking beds on top of each other". It is commonplace and there is no need to be surprised. The example mentioned above is not enough to be a lesson.

However, reading the news also has similar problems. For example, since autumn in this city, the weather has been abnormally cold and warm, and diphtheria is prevalent. A certain newspaper issued a piece of news, the last sentence of which read: "I hope that diphtheria patients will quickly get vaccinated."

The big traitors in North China have a lot of money, so before the execution, they also published a large advertisement to report the "small traitor" He Chengzhuo, and said that if they did not report it, they would "die with their eyes closed."

When the Suzhou small traitor was escorted to the North Station, he distributed printed materials to the onlookers on the platform. The content was said to be "A letter from 300,000 orphans in the country to the national officials and elders." Without saying the content, just looking at the words "national" already makes people feel strange! Does "300,000 orphans" include "the whole country"? Moreover, "300,000 orphans" may not have written it themselves? Traitor's pen, only sees his heart tired and exhausted every day!

### A Merchant's Home

— Zhang Fu

I have a relative whose family life is very interesting. Their family members are even more interesting. Such an interesting family may be rare in China, and probably rare in the world. Now I will write down their family's interesting life and things.

There are three main figures in this family, namely the father, the mother, and the eldest brother. The father and the eldest brother are typical businessmen. This type can be said to be typically strange. They have to commercialize everything they do, or buy in the same goods; that is to say, no matter what, they have to regard it as a transaction, just like talking about business in the market, they have to wear a hat or earn some commission. Even if it is between father and son, they do not care. Since the two of them moved the business skills in the market into the family, the mother, who is in charge of household management, was quickly influenced and became a typical commercialized housewife. So, the interesting family life between the husband and wife, the father and son, and the mother and son began:

The father works in a bank, and the eldest brother works in the market. When the father calls the son from the bank to buy some stocks, the son unceremoniously puts a hat on the father just like dealing with ordinary customers. Sometimes when the market fluctuates greatly, he may even put a "ruthless" hat on him. But when the son lacks funds and calls the bank to ask his father for help, the father unceremoniously raises the interest rate and earns a ticket from him, just the same. Occasionally when the son is in special need, the father takes the opportunity to be "ruthless" and will not let go unless it is at least three shares of foreign currency.

When the father and the eldest brother are in arrears with the mother's monthly regulations, the mother does not get angry and calculates the interest at a high rate. Moreover, once the agreed deadline arrives, there will be no arrears; but they have never torn up the contract, because they value credibility the most—they maintain credibility like talking about transactions in the market. They would rather argue and quarrel in advance to bargain, but once the "transaction" is agreed, they must fulfill their promises without any objection, although they have close relationships such as husband and wife, parents, and children.

Don't you think this family is too interesting?

### "The Beautiful-Bearded Gentleman" Yu Youren

— Gan Lai

Walking to Sanyuan County, Shaanxi, and paying attention to both sides of the street, the plaques and signs of government offices, schools, shops, and temples will surely surprise you: the inscriptions on them are almost all from the hand of one person, and that person is Mr. Yu Youren, the President of the Control Yuan.

Even if you have never met President Yu, it is not difficult to identify him from any group photograph in which Mr. Yu participates, because President Yu is the "Beautiful-Bearded Gentleman" famous throughout the country, with a large beard under his cheeks, resembling a living immortal.

Started in the Newspaper Business

Mr. Yu is not only a politician and calligrapher, but also a journalist. In the late Qing Dynasty, he presided over the Shenzhou Daily in Shanghai. He once ran the "Min Hu Bao" (People's Cry Newspaper), advocating revolutionary ideas to the people at that time. It was banned. Mr. Yu was not discouraged and continued to run the "Min Yu Bao" (People's Appeal Newspaper), advocating the same views. It was banned again. Mr. Yu then changed to run the "Min Li Bao" (People's Stand Newspaper) and also served as the chief writer. Shao Lizi, a veteran of the Party and State, and the late Ye Chucang both worked for the newspaper.

His calligraphy initially followed the Northern Wei style, then he liked to practice cursive script in middle age, and devoted himself to the study of Zhang Cao script in his later years. His characters are like caged snakes dancing, seemingly quite casual at first glance, but upon closer inspection, each stroke is magical, showing profound skill. Mr. Yu paid the most attention to the structure of characters. He would definitely imitate the strokes of famous calligraphers, both ancient and modern, whom he considered to have reached the level of divine skill. He considered the characters "Sun Wen" personally written by Sun Yat-sen and the character "Xing" written by the martyr Huang Xing to be extremely wonderful and had repeatedly copied them. Most of the scrolls he wrote for others were stamped with two special seals, one being "Crying and Laughing at the Universe, a Cuckoo," and the other being "Half Crying, Half Laughing, Eating the Master." Mr. Yu was capable of poetry and authored "Yu Youren's Poems," but it is rare to see his works in recent years.

President Yu has a fondness for collecting antiques, and a special room is opened in his private residence for storage. During his spare time, the "Beautiful-Bearded Gentleman" often stays in it, stroking them tirelessly, and finds it a source of joy.

Chili Cuttlefish

Mr. Yu loves to eat chili peppers and cannot do without them at every meal. It is said that in his hometown of Sanyuan County, there is a restaurant called "Mingde Pavilion" that has a specialty dish called "Chili Braised Cuttlefish." The cooking method is perfect, and Mr. Yu finds it delicious, praising it endlessly. He specially inscribed "Famous Chef Zhang Rong," which was later made into a plaque and hung on the door as an advertisement to attract customers.

Mr. Yu has served as President of the Control Yuan for more than ten years. Recently, he was appointed to Xinjiang as a senior police officer in the reorganization and inauguration ceremony of the provincial government. At the same time, he is also the leader of the inspection teams in various places, leading his "Tiger-Fighting Generals" to various places to thoroughly investigate the accounts of the receivers, causing those "officials in charge of taking over" to have sleepless nights. We hope that Mr. Yu will show the courage and spirit he had when he founded the "Min Li," "Min Yu," and "Min Hu" newspapers in his youth, and when he entered Shaanxi in the fourth year of the Republic of China to organize the Jingguo Army to fight against Yuan Shikai, to kill several "tigers" with definite evidence of guilt, to eliminate harm for the people, to strive for prestige for the government, and to maintain some dignity for the country!
