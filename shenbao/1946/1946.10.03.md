### Government Issues Solemn Statement, Puts Forward Final Limit of Tolerance, CCP Should Bear Full Responsibility for Disrupting Judgment

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 2nd] At 4:30 PM on the 2nd, the Central Propaganda Department held a temporary press conference for Chinese and foreign reporters, presided over by Minister of Propaganda Peng Xuepei and Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Liu Cuo. Minister Peng first read out the government's important statement on the current situation, the full text of which is as follows:

The government has already agreed to hold a five-person meeting to discuss the reorganization of the National Government Committee, and recently prepared to hold a three-person meeting to discuss ceasefire methods. Unexpectedly, the CCP suddenly issued a statement yesterday, negating the above two meetings, and announced in an autocratic manner that an unconditional ceasefire was necessary, and that it was unwilling to discuss anything else. The government has always advocated using negotiations and political methods to seek a reasonable and legal solution. If the CCP refuses to negotiate and disrupts the two meetings that are about to be held, then the CCP should be fully responsible for all the consequences arising therefrom. An unconditional ceasefire has been implemented twice this year, in January and June, but because there was no effective guarantee, it stopped and started again. As a result, the country has suffered increasingly heavy losses over the past ten months, and the suffering of the people has been unimaginable. There have been ceasefire agreements and military reorganization plans in the past, but the CCP still used the ceasefire period to occupy cities where its military strength was superior, blatantly disregarding them. Where its military strength was inferior, it took the opportunity to enrich and reorganize its military preparations in order to launch another attack on the National Army. Now the Communist Party is issuing mobilization orders on the one hand and raising ceasefire slogans on the other. If there is no real guarantee, the government, responsible for maintaining law and order for the country and protecting the lives and property of the people, cannot allow the people to suffer the pain of civil strife for a long time. Therefore, it is necessary to seek a reasonable and legal solution to the urgent political and military problems in order to seek a practical and effective guarantee and establish lasting peace. The government has sent the following main points to Marshal Ma and Ambassador Stuart in a letter.

The Issue of Government Commissioners and Garrisoned Troops Should Be Resolved Quickly

In order to save time and show its sincerity, the government frankly states the maximum extent to which it can compromise on resolving the current situation as follows:

(1) The CCP has been constantly urging the reorganization of the National Government, and the key to the reorganization is the distribution of seats. The government originally agreed that the CCP would have eight seats on the National Government Committee, the China Democratic League four, for a total of twelve seats. The CCP demanded ten seats for the CCP and four for the China Democratic League, for a total of fourteen seats. Now the government compromises by conceding eight seats to the CCP, four to the China Democratic League, and one seat among the non-party members to be recommended by the CCP. The government agrees, for a total of thirteen seats. The CCP should immediately submit the list of CCP members of the National Government Committee and the list of its representatives to the National Assembly, but this agreement should be agreed upon by the informal five-person group meeting and then submitted to the comprehensive group for agreement. (2) In order to effectively implement the military reorganization plan, the garrison locations of the CCP's eighteen divisions should be quickly stipulated, and they should enter the garrison locations within the prescribed time limit in accordance with the regulations. This resolution should be formally agreed upon by the three-person meeting and then submitted to the Military Mediation Executive Department for supervision and implementation.

If the CCP is truly sincere in seeking peace and cooperation and is willing to quickly resolve these two issues, then both parties should immediately announce the cessation of military action when an agreement is reached. The press conference adjourned at 6:00 PM. In the evening, reporters asked the CCP delegation about its reaction to the government's statement. According to spokesman Mei Yi, the government's memorandum was sent to Shanghai by a special person tonight. The CCP's attitude will depend on whether Representative Zhou Enlai reads it and asks for instructions from Yan'an. In addition, after the government issued this statement, the Nanjing Central Daily News immediately issued an extra edition at 6:30 PM in the afternoon. The people of the capital have gained a new understanding of the current situation and deeply understand the government's painstaking efforts to seek peace through tolerance. The change in the current situation has now stopped in anticipation. Mr. and Mrs. Men arrived in Beijing one day, and Foreign Minister Wang received them at the Foreign Ministry's official residence on the afternoon of the 2nd.

### Wang Yitang's Case Concluded, Sentence to Be Pronounced on the Morning of the 8th

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 2nd] The Capital High Court opened a court session at 10:00 AM on the 2nd to publicly try Wang Yintai. The court debate concluded at 1:00 PM in the afternoon, and the sentence was scheduled to be pronounced at 10:00 AM on the 8th. Wang was returned to custody.

[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 2nd] After the arch-traitor Wang Yitang was sentenced to death by the Hebei High Court, his daughter and defense lawyer argued that Wang Yitang could not speak due to illness and that the court had proceeded directly to judgment, requesting a retrial. During this period, Wang Yitang actually published a notice in the Beiping newspaper on the 2nd, asking his lawyers Fa Zanxi and Gao Chengen to say, "The judge presiding over my case is He Chengzhuo, President of the Hejiang High Court and concurrently Chief Judge of the Criminal Court of the Hebei High Court, with the style name Kongchao. It is found that the presiding judge served as the Director of Academic Affairs of the Pseudo-Judicial Officer Training Institute affiliated to the Pseudo-North China Political Affairs Commission during the pseudo-organization period. Gui Buji (reporter's note: Gui was the Director of the North China Branch of the Pseudo-Judicial Administration Department and has been sentenced to life imprisonment) can be interrogated and the staff roster of the Pseudo-Judicial Officer Training Institute can be consulted." He continued: "If it is said that Yitang is a major traitor, the presiding judge is a minor traitor under the control of Yitang. After the restoration of the country, the work of judging traitors is actually entrusted to traitors. What will the world think of this generation? Although Yitang has political mistakes, he has read the books of sages and adheres to the teachings of shame. He is deeply afraid of leaving a great shame on the history of judging traitors in the Chinese nation. Therefore, he has not said a word in the past trials, and he has unspeakable pain. If he is sentenced to capital punishment by this traitor judge, Yitang will not rest in peace. In addition to presenting to Chairman Chiang of the National Government, President Song of the Executive Yuan, President Ju of the Judicial Yuan, President Yu of the Supervisory Yuan, and Inspector Li of Hebei, stating that the court organization is illegal, maintaining judicial dignity, and protecting national integrity, he has specially hired lawyers to publish the notice." It is reported that when Chairman Chiang first came to Ping, he secretly informed He of being a traitor, but after Deng Zhexi, President of the Hebei High Court, proved that He was acting under Deng's orders and engaged in underground work in the judicial circles of Ping, he was given a non-prosecution disposition.

### Preparations for National Assembly Completed, Youth Party Denies Submitting List

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 2nd] Preparations for the National Assembly are about to be completed. Hong Lanyou said on the morning of the 2nd that although the convocation order has not been issued today, given the current traffic situation, it is not too late to issue the convocation order on the day the registration begins. The Preparatory Committee will close on the day of the opening ceremony, and the Secretary-General will take over the relevant matters. When the convocation order is issued, a news group will be established, or the Central Propaganda Department will be requested to send personnel to assist. However, the number of seats for the audience is limited, and it is feared that too many reporters cannot be accommodated. It is also said that although the preparations are all in place, the authorities always hope to convene the meeting in a harmonious atmosphere.

[Central News Agency, This City News] A spokesman for the Propaganda Department of the Chinese Youth Party said: "The Shanghai Ta Kung Pao Nanjing special dispatch on October 1 stated that, regarding the National Assembly representatives, 'Since the government issued the notice asking the various parties to submit the list of representatives, only the Youth Party has submitted the entire list so far.' It has been found that our party has not submitted the list of National Assembly representatives. The news is completely inconsistent with the facts."

### Statistics on Communist Army's Violations of Agreement After Signing of Ceasefire Agreement

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] Relevant parties recently compiled statistics on the important facts of the Communist Army's violations of the agreement and attacks on the National Army since the signing of the ceasefire agreement on January 13, and explained their process and impact as follows: (1) Northeast Region (January 13 to the end of May), after the government and the CCP issued a ceasefire order on March 10, the Communist side violated the agreement and suddenly occupied Yingkou on January 14, and subsequently occupied Fushun, Benxi, Siping Street, Weichun, Harbin, and other places, and gathered 170,000 troops in Siping Street to attack our northbound National Army that was receiving sovereignty. The war in the Northeast broke out as a result, and it affected the interior (according to Lin Biao, the commander of the Communist Army in the Northeast Region, used about 200,000 troops). (2) Shandong Region (beginning in early June), after the chairman issued the second ceasefire order on June 6, the Communist side actually took the opportunity to launch a large-scale offensive in Shandong, occupying Zaozhuang on the 9th, and Dezhou and Taian on the 10th, disregarding the restrictions of the Military Mediation Department, and occupying Gaomi, Jiaoxian, Nanquan, Lancun, and many other cities and towns. At the same time, a large army of 50,000 men was gathered on the outskirts of Qingdao, and more than 100,000 men were gathered on the outskirts of Jinan, fiercely besieging the suburbs of the two cities, especially the most dangerous situation of approaching the water source of Qingdao, Nanquan and Huangbu. The coal and grain areas of Jinan were also fiercely besieged. In order to protect Qingdao and Jinan, the government had the Jiaoji Road War (according to Chen Yi, the commander of the Communist Army in the Shandong Region, used about 150,000 troops). (3) JinSui Region (beginning in early June), after the Communist Army occupied Houma and Jining, it echoed Shandong in early June and launched a large-scale offensive against Shanxi, successively occupying Wenxi, Shuoxian, Xinjiang, Yuci, Jiexiu, Jiangxian, Shanyin, Ningwu, Fanshi, Daixian, Jiaocheng, Lishi, Huairen, Hongdong, Zhaocheng, Qin County, Ying County, Hunyuan, Wuhe, Huoxian, Lingshi, Fenxi, and other 22 counties, and actively destroying the Zhengtai and Tongpu Roads, gradually completing the encirclement of Datong and Taiyuan, thus causing the Jinan War (according to He Long, Liu Bocheng, Han Jun, and Nie Rongzhen, the commanders of the Communist Army in the JinSui Border Region, used about 90,000 troops). (4) Northern Jiangsu Region (beginning on July 13), after the government issued a declaration on June 30, emphasizing its willingness to resolve the situation politically, the Communist Army actually gathered 16 regiments, about 40,000 men, and suddenly attacked Taixing on July 13. In this battle, our defending army, the 83rd Division, was forced to fight in a hurry, resulting in heavy casualties. After the Communist Army captured the city on the 15th, it continued to attack Taixian and the important town of Kouan on the north bank of the Yangtze River, attempting to threaten Nanjing and Shanghai. The National Army was forced to resist, and the Northern Jiangsu War broke out (according to Chen Yi, the commander of the Communist Army in the Northern Jiangsu Region, used about 40,000 troops). (5) Datong Region (beginning on August 3), since mid-June, the Communist Army has successively occupied Shanyin, Hunyuan, Daixian, Shuoxian, Huairen, Fanshi, Ying County, Ningwu, Yunxian, and other nine counties on the outskirts of Datong, and launched a real battle to besiege Datong on August 3, using more than 30 regiments, about 50,000 men, and attacking a total of 35 times, causing heavy casualties to soldiers and civilians on the outskirts of Datong, and disregarding the government's repeated warnings. Therefore, there was a war to relieve the siege of Datong (according to He Long, the commander of the Communist Army in the Datong Region, used about 50,000 troops). It is also known that the Communist Army has violated the ceasefire order and attacked the National Army 4,852 times since September 13. Since the surrender of Japan, the Communist Army has captured 344 county seats inside and outside the customs.

### Current Financial and Monetary Situation: The Government Resolves to Improve It. Premier Song Explains Financial and Economic Policies to the Shanghai Petition Delegation, Striving to Contract Currency and Stabilize Prices.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] The Shanghai Municipal Assembly's Commerce and Industry Petition Delegation, after petitioning the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry on the morning of the 2nd, proceeded to the Executive Yuan to meet with Yu Hung-chun and Wang Yun-wu, the two ministers, continuing the discussions from yesterday. The two ministers expressed their appreciation for the points raised by the delegation and promised to convey them to Premier Song. The talks began at 11:00 AM and concluded at 1:00 PM, lasting a total of two hours. At 4:00 PM, the representatives met with Premier Song, and departed at 5:00 PM. Some of the representatives braved the rain for a tour of Xuanwu Lake, and in the evening, attended a banquet hosted by the Bank of Communications, with Speaker Pan Gongzhan also in attendance. The petition delegation, after two days of hard work, met with Chairman Chiang, Premier Song, and the heads of relevant agencies to advocate for Shanghai's industry and commerce, concluding their mission to Nanjing. They will return to Shanghai successively on the 2nd and 3rd to report the progress of their trip to the more than four million citizens of Shanghai.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] When Premier Song met with representatives of the Shanghai Municipal Assembly's Petition Delegation at the Executive Yuan at 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd, he gave a brief explanation of the government's current financial and economic policies, and with a very sincere attitude, stated that the government is currently making its utmost efforts to improve the current financial and monetary situation, so that the currency will no longer inflate and prices will no longer rise. Mr. Song expressed interest in the delegation's proposal to organize an economic rehabilitation committee in Shanghai. He also promised to humbly adopt other suggestions and agreed to instruct relevant ministries and commissions to discuss practical solutions. He would do his best to implement those that could be done, and he was unwilling to make unrealistic promises for those that could not. Mr. Song wore a light green Hong Kong shirt today, and was in good spirits, speaking with the representatives in fluent Shanghainese, appearing very cordial, as many of the representatives had known Mr. Song for one or two decades. Minister Yu of the Ministry of Finance and Minister Wang of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, who were also present, had close ties with Shanghai in the past. Therefore, the conversation proceeded in a very harmonious atmosphere throughout.

### If There Is No Solution to the Financial Problem, the Economy Will Be Difficult to Improve. The Government Has No Intention of Competing with the People for Profit.

Mr. Song first explained that finance and the economy are closely related, and if there is no solution to the financial problem, the economy will be difficult to improve, and vice versa. Some people blame the government for focusing solely on finance and neglecting the economy, but this is not entirely true. He then explained the current economic situation, pointing out that if the situation were clarified, the economy would have already improved. However, the situation is not so ideal. The situation in South China is relatively better, while North China is affected by traffic obstruction and transportation cannot be smooth, which affects production. For example, before the war, North China produced abundant cotton, and our country's cotton production was almost self-sufficient. Now, we have to rely heavily on foreigners. Coal also has to be transported from Qinhuangdao, and a portion has to be purchased from foreign countries. Under such circumstances, expenditures naturally increase, and income decreases accordingly. The gap between income and expenditure is widening. There are two ways to make up for the difference: namely, issuing more currency and finding ways to increase income. The former is likely to cause currency inflation, affect price increases, and raise wages and interest rates, which is not a good policy. Therefore, we must start by increasing income. The authorities are doing their best to do anything that can increase financial income. For example, enemy and puppet materials must be sold at the best possible price, so as not to allow a few people to benefit from the sale at a low price. In addition, the establishment of companies such as the China Textile Corporation is aimed at bringing legal tender back into circulation, contracting currency, and balancing or approximating income and expenditure, and making every effort to prevent currency inflation and price increases. At this point, Mr. Song said in a firm and confident tone: What I am doing is for all of you (referring to the representatives), for Shanghai, and for the general public, not entirely for the government. The government has learned of your suggestions regarding industrial, commercial, and agricultural loan programs, and will humbly accept them, and will instruct the relevant ministries and commissions to conduct practical research. Those that can be done will be done, and those that cannot be done will not be promised in vain. He expressed interest in the delegation's proposal to establish an Economic Rehabilitation Committee, because economic construction cannot only be about preserving residual work, but also about seeking expansion and increase. In the future, Japan's reparations to the Allied countries can be expected to be a large part of our country's share. These reparations of materials and factories should not only be sold, but an institution can be organized to jointly deal with them. The name does not have to be the Rehabilitation Committee. This institution will formulate an entire plan, such as artificial silk machines can be claimed from Japan, but factory sites and working capital must be carefully studied and planned. Other industries can also use this method to jointly carry out operations. Finally, Mr. Song explained that the government has no intention of competing with the people for profit. He said: The government's handling of the China Textile Corporation is to increase government revenue. If all Japanese textile factories were sold at that time, there would not be such a large revenue to make up for the national treasury. The government's policy is that, for large-scale enterprises, unless state-owned is impossible, it is very willing to study with all parties to organize a committee to jointly promote them. Our vision should not only focus on the present, but also plan for the future. The amount of Japanese reparations is very large. The problem lies in how much can be utilized. I deeply hope to work with you to discuss how to make good use of them.

### If the Situation Is Not Clarified, It Is Inevitable That One Thing Is Neglected for Another. The Government's Difficulties Are the People's Difficulties.

After Premier Song finished speaking, the representatives spoke separately. Xi Yushu spoke first, raising the following points: (1) He hoped that the government's financial policy could be flexible and that banking specialization could be realized as soon as possible, and that the restrictions on commercial banks could be relaxed, allowing property to be used as reserve funds, and that the deadline for paying reserve funds could be changed from monthly to quarterly. He hoped that the procedures for industrial, commercial, and agricultural loans could be simplified and that they could be recycled so that the people could benefit from them. (2) Shanghai factories deeply feel the pain of insufficient electricity supply. He hoped that plans could be made as soon as possible to get through the difficult seasons, and that when lending to factories, real estate and machinery could also be used as collateral, because using raw materials and finished products as collateral would affect costs. (3) He hoped that tax rules could be simplified and that tax sources could be cultivated. (4) In terms of international trade, we should be vigilant against Japan's return, and he hoped that large amounts of loans could be made for export materials that could bring in foreign exchange. In terms of imports, we should find ways to prevent certain materials from entering the country and prevent smuggling, and we should facilitate the import of machinery, and the settlement of foreign exchange should not be limited to those who can import within three months. (5) The market from time to time issues unfounded rumors about foreign exchange, which greatly affects prices. He hoped that those who stir up trouble with US dollars could be set a trap so that the evildoers would suffer themselves. (6) State-owned enterprises should be treated the same as private enterprises so that they can develop equally. After he finished speaking, Mr. Song responded, explaining that the government has found a way to use US ships to generate electricity to solve the electricity problem in Shanghai. He also said: Many phenomena are contradictory. For example, this year there has been a bumper harvest everywhere, and there are large amounts of disaster relief materials to help us carry out post-disaster work, and the surplus materials are also very beneficial to our construction. It is a pity that the situation has not been clarified, so the government has to adopt transitional measures, resulting in the phenomenon of neglecting one thing for another. Then, Jin Runxiang spoke, explaining that the government's difficulties are the people's difficulties, and the people's suffering is the government's suffering. Having this opportunity to explain to each other can increase mutual understanding. He expressed his gratitude to Premier Song for humbly adopting public opinion. He hoped that the Rehabilitation Committee could be established as soon as possible to achieve unity between officials and the people. The government currently has difficulties, but it cannot therefore neglect economic construction. He hoped that both aspects can be taken into account to overcome the difficulties together. Luo Qinghua spoke, hoping that talents can be widely recruited and the Rehabilitation Committee can be established as soon as possible to relieve the suffering of industry and commerce, and that loans will not fall into the hands of speculators, and that the scale should be slightly relaxed to comfort the people's hopes. Finally, Wang Yansong spoke, hoping that the boundaries between state-owned and private enterprises can be eliminated, and suggested that the financial and economic ministries should hire people with history and qualifications in the financial and industrial sectors to establish an advisory committee that meets regularly to listen to the opinions of private enterprises. Mr. Song agreed to discuss this suggestion with the two ministers. The meeting had lasted for about an hour at this point. Just then, Ambassador Stuart came to visit the premier, and the representatives then took their leave.

### Sino-American Agricultural Team in Hangzhou to Discuss Improving Agricultural Products

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 2nd] After the Sino-American Agricultural Technical Cooperation Team arrived in Hangzhou, this morning they went to the Provincial Agricultural Improvement Institute and nearby silk farms to inspect, and in the afternoon, they held a discussion meeting in the Provincial Government Auditorium with 11 units, including the Construction Department, Agricultural Improvement Institute, Water Conservancy Bureau, Dike Engineering Bureau, Sericulture Institute, Social Affairs Department, Land Administration Bureau, and Agricultural Bank. They were divided into two groups for discussion, the first group was for agricultural technology, and the second group was for agricultural economy, including methods for improving important agricultural products such as tung oil, tea, hemp, and silk.

### Chiefs of All Departments and Offices of the Executive Headquarters Expressed Weariness.

[Report from Our Newspaper] After Chiang Ting-fu resigned, yesterday the chiefs of all departments and offices of the Executive Headquarters expressed weariness. Liu Hongsheng also had the intention of being the executive director. However, it is generally believed that those who are bound to leave include Deputy Directors Li Zhuomin and Pu Xuefeng, General Affairs Director Hu Rishi, Investigation Director Xiang Jingyun, Distribution Director Wang Fusheng, Finance Director Dong Chengdao, and Zheng Baonan, Chen Zhimai, and Shen Weitai of the Office in the United States.

Furthermore, it is definitely known that the British government had learned of Mr. Chiang's resignation beforehand, and had criticized that the transportation situation of the Executive Headquarters had not only not improved, but had also deteriorated. If improvements are not made, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration will consider suspending all relief supplies to China.

Another report: Yesterday, Director Chiang went to the office as usual and worked, with a calm attitude, seemingly waiting for the handover. It is said that the internal personnel of the Executive Headquarters will undergo major changes in this reorganization, but the position of Executive Director Liu Hongsheng will not change.

### A US Tank Overturns on the Pingjin Highway.

Two Marines Killed and Two Wounded.

[United Press, Peiping, 2nd] The US Marine Corps Command announced that a Sherman tank escorting a convoy traveling from Peiping along the Pingjin Highway towards Tianjin suddenly overturned on the side of the road eleven miles from Peiping, resulting in the deaths of two US Marines and the serious injury of two others. After the accident, Marine Corps doctors and ambulances rushed to the rescue. The announcement stressed that the accident was "not due to any hostile action." It is believed that the accident occurred due to continuous rain and soft road surfaces.

### Chiang Reviews Work and Declares Economic Hardship.

All Work Half Successful and Half Failed.

At the Executive Headquarters work review conference held in Nanjing this month, Mr. Chiang made a detailed self-review of the work of the Executive Headquarters. Since the start of the work of the Executive Headquarters, half of it has been successful and half of it has failed. The main reason why it has not been satisfactory and has aroused criticism from all sides is the economic hardship.

### The Changchun Railway Is Full of Scars. The Railway Tracks and Bridges Were Severely Damaged by the Communists. Currently, Less Than 600 Kilometers Are Open to Traffic.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 2nd] The Sino-Soviet joint venture Changchun Railway, stipulated in the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, has been struggling in pain for half a year due to reception and military relations, and it has been very difficult to survive. Wang Zhuting, Deputy Director of the Railway, spoke about the current situation of the railway, saying: Before March this year, the Changchun Railway was under Soviet military management. The National Army advanced into Shenyang, and the Communist Army retreated northwards step by step. In April, I flew from Harbin to Shenyang. The Harbin Railway General Bureau was managed by the Soviet Director. After the Shenyang Railway Branch Bureau was established in April, the National Army began rushing to repair and transport. The Changchun Railway merged the Middle East and South Manchurian Railways, with a total length of over 1,818 kilometers. Currently, the section that has been taken over and opened to traffic extends from Yingkou in the south to the First Songhua River in the north, with a length of over 597 kilometers. The area under the jurisdiction of the branch bureau currently has 16,600 employees, including 240 Soviet citizens, and 77 Soviet citizens in places such as the Fushun Coal Mine. There are also about 800 Japanese technical employees. Military transport and repatriation of Japanese prisoners of war are very fast. Due to the shortage of vehicles for passenger and freight transport, the maximum daily transport capacity is only 100 vehicles, most of which are grain and salt, and a small number of fruits. The daily income is only 5 to 6 million circulation coupons. Due to the large difference between income and expenditure, the government subsidizes about 150 million yuan per month. However, because the Communist Army severely damaged the railway bridges, the funds for the emergency repair project are very large. In the future, freight transport must be used to make up for the shortfall and reduce government losses. In addition, the Soviet Union has recently not expressed any opinion on the Changchun Railway. The situation of the General Bureau and the northern section of the railway is currently unknown.

### Postal Service Begins Handling Small Remittances in Northeast China.

Limited to 2,000 Circulation Coupons.

[Our Changchun Dispatch, 1st] The Northeast Postal Service began handling small remittances today, but the area is currently temporarily limited to Liaoning, Jilin, Jinzhou, and Harbin, which are within the reach of the government's decrees. Remittances are limited to 2,000 circulation coupons. Within the remittance area, a fee of 2 yuan is charged within the 2,000 yuan limit, and supplementary water is added separately. The methods for areas without banks are: (A) Calculate 1 cent per yuan remitted (the minimum fee of 2 yuan is charged for those within 200 yuan), (B) Add a special fee of 4 cents per yuan, and (C) Add supplementary water separately.

### Vice Admiral Sir Denis Boyd Arrives in Qingdao, Gui Yongqing Accompanies Him.

[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 2nd] The British Pacific Fleet flagship and destroyer visiting China arrived in Qingdao this afternoon. Vice Admiral Boyd and his party, and Gui Yongqing, flew here from Nanjing one hour earlier. Boyd hosted a banquet for Mayor Li Xianliang, US Rear Admiral Cooke, the British Consul-General in Qingdao, and others this afternoon. He will attend a banquet hosted by Cooke in the evening. Tomorrow, Chinese leaders will host Boyd and his party. Boyd will meet with the British community in Qingdao and visit the Central Naval Training Corps. He is scheduled to leave Qingdao for Qinhuangdao on the 4th. In addition, Gui's visit is to inspect the Central Naval Training Corps and the naval fleet stationed in North China.

### Hangzhou Dance Halls Operate Secretly. The Police Chief Orders Severe Punishment.

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 2nd] Dancing in Hangzhou has been banned for a long time. Due to the sluggish market and poor business in recent days, there have been proposals to resume it. Mayor Zhou also intends to fulfill this intention. Therefore, although it has not been approved, it has been operating in stages. However, the police bureau's prohibition is quite strict. For example, restaurants such as China and Jin Guo have been detected one after another. Police Chief Shen has ordered severe punishment.

### Suiyuan Suffers Repeated Floods. Disaster Victims Cry Out for Help.

[Our Guihua Dispatch, 1st] The counties in western Suiyuan suffered widespread flooding this summer. Unexpectedly, the autumn floods are even more serious. Many channels have breached their banks. The water outside the city of Linhe is four feet deep, and boats can travel on land. Most of the villages have been submerged. The two protective dams outside the city have been washed away. People in the city have moved out one after another. From September 19, after three days and nights of rushing to block the breaches, the city walls were fortunately safe. However, people outside the city trapped in the water are crying out for help, and the situation is extremely miserable.

### Methods for Repatriating Returned Overseas Chinese Are Determined.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] Regarding the repatriation of returned Overseas Chinese to their original place of residence, after many days of preparation by the Executive Headquarters, Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, and Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the methods have been largely determined. In addition to the approximately 4,000 Overseas Chinese in Burma who have been sent to Burmese territory via land through Wanting, large-scale maritime repatriation from various places is about to begin. It is learned that the Executive Headquarters has decided to first repatriate Overseas Chinese concentrated at the ports of Guangdong and Fujian and Overseas Chinese mechanics who returned to the country to serve during the War of Resistance.

### Does Not Know How to Do Business! Before and After Chiang Ting-fu's Resignation. An Ethical Person Stepped Down. He May Return to the Classroom.

[Special Feature from Our Newspaper] The resignation of Chiang Ting-fu, Director of the Executive Headquarters, has finally been approved by the Executive Yuan. This news is indeed a bit surprising—why did the Executive Yuan not approve his resignation until now?

Mr. Chiang has resigned more than once, and the Executive Yuan's handling of him is really quite interesting. For example, the Executive Yuan ordered him to compile the Executive Headquarters budget, and the result was a considerable figure of 432 billion yuan. The Executive Yuan actually reversed its usual practice and approved it immediately without deduction. Mr. Chiang was of course very happy. It was not until he was preparing to receive the funds from the Executive Yuan that the Executive Yuan said that the 432 billion yuan "post-disaster relief fund" had already been allocated to the relevant agencies such as the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the Ministry of Transportation, and the Water Conservancy Commission for post-disaster relief work. If the Executive Headquarters wants money, you have to go to them!

The budget was prepared by the Executive Headquarters, but the result was that not a penny was received. In other words, the government did not give money. Mr. Chiang had to rely on borrowing from banks and selling supplies to maintain expenses, but when President Bei of the Central Bank took office, he said bluntly: "We run a bank, not a charity. If you want to borrow money, first show us the collateral." Of course, if you really want to talk about collateral, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration would immediately fly into a rage, especially since the Director of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, La Guardia, is known for his fearless temper!

Speaking of selling supplies, this matter has long been the target of public criticism, and the Executive Headquarters has been scolded as the "Relief Headquarters itself" for this. Moreover, at one point, the relief supplies only consisted of food, but food was later explicitly prohibited from being sold by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. Therefore, the Executive Headquarters was completely unable to move. Mr. Chiang had to submit four proposals to the Executive Yuan: First, please allocate funds; second, please allow the Executive Headquarters to borrow from banks; third, allow the Executive Headquarters to contact the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to ship a little less supplies to save expenses; fourth, allow him to resign.

Premier Song was very unhappy when he heard this, and said: "You only know how to ask me for money. If you don't have money, you shout about resigning! If you can resign, can't I resign?"

Therefore, Premier Song's solution was neither to give money nor to allow him to resign—however, the Central Bank finally agreed to the Executive Headquarters' request and borrowed 80 billion yuan, but with one condition: the Executive Headquarters must repay the Central Bank 10 billion yuan every month.

The immediate crisis was resolved, but what followed were countless fragmented small stimuli, but unfortunately we cannot publish them here for the time being.

Mr. Chiang is from Hunan and has a very straightforward temper. Moreover, he is a scholar and an ethical person. Therefore, he has a hard-working spirit—but he has really been able to suppress this bad mood!

Last month, the Executive Headquarters convened its branch offices in Nanjing and held a work review meeting. At this meeting, Mr. Chiang delivered a sharp speech, reversing the usual practice in officialdom and speaking extremely bluntly. Nanjing and Shanghai immediately spread the news that Mr. Chiang was going to resign, and everyone believed that Mr. Chiang was writing a conclusion to his work, and he was bound to leave. Unexpectedly, the Executive Headquarters suddenly issued a denial message, but the "denial" was very reluctant. At that time, when our newspaper recorded this news, it added the sentence "All parties are still closely watching." The result is: it really came!

Everyone remembers that Hu Shih, Ding Wenjiang, Weng Wenhao, Chiang Ting-fu, He Lian, and others all laid down their teaching posts and stepped onto the political stage at the same time. Now, Mr. Chiang seems to be the only one left. Although the position of the Executive Headquarters is difficult to hold, the situation cannot be said to be small. Mr. Fu Mengzhen put it best: "Everyone has their strengths and weaknesses. Although Mr. Chiang has not been able to meet the requirements of all parties in the past year, and he has had disagreements with his direct superiors, what can he do? I personally heard Premier Song say: "Chiang Ting-fu does not know how to do business." I suddenly realized that this is the standard!"

Mr. Chiang may return to the classroom. Three universities in the United States have already invited him to teach. Mr. Chiang's resignation is meaningful: it seems to symbolize the end of "scholars in politics." We do not seem to be able to imagine asking scholars to specialize in "business," do we?

Mr. Chiang's successor, Huo Baoshu, has served in the banking sector for a very long time. Presumably, he is sure to be proficient in "business." We firmly believe that the Executive Headquarters will be able to have a new look from now on. When the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Far East Conference is held in November, we would very much like to hear what the most picky US representative, Gip Quirk, and the Soviet representative, Seminas, have to say?

### Zhang Junmai, Representative of the Democratic Party, Expresses Opinions on the Current Situation: Two Matters Should Be Resolved Before the National Assembly Convenes

[Our Newspaper's Report] Zhang Junmai, leader of the Democratic Socialist Party, recently expressed the party's views on the current situation, stating: "On the 28th of last month, newspapers published a statement by Chief Secretary Wu to Agence France-Presse, which included the following passage: 'The government still hopes that the Chinese Communist Party and the Democratic League will participate in the National Assembly. Invitations have already been issued, and both the CCP and the Democratic League are among those invited. There is no reason for them to refuse to participate. Implementing the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and convening the National Assembly is the government's policy.' A reporter asked: 'If the CCP ultimately refuses to participate and causes the conference to collapse, what will the government do?' Mr. Wu replied: 'In any case, the National Assembly will be convened according to the scheduled date, which is November 12th of this year. There will be no changes. Currently, we still hope that the CCP can participate in the conference.'"

After reading this passage, we feel that it gives the impression that the government has decided to convene the National Assembly according to the scheduled date, and that the CCP and the Democratic League intend to refuse to participate after receiving the invitations. This statement is likely to cause misunderstanding among the people of the country and the world. The Democratic Socialist Party is a cooperative group with the Democratic League, and since the government's statement involves the Democratic League, the Democratic Socialist Party should clarify its position.

Since the Political Consultative Conference began in January, all parties have had an understanding of political issues, namely, to resolve everything through consultation and not resort to force. However, after the conclusion of the conference, the list of National Government members and National Assembly representatives was affected by the issue of the Nine Eastern Provinces, which impacted the reorganization of the government and the convening of the National Assembly. As a result, the list of National Government members and National Assembly representatives was not submitted. In late April, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek gathered representatives from five parties to discuss the issue of convening the National Assembly. Everyone believed that the National Assembly was related to national unity. If the National Assembly was convened solely by the Kuomintang, other parties would not agree to participate, and the only opportunity for the country to achieve unity would be lost, irreparably. In other words, China's political wounds could only be healed by this "rubber band". At the time, I personally was present and strongly advocated for postponement. This idea was adopted by Chairman Chiang, and Mr. Wang Yunwu, the current Minister of Economic Affairs, stood up to speak after the decision to postpone, requesting that a date be decided. Chairman Chiang replied that if a date was set, the meeting must be convened on schedule. Having a date and not convening the meeting is worse than not setting a date. Therefore, it was decided to postpone it. According to the spirit of the Political Consultative Conference, the postponement was decided through consultation, and the date of the meeting should be decided through consultation. However, in early July, the government unilaterally decided that the National Assembly must be convened on November 12th. In early July, it seemed that the convening date was still more than four months away, so everyone was not too worried. With a period of four months, there must be a turning point in national affairs. Therefore, they did not oppose or support the government's unilateral decision to convene, only hoping that all parties could participate together, which would naturally be the most satisfactory outcome.

However, the Marshall mediation plan failed to be signed on June 30th. Since then, the domestic situation has deteriorated day by day, and has now evolved into a full-scale war. It goes without saying that this approach is completely different from the situation when the Political Consultative Conference was held in January. Amid the roar of artillery fire, compatriots are killing each other, and the sacrifice of financial and human resources is immeasurable. The government intends to resolve the issues of northern Jiangsu, Chengde, and others through force. This situation is similar to the Wars of the Roses in British history and the American Civil War. Under these circumstances, it is impossible for any party or faction to participate in the National Government or the National Assembly. Therefore, in our opinion, the two things that should be resolved before the National Assembly is convened are: (1) a ceasefire; (2) consultations on the National Government, the National Assembly, and the draft constitution.

(A) Ceasefire

Whether the country can be unified in the future depends on whether the military reorganization plan can be implemented. The military reorganization plan is like the overall control of a chessboard. This plan was signed long ago during the Chongqing period, and was re-submitted in the Marshall mediation plan on June 30th. The Communist Party has also acknowledged that the ratio of five to one remains unchanged and has said that the two armies will concentrate in defensive areas and be reorganized within six months. According to this plan, the so-called overall control is still in the hands of the government and not the Communist Party. Although it cannot be said that the military has been nationalized, the first step has been taken. In our view, the foundation for domestic peace has been established by this plan. In addition to the military reorganization plan, there is the issue of gains and losses in specific areas, such as northern Jiangsu, Chengde, and even the garrisoning of troops in the Nine Eastern Provinces. We believe that this is the main cause of this war. We would like to propose the following points as solutions: (1) The Communist Party in northern Jiangsu had already acknowledged on June 30th that they would only keep one army. The dispute is whether the garrison should be stationed in Huaian or north of the Longhai Railway. We hope that the CCP will agree to withdraw its troops north of the Longhai Railway. (2) At that time, the Communist Party proposed two points: First, to retain the security force. Second, to keep the local administration unchanged. We hope that the CCP will abandon these two points, and that the government will appoint someone trusted by both sides, such as Leng Yuqiu, as the administrative head of northern Jiangsu, to soothe the people after the war, to prevent people from taking revenge on each other, and to properly resolve the land issue according to the principle of "land to the tiller." (3) Regarding Chengde, the reason why both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party must compete for Chengde is that, from the central government's perspective, the area is sufficient to threaten the railways of Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanhaiguan. From the Communist Party's perspective, it is a key station for transportation between Zhangjiakou and the Northeast. In our view, according to the talks in May and June, the central government occupies Chengde, and the area north of the city can be given to the CCP, which would be a satisfactory solution for both sides. (4) Zhangjiakou. When discussing the military reorganization issue in May and June, Chairman Chiang originally intended to have the CCP withdraw from Zhangjiakou, but Chairman Chiang agreed due to Marshall's strong advocacy, so Zhangjiakou remained with the CCP in the June compromise plan. The government's attack on Zhangjiakou this time originated from the CCP's initial attack on Datong. Now that Datong has been relieved, the government should immediately cease its attack on Zhangjiakou to fulfill Chairman Chiang's promise to Marshall and to express that it will not have further demands due to temporary military victories. (5) The issue of the Nine Eastern Provinces was already decided during the negotiations in June. The area north of Qiqihar and Yanji should be assigned to the CCP. The CCP should hand over Harbin and restore transportation on the Chinese Eastern Railway so that the central government can fulfill its obligations under the treaty with the Soviet Union.

The domestic war issue should be concluded as stated above. (Continued on page 3)

Editorial

### The Path to International Coordination

Since Marshal Stalin made a statement to a reporter from the London Times, revealing the Soviet Union's conciliatory tone, some people have hoped that the three major leaders could have a meeting to resolve some of the major disputes currently, or that the Soviet Union could make factual demonstrations to alleviate the current situation with practical actions. But seeing the recent new developments in Europe, for example, the Soviet Union has once again notified the Turkish government, insisting that the Dardanelles Strait be jointly defended by the Soviet Union and Turkey, abolishing the Montreux Convention, and requiring that the Dardanelles Strait be jointly controlled by a convention established by the Black Sea countries; Moscow radio broadcasted announcements accusing Britain and the United States of violating the Potsdam Agreement and demanding that the Ruhr industrial zone be placed under international co-management instead of the current British military occupation. Things like these seem to indicate that the Soviet Union's consistent policy remains firm, so the so-called relaxation is still a question.

The issue of the Dardanelles Strait is not a revision of the Montreux Convention. With the changes in the environment, the amendment of the existing situation in the strait was originally agreed upon in Potsdam. The Soviet Union's position seems not to be based on the Montreux Convention, but to re-establish a new strait system centered on the Black Sea countries, with the joint defense of the southern strait by the Soviet Union and Turkey as a prerequisite. This amendment, which did not start from the Montreux Convention, has not been approved by Britain and the United States. Therefore, when the Soviet Union previously requested to amend the situation in the strait, although Turkey was able to agree to the Soviet Union's request, Britain and the United States did not approve it. This matter has been shelved until now, and the Soviet Union still reiterates the previous request and submits a new note to Turkey. It can be seen that the Soviet Union's position on foreign policy will never be easily abandoned. Speaking of international cooperation in this situation is probably just one-sided hope.

As for the internationalization of the Ruhr, the Soviet Union believes that the Ruhr industrial zone, which is currently the British occupation zone, has failed to effectively implement the Potsdam Agreement, so the Soviet Union advocates placing the industrial zone under international control. The Soviet Union believes that all military organizations have been dissolved in the Soviet occupation zone, all Nazis and fascists have been expelled from administrative agencies, and no factories can be used for military purposes. However, the Ruhr industrial zone, which is the base of German militarism, has failed to adopt these measures, and therefore requires international co-management. If we recite the Soviet Union's accusations and U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes's speech in Stuttgart at the same time, we can know how Britain and the United States are concerned about the unification of the postwar German national life, and at the same time, someone is trying to build a high wall or iron curtain on the divided German territory, destroying the unification of German national life. All of these are differences in the views of the two sides. What international cooperation needs is that each other can have a recognized understanding of the other's views, and then find agreement from different perspectives and seek coordination. This requires concessions from both or multiple parties; if each party insists on its own opinion and wants to force others to agree, it seems to be losing the original intention of international cooperation.

Since Marshal Stalin has had the previous remarks, hoping to strengthen cooperation with Western countries, if everyone has reduced intentions, it will not be difficult to find a path to coordination. President Truman reiterated his belief in peace when he visited the West Point Military Academy football game the other day, which shows that the heads of the United States and the Soviet Union have the same feelings about basic beliefs. At the same time, Ickes and Morgenthau, former members of the Roosevelt cabinet in the United States, made speeches at the Thirty-First State Liberal Party Conference, requesting President Truman to hold talks with Attlee and Stalin "to end the surprising war negotiations as soon as possible," which shows that American public opinion also advocates that the three major leaders can have a meeting to resolve the major disputes at present. What we want to state here is that we advocate closer cooperation and coordination internationally, but we must adhere to some basic principles. The Atlantic Charter, the Four Freedoms, and even the United Nations Charter are all basic principles. We are willing to sacrifice tens of millions of lives, and the purpose is to ensure these principles, such as respecting the territorial integrity and sovereignty of all independent countries, respecting the right of the people of all countries to determine their political system, etc., so we must not easily abandon these principles. "Yalta" has made a big mistake, leaving a stain on human history. While demanding international coordination, we cannot allow the repetition of "Yalta."

### The Sentencing of Nazi War Criminals

The Nuremberg International Tribunal sentenced the main Nazi war criminals on the 1st. Those sentenced to death included former Air Force Marshal Göring, former Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, and former Army Commander-in-Chief Keitel, among eleven people. Those sentenced to life imprisonment included former Navy Commander-in-Chief Raeder, Hess, and Funk, among three people. Those sentenced to 20 years in prison included Schirach and Speer. Those sentenced to 15 years in prison included former Foreign Minister Neurath. Those sentenced to 10 years in prison included former Navy Commander-in-Chief Dönitz. Those acquitted included former Ambassador to Turkey Papen, financier Schacht, and former Stormtroop Leader Frick. Regarding the acquittal of the latter three, the Soviet judge of the Nuremberg International Tribunal raised objections, believing that they should be convicted and not acquitted. Regarding Hess, the Soviet judge also believed that the original verdict was inappropriate and should be sentenced to death, but this opinion was not adopted by the International Tribunal; it was only an attachment to the verdict document, used only to express the Soviet Union's position.

The trial of war criminals in Nuremberg this time is a meaningful event in history. The term "war criminal" arose after this World War; although there were plans to try "war criminals" after World War I, it never became a reality due to the changing circumstances. It is a new concept to try the main ruling figures of a defeated country as the victor and accuse them of crimes. In the past, some public law scholars, especially German public law scholars, believed that war was a continuation of national policy and was not a crime in itself. Only when international regulations related to combat were violated, such as disrespecting the Red Cross flag and mistreating prisoners, did it constitute a crime. Because there is this concept that war itself is not a crime, some countries do not hesitate to use war as a means of aggression. In establishing an international legal order, we should first eradicate this erroneous concept, confirm that launching a war is itself a crime, and that the ruling figures who participate in this decision are "war criminals." National policies are determined by the ruling figures, so these ruling figures cannot escape their responsibilities. It is in this sense that we see the Nuremberg war crimes trials. There is no doubt that this trial of war criminals is an important milestone in human history. This is an example of establishing an international legal order.

The Nazi war criminals were accused of four crimes: (1) conspiracy to rebel, (2) undermining peace, (3) launching war, and (4) violating humanity. The establishment of this charge lies in pointing out that launching a war and thus undermining peace and violating humanity is itself a crime, and that those who participate in this decision should bear legal responsibility. For the sake of future world peace, we support the establishment of this principle to maintain the international legal order. The Nazi war criminals sentenced in Nuremberg were all the masterminds of this war, and they are now being punished as they deserve. Due to their execution, we can be sure that the Japanese war criminals currently on trial in Tokyo will soon follow in the footsteps of these Nazi war criminals and be punished as they deserve. This is indeed an event in international justice worthy of great fanfare. We deeply hope that due to the establishment of this new international legal concept, humanity can no longer use war to resolve disputes, and that humanity can live together peacefully under the order of international law, which would be the greatest harvest of this trial of war criminals.

### The Seawall Engineering Bureau Explores the Root Causes, Plans to Fundamentally Cure the Qiantang River Flood, and the Seawall Repair Project Will Begin in November

[Our Newspaper's Report from Hangzhou on the 1st] Dr. Tang Zhenxu, Deputy Chief Engineer and Acting Director of the Design Department of the Qiantang River Seawall Engineering Bureau, has been actively promoting the design work of the bureau since taking office. In addition to rushing to design the repair project to be started in November, he has also spared no effort in exploring the fundamental treatment plan of the Qiantang River in order to achieve a permanent solution. The Design Department has organized a Qiantang River tidal measurement team and established eleven hydrological stations in Fuyang Wenjia Weir Gate, Qibao, Ganpu, Haining Babao, Xiaojianshan, Ganpu, Haiyan, and Zhapu to measure the tidal water level, river flow, sediment content, and cross-section of the Qiantang River. It is also cooperating with the Nanjing Central Hydraulic Laboratory to set up a Qiantang River model test in Hangzhou and analyze the soil properties of the Qiantang River at the Shanghai Rongpu Bureau. It is also cooperating with the Central Geological Survey and Zhejiang University to survey the landform and geological data of the Qiantang River as the basis for the fundamental treatment plan.

### Haining Suffers Heavy Disaster and Requests Tax Exemption

[Our Newspaper's Report from Haining] Since the outbreak of the war of resistance, the people of this county have been ravaged by the enemy. After the victory, they hoped for a good harvest to slightly relieve their suffering. Unexpectedly, heaven defied people's wishes. The spring flower income was only enough to cover wages, and the silkworms suffered a terrible loss. After autumn, first there was a severe drought, and the cotton and soybeans were scorched. The late rice produced white ears. After White Dew, it was hit by continuous autumn rain. The water level rose, and the rice stalks were broken and submerged in the water, all sprouting. The farmers worked hard all year round, but it all became nothing. The disaster is unprecedented in past years. With the disappointment of the autumn harvest, the farmers' livelihood has fallen into despair, and they have rushed to the township and town offices to report the disaster. Recently, the township and town offices of Cunshu, Chunfu, Dingqiao, Guodian, Yuanhua, and Boru have reported to the county government by telegram, requesting pity for the people's suffering and quickly sending personnel to inspect the townships, allowing the reduction or exemption of land taxes to relieve the people's hardship.

### Northern Jiangsu Recovers Salt Area and Comforts Salt Workers

[Our Newspaper's Report from Xinpu on the 1st] Since the Haizhou salt-producing area was occupied by the Communist army for three-quarters, the salt tax revenue has suffered a great loss. Now, when the Communist army in northern Jiangsu is shaken, the Haizhou salt affairs authorities sent teams in two directions to advance into the Guanyun salt area on the 29th. The Communist army was unable to resist and retreated in disarray, carrying weapons and surrendering to our army. The Eastward Advancing Army recovered Zhuang such as Liuxin Zhangxu Bridge, and the Southward Advancing Army recovered Zhuang such as Zhang Yi Nong Su Zhuang. The salt field public office has sent personnel to the recovered salt area to comfort the salt workers and supervise the sweeping of the autumn salt to enrich the national tax revenue.

This matter is being urged by the county associations to be completed as soon as possible. (4) Improving the dormitories of various reception centers and adding doors, windows, and straw mats.

### Large Sailboats Carry Lake Bandits to Surrender; Liao Bingnan's Troops Registered and Organized

[Report from our Suzhou Office] Since the gathering of Liao Bingnan's troops from the Taihu Lake platform at Three Mountains, the local pacification authorities here (i.e., the Taihu Lake Bandit Suppression Headquarters) dispatched staff officer Jin Jiarang, bringing uniforms and food, to Three Mountains. He led more than 150 surrendering personnel from Liao's troops, divided into ten large sailboats, which set sail at 2:00 PM on September 30th and arrived at Xukou at 11:00 PM that night. Staff officer Jiang Renjie and director Wan Zheng designated the troops to temporarily reside at the Xu Wang Temple and the Xukou Town Office. Registration and organization were scheduled to begin on October 1st.

[Report from our Wujiang Office] In various districts bordering this county, the reeds and rushes are not peaceful. The Taihu Lake bandit troubles have barely subsided, and bandits have risen along the eastern roads. Military police and local defense forces are exhausted from suppressing and chasing them. Recently, Li Defu, a former surplus officer from the Loyal Salvation Army, who had been stationed in the Luxu Beiku area for a long time and was very familiar with the local geography and personnel, gathered a gang of seventy or eighty people and turned to banditry. They occupied the Sanbaitang and Fenhu areas, robbing and looting, causing unrest in the villages every night. The county government decided to suppress them severely and, in addition to issuing orders to the local defense forces in each district to conduct joint patrols and encirclements, recently ordered Luo Yunlong, the captain of the Security Brigade, to lead a team to patrol the Chenhu area near Luxu on the border of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. They encountered the bandits, and five bandit boats opened fire to resist arrest. In a fierce battle lasting over an hour amidst gale-force winds and torrential rain, the bandits were eventually defeated and fled, leaving behind one bandit boat and capturing two bandits. One, Shen Shunfu, was the former town mayor of Beiku Town, and the other, Mei Zhenhua, the township head of Kuxi Township, was suspected of harboring bandits. Both were sent to the county government for legal action. He Nianchun, the district chief of Tongli, personally led a large team to patrol in order to defend the local area and prevent the bandits from fleeing into the district.

[Report from our Jiading Office] Wu Zhuyun, the main culprit in the 2.4 million yuan robbery of a car in this county's Lutang Town, was originally an unemployed vagrant. During the War of Resistance, he falsely claimed to be a guerrilla and committed atrocities. After the restoration of peace, he continued his evil ways and engaged in robberies everywhere. A month ago, he robbed money and bicycles on the Jia-Lou Road. After the incident, four accomplices, including Wu Xingjin, were captured. The bandit also privately engraved a seal of a certain troop, attempting to commit unlawful acts. On the evening of the 28th, he gathered Wu Daomin and five others in the Lu family residence in Zhao Lane Township, Luodian, again plotting unlawful acts. They were detected and captured, and a pistol and some bullets were found on the spot. They have been sent to the county for legal action.

[Report from our Jiaxing Office] Business shops and residences in various towns and villages under the county's jurisdiction and in the suburbs have repeatedly reported robberies. Although the authorities have stepped up strict arrests, few have been solved. On the night of the 28th, dozens of bandits armed with long and short weapons suddenly appeared in the ferry crossing of Daqiao Town. More than ten families, including the Cheng family in the village, were looted, losing a considerable amount of food, clothing, and legal tender. After more than two hours, they fled towards Xiangxi Township in Tangbei.

### Xu Xiang Sentenced to Ten Years in Prison for Forming a Gang and Extorting Money

[Report from our Wuxi Office] Xu Xiang, an officer of the city defense command in this county, shielded opium and formed a gang to extort money.

At 4:30 PM on the 30th, the military judge Pu Shizhen, Yin He, and staff officer Han Shujie of the headquarters formed a military tribunal and, after the interrogation, sentenced the main culprit Xu Xiang, a major in active service, to ten years of imprisonment in accordance with the regulations for punishing corruption. Six accomplices, including Cui Xiaoheshang, were transferred to the court for interrogation.

Black Market Tickets Sold in Front of the Railway Bureau

Yesterday, I returned to Changzhou from Shanghai. When I arrived at the North Railway Station to buy a ticket, they were sold out. At this time, a police officer was standing in front of the second-class ticket booth, peddling black market tickets. As a poor civil servant, I saw that the price of an ordinary ticket was more than double the original price. I questioned the police department of the Railway Bureau. I request that the police officer be severely punished to prevent this bad practice. This concerns the reputation of the police department and should not be ignored as a trivial matter. [Ben Fen]

Hygiene in Alleys Should Be Improved Quickly

Mr. Editor: Hygiene Bureau Director Zhang Wei said in response to a senator's question that some waste transport boats dump waste into the Huangpu River halfway, and that he is "planning to disguise himself to investigate." This shows Director Zhang's seriousness. However, I wonder if he is aware that we, who live in alleys without sanitation facilities, see sanitation workers pour most of the waste from chamber pots into the sewers every day. This hinders public hygiene. It would be best if the director could find a way to correct this, which would greatly benefit the citizens. (Li Shanyang)

Land Tax Deeds Should Not Be Like Excessive Levies

I am originally from Chuansha but live in Shanghai. Recently, I learned from my fellow villagers who came to Shanghai that the county government in my hometown has also begun to handle land property rights or transfer registration. I personally went to my hometown a few days ago to handle the transfer registration at the township office in my jurisdiction, paying 6% land deed tax, calculated at an estimated value of 350,000 per mu, plus a surcharge of slightly more than 2%, and an additional supervision fee of slightly more than 2%. The registration procedure must be handled indirectly by the township office, so a handling fee of as much as 5% must be paid when entrusting the office to handle it. In total, the fee to be paid is 15% of the estimated value, which is several times the announced payable value. Furthermore, various fees are arbitrarily created, which seems like excessive levies. The township office is actually a Bao-Tian institution, which takes advantage of the indirect registration to arbitrarily charge a handling fee of 5% of the value, which is suspected of raising fees under false pretenses, which is deeply regrettable for the people. I recently heard that a people's protection conference was convened in my hometown, which I am very pleased about. I take this opportunity to propose, for the convenience of fellow villagers in Shanghai, that they be allowed to directly apply to the county government for registration, in order to avoid blackmail and relieve the people's difficulties.

May We Think of Farmers When We Eat

The need for loans is realistic, but there are no good results. Look at grain loans, which ended up leading to rising prices. Although a few petty officials and unscrupulous merchants were dealt with, how could they compensate for the losses of consumers across the country! As for agricultural loans, aren't they creating opportunities for evil forces to hoard or exploit high-interest rates? All poor farmers still sell their crops early or borrow at 30% interest. It was recently reported that agricultural loans will be held again. Instead of being nominal and ineffective, it would be better to purchase rice and grains and, when food is scarce, distribute them to poor farmers at the original price plus official interest. Wouldn't that be more practical! If a Constant Granary is established, it can also stabilize prices, which is even more practical, rather than loud thunder but no rain.

Farmers are both producers and consumers. How can the fledgling cooperative business resist the extravagant, money-worshipping merchants who repeatedly exploit them? Even if a portion of supplies is distributed by the government (sugar), no matter how much they rack their brains, the black market remains. They do not think of using the Baojia system for distribution. Therefore, high prices are the farmer's fatal wound. When farmers are under the high pressure of life, they need blood transfusions. Otherwise, if government orders are distorted, popular resentment will boil over, creating a good opportunity for rebellious elements, which will deeply conceal the hidden dangers in the safe and secure areas. Every word of "seven points politics" shows that improving the lives of farmers is the main topic of administration. I hope that those in power will think of farmers when they "eat"! (Pan Baoyi)

### Zhang Junmai's Opinions on the Current Situation (Continued from Page 2)

(B) Political Issues: The civil war problem should be resolved in the manner described above. Regarding the statement by Administrative Director Wu that "various parties and factions intend to refuse to participate in the National Assembly," it must also be explained that other parties and factions cannot participate in the National Assembly under the current state of war because such a National Assembly would certainly be unilateral. The Central Government has its National Assembly, and Yan'an has its People's Congress. If other parties participate, it is equivalent to participating in the civil war. The incessant civil wars of the past thirty or forty years have caused everyone heartache. We always hoped that after the end of the War of Resistance against Japan, the entire country would unite as one and engage in reconstruction. Therefore, in late April, I advocated postponing the National Assembly because I wanted to preserve this mechanism to achieve national unity. If the Central Government and the CCP each convene their own National Assembly, and other parties participate in either, it is equivalent to helping A fight B, or helping B fight A. We do not want this phenomenon to continue to occur in the future, so we strongly advocate a unified constitution and a unified National Assembly to create national unity. If the Central Government usually calls for unity, why should it insist on unilaterally convening the National Assembly this time? I think this approach is contrary to its usual advocacy of unity. Chairman Chiang usually considers himself responsible for resisting Japan and building the country. To create a divided country after eight years of the War of Resistance is certainly not what Chairman Chiang wants. Therefore, we advocate a ceasefire first. After the ceasefire, all parties and factions can naturally unite and cooperate in national reconstruction. If the ceasefire problem mentioned above can be resolved, the harmonious atmosphere in the Political Consultative Conference since January will not be difficult to restore.

The so-called political issues are no more than three: 1. the National Government, 2. the National Assembly, and 3. the draft constitution. 1. Let us first talk about the draft constitution. In March and April, the five parties showed no significant differences on the draft constitution in the constitutional drafting committee, so a consensus was reached. Although some parts were not completed, 80% was established. On the last day, the CCP once stood up to explain, "This is a record and not a draft," but we know that the reason they said this was because there was a decision to convene the National Assembly in mid-May, and the CCP had not yet decided to participate. If there is a National Assembly that the CCP does not participate in, and this draft constitution is taken out and said to be approved by the CCP, the CCP is afraid of such a situation, so it specifically stated that this is a record and not a draft. As for the points that everyone had already agreed on at the time, I think the CCP still recognizes them now and will not deny them. If a week or two more effort is put into the draft constitution, it can certainly be completed and, according to the agreement at the time, used as the only draft constitution. Each party would restrain its members and be responsible for passing it. I think there is no difficulty in completing the draft constitution.

2. Regarding the National Assembly issue, friends heard from the Central Government that it seems that the Central Government always suspects that the CCP does not intend to participate in the National Assembly. In our contact since the Political Consultative Conference, we do not feel that the CCP does not want a unified National Assembly or constitution. As long as the Central Government agrees to a ceasefire, the CCP will not find it difficult to express its participation in the National Assembly. As for the number of National Assembly delegates, it can be discussed according to the proportion of three-quarters and a little more than one-quarter, and there will certainly be no major difficulties.

3. The reorganization of the National Government involves several issues: (1) The so-called fourteen seats issue. Originally, the so-called government should be organized by people with the same opinions and policies. The government should be a unit with consistent internal opinions. The Political Consultative Conference decided that the Democratic League and the CCP should occupy fourteen seats, as if assuming that the Kuomintang is on one side and the Democratic League and the CCP are on the other side. This creates a situation of two opposing sides. The reason for this veto power at the time was that people outside the party were afraid of three things: 1. civil war, 2. damaging the people's fundamental rights, and 3. continuing to maintain one-party dictatorship in finance, military affairs, and culture. If the Central Government can change its usual practice and devote itself to peaceful construction, and exercise the laws and administration of the country with a fair spirit, not to mention that the Democratic League can be consistent with the Kuomintang, even the CCP can be consistent with the Kuomintang. Therefore, the fourteen seats issue should not be taken as a difficult problem in the government. Just ask whether its policies are democratic. If the government can avoid one-party dictatorship, all parties and factions will certainly not make things difficult for the government or oppose the Kuomintang in the government. (2) In addition to the fourteen seats in the National Government, there is also the issue of the reorganization of the Executive Yuan. The Executive Yuan is the executive organ, and the National Government Committee is the decision-making organ, so the real power of administration is in the Executive Yuan, not in the National Government. If the current Executive Yuan is not reorganized and is to be reorganized after the constitution is promulgated, I am afraid that the reorganization of the Executive Yuan will be more than a year away. Because from now on, it will take at least three or four months to convene the National Assembly to discuss the constitution, and elections will be held within six months after the constitution is promulgated, so it can be seen that the implementation of the constitution will be at least one month later. If the list of National Government Committee members in the coalition government is decided before the National Assembly is convened, and the Executive Yuan, which bears the actual responsibility for administration, is to be reorganized ten months later, I am afraid that it will be too contrary to the intention of refreshing the world's eyes and ears, which will certainly not satisfy the people of the whole country. Therefore, in our view, the reorganization of the National Government and the Executive Yuan are not two problems but one problem.

From the above discussion of the ceasefire and political issues, if the government immediately ceases fire, negotiations on political issues can certainly be completed in a harmonious atmosphere. Therefore, we are willing to assist the government from the perspective of unity. If it does not take this path and still convenes the National Assembly unilaterally, then there will certainly be three results: (1) The unilateral National Assembly will make it impossible for all parties to participate, (2) Yan'an will certainly convene a People's Congress in the liberated areas, promoting a split in China, and (3) After our internal division, the Soviet Union will take North China as a base, and the United States will take South China as a base. Because of our division, the confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union in the Far East will be promoted even more. A few days ago, a foreigner came to talk and made a profound impression on me. He said, "A divided China is the beginning of the Third World War." I have such a future picture in my mind, so I often have a sense of trepidation, so I strongly hope that the government will cease fire first, and then discuss political issues to achieve China's unity, and create a unified China from a unified National Assembly and a unified constitution. This is the only hope of our Democratic Socialist Party.

### Hull Calls on Great Powers to Cooperate and Ensure World Peace; Septuagenarian Still Concerned About the Current Situation While Bedridden

[US News Service, Washington, dated 1st] Former Secretary of State Hull, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, suddenly suffered a stroke on the eve of his 75th birthday and was rushed to the Washington Naval Hospital for treatment. According to people in the hospital, his condition is quite serious.

[Associated Press, Washington, dated 1st] Former US Secretary of State Hull, who is seriously ill, issued a statement from his sickbed today, calling on the great powers to cooperate in this most dangerous moment in history. Hull said that although there are various dangerous disputes among the countries that won World War II, their existence is the right path to peace and security, and there is absolutely no reason to hesitate or doubt this. I believe that all countries must base their relations on a major fact, that is, the main interest of each country is also tied to ensuring security in a peaceful world, and to promoting the economy and prosperity of their people in this world. The great powers must restore the unity they lacked during the war. Since the darkest period of the war, the need for cooperation between the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, China, and France has never been greater than it is today. These countries still have a special responsibility to jointly exercise their global leadership, both within and outside the United Nations and other international institutions, to promote the unity and cooperation of all countries.

Diplomatic Masterpiece Postponed Due to Illness

### Death Sentence for German War Criminals to be Executed on the 16th of This Month; Göring and Jodl Request Commutation to Firing Squad

[Report from This Newspaper] Paris, 2nd (Emergency Broadcast from Nuremberg): The main German war criminals sentenced to death by the Nuremberg International Tribunal will be executed by hanging in Nuremberg.

Göring and Jodl, through their lawyers, have indirectly requested the Four-Power Control Council to be spared the dishonorable hanging and to be granted execution by a military firing squad instead. Although Keitel has expressed indifference as to how he dies, his lawyer has also made the same request on his behalf. The executions will be held inside Nuremberg Prison.

[Agence France-Presse, Nuremberg, 2nd] The eleven Nazi war criminals sentenced to death by the International Tribunal are scheduled to be executed on the 16th of this month. The execution will not be public; only eight Allied journalists will be allowed to attend. The journalists have decided to issue a unified report, to be translated into three or four languages and published in various countries. It is also learned that former Ambassador to Turkey, Papen, and former Nazi radio propagandist, Fritzsche, were acquitted yesterday by the International Military Tribunal. However, as their accommodations have not yet been arranged, they spent last night in prison as "guests of the Americans." According to Schacht's German defense lawyer, Dix, speaking to a reporter from this agency, Schacht has not faced any risks thus far. However, risks may arise today, as some Germans may attack Schacht.

[Report from This Newspaper] London, 2nd (Broadcast): Well-informed sources in Nuremberg say that after the Nuremberg International Tribunal trials conclude, Nazis who committed war atrocities will also be tried in November. Preparations for the trial of German industrialists are underway but not yet complete.

Austria and Czechoslovakia Request Extradition of German Criminals

[Reuters, Vienna, 1st] The Austrian Foreign Minister announced tonight that Austria will request the extradition of Seyss-Inquart and Papen to Austria for questioning regarding their Nazi crimes during the annexation of Austria.

[Associated Press, Prague, 1st] Czechoslovakia will request the Four-Power Control Council for Germany to extradite former Foreign Minister Neurath to Prague for a new trial on new charges. Neurath served as Governor of Bohemia and Moravia after the German occupation of Czechoslovakia, during which the German Gestapo brutally murdered many Czech patriots.

The Rumor of Papen Becoming President of Germany

[Agence France-Presse, Hanfort City, Germany, 2nd] A rumor is circulating here among Germans and British, stating that a new government will soon be formed in the British and American occupation zones of Germany, headed by the three former government officials acquitted yesterday by the Nuremberg Tribunal. According to the rumor, Papen will be President, Schacht will be Finance Minister, and Fritzsche will be Minister of Propaganda. It is said that the peace issue in Europe might be resolved due to the release of these three individuals.

[Report from This Newspaper] Paris, 2nd (Broadcast from Nuremberg): Even Schacht's defense lawyer, Dr. Jelis, expressed extreme surprise at Schacht's acquittal, stating that it was completely unexpected. He also said that while the verdict was generally fair, it was unfair to some defendants. For example, Keitel's crimes were no more serious than Dönitz's, yet Dönitz was sentenced to ten years in prison, while Keitel was sentenced to hanging.

Schacht Misses His Wife and Children

[Agence France-Presse, Nuremberg, 1st] Former Minister of Economics and President of the Reichsbank, Schacht, was very pleased after his release. He told a reporter from this agency that the prosecutor himself understood that serious crimes should not be attributed to him. He stated that during the war, he often fought against the war, so he was confident that the court would eventually release him. He hopes to see his wife and two sons soon. When the reporter asked him about his thoughts on the court's verdict, Schacht replied that some verdicts were quite fair, but others were excessively harsh. When asked about his future plans, Schacht replied that he hoped to return home immediately and never see reporters again. When several people asked Schacht for his autograph, he smiled and said, "My two sons haven't eaten chocolate for two years. If you can give my sons candy, then I will sign for you."

Where Will Papen Go?

[Report from This Newspaper] Paris, 2nd (Broadcast from Nuremberg): Papen's son, Franz Papen, has requested the authorities in the French occupation zone to issue a pass and necessary documents so that his father can enter the French occupation zone. However, it is unlikely that permission will be granted for him to enter the French occupation zone. Papen's only way out is to go to his daughter in the British occupation zone. His daughter, who is 23 years old, resides in Hamburg.

### France in Revival (Part Two)

Song Yu, Reporting from Paris:

It's over. According to a veteran French student, during the German occupation, all industries in France were in decline. The word "National" (originally meaning domestic or domestically produced) in the French language had almost become a synonym for shoddy goods, similar to the meaning of the word "Russian" after the Russian Revolution in Chinese. For example, ordering a "National" coffee or going to a "National" restaurant meant getting the cheapest stuff. But in the year since the collapse of Germany, the use of this word has gradually decreased and been forgotten, which also shows that France is gradually

regaining its confidence. The French are naturally optimistic and never forget to have fun anytime, anywhere. In this war, France suffered far more injuries and pain than Britain, but today, people traveling in France can no longer see the scars of the war. When someone mentions it, it seems like a distant memory rather than a painful and visceral reality. This is completely different from the situation in Britain. In London, you can't help but be reminded by people or things that the war has just ended and everything is being revived and rebuilt. Once, a reporter took a train from Paris to the countryside for fun, sitting in third class, which was quite crowded. Most passengers couldn't find seats and had to stand in the car, but the people standing didn't seem to mind the crowding and took the opportunity to tease and joke with each other. Later, when the train arrived at Xiang Jiyang, two more young couples got on, also squeezing into the crowd. Soon, they took out harmonicas and started playing, and gradually some people started singing along. Eventually, almost the entire car responded, and as the singing subsided, the teasing followed. The entire car immediately turned into a mass song and entertainment party. This kind of

extravagant enjoyment is rarely seen in Britain. The British always keep a straight face, looking gloomy and quietly focusing on hard work. If you talk to them, they will tell you how great Britain's losses were during the war and how arduous and urgent the recovery work is. Sometimes, it makes people impatient and can't help but ask them how much responsibility Britain shouldered in the entire war. Once, a reporter went to the Luxembourg Palace to attend the European Peace Conference and found two journalists in the palace's attached bar, drinking while recording the speeches from the radio. When they had a moment, they would take a few sips of wine. This kind of working without forgetting to have fun can probably only be seen in France. Speaking of drinking, reminds the reporter of another thing. Wine and perfume are both special products of France. Champagne, brandy, and wine are all most famous when produced in France. But the amount of wine consumed in France itself is also considerable. Ordinary restaurants always have wine with every meal. Whether you drink it or not, the wine bill is included in the meal bill, as if you have already drunk it. Coffee, on the other hand, is charged separately. In slightly more luxurious restaurants or dance halls, opening multiple bottles of champagne is used as a sign of wealth. For those of us who are not used to drinking, having to pay for wine with every meal is a bit wasteful. Once, I casually mentioned to a Frenchman that having wine with every meal in restaurants seems wasteful for people who don't drink. He said, "What's wasteful?

Everyone in France drinks wine." What he said was probably true. People who don't drink wine are doomed to lose money when they go to France. The French love beauty, so art and literature are particularly developed. Even now, when the economy is difficult, they still spare no expense to decorate and beautify. For example, there are many stone statues and churches in Paris, and every night when the lights come on, they illuminate these artistic masterpieces from various angles, so that their beauty is fully revealed, and passersby have the opportunity to fully appreciate them. Therefore, the lights are often on all night long. Paris has many such artistic achievements, and the cost of electricity must be greatly increased, but the French do not see this as a hardship, but as an honor. In contrast, Britain prioritizes economy everywhere. Even today, only one-third of London's streetlights are allowed to be turned on, and decorative lights are not allowed to be turned on at all. In June, for the Victory Day celebration, the arc lights around the statues around Buckingham Palace were turned on for a week, which was considered a major event in Britain. People from all over came to watch the spectacle, and the streets were almost crowded. From an economic point of view, this is naturally excellent, but from the point of view of enjoying life, it feels a bit stingy. Life in Eastern Europe is extremely difficult now. Many artists cannot make a living in their own countries and have fled to France in search of a way out. Every evening at sunset, along the banks of the Seine, you can see ragged artists selling paintings and singing. A friend pointed out to me that many of them had fled from Hungary. The reason why they are willing to stay in Paris is probably not just the proximity of the water and the geographical proximity, but also because only in Paris can they find patrons and find a paradise for artists at the end of their road.

### Cash Compensation for Goods and Relief Loans; Measures for Compensation of Wartime Ship Losses Announced; Shipping Administration Bureau Investigates a Total of 408 Lost Ships

The government authorities have decided to compensate for wartime ship losses. The measures were telegraphed yesterday by the Ministry of Communications to the Shanghai Shipping Administration Bureau for implementation: (1) For those requisitioned for military use or for blocking projects, cash compensation will be made in accordance with the provisions of the Military Requisition Law, plus a profit of 5% weekly interest. The compensation standard will be based on the ship value reported at the time of ship registration. The compensation may be calculated based on price indexes and depreciation due to the age of the ship. The compensation obtained must be used for the purpose of building ships; otherwise, the compensation will be recovered. For requisitioned ships with no registered ship value or incomplete registration documents, the Ministry of Communications will hire experts to form a compensation assessment committee to assess the value. (2) For those damaged by the enemy during military or official missions and unable to be recovered, or if recovered but unusable, the government will provide cash compensation. If they can be salvaged and repaired for use, compensation will be provided for the salvage and repair costs. (3) Commercial ships damaged during the war may apply to the government for loans. According to the results of the Shipping Administration Bureau's investigation, a total of 92 ships, totaling 130,597 tons, were requisitioned by the government during the war to block blockade lines and were damaged in military or official missions. The government will fully compensate for these ships. The remaining 316 ships damaged during the war, totaling more than 166,500 tons, will be provided with loans by the government for relief based on the actual situation.

### Shi Yaomin Executed for Defection and Collaboration After Unsuccessful Attempt to Turn Against Enemy

Military traitor Shi Yaomin, originally from Yixing, Jiangsu, 39 years old, defected to the enemy. During the Japanese occupation of Shanghai, he was ordered to infiltrate the 63rd Division of the puppet army for counter-propaganda work. Unexpectedly, the criminal was enticed by generous rewards and defected to the enemy. Together with his subordinates, Fan Jin, Zhou Wenbin, and other traitors, he killed underground comrades, destroyed Jiang Bocheng's secret radio station in Shanghai, killed three Shanghai action personnel, including Zhang Fei, and led the enemy to attack Changyu and other places in Yixing. After the victory, he was arrested by military authorities. The criminal was executed yesterday in Song Park.

### Yan Qingxiang, General Manager of Cotton Mill, Continued to be Tried Yesterday for Suspected Collaboration; Indictment Lists Four Charges; Li Hanqing Sentenced to Five Years in Prison

[Report from This Newspaper] Yan Qingxiang, 48 years old, from Shanghai, General Manager of the Su Lun Cotton Mill in Suzhou, was accused of being a traitor. During the investigation by the High Prosecutor's Office, he was allowed to be released on bail with a cash guarantee of 20 million yuan. After formal indictment, the High Court conducted a preliminary hearing on August 19. After investigation, the court considered the charges to be serious and ordered him to be detained again in court. The court continued the trial yesterday afternoon. After questioning, it was ordered to reschedule the hearing.

The charges listed in the indictment can be roughly divided into four points: (1) He served as a consultant to the puppet Ministry of Industry and Commerce. (2) He procured textiles and yarn for the enemy army on behalf of the "China-Japan Trade Federation." (3) He served as a supervisor of the puppet Cotton Control Committee. (4) In the spring of the 34th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1945], he attended the puppet National People's Congress in the name of Yan Ji, a representative from Jiangsu Province. The defendant's testimony in court yesterday was largely the same as last time. He stated that after the enemy occupied Suzhou in the winter of the 26th year [i.e. 1937], the Su Lun Cotton Mill was taken over and managed by the enemy's Inland and Foreign Cotton Yarn Mill. During that time, the puppet Restoration Government invited him to serve as the Director of the puppet Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction, but he declined. Later, Wu Yanong obtained a letter of appointment as a consultant from the puppet Ministry of Industry and Commerce through deception. The Shanghai office of the ministry negotiated with the enemy's Asia Development Board, and he was able to recover the cotton mill in March of the 30th year [i.e. 1941]. However, the title of the puppet position was fictitious. He requested the court to investigate whether the puppet Ministry of Industry and Commerce had such a title in its organizational structure. The Cotton Control Committee was established in the autumn of the 30th year [i.e. 1941] by the cotton mill associations of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces. Its purpose was purely to facilitate unified procurement, purchase, and distribution, and it had nothing to do with the puppet Commercial Control Committee. He was elected as a supervisor and requested to resign, so he never went. In the summer of the 33rd year [i.e. 1944], the enemy army planned to destroy the non-operational machines and use the iron for military needs. After discussions by the cotton mill associations of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, each cotton mill weaved textiles and yarn for the "China-Japan Trade Federation" to avoid damage to the machines. The Su Lun Cotton Mill was assigned 300 bales of cotton yarn and 14,880 pieces of cloth. The raw materials were supplied by the association, the electricity was allocated by the association, and the wages were also issued by the association. The batch of textiles was originally scheduled to be delivered in the 33rd year [i.e. 1944], but the delivery was delayed until July of the 34th year [i.e. 1945], when it was still not fully delivered. After the victory, the goods were transferred to the Suzhou Office of the Central Trust Bureau on March 11 of this year. Regarding the matter of being a representative of the puppet Jiangsu Province, in the spring of the 34th year [i.e. 1945], the puppet National People's Congress was held in Nanjing. At that time, the defendant lived in Suzhou. Ren Yuandao, the puppet governor of Jiangsu Province, sent someone to invite him to attend. Because there was a radio transmitter of the 25th Army Group at his home, he feared being implicated. Under their coercion, he attended the opening day in the name of Yan Ji. He returned to Suzhou the next day due to illness, etc. Yesterday, Yan was wearing a gray long gown, black leather shoes, and Western-style trousers. He wore glasses and had shaved off his long beard. After the court session, he was returned to Zhongjian Prison.

Li Hanqing, the Director of the Puppet Jiangsu Tobacco and Alcohol Stamp Tax Collection Office, was sentenced to five years of imprisonment by the High Court yesterday, with five years of deprivation of civil rights. All of his property was confiscated, except for the necessary living expenses for his family. In addition, the case of Hungarian Yilizi, accused of providing alcohol to the enemy, was investigated and rescheduled for another hearing.

### Li Kaichen and Zhang Yinghui to Be Sentenced This Morning

[Report from This Newspaper] Zhou Bangjun, the former General Manager of China-West Pharmaceutical Company, who has already been sentenced to three years of imprisonment for collaborating with the enemy, is currently detained in Shanghai Prison. Yesterday afternoon, at the request of the Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau, the High Court brought Zhou from prison to investigate his assets. He was asked whether the China United Pharmaceutical Research Institute, located in the Minyi Amusement Park on Xinzha Road in this city, belonged to him. Zhou replied that the institute was jointly established by his eldest son, Zhou Wentong, and several classmates. The capital was small, and it was purely for research purposes. He usually did not advise them. He was then escorted back to prison by the bailiffs.

### Du Baoqi, Chief Prosecutor of the High Court, Goes to Beijing for Instructions

The bureau decided to convene the heads of the cotton cloth and woolen thread trade associations and representatives of several manufacturers this morning to discuss the evaluation of cotton cloth and woolen thread prices. It is said that the organization of the evaluation committee will be discussed first.

### Social Affairs Bureau Explains Three Labor-Management Issues

The Shanghai Branch of the China Industrial Association, with the approval of the Ministry of Social Affairs, has provided detailed explanations regarding labor-management issues. The key points are excerpted below: (1) Regarding the issue of workers' treatment, the ministry has formulated "Measures for Wage Adjustment in Private Enterprises during the Post-Rehabilitation Period," which adjusts wages based on the base-period wage and the workers' cost-of-living index. However, for wages with a base period of the 26th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1937], those exceeding 50 yuan may be issued with a reduced percentage. Furthermore, when adjusting or after adjusting wages in various industries in accordance with these measures, if the production and operating conditions are not good and it is indeed not possible to pay wages according to the workers' cost-of-living index, the reduction in wages may be determined through labor-management consultation or by the arbitration committee. (2) Regarding the issue of workers' right to strike, the law has strict restrictions on workers' right to strike. (3) Workers are not allowed to interfere with the factory's management rights under any pretext. The Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau is ordered to strictly prohibit this. However, to promote labor-management coordination and increase production efficiency, factory meetings should be held in accordance with the provisions of the Factory Law.

In addition, Jiang Biao, Director of the Materials Supply Bureau, is scheduled to go to Beijing today for official business and will return to Shanghai that evening.

### Participating in the Investigation Team: Five Councilors Hold a Symposium and Publish a Report to Speakers Pan and Xu

[Our Newspaper's Report] City Councilors Zhao Junhao, He Yuanming, Wu Jian'e, Zhu Xuefan, and Ma Junshuo have only attended several routine meetings since being recommended to participate in the work of the Investigation Team. All the work of the team had already commenced, and had been assigned to several committee members. After they joined the team, they only participated in discussions regarding the Municipal Government's acceptance of enemy and puppet automobiles, which were allocated to Wan Tai for discounted repairs, and the Municipal Government's disposal of materials from the puppet Central Market. There were no other cases assigned to them, causing the representatives to deeply feel that they had not been able to achieve any performance in their work since joining the team. The five councilors held a symposium yesterday and published a report to Speaker Pan Gongzhan and Deputy Speaker Xu Jiquan. The original text is as follows:

Allegations are Inaccurate

"We joined the Investigation Team for the Reception and Handling of Enemy and Puppet Materials in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Regions. On September 21st, we submitted a report to the meeting. Now that the team has concluded its work, we are submitting the following supplementary report: (1) Regarding the process of being assigned to participate in the Investigation Team's work: We accepted our appointment to the team, recognizing the importance of the mission. During the first meeting, we unanimously stated our hope that the team would provide specific instructions for cases that had already been handled, and that Director Zhang would assign work for unfinished cases. At that time, Director Zhang only brought up the Municipal Government's acceptance of enemy and puppet automobiles, which were allocated to Wan Tai for discounted repairs, and the Municipal Government's disposal of materials from the puppet Central Market. No other matters were mentioned, and all other work had already been assigned to other committee members. Therefore, we had no way to start. No other cases were brought up during the second and third meetings either. (2) Regarding the Puppet Central Market case: This case was decided to be transferred to the court for handling during a routine meeting on September 18th. Director Zhang designated Jian'e, Yuanming, and Junshuo to research the legal and accounting aspects and formulate opinions. Jian'e and Junshuo believed that the nature of this case was mostly related to administrative penalties. Yuanming originally intended to investigate the accounts, but all the accounts had already been sent to the Audit Office for review, making it impossible to access them. Subsequently, at a continued meeting on September 27th, we formally presented an oral report, and all attending committee members unanimously resolved to make a final decision on this case, which was recorded in the minutes. The reports stating that we 'undertook a thorough investigation but received no response' and that 'the written opinion has not been submitted to this day' are completely inconsistent with the facts. The contents of this case will be officially announced by the Investigation Team in the future."

Zhang Zhiben Issues a Statement

Furthermore, Director Zhang Zhiben of the Investigation Team was quite surprised to read in several newspapers the previous day that city councilors had joined the Investigation Team but had no work to do, and that Director Zhang had supposedly entrusted a case of the Central Market for thorough investigation, but no results had been seen, etc. Yesterday, he specifically stated to the representatives that this was not the case. He had not been to the team's office on Monday afternoon of this week, nor had he ever stated the aforementioned matters to reporters. He urged the representatives not to misunderstand.

### Isoya Rensuke and Tani Hisao Escorted to Nanjing by Train Last Night

[Our Newspaper's Report] Former Governor-General of Hong Kong Isoya Rensuke and Governor-General of Taiwan Tani Hisao were requested by the Chinese government to be extradited and brought to trial from the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers in Japan after the victory. On August 1st of this year, a special plane was dispatched from Japan to escort them to Shanghai, where they were imprisoned in the Shanghai Prison War Criminals Detention Center. At 4:20 PM yesterday, personnel from the First Pacification Area Military Tribunal went to the Shanghai Prison to take the two men and escorted them to Nanjing by night train. They will be publicly tried in Nanjing in the near future.

Yuan Sheng Flour Mill Hoarding Flour; Social Bureau Conducts Thorough Investigation

Recently, the price of flour in the city has increased from 14,000 yuan to 17,000 yuan per bag. This kind of fluctuation is improper. Mayor Wu has already given earnest advice during a meeting with various trade associations a few days ago, and ordered the Social Bureau to instruct the flour industry association to notify all flour mills not to raise prices. Violators will be severely punished. Most flour mills have complied, and flour prices have begun to fall. However, it was discovered yesterday that Yuan Sheng Flour Mill at No. 290 Wusong Road violated the order by selling on the black market for exorbitant profits, falsely claiming to customers that there was no flour available. An investigation revealed that the mill had stockpiled as many as 1,465 bags of flour. In addition to detaining the flour, the Municipal Government has ordered the Social Bureau to conduct a thorough investigation and report the findings for further action.

### Architectural Society to Hold Annual Meeting the Day After Tomorrow

The Chinese Architectural Society, founded in 1927, is a national technical research organization. Its members are all famous architects in the country. During the war, the society's headquarters moved west to Chongqing and continued to promote various businesses. After the victory, the society's headquarters moved back to the capital and earnestly reorganized its affairs, recruited new members, and complied with the laws and regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs. Members who did not go to the rear during the war must reapply for membership, otherwise their membership would be revoked. In addition to setting up a headquarters in Nanjing, the society also re-established a branch in Shanghai. Currently, there are eighty members. It is learned that the council meeting of the society has resolved to hold the society's 35th annual meeting at 9:00 AM on the 5th (Saturday) in the auditorium on the fourth floor of the Bank of China Building at No. 23 The Bund, Shanghai. In addition to discussing business rules, draft architectural regulations, architectural education, and other issues, there will also be speeches on urban planning, the current situation of European and American architecture, low-income housing and residential spaces, etc. In addition, directors, supervisors, and staff will be elected, and a new member induction ceremony will be held. An evening social gathering will also be held. This annual meeting of the society is the first grand event after the victory, and it coincides with the beginning of my country's construction, which is of profound significance.

### Deteriorating Coal Quality Affects Production; Gas Company Encounters Difficulties; Urges Users to Conserve as Much as Possible

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Gas Company is currently encountering great difficulties. The quality of coal allocated to the company by the Fuel Management Committee is deteriorating, which is greatly affecting production. It is heard that the Public Utilities Bureau is trying to procure coal of better quality on behalf of the company. The company urges all users to conserve to the minimum extent possible. The current gas limit is 45 degrees per household, which is 4,500 cubic feet. For the time being, the limit will not be reduced.

### Wear Short Clothes, Eat Brown Rice, Walk, and Send Simple Gifts: Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Drafts Thrift Regulations for Merchants

The Shanghai Municipal Thrift Movement Committee previously resolved to send separate letters to various organizations to draft thrift regulations individually. It has successively received various draft thrift regulations from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Municipal Agricultural Association, Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, Municipal Education Association, Municipal Women's Association, etc., which have been transferred to the Social Bureau, filed separately, and the relevant organizations have been notified to earnestly implement them. It is learned that the thrift regulations for merchants drafted by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce are as follows: (1) Clothing: The principle is not to make new clothes. Advocate short clothes, such as Zhongshan suits, student uniforms, youth uniforms, etc., which can reduce the use of clothing materials and invigorate the spirit. However, they must be washed frequently to maintain cleanliness. (2) Diet: Eating fatty and fresh foods every day does not supplement health. Eating more vegetables, plain tea, and simple meals is very hygienic. Brown rice is rich in nutrients and contains abundant vitamin B, and it is also more filling, so it should be vigorously promoted. In addition, proper banquets should be limited to ten people per table, four dishes and four bowls, one snack, and one soup. (3) Housing: The urban population is concentrated, and housing is difficult. The dispersal should be promoted, and people should move to the suburbs and Pudong, etc., which can avoid the suffering of overcrowding and have sufficient sunlight and air, which can greatly improve health and reduce disease and fatigue. Fire accidents are also an important way to save money. (4) Walking: For daily work, if the journey is not very far, you can walk. In addition, you can take a tram or have your own bicycle is best, which can exercise the body, save time and money, develop working habits, and change social atmosphere. (5) Other: Everything should be based on thrift, and extravagance should be avoided. For example, in interpersonal relations, regardless of weddings, funerals, or celebrations, all proper gifts should be limited to 10,000 legal tender. All should be in cash to ensure practical use. We must ensure that everyone is diligent and thrifty, then the restoration of industry and commerce can be expected soon, and the national construction work will surely be completed soon.

### British Tram Company to Restore Two Trolleybus Lines

The vehicles owned by the British Tram Company were severely damaged during the enemy and puppet period. At that time, overseas transportation was blocked, and all tram parts and tires could not be purchased. Therefore, new tram and trolleybus vehicles have disappeared in recent years, and old vehicles are becoming less and less day by day. After the victory, the city's population has increased sharply, and public transportation is extremely congested. The company has purchased 600 new tires from abroad, and 180 tires have arrived in Shanghai and are stored in warehouses. The old vehicles will be repaired and assembled soon, and the No. 20 and No. 18 trolleybus lines will be restored first. Line 20 runs between Jing'an Temple, Fuzhou Road, and the Bund, and Line 18 runs between the North Railway Station and Xieqiao, because these two lines are the most congested with passengers, which is intended to alleviate the situation slightly.

### Careless Fire in Nanshi Shantytown

At around 2:15 PM yesterday, a fire broke out due to carelessness, burning down twenty-one houses in an instant. The fire was extinguished by the fire department, which dispatched vehicles to the scene. The arsonist has fled and is at large. The police are currently investigating.

### Recent Activities of the Red Cross: Setting Up Free Clinics for the Poor, Distributing Winter Clothing, Establishing Children's Nutrition Stations, and Evening Remedial Classes

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] The name of the Red Cross is familiar to the public, but the origin, organization, nature, and mission of the Red Cross have not been widely noticed. Why do all countries in the world have Red Cross societies? And why are the flags all white with a red cross? Who was the first to raise this banner?

The Red Cross originated in Geneva, Switzerland. In 1859, Swiss man Henry Dunant returned to his country from North Africa. He passed through the battlefield of Solferino during the Italo-French War. He witnessed the battlefield full of dead and wounded, groaning and wailing, blood spilling over the fields, which was extremely tragic. He specially mobilized the nearby people and passing merchants to jointly provide relief, comforting the wounded and burying the dead. Afterwards, he traveled to various European countries to promote his idea of saving the dying and healing the wounded. After several international conferences were convened and international conventions were signed, Red Cross societies were established in various countries. Representatives of various countries, in order to express their respect for Switzerland, specially stipulated the reverse of the Swiss flag – white with a red cross – as the symbol for saving the wounded and sick. Since then, the white flag with a red cross has represented the noble ideals of universal love, peace, and serving society. Because the Red Cross flag flies wherever countless people are rescued, the Red Cross symbol is increasingly respected. According to a 1939 survey, there were Red Cross societies in sixty-one countries around the world, with hundreds of millions of members, which means that one out of every thirty people is a member of the Red Cross. The Chinese Red Cross Society was originally one of them. It was established in 1904 during the Russo-Japanese War, and has a history of forty-two years. However, in the past, due to various limitations and insufficient publicity, very few people formally joined as members. After the restoration, the Red Cross executives who returned to Shanghai made efforts to solicit members. Now, in Shanghai alone, the number of members has expanded to 60,000. However, this number is considered too small by the heads of the American Red Cross. In New York City, more than half of the citizens are members of the Red Cross.

Each country's Red Cross has its branches, ranging from dozens to thousands. Our Chinese Red Cross had 512 branches before the war. During the Anti-Japanese War, they suffered from the enemy and puppets' mutilation, annihilation, or loss of contact. The losses were extremely huge. About 70 branches have successively returned. It is expected that the number of branches will increase by at least four or five times in the following year.

The Red Cross is a folk service organization. Its former mission was "Universal Love, Caring for Soldiers, Saving the Dying, and Healing the Wounded." Now its mission has expanded. It not only provides rescue during wartime, but also promotes social service work in peacetime. It is the savior of the poor and sick. But unfortunately, in Shanghai, there is only one Red Cross society that truly serves the poor and sick, which is located at No. 856 Xinzha Road, in an old-fashioned, dilapidated house.

The general secretary of the society is Gu Xinpu. The main responsible persons include Executive Tong Xingxingmen, Executive and Service Section Chief Wang Wan, and others. They are all a group of people who dedicate their lives to social service and work silently. Currently, they are carrying out many charitable activities, of which the most important are the following four tasks: (1) Free Medical Clinics for the Poor - Only a registration fee of 200 yuan is charged, and a follow-up visit is 100 yuan. Medicines are free. About three to four hundred people seek treatment every day, with surgical cases accounting for the majority, and Dr. Wang Renhou Song Sheng personally diagnoses and treats them in the clinic. (2) Children's Nutrition Station - The society independently prepares 300 boxes of fresh milk. In addition to regularly distributing it to patients with lung diseases and malnutrition (must be certified by the society's doctor) for free drinking, a children's nutrition service station is specially established. Every day from 8:00 AM to 10:00 AM, diluted milk is provided free of charge. About 400 poor children go to drink every day. (3) Distribution of Winter Clothing - The society received a large number of relief winter clothing from the American Red Cross, including 900 pairs of boys' pants, 195 woolen sweaters, 400 cloth pajamas, and sets of girls' tops and triangular pants. In addition, there are 600 packages of infant supplies. Because these relief clothes are too elaborate, for example, the contents of the infant supplies packages are all brand-new flannel materials, including diapers, blankets, pajamas, coats, etc., which even middle- and upper-class Chinese children can hardly enjoy. Therefore, this makes it difficult for the personnel responsible for the distribution. If they are distributed to the extremely poor, they are afraid that they will not even know how to use them, and even more afraid that they will resell them in the market, which will affect the reputation of the Chinese Red Cross. Therefore, they have spent a lot of thought and gone through a lot of procedures in selecting the recipients. In addition to entrusting various hospitals in the city to distribute them according to actual needs, there are still some remaining. They must ensure that they are distributed to those who really need them. (4) Evening Remedial Classes - The original purpose of the establishment was to provide young members, such as apprentices, with the opportunity to make up for their studies in their spare time. However, as a result, out-of-school children accounted for the majority. This semester, tuition fees have skyrocketed, and the children of ordinary working-class families cannot afford to continue their studies. In addition to only being able to sigh at the school gate, the desire for knowledge led them to find this place. After paying a registration fee of 2,000 yuan, they can make up for their studies for two hours every night. Textbook fees and miscellaneous fees are all free. The teachers are all volunteers and only receive 50,000 to 60,000 yuan for transportation expenses. Because there are many people who want to enroll, the society has used the office and waiting room as temporary classrooms.

Mr. Wang, the chief of the Service Section of the society, told reporters: Seeing the large number of poor people in China who need help, there should be at least ten pure charitable organizations like this in Shanghai, but so far, there is only this one society. The society has a remaining fund of 20 million, but they don't know how many services they need to do!

After the reporter visited the Shanghai Branch of the Red Cross, in addition to just increasing endless emotion, I only felt that Executive Tong Xingxingmen, who is 58 years old, is still running around day and night for those poor and sick people. How should the younger generation be alerted!

### Land Registration in the City Limited to the End of This Month; Land Value Tax to be Levied from November

[Our Newspaper's Report] Director of the Land Administration Bureau Zhu Ping and Director of the News Office Zhu Xubai hosted a reception for the city's news media at the New Life Recreation Club at 7:00 PM last night. More than a dozen reporters from various newspapers attended. During the reception, Director Zhu reported that land administration work is often regarded as a cold field by the general public, but in fact, land administration is the implementation of land policy and is closely related to local autonomy, so it is not a cold field. The land registration in the six districts of the city is limited to the end of October. Those who fail to register before the deadline or fail to explain the reasons will be considered ownerless land and will be taken over by the public. However, when paying taxes, they will still need to pay a fine. As for foreign land, it must be handled separately due to treaty relations. According to the order of the Executive Yuan, land value tax must be levied this year, and will begin in November. The tax rate will be 15 per mille according to the central government's regulations, and the total amount will be 3 billion. The price will be evaluated by the evaluation committee after declaration and investigation. The central government stipulates that representatives from nine institutions should form the committee: the Municipal Council (Speaker Pan Gongzhan), the Municipal Chamber of Commerce (Xu Jiquan), the Local Court (Cha Gengjian), the Federation of Trade Unions (Shui Xiangyun), the Education Association (Zhou Feicheng), the Bankers Association, the Farmers Association, the Finance Bureau, and the Public Works Bureau, plus the Land Administration Bureau, a total of ten units.

Director Zhu also explained the land registration procedures. Land registration takes a long time and the procedures are cumbersome, with a total of sixteen steps: 1. Check the map. 2. Sign the drawing. 3. Fill in the application form. 4. Collect registration fees. 5. Check the documents. 6. Collect the documents. 7. Issue a receipt. 8. Mark the points. 9. Review. 10. Complete the procedures. 11. Public announcement. 12. Formal registration. 13. Map. 14. Issue the ownership certificate. 15. Match the map. 16. Issue the registration certificate. According to the law, the public announcement must be made for two months. If there is no objection, formal registration can be made. If there is a dispute, there will be more trouble. Finally, Director Zhu explained the case of Zhou Songqian impersonating a representative of the Pudong Township.

During the meeting, Zheng Huang, the chief of the Deed Examination Section of the Land Administration Bureau, reported on the work of deed examination. Among them, Dao Deeds and imitation registration are the most troublesome. Dao Deeds are issued by the Daohe Yamen, but many of them involve property owned by Chinese people. Moreover, some of them were disposed of by the enemy, so there are many questions. Imitation registration was issued in 1855, which was a long time ago. It has been sold and resold, so the imitation registration is different from the grain string. It is also very cumbersome to check and verify the customs documents.

### Defrauded 80 Million and Fled; Two Zhuang Partners Detained and Sent to Court

Hechang Shenzhuang, located at No. 13 Beilingli, Jinling Road, is owned by Huang Wusheng from Chaozhou. Its business is mainly to transport and sell various Chinese and foreign goods to the inland areas. Recently, Huang ordered a large number of domestic goods from Xinhua Cotton Mill and other domestic goods manufacturers, issuing bad checks totaling more than 80 million. When the manufacturers went to collect the money on the 26th of last month, they could not find it, so they negotiated with Huang. Unexpectedly, Huang Yusheng had already fled without a trace, and even his wives and concubines were gone. The factories reported to the Huangpu Police Station, which arrested Huang's partners Xu Shizhang and Guo Jinwang. After interrogation, they were transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for interrogation yesterday morning.

### Specific Measures for Overseas Chinese Returning to Malaya Have Been Agreed Upon; Offices Set Up in Fuzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, and Guangzhou to Handle Procedures

Regarding the procedures for overseas Chinese returning to the country and the issue of repatriation, there has been no specific plan announced due to the pending decision of the government of the place of residence and the UNRRA. It is learned that regarding the entry procedures for overseas Chinese and technicians returning to Malaya, the following results have been reached after detailed discussions between our Consul General in Singapore and UNRRA representative Clark and the Director of the Singapore Immigration Department: (1) For overseas Chinese returning to Malaya, in addition to obtaining a lotus license, the visa procedures will be simplified. UNRRA will be entrusted by the Singapore Immigration Department to set up offices in Fuzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, and Guangzhou to handle the procedures on their behalf. When arriving in Singapore by ship, the Immigration Department will verify the names. If it is confirmed that they lived in Singapore before and have not been deported, they can disembark. (3) The first batch of technicians will be sent back to the country first. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission has sent the list of technicians, which has been forwarded to the Immigration Bureau and fully approved for entry. (3) After the technicians arrive in Singapore, the Nanyang Overseas Chinese General Association will bear the cost of returning to their original place of residence and will handle all the procedures on their behalf. As for whether the overseas Chinese registered in the Shanghai area will be repatriated by UNRRA to the above four ports for concentration or directly repatriated from Shanghai, the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Office has requested instructions from the central government.

### Truck Speeding and Injuring a Child

At 5:40 PM yesterday, a truck with license number 42084 was speeding along Jiangpu Road and North Jin Road in Pudong, knocking down a child named Fang Afu who was playing by the roadside. His leg was broken, and his right eyeball fell out of its socket, with blood flowing all over the ground. The nearby police officers detained the drivers Chen Dawen and Li Kuicai for interrogation and sent the injured person to the Pudong Hospital for treatment. However, his injuries were too serious and his life is in danger.

### UNRRA Distributes Cod Liver Oil

The UNRRA Shanghai Branch recently received a batch of high-quality cod liver oil. The association decided to distribute it to those in the city who suffer from lung disease and poor nutrition. Poor lung disease patients in various hospitals and clinics, malnourished children in children's shelters and charitable organizations, and malnourished students in public and private primary schools and kindergartens can apply to the association. The application period is until the 10th of this month. Each person can only apply once. Distribution will be on the 16th of this month. Each person can receive 45 grams. Other lung disease patients and malnourished children who hold distribution permits within the scope of the cod liver oil and milk powder distribution station run by the association can request distribution with their certificates.

### Zhongshan Hospital in Fenglin Bridge to Admit Patients from the 7th

[Our Newspaper's Report] Zhongshan Hospital in Fenglin Bridge, the largest hospital in the city with a capacity of 400 beds, will begin admitting patients on the 7th of this month.

During the occupation, Zhongshan Hospital was converted into an army hospital by the Japanese. After the victory, it was successively stationed by the US military and our army. When the Medical Treatment Business Committee sent personnel to take over, not only was the equipment inside completely gone, but also the doors, windows, water, and electricity were all damaged. Only a dilapidated shell remained. Although it has been assisted by the donation of Kong Xiangxi, chairman of the Board of Directors of the Medical Treatment Business, and the Shanghai Medical College First Red Cross Hospital Aftermath Relief and Relief Administration, the financial resources are still insufficient to fully restore it. Only the ground floor and the second floor of the six-story palace-style building have been repaired. Therefore, after the resumption of business on the 7th of this month, it can only accommodate 120 to 130 patients. The outpatient clinic will not be able to start until the beginning of November. The hospital hopes that all sectors of society can continue to donate so that all 400 beds can be restored.

President Shen Kefei has served as Deputy Director of the Ministry of Health, President of Chongqing Central Hospital, and President of Nanjing Central Hospital. The hospital's doctors and nurses have established close contact with Shanghai Medical College and the First Hospital of the Red Cross and will be temporarily transferred.

### Nineteen Hidden Japanese Soldiers Arrested in Jiangwan, Increased Security at POW Camp

[Report from our Newspaper] Nineteen Japanese soldiers were recently discovered hiding near the Jiangwan branch of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry’s experimental farm. They were in a disheveled state. Several of them were fluent in Chinese and begged for food in the vicinity disguised as beggars. Eventually, local residents noticed and reported them to the Prisoner of War Management Office of the Ministry of National Defense. On the morning of the 27th of last month at 11:00 a.m., personnel were dispatched along with military police to arrest them. After interrogation, it was found that some were war criminals.

### Relief Supplies Shipped to Disaster Areas, September Breaks Records

The quantity of materials shipped by the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA) to disaster areas in other provinces in September broke all previous records, reaching an all-time high. The amount of supplies shipped domestically by CRRRA in September was equal to the amount of goods received from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA). In September, UNRRA shipped 131,310 tons of materials by sea. The total amount shipped by CRRRA to other ports and distributed in Shanghai was 121,772 tons. The difference between the two is negligible. Compared to the shipping volume in August, there was an increase of 27,500 tons.

Furthermore, in the week from September 21st to 27th, the relief materials shipped by CRRRA to various disaster areas in other provinces amounted to 21,175.5 tons, and the amount distributed locally in Shanghai was 9,908.9 tons, totaling 31,084.4 tons.

Other items included clothing at 88.3 tons, agricultural equipment at 1,526.2 tons, industrial equipment at 419.3 tons, medical equipment at 87.4 tons, and maintenance items at 1.7 tons.

### Impoverished Craftsman Rescued After River Suicide Attempt, Drowning of Child Leads to Five-Year Sentence

[Report from our Newspaper] Li Yuanyuan, a plasterer from Changshu, lost his wife early in life. After coming to this city, he began cohabitating with his fellow villager, Li Qiaozhen. They had a four-year-old son named Lingling. After the victory [over Japan], Li Yuanyuan became unemployed and lived on usurious loans, making life extremely difficult. Lingling contracted a lung disease, and Li could not afford treatment. On August 6th of this year, Li Yuanyuan and his concubine quarreled over the lack of rice to cook. Li Yuanyuan felt hopeless about the future and decided to take his own life. That night, he took Lingling and jumped into the Huangpu River to commit suicide. Fortunately, someone discovered them and rescued Li Yuanyuan, but Lingling had already drowned. The District Procuratorate filed a public prosecution, and the trial concluded yesterday with a verdict: Li Yuanyuan was found guilty of murder and sentenced to five years in prison.

### Leases, Sales, and Transfers of Property Confiscated from Traitors After Victory Declared Invalid, 595 Buildings Confiscated from Traitors, Occupied by Various People, Some with Six or Seven Units Sharing One House

[Report from our Newspaper] Regarding the measures for handling properties confiscated from traitors, the reporter has learned that the principles have been decided, but they still need to be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. The property rights and lease rights of all private houses belonging to traitors should be sealed, seized, managed, and used. After seizure, the Central Trust Bureau should be immediately notified to take over the custody. As for how to use them, it should be approved by the handling bureau and entrusted to the trust bureau for management. All sales, leases, or transfers of property confiscated from traitors after August 11, 1945, are invalid. As for those before August 11, 1945, the lease should be renewed with the Trust Bureau. Those who occupy without authorization will be ordered to move out and must pay back rent.

Regarding the properties confiscated from traitors, a total of 595 buildings have been found. There are 15 private houses of traitors that are currently occupied by the traitors themselves, including those who have rented or borrowed a portion of the property from the traitor's family without approval. A total of 298 buildings were rented out by traitors before the victory. This is based on what the current tenants and neighbors say, and many have not produced leases. A total of 57 buildings have been temporarily occupied with the approval of the Central Party Headquarters, the Ministry of Finance, the Municipal Government, the Third Front Army, the handling bureau, and the Military Intelligence Bureau. There are 87 buildings that have been forcibly occupied, including those occupied without approval or those with leases after the victory. As for the houses leased by traitors, 74 buildings are entirely occupied by the traitors themselves. 44 buildings are partially occupied by the traitors themselves. 15 buildings have been temporarily occupied with approval, and 5 buildings have been forcibly occupied.

According to reporters, the private houses of traitors currently occupied by family members include: Lu Ying, 57 Fuli Road. Chen Zi, 12, Lane 643, Seymour Road. Xie Baosheng, 26, Lane 636, Xiaoshadu Road. Zhou Bangjun, 1000 Xinzha Road. Zhu Bojing, 640 Haige Road.

As for the houses that have been forcibly occupied, the situation of the occupying entities is quite complex, and there are many cases where six or seven units share one building.

Reporters recently learned from various sources that the garden villas of major traitors are currently being temporarily kept in custody by important party and government officials, and have been approved by the relevant departments. The following are some examples: Liang Hongzhi's villa at 150 Juxun Road is currently being kept in custody by Bai Chongxi. Chen Gongbo's villa at 33 West Aiensi Road is being kept in custody by a member of President Song's family. Shao Shijun's villa at 80 Aetang Road is being legally borrowed by the Municipal Party Headquarters. Luo Hongyi's house at 2, Lane 105, Fucaisson Road, is being kept in custody by Gu Zhutong.

### Improving Port Affairs, Adding Ten Buoys, Repairing Damaged Docks, Preventing Theft, Another Subcommittee Meeting to Discuss

The Shanghai Port Affairs Committee held its first meeting in the Municipal Government Conference Room at 10:00 a.m. yesterday. The attendees were: Mayor Wu Guozhen, Customs Director Zhang Fuyun, UNRRA Shanghai Branch Director Liu Hongsheng, Public Utilities Bureau Director Zhao Huijue, Public Works Bureau Director Zhao Zukang, Whangpoo Conservancy Bureau Director Ding Guitang, Deputy Director Shi Konghuai, Navigation Bureau Director Li Gufan, Ministry of Transportation Representative Song Xishang, Police Bureau Director Xuan Tiewu (represented by Fang Zhichao), Navy Headquarters Wei Jimin (represented by Tang Yonggen), Water Conservancy Committee Yang Naijun, Pilotage Committee Peng Chongwei, Resources Committee Zhu Tianbing, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Wei Huanzhang, Harbor Quarantine Office Dai Fangyuan, Committee Chief Secretary and Secretary Group Leader Xie Haoling, Naval Group Leader Yuan Jin, Inspection Group Leader Huang Younan, Investigation and Security Group Leader Zheng Zhongwei, and more than twenty others. Mayor Wu presided over the meeting, introduced the important officials of the committee, and then began discussing the issue of improving the berthing facilities for ships in the port. Marine Group Leader Yuan Jin stated:

(1) There are currently sixty major ship mooring buoys in the port, which is insufficient for actual needs. It is proposed to add ten Class A buoys in the second and third sections of the upstream area of the port to reduce berthing congestion. (2) There are approximately sixty-one docks in the port, of which seventeen have been damaged and are unusable. It is hoped that they can be repaired and restored to their original condition to increase berth space and alleviate warehouse congestion. (3) The docks in the Jinliyuan, Ning Shao, Dada, and Nanshi areas are mostly silted up and should be dredged as soon as possible to facilitate the berthing of inland river boats. (4) Many barges in the port are rented by UNRRA and it is hoped that they can be returned to the customs. Attendees fully expressed their opinions on the above issues. The chairman summarized the following: (1) Adding ten buoys is extremely necessary and the Marine Group should first inquire with the Materials Supply Bureau and UNRRA to see if there are any remaining materials that can be used, and then proceed with the approval process. (2) The repair of damaged docks is closely related to the Whangpoo Conservancy Bureau. It is proposed that the Marine Group investigate the detailed condition of each damaged dock, and the Whangpoo Conservancy Bureau should prepare a report on the water level measurements of each dock and submit it to the next meeting for discussion. The committee will notify the owners of the docks that are deemed urgently in need of repair, and set a deadline for completion. (3) The silted docks in the Nanshi area should be dredged as soon as possible to facilitate the berthing of Yangtze River inland vessels and avoid borrowing ocean-going wharf. This case is proposed to be studied by the Whangpoo Conservancy Bureau and then reviewed. (4) Regarding the return of barges by UNRRA, the damage to the barges during the eight years of the War of Resistance was extremely serious, and there is a real need to add more. Finally, the chairman reported that he would soon convene a subcommittee meeting of the Investigation and Security Group to study in detail the responsibilities and powers for cargo loading and unloading damage, as well as how to prevent theft, so as to submit it to the next general meeting for discussion. The meeting adjourned at approximately 11:00 a.m.

[Report from our Newspaper] Chen Fahua, the district head of the 19th Jia of the 8th Bao of the 14th District of this city, is from Yancheng, northern Jiangsu, is 49 years old, and lives at 16 Guangzhao Road. In July of this year, a young widow from his hometown, Chen Xiaonian, came to Shanghai to seek refuge and was staying at her relative's house at 22 Jinxiu Lane, Changan Road, Nanshi. Chen Fahua, seeing that Chen was a single woman who could be taken advantage of, used coercive and deceptive means, under the pretext of registering her household, to trick Chen into the Maigen Hotel on Maigen Road, where he forced her into sexual relations. He then tricked her into his home, where he cohabited with her. Chen Xiaonian had some savings in her hometown and had purchased two gold rings weighing more than four qian in total. Chen valued them greatly and kept them tied to her waistband day and night, never taking them off. On the morning of September 2nd, she suddenly discovered that the gold rings on her waistband were missing. When she questioned Chen Fahua, she was beaten violently. At this point, Chen Xiaonian could no longer tolerate it and reported to the police station, who transferred the case to the court. During the court hearing yesterday, Chen Xiaonian testified that Chen Fahua had considerable influence and had committed murder, for which he was sentenced to ten years in prison. Fearing future retaliation, she did not intend to accuse him of the seduction.

### Gasoline (Riverside Scene One)

Does anyone still remember the era of "a drop of gasoline, a drop of blood?" You, gasoline, once the darling of the powerful, where is your prestige now?

### Boxing and Death of Zang Da Erzi: Police Ordered to Arrest Perpetrator, Transferred to District Procuratorate for Trial Today

[Report from our Newspaper] On the late night of the 22nd of last month, a case occurred in front of the Huadu Hotel on Xikou Road, in which an American soldier boxing a rickshaw puller, Zang Da Erzi, resulted in his death. The passenger at the time was a Spaniard named Lai Lun Ouqie. Because the rickshaw reached its destination, he did not pay the fare and went directly into the dance hall to look for friends. The rickshaw puller waited for a long time, and Lai Lun finally came out with an American soldier. The deceased went forward to collect the fare, a conflict occurred, and he was punched by the American soldier, seriously injured and killed. Lai Lun was once brought to the police station by the police and ordered to hand over the murderer, but he did not comply. All parties are paying close attention to this matter. The Huangpu Police Branch was ordered yesterday to send personnel to investigate and summon the perpetrator Lai Lun Ouqie. Finally, at 6:00 p.m., Lai Lun was arrested on the Malis ship at Buoy No. 15 in the Huangpu River and taken to the police station. It is said that he will be transferred to the District Procuratorate this morning for trial according to law.

### Puppet Soldier Relies on Power to Forcibly Occupy Another Man's Wife, Ultimately Dies at the Hands of His Enemy, Shoes Blacking Has Other Motives, Tragedy Unfolds on Longmen Road

[Report from our Newspaper] Zhang Ronggen, a 38-year-old from Ningbo, married Li Xingqing, 34. After their marriage, they lived in their hometown. The relationship between the couple was good. They had one son and one daughter. Years ago, during the War of Resistance, Li Chunshan (41 years old, from Kaifeng), a soldier of a certain puppet army unit stationed in Ningbo, was lustful and coveted Zhang's wife, Li's beauty, and harbored evil intentions. Later, he took two soldiers to Zhang's residence and forcibly abducted his wife, hiding her without a trace.

At the time, Zhang reported the information to Li's superior, a certain regimental commander, but he was accused of slander and imprisoned for four days. Later, Li asked someone to invite Zhang to write an unconditional note, giving her to Chunshan. Zhang had to succumb to the lewd power and humiliate himself. After the victory, he came to Shanghai to investigate, and because it was difficult to find a job, he worked as a shoe shiner. Recently, he found out that Li was an old quartermaster at the Yufeng Egg Shop at 150 Da Zhan Road. Yesterday at around 1:35 p.m., Li went shopping with a trainee from the factory, Li Rongxiang. When they passed Longmen Road and Racecourse Road, Zhang spotted them. He took out a bull knife he had hidden, followed them, knocked Li to the ground, grabbed Li's chest, and stabbed him three times, one each in the head, throat, and left waist. Li fell to the ground and died. The trainee, Li Rongxiang, shouted loudly, and officers from the 2240th patrol of the Zhongzheng Road Police Station of the new branch heard the sound and arrived to arrest Zhang and take him to the branch. Li's body was taken to Renji Hospital and transferred to the autopsy room for examination.

### Silver Store Robbed in Western Shanghai

[Report from our Newspaper] At about 7 p.m. last night, four robbers suddenly broke into the Baohua Silver Store at 1819 Zhoujiaqiao, Changning Road, Western Shanghai. They falsely claimed to be exchanging ornaments, drew out guns, threatened the shop assistants and forbade them from making any noise. They robbed two large gold bars and more than one million yuan in cash from the cabinet and fled with the loot. Afterwards, the Zhoujiaqiao branch of the Xinjing Police Branch received a report and sent police to pursue, but they had already escaped without a trace.

### Rabid Dog Bite Leads to Death

Most of the employees of the Yong'an Second Yarn Factory on Changping Road in Western Shanghai are from Guangdong. A few days ago, a yellowish-gray wild dog passed by, and the workers started to catch it. During the roundup, a male worker was bitten in the leg by the dog and sent to the hospital, fortunately without any life-threatening injuries. The next day, the dog was found again outside the factory gate and was knocked down by a factory employee surnamed Guo with a shoulder pole. The rabid dog spat out venom and died shortly after. When Mr. Guo struck the dog, he used too much force, causing the tiger's mouth of his right hand to break and bleed. When he retracted the shoulder pole, he accidentally wiped the venom on the other end of the shoulder pole onto the wound on his right hand. Unexpectedly, the toxicity of the rabid dog suddenly broke out while Guo was resting at home the next day. He lay on the ground, foaming at the mouth, rolling and shouting, making the barking sounds of a rabid dog. When his family saw this, they panicked and lost their senses. Before they could send him to the hospital for emergency treatment, he died.

### Reader Responses - Medical and Health

(1) Persistent Cough

Jiang Hailing asks: My daughter is six years old and has been coughing for nearly fifty days. She was diagnosed by a doctor with whooping cough and injected with 3cc of whooping cough serum, and has also taken ordinary cough medicine, but all have been ineffective. I have several questions to ask for clarification: (1) Is it whooping cough that the child coughs lightly during the day and heavily at night, and vomits every time she coughs? (2) Is there a specific medicine for whooping cough in children? (3) Is the injection of whooping cough serum effective? (4) If left untreated, will it gradually heal?

[Answered by Dr. Yu Xinen, MD] Based on the described symptoms, it is whooping cough. Injecting serum as early as possible can reduce the symptoms, otherwise it is not easy to be effective. If you can take careful care, especially nutrition, it will heal by itself when the time comes.

(2) Headache in Pregnant Women

He Yun asks: Before my wife got married, she suffered from ear diseases, which occurred several times a year and were very painful when they occurred. After marriage, ear diseases occurred less frequently during pregnancy, but symptoms such as irritability and headache occurred successively. This is of course a disease that pregnant women should have. However, the headache is the most severe, often leading to neglect of eating and sleeping, and any operation cannot be supported. My wife has one son and one daughter. Every time she becomes pregnant, her health gradually deteriorates. This year she became pregnant again, and the headache is still the same as before. I don’t know what kind of disease it is? Is it related to ear disease? Or is it malnutrition? What medicine should I take?

[Answered by Dr. Yu Xinen, MD] Headaches and other diseases during pregnancy are symptoms of pregnancy toxemia. It is necessary to check blood pressure, fundus, urine, etc., and then diagnose and treat according to the situation after finding out the cause.

(3) Numbness in Right Wrist

Yan Qiujuan asks: When I was 19 years old, I noticed that my right wrist and five fingers were numb. It doesn't hurt or itch, but I have no strength to pick things up (such as chopsticks, sewing needles, and other common household chores). At first, due to economic reasons, I did not seek medical treatment. It has been ten years now. The symptoms are still the same, but the lower arm is slightly thinner than the left arm, and the skin on the fingers and palms is the same as on the right, only slightly thinner and tender. Please ask: (1) What is this disease? (2) Can it be cured? (3) Are there any internal medicines that I can buy and take myself?

[Answered by Dr. Yu Xinen, MD] What you are suffering from seems to be infantile paralysis. In the beginning, it can be treated with electrotherapy to prevent muscle decay, but it has been ten years and it is difficult to recover.

### City Chamber of Commerce Cables Ministry of Finance to Appeal for Salaried Workers: Income Tax Burden Too Heavy, Indirectly Encouraging Labor Unrest and Increasing the Sources of Chaos

[Reported by this newspaper] The City Chamber of Commerce believes that the new income tax law has increased too sharply and that the general salaried class cannot afford it, so it telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, saying: "Received a letter from the Shanghai Banking and Commerce Association, which said: 'Previously received a letter from the Chongqing Banking Association, which stated briefly that the newly promulgated revised income tax law stipulates that income from salaries and remuneration will be taxed from 50,000 yuan and above. The method of calculation is based on the actual income amount as the income amount. We believe that paying taxes is an obligation that the people should fulfill, but the tax exemption amount is too low. At a time when prices are soaring, the actual income of salaried personnel, when converted according to the price index, is very meager. It is not enough to maintain the minimum standard of living, let alone bear such a heavy tax burden. This matter concerns all sectors of the country. How should it be handled? We hope that your association will discuss it and reply.' Approved. It is true that the revised income tax rate for salaries and wages starts at 50,000 yuan, and the tax-free amount is indeed too low. At the same time, every employee whose income exceeds 240,000 yuan must pay 100 yuan in tax for every 1,000 yuan. There are many salaried personnel with a monthly income of 300,000 yuan, and the amount of income tax they have to pay is more than 13,990 yuan. This is equivalent to deducting nearly 5% from their already insufficient living expenses, which is no different from taking away two dou of rice from those who rely on their salaries for a living. Therefore, how to make the collection amount reasonable in the face of fluctuating currency values and rising prices is a matter that must be considered comprehensively. Otherwise, income tax, which is one of the best taxes, has provisions that are not comprehensive and detailed, but the signing of the tax rate is difficult to meet the actual situation. Implementation will harm people's livelihood, and cessation will damage national revenue. I think all industries have this confusion. Your association leads all industries and should consider this collective case as soon as possible. Therefore, I am sending this special letter to you, hoping that you will consider it and reply so that we can forward it.' Arrived at the meeting. It has been found that the currency value has changed too quickly and too much in recent years, and it is difficult to adapt to the changing state of each month if a fixed tax rate is proposed for salary and remuneration income. Currently, a salary of 300,000 yuan in Shanghai is difficult to maintain the household expenses of a family of several people. According to the current tax rate for deducting salary income, it is necessary to pay as much as 13,990 yuan in tax. On the employee's side, it is inevitable that they will be even more strained. Therefore, employees in various industries have already appealed for tax exemption. If the adjustment is not considered, the employees will be oppressed by heavy taxes and will have to increase their wages constantly as a remedy. This will only encourage labor unrest and increase the sources of social chaos. It has been found that the recent price ratio, taking food rice, which is important and has a relatively late price increase, as an example, is about 6,000 times that of the pre-war period. Therefore, the current salary of 300,000 yuan per month for industrial and commercial employees is approximately equal to 50 yuan before the war. Before the war, the income tax for the second category of salaries was tax-free for those under 30 yuan. From 30 yuan to 60 yuan, 5 cents of tax was levied for every 10 yuan. A salary of 50 yuan only bears an income tax of 1 dime and 5 cents. The current adjustment plan is to follow this precedent as much as possible, with the base salary of less than 30 yuan multiplied by the monthly cost of living index as the income tax exemption point. For salaries exceeding the tax exemption point, 5 cents of tax will be levied for every 10 yuan if the living index multiplied by the salary does not exceed the pre-war ratio of 60 yuan. The standard will be more reasonable, and the burden may be勉力. I hope that your ministry will consider and adopt it for implementation, which will be for the public good."

### Multi-Headed Competition to Close Out Positions, Gold and Banknotes All Fall

Yesterday, the interbank market was tight, with supply exceeding demand, and it fell slightly. The morning opening was around 2,175,000, and the high price did not exceed 2,178,000. After that, it lacked support and gradually softened. After 10:00 am, the central bank allocated 80 bars, and the price was reduced to 2,162,500. Afterwards, there was still no improvement, and the supply did not stop. Long positions were forced to close out, and the noon was the most unsustainable, falling to a low price of 2,140,000. In the afternoon, there were even more people who lowered prices to seek cash, and some even fell to 2,135,000 for immediate delivery. Next-day delivery still rose slightly, rising to over 2,150,000. As a result, it closed down 23,000 from the previous day. Ornamental gold fell to 228,000. Refined silver and silver dollars were stable. The dark rate of interbank lending was still tight, ranging from 13 to 16 cents. In the afternoon, it rose to 18 cents.

Foreign currencies also changed little. Under the supply of foreign bank recycling goods, coupled with speculation that the circulation of US dollars was prohibited, new purchases were restrained. From the high price of 4,000 yuan in the early morning, it gradually fell. Although there were minor setbacks in the middle, it did not help. At noon, it finally broke through the 3,900 yuan mark. In the afternoon, immediate delivery fell slightly again. Later, the gold price opened for next-day delivery and rose slightly together. Finally, it struggled around 3,900 yuan. As a result, it closed down 80 yuan from the previous day. The price difference with gold widened slightly to 550 yuan per ten taels. Hong Kong banknotes were stable, with a small increase of 5 yuan. The Hong Kong exchange rate was still above 820 yuan due to the telegram from Hong Kong. The Indian exchange rate was selling for 1,000 yuan. The British exchange rate rose to 13,400 yuan. The US exchange rate was still not being traded.

### Bond Market Weak

Since the bulls in the bond market had made some gains, buying sentiment turned quiet. In addition, the financial sector provided some supply, so it fell. Tongbing opened slightly lower at 2,070 yuan in the morning. This price continued to be surrounded by sellers and fell continuously. At noon, it was unable to recover and fell into the 1,900 yuan range. As a result, it closed down 180 yuan from the previous day. Jiayi, Yiyi and Wuwu each fell by 100 yuan. Tongding also fell by 70 yuan. The transaction volume was approximately 5 million yuan in par value.

### Foreign Stocks Also Correct Slightly

Foreign stocks were corrected slightly as securities firms closed positions. Yisha opened at 10,200 yuan and fell to 9,600 yuan. The rest were also dragged down. Yinglian was more stable and fell very little. As a result, Yinglian, Ye Guangwei, Hede Fengzhi, Yipi, Airlines and Steel fell by a little more than half a percent. Yisha fell by slightly less than 10%.

### Foreign Tea Firms Active, Baochang Reopens

The foreign tea market is gradually strengthening. Overseas demand is still good, and the market is very strong. Some varieties have even made further progress. It is also known that the British firm Baochang, which has reorganized its forces, heard that the foreign manager and tea master had flown from England to Shanghai at 4:00 pm the day before yesterday, and may join the activities next week. As for the domestic sales of red and green tea, the shops and banks in this street and the Su-Xi area are still following one after another. At the same time, the Tianjin Gang, which had been stagnant for a long time, has also been revived, but the actual demand is very narrow, and the buying sentiment is fleeting.

### Sugar Price Remains Unchanged

The Sugar Price Review Committee of the Social Affairs Bureau held the 16th Sugar Price Review Committee yesterday. It is reported that the review result is that the 16th sugar price will remain the same as the 15th period price. The calculated price is 130,000 yuan per dan for granulated sugar and 110,000 yuan per dan for raw sugar.

### Impact of US Seamen's Strike, Foreign Exchange Approval for Orders to be Postponed, Exchange Settlement Period for Machinery Imports Also Adjusted

The recent strike by US seamen has made it impossible for Shanghai importers to receive US goods on schedule. The foreign exchange letters of credit for which they have applied for approval must be extended. The Foreign Exchange Review Office of the Central Bank has agreed to the extension. The bank issued Special Circular No. 53 to designated banks yesterday, stating: "The recent strike by US seamen will inevitably delay freight. The letters of credit and entrustment purchase certificates opened by various designated banks for merchants to order goods from the United States before September 5, 1946, have not yet expired, or those opened after this date, the banks, after verifying the facts, may extend them themselves without applying for approval from this bank. The extension period shall be from the expiration date of the letter of credit and entrustment purchase certificate to the date of resumption of work by the seamen, plus one month. However, letters of credit and entrustment purchase certificates that expired before September 5, 1946, shall not be extended without the approval of this bank."

Currently, the Central Bank originally stipulated that the foreign exchange for which exchange settlement has been approved must be used to ship the goods purchased from abroad to Shanghai within three months. If the deadline is exceeded, it will become invalid. However, the shipping schedule for foreign machinery and production tools often exceeds three months, and some are even delayed for up to one year. This regulation is tantamount to prohibiting the import of foreign machinery, and the domestic machinery production industry has been severely damaged. The Ministry of Economic Affairs, in view of this, has agreed with the Central Bank to remedy the situation. The effective period of exchange settlement for the purchase of machinery imports from the Central Bank will be adjusted so that the import of production tools will not be restricted by time and suffer losses. This measure will greatly benefit the reconstruction of China's machinery industry.

### Rayon Skyrockets and Plummets, Yesterday Up 400,000 Again, Japanese Goods Arrive, CITIC to Distribute Soon

Rayon rebounded yesterday, with the first call at 120 Tianqiao Youguang at a minimum of 4.1 million yuan. Later, due to lack of supply, there was a market but no goods, and the price was raised again to 800,000 yuan. The maximum called was over 900,000 yuan. It was slightly smaller in the afternoon, trading at 700,000 yuan, 400,000 yuan higher than the previous day. The most stagnant Yi cargo 120 Guang in the market was traded at 3.9 million yuan yesterday.

CITIC Distribution Limited to Manufacturers

The rayon ordered by the Central Trust Bureau from Japan has indeed arrived here. The bureau sent personnel to pick up the goods yesterday (2nd) and will begin distribution soon. The distribution method is being drafted. According to Wang Zijian, director of the Committee for the Sale of Government Materials and Property, who is acting as an agent for the bureau, the distribution of this batch of rayon to Shanghai still needs to be discussed with the Textile Construction Company. The principle is to directly supply the manufacturers to avoid it falling into the hands of merchants and becoming a tool for speculation and hoarding. According to the barter agreement, MacArthur's headquarters will still supply rayon on a monthly basis next year, which can be continuously transported. There will be no problem with the supply of rayon to the market.

Association Investigation Actual Conditions of Each Factory

After the Japanese rayon arrived, the Central Trust Bureau yesterday summoned the persons in charge of the Electrical Silk Weaving Factory Industry Association to inquire about the actual conditions of each factory as a basis for allocation. Therefore, the directors and supervisors of the industry have decided to go to each factory today to conduct on-site investigations, record the current production situation and the actual quantity of rayon required in a systematic manner, and report it to the Central Trust Bureau. It is reported that the distribution will be accurately allocated according to the actual needs to eliminate the black market.

Textile Construction Company Sells Surplus Enemy Property

In order to suppress the rise in rayon prices, the Textile Manufacturing Company negotiated with the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau of Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui to allocate a portion of the enemy property rayon and decided to sell it to the market publicly today (3rd). Each silk factory that has completed the registration procedures can be allocated about one box per unit, and the sale will continue thereafter.

### Rise Reaches Saturation Point, Yarn and Cloth Enter Stagnant State, High Prices Difficult to Sell, Interbank Market Too Tight, North Road Merchants Turn to Changshu and Wuxi for Procurement

[Reported by this newspaper] The Yarn Factory Joint Distribution Committee held its regular meeting yesterday. As a result of the discussion, the standard amount of 20-count cotton yarn to be sold was 1869.5 pieces for private factories and 1178.5 pieces for Textile Construction. The selling price is still 1.55 million yuan per piece, based on 400 pounds of 20-count yarn as the standard.

The yarn market fell sharply yesterday. The reason is that the merchants' stomachs have reached saturation and they have not added any more. In addition, colleagues are forced to seek cash due to the interbank market, and they have sold their goods one after another. After the initial transaction of five pieces of Double Horse at 2.26 million in the morning, sellers came one after another, and it fell sharply. The final closing price was 2.15 million. The other 20-count and 16-count also fell by 100,000 to 160,000. The decline of 42-count was even more severe, about 300,000 less than the previous day.

The reason is that the price is too high, and sales have stopped. The price is also too high for over-the-counter sales in this street, and procurement is very rare. Under this state, all colleagues are in a tight interbank market and are eager to sell their goods. Subsequently, the Guangdong Gang absorbed a small amount at a low price, and the market for fine-count yarn and thread rebounded slightly.

The cloth market also gradually became stagnant yesterday. Four Gentlemen poplin was 96,000 yuan. Jumping Carp poplin was 2,000 yuan higher than the price quoted by Textile Construction, at 90,000 yuan. Caiqiu fine cloth was 86,000 to 7,000 yuan, which has also declined. Since the adjustment of the exchange rate, the price of cloth has been rising. Although the Textile Construction authorities have tried their best to suppress it at the original price, it is still useless. The continuous surge in prices in recent weeks is due to the imbalance between supply and demand. Now that the rising momentum has reached the saturation point, its reaction is also a natural reason. In addition, the interbank market is very tight, and some merchants from North Road are stationed in Changshu, Wuxi and other production areas to procure, so the dark interest rate in these two places is as high as 27%. Moreover, the Central Trust Bureau is also tendering for a large number of yarn and cloth, which makes people even more nervous. However, according to well-informed sources, the base price of the Central Trust Bureau's tender is very high. For example, the base price of Four Gentlemen old goods poplin is 92,500 yuan. The market price yesterday was about 97,000 yuan. Therefore, the tender price of the undertaker must be higher than its base price. Therefore, although the market is weak, it does not seem to be in danger of collapsing.

Mr. Liu Wenteng, Director of the Business Department of the Textile Industry Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, recently returned to Shanghai after being promoted to Beijing on official business. He told reporters that he had contacted the Executive Yuan regarding the method of transporting yarn and cloth to the south and requested that a supplementary instruction be given to the Customs Administration so that the method could be implemented on the day the Executive Yuan's order arrived. In addition, although he had requested instructions on the method of expanding the yarn and cloth distribution organization, he had not yet obtained any specific clues.

### Tight Interbank Market, Chinese Stocks Fall, Only Central Silk Announces Increase

Chinese stocks began to fall yesterday. The interbank market was tight, and the fire was unfavorable. It was difficult to advance further. People in the securities industry and miscellaneous capital all cut their positions and sold them. Although the wealthy households entered, they were not many. The banks also provided a small amount of supply, so the overall situation was repeatedly timid and unable to recover. When the market opened in the morning, all stocks except Jingfu (hot stocks opened with Jingfu first) had already fallen slightly. Even if there was a rebound after the opening, they all failed to exceed the previous closing price. The feet were therefore weak. Subsequently, under the more common cutting of long positions, they gradually fell. However, there were frequent struggles in the middle. Ultimately, the interbank market became tighter, and many parties in the material sector closed their positions. Banks also sold slightly, and the shorts began to take action. After the low point near noon, there was a rebound after covering short positions, but because of the suppression of physical goods, it was not firm at the close.

The rice market registered more than 15,000 stones of cargo yesterday. The Social Affairs Bureau also sold 200 bags of Taiwanese rice, but because the stores were still wealthy and the production areas were firm and expensive, the price of indica rice continued to rise by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Newly harvested glutinous rice had few arrivals and sales, and the market was stable. A small amount of newly harvested early rice (the so-called kiln seed Bagger rice) has arrived in Shanghai, but there is no surge. Baiyuanjiu was tired for a long time. Today, because of the movement of zero sales, it rebounded by 1,000 yuan. The interior reported an increase in wheat prices. Arrivals and inventory were scarce.

Bran continues to be popular in rural areas, rising by another 100 to 200 yuan. Raw oil was firm in the morning and weak in the afternoon, and the price rose by more than 2,000 yuan.

### Handkerchief Industry Agrees on New Prices

### CITIC Does Not Intend to Raise Purchase Price of Raw Silk

The Central Trust Bureau was ordered to purchase raw silk. So far, only two batches have been received, totaling more than 2,600 dans. The third batch is being reviewed by the China Silkworm Company. In the midst of rising silk prices, some manufacturers are waiting and hoping that the Central Trust Bureau will raise the purchase price. According to the person in charge of the Central Trust Bureau, the recent increase in silk prices was driven by rayon and is only a temporary phenomenon. It will return to its original state in the short term. The purchase price this time was carefully considered by the government, and merchants will definitely not suffer losses. Moreover, the silk price above grade D will be determined by the Purchase and Sales Committee again, and there is room for flexibility. I hope that all manufacturers will appreciate the government's hard work and not be extravagant. The government-set price is already a big loss compared to foreign market prices. It is impossible to ask for a further increase. Therefore, the purchase method will not be changed. In addition, the Central Bank has notified the Central Trust Bureau, the China Silkworm Company, and the Commodity Testing Bureau to designate representatives for the Raw Silk Purchase and Sales Committee so that it can be established.

### Intense Competition, Shortage of Funds, Department Store Industry Not Easy to Develop

[Reported by this newspaper] Recently, a person in the department store industry told reporters that the industry's main business is retail and the sale of cotton, silk, woolen fabrics, cosmetics, enamel, rubber, etc. There are about 900 colleagues in the industry. Therefore, business competition is quite fierce. Currently, the only things that the industry can rely on to make profits are fancy goods and various rare luxury goods. Ordinary general-purpose goods, such as cotton fabrics, have recently seen a gradual increase in factory prices. However, due to competition, the retail price in stores has never been able to increase. It is reported that the recent retail sales in the industry have not improved due to the general reduction in the purchasing power of citizens. On average, only 20% of gross profit can be earned per month. The working capital is short. For example, winter goods must be fully prepared in the autumn, so they have to borrow funds from various banks. The interest owed this month alone is as high as 15%, so they really cannot bear the pressure of high-interest loans. In addition, heavy donations and taxes and the proliferation of private goods are also obstacles to the future development of the industry.

### Summary of Market Conditions

Timber: The market is brisk. Fir timber is still favored by buyers, and there are people searching for it. The market atmosphere for foreign pine is also good.

Tin Foil: The market is declining. Although existing inventory has a one-month deadline to be sold, with a tax to be paid if it is overdue, it remains to be seen whether convenient (tax-free) export will be possible within this deadline. If taxes are required, the prospects will remain weak.

Hardware: Prices are gradually stabilizing, and the absorption capacity of out-of-town merchants is also weakening. Local sales in this city are still good.

Woolen Fabrics: Autumn sales are underway. Transactions of woolen fabrics, whether in large or small quantities, retail or wholesale, are all flourishing. Out-of-town merchants also continue to increase their purchases, especially those from Nanjing, who are most diligent in purchasing. However, they are all limited to fine wool goods and overcoat fabrics.

Sichuan Pickled Mustard Tuber: Although the peak season for sales has passed, the amount in stock is not much, especially for high-quality goods. Top-grade [Sichuan pickled mustard tuber] from well known producers must be sold for 140,000 to 150,000 yuan, while inferior ones are less than 100,000 yuan.

### Academic Credentials of Middle School Students from the Nine Northeastern Provinces: Ministry of Education to Adjust According to the Current Academic System

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] The middle schools in the Nine Northeastern Provinces during the puppet Manchukuo period followed a four-year academic system. The academic credentials of middle school students who graduated after four years are not in accordance with the current system. The Ministry of Education has recently adjusted these academic credentials. For this year's graduates who have completed four years of study, the standard will be equivalent to the qualifications for the first year of senior high school. If they continue their studies, they can enter the second year of senior high school. Those who have completed three years of study are equivalent to junior high school graduates. The rest can be inferred by analogy. Now that the Nine Northeastern Provinces have been changed to a six-year secondary school system in accordance with the Ministry's order, all institutions will follow this method to verify the academic qualifications of students from middle schools established during the puppet Manchukuo regime.

### Ma Xiangbo's Donation of Aurora University School Land During His Lifetime: Court Declares Confirmation of Ownership

Aurora University has 3,000 mu of school land in Songjiang and Qingpu counties, which was donated by Mr. Ma Xiangbo to the Catholic Church 47 years ago as an educational fund. At that time, Aurora University had not yet been established. Aurora University has accepted it from the Catholic Church for more than 40 years without incident. However, after Mr. Ma passed away, Ma Qiu Renwo, who claimed to be Ma's daughter-in-law, and her daughter Yu Zhang, relying on special forces, seized more than 7,000 shi of rent rice over the years.

On September 23, the Songjiang Court declared a verdict confirming the ownership of Aurora University, and Ma Qiu Renwo lost the lawsuit. All losses incurred by Aurora, involving civil and criminal matters, will be pursued separately in accordance with the law.

Civil Administration Briefs

### Ministry of Interior Explains Electoral Doubts Regarding Municipal Assembly Members: Municipal Government Has Issued Orders for Notification

The Municipal Government approved the telegram from the Ministry of Interior, which submitted instructions from the Executive Yuan, explaining two items of electoral doubts regarding municipal assembly members as follows: "(1) As farmers' associations, labor unions, fishermen's associations, education associations, and free professional organizations all have employees as members, when electing municipal assembly members, the number of seats allocated should be calculated based on the number of members actually participating in the selection of professional organizations. As for members of chambers of commerce, as the Chamber of Commerce Law clearly defines them as companies and firms, the number of seats should be calculated based on the number of companies and firms. Whether this calculation standard is fair is a legislative issue and cannot be changed by interpretation. (2) If the regulations for the election of county and municipal assembly members are completely the same, then their interpretations can be mutually applied." Please check and notify the departments under your jurisdiction.

### The Layers Beneath Hong Kong's Prosperity

— Special Correspondent Ling Fang, Hong Kong Airmail Dispatch, 30th of this Month

"…On the surface, Hong Kong has recovered quickly, but Hong Kong's trade is mutually dependent on Chinese commerce; Hong Kong itself only accounts for one aspect. Hong Kong's complete restoration to its pre-war status as a major world trading port still awaits the improvement of the situation in China." —"Standard Chartered Bank Annual Report."

Another year has passed since the British troops re-entered Hong Kong.

In the past year, Hong Kong has transitioned from military administration to civil administration, from the recovery phase to the construction phase. Although there are still some areas that are "not as ideal," order has replaced chaos, society has stabilized, and all industries are gradually recovering, strengthening people's confidence in the future. This was something no one could have predicted a year ago. Recently, many people from mainland China have traveled all the way to Hong Kong for sightseeing. From as far as Beijing, Shanghai, and Wuhan (including a Wuhan reporter group) to as near as Guangdong and Guangxi (including a Guangzhou reporter group), they have set foot on the island, heard and seen things firsthand, with more praise than criticism. The British are indeed seasoned veterans in ruling colonies. It is just a pity that after two world wars, the blood and sweat of millions of people cannot wash away their outdated thinking. Hong Kong, this little bird, remains a milestone marking the stain on Sino-British relations over the past century, rather than serving as the cornerstone for mutual understanding and sincere co-existence between the two great nations. This is something we lament.

Measures of the Military Government

In the past twelve months, Hong Kong experienced eight months of military administration. The British took advantage of this transitional period to clear away the remnants left by the Japanese. During the military administration, "all powers and responsibilities, including judicial, legislative, and administrative powers, and jurisdiction over the property of all people in Hong Kong, were the responsibility of Major General Ha Han, Commander-in-Chief of the British Army, Navy, and Air Force in Hong Kong." This placed Hong Kong's complex political affairs under the direct control of the military government. The military government brought in a large number of experts, some of whom had been planning the future return to Hong Kong since the fall of Hong Kong. Based on the plan approved by the British Colonial Office, they engaged in reconstruction work, utilizing the supreme power of the military government.

When the Union Jack was hoisted over Hong Kong Island again, the military government issued a decree controlling food and fuel. Following this, a large number of relief ships brought in grain, resolving the food problem. Not only was it resolved, but the "one yuan for five catties" of white rice also attracted countless people from mainland China to Hong Kong, supporting the market and serving as a powerful factor for future prosperity. The supply of water and electricity was also restored in the shortest possible time. During this period, the military government strived to preserve the vitality of the local community. Although possessing unlimited power, it never took excessive actions that would provoke popular resentment. For example, prostitution was banned before the war, but during the military administration, public brothels were established. Before the war, small food vendors had to obtain business licenses, but during the military administration, people were free to set up stalls. Before the war, bicycles and pedicabs were not allowed to carry passengers, but during the military administration, bicycles and pedicabs often served as public buses, carrying passengers back and forth (these phenomena were gradually prohibited after the restoration of civil administration). The military government's measures were mostly focused on basic tasks: (1) conducting birth and death registrations (to count the population); (2) establishing tenancy tribunals (to settle residents); (3) cracking down on exchange shops and silver houses that were not registered before the war (to stabilize finance); (4) requiring schools, organizations, and newspapers to register their radio receivers; (5) enforcing immigration restrictions on those who were not of Chinese nationality (to maintain public order); (6) restoring transportation (to facilitate people's livelihood), … Among these, the restoration of transportation was the most effective.

On the eve of the Japanese surrender, Hong Kong's harbor and its surroundings were filled with mines, and there were many floating mines in the Pearl River estuary. In fact, surface traffic between Hong Kong and Guangzhou and Macau had ceased. At that time, only a few motorized junks risked sailing, and travelers regarded it as a dangerous journey. After the tragedy of the Haizhu Steamer sinking outside Humen after striking a mine, drowning more than a dozen people, people turned pale at the mention of floating mines at sea. On the land, the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway was fully repaired and open to traffic by mid-November, while the British naval mine-sweeping team had not yet completed its work. At the beginning of this year, the British Navy also cleared the mines in the Pearl River Estuary for us, and Hong Kong's traffic to the inland rivers of Guangdong Province was able to proceed unimpeded.

Regarding traffic between Hong Kong and Kowloon, the military government took over the ferry company and the bus company, using the remaining ships and vehicles to maintain transportation in various places, which was quite effective. With the exception of doubling the bus fares, the ferry fares were still charged at pre-war rates. These two measures, along with food control, can be considered the most effective measures taken by the British.

On May 1st, Hong Kong officially restored civil administration. If the military government's measures sought stability amidst chaos, then the civil administration's measures sought progress from stability. Therefore, the "tolerance" of the military administration no longer existed at this time. After Governor Yang Muqi was sworn in, he appointed members of the Executive Council and the Legislative Council, restoring the Executive Council and Legislative Council. The foundation of "the rule of law" was re-established. Experts sent by London, including political and technical experts, arrived in Hong Kong in succession. Almost every one of them represented every pre-war problem in Hong Kong. They organized all kinds of committees, such as the Reconstruction Planning Committee, the Housing Construction Committee, the Port Expansion Committee, the Committee for Studying Tenancy Legislation, the Labor Arbitration Committee, and even the Car Left-Hand Drive Research Committee.… They all meticulously reviewed problems, specifically proposed solutions, and acted once decisions were made, never engaging in empty talk on paper, deceiving themselves and others, or perfunctorily fulfilling their responsibilities. This was completely different from the style of bureaucratic politics. Because the rule of law was restored, laws passed before the war have been successively restored to enforcement. In order to adjust industrial and commercial supply and promote economic prosperity, the Hong Kong government issued the "1946 Price Control Ordinance" following the Grain Control Ordinance, and soon also issued laws such as regulations on the use of materials (including buildings, airplanes, and vehicles), import licenses, and the control of textiles? … (see the article "Hong Kong Industrial Leaps" on August 9th), planning to control the entire market and forcing merchants to turn from the road of speculation back to normal business. "Trade figures have increased substantially, symbolizing a bright future for Hong Kong, and residents can fully rely on stable and valuable currency." – Report by Morse, General Manager of HSBC, July 12th.

The stability of Hong Kong's currency is indeed one of the main conditions for promoting Hong Kong's prosperity. The Hong Kong government set an exchange rate (one Hong Kong dollar is worth one shilling, two pence, and one-quarter of a British pound), making Hong Kong dollars directly linked to British pounds, not only avoiding the impact of fluctuations in Chinese legal tender, but also absorbing large amounts of funds from wealthy Chinese people as new blood for the construction of Hong Kong. The emerging capital of China after the war, just like the wealth of warlords and landlords in the past, built Western-style houses or large factories in the valleys or seashores of Hong Kong and Kowloon.

In past dispatches, the reporter has pointed out the benefits of low wages in Hong Kong to Hong Kong's industrial recovery. The Hong Kong government spared no effort to prevent price increases from stimulating wage increases, and consulted with the management to set a fixed wage, which major factories uniformly complied with. Since the restoration of civil administration, labor strikes in Hong Kong have occurred repeatedly, especially the two strikes at the Hong Kong Electric Company and the cross-harbor ferry company, which were the most serious. However, the workers were also unable to fully achieve their demands. Therefore, Hong Kong's factories have resumed work one after another, and there is talk of Shanghai factories relocating to Hong Kong (117 Shanghai foreign-owned factories have registered in Hong Kong after the war). Speaking of this, let us look back at the work of our country's agencies stationed in Hong Kong in the past year. Let us start with the reception aspect: we must not forget that Major General Ha Han led the British fleet back into Hong Kong to accept the surrender of the local Japanese army on the orders of the Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese War Zone, and our military delegation also entered Hong Kong with the British fleet. What we received, in addition to the remaining weapons of the Japanese army and dozens of broken ships in Hong Kong, was nothing else. It cannot be compared with the "reception" in Beijing and Shanghai, but the things left by the Japanese were not few. Not to mention anything else, the Osaka Pier on the Central Waterfront has now become the "Standard Chartered Pier." The head of the military delegation stationed in Hong Kong has been changed three times, and the difficulty of the reception work can be imagined.

In the early days of the British army's re-entry into Hong Kong, its strength was weak, and it requested our assistance in maintaining order. Our military police force stepped on the former territory that had been lost a century ago after the Japanese surrender. Later, the Southwest National Army was ordered to be transferred north in large numbers, passing through Hong Kong and renting private houses in the northern district of Kowloon Tong as temporary barracks. Overseas Chinese witnessed the majestic posture of fully armed National Army troops day and night (before the war, the Hong Kong government had long prohibited armed National Army troops from entering the country), and were very excited. On August 15th, the National Army troops stationed in the Kowloon Tong barracks were ordered to return to Shenzhen, and our military delegation stationed in Hong Kong, the Guangzhou General Headquarters Office in Hong Kong, and other agencies were also announced to be closed. The sudden departure of the National Army from Hong Kong caused much speculation. Some said that the Hong Kong government, in view of the great internal strife in China, and in order to maintain absolute neutrality, did not want to provide the National Army with the convenience of passing through the country. According to reliable sources, the passage of the National Army through Hong Kong was based on an agreement signed with the British in advance, stipulating that it would expire on August 15th of this year, and the National Army returned to the country after the expiration date in order to abide by its promise. Our government allocated 40 million yuan in national currency to Hong Kong to handle education and relief work for the overseas Chinese who had been under the iron heel of the Japanese for three years and eight months. It also registered the wartime losses of overseas Chinese (including military notes) and sought compensation from the Japanese on their behalf. Recently, it also organized US dollar loans to assist in the industrial recovery of overseas Chinese. The Hong Kong Office of the Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Guangdong and Guangxi was officially established last December, which is a small compensation for the protection of the interests of overseas Chinese, but it still seems necessary to strengthen its work.

During this year, at least two unpleasant incidents occurred between our agencies stationed in Hong Kong and the Hong Kong government, which caused considerable tension: one was the case of Second Lieutenant Rong of the National Army being insulted by Bu Bian, and the other was the incident of the closure of the National Daily, especially the latter which stirred up the whole maple leaf. The newspaper has already reported in detail on this incident, so I will not repeat it here. The case of the real traitor is also a pending case that has been repeatedly negotiated between China and the United Kingdom without a proper outcome. The Hong Kong issue after the war has become a decisive factor in Sino-British relations, and I hope that everyone will unite to support the government so that it can obtain the most reasonable solution.

Now, except for the "Deferred Payment Ordinance," also known as the "Suspension Bill," which has not yet been revoked, Hong Kong can be said to have returned to normal in general after a year of recovery efforts. The pre-war funds frozen by the Deferred Payment Act alone amount to more than 50 million yuan at HSBC. In order to control floating capital, the Hong Kong government has been reluctant to revoke this decree for a long time. This has a considerable impact on the flow of funds, trade development, and industrial prosperity in Hong Kong and China. However, because the relationship between wartime debts and bonds has not been properly resolved, the decree cannot be revoked early. Since the decree has not been revoked, the shares of major Chinese and Western companies in Hong Kong cannot be formally publicly traded. The total value of the shares of major companies before the war was 981,272,471 yuan. According to general estimates, it should now rise to more than 150 billion yuan. Morse, General Manager of HSBC, has called for the revocation of the Deferred Payment Ordinance, and members of the Legislative Council have also discussed it. At the end of August, the Hong Kong government had accepted the proposal passed by the Legislative Council to revoke the bill, which still needs to be approved by the British government before it can be announced, but it is feared that the period will not be far off.

At the beginning of his tenure, the Governor of Hong Kong announced that the Hong Kong government's budget expenditure for the next eleven months would be 75 million yuan, while tax revenue would be less than 40 million yuan. In order to make up for the shortfall, the Hong Kong government considered levying a war tax. In mid-July, the Financial Secretary proposed the fiscal budget for 1946 (ending March 31, 1947), totaling 160,151,665 yuan, which means that the entire population of Hong Kong, which is 1.2 million people, will bear an average of more than 120 yuan per person. It is rumored that the Hong Kong government will continue to levy four types of war taxes from October, including income tax and excessive profit tax, on the grounds that the Pacific Treaty has not yet been signed. If this is true, it remains to be seen whether residents can "afford it" at that time, and the extent of Hong Kong's prosperity can be observed.

### Visiting Major Traitors in Prison

— Yang Yanbing, Nanjing Dispatch, September 30

Zhou Fohai said: "Writing autobiographies, reading novels, prison life is nothing."

Ding Mocun said: "They escorted us to the east, then to the west. What's there to talk about preferential treatment!"

Last August, after Japan announced its unconditional surrender, a group of senior officials of the puppet National Government were panicked and at a loss, not knowing what method to use to cope with this sudden change. As a result, before the receiving officials arrived, the demons all ran east and west. Only Zhou Fohai, Ding Mocun, and others actually received appointments from the Central Government, ordering Zhou Fohai to be the commander of the Shanghai Action Team of the Military Commission, and Ren Yuandao to be the commander-in-chief of the vanguard army. At the time, many people said that this was a miracle. Subsequently, the work of capturing traitors was actively carried out, and big and small traitors were arrested one after another. Only Zhou and others were escorted to Chongqing. A year later, they were escorted to Nanjing by special plane on the 16th of this month. In the minds of many people, this is another strange celebration.

At 3:00 PM on the 23rd, five "traitor nobles," including Zhou Fohai, Ding Mocun, Luo Junqiang, Ma Jiliang, and Yang Xinghua, were transferred from No. 19 Ninghai Road to the Capital Land Court Detention Center at Lao Chu Bridge. Because of certain relationships, the reporter was allowed to visit the prison for the second time.

They were held in several different numbered prison cells. Zhou, Ding, and Luo were in Zhongzi No. 4, Ma was in No. 3, and Yang was in No. 6. The air and light were adequate. There were also two young servants who were in charge of sweeping and serving during the day, so it was quite tidy. However, the caretakers, cooks, and servants they brought were all left behind, and they could not enjoy special treatment alone, but the national law was still lenient to them after all.

When the reporter arrived at the entrance of the prison cell, Zhou was sitting on the bed, with a rosy complexion, but his spirit was slightly weak. He looked up and saw the reporter, and he actually stood up. The reporter then asked Zhou if he was used to the prison life. He said it was nothing, writing autobiographies, reading novels, and the day passed quickly. Then the reporter asked again:

"Was General Dai Li's death a loss to you?"

Zhou replied silently: "I had a relationship with the Central Government since January of the 32nd year to cover underground work comrades, and to maintain the security of the Jiangnan area after the victory. Only General Dai was the clearest about the Shanghai affairs…"

"Then what about before the 32nd year?" The reporter impatiently interrupted Zhou's words, but he was silent.

Ma and Luo were talking. When they saw the reporter standing at the door, they also stopped talking. Ma turned his head away, seemingly unwilling to let the reporter see his face. Ding took the initiative to come over and join the conversation.

Talking about life in Chongqing, Ding said: "Some people think that our escort to Chongqing was special treatment, otherwise why not escort others? You want to escort us to the east and seal us to the west. Life is so unfree. What's there to talk about preferential treatment!"

"This morning, the High Court summoned you again, right?"

"It's been several times." Zhou said, "Everything about the past is written in the autobiography. Right and wrong, merits and demerits, will be judged fairly." Seeing their kind of peace of mind, and Chen Gongbo not realizing his mistakes until death, can really be regarded as "different tunes played with the same skill."

Because it was the time after lunch when they could move around freely for a while, Lin Baisheng also came out of the Zhongzi House. Lin and Zhou had always been incompatible, so when he saw Zhou today, he retreated. Zhou also said with a disgusted tone: "This strange thing always howls and cries every night, making it impossible for us to sleep. I don't know what he's doing."

"I heard that the court has already sentenced him to death, so he's probably afraid of death!" The reporter inadvertently gave Zhou a strong stimulus. There was a lot of meaning implied, and Zhou was silent. The reporter also hurriedly retreated.

The reporter thought to himself: The life and death of Zhou and others are in the hands of the highest authorities. Even if he had a relationship with the Central Government since January of the 32nd year, covering underground work comrades, and maintaining the security of Jiangnan after the victory, so that the National Army could take over smoothly, he still cannot offset the monstrous crime of treason! What the Chinese people are watching is naturally the handling of them by the traitor trial authorities.

### Photo by Our Special Correspondent Zhang Liumei: Xianghe City, That Shocked the World

Readers should still be able to recall the scene of the Communist army entering Xianghe City when the July 29th Incident occurred. The pictures published here will be used to replace written accusations: (1) During the eight years of the War of Resistance and the current turmoil, although the high walls of Xianghe City still stand here, they are covered with terrible wounds, collapse, and dilapidation, just like the suffering people, and are unbearable to look at. (2) A house at Anping Station on the Pingjin Highway was severely damaged. This is also the trace of the damage caused by the shells during the July 29th Incident. (3) After the Communist army entered Xianghe City, they demolished the city wall and dug a large number of trenches on it. (4) This is the main street of Xianghe, quiet and eerie. If it weren't for the investigation team here, it is likely that a shell would blossom inside.

### Cholera Spreads a Black Net in Guilin

— Special Correspondent Liang Xiaozhong, Guilin Airmail Dispatch, 11th of this Month

The new grain is hitting the market like a tide, and rice prices are falling tragically, 70,000, 60,000, 40,000, 30,000, 27,000 per dan. The fall in rice prices is lively, and the salary increase for public school teachers is also lively. An average month's salary can buy 500 to 1,000 catties of white rice, which is really affordable. However, provincial-level civil servants may not be able to get their wish, and the provincial government keeps saying "financial deficit," and it looks like it will be discounted again by 30 to 20 percent. Moreover, while rice is cheap, other things have not bowed their heads. The price of one catty of pork is ten times that of one catty of rice, and this can be inferred to other things.

Cholera spread a black net in Guilin, with as many as a thousand patients in half a month. The pitifully poor hospital dared not confirm that it was cholera because it lacked testing equipment and called it "similar to cholera," and this "similar cholera" has made the coffin shop owner laugh so hard that he can't open his eyes to this day. Many people who died from "similar cholera" were wrapped in a mat "similar to a coffin" and carried out to the suburbs because they had no coffin. The hospital's emergency treatment became a mere formality. Due to the lack of medicine, six out of ten patients who entered the hospital would never come out again. Even the hospital's refusal to accept patients became a common occurrence. After a scolding in the newspaper, the next day there would be a "letter of correction" (one person had already died after one correction). This is the doctor's morality.

There is news that is even more shocking than cholera. It turns out that the Communist Party has taken a fancy to the Yao Mountain area bordering Lingchuan, Xiuren, and other counties, and is transporting batches of military supplies into it, preparing to act when the time is right. Unfortunately, the plan was not secret, but a full house was raided in Lingchuan County. Speaking of which, I feel a little disappointed for the Communist Party. I dare to say one thing: the Communist Party is definitely not "doing nothing" in Guangxi, especially the tail that is waving the flag and shouting, which can be said to be renewing itself day by day. I don't know how to write a neutral statement, but I believe that the love and hatred of the public is also my personal love and hatred. If I were to say something more objectively, I would tell you: "No one in Guangxi does not hate the Communist Party."

Commissioner Ni Zhongtao, who was good at killing county magistrates, was tried in public. He had been running around beforehand, and defended himself eloquently during the defense. Finally, with the strong support of Fang Yuan, he was lightly sentenced to eleven years in prison. Eleven years is not a long time, and Commissioner Ni is waiting for a general amnesty, or a "small amnesty."

### Examination of Maps

— A Word of Caution

Chinese education does not pay much attention to geography. For example, the so-called main courses in schools are Chinese, arithmetic, and English. As for geography and history, it does not hinder promotion if you fail. Therefore, the concept of the nation's territory is very weak in the minds of Chinese youth. In the past, the enemy took our Northeast and even North China, and we southerners did not feel it seriously, and we simply did not know the importance of these places in geography. We are too negligent in our knowledge of geography.

Let's look at how much the Japanese valued the study of geography in the past. It is said that in Japan, you can find a bookstore that specializes in selling Chinese maps. During the occupation of Beijing and Shanghai, the first thing the enemy did in education was to replace geography textbooks and confiscate maps from bookstores and libraries. Under this painful contrast, we ourselves feel ashamed even though we have won.

Recently, it was reported that the "World New Situation Map" published by the Shanghai World and Earth Society contains numerous errors, such as still recognizing Taiwan and Korea as Japanese territories, and mistakenly including important areas west of the Congling Mountains to the Jiangxinpo area within the borders of other countries. This absurdity has made the government unable to tolerate it. Isn't this absurd to the extreme? If you don't even have this basic knowledge, how can you be qualified to compile maps? This also shows how neglected our country has been in geography in the past.

The Ministry of Interior has re-amended the "Regulations on the Examination of Land and Sea Maps," stipulating that all maps must be examined and approved before they can be registered and issued. This is a passive measure. We propose that the National Compilation and Translation Bureau should jointly organize a Land and Sea Map Compilation Committee with the Ministry of National Defense and the Ministry of Interior, and hire well-known geography experts to compile the latest maps and geography textbooks, and that the education curriculum standards should stipulate that those who fail geography should not be promoted or graduated, so that the Chinese people can pay attention to the teaching of geography.

### A New Discussion of Democracy

— Hu Haoran

Published by the Da Dong Bookstore for Illiterate People in Jiangxi

Since the defeat of fascism in World War II, democratic politics, long scorned, have once again become fashionable. Both left and right wings are shouting about democracy at top volume. However, in the aftermath of the First World War, instead of the established democracies of Britain, the United States, and France, extreme nationalism in the form of Nazism or Fascism arose, along with Communism which promoted class struggle. The current international situation is even more precarious than at the end of the First World War. Even if the Nazis or Fascists do not make a comeback anytime soon, whether the democracy promoted by totalitarianism is truly more progressive than British democracy, and whether we should adopt it instead of the Anglo-American model, is a question worth examining. This book provides us with a very good source to investigate this issue.

The Spirit of Democracy

This book begins with "The Ethics of Democracy." Chapters one to three analyze concepts like freedom, equality, rights, and obligations, demonstrating that "democracy has, from the beginning, a moral content and a noble purpose." Chapter four emphasizes the importance of "cultivating political ethics," saying that "the fundamental problem in practicing democracy is how to make the replacement of administrative power follow established rules... To make politics sound, besides establishing institutions, it is especially necessary to strive to obtain capable people, and beyond that, to cultivate good political ethics." It then points out "public-mindedness," "fairness," "frankness," and "tolerance" as the main conditions for cultivating political ethics. Chapter five suggests that "the spirit of an ideal citizen is based on the development of a sense of public service." Recently, Ambassador Stuart said to reporters: "Democracy is the best system in the world, but if it is not responsible, it is also the worst system in the world." This is a warning to us to quickly cultivate a "sense of public service."

Next, "Looking at Democracy from Reality" is divided into five chapters. Chapter six discusses the difference between democratic countries and dictatorships, as well as the causes of dictatorial politics, and then proposes a suggestion for democratic countries to prevent dictatorial aggression: "Only by simultaneously increasing the government's authority to deal with economic crises, and appropriately limiting this authority, with both authority and responsibility having rational regulations, can politics be kept in balance forever." But how to increase the government's authority and how to add reasonable limitations to it? This is a major task of completely adjusting or reforming the entire structure of democratic countries, but it does not provide a concrete plan, leaving it to human wisdom to study. Originally, political systems often differ greatly due to different national conditions, and cannot be generalized. Dr. Sun Yat-sen, assessing the global situation and observing our historical and social background, advocated the "separation of power and ability," where the people have power and the government has ability, and proposed a Five-Power Constitution and a concrete plan for the National Assembly, which may be the greatest contribution of human wisdom and is worth considering.

Freedom of Speech

Chapter seven argues that freedom of speech is important to democracy, refuting the impropriety of those who oppose freedom of speech, and advocating giving freedom of speech to minorities. It says, "The life of a country's politics is largely entrusted to an excellent minority. Their politically heterodox behavior and unique opinions often become reflections of political measures. Maintaining political balance is definitely not about suppressing or suppressing minorities, but about tolerating or protecting minorities." This is not only a wake-up call for those in power in democratic countries, but also a motto for the general "sovereign people." Not only should maintaining political balance be done this way, but also to prevent the transfer of power from becoming a bloody revolution, it must be done this way. Only when minorities have real freedom of speech can minority parties hope to become majority parties; only then can the theory that political power changes according to public opinion be realized peacefully. Otherwise, under a democratic system where the minority obeys the majority, minority parties will never have the hope of becoming majority parties and will inevitably resort to armed revolution. Chapter eight discusses whether the "wartime parliamentary system" should be respected, and its conclusion is that it should be respected. Chapter nine discusses "the diplomacy of democratic countries," advocating breaking secret diplomacy and placing it under the supervision of political parties. From the perspective of democratic principles, these two points are natural. However, from experience, speed is of the essence in war, and the problem of people is always more important than the problem of law. If the right people are obtained, then it is good if the British Parliament establishes a National Expenditure Audit Committee during World War II to supervise the government's military actions. Just as during World War I, the British Parliament did not control the George Cabinet, and the US Congress did not control President Wilson, there was nothing major that occurred, and sometimes it was even felt that it was convenient to rush to war. As for the fact that diplomacy and military affairs are related, it also depends on who is speaking. In today's world where international wars cannot be eliminated, how easy is it to eliminate secret diplomacy; even Roosevelt, who advocated democracy the most, could not avoid falling into the old-fashioned diplomatic trap. The Three-Power Agreement on Chinese sovereignty reached at the Yalta Conference was not announced until half a year after the war, which is a clear example, and others are even less worthy of mention. We believe that to fully realize this ideal of open diplomacy, we must first find a way to realize world peace and abolish war.

Freedom from War

Chapter ten discusses "Democratic Ideals and Peace," explaining the importance of the relationship between democracy and peace, and then investigates the main reasons why international peace cannot be realized. It believes that (1) because under conditions of economic inequality, the attitudes between "haves" and "have-nots" are fundamentally different, and they have no common ideals, so they will not cooperate for peace. (2) Because the "individual liberalism" of democratic countries is applied to the international stage, they are unwilling to accept any restrictions on sovereignty. In this way, even if any international organization is temporarily established, it will ultimately be short-lived. This is indeed a famous saying that sees the crux of the problem. But we would also like to add one point: the concept of "checks and balances" in the democratic system should also be considered a factor in creating the current international situation. Because this concept originates from mutual suspicion and jealousy, and divides power to check each other; if there is a spirit of the rule of law domestically to maintain it, it can still be safe. When applied to the international arena, it evolves into a "balance of power" policy; without the spirit of the rule of law to maintain it, it relies entirely on the military and political balance of power to support it. Once the balance of power is broken, war will follow. The course of the First and Second World Wars can be used as an annotation. As for saying: "The failure of the international community is due to the lack of determination and courage of Britain and France, who reluctantly avoided war and did not hesitate to appease the aggressions of Germany, Japan, and Italy by kneeling and retreating," that is still a superficial view and does not conform to the facts. In fact, the British and French internally were first fighting for magic weapons and creating a balance of power. When the balance of power could not be maintained, retreat was not possible, and taking a tough attitude was also not necessarily effective. It must be understood that Westerners have always liked to show strength and act rashly and are unwilling to show weakness. Now the United States, learning from the previous mistakes of Britain and France being weak towards the Axis powers, has greatly changed its style and wants to use a strong policy to prevent Soviet expansion. But there are still people shouting loudly, saying that if things continue like this, they are afraid that it will lead to a third world war.

Freedom from Hunger

Next, "The Economic View of Democracy" is discussed. Some places have largely accepted the theories of the revisionist school of Marxism. Chapter eleven discusses the bourgeoisie and democracy; chapter twelve discusses freedom and the economic system, and after comparing capitalism and Marxism in detail, it determines that capitalism is not enough to guarantee the stability of the lives of the masses and allow democracy to flourish; but it is also definitely not something that can be achieved by using class struggle.

Speaking of this, I believe that the "liberal planned economy" that developed from this war and a kind of socialism that the British Labour Party cabinet is now promoting are indeed very worthy of our reference. Then Mr. Wang's saying that "democratic countries reluctantly implementing a planned economy are at least temporarily abandoning the spirit of responsible government" and "the tendency of dictatorial politics is to adopt socialist methods to open up the path to extreme authoritarianism" seems to be worrying about something that might not happen. However, this only seems easy to say in Britain and the United States, where democracy has deep roots. If it were in other countries, would the bourgeoisie be willing to easily give up the rights they have already obtained? I'm afraid it's a big question. The best thing is to follow Dr. Sun Yat-sen's "Principle of People's Livelihood," like our country, at a time when capitalism and socialism have not yet taken shape; while increasing production, we should prevent unequal distribution during the process of increasing production. I earnestly advise the ruling officials not to miss this opportunity. Chapter twelve explains the reasons why Marxism is still stimulating today, and makes deep and clear statements; it can make those who worship Marx deeply reflect.

### Reading "The Stream of Thought"

— Yang Tongfang

Book Title: On the Stream of Thought

Original Author: W. James

Translator: Tang Cheng

Publisher: Commercial Press

Publication Date: First edition in Chongqing, April 1945

"On the Stream of Thought" is a translation by the translator of Chapter 9, "The Stream of Thought," from W. James' "Principles of Psychology." James is a highly acclaimed psychologist in modern America, and his contribution to the psychology of emotion is significant. He initially studied medicine at Harvard University, later dedicating himself to the study of the relationship between the physiology of the nervous system and psychology, eventually becoming a philosopher and psychologist of Pragmatism.

Although James' "Principles of Psychology" was published a considerable time ago, its status in the academic community is not diminished by the fact that it is not a new work. Time cannot extinguish the life of a great work, so the Western Philosophy Famous Works Translation Committee of the Chinese Philosophical Society selected and translated James' famous works into a series. In addition to "On the Stream of Thought," there are also single volumes such as "On Habit," "On Emotion," "On Self-Consciousness," and "On Will," which will be published in succession.

This thin booklet of over eighty pages allows one to discover the author's unique system of thought on psychology. He studies psychology from the perspective of physiology and anatomy, breaking the traditional concept of psychologists talking empty-headedly about "consciousness" and delving into the mysterious, laying the foundation for the physiological study of psychology. He particularly studies the influence of thought processes on a person's psychology, and also provides strong arguments for psychology from philosophy. He says that the most basic psychological fact is that there is a thought process taking place, and people's thought processes dominate their psychological activities.

In "On the Stream of Thought," the author elucidates five characteristics of thought. Everyone's thoughts proceed along these five characteristics. The five characteristics of thought he mentions are summarized as: (1) Every thought has a tendency to become a part of personal consciousness. (2) Within each person's consciousness, thoughts are always changing. (3) Within each person's consciousness, thoughts feel continuous. (4) Human thoughts appear to be responding to objects independent of thought. (5) Thought is interested in some parts of these objects, ignores the rest, and accepts or rejects them from moment to moment—selecting among these objects.

From the first characteristic, it is clarified that thoughts are not completely independent of each other, nor are they all connected as one. Thoughts are naturally not isolated. Each thought is with some other thoughts, completely separated from other thoughts. The state of consciousness that we study can only be seen from each specific special me and you. Since every thought has a tendency to become personal, we must grasp the development of thought.

The second characteristic discussed by James believes that thought is constantly changing. Our state of consciousness is constantly changing. No state of consciousness, once past, can be reproduced. At one moment we are listening, at another moment we are looking, at one moment we are reasoning, at another moment we are recalling, at one moment we are loving, at another moment we are hating. The purpose of science is to simplify the complex. The "Theory of Ideas" in psychology is formed by the combination of certain simple and unchanging elements of consciousness that are different from each other. The author believes that every thought we have about a fact is always unique. It is only similar in kind to our other thoughts about the same fact. When the same fact reappears, we must think of it in a new way and look at it from different perspectives.

The author further explains in the third characteristic of thought that everyone's thoughts always feel continuous. Even if there is a break in thought in time, the consciousness after the break always feels that it is connected to the consciousness before the break.

From the continuity and unity of thought, James further developed his fourth characteristic: human thought is responding to objects independent of thought. In other words, thought contains cognitive function. The reason we believe that the objects of our thoughts have a copy of the outside world is that there are multiple human thoughts in the world, each with the same object. The judgment "my thought and his thought have the same object" is the reason why psychologists believe that our thought knows an external object.

In the fifth characteristic, James further explains the selection function of consciousness. Consciousness is always more concerned with some parts of its objects than with other parts, and consciousness often accepts one part and rejects other parts during all the time it thinks. Selective attention and deliberate will are clear examples of the selective activity of thought. All our perceptions have intonation and weight. James also discusses moral concepts, believing that the selection function of thought is above all else. If an action is not selected and practiced from several equally possible actions, then this action has no moral value.

Overall, James' discussion of the characteristics of thought is indeed an important document in the history of philosophy and psychology. In order to confirm the status of concrete experience in psychology, he used physiological and philosophical viewpoints to criticize the traditional view at the time that the results of analysis (such as sensation) were the only psychological reality. He opposed both sensationalism, which believed that a person's state of consciousness only consisted of sensory impressions, and rationalism, which believed that these impressions must be synthesized by a pure intellectual function that is much higher than themselves to have unity. He insisted on his argument: everyone's thoughts are continuous, it is a constant stream. The unity and synthesis of thought are analyzed in detail by James, which can be said to be a major revolution in the psychological community.

### Reading "Sardine"

— Wang Fang

This thin book—"Sardine," is written by Mr. Ba Jin. After reading it, I did not find comfort, but only increased some emotions, perhaps, that is my comfort!

The protagonist in the book, Brother Sheng Yi, is one of those despised as sardines. He is a young man in his twenties. He certainly believed Mr. Zhang's claim that there were ways to make money in the mine, "at least three to five hundred yuan a year," for his own life and future, and left his home and Sister Yin, which he did not want to leave. Sister Yin is his fiancée, a kind and gentle woman, who was initially not at all willing to let him go to dig tin and crawl around underground, out of sight of the sun, especially fearing that his eyes would go blind. However, Sheng Yi was now single-mindedly thinking about the bright silver coins, so many and so crisply ringing. He always thought that Sister Yin's worries were due to excessive love and too much concern because he deeply believed that the forty-something Mr. Zhang (a colleague in the mine) was a good person and would not deceive him. He also planned: to work for two years, no more than seven hundred and several ten days, which would pass quickly. He could get thousands of yuan or the gold and silver treasures he imagined under the mine to settle down his family. In Sheng Yi himself, this was naturally a consistent intuitive thought.

However, Sister Yin always hesitated, thinking, "I won't be able to see this young and beautiful face or hear this gentle and crisp voice within two years. He will go alone to an unfamiliar place to do unfamiliar work, leaving her alone in the public hall to suffer, without any comfort! Comfort! Maybe something will happen during this period, even shattering his entire plan," and therefore was unwilling and almost cried for several days to keep him from going. Finally, Sheng Yi, through all kinds of efforts with his positive thoughts and the words "two years is very short, not long at all, it will pass easily," moved her heart, and she had no choice but to let him go.

Sheng Yi finally left one morning with a group of companions. They walked into the shadowy mountain valley of cliffs, the so-called "dead city," which was located here. All day long, they walked windingly in the remote mountains. Of course, it was very bitter. Their fellow travelers, Lao Zhang, Xiao Wang, and Wu Hongfa, had all kowtowed to Zhao Er's ancestral temple, asking this founder of the mine to bless and take care of them. After walking for one or two days, they arrived at their destination one afternoon—the mining area. However, even the children in the places they passed scolded them, chattering and clamoring that a new batch of "sardines" had arrived. This sentence made them uncomfortable and very angry because they saw that those wild children had a frivolous look and certainly were not well-intentioned. Therefore, they forged their first bad impression. Fatigue and hunger urged them on, so they were sent to a large house, not very bright, and gloomy. They rested on the ground for a while and then squatted on the ground to eat.

Work began. Whether it was raining or sunny, from morning to night, they worked day after day. They had no leisure, no entertainment. At night, they only went to the gambling den to seek a trace of fun. The gambling den was ultimately a place to spend money and cause trouble. Xiao Wang, a companion, was shot and killed by stray bullets in the gambling den. But this matter, Xiao Wang died, was only discovered after they ran away from the gambling den as a group. When they wanted to look for him, they were stopped by that pointed-headed, insidious, triangular-faced mine supervisor. He said, "Are you afraid that no one will bury him?" This group of suffering friends, from then on, suffered another kind of deeper and more inconceivable threat.

In the dark underground work, with gas lamps lit, the pit was damp. As a result, in addition to the darkness and the smell emitted from the ore, there was no good feeling. Hard days really came, the dead died, and the beaten were injured. But other than dying to end it, you can't think of resting or being happy for even a moment. The longer the time, the harder the days, and those despised as sardines were even more bored. Thinking of their despair for their families, they felt even more meaningless. Sheng Yi missed his lovely Sister Yin even more, and finally, he went from being uninterested in "life" to being passive, feeling that death was gradually approaching. Just as the original work wrote: "Because, at any time, every sardine is oppressed by that shadow, that shadow grabs their souls like a ghost."

The shadows gradually gathered, and life gradually changed. They ate poorly, slept poorly, and the work became more and more difficult. A heavy rain finally came, causing the mine pit to be like a lake, a water prison. The pitch-black water became deeper and deeper, and bigger and bigger. They also abandoned their most hated heavy mining hoes and fled towards the mine entrance. This was certainly a chance to escape that they had been seeking, but ultimately they risked finding a way out in the torrential flood.

Everyone disassembled their lives and swam forward. Their mid-way companion—the Scabby Monk, certainly had a silly strength to climb out of the abyss. Lao Zhang couldn't resist the force of the water and was washed away by the rapids and rocks. Then, with a few sounds of water; even Sheng Yi, who was pitifully calling Sister Yin's name, disappeared. How pitiful he was, and how pitiful his companions were, and how even more pitiful that their wishes would be forever shattered in this tribulation. Sister Yin suffered from heavy labor and the ravages of loneliness and died long ago in less than a year!

Spring and Autumn

### The Creation of Character

— Wang Pingling

Dwelling on the deeds of ancient history, imagining the historical figures who created those deeds, casually grabbing one out, describing whether his face is red or white, whether his voice is like a woman or a cat's meow, what kind of clothes he likes, whether he has a beard, this kind of technique is just to draw the outline of the character based on one's own imagination, and does not count as creating the character's personality.

The characteristics of a character, though no more than the following types: happy, melancholy, decisive, hesitant, admonishing, fragile, truthful, hypocritical, kind, cruel, generous, narrow-minded... etc., relative aspects; undoubtedly are shaped by acquired sensibilities, to answer with clear words, is that, in order for humans to fight for existence, they must possess several conditions so that they can closely adapt to the environment of reality, and seek out resources for life in the surging tides of life. Therefore, a person's character is often unavoidably impacted by the torrents of life or gradually deteriorates in the melting pot of the times, losing its original authenticity. For example, a familiar friend moves from place A to place B, and when you meet him again after a few years, his voice and smile may still be the same, but after a little interaction, you will definitely feel that his character has completely changed. This is because, for the sake of life, one has to make one's character more adapted to the demands of reality. Based on this meaning, if writers want to create realistic characters in their works, so that readers do not feel the unfamiliarity and estrangement of the characters, but rather feel that they are lifelike, with blood, flesh, and soul, then you must know the times, experience life, thoroughly understand everything related to life, and swim in the sea of ​​reality at all times.

It is not impossible to create the character of a person from ancient history; but one must collect reliable historical facts, meanings, the spirit of that era, experience the life and habits of that era, and deeply research the impact of the character to be created in that era; only then can the expressed character not be a clay sculpture or wooden carving of a god, but also a person with blood and flesh. Like Sima Qian's description of Xiang Yu, Luo Guanzhong's depiction of Guan Gong, and Shi Nai'an's setting off of Song Jiang, they are very true and close to emotions, and there is absolutely no trace of "deification." This is because they are able to meet the spirit of the ancients and discover the reality of history.

If writers lack a correct philosophical viewpoint as a balance to understand the times and experience life, and if they cannot use imagination, observation, analysis, synthesis, and other methods to find the truth of the facts, then even if you describe the facts that happen today, you may not be able to grasp reality; even if you treat yourself as the object of depiction, it will be like nothingness and ethereal, and you will never be able to get close to reality.

Creating a person's character, because the writer's viewpoints are different, the methods of handling it will also be different. For example: some historians who like to write reversal articles say that Yue Fei was a warmonger, while Qin Hui, who advocated peace, was a loyal minister of the Song Dynasty; Guo Moruo, in his recent play "Qu Yuan," portrays the romantic and suave Song Yu like a clown, a despicable and shameless courtier. Due to the different viewpoints of the writers, they often make the described characters close to innovating and completely deviating from the norm. As for whether it is reasonable, that is the responsibility of the critics.

The responsibility of writers lies in clarifying right and wrong, distinguishing hypocrisy, pursuing light, and indicating truth. The creation of a person's character is entirely based on correct knowledge and according to the development of the story, never infiltrating personal prejudices and biases. However, once it is finalized, the writers should stand on an objective position. They must hate and curse the characters on the dark side and strike them mercilessly; they should do their best to praise and commend the characters on the bright side and sing their praises with utmost care. In this way, the described characters can live on paper and gain deep resonance and reaction in the minds of readers.

### Farewell

— Xie Zi

"Knowing that this separation is inevitable, let's turn tears into smiles!" Even as she said this, her eyes still shimmered with crystalline tears. Indeed, it is better to smile than to weep; parting, whether temporary or permanent, is inherently painful. However, sending someone off with a smile carries a deeper resonance and a sense of resignation.

This happened several years ago. Memory has been diluted by time, but that wistful smile still captivates the heart.

In the course of life, almost every step involves a separation, whether it's a temporary absence or a permanent parting. We encounter many strangers every day. We might only cross paths with these people once, or we might meet again. Even if we do, our memories will be hazy. Sometimes we come across a beautiful girl, and we are drawn to her beauty, unable to resist glancing at her. In her eyes, we might also perceive a faint hint of wistfulness. Yes, in this infinitely vast expanse of time and space, a chance encounter is undoubtedly a form of destiny. But this fleeting opportunity vanishes in an instant, impossible to grasp. In our lives, there are countless such farewells – silent, tearless, sometimes evoking regret in the hazy memories of the future. But why regret? Why regret?

Life is a bitter taste compounded of various flavors, just like black is a composite of different colors. But if we carefully examine it, we can still see traces of different colors within the black – tarnished red, darkened green, scattered purple. And parting, whether temporary or permanent, is like a deep red star twinkling against a background of deep gray.

This starlight represents a hope, a dream – that those who part may reunite, and that those who die may meet again in another world. Everything in this world is unknowable. Within this unknowability lies infinite suffering, but perhaps also a bit of unexpected joy. When true reunions occur, these deep red stars will collide and dazzle each other, like fireworks in the night, illuminating the true face of life.

When friends and relatives gather, I fear the mention of farewells, yet I myself unconsciously tend to bring it up. At such times, the emotion of parting is already dimly felt in everyone's hearts. Just a mention from someone is like the sound of a short flute, gradually awakening the silent violins, the deep double basses, and then the drums and piano, evolving into a grand symphony of parting.

If we observe life with an exploring eye, we can see many mysterious and incomprehensible things. And parting is the most mysterious of the mysterious. Is it governed by human will, or by fate? It always stands within our circle of life, threading together those scattered days into a continuous, systematic string – a string of mysterious pearls, a string of crystalline tears. To seek that wistful smile through these glistening tears is almost heartbreaking.

### Windmill

— By Emile Verhaeren, translated by Da Chun

The windmill slowly, slowly turns in the depths of the night,
Set against a melancholy and worried sky.

It turns and turns, its crimson-purple sails,
Hold endless worry, weakness, stagnation, and weariness.

After dawn, its arms stretch out as if begging for pity,
Rising and falling in turns.

Now again in that gray space,
Sinking in the heavy stupor of nature that seems dead.

Over several villages sleeps a sickly winter day,
Clouds are tired of restless journeys;
Many small woods are gathering their shadows,
And heading to the ends of death are those ruts.

By the ancient pond are a few beech cottages,
Pitifully huddled around;
A copper lamp hangs under the ceiling,
And smiles slip out of the window and from the top of the wall.

On the vast plain, by the quietly sleeping water,
These impoverished huts are peering,
With their poor eyes of glass.

The old windmill turns a circle tired, then turns another and stops.

### Dock (Woodcut)

— By Eric King, USA

### Fragrant Grass, Setting Sun (Plus One Chapter)

— Yang Lianyuan

All afternoon, I dissipated my persistent loneliness in the faint mist exhaled by cigarettes.

...Is this possible? Escaping the clutches of worldly customs, isolating myself far from the bustling city, I love how the trees beyond the wall are burned crimson by the setting sun. In the crimson clouds, a smile flashes; when I stare again, the setting sun hurrying home takes that smile away. So this forest is like a theater after the curtain has fallen, leaving behind a floating life tormented by loneliness and desolation. And that smile, ah, can never be found again in the forest. Yes, I have lost that smile.

Wise men have long told us that life only has a fleeting moment that cannot be repeated, and eternity will not fade! Yes, the smile that flashes in the setting sun is like the eternal smile on a lover's lips as they pass away, but this smile is like weeping, a steel-like brand etched into memory. Seeing this smile is more sorrowful than crying all night. I am like a flowering tree at the end of autumn, having lost the protection of dew. A tree of flowers and leaves is like a poetic verse, the withering flowers and leaves murmur: fragrant grass, setting sun, tomorrow is long in coming! ...

Thinking, the cigarette butt suddenly falls from my fingers, and the ashes scatter by the side of the chair. Alas, I am tired of listening to lingering songs. Just as I lower my head to pick up the fallen cigarette butt, I look up and really see a smile, like a flower blooming in the third month of spring, adorning her face. The picked-up cigarette butt slips again, and just as my eyes escape the encirclement of the blue smoke, I truly greet a smile, a smile descending from heaven, so I bid farewell to the oppressive loneliness, and throw the unlit cigarettes into the fire.

All afternoon, without cigarettes, the fragrant grass and setting sun all become fleeting clouds.

Purple Umbrella

All afternoon, the overcast sky tells a story of demons and monsters. The rain and mist are hazy, and I really worry that it is the ancient, longing wife, Lady White Snake, casting a spell. The beautiful asphalt road and the tram stop are surrounded by holy water. I mock this modern means of transportation, so bitterly made fun of by the sudden holy water. A group of people stand like storks at the station, expressionless, gazing blankly at the surrounding holy water. The story in the sky becomes more and more absurd, and the entire overcast sky seems to be about to press down. I worry that I might have a nightmare-like feeling: is the end of mankind near?

"Ding-ding-dang-dang," the tram bell rings, trying to break through the holy water and speed past. Turning my head, I glimpse a delicate face sheltering under a purple umbrella. With a wave of her hand, she closes the purple umbrella, and the delicate face shines with a cold radiance in the dim sky, nimbly stepping into the carriage. Large raindrops immediately fall, shaking off the confusing nightmare, and I also step into the carriage. "Ding-ding-dang-dang," I am happy that I have once again embarked on a journey.

People who live in crowds all day long also embrace boundless loneliness. For whom do they smile and weep? Pedestrian holding a purple umbrella, please tell me, as you wipe away the raindrops lingering in your hair, someone is rejoicing that you are wiping away the tears in his eyes. The road certainly has no end, and although this train has an end, it will still return, and the crowds are immortal. Purple umbrella, raindrops on the umbrella, raindrops in the hair, your silent plea makes me shed tears.

You are just silently looking at the place you want to go, and I don't want to explore where you want to go. But, where am I going? Answer me, looking at your cold and delicate face, I am once again trapped in a nightmare.

The absurd story being told in the sky should also have an ending. When the purple umbrella moves along a row of fences overgrown with ivy, the sky brightens, and the purple shadow also disappears into the brightness.

### An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 51

— Ye Jingfeng

I held onto Dingyuan, crouching down at the foot of the big tree, while the others scattered to find places to lie low. The branches and leaves above my head were thick, so I couldn't see the sky, but I could hear a buzzing sound approaching from the west, like a small squadron of fighter planes, firing their machine guns intermittently as they flew. At this time, the gunfire in the large forest ahead had stopped. I thought that this squadron was just passing through and would fly away in a few minutes. Who knew that this hateful group would keep circling over our area? Maybe it was because they had heard the sound of heavy machine guns just now? After about twenty minutes of this, they fired another burst of machine guns before slowly heading east.

"These things are so hateful!" Dingyuan hadn't been speaking, but now he opened his mouth, shaking his head at me with a smile. I understood why he had this bit of a smile. You've probably experienced it before: sometimes you encounter a mischievous child, or a shameless rascal, who makes trouble for you, and it's hard to deal with him until he finally leaves. You're in front of your friends, feeling annoyed but also embarrassed to be seriously angry. What do you do? You probably just have to laugh it off. Dingyuan's smile, I think, was of this nature.

I could now see the young leader clearly. He had a missing earlobe on his left ear and bright eyes, with a few traces of elegance. He came running out and gave an order: everyone get back in the cars and proceed in the original order. Each of our cars had a symbol on the windshield, so we weren't stopped by our army's sentries and patrols along the way.

After passing Tiancun, the cars turned south along the highway. The sky was gloomy and oppressive, making me feel like a stone was pressing on my chest, very uncomfortable. After a while, the cars turned southwest again, speeding along. The sound of artillery fire grew louder with each step. When we reached an intersection, we saw that the road to the Yongding River Bridge was blocked by tree branches and scattered wood. Our cars had to stop. At this time, two brothers on the sentry post waved to us, as if telling us to retreat back the way we came. As they waved, they ran toward our cars. Our young leader also got out of the car to meet them. I looked carefully ahead again and saw that there seemed to be some rough defensive works along the roadside, and some brothers were lying there. I thought, this isn't good. This is northwest of Wanping, at least five kilometers away in a straight line. The artillery fire is so close, and there are signs of defenses here. In other words, the front line at Wanping is probably unstable.

After talking with the sentries, the young leader immediately ran to my car, saying that there had been changes in the battle situation at Wanping, and there were stray bullets on this road past the bridge. He asked me, "Do you want to take the long way around, or take this road?" I didn't dare turn around to ask Dingyuan for his opinion, so I just braced myself and replied, "Let's rush past!"

As soon as the cars crossed the bridge, we saw that the fields, hillsides, and riverbanks were like ants, the villagers from all directions, men, women, old, and young, rushing westward. Further ahead, I found bodies lying by the fields. A little further, there was indeed a hissing sound. It was stray bullets flying overhead.

"Huh!" Dingyuan seemed to wake up from a dream. "I remember we took the east side of Wanping this morning, and didn't hear many stray bullets. Now we're on the west side, more than ten li away, how can there be stray bullets?... There should be stray bullets at Changxindian too!..."

How could I answer him? His nerves were very weak, and he was tired after a day like this. If I told him the truth, something very bad might happen. You might say, "Shouldn't you have stopped him from going back to Changxindian?" I agree with this too, but what if there were many unexpected problems in Changxindian that had to be decided by him personally? What would we do then? Besides, he has a strong personality, and he's not a child, so you can't just manipulate him."

"Maybe the front lines have shifted a bit..." I said this lightly. As for the rest, he could just think about it himself.

"So, how's Changxindian?... It's a pity you didn't call before we left Beiping!" His expression gradually became tense.

"It wouldn't have helped, would it?... Because things in war change in an instant... Maybe Changxindian isn't in the target area for now?"

### Illegally Gained Assets

— Shao Fu

The issue of appropriately reserving living expenses for family members during the confiscation of illegally gained assets is still under discussion by relevant authorities and has not yet reached a concrete regulation.

The reason for this is that the person in charge believes there are many difficulties. For example, the amount of illegally gained assets varies greatly. If a fixed amount of living expenses is stipulated, and the total value of many illegally gained assets is less than this amount, what should be done? If a percentage is stipulated, and one-thousandth of many illegally gained assets is enough for the family to live a luxurious life with plenty to spare, what should be done?

From this perspective, it seems very thorny. In fact, those who consider it difficult have not grasped the core of the problem. We know that the reason for reserving a certain amount of living expenses for family members in the Regulations on Punishing Traitors is nothing more than the intention of "punishment not extending to wife and children." Based on this compassionate legal intent, the amount of traitors' assets is by no means the focus of our attention when dealing with them. We only ask whether the assets left are sufficient for the family to live on.

Normally, living expenses have a standard. This standard should be used to determine the amount to be left. If the total value of the illegally gained assets is insufficient, there is no reason for the government to subsidize it. If the amount of illegally gained assets is very large, the family's living expenses should not be increased simply because the total value is large.

It is said that the Illegally Gained Assets Disposal Committee will hold a meeting tomorrow to discuss this matter. I would like to offer this humble opinion to the committee members for reference.

Shanghai Dynamics

### The Origin and Tracks of Scalpers

— Lu Dunfu

Recently, the scalpers in this city seem to be rampant and invincible. Let's start with two recent news stories about "scalpers":

One is that the Shanghai Fish Market sent staff to the North Railway Station to transport arriving fish, but they were intercepted and extorted by several "scalper party members." As a result, the fish market staff reported to the police, who went to suppress them, and only then did the situation calm down.

The other is that a reporter from the Greater America Evening News discovered a certain ×× and a scalper party member hiding in a nearby alley in front of the Great World Theater, dividing the spoils. Just as another ×× wanted to "get a share of the pie," they almost got into a fight. Furthermore, when two scalper party members were trying to sell tickets to the reporter, a certain ×× was enthusiastically encouraging him from the side.

From the first news story, we can see that the potential power of the scalpers is quite "illustrious." They actually "occupy territory" and demand that people passing through their "sphere of influence" pay a "toll"!

From the second news story, it is evident that some ×× are actually acting as "echo chambers" and "tails" for the scalpers! With their wings already formed, and colluding with each other, it is naturally "smooth sailing" and "they are in their element."

What are "scalpers"? The term "scalper" was originally used by Shanghainese to describe people who "have no shoulders" (meaning irresponsible), slippery scalpers, and playboys. The formation of the "scalper party" probably occurred during the enemy-puppet period, with its "place of origin" being the North Railway Station. At that time, railway transportation was chaotic and buying tickets was as difficult as ascending to the heavens! When you were carrying your suitcase, squeezed in the long line, sweating profusely, and feeling like you had nowhere to go, someone would hang around you with a cunning smile, softly asking you, "Where are you going?" He would pull out a large stack of tickets, asking exorbitant prices. In desperation, you would have to grit your teeth and make a deal with him. At that time, there were many "party members" selling black market tickets – the once-famous "black hats" – and they were somewhat organized. Smart Shanghainese people gave them the elegant nickname "scalper party." Although the puppet government also "explicitly" banned them, and "Lord Luo Qingtian" seemed to have "privately investigated" once, publicly executing a "party member" as "a warning to others," his subordinates "did not spare any effort," and the unlucky "martyrs" were, after all, still the founders of the scalper party.

Cannot Be Ignored Therefore, the scalper party gradually expanded its "sphere of influence": to ship docks, travel agencies, airline ticket purchase places, and various streets and corners; wherever they thought there was an opportunity to profit, there were traces of the "party." After the victory, the "legacy" did not disappear. After all, Shanghainese are Shanghainese. In order to admire the thighs of American movies, they could "unsparingly" spend ten thousand yuan on a ticket. The generosity of the gentlemen fueled the development of the scalper party. At the same time, the ticket sellers in the theaters and the ×× who were responsible for suppression further supported the scalpers' misdeeds.

Our authorities naturally cannot ignore this "enemy-puppet legacy." Seeing the recent news reports of "catching scalpers," we earnestly hope that the authorities will make a "thorough elimination" of these "scalpers" and severely investigate and punish those ×× and ticket sellers who collude with the "scalper party"!

### Scarcity Breeds Value

— Zhong Yu

Puyi, the last emperor of the Qing Dynasty, was once regarded by the braid-wearing warlord Zhang Xun as the object of restoration in 1917. After the September 18th Incident, he was spotted by Doihara and made a puppet emperor for fourteen years. Unexpectedly, now he has won the favor of "friendly countries" and is being carefully looked after. This Puyi seems to be a real "rare commodity"; but I don't know what tricks they plan to play after hoarding this "rare commodity"?

### The Ballpoint Pen That Invalidates Checks

— Huang Zixun

Even after a ballpoint pen was used to sign a check that was declared invalid, its value did not decrease. It still provides great help to aviators, swimmers, travelers, and busy people. The general public must be eager to know its structure!

Several years ago, an American scientist announced that he had invented a new type of pen tip that could replace the commonly used pen tips. Its performance was relatively superior, saving ink, not catching on the paper, and with many other advantages. However, it was not adopted until last year. As a result, its advantages were indeed greater than its disadvantages, and its success was unimaginable.

The secret of the ballpoint pen lies entirely in a pen tip. If the reader pays attention, they will definitely find that it is a very small steel ball. This steel ball rotates in a small socket at the tip of the pen. When writing, it rotates and relies on the adhesion of its molecules to absorb a very small amount of ink and distribute it into a thin layer, leaving it on the paper, forming the words you write.

Because it consumes a very small amount of ink and the pen tube has a large capacity, one filling of ink can draw a straight line of twenty-one miles long. On average, with ordinary writing, it can be used for more than two years. After the ink is used up, it can be refilled, just like an ordinary fountain pen. Therefore, the saying that it becomes useless after the ink is used up is inaccurate.

Its pen tube is just an empty tube with a tip to let the ink flow down onto the steel ball. Some are also made movable and replaceable.

At the upper end of the entire pen, there is a small hole that connects to the place where the ink is stored. When the ink cannot be written out, you can blow air into the small hole with your mouth, and it can also balance the pressure on both sides and prevent leakage.

It does not use ordinary ink, but a specially made oily ink, a paste-like substance, with fast-drying properties, drying as it is written.

Its special features are not limited to this, and it can write on clothing. More amazingly, it can write in water, which no other pen can do.

### Above the Graves

— Yi Qian

Some time ago, Wang Bingnan, a spokesman for the Chinese Communist Party, announced that the CCP army would abandon all strongholds and adopt large-scale guerrilla tactics throughout the country. This news is not terrible. But later, according to a United Press dispatch, the Yan'an Radio issued a warning by broadcasting: "What the National Army will find in northern Jiangsu is not paradise, but graves." The radio station also explained why northern Jiangsu would become a grave, saying: "The CCP army in the area has been focusing on guerrilla warfare." The meaning is clear and certain, which cannot help but make the people of northern Jiangsu and even the entire Chinese people feel a sense of humor.

Once northern Jiangsu has the CCP army's guerrilla warfare, it will become a grave. Then, within the scope of the whole country, with the CCP army's guerrilla warfare, it will not be difficult to turn the whole of China into a large grave. This kind of "loyal ambition" of the CCP for the country and the people is certainly worthy of the "applause" of the whole Chinese people. But if the CCP's ambition is really realized, what will the whole of China become like? The answer is:

Below the graves are the people, above the graves is democracy, and democracy stands on the graves, singing loudly "Wildfires cannot burn it out, the spring breeze blows it back to life"!
