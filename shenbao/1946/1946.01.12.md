The conference is scheduled to be held every morning so that the representatives can engage in off-site activities and exchange opinions in the afternoon. Today, because the Standing Committee of the National Political Council is scheduled to meet in the morning, some of the representatives have to attend, so the first formal meeting today will be changed to begin at 3:00 p.m., first discussing the issue of ceasefire. At the opening of the Consultative Conference, Chairman Chiang first announced the issuance of a ceasefire order, and the government's decision to guarantee people's freedom, recognize the legal status of political parties, implement universal suffrage, and release political prisoners and other new measures, which were all considered to have given the Consultative Conference a very good start. Regarding the reorganization of the government and the National Assembly representatives, although opinions differ, the distance is not too far, and it is not difficult to compromise, so the general attitude towards the progress of the consultation is optimistic.

### The Army Must Be Nationalized; The Government Advocates Establishing a Three-Person Panel for Discussion; The Army Headquarters Has Ordered the Implementation of Ceasefire

[United Press, Chongqing, 11th Dispatch] At the first meeting of the Political Consultative Conference today, the government and the Communist Party representatives had a heated debate on whether the issue of army nationalization should be discussed by the Consultative Conference or by a three-person panel. The joint communiqué issued on October 10 stipulated the establishment of a three-person panel. The government adhered to the original plan, but the Communist Party insisted on discussing it by the Consultative Conference. Zhang Qun, the government representative of the three-person committee, reported on the negotiation process and proposed the establishment of a small committee to study the reorganization of the Communist army. Zhou Enlai, the representative of the Communist Party, also reported on the negotiation situation. He opposed Zhang Qun's proposal, believing that the reorganization of the Communist army should be considered by the Political Consultative Conference. Foreign Minister Wang Shijie strongly urged Zhou to accept Zhang Qun's proposal. Zeng Qi, the leader of the Youth Party, supported the government's plan, suggesting that the Political Consultative Conference draft a broad outline, and that the reorganization measures be implemented by a separate small committee. Zhou Enlai then proposed that the meeting should study all army reorganization issues.

It is believed that Bai's mission is related to the implementation of the ceasefire order.

[Our Bengbu Office, 11th Urgent Telegram] Deputy Chief of Staff Bai and the news of the ceasefire agreement arrived in Bengbu at the same time. The citizens were comforted.

An elderly refugee from Shandong in front of Xiaguan Station, upon hearing that the ceasefire order had been issued, shed tears of joy and shouted, "Our Central Army stopped fighting in Qufu long ago.

[Our Peiping Office, 11th Dispatch] The 71st Army has landed in Qinhuangdao.

[Central News Agency, Local Dispatch] The US military headquarters announced yesterday that the work of US ships transporting the New Sixth Army from Shanghai to the Northeast will begin on the 16th of this month. The New Sixth Army's cold-proof equipment has been prepared and they have been vaccinated. As for the detailed method of military transportation, our government and the US military authorities have also negotiated properly.

[United Press, Chongqing, 11th Dispatch] According to the Central News Agency, General Du Yuming is scheduled to take over five cities in the Northeast on the 15th, namely Shenyang, Fushun, Liaoyang, Benxi, and Anshan.

It is reported that part of the army has entered the periphery of Shenyang.

Changchun Has Not Yet Been Taken Over; National Army in Rehe Province Advances

[Our Peiping Office, 10th Dispatch] Although the Northeast Security Force has been airlifted to Changchun, the defense of the area is still under the responsibility of the Soviet army. The Security Force is currently staying quietly in the barracks and has not yet implemented the takeover. The reporter learned from reliable sources that Changchun is still a besieged city surrounded by the Communist Army. There are about 1,000 Communist troops who have infiltrated into Changchun's underground work. There are 10,000 people within 20 miles of Changchun, and 20,000 people outside 20 to 40 miles of Changchun. The Communist Army in the Jilin and Changchun area has been designated as the Jichang Military Region, with Huang Hengyang as the commander, and three detachments under its jurisdiction. Zhang Qinghe, the commander of the first detachment, was the former director of the Changchun Public Security Bureau and is responsible for surrounding Changchun.

[Our Peiping Office, 10th Dispatch] The troops under General Du Yuming are advancing towards Chengde at a speed as if entering an uninhabited area. According to the latest information yesterday, the National Army has advanced west to an area six miles away from Yebaishou. If the Communist Army still collapses at the first blow as in the past, it will only take about a week for Chairman Liu Duoquan to enter Chengde. The officials of the Rehe Provincial Government have advanced to Fuxin. Chairman Liu believes that the National Army is advancing rapidly and political work needs to be carried out urgently. He has telegraphed the officials of the Rehe Provincial Government in Peiping to rush to Jinzhou and head to Rehe.

### No News of the Takeover of Andong; The Mayor of Dalian Can Go to Take Office; Mo Dehui Admonishes the Staff of the Harbin Municipal Government

[Our Peiping Office, 10th Dispatch] The situation in the Northeast is developing forward in a delicate manner. Following Chiang Ching-kuo's trip to the Soviet Union as Chairman Chiang's personal representative, it is rumored here that Madame Chiang will come to Changchun, the nerve center of the Northeast, as the Chairman's wife. This news is not groundless. Compared with the trip to Dihua in the 31st year of the Republic (1942), Madame Chiang's trip seems to have more significant meaning. On the one hand, it symbolizes the friendly trend between China and the Soviet Union, and on the other hand, it shows Chairman Chiang's concern for the Northeast. Looking at the Northeast at this time, it is boundless wind and snow. Madame Chiang's trip should bring immeasurable harmony and warmth to the relationship between China and the Soviet Union in the Northeast, and between the central government and the local government. There is also news in the newspaper that President Song will go to the Northeast to inspect, but this seems to be premature. Admiral Shen Honglie quietly flew here and then flew silently to the Northeast. This old general, who once brought many books to negotiate the first Sino-Soviet treaty and was absent for the second time, is now making another appearance in the extremely delicate and complex situation in the Northeast. It is said that he will help Zhang Jia'ao to deal with some political and economic issues. As of today, it seems that Chiang Ching-kuo is still on his way back to the country. Director Xiong also said that he did not know what the gains of this trip were. There is no news about Andong. This corridor area bordering North Korea and facing the Yalu River will become a powder keg in the Northeast unless a full understanding is reached internationally and a satisfactory result is achieved at the domestic Political Consultative Conference. It is said that the takeover personnel can go to Dalian. In the future, Chairman Gao Xibing of Andong and Mayor Shen Yi of Dalian may have to take a train to take office.

[Central News Agency, Harbin, 10th Dispatch] Mo Dehui and the chairmen of the Songjiang and Nenjiang provinces' receiving committees arrived in Harbin by special train at 2:00 p.m. on the 9th. Kazakov, the Soviet city defense commander, Qiu Fuliaofu, the director of the Changchun Railway Bureau, Wang Zhuting, the deputy director, Yang Chao'an, the mayor, and the heads of various agencies and representatives from all walks of life welcomed them at the station. At 10:00 a.m. on the 10th, Mo Dehui went to the city government to admonish all the staff, and at 2:00 p.m., he visited the Soviet city defense commander, and at 3:00 p.m., he admonished the police.

### The Ratio of Northeastern Circulation Vouchers to Legal Tender is Unofficially 1:13

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 11th Dispatch] Although the exchange rate between the Northeastern Nine Provinces circulation vouchers and legal tender has not yet been officially stipulated, the unofficial price in the local financial market is about 1:13. Banks here have now begun to accept and exchange legal tender according to this exchange rate, and can also handle small remittances between Guan Nei and Guan Wai (inside and outside the Great Wall) according to this exchange rate, but this remittance has not yet begun. This exchange rate will be naturally formed by the prices of goods and transportation conditions between Guan Nei and Guan Wai. After the transportation between Guan Nei and Guan Wai is restored and prices are stabilized, it is possible to fluctuate at any time.

### Zhang Qun Reports on Negotiation Process: If Communist Troops Are Not Reorganized, Cessation of Conflict Is Not Truly Complete

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 11th] On the second day of the Political Consultative Conference, Member Zhang Qun reported on the negotiation process of ceasing military conflict and restoring transportation as follows: Today, the chairman designated me to report on the negotiation process of ceasing military conflict and restoring transportation. The reasons for the military conflict and the obstruction of transportation are not within the scope of my report today.

Regarding the negotiation process, it can be divided into two periods: First, the period of negotiations between the government representatives and the CCP representatives. Since the government representatives proposed measures to avoid conflict and restore transportation to the CCP representatives on October 2nd of last year, after several weeks of negotiation and several weeks of stagnation, the CCP proposed three measures on December 27th of last year, advocating unconditional cessation of conflict before discussing everything else. On the 31st, the government side put forward a concrete plan, stating that the cessation of domestic military conflict has always been the government's consistent position. To achieve this goal, there must be a practical agreement on measures, otherwise, the agreement on the cessation of conflict will be difficult to implement effectively. Therefore, the government put forward three measures: (1) Cease all military conflicts throughout the country and restore railway transportation. (2) Because domestic military conflicts and traffic jams are related to our country's obligations to the Allied countries regarding the surrender and repatriation of enemy prisoners, the government will send one representative and the CCP will send one representative, together with General Marshall, to promptly agree on measures to be submitted to the government for implementation regarding the cessation of military conflict, restoration of railway transportation, and other matters related to surrender. (3) The resident committee of the Senate will appoint five impartial people to form a military inspection team to go to the conflict areas to investigate the military situation, traffic conditions, and other matters related to domestic peace restoration, and submit reports to the public at any time. When the Political Consultative Conference is established, please also appoint impartial people to participate.

Compared with the previous proposals, this method has one characteristic: it combines the problem of the US military assisting the China war zone in China in handling the surrender and repatriation of enemy prisoners with the cessation of military conflict and the restoration of transportation, to achieve a comprehensive solution. Because if the conflict does not stop and transportation does not resume, the problem of surrender and repatriation of enemy prisoners cannot be handled. Other delays and losses are even more incalculable. The CCP representatives generally agreed with this method. After two more negotiations, on the 5th of this month, a unanimous agreement was reached and the following decisions were made. Measures for ceasing conflict and restoring transportation: (1) Cease all military conflicts throughout the country and restore all transportation. The order to cease conflict and restore transportation shall be agreed upon in accordance with the provisions of Article 2. (2) Because domestic military conflicts and traffic jams are related to our country's obligations to the Allied countries regarding the surrender and repatriation of enemy prisoners, the government and the CCP shall each send one representative, together with General Marshall, to promptly agree on measures to be submitted to the government for implementation. (3) The resident committee of the Senate and the Political Consultative Conference will each appoint eight impartial people other than the KMT and CCP parties to form a military inspection team. Together with representatives from both the KMT and CCP, they will go to the conflict areas throughout the country to inspect the military situation, traffic conditions, and other matters related to the restoration of domestic peace, and submit reports to the public at any time. The above is the period of negotiations between the government representatives and the CCP representatives.

Second, the period of consultations among the government representatives, the CCP representatives, and General Marshall. This consultation is called the "Three-Person Meeting." From the 7th of this month to the day before the opening of this conference, a total of six meetings were held. The main points of the document. This statement is not only of concern to all of you gentlemen at this conference, but also to compatriots throughout the country, and friendly countries in the international community are also concerned. You gentlemen must have already read the above records, so I won't say much more today. The government has already issued an order yesterday, and in accordance with the time limit agreed with the CCP representatives, it will be implemented uniformly before 12:00 pm on the 13th of this month, regardless of location. Naturally, it is based on the measures agreed upon by the government representatives and the CCP representatives on the 5th. The achievements of this conference can be seen in the statement jointly issued by me and Mr. Zhou Enlai, the CCP representative, yesterday morning. A total of four documents were signed: (1) Draft of the order to cease conflict, (2) Matters of Understanding (the above two documents were signed jointly by the three people) (3) Military Mediation Executive Department, (4) Joint Statement (these two documents were signed by representatives of both the government and the CCP).

The content of the joint statement includes: (1) (2) (3) three

Regarding the establishment of the Military Mediation Executive Department, the announcement only contains the main points, and I will now supplement a few points: (1) The Military Mediation Executive Department was established to facilitate the implementation of the cessation of conflict and the restoration of transportation, and to smoothly complete the tasks of disarming the enemy and repatriating enemy prisoners. Its tasks are clearly defined. (2) The Military Mediation Executive Department will have three members. The United States has appointed Chargé d'Affaires Robertson, the government has appointed Zheng Tingwei Jie Min from the Ministry of Military Affairs, and the CCP has appointed Chief of Staff Ye Jianying. They can go to Beiping the day after tomorrow to start work. (3) For the operating procedures of the Military Mediation Executive Department, each of the three members has one vote, and all matters must be unanimously approved by the three people. Necessary orders are issued downward in the name of the Chairman of the National Government, and reports are submitted upward by the affiliated executive group, which are prepared daily and sent by each member to their respective leaders. (4) The work of the Military Mediation Executive Department is promoted by the executive group. The director of the executive group is a US military officer who supervises the relevant troops and has the power to issue and convey all orders and instructions. Necessary locations may also set up branch stations or dispatch monitoring or reporting teams. (5) The Military Mediation Executive Department will continue to exist and carry out its work until the government or the CCP notifies its abolition.

The above points were not mentioned in the announcement. In order to let everyone understand the whole picture, I will make a special supplementary report. During the Three-Person Meeting, everyone had a spirit of mutual understanding and concession, and all negotiations proceeded smoothly. The government is now proposing the following three items that are not subject to the restrictions of the cessation of conflict measures and must be treated as exceptions: The first item is about military reorganization, the second item is about receiving the northeastern provinces, and the third item is about receiving Chifeng and Duolun. Agreement was reached on the first two items, but the third item was strongly opposed by the CCP representatives, so a final decision could not be reached at the afternoon meeting on the 9th. The government sincerely hopes that this meeting will be successful and that the order to cease conflict can be announced before the Political Consultative Conference, so it made a final concession and incorporated this proposal into the Rehe-Chahar issue for a comprehensive solution. It is not treated as an exception when this agreement to cease conflict is established. When the meeting on the 9th did not yield results, there was speculation outside that the government had made some new proposals, which led to the occurrence of twists and turns, and this was the reason for it. After the Three-Person Meeting passed all the proposals, I suggested that, based on the Three-Person Small Group previously clearly defined by the government representatives and the CCP representatives, it should be established immediately to carry out the reorganization of the CCP's troops. Because military conflict between the two sides is an unfortunate thing, it is a good thing that the Three-Person Meeting has negotiated a cessation of measures to turn hostility into harmony, but the cessation of conflict has not truly resolved the problem. After the order to cease conflict is issued, the Three-Person Small Group can be quickly established, and concrete implementation measures can be re-negotiated and implemented regarding the reorganization of the CCP troops and the regulations for their stationing. That would be considered a true solution to the problem. In other words, it means that the organization and measures currently established to implement the order to cease conflict will no longer exist, and that will be considered the true completion of our mission to cease conflict. At that time, General Marshall expressed that he considered it important and was willing to use all the work of the Three-Person Meeting to urgently suggest that the Three-Person Small Group should proceed as soon as possible. Mr. Zhou Enlai, the CCP representative, still had no objection. Today, I would like to conclude my report with this, because during the effective implementation period of the order to cease conflict, if the issue of the reorganization and stationing of the CCP troops is not resolved quickly, neither the demobilization, reorganization, and rehabilitation of the military, nor the political and economic construction can proceed smoothly, and the burden and suffering of the people on all sides cannot be alleviated. You gentlemen are extremely concerned about this issue and should be reported in detail, but all the situations and related documents have been published, and today I am limited by time, so I can only make a brief report, and I ask you gentlemen for your forgiveness.

### Second Day of the United Nations General Assembly: Selection of Committee Members Determined; US, Soviet Union, UK, China, and France Elected as Vice Presidents of the General Assembly; Non-Permanent Members of the Security Council Also Agreed Upon

[United Press, London, 11th] Today is the second day of the United Nations General Assembly. According to reliable sources, the internal distribution of power has been decided. The US, Soviet Union, UK, China, and France will each receive a seat as Vice President of the General Assembly. The remaining two vice president seats are internally designated for India and Venezuela. The chairmen of the various committees have also been internally designated as follows: The Chairman of the Political and Security Committee belongs to Ukraine, the Chairman of the Economic Committee belongs to Holland, the Chairman of the Social Welfare Committee belongs to New Zealand, the Chairman of the Trusteeship Committee belongs to Uruguay, the Chairman of the Administrative Committee belongs to Syria, and the Chairman of the Legal Committee belongs to Panama. The Security Council has the greatest power, and the future international police will be under its command. In addition to the US, Soviet Union, UK, China, and France as permanent members, the remaining six seats will probably be decided by tomorrow. The British Commonwealth can obtain one seat on the Council, and Canada and Australia are competing fiercely. The remaining five seats will probably belong to Colombia and Mexico, as representatives of South America and Central America, Belgium representing Western Europe, Poland representing Eastern Europe, and Egypt representing the Middle East. Regarding the candidates for Secretary-General of the General Assembly, it is heard that the five major powers will hold a meeting tonight to decide. The US and Britain favor Canadian Ambassador to the US Pearson, while the Soviet Union favors Yugoslav Ambassador to the US Šumik. A final decision will probably be made after Soviet Chief Representative Vyshinsky arrives.

[Reuters, London, 11th] UN General Assembly President Spaak this morning requested the Assembly to establish a temporary committee to investigate the amendment proposed by Cuba and decide whether or not to adopt it. The motion proposes the establishment of a committee with fifty-one members, with one member from each delegation, whose work would be strictly limited. It is widely believed that the purpose of this motion is to avoid the establishment of a general small committee with only fourteen members, which could potentially make important political decisions. After delivering his opening remarks, Spaak also requested the Assembly to allow the Executive Secretary and his staff to carry out the work of the Secretary-General and the Secretariat of the Assembly until a formal Secretary-General is appointed. This motion was unopposed and was therefore passed. In addition, the Colombian representative was asked to present the report of the Preparatory Committee.

Spaak's Opening Remarks: Said That Promoting the Interests of All Countries Is Necessary to Eliminate Differences

[Reuters, London, 11th] The United Nations General Assembly held its second day of meetings today. At the opening of the meeting, Spaak stood up to address the meeting and expressed his gratitude for being elected as the President of the Assembly. Mr. Shi spoke in French in a sonorous and forceful tone, which lasted for twelve minutes. The whole room was filled with cheers. The main points of Mr. Shi's speech were: The great task of the United Nations Organization, if it is to be successful, requires an international spirit. Mr. Shi's speech began by saying: He felt satisfied with his election, but also had a sense of regret. Because his friend Lei Yi, the Norwegian Foreign Minister who represents the heroic people of Norway, was not elected. He fully understood the meaning of choosing Lei Yi as a candidate for President. And he felt the same way as the representatives who voted in favor of him. Mr. Shi then welcomed all the representatives in his capacity as President, and paid special tribute to Mrs. Roosevelt, calling it the most glorious and respected name. The death of the great man, President Roosevelt, was mourned by everyone. The whole audience cheered in unison. Mr. Shi continued: "I feel the same way about the remarks made yesterday about Lei Yi and the heroic people of Norway. I am deeply grateful for your vote of confidence. I would also like to explain that those who voted for Lei Yi wanted to praise him and his country. I understand this very well. I now look around and see many representatives who are dedicated to peace, far better than me, and more qualified than me to receive this honor, which makes me feel ashamed." At this point, Mr. Shi wished to say a few words about the start of the conference, saying: The world has had this kind of test, and this is not the first time. But the first test, unfortunately, was not successful. This may not need to be repeated, but the lessons of the past can ultimately enlighten the future. During the period between the two world wars, we failed to form an international spirit. In order for our work to succeed, an international spirit is necessary. In a conference such as the United Nations Organization, we must make great efforts to eliminate differences. Our task is to promote the interests of all countries, but this interest must be expanded into a general interest before we can succeed.

During the Election of the President, the Oval Office Temporarily Recommended the Norwegian Foreign Minister, But the Belgian Foreign Minister Was Still Elected

[Reuters, London, 11th] Representatives of fifty-one countries began working together at 4:00 PM yesterday (12:00 AM Shanghai time) to establish a "safe and free world built on justice and humanitarianism." Dr. Chu Laite, representative of Colombia and Chairman of the Preparatory Committee, slowly rose from his crimson seat in the crowded Central Hall of London on the 25th anniversary of the founding of the first League of Nations, and opened the prelude to the second conference to establish lasting peace. The privilege of presiding over the opening of the conference was obtained by a representative of a small South American republic, which shows that all members of the United Nations Organization enjoy sovereign equality. The venue was silent, and the representatives were sitting upright. Then, British Prime Minister Attlee stood up to thank the temporary chairman and welcome politicians from all over the world. Prime Minister Attlee also gave the conference the motto he had previously announced in Geneva: "Peace is indivisible." (For the full text of Attlee's speech, see the relevant column in the upper right corner of this edition.) The most tense situation yesterday was during the election of the President after Prime Minister Attlee's speech. It was expected before the meeting that the whole room could unanimously elect Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak as President, but Soviet representative Gromyko suddenly moved to elect Norwegian Foreign Minister Lie as President. The delegations of Ukraine, Denmark, and Poland also seconded the motion. Regarding the voting method, fifteen delegations favored secret, nine delegations favored public, and twenty-seven delegations abstained. This matter was so unexpected that people did not know what to decide. Therefore, so many people abstained. As a result, it was decided to vote secretly. When the ballots were counted, it was announced that Spaak was elected as President with 28 votes against 23 votes. Cheers immediately rose, and Spaak ascended the podium to thank all the representatives and temporary Chairman Chu Laite, and announced that he would deliver his official inaugural speech today. At the same time, he officially announced the convening of the first meeting of the General Assembly of the United Nations Organization.

### Our Representative's Attitude Towards the United Nations Organization: Constructive Rather Than Critical; We Can Make Concessions in Anything That Helps the Organization

[United Press, London, 10th] A senior Chinese official told United Press today, "China's cooperation with international organizations is still in its early stages. If it can help the work of the new organization, China is willing to make slight concessions in certain aspects." He pointed out that China's attitude towards the United Nations Organization is "constructive rather than critical." The official said: China has no special opinions on the selection of the executive organ of the United Nations Organization, but he hopes that China can participate in it. When asked for his opinion on the trusteeship system, he said: This system must have a time limit, after which these countries should be returned to their respective peoples.

### Egypt Occupies a Seat on the Security Council and Trusteeship Council

[United Press, London, 10th] As representatives of 51 countries to the United Nations General Assembly conduct their meetings, it appears certain that Egypt will be elected as a member of the United Nations Organization's Security Council and Trusteeship Council. United Press has learned from reliable sources that Egypt can obtain extensive assistance and sit on the Security Council alongside the five powers of the US, China, Soviet Union, UK, and France, as well as five other countries. The direct work of the council is to consider all possible ways to prevent the disruption of peace when major crises occur anywhere in the world. According to the Egyptian representative, Security Council membership will be based on geographical distribution. Egypt can participate in the Security Council for two main reasons: First, Egypt enjoys treaty relations with Britain and other countries, and as a key point of Britain's transportation lines, it seems like a naturally suitable member. Second, Egypt has been recognized as the leader of the Arab countries, and therefore can be supported by the countries of the Arab League, including Iraq, Lebanon, and Saudi Arabia, all of which are members of the United Nations General Assembly. There is a natural sympathy between Ethiopia and the Arab countries, so observers believe that Ethiopia will also support Egypt. Moreover, Egypt played an important role in the debates of the Preparatory Committee. The Middle East is a sensitive part of the world in the relations between countries, so the Arab countries are determined to have a voice in the Council that decides future policies. Britain has proposed that the responsibility for resolving the Middle East issue be handed over to the United Nations Organization. Informed sources believe that this is another argument to strengthen the representation of Arab countries. The issue of Ibon's relations with the Soviet Union, the issue between the Near East and France, Egypt's demands on Britain to revise the 1936 treaty, and the issue of greater administrative power over Sudan, are all sufficient to allow Arab countries to seek a stronger voice. Britain has decided to hand over its issues to the United Nations Organization, so the Arab countries believe that they must obtain representation on the Trusteeship Council.

### Soviet Union Praises the United Nations Conference

[United Press, Moscow, 10th] Moscow Radio broadcast said: "The first plenary session of the United Nations General Assembly opened under favorable conditions after the foreign ministers of the three powers reiterated cooperation among the three countries. The General Assembly should make a concrete contribution to laying a just and lasting peace."

### Indian Chief Representative Concerned About the Trusteeship Committee

[United Press, London, 10th] Sir Ramaswami Mudaliar, the chief representative of India to the United Nations General Assembly, told reporters today, "The Indian delegation is extremely concerned about the Trusteeship Committee, because the future of the countries under mandate in the future, especially those in the southeastern region of India, is of vital interest to us. The establishment of the Trusteeship Council will still take some time. It cannot be established until the General Assembly invites the countries that previously held mandates in the League of Nations and the directly related states to conclude a harmonious agreement. This agreement was first reviewed by the Trusteeship Committee and then submitted to the General Assembly." When asked by reporters whether India should occupy a seat on the Trusteeship Committee, Sir said, "India's participation is a must." Sir served as Chairman of the Social and Economic Committee at the Preparatory Assembly and the San Francisco Conference. When reporters inquired whether there was a possibility of continuing to serve as Chairman of the committee at the General Assembly, Sir did not discuss it, but believed that the work of the committee would take three years to complete. It is also understood that the Security Council and other committees must change chairmen at each session, but the Chairman of the Social and Economic Committee serves a one-year term, and one of its tasks is to convene an international trade conference this summer.

### Complete Text of Attlee's Speech

[United Press, London, 11th] The United Nations General Assembly opened on the 10th at Central Hall, Westminster, London. British Prime Minister Attlee delivered the opening speech last night (Shanghai time, 1:30 AM yesterday morning). The full text is as follows:

I am greatly honored to welcome the representatives of the United Nations to London. First, I must thank Mr. Sheng for his speech. As Chairman of the Preparatory Commission of the United Nations, he shouldered a difficult mission and achieved today's success. We are all deeply impressed. I learned from my colleagues that the Preparatory Commission was fortunate to have Mr. Sheng's guidance. Without his talent, sense of responsibility, and guidance to his colleagues, we might not have a draft for the General Assembly to discuss today.

I sincerely hope that this General Assembly will have the same spirit of diligence, practicality, and cooperation as the Preparatory Commission. In the Preparatory Commission, although major issues were debated frankly and intensely, a spirit of coordination and goodwill also existed, so the results were able to converge.

Since we welcome you to London, we will do our best to make you feel at home in our capital and express your opinions freely and frankly, as if you were gathered on a special territory under international co-management. We will, within the possible range, make your stay in England pleasant and comfortable. If there is any inadequacy in our hospitality, we hope that you will understand that this ancient city is experiencing shortages due to enemy ravages. It is by no means due to our lack of sincerity. What you see around you is proof of this.

Last night, His Majesty the King, representing the British Commonwealth, mentioned in his short and moving speech the nature of the tasks we must accomplish. The current situation is grave, and each member of the British Commonwealth is eager to see the initial success of the United Nations.

The United Nations Charter originated from the San Francisco Conference, which I also attended. When the conference was initiated, the enemy was still at war, and the conference symbolized confidence in victory and a reaffirmation of the war aims. The preamble and Article 1 of the Charter state the aims and principles of the conference, which are wholeheartedly supported by His Majesty's Government and unanimously trusted by the people of this country, regardless of party affiliation.

In my lifetime, war has twice brought indescribable sorrow to mankind. If a third war were to occur, the progress of civilization would inevitably stagnate, and the centuries of human effort would be destroyed. The preamble to the United Nations Charter expresses lofty ideals, for which countless men and women have given their lives in war. Defining principles is not difficult, but turning ideals into reality is not easy.

People are easily motivated to realize ideals when stirred by war. In the summer of 1920, when this country faced the threat of invasion, the entire nation rose up with one goal, and immediately took action. Men and women eagerly participated in the work, adapting to the needs of the time. This goal remained the same throughout the five years of war. During these five years, countries successively joined the war, and workers' groups in the rear cooperated, working together towards the goal of victory. In the process of cooperative and concerted efforts, the individual ambitions of each country disappeared imperceptibly.

Today, our weapons have been crowned with the laurels of victory. Our task is to quickly establish lasting peace. The spirit of selflessness and sacrifice that nations showed in times of trouble and war is still necessary today. We must fully recognize the importance of our mission and complete it together.

In the future, when deciding world diplomatic policy, the United Nations organization should be considered first. After the First World War, ordinary diplomatic policy always took [something] as a premise and overlooked the League of Nations. In the past, British nobles had armed retinues, but over time, they were gradually regulated by the government, and private armies eventually disappeared. The same principle should apply to the world's armed forces, which should all be subject to restraint. We must recognize the indivisibility of peace, as declared by the Soviet Foreign Minister in Geneva. The aggression launched by Japan in the Far East and the aggressive actions of Italian fascists were not properly addressed, resulting in the tearing up of laws. The five years of Nazi aggression dragged the entire world into a vortex of war. Today, our happiness is more interconnected than ever before. The United Nations Charter includes the simple basic needs of individuals and recognizes that individual freedom within a country is an appendage to the freedom of nations in the United Nations.

I have stated that establishing peace and preventing war is an unprecedentedly urgent task. In the past, our country had the ocean as a barrier, allowing us to live in peace. Today, it is easier to understand that we have entered a new era. Powerful weapons and the destruction wrought over long distances have dispelled our illusion of living in a secluded and safe haven. We have received many warnings. The emergence of the atomic bomb can be said to be the last warning. If its destructive power is uncontrolled, the highest civilization of mankind will face the calamity of complete destruction.

Therefore, I have decided to entrust the entire issue of atomic energy control to the United Nations organization. This is the major problem facing the world today. The representatives of all countries must make a choice between life and death. I deeply hope and believe that the representatives present here today have come to England not only with determination but also with hope. Those who are skeptical and pessimistic will always have war. If the League of Nations failed in this way, how can there be hope for the United Nations organization?" They do not know that the progress of civilization is a chain of failures and lessons learned. The labor movement is a history of failures. After each failure, skeptics say: "The workers' stubborn interests are too strong, and they cannot unite." As a result, the workers united.

I have strong confidence in the success of the United Nations organization. We have learned a lot from past mistakes. The old League of Nations failed because it was incompetent, mainly because the governments of the United States and the Soviet Union did not participate during its formation.

Today, the countries of the world are more united than ever before, and the new organization's charter stipulates the use of force to guarantee its laws.

I believe that the common people of all countries in the world must also recognize the crisis facing the world today. To make the United Nations organization a living reality rather than an ideal, we should not only obtain the support of governments but also the support of people all over the world.

Our goal is to achieve a world free from fear and poverty. Economic insecurity is more lasting than the terror of war. Without social security, there is no foundation for peace. Therefore, economic and security work in the conference should have international power. In addition, an international police force is also necessary, but the safer and more satisfied the people of the world feel, the less need there will be for police.

For individuals, economic insecurity is a more lasting and significant shadow than war. Everyone should understand that everything discussed in this conference concerns everyone and will affect everyone's families and lives.

Finally, we may as well examine what peace really is. Peace is the absence of war, the establishment of a safe and free world. And this world is governed by justice and moral laws, with authority restraining power and public good overcoming private desires. We can gather here today in this home of free laws, all because brave men and women suffered or died. We are able to live. We must always remember this great sacrifice and inherit the achievements of the martyrs with courage, patience, and a spirit of sacrifice. We must succeed, and we will surely succeed.

### Cabinet Decides on Reorganization; Discussions All Day Result in No Resignation En Masse; Names and Numbers of Resigning Cabinet Members Not Announced

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 11th] The Shidehara Cabinet, established three months ago, met today to discuss its future. Towards evening, Cabinet Secretary Tsuda announced that the cabinet had decided to reorganize to adapt to MacArthur's instructions to resolve the political crisis.

[United States Information Service, Washington, 10th] According to Acting Secretary of the Army Royall's announcement yesterday: General of the Army Eisenhower has instructed overseas troop commanders to expedite the repatriation of foreign-stationed troops who are not militarily needed, regardless of scoring standards. Royall also said that the Department of the Army is reviewing the entire demobilization situation and will soon formulate a detailed plan.

### Truman Considered Establishing a Federation of European Countries, But Believes It Should Not Be Identical to the United States

[United Press, New York, 9th] American political commentator Kreyer recently wrote in "Collier's" magazine that President Truman has considered whether European countries could form a federation, believing that this federation is essential for stability, peace, and prosperity. The president's intention is not to require the European federal organization to be completely identical to the United States, but it must use the same currency, conclude a customs union, jointly develop natural resources, and use waterways. The reason why the president considered forming a federation of European countries was to solve the following two major problems: (1) How can the U.S. government effectively assist Europe's recovery until Europe can make good use of the assistance it receives? (2) Europe has tariffs and trade restrictions, and the currency system is chaotic, making transactions impossible and isolating urban industrial areas from rural areas. Under these circumstances, what real hope is there for Europe's recovery? For example, Norway needs salt produced in Italy, and Italy needs fish produced in Norway. The German mining areas produce a lot of coal, while Denmark, Hungary, and the Netherlands are rich in food, and can exchange food for German coal. However, due to the current trade barriers, it is impossible to exchange goods with each other. If European countries eliminate their fears and hatreds and treat each other like family, they will inevitably expand their military preparations in the future. If countries do not stop using their resources for military buildup, the living standards of the people will not be improved. The President believes that if the United States unfortunately adopts the current policies of European countries or becomes as divided as Europe, the United States will fall into chaos. The late French politician Briand and former British Prime Minister Churchill both advocated that Europe should be integrated, and those who opposed this plan were only arms dealers and nationalist politicians. Switzerland can be regarded as a "miniature of the European Federation," with all its twenty-two cantons united into a federal nation. The European Federation advocated by Americans will not include Britain and the Soviet Union, because including the Soviet Union would be tantamount to extending the scope of Europe to the Pacific region. Soviet power will unbalance the European Federation. After the European Federation is formed, there can be several benefits, because under this system, countries will have no imperialist ambitions, and the Soviet Union can no longer worry about the emergence of a "Western bloc," and devote all its efforts to developing its own resources. Britain can take the opportunity to focus on solving its own problems, and the United States can also generate a belief that the money currently used in Europe will lay a solid foundation for Europe.

### Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Arrives in Bulgaria to Discuss Cabinet Reorganization

### Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France Prepare to Conclude a Peace Treaty with Italy

[United Press, Washington, 10th] According to reliable sources today: The British government has sent a note to the United States, the Soviet Union, and France, requesting that the foreign ministers of each country immediately prepare to conclude a peace treaty with Italy. Britain and the United States both agree to entrust the Italian colonies to the United Nations for trusteeship.

Suzhou

Large Number of Flour Merchants Arrested

Recently, the price of flour in Suzhou has been rising steadily, which has a significant impact on people's livelihoods. The reason for this is that flour merchants have been operating a "flour tea party" at the Guanyuan Street, Yuanmiao Guan, and East Corner Gate of the Dadong Tea House. There are often more than two hundred people from the flour industry and other trades that engage in short selling and manipulation of the market. This matter was discovered by the military and police authorities. On the morning of the tenth, at 11 o'clock, military organs, together with the police bureau, dispatched personnel to arrest fifty or sixty people from both the flour industry and other trades who were engaged in the tea party transactions, and severely punished them. At the same time, the tea house was notified that it would no longer be allowed to hold such events.

### United Nations General Assembly Highlights

Osmanthus Leaves Symbolize Peace, Arab Delegates' Distinctive Attire

[Reuters, London, 11th] On the second day of the United Nations General Assembly today, the fifty-one United Nations delegates braved the drizzling rain and hurriedly walked along the sidewalk, where crowds cheered yesterday but which was rather quiet today, to enter the Central Hall of Westminster and listen to the formal speech of the first Secretary-General of the Assembly, Spaak (Belgian Foreign Minister). The public seats in the hall, which were packed yesterday, had some empty seats today.

[Reuters, London, 11th] Yesterday, the magnificent gold and blue Central Hall was filled with 350 delegates. The most notable absentee was the Soviet chief delegate and Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Vyshinsky. He had not yet completed his mission in Romania and could not arrive in time. The hall was brightly lit with electric lights. The most striking decoration was a huge world map, representing the United Nations emblem, surrounded by osmanthus leaves, symbolizing peace. Below the huge map was the podium, with a light-colored long table and two loudspeakers. Dr. Chu Lai-Tai, the temporary chairman, sat on it. In front of the podium was the speaker's stand, also with two loudspeakers. At the chairman's request, each speaker spoke from there. Directly opposite the podium were the seats of the delegates from South Africa, Turkey, and Syria. To their left were the delegates from Saudi Arabia. The five delegates were dressed in brown Arab robes and white silk headscarves, which were the most distinctive attire among the delegates from various countries. The delegates from the three great powers, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, formed a triangle on the right side of the hall. When the temporary chairman, Dr. Chu Lai-Tai, stood up to speak, the entire hall fell silent. The doctor spoke in somewhat unnatural French, which was quickly translated into English.

[Reuters, London, 11th] The Soviet delegation nominated Norwegian Foreign Minister Lie as president because Norway was the first victim of German aggression, the Norwegians were staunch fighters for democracy, and Lie was an experienced politician. In 1940, when the German army invaded Norway, Lie was the last of the Norwegian ministers to escape from Oslo to London. Lie, 49, is a lawyer by profession, tall and athletic, and was defeated in a secret vote at the General Assembly.

[Reuters, London, 11th] Spaak served as prime minister for nine months, the youngest of the prime ministers in Europe, and is known for this. Spaak is physically strong. He was the first female senator in Belgium. In May 1938, she became Belgium's first socialist prime minister. In September 1939, she became foreign minister. When Belgium was invaded, she narrowly escaped capture by the German army. Although she eventually escaped with other members of the Belgian government to London, her family had to be abandoned in Belgium.

### US Secretary of Army Says Before Leaving Japan That the Japanese Emperor Need Not Abdicate, US Troops to Be Reduced to 400,000 by May

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 11th] US Secretary of the Army Patterson has completed his inspection here and departed for China and the Philippines. Today, before his departure, he told Japanese reporters that Emperor Hirohito need not abdicate for his war responsibilities and that this matter should be decided by the Japanese people themselves. The entire question of the Japanese imperial family is covered by the Potsdam Agreement. Patterson greatly praised MacArthur and the occupying forces. He also said that the number of American troops in the Pacific could be reduced to 400,000 by May. He said he had not heard of any requests from the Soviet Union or China to send occupying forces to Japan. Patterson did not admit that there were any problems with the implementation of the demobilization plan. The Department of the Army had carefully planned the orderly demobilization. The number of demobilized personnel is also being accelerated compared to what was estimated last August and September, he said.

### Political Consultative Conference: Remarks by Attending Members, President Sun Ke Elucidates Government's Position

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 10th] A Central News Agency reporter visited President of the Executive Yuan, Sun Ke, on the afternoon of the 10th to discuss the Political Consultative Conference. President Sun Ke gave the following statement:

Reporter: This morning's opening of the Political Consultative Conference and President Chiang's opening remarks, as well as the government's automatic announcement of measures concerning four issues: freedom of the people, the legal status of political parties, universal suffrage, and political prisoners, were very inspiring. However, those who were unable to attend the meeting are not fully aware of the government's position in this conference, as the newspapers have not yet disclosed it. Could you please comment on this?

President Sun: The purpose of President Chiang's convening of this Political Consultative Conference is to solicit the opinions of all parties and factions, as well as prominent figures outside the government, in order to resolve the current domestic problems of peace, national construction, democracy, and unity. The government will expand the basis of the government under the existing legal system so that everyone can participate together in the government structure during the transitional period before the start of constitutional government and share political responsibility.

Reporter: How will the various parties and factions and prominent figures in society participate in the government structure during this transitional period?

President Sun: The government plans to start by revising the Organic Law of the National Government, expanding the National Government Committee to serve as the highest policy guidance organ. The specific measures are: (1) Expanding the number of members of the National Government Committee. (2) Members of the National Government Committee may be appointed by the Chairman of the National Government upon nomination from outside the party.

Reporter: After the National Government Committee is expanded and reorganized in this way, what new provisions will be made regarding its powers?

President Sun: After the expansion and reorganization, the powers of the National Government Committee will be the same as those of the current Supreme National Defense Council, that is, the powers formerly exercised by the Central Political Conference. The matters discussed and decided by the National Government Committee will include the following six categories: [A] Legislative principles, [B] Administrative policies, [C] Military and political plans, [D] Financial plans and budgets, [E] Matters referred by the Chairman, [F] Suggestions jointly submitted by one-third or more of the committee members.

Reporter: After the National Government Committee decides on the above matters, will they be immediately implemented?

President Sun: The decisions should be implemented, but if the Chairman of the National Government believes that it is difficult to implement the decisions of the National Government Committee, he may submit them for reconsideration. If two-thirds or more of the committee members insist on maintaining the original proposal, the decisions should be implemented.

Reporter: According to this provision, must all major national affairs be discussed and decided by the National Government Committee before they can be handled?

President Sun: If there are major domestic incidents or urgent foreign affairs that cannot wait for the National Government Committee to make a decision, the Chairman of the National Government may take expedient measures and then report to the National Government Committee. After expansion and reorganization, the National Government Committee will be the highest political organ in the national system. In Nanjing, there was a period when the National Government Committee meeting was the highest organ of the government.

Reporter: After the National Government is expanded and reorganized, will the organization of the Executive Yuan undergo considerable changes?

President Sun: The government proposes that the Executive Yuan should appoint several political affairs ministers who may also serve as ministers of various departments.

Reporter: Will the May 5th Draft Constitution be revised in this two-week Political Consultative Conference?

President Sun: The government proposes to appoint experts to form a committee to collect, organize, and submit the opinions from all parties for adoption by the National Assembly. However, the principles of the May 5th Draft Constitution may be discussed by the Political Consultative Conference.

Reporter: The government has announced that the National Assembly will be convened on May 5th of this year. Will the date be changed?

President Sun: The National Assembly to be convened on May 5th of this year is a constitutional assembly. The government originally planned to convene it in the 26th year of the Republic [1937], but the war of resistance broke out and the government moved westward, so it had to be postponed. Therefore, the government believes that the constitutional National Assembly should not be postponed again.

Reporter: Regarding the representatives of the National Assembly, some outside parties have proposed re-election. What is the government's opinion?

President Sun: The elected representatives were originally elected based on the Organic Law of the National Assembly and the Election Law promulgated by the government. These laws only stipulate that the representatives are responsible for drafting the constitution and deciding the date of its implementation, and there is no provision for a term of office. This first National Assembly is not a National Assembly established in accordance with the constitution, but only has a task and no term of office. Therefore, the government cannot agree with the view that the original elected representatives are invalid and should be completely re-elected. A complete re-election would inevitably increase disputes. At the same time, it would not be possible to meet the deadline of convening the meeting on May 5th. The government's opinion is that, in addition to those who have already been elected, the remaining seats will be reasonably increased to give all parties and social figures ample opportunity to participate. After the completion of its task, this first National Assembly will be dissolved, and the second National Assembly will be organized through a national general election in accordance with the constitution within six months. The reporter ended the interview there and then, as President Sun had other matters to attend to.

Based on the Common Program, the Whole Country Cooperates in Unison

Zhou Enlai

At the opening of the Political Consultative Conference on the 10th, Zhou Enlai, a member of the conference, said: Such a Political Consultative Conference is an innovation in the political history of China. Especially in the transitional period when the whole country is unanimously demanding a swift end to political tutelage and actively preparing for constitutional government, this conference bears a serious historical mission. Our delegation from the Chinese Communist Party, based on this understanding, is willing to work with the representatives of all parties and social figures with the utmost sincerity and tolerance to discuss national affairs and work together.

When the delegation came to the capital this time, it first proposed an unconditional cessation of the civil war. After more than 20 days of appeals and efforts, with the joint efforts of government representatives, and especially with the support of our ally General Marshall, and finally thanks to President Chiang's vision and empathy, the civil war, which the whole world and the whole of China are concerned about, was ordered to be stopped by both sides today.

The cessation of military conflict is necessary for a good discussion of political solutions, and the political solution is to realize the policy of peaceful national construction. The Kuomintang and the Communist Party have already recognized in the Double Tenth Agreement that they will cooperate in the long term on the basis of peace, democracy, unity, and under the leadership of President Chiang, firmly avoid civil war, and build an independent, free, and prosperous new China, and thoroughly realize the Three Principles of the People. Both sides also agreed that political democratization, nationalization of the military, and equality and legality of political parties are the necessary paths to achieving peaceful national construction. The Political Consultative Conference is to ask the representatives of all parties and social figures to work together to formulate a plan to achieve political democratization, nationalization of the military, and equality and legality of political parties. During this transitional period, we propose to realize a government of national unity in which representatives of all parties and non-party representatives cooperate on the basis of a common program. At this time, the rights of the people and the cooperation of political parties are the most urgent problems to be solved. Just now, we heard President Chiang's announcement on guaranteeing the four rights of the people, and we welcome this announcement and are willing to fight for the realization of these rights. With a situation of peace and unity and a foundation of democracy and unification, China can carry out genuine popular elections and democratic constitutionalism, and only then can there be genuine agricultural reform and industrial construction. We wish the Political Consultative Conference success.

The Urgent Task at Hand is to Complete Reconstruction and Relief

Shen Junru

At the opening of the Political Consultative Conference on the 10th, Shen Junru, a member of the conference, said: Today's opening of the Political Consultative Conference is not only a matter of concern to the people of the whole country, but also a matter of concern to people all over the world. First of all, on behalf of all the attending members of the China Democratic League, I would like to express our sincerity, frankness, impartiality, and selflessness to bear this great responsibility together with all the members. We believe that the current issues of reconstruction and relief are more urgent than the issues of drafting and implementing a constitution. We are willing to work with all the members to solve these problems first. Our China Democratic League emphasizes the following points in solving these problems: First, we must not violate the common aspirations of the people. Second, we must not betray the good intentions of our allies to help. Third, we must act with the utmost sincerity when implementing the plan and adhere to it with the utmost trust. Regarding the detailed methods for solving the above problems, we are willing to seek fair and reasonable results in the conference based on the principle of mutual concession.

Everyone Should Openly and Frankly Create a National Construction Line

Zeng Qi

At the Political Consultative Conference this morning, member Zeng Qi said: Today, at the opening of this conference, I would like to say a few words on behalf of my comrades in the China Youth Party. We hope to move to the stage of constitutional government through this and form a unified front for national construction, with the goal of becoming a modern country in name and in reality in thirty years. But to achieve this goal, we must have cooperation between the government and the opposition, with one heart and one mind, and work together in the same boat, using the spirit of "cooperating in the war of resistance" to cooperate in national construction. In particular, we must treat each other with sincerity. I want to put the country on the right track, and the only way to do this is to implement political democratization and nationalization of the military. In order to achieve this goal, we must all implement the sixteen characters of "openness and frankness, collective wisdom and benefit, examining facts according to names, and eliminating the turbid and promoting the pure." I would like to offer this to all the gentlemen at the conference. And I wish the conference a smooth success, fully achieving the goals of democracy, unity, peace, and national construction.

Willing to Use the Wheel as a Metaphor to Promote Its Forward Progress

Shao Congen

At the morning meeting of the Political Consultative Conference on the 10th, member Shao Congen said: Today, Congen is entrusted by the non-partisan and non-factional members to say a few words. Today is good, the front-line fighting has stopped, and both sides have shown patriotism. Based on this patriotism, we can have hope for the future of the country. We think about how this wrong path in the past could not be followed. Internally, it harmed the common people, and externally, our allies were worried for us, and our enemies were happy to see it. In the future, everyone must be "sincere" and "trustworthy." If one thing is on the inside and another on the outside, that is "insincerity." If it's one thing today and another tomorrow, that is "untrustworthiness." Secondly, all parties and factions must understand each other. There are political parties in foreign countries, and even many political parties, one of which must be conservative. Without a conservative political party, the foundation of the country will be shaken at any time. And there must be a progressive political party. Without a progressive political party, politics will degenerate day by day. These two kinds of political parties seem to be opposite, but they are complementary and mutually cause each other. They are like two wheels, going in the same direction, moving forward on a new road day by day. Looking back, China is also like this. The Kuomintang and the Communist Party are like pillars, and the other parties are like beams. But today our pillars and beams have not become a very complete system. From the bottom of my heart, Congen sees the country above and the people below, and based on these three, I offer my opinions to serve the country. (Applause)

Yamashita Tomoyuki, More Cunning Than a Monkey

Yamashita Tomoyuki was sentenced to death by the Allied military court, which was well deserved. But Yamashita did not completely repent, and he is still studying the verdict with his defense lawyer in the hope of reversing his death sentence. At the same time, 86,000 out-of-touch Tokyo citizens have launched a petition movement seeking to spare Yamashita's death sentence, which is also a futile effort. The San Francisco Chronicle made a satirical comment, saying: "The three monkeys who do not speak evil, hear evil, or see evil will give way to Yamashita Tomoyuki!" This remark is very incisive and pungent. The illustration shows Yamashita and his defense lawyer studying the verdict.

### A Record of a Walk in Pengcheng (Part 2)

— Shao Shenzhi

Xuzhou's establishment as a municipality is a new undertaking since Japan's surrender. The first mayor, Lu Dongfan, arrived in mid-December to take office and held his inauguration ceremony on the 28th. He told reporters that the Jiangsu Provincial Government is studying the city's planning. Xuzhou may become a more substantial ordinary city in the future, but currently, two-thirds of its financial revenue is used to pay the salaries of the city's administrative staff, with only one-third allocated for local construction. While this is better than some special municipalities that are in deficit, the proportions still need to be normalized.

Xuzhou is bitterly cold at the end of the year, with snow fluttering on New Year's Day. Soldiers and civilians wear thick and bulky cotton-padded clothing, leisurely strolling through the market. This demonstrates their resilience against nature. Meanwhile, impoverished old people, with purple hands and cheeks, hover on the icy, glass-like pedestrian paths, begging pitifully. This is the street scene of Xuzhou, the northern gateway. The frequency of Japanese people coming and going on the streets is even greater than in Nanjing and Shanghai. When asked, responsible authorities said that there are only about 8,000 Japanese residents now, but they can still set up shops and engage in small businesses.

The female owner of a Japanese cafe said, "This is because the Garrison Command pities us and allows us to operate." When mentioning the crimes committed by the Japanese invaders in China, she said, "We really cannot be held responsible." She then refused to continue the conversation to avoid this sensitive reality. The reporter was puzzled about the meaning of "pity." Is it a euphemism for tolerance or a different interpretation of indulgence?

According to the person in charge of the Japanese Prisoner Management Office: "The highest number of Japanese prisoners concentrated in Xuzhou was 17,405. Currently, there are 12,460 people waiting to be shipped back home. There are also 1,206 Japanese residents. Although no management agency was established for them, the management office is also responsible for them implicitly. 1,364 Japanese residents evacuated from the Bian-Zheng area towards the Jinpu Railway in the north. They turned back at Lincheng due to transportation issues and were also sent by the management office to Haizhou to board ships. Currently, the Japanese residents in Xuzhou are generally restricted to the area north of Qiming Road, east of Junyun Road, and south of the old Yellow River for residence."

These Japanese residents, apart from preparing to return to their country, their lifestyle does not seem to have changed much. Recently, they have been busy with the so-called repatriation organization. On December 26th, the preparatory committee for their new self-governing association held its second meeting. The preparatory committee includes 20 members, and the Consul General of Xuzhou was appointed as honorary chairman, signifying "integration of officials and civilians." One chairman (civilian), two vice-chairmen (one official and one civilian), were elected through voting on the 30th and announced on the 31st. A total of 50 officers were elected, but 5-6 of them were recommended by their government. Only men and women over the age of 20 have the right to vote. Their repatriation organization has been divided into seven groups and fourteen teams.

At the beginning of this year, the Japanese residents received unofficial orders urging them to practice "self-restraint." There are two points of attention: (1) Hanging the Japanese flag at the door on New Year's Day and holding year-end and New Year banquets are all prohibited; (2) Drunkenness in the streets and women wearing fancy clothes are prohibited. On New Year's Day, the reporter did not see any Japanese flags hanging at the residences of Japanese residents, nor did they hang the Chinese national flag. Although there were still drunken Japanese hooligans flirting with waitresses in Japanese cafes, the expressions of the general Japanese residents were particularly cold and gloomy, silently hurrying under the eaves, and their traces were rarely seen.

On New Year's Day, Xuzhou held a celebration with a large parade, military music, and decorations on the streets. A large V-shaped colored light, about ten feet high, was placed in the middle of the road, dazzlingly bright red. Xuzhou had a dance hall for the first time after the victory, located in a side room next to the National Assembly Hall. The space was less than 50 square meters, with broken horns and various dance tunes, extremely ear-splitting. There were only three dancers, but the dancers were very enthusiastic. Soldiers on leave gathered outside the door to watch, and then broke in and crowded into the hall without dispersing, silently and without smiling, witnessing this "miracle," almost causing conflict. This was also an interlude on New Year's Day.

The reporter was delayed in Xuzhou for five days due to the interruption of train transportation on the Pu-Xu section of the Jinpu Railway. Tomorrow, I may be able to take an engineering car to Nanjing. Xuzhou is currently launching a comfort campaign, and those responsible for organizing the campaign are ordering food from various places for air transport to the defending troops in Lincheng. The reporter dined twice at the New New Western Restaurant, and its baked bread was excellent. When asked about the reason, they said that they were baking a large amount, so it was always fresh. However, there is a ban on the military ordering civilian fuel from the Liuquan coal mine through connections, and since it is all used for road use, it is slightly difficult.

### A Message to Adventurers in Kunming: Your Fields Will Be Overgrown; Why Not Return Home? Speculative Activities in Zhan Yi City Are Coming to an End

By Our Kunming Special Correspondent Zhang Jun

On the lifeline of adventurers, Kunming and Zhanyi were once their paradises. Although the rise of these two paradises was separated by several years, the style and changes of the latter (Zhanyi) surpassed the former. Some people compare Kunming to Shanghai before the war and Zhanyi to an early American Western city, and there are indeed some similarities. Although most adventurers lost their paradise in Kunming and Zhanyi, some are still struggling here. As for those who have returned home, their future may be boundless. In the vast recovered areas, where can't a new paradise be rebuilt?

The Rise and Fall History of Paradise Unfolds Two Lines of Struggle

When talking about the rise and fall history of Kunming's paradise, one should not ignore the "struggle of two lines": one is the originally smooth but later obstructed Yunnan-Burma Road, and the other is the China-India air route flying over the Hump. The former was the golden age of drivers, and the latter was the golden age of brokers, speculators, and the "international route." The former caused the sudden rise of paradise, and the latter brought paradise to its peak. The decline of the two lines strangled the adventurers' lifeline. Some adventurers, having no place to use their skills, attacked the tombs. Tombs in the suburbs of Kunming are often robbed. In November and December of last year, there were over a hundred tomb robbery cases, especially female tombs. Alas, the dead cannot rest in peace in the earth, which is truly a tragedy. Thinking back to those years, brokers filled paradise, gambling houses, dance halls, and taverns. How many people spent money like dirt? Looking today, the doors are deserted, the number of unemployed has surged, and the sadness of adventure is even displayed on street stalls, which cannot help but make people laugh and cry!

Complex Adventurers: The Majority Are Large and Small Brokers

The so-called adventurers have the most complex components, and brokers are the majority. Most brokers in Kunming have no leaders and no organization, but they are related to trade associations. In terms of types, the largest brokers initially specialized in various American military businesses and later switched to contacting the Logistics Department and the Transportation Bureau. Small brokers, like mercury spilling on the ground, are ubiquitous, never sitting in one place for long, and use connections to enrich themselves. In terms of nature, there is a type of "empty-hearted young masters" who specialize in running errands. Another type is "upright people" who often obtain deposits through various transaction contracts to make profits. There are even more people who concurrently or exclusively engage in brokerage businesses by relying on their occupations, power, and social connections. It is estimated that before the victory, there were about 50,000 to 60,000 people in the above three categories. The goods that brokers traded were initially most profitable with gasoline. Later, due to government regulations on colors, transactions were restricted, but adventurers who were generally said to have backing made huge profits from this. The second was alcohol. Many people became rich in this industry, and most of the sources were private goods, with very few people starting factories to manufacture it themselves. Some people often rely on transferring contracts to make profits, and some people specialize in "running contracts." The people in this industry, in addition to having an adventurous spirit, must have some background in personnel matters. The third major category of goods is trafficking in firearms, drugs, and other contraband. There are also those who transport or pack contraband on behalf of others. Many disputes and bloody incidents often occur in this type of trade or transport.

Setting Up Homecoming Stalls: The Most Advanced Adventurers

Formal merchants and financial figures in Kunming generally failed or succeeded due to speculative adventures. Among commercial banks, those from the Jiangzhe region were the most stable, so they suffered no major losses before and after this victory. The banks from the Sichuan region, with weaker foundations, faced extremely difficult situations at the beginning of the victory. Local banks were better able to weather the difficulties because they could transfer funds to each other. Most of the giants of speculative adventure failed in gold, US dollars, and gauze. A mid-level employee of a certain bank originally had a capital of 20 million yuan, and then borrowed another 40 million yuan to purchase gold and foreign currency, and then mortgaged them for loans to hoard other goods. When the firecrackers of victory sounded, he was in debt of 80 million yuan. As a result, he could not afford to pay and ran to Chongqing to commit suicide. From August of the year before last to August of last year, it can be called the year of the frenzy of gold and foreign currency. Adventurers, formal merchants, semi-official and semi-commercial figures, and officials in disguise all concentrated on this line. As a result, they all suffered惨敗 and were in a state of disgrace. From August to October of last year, it was called the "month of relief appeals." Merchants and factories, through public opinion organs and newspapers, demanded emergency relief. A certain gold shop, holding 8,000 taels of gold savings certificates, was also calling out that it was terrible. Although ordinary citizens and civil servants suffered the same fate, they were relatively calm. After several years of hard work, once everything was lost, they sighed at their bad luck and set up a homecoming stall to earn some travel expenses. Such adventurers are the best of them.

Making a Deal: Immediately Becoming a Guest at the Gambling Table

When talking about the adventurers' paradise, one cannot ignore Kunming's gambling houses. Big and small gambling became commonplace, and those wagering millions of yuan were countless. One or two giants in the financial world had their futures ruined at the poker table. According to the reporter, there was a group of mid-level brokers who regularly gathered to gamble and take commissions, taking turns as hosts. The entertainment fee for one table of gamblers was often 300,000 to 400,000 yuan per night, and their commission income was around one million yuan. In the past year, the total amount of commissions they took in turns reached about 100 million yuan, from which one can see the rest. Friends who failed in the gambling house, as long as they made an adventurous or speculative deal, were immediately guests at the front of the gold-waving table again. However, these people must have their background there.

The Rise of Zhanyi City Began Last March

Kunming and Zhanyi can be called two mother-and-child cities in the activities of adventurers. This small child city of Zhanyi began to rise last March and declined with the victory against Japan. The city had originally been a small station of the southwest highway and the East Yunnan-Sichuan highway, and its position was far less than Qujing. It had suddenly become an important transportation hub for the Southwest region thanks to the extension of the Yunnan-Sichuan Railway to Zhanyi and the building of a large airfield. A large number of U.S. air forces and the expeditionary forces converged in the city, which boosted the formerly despondent and desolate marketplace. A new marketplace was built near the railway station in a short period of time. Most numerous were the bars, many of which hired hostesses to cater to the American soldiers. The second most numerous were the tea houses, which were always packed and which had become the headquarters for the brokers. Adventurers flocked to the city, competing to buy and sell gasoline, alcohol, foreign currencies, and other contraband. Arguments, fights, and murders often occurred at the teahouses and restaurants, either due to transaction disputes, failed extortion, or uneven distribution of loot. Gunshots were often heard in the rooms and on the streets. It was not uncommon to be startled several times a night. Most of the soldiers, merchants, hooligans, and gangsters who came and went carried guns for self-defense. Gangs took the opportunity to become active, recruiting a large number of cadres, and created a special force in the city. The local authorities could not restrain them either. Speculative merchants who wanted to operate there had to socialize with those people; otherwise, they would lose both their money and their people. Even the adventurers of Kunming felt a little headache about the abnormal development of this small city.

After the Two Cities Prospered, the Social Atmosphere Was Affected

Adventurers in Kunming and Zhanyi promoted the prosperity of the two cities and influenced the atmosphere of the two cities. In the past, those who pushed carts and peddled goods were vastly different between spring and autumn. Observing their haughtiness and popularity, honest and enthusiastic people often found it laughable, and people who were generally forced by the environment also unwittingly got involved in this adventurous and speculative fire waterfall. If this situation continued to develop, it was hard to imagine where it would lead. The sound of victory became the death knell of paradise, shattering the adventurers' spring dreams. The adventurers paled in comparison, 群嘆 that the victory came too quickly. Who said: People's hearts are like the sea, and desires are hard to fill. You can trust me on this. After the victory against Japan, some people were still struggling, and the phenomenon of a sudden burst of energy before death also occurred. It is not surprising. In short, today's Kunming is changing, and today's Zhanyi is gradually becoming calm. Although the development of the two cities is difficult to predict, the paradise of the past may not reappear. Adventurers, the vast recovered areas need your kind of spirit to develop. Your fields have been overgrown; why not return home?

Editorial

### A Powerful Guarantee of Peace and Happiness

Yesterday, the Political Consultative Conference opened, and both the central government and the Communist Party issued orders to cease conflict. These two great pieces of good news not only brought smiles to the faces of the Chinese people but also were welcomed by people around the world who care about the Chinese political situation. The American public even said that the brightest vision in the world today is focused on China. The price of Chinese public bonds in the London market also rose as a result. The Chinese people today have such wise leaders, such a tolerant government, and such parties that can abandon their prejudices and work together harmoniously. The Chinese people are indeed excited and glorious, and they feel that the future is bright and unlimited. Although in the five months since the Japanese surrendered, we were extremely ashamed of the unfortunate internal strife, but yesterday, as if a straw hat were lifted, the clouds were swept away, and a heavy stone was lifted from everyone's hearts. The peace and happiness that the people of the whole country should have enjoyed after a hundred years of humiliation and eight years of bloody battles also had a dawn from then on.

After reading the opening speech of Chairman Chiang at the Consultative Conference and the speeches of the members, we not only felt that peace and happiness had dawned, but also believed that peace and happiness had indeed obtained a strong guarantee. The reason is very simple: to enable the people to enjoy peace and happiness, we must first respect the people's proper status and legitimate rights, and the respect for the people's status and rights depends on the fact that the parties participating in political activities can truly have a democratic spirit. From the situation after the opening of this Consultative Conference, it can be said that the government and all parties can generally experience this point and have the determination to cultivate the democratic spirit necessary for engaging in modern politics. Therefore, what we think is gratifying today is secondary to the issuance of the ceasefire order, and what is most commendable is that political figures from all sides have the determination to develop that democratic spirit. With a democratic spirit among politicians, the people can truly obtain a guarantee of peace and happiness.

From what place do we see that people from all sides seem to have a democratic spirit?

First of all, we cannot but praise the greatness of Chairman Chiang's leadership spirit. When the meeting of the three-person group became almost a stalemate, he generously agreed to revise his original proposal, so that the "ceasefire" order could be happily issued yesterday morning before the opening of the Consultative Conference.

Chairman Chiang said in his opening speech, "In order to form effective resolutions, sometimes eliminating our proposals is of greater value than insisting on our opinions." He himself was the first to practice these bright and upright words. Not only that, but he also repeatedly said that he wanted to be sincere and frank, selfless and impartial, and to have a broad and long-term vision, and what he never forgot was "the most urgent demands of our people today." In order to realize the people's minimum requirements, the requirements for stability and restoration, the requirements for living and working in peace and contentment, and the requirements for peaceful unification, he believes that the government "only has a sense of responsibility and obligation and has no selfish or gainful views." Therefore, he hopes that this meeting "can always maintain understanding and harmony," and his resolute order to stop the conflict before the opening of the meeting is indeed the most obvious symbol of this understanding and harmony. What is especially worth praising is that Chairman Chiang formally announced the four measures decided by the government to protect the people's rights before the meeting was discussed, so that "the freedom of the people," "the legal status of political parties," "the universal suffrage from the bottom up," and "the release of political prisoners" can be seen in facts from now on. We used to always say that the politics of the Three People's Principles must be politics that take the road of democracy. Today, thanks to the appeal of Chairman Chiang's great spirit, we believe even more that the democratic spirit inherently possessed by the Kuomintang will be carried forward and enhanced day by day. What we hope is that the heads of all responsible departments of the government and responsible personnel at all levels will appreciate the democratic spirit of the chairman and immediately do their best in their duties to realize these four measures. Only by showing in fact that these four measures have achieved practical results can it be said that China has taken a big step on the road to democracy.

Secondly, the speech of the Communist Party representative Zhou Enlai was vastly different from the telegram of General Zhu De in the early days of the Japanese surrender. In the eyes of General Zhu De at that time, how could there be a national government? How could he be concerned about the Chinese people? Today, the Communist Party representatives can praise "Chairman Chiang's foresight and determination" and can care about "the suffering of the people." It is indeed progress, and it can also be said that they have some democratic spirit. And what is most moving is that the Communist Party representatives today already know that only by "trusting the people and relying on the people" and hoping that all members "will be responsible to the people and responsible to the country" are they willing "to tolerate to the greatest extent" and discuss state affairs with all parties. A political party can originally have political opinions, but it should not be prejudiced in its "own opinions." And political parties in democratic countries especially need the opposition party to learn from each other to achieve mutual promotion. As long as each political party can slightly eliminate the self-righteousness of its own opinions and think of the people and the country at all times, then democratic etiquette such as criticism, blame, understanding, and tolerance between parties will naturally be achieved without expectation. What had the Communist army done for five months by fighting for land after the Japanese surrender? "The suffering of the people" has deepened! The appeals of the people have almost become hoarse. Fortunately, today, the Communist Party has awakened and is willing to "under the guidance of the martyrs and in front of the portrait of Mr. Sun Yat-sen," to swear next time, "never to let China have another civil war." This is truly a thorough realization after understanding! We do not hope that there is no criticism or blame between political parties, nor do we dare to say that political parties are only allowed to understand and tolerate. But no matter whether it is criticism and blame or understanding and tolerance, one cannot leave the parliament and step onto the battlefield. We believe that the Communist Party's democratic spirit of abandoning the battlefield and re-entering the parliament can indeed change the Communist Party's style forever in the future. We also believe that the Communist Party will be able to understand the true desires and urgent demands of the people in the future and will not be confined by the "own opinions" of the Communist Party alone. A party must never think that the opinions of my party are the opinions of the people, and the propositions of my party are the propositions of the people. As Chairman Chiang said, "Before the implementation of constitutional government, the people's true will has not yet had a way to be fully expressed." Indeed, only with such a spirit of modesty can everyone often experience the will of the people and take care of the people's happiness when discussing state affairs together.

Finally, I would like to say a word to the participants of the Political Consultative Conference: This conference is a landmark meeting in history. Although you are not elected by the people, you must never forget the people at all times! Millions of people are watching the progress of the meeting! You have been hired by the National Government to discuss state affairs together, and your acceptance and reform are related to the great plans of the country, so tolerance is acceptable, but perfunctoriness is not, understanding is acceptable, but accommodation is not. You should overcome any difficulties and not shake the foundation of the country in the slightest. You must understand that although the members of the Political Consultative Conference are not representatives of the people, the Consultative Conference is not an institution for exercising national sovereignty, and since you have participated, you should act according to your conscience and "be responsible to the people and responsible to the country." If you can take this responsibility, the people's peace and happiness can be more firmly guaranteed by your joint efforts.

### Gold Prices Slightly Lower Than Previous Closing; US Dollar Plummets Sharply in Afternoon Trading; Rumors Spread That US Dollars Cannot Be Used for Settlements

Spot gold, after a weak initial surge yesterday, continued to languish, unable to escape its constrained trajectory. Though market prices were ostensibly cheaper than the publicly quoted prices for securities, they were strangled by listed prices, making any unusual gains difficult. Various parties were eager to test the waters, but most remained in a wait-and-see posture.

Early in the morning, prices rose to 8,430,000 due to positive reports from the wartime capital market, with some paper industry firms adding to their positions. However, this upward activity was short-lived. Northern merchants slightly eased their holdings at higher prices, and the upward momentum was swiftly checked. Short-selling and profit-taking emerged simultaneously, and by midday, prices were again pressured down to 8,240,000. The afternoon initially showed stability, hovering around 8,350,000. However, unexpectedly, rumors emerged that US dollars could not be used for settlements. This sparked widespread speculation unfavorable to the US dollar, causing a significant weakening of the dollar, which in turn affected the gold market.

Eventually, prices settled around 8,250,000, resulting in a slight drop of 1,000 compared to the previous closing. Gold jewelry was listed at 89,000 per unit, fine silver at 700 yuan, and silver dollars fluctuated around 460. The black market exchange rate remained sluggish, with interest rates ranging from approximately 8 to 10 percent.

The US dollar showed relative stability yesterday morning, moving in tandem with the gold market. Currency exchange businesses actively reduced their holdings, causing the exchange rate to fall from around 1445 yuan. By midday, it was fluctuating around 1430 yuan. The afternoon initially remained stable, but after 2:30 PM, rumors suddenly spread that US dollars could not be used for settlement, causing the rate to plummet to 1400 yuan. This was followed by further rumors of a ban on foreign currency exports and a new exchange rate fixed at 1365 yuan, leading to a breach of the 1400 yuan level and a retreat to around 1380 yuan. The closing price was 35 yuan lower than the previous close, and this was still the selling price.

### Type C Shares Continue to Rise; Chinese Stocks Experience Another Frenzied Surge; Foreign Stocks Show Steady and Strong Performance

Publicly quoted Type C shares opened yesterday, rising to 1260 yuan due to the issued ceasefire order between the Nationalists and Communists, coupled with rumors of an imminent resumption of securities trading. Short sellers rushed to cover their positions, further exciting buyers, and prices climbed to around 1350 yuan. Later, with a slight market correction, Type C shares hovered around the 1300 yuan mark at midday. The final result was an increase of 100 yuan for Type C shares compared to the previous closing, while Type A and B shares fell by 50 yuan, Type D shares by 30 yuan, and Type E shares by 10 yuan. This reflects the time sensitivity, where miscellaneous and popular stocks cannot move in unison.

The Chinese stock market was chaotic yesterday. Paper industry stocks were actively sold at higher prices, transitioning from strong to weak. Retail investors engaged in widespread short-selling. Yong Yarn declined from 1140 yuan to 1060 yuan, Meyer from 840 yuan to 770 yuan, and New Light from 66 yuan to below 62 yuan. Major players manipulated the market, leaving retail investors bewildered.

The situation stabilized somewhat near midday, but unexpectedly, in the afternoon, tea firms dumped large quantities of Xinhe Yarn Factory shares, unable to deliver the goods, and proposed settling the contracts in cash. This triggered a massive buying frenzy. Although the trades were limited due to the late hour, the bidding soared wildly amidst the chaos. Yong Yarn briefly jumped above 1250 yuan, Meyer above 900 yuan, and the "Three Small Hot Stocks" were also stimulated, surging by about 10%. Afterward, there was a slight correction. Ultimately, amid calls for promoting production and resuming securities trading, Yong Yarn and Meyer each rose by 130 yuan, the "Three Small Hot Stocks" gained 10%, and even less popular stocks followed suit to a considerable extent. The speculative atmosphere was intense, reaching a boiling point. Things must decay from within before insects breed. Beware of unexpected shocks.

Foreign stocks continued their upward trend, showing a remarkably steady performance, unlike the arbitrary swings of Chinese stocks. Benefiting from the positive environment, most stocks generally increased by another 5% to 10%.

### Amid Calls to Suppress Prices, Grain Prices Continue to Rise

China Merchants Bureau Ships Rice from Wuhu

Demand for rice and grains in Tianjin and Qingdao remained strong. Early Indica rice continued to rise by 700-800 yuan, Northern Japonica rice also rose by 400-500 yuan, and Indica rice also increased by 300-500 yuan. Bai Yuan, Yin Yuan, and Beiyang silver dollars also attracted inquiries, leading to a further increase of 500 yuan. Yellow soybeans from Minhua revived, recovering from weakness and gaining 200-300 yuan. The oil market fluctuated wildly, but today, due to increased digestion, it rose by 300-500 yuan. The flour market remained firm, but demand weakened, leading to a stagnant trend. Soybean cakes, with full shipping berths from Nanyang, saw a decline in demand from holders, causing prices to fall by a small hundred yuan or so. The liquor market was unremarkable, while raw peanuts remained firm, similar to sesame.

[Report from this Newspaper] A large quantity of Wuhu rice has arrived in port. This week, over 8,000 bags have arrived, transported by iron barges towed by China Merchants Bureau's Guotai, Guoding, Feibo, Feitian, and Feimin ships. It is reported that a larger quantity is awaiting shipment, so the Bureau has dispatched the Jiangxin ship today to Wuhu for loading. This rice is being transported on behalf of the Food Storage and Transportation Office. Additionally, 23,000 bags of flour are being transported to Hong Kong by the Yuezhou ship as relief supplies.

### No Prospects for Warehouse Deliveries; Rayon Shows Its Sharp Edge; Factory Prices Show Slight Improvement

The silk market, which had been weak for days, suddenly rebounded yesterday. Rayon showed its edge from the start. No. 120 Tianqiao was at 850,000 yuan, and amid a chorus of buyers, it quickly rose to 900,000 yuan. In the afternoon, it continued to trade at 910,000 yuan. Warehouse receipts were at 715,000 yuan, 80,000-90,000 yuan higher than the previous day. The reason for the rise is that there are no prospects for the delivery of silk stored in warehouses, leading to hoarding of spot goods and making it difficult to suppress market prices. Factory prices showed slight activity, with a small improvement in prices. The silk market initially showed no improvement, but was then uniformly raised due to the sharp rise in raw materials. Meyer quilt covers were at 580,000 yuan per 100, and Minsheng brocade成交价 was at 9,000 yuan per piece.

### Yarn Prices Can't Be Suppressed; Coarse and Fine Yarn Continue to Rise

The yarn market rose again yesterday, due to a steady stream of customers coming to purchase. Customers from Nanjing and other places were particularly interested in smaller yarn factories with lower prices and clean colors. Transactions between peers were also quite active. Based on 16-count Guangming yarn, 20-count and 16-count yarn rose by about 30,000 yuan compared to yesterday, and fine yarn rose by about 60,000-70,000 yuan.

### Optimistic Outlook for the Tea Market

European and American Demand for Chinese Tea is Very Strong

Russia Has Been in Contact with Tea Merchants

[Report from this Newspaper] The overseas sales of Chinese tea from this city are currently suspended due to the incomplete resumption of maritime transport and the authorities' failure to announce foreign exchange rates. According to reliable information obtained by reporters from relevant industry personnel, demand for Chinese tea is strong in European and American countries. It is also rumored that the Russian government may abandon its monopoly, and there is momentum to start trading. They are currently in contact with a tea merchant in this city. However, since the tea production season has passed, there is likely to be no significant development until the new tea season next spring.

The tea market yesterday was still most strongly driven by demand from Tianjin, and sales from local shops were also quite good, so confidence continued to be optimistic, and prices remained quite firm.

### Bituminous Coal Sales Active

Sales of bituminous coal lumps have become healthier, especially with general speculative shops eagerly purchasing embankment lumps, causing the market to turn firm and strong. Bituminous coal dust followed suit and became active. Although the market price of anthracite coal remained stable, sales were not as smooth as before due to the continuous arrival of goods. The quality of the coal that arrived in this city was better than previous batches, and although the market atmosphere was weak, asking prices were high.

### Turnaround for Black Iron Billets

It was previously reported that 2,000-pound black iron billets had arrived from abroad, causing panic and prices to plummet. In half a month, the price dropped by more than two-thirds. At the beginning of this month, some were even selling them for 300,000 yuan each. Recently, there has been a slight turnaround, as the feeling of terror has gradually faded and new orders from abroad require more than 400,000 yuan. Therefore, spot goods are currently being offered at around 500,000 yuan.

### Shortage of No. 12 Lead Wire

A buyer is currently asking brokers to purchase approximately 400-500 dan of No. 12 soft lead wire. However, the market supply of this type of lead wire is very scarce, so those who hold the goods are waiting for a good price before selling.

### Paper Prices Stabilize; Hoarders Sell to Obtain Cash

The upward trend in foreign paper prices is gradually stabilizing. Due to the recent price increases, sellers believe they can sell their holdings, leading to a balance between supply and demand. Yesterday, it was reported that foreign exchange rates will soon be set, based on commodity prices. Paper merchants generally believe that this standard will consider both imports and exports. The current paper prices are several times higher than pre-war levels. If the exchange rate is set, the so-called standard based on commodity prices cannot be based on current paper prices. Therefore, there will inevitably be a large drop in the future, so there is a tendency to sell to obtain cash. However, due to thin inventories, there is no large-scale release of goods, so the market is still stabilizing within a range.

### Printing Industry Resumes Operations; Orders Machines from the United States

[Report from this Newspaper] Many printing businesses were suspended during the war. Rubber printing machines were taken away or seized by the enemy puppets, and stone printing machines (which are no longer very useful) were automatically dismantled and sold as scrap metal. Now that the war has been won and restoration is underway, trademark designs for dyeing and weaving industries, as well as cigarette paper packaging for cigarette factories, all require printing. There is a great need, but few businesses in the industry can resume printing. It is reported that they are actively ordering the latest machines from the United States to make up for the shortage.

### Dynamics of Trade Associations

The West Paint Industry Association has been ordered to merge with the Domestic Paint Industry Association, and Zhang Zhenhou has been appointed as a standing committee member responsible for convening the meeting.

Yu Zhijing, the restructuring committee member of the Knitting Industry, has resigned and his resignation has been approved.

Chemical raw material manufacturers have requested to form an association, and they have been ordered to merge into the Chemical Raw Material Industry, and Wu Jichun, Chen Ruixiang, and Hong Zuliang have been appointed as restructuring committee members. Fu Renzhi, the restructuring committee member of the Paraffin Wax Industry Association, has passed away, and Yang Guangshi has been appointed to fill the vacancy.

A silk textile factory industry association has been established, and Xu Ligeng and two others have been appointed as organizing members.

Chen Chongyu, manager of Sanxing Ink Factory, and others have requested to form an ink industry association, and preparations have been approved.

Zhang Fengshou, Zhou Baozhi, Qian Boyan, Zhu Jianping, and Xia Peiji have been appointed as restructuring committee members of the Inland River Shipping Industry Association.

The local scrap metal industry plans to organize an association. It has been ordered to merge with the steel bar and scrap iron industry. However, the former's main business is steel bars, foreign yuan, foreign squares, and foreign plates imported from Europe and the United States, which are used for construction and machinery manufacturing, while the latter is broken metal used for making agricultural tools. Due to their different natures, approval has been granted for them to organize separately.

Five people, including Chu Xianfa, have been appointed as organizing members for the Hardware Factory Industry Association.

Seven people, including Yao Xinghuang, have been appointed as organizing members for the Dairy Industry Association.

Ge Xianzong and others have been recommended as organizing members for the private ferry industry and their recommendation has been approved.

### Commercial News Summary

After the arrival of new Longkou vermicelli, it coincided with the start of winter sales. Demand from Guangdong merchants was very strong, so the market has risen to a new high.

The supply of dried lily flowers is sporadic, but demand is not weak, so the price increase is very strong. Yesterday, the best goods with good color were offered at a tighter price.

Due to purchases by Hong Kong merchants, persimmon cakes rose again, followed by melon seeds. Black dates rose again, and red dates were short, with prices opening higher than the previous listing. Only mid-range peach meat was available, and prices were raised accordingly.

There is a shortage of both 45 white sugar and the factory's white spot goods. With strong demand from customers, the market rose sharply again.

Cotton cloth was previously affected by the sale of yarn and cloth by the China Textile Construction Company, and the market was slightly weak, but its price was not much lower than the market price, and it could only be picked up after ten days, so the factory quickly returned to its former state.

Hangzhou silk crepe is frequently purchased by Hangzhou merchants. Traders believe that there is a shortage of goods, so they are supporting prices, and the trend is tight.

### International Economic Briefs

The US Export-Import Bank will soon lend China £825,000,000 to purchase 3,000 bales of US cotton.

The first Soviet ship to sail from the Black Sea to the Indian Ocean after the war is the Mitsulin steamship, which is currently en route to Calcutta.

The World Cotton Conference will be held in the United States in early April to determine international cotton standards.

The Japanese Ministry of Finance is rushing to print new 1,000-yen and 500-yen notes to be circulated in the market in April.

Excess Liquidity in the Market; Hong Kong Notes Rise Sharply; Target Set for Old Notes at Half Price; Guangdong Merchants Take the Opportunity to Sell Heavily

Old Hong Kong notes have no speculative value and are constrained by low prices in Hong Kong. As a result, they fell by 5 yuan. New notes are entirely manipulated by securities firms, gradually rising from around 75 yuan. In the afternoon, they were bid up to above 90 yuan. Finally, affected by the ban on foreign currency exports and other factors, they fell back to around 85 yuan. The result was still a gain of 11 yuan compared to the previous closing, but this was the selling price. Guangdong merchants sold out all their holdings throughout the day. There is a shortage of notes with a serial number starting with 36. The chips for 37 are looser. Major players called for higher prices, and the excess liquidity had no other outlet, concentrating on one sector. The initial target of the manipulators is half price for old notes, a price of 120 yuan. It is reported that current prices in Hong Kong are much lower than those in Shanghai. The massive selling by Guangdong merchants today is for this reason. The grand performance by speculators is truly breathtaking.

### National Lin University in the Capital Resumed Classes Yesterday; Student Representatives Went to Professors' Residences to Urge Them to Stay; They Also Visited Director Wang in the Hospital to Express Sympathy

[Express Telegram from This Newspaper in Nanjing] Nine students, including Yu Baiqing, who caused trouble at Lin University, were interrogated by the court yesterday. Eight were held in the Model Prison, and one was released on bail. When Yu and others were detained, six female students went to the Municipal Government to ask Mayor Ma for leniency and to request the court to release them, but were unsuccessful. Whether the case will be prosecuted by the court or by the victim, Wang Shulin, through a private prosecution, will depend on the results of the prosecutor's investigation. Lin University resumed classes this morning. The former puppet Central Student Self-Government Association has been dissolved informally, and student emotions have calmed down. Generally, it is observed that the student unrest was caused by students violating the law. Now that the students involved are aware of the sanctity of the law, they respectfully accept the constraints of the law with a child's heart. It is possible to arrive at the conclusion that "violations of the law cannot be excused, and it is greatly to be lamented that young students are far from the law," and to obtain a lenient sentence. This is an evil tide in the vast sea of learning after the recovery. Due to student awareness and the sanctity of the law, the prompt resolution of the case will become the starting point for an improvement in the academic atmosphere.

[Special Report from This Newspaper in Nanjing] Some students caused trouble at National Lin University in the capital, resulting in injuries to the director of the class, Wang Shulin, which caused indignation among the professors, who all submitted their resignations.

Students Posted Slogans Welcoming Director Wang

The majority of students, influenced by this, abandoned their studies and expressed appeals in writing, fully posting slogans such as "Welcome Director Huang of the Ministry of Education to come to the class to supervise!" "Welcome Director Wang to come to the class to preside!" "Please ask the professors to withdraw their resignations and resume classes as soon as possible!" "Students uphold justice and overthrow the minority of corrupt elements!" In addition to sending Director Huang Rujin of the Ministry of Education to the class for supervision, the Ministry of Education announced on the 9th the expulsion of 14 students who were the ringleaders of the trouble: Yu Baiqing, Li Shutang, Yao Dajun, Sun Di, Ding Jincheng, Ouyang Zhen, Yang Shihou, Yan Jiqing, Wang Dingshi, Zhao Zhongkai, Zuo Yuanliang, Qu Qilin, Yi Zhen, and Sheng Chuanxian.

The District Court Prosecutor's Office Detained Eight Students

The District Court Prosecutor's Office in the capital determined that the students had committed a criminal offense by gathering to assault Director Wang and scheduled a preliminary hearing at the court on the morning of the 10th, detaining nine students involved in the trouble. After the prosecutor's initial investigation, eight students were detained and one was released on bail. It is heard that a public prosecution will be filed, and they will be subject to legal punishment. Several students had tears in their eyes, regretting it too late. Director Huang Rujin of the Ministry of Education also arrived at the class on the morning of the 10th and convened a speech to all the students in the Lin University remedial class. The Dean of Studies, Wu Zhaotang, represented Director Wang as chairman, gave a speech to the students, and then invited Director Huang Rujin to give a speech.

Director Huang Rujin of the Ministry of Education Addressed the Students

Director Huang briefly described the proceedings of the post-recovery resettlement conference convened by the Ministry of Education last September, and the purpose of establishing the Lin University remedial class was to transform the thinking of young people, guide them into the right track, and supplement their knowledge so that students in puppet schools could enter regular universities through this bridge to complete their studies. Director Wang recruited many famous professors, who came to Beijing from thousands of miles away to teach, all to fulfill the important mission of revitalizing national culture and completing their educational responsibilities. Now, a few students have acted improperly and assaulted Director Wang. This unfortunate incident is, of course, the action of a few people. I have previously come to the class to inspect and seen that most students, although they have not attended classes, have been able to maintain order, take notes, and study on their own. Now the government, in order to rectify the academic atmosphere, sacrifices a few people [still announced in the name of Director Wang, according to the order of the Ministry of Education, expelling 14 students] in order to protect the studies of the majority of students. If another unfortunate incident occurs, it will inevitably lead to dissolution, and the students will permanently lose their education.

Teachers and Students Jointly Decided to Start Classes on the 11th

Subsequently, all the students present selected representatives Lin Weiqing and two others to earnestly request Director Huang to lead them to the hospital where Director Wang Shulin was located and to the residences of the professors to express sympathy and urge them to stay. At the same time, they jointly decided to resume classes on the 11th. When expressing sympathy and urging Director Wang and the professors to stay, they specifically pointed out that classes could definitely be started on the 11th. (Stupid)

### Jiangxi Province's Education Restoration Funds: The Finance Department Will Advance 5 Million Yuan First

[Report from Xinhua News Agency in Nanchang] Since the restoration of education in Jiangxi Province, many school buildings of provincial schools and community education institutions have been destroyed or damaged and need to be repaired or rebuilt, but funds are not available. Therefore, the then-acting Director of the Finance Department, Shi Wei, submitted a proposal to the Provincial Affairs Meeting, which was passed, and a telegram was sent to the Central Government requesting the allocation of education restoration and construction funds. However, the need is urgent and slow solutions will not help. Therefore, emergency measures were drafted again. In addition to urging the Central Government to approve the allocation as soon as possible, before the allocation arrives, the Finance Department will temporarily advance 5 million yuan from the emergency measures fund to meet the urgent need.

### Offices Established in Provinces and Cities Nationwide to Guide Youth Back to School

The candidates for the heads of various regions have been mostly finalized, including Liu Shaozhong in Beijing, Wu Maosun in Shanghai, Min in Beiping, Zhu Yuancheng in Wuhan, and Xu Ergong in Guangzhou. Once all the personnel arrangements are completed, the youth guidance offices in various regions can be officially established. Due to the unclear educational situation in the Nine Eastern Provinces, offices will not be established there for the time being, and separate plans will be formulated. In addition, Mr. Gan Jiaxin, Deputy Director of the Committee, will return to Chongqing from the Beijing-Shanghai area and will then travel to the Tianjin-Beijing area for inspections and to address the placement and measures for youth returning to school and employment.

### Football League Group A: Italian Overseas Chinese vs. Korean Overseas Chinese at the Rubber Garden Starting at 2:30 PM

There are three football league matches today, one each in Groups A, B, and C, to be held at Jiaozhou Park and Hongkou Park. Among them, the Group A match featuring the Italian Overseas Chinese team is sure to attract the interest of football fans. The team forfeited its first match against the British Navy, which aroused widespread attention. It has been learned that at that time, the team lacked leadership, and the players' jerseys and shoes were not in place, making it difficult to form a team. Now, Qu Yaokang, an enthusiastic figure in the sports world, has come forward to take charge. Therefore, the team will be able to appear in full new attire today, and their long-awaited football skills will allow fans to see them again. The Korean Overseas Chinese team forced a draw in their first match against Hequn, and their recent form is still good.

### Save the Children Who Are About to Drop Out of School: A Tuition Fee Issue Worthy of Attention at Present. Please Refer to the Tuition Fee Standards Set by the Municipal Bureau of Education.

Dear Editor,

A few days ago, your newspaper reported that the adjustment of tuition fees for this spring semester has been decided, approximately 12,000 yuan for primary school and 16,000 yuan for middle school. This shocking number is simply appalling! Last summer's middle school (private) tuition fees, calculated in legal tender, amounted to hundreds of thousands of yuan, which was already a cry of hardship. Currently, rice prices remain the same, but tuition fees have increased so much that "universal education" has become "increased dropout rates"! If a family has two children, the tuition fees alone would be unbearable. Nowadays, it is common for every small clerk to earn three to five thousand yuan per month. If they have two children at home, there will be no living expenses left after paying tuition fees. If everyone has to find a way to get student loans to attend school, can education still be universal? Therefore, I would like to borrow a corner of your newspaper to appeal: Can the education authorities revise the tuition fees again, thinking for the masses and reducing tuition fees? I am also a person with children. If tuition fees increase like this, I really cannot afford it and will have to let my children drop out of school because I am just a small clerk in a dry goods store and do not have a large income. But there are countless people in Shanghai who are in my situation. Please save our children who are about to drop out of school!

Sincerely,

You Dongsheng

Editor's Note: The tuition fee standards for private middle and primary schools in this city for the second semester of the 34th year of the Republic of China were submitted by the Municipal Bureau of Education and resolved by the 16th Municipal Conference yesterday (the 11th) as follows:

The tuition fees for private middle and primary schools in the second semester of the 34th year of the Republic of China should be charged according to the following regulations: 6,000 yuan per student per semester for primary school students in urban areas, 9,000 yuan per student per semester for junior high school students in urban areas, and 12,000 yuan per student per semester for senior high school students in urban areas; 4,000 yuan per student per semester for primary school students in suburban areas, 6,000 yuan per student per semester for junior high school students in suburban areas, and 9,000 yuan per student per semester for senior high school students in suburban areas. The above amounts are the maximum amounts. Fees for books, sports, etc., should be submitted by each school to the Municipal Bureau of Education for approval. The tuition fee standards set by the Municipal Bureau of Education are much lower than those mentioned in Mr. You's letter.

### The Task of the Labor Center Station

— Lu Erqiang

Promoting Labor Education Throughout Shanghai

As early as ten years ago, the government, realizing that educational facilities could not meet the actual lives of the people, stipulated in the promulgated educational implementation measures that "labor," "production," and "practicality" should be the core of education at all levels, making "hand training" as important as "brain training," in order to cultivate the spirit of hard work and endurance among the people and enhance the skills of national production. The Ministry of Education actively paid attention to the establishment of labor courses in middle and primary schools, and in November of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, it held the "National Exhibition of Labor Achievements of Vocational Schools and Middle and Primary Schools" in the capital, proving that labor training in middle and primary schools has practical value and can reflect the unity of school work and social production. From this, we can clearly see that as early as ten years ago, the education authorities had already paid attention to labor training and had cultivated a good foundation.

Unfortunately, after the July 7th Incident, the Japanese invaders attacked, and the War of Resistance broke out. Educational undertakings in the occupied areas suffered from enemy puppet destruction and have been in a state of decline for the past eight years. Now that the War of Resistance has been won and the sun has reappeared, Chairman Chiang has repeatedly declared that educational revival is an urgent task for national reconstruction. In his book "China's Destiny," he listed the talent needed for the first ten years of implementing the industrial plan as approximately 2.5 million graduates from schools at all levels. From this, it can be seen that national revival cannot be achieved without active construction; active construction cannot be achieved without practical talents; and cultivating practical talents cannot be achieved without an educational foundation that emphasizes both hands and brain.

Shanghai's educational undertakings have always been the center of gravity in the country, and the number of middle and primary schools is the highest in the country. Now that the concessions have been abolished and educational administration is unified, the municipal education authorities are all senior engineers, admiring the government's emphasis on the revival of Shanghai's education and even more on the active cultivation of practical education. In the future, the facilities of middle and primary schools in this city will surely restore labor as one of the important subjects. However, in reality, schools may be limited by finances or ignorant of the trend, and the labor subjects and application equipment are inevitably neglected and simple. In order to remedy this, it is imperative that the municipal education authorities lead and preside over it. The Municipal Labor Center Station, sponsored by the Department of Social Education of the Municipal Bureau of Education, is currently being actively prepared with the aim of promoting labor education. Various regulations that have been formulated will be implemented starting next semester, so that the city's labor education can be brought onto the right track, in line with the needs of national construction and the purpose of unifying education and production, and gradually lead the country to prosperity and strength. Excerpts of the station's implementation guidelines are as follows:

(1) Establish several practical workshops such as metalworking, woodworking, clay work, bamboo work, and rattan work. All public and private middle and primary schools in the city that have not followed the labor curriculum standards promulgated by the Ministry (according to the inspection report of the Supervision Department of the Municipal Bureau of Education) will be scheduled to notify the teachers of the school to lead the students to the station for practice.

(2) Hold vacation refresher courses for labor teachers to improve the teaching staff.

(3) Hold a city-wide middle and primary school labor exhibition to promote the public's understanding of the relationship between labor and industry.

(4) Select and sell the best student labor products for charity, to be used as funds to promote labor education, in order to achieve the unity of education and production.

(5) Establish an inspection committee to supervise all middle and primary schools in the city to comply with the labor curriculum standards promulgated by the Ministry.

(6) Establish an editorial committee to compile new teaching materials for printing by various bookstores and for use as reference by labor teachers.

### Disposal of Properties of Traitors After Judgment: Assets of Japanese Nationals Must Be Handed Over. Liu Gongyun Answered Questions from Reporters Yesterday.

(Report from this newspaper) Peng Xuepei, Chairman of the Shanghai District Review Committee for the Disposal of Enemy and Puppet Property, and Liu Gongyun, Director of the Disposal Bureau, held a tea party at the meeting room of the China Bank Building on Renji Road at 4:30 PM yesterday to entertain news reporters. More than 60 reporters from various newspapers and news agencies attended. Peng and Liu, as well as the heads of various groups of the Disposal Bureau, were also present on time. First, Peng Xuepei reported on the progress of the bureau's disposal work (full text recorded separately). Then, Liu Gongyun answered various questions raised by the press.

Open Bidding for Factories for Three Days

Director Liu continued, "Before the establishment of the Disposal Bureau, other agencies had already taken over various properties. Therefore, after the establishment of the Bureau, the main task was to adjust these. Currently, the Party and Government Takeover Committee has been disbanded, and the Real Estate Takeover Committee has been reorganized into the Bureau's Real Estate Group, whose main task is to review and return real estate owned by Allied nationals. The property previously taken over by the German Overseas Chinese Management Office has been transferred to the Bureau's Fourth Group. The Third Front Army's Military Supplies Takeover Committee has also come to an end, and the military supplies it has taken over will be handed over to the Ministry of Military Affairs." Liu then answered various questions raised by the reporters one by one. The main ones were: (1) The newspapers stored in various warehouses have been distributed to various newspapers in four batches. Recently, President Song has telegraphed Chief Chen in Taiwan, requesting that newspapers be shipped to Shanghai before the Lunar New Year to meet the urgent need. (2) The most difficult thing for the Bureau is the distribution of automobiles. Before the establishment of the Bureau, enemy and puppet vehicles had been taken over by various parties, making it extremely difficult to investigate. (3) There are not many water heaters in the Bureau's custody, and the supply-demand ratio is ten to one. Therefore, it is impossible to fully meet the needs of applicants. At most, the water heaters only have license plates, making it extremely difficult to prove ownership. Therefore, some applicants have accepted compensation and are willing to sacrifice the water heaters. (4) The shops and addresses selling sugar at discounted prices have been published in the newspapers. If there is any illegal refusal to sell, please report it. (5) All factories are open for inspection for three days before the bidding. (6) Repeated investigations into the sale of cloth at discounted prices have shown that there are few malpractices. Investigations into the sale of oil and fish are more difficult, and there may be some shortcomings in prevention, which will be corrected. However, the purpose of selling at discounted prices is directly to benefit the buyers and indirectly to suppress prices. The Bureau's sale at discounted prices has been effective. (7) After the withdrawal of Japanese nationals, their houses will be returned to the original owners if they can prove ownership and have not engaged in collaboration with the enemy. Otherwise, they will be disposed of by the Bureau. The agencies renting these houses should pay rent, and the contract can be signed by the tenant and the landlord themselves.

The Most Abundant Material is Cloth

(8) The quantity of materials cannot be reported because the warehouses have not been inventoried, but the most abundant material is cloth, followed by less grain, and many military supplies. (9) The warehouses taken over by the Navy have been checked by the Customs, and the shortage is being investigated. (10) Factories owned by Koreans and Taiwanese people can be returned if they have not engaged in enemy activities; otherwise, they will be confiscated. (11) Among the goods that factories were forced to cooperate with and hand over in the past, cloth was the most abundant. However, the enemy and puppets paid compensation at the time of confiscation, and it is extremely difficult to identify the ownership of the cloth, making it extremely difficult to return it. (12) The materials taken over by Jiang Gongmei have been handed over to the Third Front Army. The details of what is currently stored in the Bureau's Investigation Group are pending investigation. (13) When Japanese nationals leave, they need to hand over their assets. The Bureau has cooperated with the Japanese Overseas Chinese Management Committee and plans to find a large building to house these items in the future. (14) Regarding the regulations that manufacturers in this city were forced to cooperate with or illegally bought out their factory properties under enemy and puppet pressure and were separately confiscated by the Shanghai District Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau after the victory, these manufacturers protested in groups because they did not accept the review. When reporters inquired about this issue with the Disposal Bureau, Director Liu replied: "Although forced cooperation and buyouts are facts, these merchants were not without benefits at the time. Therefore, the Bureau does not intend to consider this." This newspaper reporter asked: (1) What is the progress of the investigation into the warehouse theft case? Liu replied that the Bureau has sent each theft case to the Executive Yuan and is currently investigating it. (2) The properties of traitors must be disposed of after the judgment. (3) The first batch of socks and basins sold at discounted prices has been sold out, but there are still 20,000 pairs of socks and 30,000 basins available for sale.

### New Life Movement Branch Associations of Various Organizations are Actively Being Organized

(Report from this newspaper) The Shanghai New Life Movement Promotion Association, in accordance with the New Life Movement General Association in Chongqing, has uniformly changed its name to the New Life Movement Committee, under which branch associations are established. The work is promoted according to the outline of organizing basic units in various agencies, organizations, and schools. Currently, the Municipal Bureau of Public Works and the Songhu Garrison Headquarters are the fastest in establishing branch associations in the aspect of various agencies and organizations. Other bureaus and agencies and schools are also actively organizing them.

### The Bureau of Social Affairs Convenes an Evaluation Committee to Study the Financing of Funds

In order to stabilize prices as the Lunar New Year approaches, the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs convened the first Price Evaluation Committee on the afternoon of the 10th. The representatives of various agencies who attended were Xu Jiliao, Fang Zhichao, Jin Runxiang, Ge Jechen, etc., and the experts Liu Dajun, Wu Chengxi, Wei Youyi, etc. were also present. Ge Kexin, Acting Director of the Bureau of Social Affairs, presided over the meeting, and the following results were discussed: (1) Order various trade associations to report price changes at any time. (2) Request the Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau to sell the sealed materials at low prices as soon as possible to stabilize prices. (3) It was resolved that merchants' reasonable profits should not exceed 20%. In order to guide idle funds towards normal development, the various committees of the association are currently studying with the Bureau of Social Affairs whether it is necessary to restore the capital market and other exchanges for financing funds. It is also learned that in order to solicit opinions from all walks of life, the association has publicly decided to hire Peng Xuepei, Chen Xing, Zhang Ziyi, Chen Bozhuang, Liu Gongyun, Xuan Yiwu, Liu Zhisheng, Pan Xuanyi, Li Zhaoji, Luo Qinghua, and others as consultants to the association, and plans to hire experts from various industries as special committee members to work together to stabilize prices appropriately.

### Yang Wendao: Please Approve Bail for Recuperation

(Report from this newspaper) Lawyer Tang Huaiqun, who defended Yang Wendao pro bono ten years ago, recently told reporters that the Yang case has been approved by the chairman and handed over to the Ministry of Judicial Administration for handling, which shows the government's determination to maintain the dignity of the law. However, when the case was tried ten years ago, everyone knew that the Japanese wanted to take the opportunity to complete their political conspiracy. I also undertook this case pro bono entirely out of righteous indignation. Therefore, Yang Wendao may also be regarded as a political prisoner. Now that political prisoners arrested for anti-Japanese activities have been released one after another, Yang Wendao is still imprisoned in a frail and sick body. If he dies in prison, wouldn't it be a great injustice? Tang has submitted a request to the Ministry of Judicial Administration, requesting that he be granted bail for recuperation first, pending trial. In addition, the Cantonese venereal disease doctor Qiu Huimin, who reported Yang Wendao as the murderer to the Japanese detective ten years ago, was executed by shooting in Guangzhou in the 27th year of the Republic of China for being a traitor.

### Envoy Niu Goes to Hangzhou

The central government sent two envoys, Ye Chucang and Niu Yongjian, to the two cities of Beijing and Shanghai and to the three provinces of Zhejiang and Anhui. Since arriving in Shanghai at the beginning of last month to offer condolences, more than a month has passed. They have received approximately 430 letters of complaint from the people, which have been sorted and forwarded to the central government. It is now learned that Envoy Niu is scheduled to go to Hangzhou today for condolences, accompanied by Wang Yi, chairman of the Zhejiang Road Special Party Department. Envoy Ye is staying in the hospital for recuperation due to political harmony and was unable to go together.

### Nanjing West Road Will Be Widened

(Report from this newspaper) The municipal government believes that the road around the racetrack on Nanjing West Road (Jing'an Temple Road) is not wide enough, which leads to traffic congestion. It has now been decided to widen it to 27 meters, which is 18 to 28 feet wider than the current road. According to this plan, in addition to filling in the river next to the racetrack, the walls there must also be demolished, and part of the racetrack inside the walls must be ceded. As for the implementation plan, the municipal government has ordered the Bureau of Public Works and the Bureau of Land Administration to jointly draft it.

Widening Jielu Road: Plan Drafted

The Municipal Bureau of Public Works has completed the engineering plan to widen Jielu Road on Zhejiang Road. It has been decided to start work from Jielu Road at the North Railway Station and then extend it to Zhejiang Road. It is reported that it is currently waiting for the railway authorities to remove the iron fence near the North Railway Station. Once completed, work can begin. It is estimated that this project will require hundreds of road construction workers. At the same time, in order to take care of the people's housing, it has been decided not to affect the people's housing on both sides as much as possible.

### US Representatives Arrive in Shanghai to Investigate Surplus Materials

(Report from this newspaper) The US State Department dispatched five representatives, including US congressmen and army representatives, to China to investigate the US military's surplus materials.

After the interrogation, Section Chief Chen of the Investigation Section addressed the representatives, instructing all employees not to take any excessive actions that would lead to offenses, and that everything should be handled through proper procedures, awaiting legal resolution. The authorities are determined to handle the case with the strictest and fairest attitude. At 5:00 PM, the Garrison Headquarters summoned Shu Yueqiao again to investigate the process of reporting Li Ze.

### Special Criminal Tribunal of the High Court; Continued Trial of Four Chinese Traitors Yesterday

(Report from this newspaper) The Special Criminal Tribunal of the Higher Court at Tilanqiao continuously held trials for four traitor cases yesterday, starting at 9:00 AM. The details are as follows:

Yang Xiguang

43 years old, from Shandong. He was the head of the Special High Section of the Puppet Chengdu Road Police Bureau, specializing in intelligence work for the enemy. After the victory, he was reported and arrested. Judge Zhu Zonghai presided over the case yesterday. According to Yang's confession, it was true that he served as the head of the Special High Section and was ordered to arrest Han Zhen, who was responsible for air force liaison intelligence in Shanghai. However, after Han was arrested, he tried to prevent Han from being sent to the enemy's military police headquarters and even managed to bail him out. He later engaged in underground work. Han's wife, Zhu Qisun, testified that this was true, but because Han himself has now gone to Chongqing and cannot testify in person, the court ordered that the trial be adjourned until Han's own testimony arrives. The defendant was not allowed bail and was returned to custody. Judge Cao Jun then proceeded with the trial.

Chen Bohua

Chen is 42 years old, from Shaoxing, Zhejiang, and graduated from the Law and Commerce Department of Chizhi College. He served as Deputy Director of the Puppet Ministry of Communications' Shanghai Office, Counselor of the Puppet Ministry of Social Affairs, and Standing Committee Member of the Puppet Two-Road Special Party Headquarters. After the victory, he was reported and arrested by the Party Headquarters. However, Chen claimed that he was coerced into taking the puppet positions by "76," but later used this as a cover. He contacted Ai Guofan, who was a secretary and legal advisor at the Swiss Consulate, and constantly provided intelligence. He claimed that he had not committed any crimes endangering the country. The court ordered that, because Ai Guofan did not arrive today, a detailed investigation and summons would be conducted before a further trial. The trial continued at the original location in the afternoon.

Zhang Jingen

Zhang was a foreman and translator for the Japanese field warehouse and was arrested by youth league members at the Nanguo Restaurant. However, Zhang claimed that he had not endangered the local area, and designated lawyer Ge Zhiqin defended him. The court ordered that after the investigation is completed, a date will be set for sentencing. Court President Liu Yugui then presided over the trial.

Fang Zude

Fang served as a driver and translator for the Japanese military police in Wusong, and there were reports that he had used his power to seize civilian houses. However, Fang claimed that the rental of the houses was done through legal procedures and was not seizure. Because the accuser, Wang Deqing, did not arrive, the court ordered that the case needed further investigation and rescheduled the hearing.

Also, it was reported that the traitor case of Zhang Yizhi and others will be tried tomorrow morning.

### Severance Pay for Workers in Japanese Factories; Supplementary Payments to Begin Today

### U.S. Military Headquarters Plans to Assist Our Withdrawal of Japanese Nationals in China; To Date, 200,000 People Have Been Repatriated

The U.S. Military Headquarters announced today that work to assist our country in repatriating Japanese nationals is being expedited. To date, a total of 200,000 Japanese nationals have been repatriated. According to a report from January 1946, a total of 202,031 Japanese nationals in Northern China, Shanghai, and Taiwan have been repatriated.

The work of repatriating Japanese, Taiwanese, and Korean nationals has not yet begun. The work of assisting our repatriation of Japanese, Taiwanese, and Korean nationals back to their home countries will be completed by September 30 of this year. This is based on a detailed plan by the U.S. Army Transportation Corps. A total of 34 ships will be used to transport Japanese nationals back to their home countries, all of which are Japanese ships, along with 90 landing craft. Japanese sailors are still used on board. Currently, approximately 7,000 Japanese nationals are repatriated daily, and this can be increased to 10,000 next week. Starting February 1, it is expected to increase to 15,000 people. By July 1 of this year, the number of Japanese nationals repatriated daily can be increased to 25,000. Colonel Weitmon, Director of the U.S. Army Transportation Corps, stated that the ships repatriating Japanese nationals are all under the control of General MacArthur's headquarters. The U.S. Military Headquarters will be guided by MacArthur in the work of repatriating Japanese nationals. On the 15th of this month, MacArthur will summon U.S. military personnel responsible for repatriating Japanese nationals in Tokyo to give detailed instructions to accelerate the work of repatriating Japanese nationals. At the same time, major issues regarding the repatriation of Taiwanese and Korean nationals will be discussed. The work of repatriating Japanese nationals will prioritize the repatriation of Japanese nationals in Shanghai, Taiwan, and North China as the first basic plan, the repatriation of Japanese nationals in South China as the second plan, and the repatriation of Japanese nationals in Hainan Island, Vietnam, and the Three Eastern Provinces will be carried out after the first and second plans are completed.

Trial of War Criminals; Announcement of Postponement

The U.S. War Crimes Tribunal has completed all preparatory work for the trial of war criminals. As the order to begin the trial has not been received from Washington, the work of trying war criminals has been repeatedly postponed. Several U.S. military officers serving on the tribunal have also returned to the United States a few days ago because they have accumulated sufficient service points. The tribunal has repeatedly

indicated to the U.S. government, and has not received a specific response. Therefore, the trial of 51 Japanese war criminals and other nationalities of traitors by the U.S. military in Shanghai will not be carried out as scheduled.

Two Batches of Japanese Prisoners of War; About to be Repatriated

The tenth and eleventh batches of Japanese prisoners of war have been concentrated for inspection and boarded ships for repatriation in the past two days. The tenth batch totaled 3,266 people, and the eleventh batch totaled 3,239 people. The number of people repatriated next week will increase again. The authorities of the Japanese Prisoner of War Administration in the Nanjing-Shanghai area are considering whether the Japanese prisoners of war on duty in this city should be transferred back for centralized repatriation, or whether they should continue to serve and send back first the Japanese prisoners of war from Wuxi and Zhenjiang to Shanghai.

### Water and Electricity for Enemy and Puppet Properties; All Fees Should be Paid According to Regulations; Nearly 3,000 Lease Mediation Cases

After the surrender of the Japanese army, the enemy and puppet properties in this city were taken over by various agencies for use or allocated to personnel coming to Shanghai from the rear. However, it was found that these residences were all equipped with gas, water, and electricity. Therefore, the companies began to clean up to complete the transfer procedures and charge fees according to regulations. However, some military personnel, unaware of the regulations, often obstructed the company personnel. The Songhu Garrison Headquarters of this city specifically issued a notice yesterday to ban this and to pay the fees according to the regulations of the companies.

Pre-War Residents; All Can Move Back

According to the Housing Lease Management Committee of this city, the number of lease mediation cases handled by the office has reached 2,857 to date. Some have been resolved peacefully through mediation, but some have not been resolved after several mediations. As for tenants who left their houses due to the war and have never contacted the landlord to move back in the past eight years, the person in charge believes that regardless of whether the house is located in Nanshi, Hongkou, or West Shanghai and the city center, as long as the residents have taken refuge elsewhere due to the war and have not gone through the procedures for returning the lease, they can request to move back. If the landlord (first and second landlords) obstructs without reason, they can go directly to the mediation group on the third floor of the Housing Lease Management Committee, fill out an application for mediation form, and request a public ruling.

### More Than 400 U.S. Military Vehicle Accidents

### Minyu Ship Floated After Salvage; Into Shipyard for Repairs

[Report from this newspaper] The Minsheng Company's Minyu ship has been salvaged and floated yesterday and was towed to the Jiangnan Shipyard for repairs yesterday evening. However, this project is more complicated. Most of the China Merchants Bureau's famous ships are used for demobilization, resulting in a shortage of ships on various routes. The Jianghan ship arrived in Shanghai today and is scheduled to sail to Wuhan on the 14th. The Minsheng Company had a small ship towing an iron

from Chongqing on behalf of the port, with many passengers, berthed at Pier 13 on the Bund to land.

### Letter from Mr. Chen Changtong

Having just read today's Shen Bao and News Paper disclosing what I said yesterday about the new exchange rate issue, the section "The foreign exchange issue can be decided and announced after President Song returns to Chongqing" does not match what I said at the time. My personal opinion is only that it is necessary to decide the exchange rate as soon as possible, but the issue is extremely complicated and should not be rushed without full and thorough consideration. Moreover, this issue is extremely important and should be deliberated and decided by the highest authorities in Chongqing. I am hereby sending this special letter to request that you be kind enough to correct it. Chen Changtong respectfully

### Peng Xuepei Reports on the Handling of Enemy and Puppet Properties: Inventory of Warehouses Still Requires One Month; 83 Factories to be Put Up for Public Auction

Mr. Peng Xuepei reported yesterday at a press conference on the "Situation of Handling Enemy and Puppet Properties in the Past Two Months," with a total of twelve points. This should allow the public to have a more concrete understanding of the handling of enemy properties. The original text is recorded as follows:

The Shanghai District Enemy and Puppet Property Review Committee and Handling Bureau were established on October 29, 1945, and have been in operation for over two months. All handling of enemy and puppet properties is carried out in accordance with the "Measures for Handling Enemy and Puppet Properties" promulgated by the Executive Yuan. The handling of various enemy and puppet properties over the past two months is briefly described as follows:

Wharves and Warehouses

Warehouses are the hub of materials, so the takeover work is the most arduous. Moreover, the types and materials of the materials vary, and they must be carefully identified. The Jianghai Customs regularly dispatches more than 500 field staff, divided into groups. As of January 9, 247 units, totaling 769 warehouses, have been sealed and managed by the Customs. Among them, 127 units, totaling 469 warehouses, have completed the inventory of materials. The rest are being inventoried as quickly as possible, and it is expected to be completed in about a month. As for about 200 warehouses of Allied merchants and civilians, about half have been inventoried and returned to their original owners. The 136 warehouses of Chinese merchants and banks have been started to be sorted out, and the materials are being returned separately. The tonnage of the warehouses has been maximized by the Jianghai Customs to be vacated for the storage of materials when they arrive in Shanghai.

Factories

According to the regulations on the handling of factory equipment, raw materials, and finished products, the Ministry of Economic Affairs is entrusted to take over. The ministry has taken over a total of 329 factories. In addition to 16 factories allocated to the Resources Committee and 20 factories to be allocated to the Textile Industry Management Committee, there are a total of more than 930,000 yarn spindles, 220,000 thread spindles, and more than 16,000 looms. Also, 11 factories have been allocated to the China Silk Corporation. A total of 83 factories have been decided to be put up for auction in two batches, and 115 factories have been returned. The handling of the remaining factories is being expedited.

Real Estate

It is stipulated that enemy and puppet real estate should first be used by government agencies and public enterprises. By the end of last year, 473 units had been applied for. Although government agencies have taken over a total of 616 units, the supply and demand are still difficult to meet due to (1) most receiving agencies are using the received houses, (2) some larger houses are borrowed by the US military, (3) civilian properties are being returned successively, and (4) the Japanese residential area needs to wait for the repatriation of Japanese before a large number of houses are vacated. It is believed that the number of enemy and puppet houses after the property rights are cleared is not very large, and it is not enough to alleviate the housing shortage if it is not used economically. Therefore, it was reported to President Song, who instructed: (1) Enemy and puppet houses shall not be used unless approved by the Executive Yuan for lease. When an agency approved by the Executive Yuan for lease uses the house, no agency shall refuse without reason. (2) Houses unrelated to military equipment, factories, warehouses, farms, and schools should be handed over for unified planning. (3) Military agencies and troops shall use the original enemy headquarters, barracks, and officers' residences, and vacate the ordinary houses they occupy. A portion of the aforementioned barracks and officers' residences should be reserved for the Garrison Command to provide temporary accommodation for transit officers and soldiers. (4) Municipal government agencies should make every effort to allocate and utilize the recovered local public properties and Municipal Council public properties. The district party headquarters, regiment headquarters, police stations, and defense corps should use suitable houses as a principle. (5) Central government agencies in Shanghai applying for houses should first ask their主管部会 (supervisory departments) to verify whether there is a need to establish an institution in Shanghai, as well as the staff size and housing budget, and allocate them accordingly. Furthermore, the utilization of enemy and puppet real estate is stipulated to be leasing and selling. Some agencies still believe that the government can allocate them without any fees, which is also one of the reasons for excessive applications.

Means of Transportation

A. Water transportation: The China Merchants Bureau has taken over about 250 ships in the Shanghai area from the East Asia Shipping Co., Ltd., the puppet China Shipping Co., Ltd., and the puppet Inland River Shipping Co., Ltd. As for the ships previously taken over by the Naval Headquarters, except for 58 ships requested to be retained, the remaining 119 ships have begun to be transferred to the China Merchants Bureau for management. As of January 9, the Ministry of the Navy has transferred a total of 80 ships. In addition, the British Shanghai Dock Company was returned to its original owner on December 3. Also, 185 ships of Allied merchants and civilians and 33 ships of 15 domestic merchants and civilians have been returned successively. B. Land transportation: The Wartime Transportation Administration has taken over 130 trucks from the Huazhong Transportation Company, 20 trucks from the Yoshizaki Transportation Office, and 100 trucks transferred from the Third Theater Command, totaling 250 trucks. Regarding the passenger cars, the bureau is handling them uniformly in accordance with the resolution of the Review Committee. A total of 30 passenger cars have been returned to Allied officials and merchants.

Grain

As of January 9, the quantity of main materials received by the special commissioner's office of the Ministry of Food is as follows: a total of 5,607 shi of rice, 351,406 bags of flour, 6,823,384 jin of corn, 333,540 jin of broad beans, 82,124 jin of barley, 149,491 packages of wheat, 4,145,636 jin of sorghum, and 36,548 packages of grain.

Farms

In accordance with the instructions of the Executive Yuan, including sericulture, aquatic products, animal husbandry, epidemic prevention serum manufacturing, and cotton production improvement, which are under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, a total of 50 units have been entrusted to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry for management, including 31 farms, 10 fisheries, 4 animal husbandry units, 2 cotton production units, 2 sericulture units, and 1 epidemic prevention unit.

Education and Culture

In terms of education, a total of 78 units have been taken over, including 10 universities and colleges, 5 research institutes, 1 library, 21 Japanese schools, 2 German schools, 2 puppet normal schools, 12 puppet middle schools, and 25 puppet primary schools. In addition, a total of 64 units have been taken over in terms of newspapers, including 8 newspapers, 5 news agencies, 7 radio stations, 11 printing and typesetting companies, 16 bookstores and stationery stores, 8 film studios, and 9 theaters.

Military Supplies

Military supplies are taken over by the Ministry of National Defense, airplanes are taken over by the Aviation Committee, and warships are taken over by the Naval Headquarters, including 21 gunboats with a total of 7,570 tons and 66 survey boats and transport boats with a total of 1,712 tons.

Trading Companies

According to the reports submitted by the Japanese, a total of 500 trading companies operated by Japanese merchants have been investigated. In addition to 208 companies taken over by the Central Trust Bureau, more than 200 companies are still under investigation. 47 units of German僑商 (merchant residents) have been identified, of which 14 units have been taken over by the bureau and are being sorted out, with Diefu and Bayer being the largest.

Investigation and Cracking Down

As of January 9, a total of 1,530 secret reports have been received and thoroughly investigated by dispatched personnel. Some of them were found to be untrue or repetitive. Those that were found to be true after investigation were quickly dealt with according to law. A considerable amount of materials has been seized successively. The important ones include 172,776 tons of pig iron, 1,337 pieces of cotton cloth, 4,661 taels of gold, 10.36 million 法幣 (legal tender), 5,245 boxes of western medicine, 44,656 boxes of soap, 10,534 bags of sugar, 425 newspapers, and the settled cases are now being evaluated and reviewed in order to issue secret report bonuses in order. However, due to the cumbersome evaluation procedures, as of the 9th, a total of 39 cases have been notified to receive the awards. The evaluation work has entered the right track, and the issuance of awards will definitely be accelerated from now on.

Price Stabilization

In order to stabilize prices, regulate the market, and universally supply various users, the bureau has successively sold sealed materials at parity prices. At the same time, in order to avoid strong stimulation of the market, causing prices to plummet and affecting production and social order, the method of gradually suppressing prices in batches and in stages is adopted. A total of 853 boxes of cigarettes, 2,155 boxes of soap, 1,823 baskets of matches, 606 boxes of洋燭 (foreign candles), 477 tons of ice eggs, 4,000 tons of ice fish, 3,200 dan of sugar, 8,000 市担 (market dan) of beans, 8,000 市担 of cooking oil, 600 tons of salted meat, 217 tons of pork and beef, 110 市担 of soy sauce, 800 pounds of seasoning powder, 20,000 dozen line socks, 40,000 porcelain washbasins, 1,498 bundles of newspapers, and 50,000 bolts of cloth have been sold (another 50,000 bolts have been shipped to Beijing-Hankou-Chongqing and 50,000 bolts to Tianjin). Recently, with the Lunar New Year approaching, the bureau has decided to supply a large amount of cotton yarn and daily necessities at parity prices to prevent market fluctuations.

Handling Procedures

The bureau strives to be cautious and thorough in handling various property rights and other cases, in order to avoid injustice. The procedure for handling cases is first investigated by the主管組 (department in charge). If necessary, the parties and witnesses must be questioned to clarify the entire case. Then, the department will sign its opinions and submit them to the legal counsel of each group for research, and then submit them to the Legal Counsel Committee for review. Finally, it is submitted to the Review Committee for review. For those with major connections, they must be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. For example, the sale of factories must first be evaluated by the Evaluation Committee in order to be fair and appropriate, and must be repeatedly adjusted and coordinated according to market prices and price fluctuations. As for the issuance of secret report bonuses, the price must be evaluated after the investigation, and the evaluation must be reviewed, in order to seek fairness and reason. The above is a general overview of the work of the committee and bureau for more than two months. The matter is arduous, and omissions are inevitable. I hope that people from all walks of life will give more advice, so as to make up for the shortcomings.

### Armaments: Submarine Detector

— Cong Zhi

During the early stages of World War II, the German U-boats (U-boat, German name is U-boot, which means Unterseeboot, meaning submarine) roamed the Atlantic, sinking many Allied warships and merchant ships; but they eventually disappeared, which was the result of the Allies' active sweep with "Sonoradio buoy." This secret has only recently been revealed.

The exploration methods of using radar or lookouts are certainly very effective for submarines that remain on the surface, but they are useless for submarines that hide under the surface. The "Sonoradio buoy" gives the plane "ears" to hear the sound of U-boats under the surface, measure their position, and track them. Once the enemy submarine's whereabouts have been detected, the aircraft can either attack it on its own or call nearby destroyers to destroy it.

The pursuing aircraft can also learn about the results of the entire attack from the "Sonoradio buoy," simply by capturing the underwater sounds. Sometimes you can even hear the propeller sound of the U-boat, which is the sound it makes when it flees from battle. Sometimes there is only a loud bang, followed by an unusual silence, which indicates that the U-boat has been destroyed.

According to Dr. John T. Tate of the US National Defense Research Committee, the "Sonoradio buoy" is the achievement of Group 6 of the committee. The research work was completed at the Navy's Underwater Acoustics Experimental Laboratory in New London, Connecticut.

Dr. Tate said: "The 'Sonoradio buoy' was not invented by an inventor who was accidentally inspired. It is the result of a group of trusted scientists and engineers in close contact with submarines in the Atlantic for a long time."

He said that the ideal of the "Sonoradio buoy" is not novel and unfounded. It is actually derived from a bulky, tethered buoy from the Naval Research Institute. That old-fashioned buoy was used to protect the harbor when it was impossible to lay underwater telephone cables. But it was a fresh idea to put this thing on a plane to participate in the submarine sweep.

This improved "Sonoradio buoy" must be lightweight in order to be loaded on airplanes in large quantities, have a low cost to meet practical applications, and have a strong structure to withstand the impact of waves. In addition, it must be powered by batteries for several hours and have the appropriate radio frequency and sufficient radio wave strength.

The plane exploring the enemy submarine first throws a "Sonoradio buoy" into the water. The buoy floats in the water, uses the underwater telephone microphone to collect underwater sounds, converts the sound waves into tiny voltage fluctuations, and then amplifies them in the transmitter part of the buoy and turns them into radio waves that are released into the air. The person on the plane who receives the radio can twist to the same frequency as the buoy's transmitter and listen to the sounds.

The listener can easily learn to distinguish between natural underwater sounds and extraneous underwater noises, such as the sound of a submarine's propeller. Once the personnel on the plane have detected the position of the underwater submarine, they can send a message to the destroyer base and immediately dispatch a ship to attack the enemy submarine. The plane can hover over the area and can follow the enemy ship closely, dropping "Sonoradio buoys" along the way to measure its position at any time.

Essay

### The Moon is Indeed Better Abroad

— Su Yin

"The moon is also better abroad," I think this sentence has its truth, and there is no reason to satirize it.

A picture with a person or anything as the main body must be matched with a beautiful and appropriate background to bring out the beauty of the main body, which is a painting trick that everyone understands. If pictures are like this, how can actual scenes be different? For the景 (scene) of the 主體 (main body), whether in a painting or in an actual scene, in addition to natural clouds, mountains, and rivers, artificial embellishments are indispensable.

Abroad, a moon hangs on top of an architecturally artistic church spire, and the soft moonlight falls on a green, tidy lawn and a white, wide road; the trees on the side of the road are so well-trimmed and upright, and the scattered villages in the distance are so quaint and charming, coupled with blue sky, white clouds, distant mountains, and flowing water, the impression given to the moon viewer by this whole scene is undoubtedly beautiful and lovely, and at the same time, he feels that the moon is crystal clear and full, and the moonlight is extraordinarily quiet, beautiful, and poetic. Although the moon abroad may not have such a background everywhere, similar situations are probably very common.

But what about the moon in China? Can you find such embellishments as those abroad? Clouds, sky, mountains, and rivers are also available, but beautiful embellishments of churches, lawns, and other completely artificial and semi-artificial objects are difficult to find. At most, all that is available are those desolate cities, ruined battlements, Xiao temples, ancient temples, thatched huts, lonely boats, and even the graves of the dead, and a piece of叢莽 (untamed undergrowth). In this kind of situation, the moon will only appear lonely, bleak, and cold, giving you the feeling of desolation, sadness, and even horror. Compared with the emotions caused by the moon abroad—beauty and comfort—would you say "the moon in China is better"?

As for "fathers are also better abroad," that is an undeniable fact. Abroad, parents who have attended parent training schools (which is not a rare thing) certainly know better how to be a reasonable parent. Even those who have not received this special training, because of the high general level of education, have more open minds and can treat and educate their children with more reasonable attitudes and methods. Compared with the stubborn, autocratic, and ignorant parents of ordinary families and countries, would you say "the fathers in China are better"?

"Belittling one's own ambition and fostering others' power" is certainly undesirable, but why don't we eliminate the root cause of this "short-sighted" talk, and only obliterate the truth of this talk and argue back? Xi Yuan

### Notes on Attending a Moral Lecture

— Xi Yuan

In Shanghai, where voices, colors, goods, profits, money, and drunken dreams abound, there is actually a moral lecture that is publicly lectured every week to promote morality and save the terminal customs, which is indeed a rare and valuable thing. This lecture is co-organized by the Confucian Society, Ningbo Association, Chongde Association, and Moral Society. The venue is at Cangzhou Shuchang on Chengdu Road. A lecture is given every Sunday morning, with about two or three hundred listeners each time. On December 30, I went to listen to a lecture, and I felt that I had gained some insights into self-cultivation.

There were two lecturers on this day: one was Yang Zhongyi and the other was Sun Xiangzhong. Yang's topic was called "The Way of Following One's Nature." The main points were first written on the blackboard, and the content was divided into two major categories: "性功 (nature merit)" and "命功 (destiny merit)": "性功" was further divided into four minor categories: knowing nature, preserving nature, nourishing nature, and fulfilling nature. "命功" was also divided into four minor categories: knowing destiny, awaiting destiny, having no destiny, and establishing destiny. This kind of study of the mind and nature is originally extremely difficult to explain, but Yang explained it methodically, which is indeed not easy. Sun's topic was "Upholding Truth? Seeking True Happiness." Eight characters were written on the blackboard: "賢親樂利 (virtuousness, kinship, joy, and benefit)" and "身心性命 (body, mind, nature, and life)." The general idea is that people in China who talk about 理學 (Neo-Confucianism) tend to focus on "honoring the virtuous and loving their relatives," and despise "enjoying their joy and benefiting their benefits." They only talk about the study of nature and life, and do not know the way of body and mind, that is, they only focus on the inner world and ignore external things, and inevitably fall into emptiness. In the future, they must be reconciled and not focus on one side, so as to conform to the truth and obtain true happiness. These studies are originally old studies, but Sun explained them in a way that promotes the old and creates the new, which is indeed admirable.

The lecture ended at noon. I hurried home, and along the way, I thought about this lecture. In this time when people's hearts are 　首敎 (something omitted/ unclear), it is indeed good. Therefore, I have a few opinions to contribute to the organizers. (1) The content of the lectures should not be biased towards old morality, but should integrate ancient and modern Chinese and foreign theories to create a new Chinese morality. (2) The materials of the lectures should not be biased towards the three religions of Chinese Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism. Any philosophy, ethics, psychology, art, aesthetics, etc. related to morality can also be elaborated. (3) In addition to adults, the audience must absorb young people from the Shanghai business community and school students. (4) Each lecture must be recorded and the systematic ones printed into a book for wide circulation. The above four points are the hopes I have put forward from the standpoint of the audience, which are very superficial. I wonder what the lecture authorities think?

### The Night of Discovering Atomic Fission

— Jin Chun

That day was the evening of January 25, 1939. The weather was very cold, with strong winds. That night, at Columbia University in the United States, physicist Dr. Dunnin split the uranium atom for the first time, and for the first time invented the release of atomic energy.

Gusts of cold wind blew from the Hudson River, disrupting the ivy on the walls of the school. That morning, students were taking major exams, wrapped in scarves, going in and out of the Pupin Physics Laboratory, worrying about Physics 213 (Thermodynamics) and other physics courses. That morning, Dr. Dunnin's colleague, Dr. Fermi, had visited Dunnin, and the two discussed science and scientists. Because an assistant instructor had just returned from Princeton University, saying that the Danish physicist Bohr had come from Europe, and before he left, he heard that Dr. Hahn in Berlin had discovered barium and several other medium-weight atomic elements, which, after emitting neutral electrons with radiation, were found in the waste residue of the split uranium. It is said that Dr. Hahn said at the time, "As a chemist, once I see　, I know what it is; as a physicist, seeing this phenomenon, I simply don't know how to explain it." In fact, it is just the heaviest element that becomes a lighter element after fission. In this process, atomic energy is released. Although everyone thinks this is very simple now, it was indeed a novel and difficult thing at the time. Dunnin and Fermi were very interested in the problem of atomic energy. They had a machine that could measure this energy, so they discussed it: which is more suitable for experimentation, liquid uranium, solid uranium, or gaseous uranium? They went to lunch together and continued to discuss this issue during lunch. Fermi was going to Washington that afternoon to attend a scientific conference, and the two had not yet decided what material to use for the experiment when they parted.

Dunnin spent that afternoon pondering this problem in his office. By six o'clock, he braved the wind to go back, still unable to figure it out. He had dinner with his wife in the apartment. As dinner was coming to an end, he suddenly thought that it would be best to experiment with solid uranium. So he braved the wind and rushed back to his office. He put down his coat and hat and went straight to the laboratory in the basement. It was just after seven o'clock, and he began to organize his machine. The machine was simple: it was a clip with a substance that emits radiation, a container with a substance that is bombarded, and a seismograph that records the energy emitted after a substance is bombarded by points and lines displayed on a screen. (Ordinary uranium emits radiation that only shows dots on the screen when it is not bombarded.)

Dr. Dunnin placed a thin piece of uranium in the clip, put a mixture of beryllium and radium as a radiation emitter in the container, and after slightly adjusting the instrument, began the experiment. At this time, there were two other scientists in the laboratory: Dr. Buehler from Columbia University and Dr. Slack from Vanderbilt University. The two were wearing white coats because they had just conducted nuclear physics experiments and were busy cleaning up some instruments. Dr. Dunnin, however, was wearing a brown suit. All three thought that the experiment was unlikely to succeed. However, when Dunnin moved the radium clip to the radiation place, green wavy lines suddenly appeared on the screen of the seismograph, as if jumping straight from the screen. "Ah!" Dunnin said, "Is this really real!" Bu and Shi walked over together and were extremely shocked when they saw these amazing lines. Dunnin had some doubts in his heart. He said that there must be something wrong with his machine. Bu and Shi argued with him. Bu shouted, "Haven't you used this machine for several months! You know it's right." Shi also shouted, "This machine can't be wrong!" The three wanted to check whether the machine was accurate and decided to put a piece of cadmium in the place where the radiation passed. The property of cadmium is that it cannot transmit radiation. When they released the radiation again, all the lines on the screen of the seismograph disappeared. They used many more tests, and by nine o'clock, Dr. Dunnin, with a solemn expression, admitted that the release of atomic energy had actually been realized.

The three agreed not to reveal this secret for the time being. Dunnin returned to his office alone, the howling north wind raging outside. He studied alone for three full hours, calculating how much energy each atom released just now. His conclusion was that the atomic energy he released that night was about 120 million to 200 million volts. Such great power had never been dreamed of by mankind in history.

It was almost midnight, and Dr. Dunnin casually put aside the numbers he had calculated, left his office, and went home, pondering in the cold wind. Bao Zhongzuo

### Question of Nationality

— Bao Zhongzuo

According to a report by the famous American columnist Winchell: One day after dinner, Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin were chatting and asked each other what nationality they would like to be if they did not belong to their current nationality. Churchill said: "If I were not a Briton, I would like to be an American." Roosevelt said: "If I were not an American, I would like to be a Briton." Stalin said: "If I were not a Soviet citizen, I would feel ashamed."

### Spending Money for Japanese Prisoners

— Qu Shen

Newspaper reports: "The Japanese prisoners of war and officers in Zhejiang Province have stated that given the current situation of their country, all Japanese officers and soldiers should work hard and be self-reliant and not want to add to the burden of the country; all the pocket money issued will be returned and not accepted." On the other hand, the Japanese prisoners in Beijing are the opposite, and they have already　　　　　　　accepted what we have sent. Our Ministry of Military Administration sends pocket money to Japanese prisoners, which is to treat them preferentially; they dare not accept it, isn't that not appreciating the favor? In fact, this is the expression of their patriotism. We must be vigilant ourselves!

The price we paid for this victory was extremely high. Although it is called victory, it is full of devastation and the people are living in misery; all of our people should strive to build a new China in a positive way, and save as much as possible in a negative way, and not　　make unnecessary extravagance: one less expenditure is one more income.

### Sino-Belgian Radium Hospital Urgently Needs to Be Taken Over by Our Country - Reader's Letter States Inside Story

Mr. Editor: This has to be considered a great regret! We have been fighting the war for eight years, and we have won the victory for a full four months. I don't understand why the health authorities have neglected this only "Sino-Belgian Radium Hospital" in our country! Let its white body still be covered with a gray coat! The funding for the Sino-Belgian Radium Hospital was established with the Sino-Belgian Boxer Indemnity, which is public funds, and its nature should be a hospital that seeks welfare for everyone, but in fact it is the opposite, because it is controlled by foreigners, and it invisibly shows that it has a special meaning, The hospital's medical fees are set at the highest, and the income and expenditure are not made public. The salaries and benefits of the Chinese employees serving in the hospital are extremely meager. However, the treatment of several foreign nurses is superior. Recently, the medical director commissioned by our Chinese standing committee was squeezed out and almost unable to continue working. The patients in the hospital are all Chinese, and there have been no doctors to see patients for more than ten days!

Mr. Editor: Please imagine, our country has suffered all kinds of hardships in this war, isn't it to cleanse the past humiliation and recover all sovereignty? This hospital should of course be returned to our country, how can we let foreigners control it again? I have always admired your newspaper as the mouthpiece of the people, so I ventured to draft this letter in the hope of borrowing a corner of the page to make it public to the public, so that the authorities will pay attention and take it back as soon as possible, so that its white body will be covered with a sacred coat, the country is fortunate, the people are fortunate! I wish you good health. Luo Zhijing

Reader's Letter

### Inquiry about Scholarship Procedures

Mr. Editor: Please reply to the following question in a corner of the newspaper. I have always been a scholarship student of Newspaper A (high school). During the summer vacation of this year, I went to Tunxi to study. After the victory, due to the high tuition fees and other problems, I rushed back to Shanghai to continue my studies, but the scholarship from Qingbao had expired and I did not apply to receive it. This semester is about to end, and my family's economic situation has not improved, so I plan to continue to apply for a scholarship. I don't know what the procedures are? Is skipping one term treated as a new student? I hope you can publicly answer in detail. Reader Cheng Jinyu

(Answer) The scholarship students of this year have all passed the qualification examination. The student did not participate, so they cannot enjoy the treatment of old students according to the rules. However, we express our deep sympathy for those who are poor and unable to go to school. For the next scholarship, this newspaper has decided to cooperate with the Shanghai Education Loan Committee. In the future, you can apply to the committee. For detailed information, please pay attention to the news in this column.
