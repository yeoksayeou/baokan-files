### First National Assembly Preparatory Meeting: Lively Discussion on Methods for Electing Presidium, Representatives Fully Demonstrate Democratic Spirit

[Our Nanjing Office, 18th Dispatch] The National Assembly held a preparatory meeting at 10:00 AM on the 18th, with 1,372 representatives in attendance. Chairman Chiang, in his capacity as a National Representative, arrived at the venue at exactly 10:00 AM, with his wife arriving five minutes later. The meeting commenced at 10:10 AM. First, Hong Lanyou, Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee, gave a report, stating briefly: The National Assembly originally planned for 2,050 representatives, of which 1,690 were announced by the National Government. As of this morning, 1,501 representatives had registered, and by 10:00 AM, 1,289 had arrived, meeting the legal quorum, and the meeting was declared open. A motion was then made to publicly nominate a temporary chairman. Chen Jiesheng proposed Sun Ke, which was unanimously applauded. Mr. Sun then took the chair amidst a burst of spotlights and thunderous applause. The meeting began under Mr. Sun's guidance. Today's agenda was to discuss the election methods for the Presidium. Hong Lanyou first explained the draft, stating that the key point of the careful selection methods was to achieve the goal of electing the virtuous and capable. Representatives then spoke and discussed the points to be amended. Throughout the process, over thirty representatives spoke, but 104 had requested to speak. Due to time constraints, at the legally mandated adjournment time of 12:00 PM, the temporary chairman announced a half-hour extension. However, not all could speak, and the meeting adjourned at 12:40 PM. It was also decided to continue the preparatory meeting at 9:00 AM tomorrow to discuss the methods. The draft of the National Assembly Presidium election methods and the discussion process are recorded as follows:

(A) Draft: Article 1: Presidium candidates shall be elected by each representative-generating unit. Each unit shall elect at least one person, and units with more than ten representatives shall add one candidate for every additional ten representatives, rounding up any remainder less than ten. Elections shall be conducted by each unit using a non-named cumulative voting method, with those receiving more votes being elected, forming the overall list of candidates. Nominees are not limited to representatives from the originating unit.

Article 2: The Presidium shall consist of 55 members, elected by the National Assembly representatives from the overall list of Presidium candidates using a non-named cumulative voting method. Those receiving more votes shall be elected, and ties shall be resolved by drawing lots.

Article 3: The number of Presidium candidates selected by representatives directly appointed by the National Government who are elected as Presidium members should be generated in proportion to the number of representatives from each representative-generating unit. If the proportional quota is not met, it may be calculated separately.

Article 4: These methods shall be implemented after being approved by the National Assembly preparatory meeting.

(B) Discussion Process: Although today's discussion was only on the election methods for the Presidium, all representatives attached great importance to it, conducting research with extreme caution. Speakers were very enthusiastic, with 104 representatives requesting to speak. Due to time constraints, only over thirty were able to express their opinions. The situation was lively, and no decision could be reached by 12:30 PM. The chairman then announced that another preparatory meeting would be held at 9:00 AM on the 19th to continue the discussion. The various opinions are summarized as follows: 1. Professional representatives and regional representatives should be nominated separately, as they are generated separately. In particular, farmers', industrial, and commercial organizations should be nominated separately; 2. Special attention should be paid to farmers, as over 85% of China's population are farmers. Professional organizations and the interests of farmers should not be ignored; 3. It was proposed to amend the last sentence of Article 1 of the election methods, namely: "Nominees are not limited to representatives from the originating unit." Some suggested deleting the word "not," while others believed the entire sentence should be deleted; 4. Attention should be paid to ethnic minorities in the border regions, and special quotas should be given; 5. Conduct a general election regardless of region; 6. Allocate one person for every 37 people according to the total number of people; 7. Each unit nominates one person, first stipulating 55 units; 8. Request to allocate according to the following proportions: 20 regional representatives, 10 professional representatives, 2 freelance professionals, 4 specially selected representatives, 19 representatives directly appointed by the National Government, for a total of 55 people.

[Our Nanjing Office, 18th Dispatch] Dozens of speakers at the National Assembly preparatory meeting on the election methods for the Presidium truly demonstrated democratization. According to Chen Lifu, the National Assembly is the first step towards democracy. We are very pleased with today's enthusiastic situation, as democracy is essentially a waste of time. However, this waste of time is to integrate opinions from all parties, so for the sake of perfect opinions, although it may feel time-consuming, it is still necessary.

[Our Nanjing Office, 18th Dispatch] Wu Tiecheng flew from Shanghai to Nanjing at 8:30 AM on the 18th and immediately attended the National Assembly preparatory meeting.

### Central Memorial Week: Chairman Chiang Delivers Instructions

Urging the Formulation of a Sound Constitution

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th Dispatch] Due to the National Assembly preparatory meeting, the Central Memorial Week, originally scheduled to begin at 10:00 AM, was moved forward to 8:30 AM today. Central Executive and Supervisory Committee members, heads of various agencies, vice ministers, and Kuomintang members among the National Assembly representatives attended. Chairman Chiang personally led the ceremony and delivered instructions, stating briefly: I am very pleased to gather with all the representatives because of the National Assembly meeting. Convening the National Assembly has been the goal for which our party and the people of the whole country have struggled for many years. Our party, in accordance with the teachings of the late Premier and all the martyrs and their revolutionary spirit, has worked hard for more than fifty years to convene the National Assembly, promulgate the Constitution, and lay the foundation for national construction. Therefore, this conference is truly related to the success or failure of our national construction cause, and you all bear a very important responsibility. I hope that in this decisive meeting, we can formulate a sound constitution to comfort the spirits of the late Premier and all the martyrs in heaven. The Chairman then urged the representatives to be kind and humble, to be orderly and disciplined during the meetings. After the speech, he led the reading of the Party members' code of conduct, and the ceremony concluded after forty minutes.

No changes were made to the principles today, only textual revisions were made. It is reported that most of it has been reviewed. A second meeting will be held at 3:00 PM on the 19th, which is expected to complete everything.

### Zeng Qi Discusses Constitution-Making

Should Be Trans-Partisan and Trans-Regional

[Our Nanjing Office, 18th Dispatch] Zeng Qi delivered a speech on constitution-making at a dinner party for representatives from Sichuan, Xikang, Yunnan, Guizhou, and other provinces and cities on the 18th, emphasizing that the Constitution is trans-partisan and trans-regional, made for the country, not for parties or regions. National interests and ethnic interests should be paramount, and no one party or faction can impose its unilateral will on the entire Constitution. He also stated that the Youth Party has no unilateral intentions and will strive for the integrity of the Constitution. Recently, he has felt unwell and is resting.

### Li Huang to Arrive in Nanjing Soon

Recently, he has felt unwell and is resting.

[Central News Agency, This City] Youth Party leader Li Huang has been working hard for peace recently, which has been tiring. He feels slightly unwell and, following his doctor's advice, is resting for a while and will arrive in Nanjing soon to attend the National Assembly.

[Our Hankou Office, 18th Dispatch] Youth Party representative Chen Yiqing arrived in Hankou by car from Hunan on the 17th and is scheduled to fly to Nanjing on the afternoon of the 18th or the morning of the 19th with Hu Zixiang, Li Yuhua, and other party representatives stationed in Hankou to attend the National Assembly.

### Democratic Socialist Party Representatives Arrive in Beiping from Nanjing: Discuss Participation in National Assembly. Chen Cheng and Others Meet with Zhang Junmai

[Our Beiping Office, 18th Dispatch] Zhang Junmai's representative, Sun Baogang, flew to Beiping at 5:00 PM on the 18th and drove to the residence of Hu Haimen, a Standing Committee member of the Democratic Socialist Party, to rest and attend a dinner hosted by Hu, accompanied by Liang Qiushui, another Standing Committee member of the party, and more than a dozen other important Democratic Socialist Party members. The issue of the Democratic Socialist Party's participation in the National Assembly was discussed during the dinner. It is reported that Sun stated to Hu, Liang, and others after disembarking that Mr. Junmai sent him to solicit the opinions of colleagues in the north. Mr. Junmai has no intention of making a decision on the issue of participation in the National Assembly alone. As of the time of this dispatch, the dinner at Hu's residence had not yet ended. Zhang Dongsheng, the second-in-command of the Democratic Socialist Party, paced around his room and felt extremely uneasy after receiving a telegram from Zhang Junmai yesterday urging him to go to Nanjing. Today, reporters visited him twice, but Zhang remained tight-lipped, saying that he was unwilling to make any comments before consulting with his colleagues and making a decision. It is reported that Zhang telegraphed the Shanghai headquarters of the Democratic Socialist Party on the 16th, opposing participation in the National Assembly, stating: "Do not vote to participate, otherwise the party will split." As of today, Zhang's intention seems to remain firm. As of 5:00 PM this afternoon, Zhang was still in the faculty dormitory No. 31 of Yenching University, anxiously pondering this important issue. According to his wife, Zhang and Liang Shuming will attend a dinner hosted by Pan Guangdan at Tsinghua University tonight. Someone familiar with the party's internal affairs said: The Democratic Socialist Party has seven Standing Committee members. The Shanghai side has four Standing Committee members, of which three support participation in the National Assembly and one opposes; Beiping has three Standing Committee members, namely Zhang Dongsheng, Hu Haimen, and Liang Qiushui, who oppose participation. Therefore, the Democratic Socialist Party is likely to split over this issue. It is not yet known what the outcome of Sun Baogang's visit and discussions with Zhang and others will be as of the time of this dispatch.

[Our Beiping Office, 18th Dispatch] After Zhang Junmai's two representatives arrived in Beiping, Ye Duzhuang went directly from the airport to Yenching University to discuss with Zhang Dongsheng. Sun Baogang entered the city to discuss with Hu Haimen and others.

[Our Nanjing Office, 18th Dispatch] It is heard that the government can largely agree to the four points proposed by Zhang Junmai. Zhang Junmai was very busy today. Lei Zhen visited him at 9:00 AM, Zhang Qun visited him at 11:00 AM, Lei visited him again at 4:00 PM, Shao Lizi also visited him at 5:00 PM, and at 7:00 PM he attended a dinner hosted by Chen Cheng and Wang Shijie. Democratic Socialist Party members Sun Baogang and Ye Duyi flew to Beiping on the morning of the 18th and will return to Nanjing soon. The party's submission of the National Assembly list can be decided in the near future.

[Our Nanjing Office, 18th Dispatch] Chen Cheng and Wang Shijie hosted guests at No. 8 Putuo Road at 7:00 PM on the 18th, including Zhang Jia'ao, Zhang Jun, Chuan Sinian, Fan Yushui, Zhou Gengsheng, Gao Yihan, Xiao Yishan, Miao Jiaming, Zhang Junmai, Zuo Shunsheng, Zeng Qi, Chen Qitian, Gu Yuxiu, Zhang Bojin, and Tong Guanxian. They had dinner and talked until they dispersed one after another at about 9:00 PM.

[Our Nanjing Office, 18th Dispatch] The Democratic League held an internal meeting at 9:00 AM on the 18th. In the afternoon, Shao Lizi visited Luo Longji and others, and at 6:30 PM, Luo Longji and Zhang Bojun visited Zhou Enlai.

### CCP May Agree to 13 Government Committee Seats

[Our Nanjing Office, 18th Dispatch] The reorganization of the Government Committee is under discussion. As for the issue of Government Committee seats, the CCP has abandoned its previous insistence on 14 seats and may agree to the government's suggestion of 13 seats. Seats for the CCP and the Democratic League will be reserved. Someone stated: If Zhang Junmai participates, he will also be a member of the Democratic League. The government is also considering reorganizing the Executive Yuan.

### Parachute Brigade Headquarters Statement: No Transfers of Troops

[Our Suzhou Office, 18th Dispatch] Major General Ma Shigong, Commander of the Parachute Brigade, issued the following important statement at noon on the 18th: The only parachute unit in China is the Parachute Brigade, commanded by me. The current troop strength is entirely stationed along the Nanjing-Shanghai line, and a portion is currently concentrated in Nanjing for training. There have been no transfers. The rumor that they have been concentrated near the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border region is completely absurd. The Communist Party's intention in spreading this news is purely to emphasize the atmosphere of war and attempt to cover up the impropriety of its war preparations, which is intended to confuse the world.

### Niu Yongjian Arrives in Shenyang

[Our Shenyang Office, 18th Dispatch] Niu Yongjian and his wife flew to Shenyang at noon on the 18th and plan to stay here for five or six days. He will begin inspecting party affairs on the 19th and then go to Changchun and Yongji.

### Implementation of Comprehensive Import Control: Industry to Receive Protection. Wang Yunwu Supplements Import and Export Control Opinions

[Our Nanjing Office, 18th Dispatch] After Song Ziwen issued a statement on import and export controls, Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Yunwu added on the 17th: Import control is necessary at present and is also a unanimous request from China's nascent industrial and commercial sectors. This time, all imports will be comprehensively controlled. Among them, it is stipulated that machinery and industrial equipment should be given preferential treatment, while other imports will be stricter than before. I believe that the government can protect industry from now on, and international allies will certainly understand our actions. After import control, the volume of imports may not necessarily decrease, but it will be mostly for what we need. The government should strengthen transportation and facilitate these necessities. However, it is reasonable to strictly control those that are harmful to the nation. Only in this way can we cultivate our industry and increase production. The measures announced this time are very good, but they still need to be supplemented and carefully studied in implementation.

### National Assembly Preparatory Meeting Anecdotes

— Our Reporter Zhang Ming

Chairman Chiang's appearance at the venue as a National Representative was a surprise to everyone. He quietly entered and sat in seat number one, which he had drawn. Five minutes later, Madame Chiang arrived in a light coffee-colored sea tiger velvet coat and sat in seat number two, next to the Chairman and Minister Bai.

As soon as Minister Bai entered the venue, he said to reporters: You have a lot of news to report. Chen Lifu and a Tibetan representative in lama attire entered the venue together, talking as they walked. Wang Shijie was very interested in the voting machine and stood there for several minutes, looking up at it. At 11:10, Shao Lizi left the meeting, and at 11:13, Wang Shijie left. Sensitive reporters immediately guessed the reason why the two representatives of the Political Consultative Conference left one after another. However, when the reporter went to the National Political Council during the break, he saw Shao renovating old envelopes in the office.

By 11:00, the meeting was still nowhere near resolution. One representative stood up and spoke without going through the initial procedures of civil rights, loudly urging the chairman to pay attention to controlling the time. Unexpectedly, another representative then said in an even louder voice: "Even if it takes until tomorrow, we still have to discuss it. We cannot limit it by time." The venue immediately became chaotic.

Presidents Dai and Yu of the two academies both wore long gowns and mandarin jackets. President Dai sat upright, deep in thought, while President Yu kept flipping through the agenda and handbook, as well as newspapers.

Chen Guofu wore a Zhongshan suit, perhaps because of his cough, and had a wool scarf around his neck. He constantly paid attention to the movements of the journalists. Someone said: "Guofu is studying the attitude and interviewing skills of young reporters again."

The representatives' lounge was crowded with people during the break, and journalists wove in and out like shuttles, forming a news network.

Female representatives Zhuang Jing and Chen Yiyun stood together, both wearing dark green woolen cheongsams, but Chen was thin and Zhuang was plump, making for a strong contrast.

Many of those who spoke today spoke Sichuan dialect. None of the female representatives spoke, but after the meeting, Liu Hengjing repeatedly said to reporters: "Women suffer losses. I originally wanted to speak, but when everyone was shaking the fundamental principles of this draft, it was even harder for me to speak."

Zhang Daofan spoke most logically and clearly, attracting the attention of the entire venue.

The journalists who were observing had arrived at the venue around 8:00 AM to occupy seats. By the time the meeting began, the seats were already gone, and those who arrived later naturally had to stand there as onlookers. Youth Party representative Zeng Qi shook hands everywhere in the venue.

On the day that the government announced the revised Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade, Wang Yunwu became the target of interviews, but he did not say much.

Wu Tiecheng had just returned to Nanjing from Shanghai today and appeared at the venue before 10:00 AM, attracting much attention.

Li Zongren's seat was on the side, and because he was relatively small, many people ignored him. Although he had three shining general stars, the reporters still recognized his identity.

By the time the meeting adjourned, it was 12:35 PM, and everyone was hungry. All that could be heard was the conference staff reporting where representatives and journalists were being entertained.

Chairman Shang and his wife left during the break after 11:15. However, before Madame left, she was surrounded by journalists asking for her autograph. Madame, in her capacity as a National Representative, signed for the general public.

Chairman Sun Ke coughed dryly every time he spoke, and he sat in the chairman's reclining chair, consulting documents, just like in the Legislative Yuan.

When Sun Ke was nominated through the microphone during the election of the chairman, Chairman Sun and Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng happened to enter the venue, and a burst of welcome applause erupted like spring thunder.

Chairman Chiang was in his seat and used a 51-type Parker pen to take notes on the speeches of the representatives. At 11:15, he handed in a note suggesting a five-minute break.

After the break, Chairman Chiang left. Minister Bai sat alone quietly, frequently looking at his watch, and at 12:00, he grabbed his briefcase and left in a hurry. Representative Xie Dizhong of the Miao people spoke with the most passionate emotion.

Although Zhang Qun had registered, he did not attend, presumably busy with negotiations again.

### Allied Industrial Equipment Compensation from Japan: China to Receive the Majority. US Decides to Expedite Distribution of Japanese Reparations, Ship Shortage Causes Transportation Problems

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 18th Special Dispatch] According to Ray Dai, Chief of the Industry and Compensation Section of the Economic and Industrial Group of the Allied Headquarters, China will receive the majority of the industrial equipment and machinery from Japan as compensation, but the transport of such compensation goods to China will be a long-term matter. Months ago, the Chinese government requested the issuance of various urgently needed equipment and machinery for the reconstruction and rehabilitation of areas destroyed by the Japanese army during the war. However, the Allied Headquarters authorities cannot agree to China's request without the consent of the Far Eastern Commission in Washington. A considerable amount of materials suitable for China's special purposes should have been shipped from Japan since January of this year as compensation. The Far Eastern Commission's delay in distributing Japanese reparations is due to the Soviet Union's refusal to participate in the compensation conference convened in August of this year. Not only the Chinese government, but also other allies and the Allied Headquarters itself, are eager to clarify the relevant issues and take action regarding Japanese reparations. The Allied Headquarters is particularly concerned about this, because the long-term suspension of the matter of Japanese factories that can be considered exempt from compensation will delay industrial recovery and indirectly prolong the occupation period. Currently, regardless of whether the Soviet Union participates in the discussions or not, the recent decision by the United States to proceed with the distribution of Japanese reparations may lead to decisive action. Pauley's report to President Truman, suggesting that the United States immediately begin collecting Japanese reparations, may expedite the matter; however, the word "immediately" is somewhat misleading, as collecting various material reparations from Japan is an extraordinarily complex issue. Various small items, such as machine tools, generators, and other independent units of machinery, can be packed and shipped within weeks, but disassembling an entire factory may take months. Inventories of various machine tools and other small items have recently been created, and status reports on various factories and departments are being prepared, but it is quite difficult to find power plants and factories for special purposes that meet the requirements of the various Allied countries. The Allied Headquarters authorities are already worried about the impact of the removal of compensation goods on the Japanese economy. Protecting and packing the various machines to be removed also requires a huge amount of wood, nails, and grease. These few items alone represent a huge expenditure. Months ago, officials from the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry estimated that the wood needed to package the compensation goods was almost equal to the wood needed for housing construction throughout Japan. The domestic transportation plan in Japan is also extremely large. How to transport the compensation goods out of Japan has also become a problem. Japan's current transportation capacity is insufficient to transport the compensation goods. Most of the US Liberty ships lent to the Japanese government for repatriating Japanese people have also been returned to the United States. Transportation will be a particularly big problem for China, as China has limited ships, while the total amount of machinery shipped from Japan is very large.

### Exchange Ceremony of Ratification Instruments of China-Sweden New Treaty Held Yesterday, Completed in Three Minutes

[Our Nanjing Office, 18th Dispatch] The exchange ceremony of ratification instruments of the new China-Sweden Treaty was held at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 2:00 PM on the 18th. At about 2:00 PM, the Swedish Ambassador to China, Yale, and the Commercial Secretary, Long Haide, arrived at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where they were received by Wang Jizheng, Chief of the Protocol Department, and escorted to the reception room on the second floor for a brief rest. Then, Foreign Minister Wang, Vice Ministers Gan Naiguang, Wang Huacheng, Ye Gongchao, Chen Xiongfei, and Chen Mingchi arrived. Foreign Minister Wang shook hands with Ambassador Yale and greeted him, happily saying: "It's a very nice day today!" Then, they began to exchange signatures on the two ratified red books placed on the long table in the pre-arranged room. Suddenly, the mercury lamps lit up brightly, and photographers scrambled for shots. Foreign Minister Wang signed his name in Chinese and English with a brush and a fountain pen, while Yale signed his Swedish name with a fountain pen. After both signed and affixed rubber seals, they raised champagne glasses to congratulate each other. The entire ceremony was completed within three minutes. Yale chatted with Foreign Minister Wang for a while before leaving with one copy of the treaty at 2:20 PM. According to the provisions of Article 8 of the treaty between China and Sweden on the abolition of Swedish extraterritorial rights and other related privileges in China, which was signed in Chongqing on April 5, 1945, and ratified by the governments of both countries, the treaty shall enter into force from the date on which the two governments mutually notify each other of its ratification. The treaty had been approved and entered into force by the governments of both countries on July 20 of the same year. Today was the exchange of ratified treaty books, with two copies exchanged. After the exchange, Swedish Ambassador Yale met with reporters and made a speech, saying: The Swedish people respect China's lasting civilization, and the shipping line operates approximately once a month. There are also two companies operating the China-US route.

[Central News Agency, Xiamen, 18th] Following the closing of the Nanyang Overseas Chinese Economic Construction Company's promoters' meeting, the Standing Committee of the Preparatory Committee responsible for planning and carrying out concrete work held its first meeting this morning. It determined the personnel responsible for various groups and elected Hu Wenhu as the director of the Standing Committee by vote, with Wang Zhenxiang and Huang Chongji as his deputies, and He Baoren as the secretary-general.

### Chairman Cares About Northern Jiangsu's Recovery, Personally Orders Chairman Su to Reside in Huaiyin for Supervision

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 18th] It is reported that Chairman Chiang, recognizing that Northern Jiangsu is devastated after its recapture and that pacification and administrative affairs urgently need to be promoted for recovery, has personally ordered the Executive Yuan's Pacification Zone Political Affairs Committee to inform Chairman Wang of Jiangsu Province to reside permanently in Huaiyin to facilitate close supervision.

[Another Dispatch] The Executive Yuan's Pacification Zone Political Affairs Committee is scheduled to hold a meeting today at the Ministry of National Defense in Nanjing. Party, government, military, and civic groups from Jiangsu Province have gathered in Nanjing to participate. It is reported that the meeting will broadly discuss the coordination of military, political, and economic efforts in the recovered areas for pacification and will decide on concrete measures to stabilize rural areas, restore production, and gradually achieve recovery in the shortest possible time. Regarding the exemption from taxes and levies in the counties of Northern Jiangsu, subsidies for county and township administrative expenses will also be decided to prevent the occurrence of apportionment and increase the burden on the people.

[Another Dispatch] Chairman Wang of Jiangsu Province, concerned about the disaster situation in the harvest areas of Northern Jiangsu, has recently decided to allocate 4 million to 6 million yuan per county for disaster relief. Chairman Wang has now arrived in Nanjing from Xuzhou and is expected to return to the province within two or three days.

[Another Dispatch] To strengthen the administrative efficiency of the recovered areas and adapt to current needs, the provincial government will replace county magistrates in Jiangnan who are incompetent or have poor performance in stages. This will be discussed and decided at a provincial government meeting after Chairman Wang Maogong returns to the province.

[Our Yangzhou Dispatch, 18th] The Ding embankment of the Grand Canal, from Jiangdu to Tianchang, has seen improving order after the garrison troops led by Brigade Commander Liang cleared the area and assisted the local government in vigorously implementing pacification. The reorganization of the baojia system is underway, and increasing numbers of refugees are returning home.

### Living Expenses of Family Members of Traitors

New Interpretation by Counselor of the Judicial Yuan

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] Regarding the issue of appropriately retaining living expenses for family members of traitors, since the publication of Interpretation No. 3213 of the Judicial Yuan, it has been generally considered too abstract, and it is feared that difficulties will arise during handling. A reporter visited Counselor Ge of the Judicial Yuan regarding this matter, who said: The situations in various places are different, and individual family circumstances also vary. Therefore, it is difficult to make a definitive provision for the living expenses of family members of traitors. However, family members of traitors who have independent abilities and can support themselves will not be considered for retention. Therefore, although there are no rigid regulations, handling will not be as difficult as imagined. As for the issue of debt repayment for traitors, the reason for stipulating that the executing agency is not responsible for clearing debts is to limit the fraudulent collection of debts. Although this is unfair to a small number of creditors, it is necessary to protect the general interest.

### Increasingly Fast Land and Air Transportation Between Nanjing-Shanghai and the Northwest; Direct Train Service from Xuzhou to Xi'an Resumes

[Our Xi'an Dispatch, 17th] The direct train service between Xuzhou and Xi'an on the Longhai Railway, which had been suspended for nearly ten years, has recently resumed with a newly compiled train, the "Yellow River," with an actual travel time of only twenty-six hours. People here are very excited. It is generally believed that if the train does not stop overnight in Kaifeng and connects with train schedules to Pukou and Shanghai in Xuzhou, the journey between Shanghai and Xi'an could be shortened to three days, and the "Yellow River" train could be increased from once a week to twice a week. Passenger and freight transportation for the five provinces of Jiangsu, Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Southern Shanxi, as well as postal services, will greatly benefit. However, the railway still sells tickets in sections along the line, and each transfer provides an opportunity for black market ticket activity, with prices rising to more than double.

Furthermore, air transportation between Xi'an and Nanjing-Shanghai has recently become increasingly smooth. However, although the air journey is only six or seven hours, "aviation" mail rarely arrives within 100 hours, and newspapers sent by airmail sometimes take seven days, which urgently needs improvement by the post office.

Transportation between Lanzhou and Xi'an still relies on highway bus transport. Recently, the number of buses has increased to daily departures in both directions, scheduled to arrive in four days, but if there are no breakdowns along the way, a round trip can be made within a week.

### Railway Transportation Inspection Group Arrives in Hankou from Zhengzhou Yesterday

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 18th] The national railway transportation inspection group, led by Jin Shixuan, arrived in Hankou from Zhengzhou yesterday. Starting today, they will divide and inspect various departments of the Pinghan Railway Bureau, and then proceed along the Yuehan Railway to Hengyang, Guangzhou, and Kowloon for work, before flying from Kowloon to Shanghai and then to Hangzhou for inspection.

### Guangdong Rushes to Repair the Circum-Hainan Highway

### Representative of the Bank of Taiwan Handles Foreign Exchange Settlement Matters for Seven Banks in Shanghai; Implementation to Begin Upon Exchange of Official Correspondence

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 18th] The Bank of Taiwan has recently reached an agreement with the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Shanghai Bank, HSBC, Mercantile Bank, Citibank, and Chase Bank in Shanghai, whereby the Bank of Taiwan will represent the above seven banks in handling foreign exchange settlement certificates and related matters for Taiwan. Implementation will begin upon the exchange of official correspondence. Yan Jiagan, Director of the Finance Department of Taiwan Province, stated that in the past, export goods from Taiwan Province had to go through foreign exchange settlement procedures in Shanghai, which was inconvenient. In the future, export goods will no longer need to be transshipped through Shanghai and can be directly shipped to foreign countries, including Hong Kong and Macau. The trade in products from Taiwan Province will enter a new stage. He also stated that foreign cargo ships can conveniently pass through Taiwan to load goods, but the minimum amount of export cargo that can be loaded each time must be at least 500 tons for foreign ships to be willing to come to Taiwan.

### Thirty Young Chinese Naval Personnel Trained on British Ships in the Mediterranean; Chairman Chiang's Grandnephew Among Them

[Reuters, Malta, 18th] About thirty young Chinese naval soldiers who volunteered to join the Royal Navy before Japan's surrender are currently serving on the British First Cruiser Squadron flagship, HMS Mauritius. They are aged between twenty and twenty-one and have previously received a year of training at coastal base fleets in Plymouth and Carson, England. They are now undergoing six months of ocean-going fleet training. Everyone is now a second-class gunner. Many suffered from seasickness when they first encountered ocean life, with only four being spared. The food and treatment on board are exactly the same as for other soldiers. They are divided into three groups during work and have not yet been assigned night guard duty. The thirty live together in a room at the front of HMS Mauritius, and British Navy Sergeant Dunstable is responsible for liaison and explaining various issues to them. These Chinese youths are of excellent character, never drink alcohol, and only four smoke. Perhaps because they know that the training period is only eighteen months, they are all very diligent in their work. One of them, Chiang Tongfu (transliteration), is Chairman Chiang's grandnephew.

### Editorial: New Trends in the International Situation

Perhaps due to the convening of the National Assembly, the general public's attention seems to be focused on domestic affairs. However, in recent days, a new trend in the international situation cannot be ignored. This new trend is manifested in two different situations. First, as a result of the US elections, the Republican Party, known as right-leaning, holds a controlling majority in the US Congress. Second, there is a rise of left-wing political groups in Europe. The rise of left-wing political groups in Europe is manifested in two different situations: (1) As a result of the French general election, the Communist Party has once again become the leading party in the Fourth Republic; (2) Signs of division within the British Labour Party—this is manifested in dozens of British Labour MPs expressing disagreement with the government's foreign policy in the House of Commons and demanding revisions. This new trend in the international situation is worth our attention.

This new trend in the international situation manifests in two different forms: the so-called right-leaning Republican Party gaining power in the United States, and the rise of left-wing groups in Europe. However, if we investigate further, although the forms or appearances of this trend are different, the factors that contribute to it are the same. What are these contributing factors? It is the expansion of Soviet power. Since the surrender of the Nazis and the cessation of the European war, Soviet power has actively expanded into Europe. It goes without saying that the Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, which were independent countries before the war, have now been incorporated into Soviet territory. Poland, Romania, Hungary, Yugoslavia, and even Czechoslovakia have now effectively become vassals of the Soviet Union. In defeated Germany, the Soviet occupation zone is not only larger in area than the British, American, and French occupation zones, but also psychologically the heart of Germany for the German people. Furthermore, throughout the world, from the Dardanelles to distant places, including the Indian Ocean coast of Africa, the Kuril Islands in the North Pacific, and even the desolate Antarctic, the Soviet Union is demonstrating its power. What humanity has discovered from the Second World War is the malignant expansion of Soviet power. Even the United States, which supplied the Soviet Union with Lend-Lease materials, enabling it to defeat Nazi Germany, feels difficult to cope with in this situation. Appeasement towards the Soviet Union? This ultimately compromises the dignity of the United States. Therefore, despite the existence of figures like Wallace who advocate appeasement towards the Soviet Union, American public opinion generally believes that it is unacceptable. Taking a tough stance towards the Soviet Union? The current situation of the United States does not permit it. This is why the policy of Byrnes is hard within the soft, and soft within the hard.

Because the United States does not have a firm policy towards the Soviet Union, the result is a further expansion of Soviet power. Europeans are particularly sensitive to this situation, especially left-wing parties such as the Communist Party, which originally had a close relationship with Moscow. Taking advantage of the people's fear of the Soviet Union and their disappointment with the United States, the Communist Party and left-wing political groups have a great opportunity to assert themselves. This is why the Communist Party re-emerged in the recent French general election and became the leading party in France. This is also why the ruling Labour Party in Britain is showing signs of division. Speaking of Britain, its Labour Party originally had a clear distinction from left-wing political parties on the European continent. Socialism in Britain was originally just a pastime for the intellectual class, and it did not have the left-leaning color of the continent. Although trade unions and other groups later joined, their consistent style was legal and orderly competition, unlike the tendency of continental socialism towards riots. Since the Labour Party won the general election and formed a government, it has adhered to this conservative tradition. In the situation of US-Soviet rivalry, it has adopted a relatively pro-US policy. Because the adoption of this policy conforms to the conditions of the Labour Party and also conforms to the conditions of Britain. However, for a year, the expansion of Soviet power has continued as before, which has aroused the dissatisfaction of a small number of young and passionate Labour MPs, resulting in a new isolationism that is similar to appeasement towards the Soviet Union. Now that the Attlee government has therefore requested a vote of confidence, it can be said with certainty that it will not receive the support of a majority of British Labour MPs.

Because the current US government does not have a firm policy towards the Soviet Union, and at the same time, does not have policies in various parts of the world and within the United States, the result is reflected in the success of the Republican Party in the US election. Although both the Republican and Democratic parties claim that the results of this election have no impact on US foreign policy. However, we must understand that the reason why this election has no direct impact on US foreign policy is not because the Republican Party has any goodwill towards the Democratic Party; it is because the Democratic Party still holds the power of the administration. Although the American people have expressed their aversion to the Democratic Party, the Republican Party has no right to form a government due to constitutional provisions. The Republican Party's foreign policy is naturally more realistic than that of the Democratic Party. Taking China as an example, during the era of Democratic Party rule, there could be the Lansing-Ishii Agreement in the past, and the Yalta Agreement later on; while in the era of the Republican Party, we saw the Washington Conference and the agreement on Chinese tariff autonomy. The Republican Party is famous for its "big stick" policy. Although this election gave them control of Congress, it did not give them the power of the administration; but due to the results of this election, it may cause the government of President Truman to adopt a firmer stance on foreign policy.

Therefore, no matter which aspect we look at, although the forms presented by the current new international trend are different, their essence is the same, that is, how to deal with the continued expansion of Soviet power. Our country's relationship with the Soviet Union is of utmost importance. The length of the Sino-Soviet border is unparalleled in the world. We should cherish the land friendship of the Soviet Union. Then, how will we deal with the Soviet Union? This is indeed worthy of our serious consideration.

### Sanmen Bay to be Developed; Inspection Group and Construction Committee to be Established First

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch] The Zhejiang Provincial Government plans to develop coastal reclamation. Regarding the proposal to develop Sanmen Bay, the Provincial Assembly unanimously resolved to request the Provincial Government to quickly make plans. There has also been a long-standing debate on whether to request the establishment of a commercial port in the bay. According to experts, the geographical conditions of the port are insufficient. The future development goals should adopt three methods: (1) improve fisheries, (2) reclaim wasteland, and (3) improve salt production. The Department of Civil Affairs and Construction has repeatedly urged by the Provincial Assembly to handle the matter and has recently conducted preliminary consultations. As a result, the Department of Construction has drafted the following two measures: (1) organize an inspection group of Sanmen Bay, inviting experts to form it, and it must depart soon; (2) organize a Sanmen Bay Construction Committee, responsible for regular planning, investigation, and other work. The above measures have been approved by Chairman Shen. Commissioner Gong Peicheng is responsible for the inspection group.

### Decline in Business in Wujin; Three Cloth Stores Close Down

[Our Wujin Dispatch] Business in Wujin has been very sluggish for the past six months. Before the Mid-Autumn Festival, there were rumors that many businesses were closing, but they struggled through. Although there were a few, such as Yu Kang Silk and Cloth Store, they were in the minority. However, in the past ten days, three cloth stores have successively closed down, attracting social attention. The first to declare bankruptcy was Yuanhetai Cloth Store on Fuzhi Street, with total losses reaching 30 million yuan. Shareholders Liu Bingsheng, Cheng Bingcheng, and Liu Wensheng came forward to handle the matter and settled by paying 60% of the debt. On the 14th and 15th, Dingxin and Dafeng Cloth Stores in Xiyingli also suddenly announced their closure. It is reported that Dingxin's total losses exceeded 80 million yuan. The manager of the store, Ni Zhiming, on the morning of the day before the closure (the 13th), even used a payment receipt from the Silk Industry Bank to purchase ten pieces of 20-count Six Crane yarn and fifty bolts of Blue Butterfly fine cloth from the Dacheng Yarn Factory in the county. He then hired a cart to transport the yarn and cloth in two trips. Unexpectedly, that afternoon, Dacheng suddenly received a phone call from the Silk Industry Bank notifying them that Dingxin's payment was a bounced check. The factory immediately sent someone to Dingxin to investigate. Manager Ni Zhiming had already fled, and the yarn was nowhere to be found. After a thorough investigation, it was discovered that Ni Zhiming had used other names to secretly store seven pieces of yarn at the residence of a Mr. Gu at No. 32 Zhouqian Lane. The police station was notified and went to retrieve the yarn, recovering all seven pieces. The rest is still under investigation. People in society generally believe that this is close to fraud, arbitrary bankruptcy, and an attempt to profit personally. They hope that the authorities will pay attention to it.

### Zhejiang Fishing

First Catch is Abundant

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 18th] The winter fishing season has arrived. Zhejiang fishermen have set out for the first time. According to a telegram from the County Magistrate of Dinghai to Chairman Zhu, the first catch was very large. The coast is peaceful, and there have been no disasters. However, in order to strengthen winter defenses and ensure the peak fishing season after December, the Dinghai Water Police Bureau has sent personnel to Shanghai to purchase five landing craft, costing approximately 60 million yuan. Then, winter coastal defense can be worry-free.

### Yangzhou City

Planning to Build Roads

[Our Yangzhou Dispatch] The Jiangdu County Government, recognizing that Yangzhou is a distribution center for merchants from dozens of counties in northern Jiangsu and, in terms of geographical location, is a springboard for southern and northern Jiangsu, separated from the provincial capital Zhenjiang by only a river, feels that the existing streets in the city are too narrow. Not only are there frequent congestion problems for pedestrians and vehicles, but when it rains, vehicles splash mud everywhere, causing suffering to everyone. This month, there is a plan to build roads in the city. On the 15th, the county government announced the above plan. There are five planned construction routes. Among them, the Jia-type route, which uses Yunsishi Street, Jiaochang Street, and Jimen Bridge as the standard, is more likely to be adopted because this route is the existing commercial and industrial center of Yangzhou. Furthermore, it has been found that the length of this route is two kilometers, and the total construction cost is estimated to be over 2 billion yuan.

### Jinan Embankment Breach Under Repair

[Our Zheng Yangguan Correspondent] The Jinan dike branch in Yingshang breached during the Yellow River floods, inundating Jiangkou, Yiwu, Xiaji, and over ten other townships. Now, with the water level gradually receding, the county government convened the Jinan Embankment Breach Restoration Committee on the 6th to prevent further flooding. It was decided to build a crescent-shaped embankment outside the breach, requiring 300 large stakes, 4,000 catties of firewood, 400 large sacks, 500 catties of hemp, 40 net rolls, and 59,500 cubic meters of earthwork. 2,600 workers were assigned proportionally to eight townships: Yiwu, Xiaqiao, Longji, Xieqiao, Donggucheng, Jiangkou, Ganluo, and Yejing. Construction commenced on the 15th and is expected to be completed by the 2nd of next month.

### Military Officer Corps - Ministry of National Defense Dispatches Inspectors

Yu Wen Arrives in Suzhou, Now Headed to Nanxun

[Our Suzhou Correspondent, 18th] To ensure proper placement of military officers from various heavy officer corps and to understand the conditions of garrisoned troops in various provinces and cities, the Ministry of National Defense has dispatched over 30 supervisory officers to inspect provinces and cities nationwide. Major General Yu Wen, Suzhou district supervisory officer, arrived in Suzhou on the morning of the 18th. When inspecting the Parachute Corps, our reporter happened to be present. Mr. Yu informed us that his primary task is to inspect the 29th Military Officer Corps, seeking a thorough understanding of their living conditions, personnel matters, and training. Furthermore, they plan to rigorously assess the capabilities of surplus officers. The central government intends to select outstanding personnel to supplement cadres and officers in various troops. Those of lesser ability will be selected based on their aptitude and willingness to participate in training courses in agriculture, fisheries, land administration, and other fields. If they prefer to transfer to agriculture, they may also be permitted to retire, to be recalled when the nation requires. We have learned that because the 29th Military Officer Corps has moved from Suzhou to Nanxun, Mr. Yu will depart on the 19th and engage in a longer period of work with the corps in Nanxun.

### Self-Defense Team Robbed in Zheng Yangguan Suburbs

[Our Zheng Yangguan Correspondent] To strengthen public security, the local authorities deployed the Third Self-Defense Platoon to Liuzikou (15 li west of Zheng Yangguan). On the 14th, dozens of bandits suddenly attacked the platoon headquarters at midnight. The sentries, caught off guard, were unable to respond effectively. Over 20 firearms were seized, and the platoon leader was abducted.

### Zhenjiang Commences Winter Defense

[Our Zhenjiang Correspondent] The Provincial Police Department, considering Zhenjiang's proximity to the capital and Shanghai, has formulated a winter defense plan to enhance winter security and ensure public order. It was issued to various branch bureaus and stations, and uniformly implemented from the 16th. Furthermore, the Provincial Security Command, noting that banditry in various parts of the province has not been completely eradicated, has ordered all districts, counties, cities, and security and water police forces to strengthen vigilance during the winter defense period and avoid negligence. The command recently telegraphed all counties to comply and issued a copy of the "Outline for Implementing Winter Defense in Various Districts, Counties, and Cities of This Province," ordering its conscientious implementation and reporting.

### Two Robbers of the Yongli Steamer Arrested - Once Escaped While Being Transported

[Our Suzhou Correspondent] On September 9th, the Yongli steamer, sailing from Songjiang to Suzhou, was robbed by armed bandits in the vicinity of Huangtiandang in Jiaozhi town, Suzhou territory, resulting in a loss of tens of millions of yuan. After months of pursuit by the Suzhou military and police authorities, a portion of the perpetrators and stolen goods were captured in Lanxi, Zhejiang. On the 16th, the Wudi Procuratorate welcomed them back to Suzhou. A brief account of the circumstances is as follows: There were five robbers involved in the case: Liu Cai, Mao Xiufa, Zhou Changfa, who are still at large, and Zhou Biao and Wang Zhenhua, who have been arrested. All are members of the Jiaozhi Self-Defense Team. On that day, they were ordered to collect rent in Xietang, carrying a submachine gun, a Mauser pistol, and two short guns. While traveling approximately two li from Xietang, they encountered the Yongli steamer and opened fire, forcing it to stop. They boarded the ship and robbed it, sparing no jewelry or clothing of male or female passengers. After looting, they fled towards Jiangxi. Later, the Jiaozhi Self-Defense Squad Leader, Hu De, discovered their trail and led his troops to track them down to the Lanxi Railway Station in Zhejiang, where they intercepted the two robbers, Zhou Biao and Wang Zhenhua, and two suitcases of stolen goods. They were temporarily detained at the Lanxi District Court. Upon receiving the report, the Wudi Court dispatched judicial police to escort them back. However, when the train arrived at the Zhuang station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, at night, Zhou and Wang took advantage of the darkness and jumped off the train in an attempt to escape. The judicial police discovered this and gave chase. After a thrilling chase between police and robbers, they were recaptured at dawn in a haystack in a farmhouse more than ten li from the station. At 5:00 PM on the 16th, they were escorted back to Suzhou. After interrogation by the prosecutor, they were ordered to be detained, and the pursuit of the remaining perpetrators was ordered.

### Black Terror in Quzhou - Plague-like Cases Discovered in the City - People Fear the Plague on Streets and Alleys

[Our Quzhou Express News] The black terror that once gripped hearts and minds has returned to Quzhou. Recently, plague-like cases have been discovered in the city. In just five days, a twelve-year-old surnamed Zhou on Nanshi Street, a ten-year-old surnamed Fan at No. 21 Tongjia Lane, and a young man of unknown surname at the entrance of Wusheng Lane have all died after contracting the disease. Rats recently died at the Zhouhuang Temple, and the temple caretaker's child fell ill and died on the same day. The deceased first experienced chills, followed by high fever, vomiting, and swelling of the lymph nodes in the armpits and other areas, symptoms highly similar to the plague. As the news spread, people on the streets and in the alleys were all talking about the plague and fearing it. Upon learning of this, the authorities convened an emergency epidemic prevention meeting on the 11th and decided on several emergency countermeasures: (1) Conduct household censuses to prevent people from concealing those afflicted with the disease, (2) Establish isolation hospitals, (3) Establish an epidemic prevention committee. The epidemic prevention committee was established on the 13th, but medical resources are severely lacking.

### Allocation of Goods Needs to Be Practical

We, the humble people, have suffered physically and mentally throughout the eight years of the War of Resistance. Although we could not fight the enemy on the front lines, we have steadfastly maintained our positions and worked without slackening. After the victory last autumn, we returned to Shanghai, and for the past year, our lives have been threatened. We have passively accepted our fate, waiting patiently for the government to adjust our treatment. Two months ago, the authorities, out of concern for public educators, established the Goods Allocation Office. The intention was good, and we were deeply grateful. Unexpectedly, we have already experienced great difficulty in the initial allocation of food boxes. Recently, we were again allocated one yard of melton cloth, but the selling price exceeded the retail price of the China Textile Corporation (as reported in other newspapers yesterday). The strangest thing is that when we went to the so-called "Zhongxing Military Uniform Factory" to have it measured, upon arriving at the location (No. 17 Fuchang Lane, Xizang Road, Edward Road), there were only three people sitting in the side room (which was borrowed from someone else's house). The measurements were extremely unclear. When asked how many days it would take to complete the work and whether the remaining material could be returned, the answer was: "There is no fixed date, the sewing fee is only 30,000 yuan, and the remaining material must cover the loss of the sewing fee and cannot be returned." Since we have already suffered from the initial allocation of food boxes, we cannot help but hesitate. We hope that the Allocation Office will pay attention to the interests of public educators and correct the following three points:

(1) The contractor should sincerely serve the public. (2) A deadline should be set for garment completion. (3) The cloth should be negotiated with the manufacturer to reduce the wholesale price and refund the balance (Wang Guoliang)

### Many Unemployed Become Petty Thieves

Recently, burglaries and break-ins have been occurring frequently in the alleys and neighborhoods of northern Shanghai. A few days ago, my neighbor in the alley was robbed, and unfortunately, my own home was also stolen from yesterday. Clothes, miscellaneous items, water bottles, copper pendants, lead buckets, and kerosene stoves were all taken. Although the loss is small, the cost of replacing them is considerable. In the current economic downturn and with so many unemployed, jobless vagrants are forced into theft to survive, and residents cannot sleep peacefully at night. I hope that the police authorities in the northern district will increase patrols in the dark, quiet alleys at night and pay close attention to pedestrians who appear flustered and are carrying packages. At the same time, I also hope that residents of the northern district will close their front and back doors early in the evening and inspect them again before going to bed. If there is any noise late at night, they should get up and observe. Those with locks installed on their alley gates should close them early in the evening or leave only a small door for one person to enter and exit. By being vigilant and defending ourselves, we can curb the theft. (Yushi)

### Huainan Coal Mine Railway - Doing Its Best in the Cracks

[Our Hefei Correspondent] I arrived at Jiulonggang Station, the location of the Huainan Coal Mine Railway Bureau, on a freight train on the evening of the 11th. In the dark night, the red glow of the coal coking furnace in the mining area soared into the sky, and flames and smoke spewed from the chimney. On the 12th, I visited the Tianjia'an Power Plant. Under the leadership of Mr. Li Rongbao, the head of the electrical engineering section, who "came from electrical engineering (self-taught)," the 2,000-kilowatt generator roared and turned, supplying power to the mining area with a diameter of ten kilometers for coal mining. A new generator is waiting to be installed, which will double the power supply after completion. The old power plant is busy dismantling and repairing the generator, and the sound of technicians chiseling and excavating the rusty turbine blades is incessant.

I then went to the three main production areas of the Huainan Coal Mine. Under the guidance of engineer Zhang Youxian, the hoists in the mine shafts rose and fell frequently, fully loaded with coal rising out of the shaft. The daily coal production reached 1,800 tons. The wall of the new No. 3 well in the West Mine has reached a depth of 200 meters underground. In two years, this well can produce 2,000 tons per day. The East Mine factory has 18 coking furnaces, which use the Pingxiang Yu's method of coking, producing 300 tons per month to supply the sand-casting factories in Beijing and Shanghai. The mine bureau has nearly 10,000 workers, who live with their families in 3,000 workshops.

On the 13th, I visited the Railway Bureau, led by Deputy Director Ning Shufan. Currently, the railway bureau extends 88 kilometers from Bengbu through Shuijiahu to Tianjia'an. Among them, the 26-kilometer section from Tianshui is the old Huainan Railway, and the Yongbeng section was built by the Japanese army and repaired for traffic on June 1st of this year. The entire line has 15 locomotives, over 200 passenger, freight, and coal cars. There are two passenger and freight trains running daily between Tianbeng and two coal trains running between Pukou and Tianjia'an daily, transporting 1,500 tons of coal and coke. Sometimes, coal trucks still need to cross the Yangtze River to Wuxi to supply coal to the Qishuyan Power Plant. The Jiulonggang Machine Factory, which belongs to the Railway Bureau, is headed by Liu Xinmin. It can repair two locomotives at the same time. Using waste materials abandoned by the Japanese, it has manufactured two passenger cars and twenty freight cars. The Equipment Depot, where Director Lu Fengshan of the Mechanical Affairs Department received piles of iron scrap abandoned by the Japanese, has now been organized into an orderly material warehouse. The equipment of the factory can be said to be complete, but it is eager to supplement a 50-ton crane as a giant arm for hoisting and repairing locomotives. The Engineering Department is planning the 188-kilometer track restoration project from Shuijiahu to Yuxikou. Director Li Jingshu, when mentioning the track restoration, had a particularly radiant look in his eyes. It is estimated that five kilometers of track will be laid per day, and the widest Zhugao River bridge will be built, etc. Full line traffic can be guaranteed in six months. After this line is opened to traffic, it will not only provide a Yangtze River export for Huainan coal sales, but also provide a cheap export route for grain, cotton, tobacco, and other products from the fertile central Anhui villages along the 300-kilometer route. It is currently hoped that the steel rails, sleepers, and bridges approved by the Ministry of Communications will arrive soon.

I then visited the employee welfare facilities. The hospital is headed by Director Wang Zhizhong. The dental equipment rivals that of Beijing and Shanghai. There are currently 20 beds. Surgical operations can be performed for appendectomies and complicated deliveries. A worker from Yi Chaohao had his bladder and urethra crushed by a train in the fog, and his life was in danger, but he was saved by surgery and is currently being treated. The hospital had 100 beds before the war and plans to restore 50 beds first. It is hoped that the Executive Yuan can allocate equipment and medicines, and an X-ray machine is urgently needed. The commercial center has departments for haircutting, laundry, sewing, and photography, with fees lower than the market price. There is a primary school with over 1,300 students, and a first-year junior high school and a Datong branch school.

The employees of the Railway Bureau all work above ground, and their physique, clothing, and spirit are very full. The employees of the Mine Bureau work hard 300 meters below the surface, sacrificing their own lives and health for the light of Beijing and Shanghai, resulting in a miserable scene in the workshop area. The total number of employees in the Railway and Mine Bureaus is 13,000. In addition to producing 50,000 tons of coal per day, transporting 100,000 tons of coal and cargo, and carrying 200,000 passengers, they are also busy installing new generators, flour mills, and new mine shafts. The work is in full swing, and everyone is immersed in practical work. Although the salaries of staff and workers are higher than those of civil servants, and they have housing and free electricity and coal supply, they have been able to remain honest and self-disciplined since the takeover, and their lives are simple. Therefore, they can contribute every drop to the public. And because they are located in the gap between northeastern Anhui and the Dabie Mountains, they are constantly threatened by the communist forces that run east and west, and they further develop the spirit of using the power grid bunkers to protect the mine and the road. In September, led by two geological experts, Xie Jiarong and Chai Dengbang, they explored a new coal-bearing stratum at Xinzhuangzi, Fengtai, 17 kilometers from Jiulonggang. A 120-meter drill hole found four layers of coal, totaling more than six meters thick, giving Huainan Mine a new national base and further increasing the future prospects of the Mine Road.

### Labor Party Splinter Faction Sparks a Storm - British House of Commons Debates Foreign Policy - Prime Minister Attlee Attends to Defend

[Our Special Correspondent, London, 18th] The British House of Commons held a heated debate today on whether British foreign policy should be amended. Prime Minister Attlee stated in his speech that the time has come to vote on amending foreign policy. Mr. Attlee added that since all the riots occurred, several thousand people have died and 14,000 have been injured. At the time of reporting, the debate on amending foreign policy is still ongoing.

[United Press, London, 17th] When the House of Commons meets tomorrow to discuss the amendment to foreign policy proposed by the "rebellious" members of the Labor Party, the United States may become the target of public criticism. A portion of the rebel faction, advocating an independent socialist policy, is expected to criticize the United States with the same intensity that the U.S. Congress criticized Britain when discussing loans to Britain. "The Observer" newspaper summarized the concerns of the rebel faction, stating that they believe that Britain's close economic ties with the United States will make it difficult for Britain to escape the inevitable trend of capitalism, from prosperity to decline. If Britain is closely linked with the United States in politics and diplomacy, it will lead to the division of the world into two major blocs, which will inevitably lead to war. Most Labor Party members feel that the rise of the Republican Party in the United States is equivalent to the rise of big business. Among the Labor Party members who have been the most critical of Bevin's foreign policy, Dugu delivered a speech today, predicting tomorrow's debate. It is said that "ignorant and small-minded Americans are preaching another war. I want to save the Soviet Union from communism, but the situation across the Atlantic is no less bad, or at least very bad." Another rebel leader stated that the British foreign policy now supported by Churchill is drifting with the tide and is worthless. He and other like-minded people want Britain to stand alone in international affairs and disassociate itself from the United States. Most observers believe that if the rebel members continue to criticize, Prime Minister Attlee will demand a vote of confidence, which he will certainly receive with an overwhelming majority.

### Two International Conferences in New York - Now Entering a Tense Stage - Five Major Powers Meet to Discuss Limiting the Use of the Veto - The German Question Will Be Included on the Agenda of the Foreign Ministers' Meeting

[Our Special Correspondent, New York, 18th] At 11:00 a.m. today, the five powers met to seek an agreement on the issue of limiting the veto power. Prior to that, the four foreign ministers had discussed the Trieste issue, but to date, the results of the negotiations have not been disclosed.

[Reuters, New York, 18th] The political and economic discussions at the Foreign Ministers' Meeting and the United Nations Conference will enter a tense stage this week. Observers have also not neglected today's foreign policy debate in the British House of Commons. People within the British side are deeply uneasy about the Labor Party members' criticism of foreign policy at this moment, as Bevin is not only conducting negotiations on drafting a peace treaty here, but also concurrently handling various important negotiations with the Foreign Office, Treasury, Department of Commerce, and Ministry of Food, the results of which have a significant impact on Britain. The success or failure of the negotiations between the United States and Britain on merging the economies of the two German zones is even more related to Britain's overall economic situation. On the political front, today's five-power meeting will discuss the five powers voluntarily limiting the use of the veto power, and the agenda following the Foreign Ministers' Meeting, including the German question, will also be submitted for discussion today. The four-power Foreign Ministers' Meeting is scheduled to open at 9:00 p.m. to continue discussing the Trieste issue.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 17th] According to informed sources, the four-nation foreign ministers' meeting may choose Brussels, Belgium, as the location for discussing the German question.

### A Large Number of Southern Troops - Gather on the Greek Border - Conspiracy to Establish a "Greater Macedonian State" - Soviet Officer Corps Active Behind the Scenes

[Report] San Francisco, 18th broadcast: A spokesman for the Greek Third Army said today that the Greek Royal Air Force is supporting ground troops against the invading forces, and fighting is taking place along a seven-mile front in the South Archangelos area along the Yugoslav border.

[United Press, Istanbul, 17th] A certain important person, known for his opposition to the Yugoslav Tito government, arrived in Turkey last week and stated today that Yugoslavia has concentrated at least eleven divisions in the area of the northern border of Greece. Once the actual war breaks out in the Macedonian province of northern Greece, the army can go south. The Soviet officer corps, currently stationed in Bukuvu, Yugoslavia, is dispatched to the border from time to time for "inspection." The troops dispatched by Yugoslavia belong to the Second Army, with its headquarters in Novi. Someone saw these troops boarding military trains and passing through the Yugoslav capital on the night of the 2nd of this month, claiming to be heading for the Greek border. At the same time, 15,000 Greek left-wing guerrillas, together with other independent members of the Macedonian community, have formed two brigades, with their headquarters in Skolji. The goal is to merge a part of Thessaloniki to form an "independent Greater Macedonian state." ......

These vintage cars drove on the old road from London to Brighton today, creating a cacophony of clanging and rattling, with crowds of spectators cheering on both sides. Although there was a heavy frost today, the drivers were able to start the engines, which can also be considered a miracle.

### U.S. Economy Will Inevitably Decline After Peak; Crisis to Occur Next Spring

Predictions from Domestic Issues Experts

[Reuters Washington, 17th] After studying the national purchasing and production situation, American domestic issues experts predict that the first post-war economic fluctuation will occur next spring, but a large-scale fluctuation must wait until two years later. However, the economic fluctuation that will occur next spring will inevitably affect the country and even abroad. The United States has reached a boom period. The number of people employed and the number of unemployed people have reached unprecedented records in the United States. The national income has broken all records, and the production figures have also exceeded all previous figures. Therefore, this is a real boom phenomenon, and an opposite fluctuation will inevitably occur sooner or later. However, some optimistic Americans believe that Americans' purchasing power is still ample. During the war, life was tight, and people had a lot of savings. After the war, the demand for various items increased greatly, and the boom phenomenon can be maintained for a considerable period. On the other hand, some people also point out the unreliability of this theory. They put forward two facts to prove it: one is that the increase in wartime savings is not universal. In fact, only 10% of the people have a lot of savings, and the remaining 90% of the people have a few savings in the bank, but it is definitely not enough to cope with the increase in prices; The sharp rise in prices means that purchasers will soon reach a point where, although they need to buy, they are unwilling, and unable to buy one day. Several manufacturing businesses have already discovered this trend. American experts also said that there are two possibilities to avoid the economic crisis next spring: (1) Each industrial federation should unite and adopt a policy of not raising prices, or even reducing prices; (2) Due to the occurrence of labor strikes, wages will also increase accordingly, so that workers can cope with rising living expenses, but this is a temporary delay policy, and ultimately, a worse economic crisis will inevitably break out. Foreign markets may enable many manufacturers to overcome the difficulties of next spring, but if the government cannot adopt better policies to reconcile American manpower, production, and world needs, a situation worse than next spring will inevitably come.

### Japan in the Occupation Period (Part 2) The Occupation Work is Divided into Three Stages

— Original by Parrott, New York Times Tokyo Correspondent; Translated by Zhang Deqian

Every thoughtful Japanese knows that cooperation is the only way out in today's environment, even the remnants of militarists who may still be hiding underground hoping that "Der Tag" (German: That Day) will come soon think so too. The sooner the occupation ends, the sooner the various parties and factions in Japan will have the opportunity to engage in their respective political activities, especially those in the extremist factions. The conservative Asahi Shimbun, which has the largest circulation in Japan, once succinctly stated: "Whether the occupation can be completed in a short period depends on whether the occupation forces can cooperate smoothly with the Japanese people." In other words, the greater the degree of cooperation, the faster the occupation will end.

There are several important factors to consider. First, the occupation authorities conducted extensive investigations and found no organized underground activities. Second, Japanese liberals support the system we have provided and intend to promote its implementation. However, there is another group of people (it is impossible to estimate how many) who are heartbroken, full of resentment, and waiting for the opportunity to rebuild the old feudal politics. There is also a group of people pursuing a Soviet-style violent revolution, and the now quite widespread Communist propaganda is mainly aimed at this group.

One noteworthy factor is that the most simple Japanese people proved in April this year that they can indeed engage in democratic elections. When they were allowed to vote freely, they expressed significantly different political views, from pure communism to the extent permitted by the occupation forces. One of the people who received the most votes was later disqualified by MacArthur's headquarters as an undesirable person, namely Ichiro Hatoyama, leader of the Liberal Party.

From this significant political consciousness, it can be seen that the influence of the militarist rule on the Japanese people in the past was not as great as generally imagined; at least now, if you want to control them again, they will not be so easily submissive. The Japanese may not pay much attention to theory, although most of them seem willing to sacrifice old traditions to enjoy the new freedom given to them; please see that they voluntarily elected many women as members of the new Diet, although they used to consider women to be inferior. What they need is clothing, food, housing, and considerable political stability, enough to enable them to resume work and have the opportunity to rebuild their lives.

The Japanese have slowly begun to move forward on the road to construction. Japanese cities and towns are promoting construction plans. We see many small wooden houses being rebuilt like bamboo shoots after a spring rain in the ruins destroyed by bombs. One day, Shizuoka City proudly announced that it was the first city in all of Japan to complete a housing project for bombing refugees. Dance halls have reopened. Small shops are piled with simple goods. As the reporter writes this article, there is a group of Japanese children outside the window playing miniature baseball, running, shouting, and laughing. Recently, Tokyo's restaurants have been supplying luxurious meals to a small number of lucky wealthy people, so the government has become even stricter with the price limit for set meals. Shiny cars drive through the streets of Tokyo. They are not the cars of Allied generals. They are Japanese. A year ago, they were hidden in the most secluded places, fearing that they would be taken away by the occupation forces. But if you want to buy one of these cars, the price asked in Japanese Yen is almost equal to the mileage from Earth to Mars. No one has any confidence in the Japanese Yen. Inflation is constantly ongoing.

Japan's industry, which could have absorbed those unemployed people, is affected by the unresolved reparations issue. If a factory is to be dismantled and shipped abroad in the future to pay off war debts, the Japanese are obviously unwilling to rebuild, repair, renovate, or expand it in order to find work for the unemployed.

Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida once spoke in the Diet, using the simplest terms to explain that post-war Japan must maintain 70% of its pre-war population, with only 56% of its pre-war land, and must reduce multiple products, now have to import from abroad, and pay with industrial products. This is really the most basic problem of all problems.

As the occupation enters its second year, whether the Allies can obtain an answer to these many problems (the United Nations often has many similar problems in their own countries that cannot be resolved) is really a "gamble," not only for MacArthur but also for the entire Western world.

### Two Factories in Western Shanghai Destroyed by Fire; Burning for Three Hours; Losses Difficult to Estimate

[Our Report] The Hwa Foong Rubber Goods Factory, located at 54 Pan Chia Zhai, Tun Hsin Road, Western Shanghai, specializing in the manufacture of galoshes, running shoes, sneakers, etc., and its adjacent neighbor, 55 Wang Te Kee Waste Cotton Factory. Yesterday at about 5:10 PM, a fire suddenly broke out. Immediately, thick smoke soared, and flames erupted in all directions. The fire was extinguished at 8:30 PM. Afterwards, it was learned that the Hwa Foong Rubber Factory was burned down twenty-odd factory buildings, over ten large and small machines (rated at 280 horsepower). A large number of semi-finished products, raw materials, etc., were all burned. Losses exceeded 160 to 170 million yuan. The Wang Te Kee Cotton Factory was burned down four to five thousand dan of waste cotton, over ten factory buildings and all the engines, motors, machinery and other business assets, at the time the loss was difficult to estimate. The fire department arrived in minutes after the fire started, but there was no large fire hydrant inside Pan Chia Zhai and so water was piped from a spot one li away on the road, but the goods stored in the two plants—one waste cotton, one rubber, and sundries—were highly flammable, so once lit, the inferno could not be approached. Fortunately, no one was injured. As for the cause of the fire, which factory was the origin, the Changning Police Bureau is currently investigating.

Tenant Tang Jui-Fu, 27 of Zhenjiang, was using an air pump carelessly, causing the fire. Tang was momentarily panicked and did not extinguish the fire, instead fleeing, causing a disaster. In addition to the complete destruction of 27, the fire spread to 28 and 29. Also, because the residents there had no electric lighting facilities, most used kerosene lamps. Therefore, each household had an average of one and a half boxes of kerosene, and thus it added fuel to the fire and it was unstoppable. Despite the firefighters of the Nanshi Fire Department fighting to save the fire, the fire was extinguished only at 8:30, with considerable loss. The originator Tang Jui-Fu has been arrested by the police bureau, and is currently under investigation.

### Two Days of War Criminals Indicted by Military Tribunal for Abusing Allied Prisoners of War

The Shanghai Military Tribunal has learned: Japanese war criminals Odera Satoshi (male, 58 years old, from Kagoshima, Japan, former director of the Japanese Army Shanghai Haifang Road Prisoner of War Camp) and Kida Dou (male, 30 years old, from Tokyo, Japan, former chief of general affairs of the Japanese Army Shanghai Haifang Road Prisoner of War Camp) have been accused of abusing Allied prisoners of war. The tribunal has investigated and confirmed the facts and formally filed a public prosecution yesterday, with a trial to be held soon. In early November 1942, the Japanese army concentrated Allied nationals in Shanghai and detained them in the Haifang Road Prisoner of War Camp, managed by Odera and others. In early July 1945, all the detained nationals in the camp were transported to Fengtai, Hebei, for centralized detention, with Odera and others continuing to be responsible for management. The treatment of prisoners of war violated the international conventions on the treatment of prisoners of war during wartime. For example, there was insufficient food, the sick were not isolated, prisoners were not allowed to take refuge during air raids, Red Cross packages were stolen, prisoners' letters were withheld, forced salutes, beatings of prisoners, overcrowding in vehicles during prisoner transport, four-day journeys without sleep, and unsanitary facilities in the camp. There are dozens of accusations and crime investigation reports from former Allied prisoners of war, including Jin, Hill, Thompson, Willing, Berg, and Frederick, as well as statements from witnesses Hillman, Bizzi, and Wang Jisheng, a nurse at the former Ward Road Police Hospital. The defendants violated Articles 10, 11, 13, 14, 26, 36, 44, and 46 of the International Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War During Wartime and should be punished according to Article 2, Paragraph 2, and Article 3, Paragraph 29 of the Wartime Criminals Trial Regulations, combined with Article 26, Paragraph 1, second half, of the same regulations.

### Legal Procedures for Purchasing Blood Plasma, Responsibility Not with Merchants, Lida Trading Expresses Willingness to Return, but Must Be Reimbursed Reasonable Price

[Our Newspaper] Since the discovery of the false sale of American blood　 on the market, all sectors have paid close attention to it, and both Chinese and American authorities have ordered a thorough investigation of the truth. According to reporters' inquiries from various parties, the sale of this blood plasma does not seem to qualify as a "black market." Because the foreign merchant purchased it from the American Materials Clearing Committee through legal procedures, if the blood plasma should not be sold in the market, the responsibility does not lie with the merchant. Now the American side hopes to buy back the blood plasma at a price, and the merchant side has also expressed its willingness to do its utmost to assist.

According to the person in charge of Lida International Trading, the company that purchased the blood plasma, the American Materials Clearing Committee sent the company a list of pharmaceutical supply items in April this year, totaling more than 100 pages, including various drugs, and blood plasma was clearly listed. The company then placed an order with the American side based on this list of items, and all the payment was remitted to the U.S. Treasury. The total weight of the drugs was 10,000 tons, and the purchase price was 1.65 million U.S. dollars.

The company has now stopped selling blood plasma and expressed its willingness to return all the inventory, but the Clearing Committee should pay a reasonable price to avoid losses for the company. As of yesterday, the two sides had not yet agreed on the amount of the price. The inventory in the warehouse is being closely monitored by the U.S. Navy.

### Difficult Estate Tax Valuation, China Trust Bureau Assists

[Our Newspaper] The Direct Taxation Bureau is actively working on the collection of estate tax, but the investigation work is quite time-consuming, and valuation is also difficult. It is now planned to ask the China Trust Bureau to assist in valuation. Currently, the highest amount of estate tax paid is only more than 200,000 yuan, but there are cases under investigation that amount to hundreds of millions of yuan. Because the estate tax is a progressive tax with 18 levels, those exceeding 100 million yuan are taxed at 60% on the excess. The Direct Taxation Bureau hopes that all sectors will voluntarily pay estate tax to obtain inheritance protection. At the same time, it encourages whistleblowing, and if the investigation is verified, a bonus of 2% will be issued.

### Improving Telephone Efficiency, Adopting Unified Automatic System, Plan to Increase Users to More Than 130,000 Lines Within Five Years

[Our Newspaper] According to Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Works Bureau, Shanghai is an international commercial port, and the city's neural center, the telephone system, should have a unified and rational system to increase efficiency, facilitate management, and reduce costs. The plan to improve the city's telephone technology has been submitted to the Executive Yuan.

At the same time, the Shanghai urban area will be divided into inner and outer areas. The inner area includes the existing business and industrial areas with telephone supply, that is, the old concession, Nanshi, Zhabei, Pudong, and the outskirts of Shanghai will be designated as suburban areas. Within five years, the central area is planned to have 133,800 lines of users, and a six-digit number will be used. The telephone operating agency also needs to be unified.

### Fish Market Lending Capital to Buy Fish Causes Outside Criticism, Tang Chengzong Issues Statement

The Shanghai Fish Market has been criticized for setting up a temporary office in Shenjiamen to lend capital to large fishing boats to buy fish. This matter has also been published in small local newspapers in this port and in Ningbo. According to Tang Chengzong, general manager of the market, the reports are largely inconsistent with the facts. It has always been the custom in Shenjiamen that large fishing boats must borrow capital from fish merchants before going out to sea, and fish merchants who want to buy fresh fish locally also regard lending capital as their duty. In recent years, due to the sluggish business of fish merchants, large fishing boats have had difficulty borrowing capital and have been unable to go out to sea in time, resulting in a decline in production. In response to the requests of all parties concerned about the fishing industry, the market reluctantly raised 200 million yuan of operating funds to lend capital to large fishing boats to buy fish, which was originally intended to supplement the situation. However, due to limited financial resources, the amount was too small to be widely loaned, and because the organization was simple, it was unable to recruit more talented people recommended by all parties, resulting in dissatisfaction among those who were not selected, who said that the interest rate of 10% per month was usury that exploited fishermen. In fact, the stipulated interest rate is 6% per month, which is not much less than the interbank lending rate, and there is not little compensation already. It is also said that the loans are contracted by a small number of fish shops, but in fact, all loans are directly approved by the office and not handled by others. Furthermore, it is said that the amount of 200 million yuan is used to take advantage of the Farmers Bank's fishing loans. In fact, the Farmers Bank handles fishing loans by lending directly to households, and they are due in succession as early as May and June. The funds released by this market are part of the market's operating funds, which must be recovered successively when buying fish. The two are completely different and cannot be confused. What is rumored to the outside world is purely a misunderstanding. However, the market is carrying out this work to regulate the production and sales of fish. Since the decline of the fishing industry has not been resolved, the market's established policy will continue to be implemented seriously. If all sectors have good intentions to give instructions, we will sincerely welcome them.

The "body" work includes "soft waist," "lying fish," and "bright fan," which are demanding techniques. The drunken expression must not depart from the identity of the imperial concubine, and limiting the expression is especially difficult. Therefore, this play cannot be performed without innate talent and consummate skill, otherwise it is inevitable to "stink" and give a sense of difficulty without any reward. Mr. Mei's skill is still as good as ever, which is truly commendable. Now that he is leaking the performance of the "Drunken Beauty" that combines singing and acting, it is especially worth celebrating.

### Fireworks Prohibited During Winter Defense Period

According to the person in charge of the Garrison Department yesterday, during the winter defense period, citizens are strictly prohibited from setting off firecrackers and cannons at night, so as to avoid misunderstandings and prevent petty criminals from taking the opportunity to cause trouble. The Garrison Department will strictly regulate and prohibit this.

Also, Zhang Zhengfu and Zhang Zhengxiang, barbers at 84 Yan'an Road, were arrested for teasing women with firecrackers, and Zhang Zhigao, Shen Zhixiong, and Su Tongqing, employees of a knitting factory at 298 Dongtai Road, were arrested for setting off coal mines, all for violating the law.

[Report from Our Newspaper] According to the statistics office of the police bureau yesterday, the total number of lost and missing children in the city from January to October of this year was 982, an average of 98 per month. Among them, 442 were found and taken back by their families, 142 were sent to shelters, 40 were sent to the Jiliang Institute, 8 were sent to the Nursery, 10 were sent to the China Women's Relief Association, 14 were sent to the People's Hospital, and 4 were sent to the Municipal Hospital.

### The 2.7 Billion Yuan Embezzlement Case: CNRRA Sends Letter to District Attorney's Office Requesting Immediate Legal Action; Wu Suiren Is in Shanghai and Has Not Fled

[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding the case of Wu Suiren, chief of the cashier section of the General Affairs Department of the CNRRA, who embezzled 2.7 billion yuan of public funds for private lending at high interest rates, it is learned that the director of the department, Huo Baoshu, sent a letter to the Shanghai District Court Prosecutor's Office on the 16th of this month to handle the case in accordance with the law. The original letter stated: "It is hereby notified that this office received a telegram from the Nanjing headquarters of this administration on October 20, 1946, stating: 'The Central Bank has remitted 2.7 billion yuan in national currency to the UNRRA resident office as an advance for the expenses of September of this year. Please exchange it and reply by telegram.' We immediately inquired with the Central Bank. According to the bank, the funds were remitted on October 24. While we were inquiring, Wu Suiren, chief of the cashier section of this administration, stated that the above funds had been withdrawn for interest-bearing loans. He was momentarily confused and regretted it deeply. He is willing to return the transferred funds and interest in full.' Considering the large amount of funds, we advised him to return the full amount in order to avoid losses of public funds. To date, the employee has returned the above funds, together with interest of 14.6 million yuan in national currency, to the department for registration. The employee's service has been diligent on weekdays. Although he was momentarily confused this time, he repented afterward and returned all the public funds to the department, without suffering any losses. However, the transfer of public funds is illegal. In addition to being dismissed from his post, we have also sent a letter to the police bureau for investigation. We hereby send a corresponding letter, hoping that you will investigate and handle it in accordance with the law. To the Shanghai District Court Prosecutor's Office. Wu Suiren's address: No. 2, Ruifeng Lane, Dongjiaxing Road, North Sichuan Road, Hongkou."

According to reporters' inquiries at the department, Wu Suiren is still in Shanghai and has not fled. The employee had a guarantor when he joined the department. At the same time, the city police bureau has also filed the case, and it is not easy to escape. Wu Suiren is from Shexian County, Anhui Province, 38 years old, and graduated from Anhui University. In his early years, he served as a section chief in the Guizhou Provincial Government. He joined the CNRRA when it was established in Chongqing.

### CNRRA's Ships Carrying Commercial Goods Were Approved in Advance: Director of the Maritime Administration Bureau Explains the Truth

CNRRA ships carrying relief supplies often carry commercial goods in their remaining tonnage. The maritime industry in the city is very concerned about this matter and has repeatedly expressed opposition, believing that it damages the rights of shipping companies. It is also learned that the Yingkou Northeast Maritime Administration Bureau recently detained a CNRRA ship carrying commercial goods and telegraphed the Shanghai Maritime Administration Bureau, requesting consultations with Liu Hongsheng, executive director of the CNRRA. According to Li Gufan, director of the Maritime Administration Bureau, the CNRRA replied that the CNRRA ships carrying commercial goods using remaining tonnage had been approved by Premier Song, so it was not an unauthorized action. The Maritime Administration Bureau believed that since Premier Song had already approved it, it should be complied with. In addition to telegraphing the Yingkou Northeast Maritime Administration Bureau to release the detained CNRRA ship, it also notified shipping companies, explaining the truth of the matter. In the future, the Maritime Administration Bureau will uniformly allow CNRRA ships to carry commercial goods.

### Establishment of the Executive Committee of the Import Management Committee: Formulation of Detailed Rules for Implementation; Market is Calm and Responses from All Parties Are Good

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Executive Committee of the Provisional Import Management Committee officially began operations at 8:30 AM yesterday on the third floor of the Central Bank. All members of the executive committee immediately held a meeting. Chairman Bei presided, and all members Li Gan, Zhang Fuyun, Lin Weiying, Chen Changtong, and others attended. They immediately began to formulate and revise the detailed rules and procedures for the implementation of the Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade, as well as public announcements and other matters. Soon after the meeting, Mr. Bei summoned the heads of more than 20 Chinese and foreign banks designated to operate foreign exchange business, informing them that the revised Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade would be implemented immediately and instructing all banks to comply. Finally, the banks raised questions and were answered separately. If the banks have any unresolved questions, they can still submit them in writing in the future. In the afternoon at 4:00 PM, all members of the executive committee held another meeting, and by 6:00 PM, all the detailed rules for implementation were formulated. Chen Changtong, member of the executive committee and director of the secretariat, officially announced it to the journalists. (For the full text of the detailed rules, see the advertisement on page 9 of this newspaper). After Chen's report, he participated in the committee's continued meeting until it adjourned at around 7:00 PM.

In order to understand the reactions of all sectors after the promulgation of the revised Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade, our reporter specially interviewed leaders from various Chinese and foreign circles yesterday and inspected the market trends. The interview results are reported as follows:

Xu Jiqing's Views: This Move Can Promote Production Enterprises; It is Sincerely Hoped That Importers Will Not Raise Prices

Xu Jiqing, chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, said: In recent months, imported goods have been dumped in large quantities in China, while exports have been very few. Domestic production enterprises have been hit hard, and the US exchange rate has also been significantly affected. Therefore, the business community often has many criticisms. Now that the revised measures have been promulgated and implemented, unnecessary imports are restricted, and necessary imports are facilitated. Except for those prohibited from export, all exports can be freely exported. This move can promote the production enterprises in our country and will greatly help our country's economic situation. Also, the public officials in charge of this executive committee can be called the best of the time. Each member has rich knowledge and experience, so they should be able to successfully complete the task. However, one point must be noted, that is, goods that have already been imported may take the opportunity to rise in price. It is sincerely hoped that importers will take into account the welfare of the public and not arbitrarily raise prices.

Strengthening the Financial Position and Promoting Economic Stability

Comments from the Chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce

Mr. Keizik, chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce, said: The implementation of these revised measures proves the government's determination to maintain and strengthen China's financial position. Prudent and cautious importers often welcome these measures. From a long-term perspective, these measures will stabilize the economic situation. Also, the public officials in charge of the executive committee are all well-known people. However, if these measures are studied in detail, foreign businesses will have three main questions: (1) How will contracts that have already been established be handled? (2) How will the quotas for imported goods without limits be determined? (3) The import of industrial equipment often takes years. Can the Central Bank provide the foreign exchange required for this aspect? Keizik then said: The above is purely from the observations between meetings. As for suggestive comments, it will take some time for this new agency to work before there are any clues.

Comments from Leaders of the American Chamber of Commerce

Mr. Smith, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce, told reporters in a humorous tone: The arrival of these revised measures seems a bit too hasty. However, due to time constraints, I have not yet had time to study the contents of all the measures in detail. One thing is very clear, that is, a permit must be obtained in advance for each type of imported goods. As for how to apply, how long it will take to apply and issue the permit, and whether the application form has been printed, no one knows yet. Also, how will imported goods that are en route be handled? The military business I run has long been on the list of permitted imports. Therefore, the implementation of the revised measures should not have any impact on my business. However, this import permit system has now been extended to general imported goods.

Application Procedures Should Be Fast; Restriction of Quotas Must Be Fair

Mr. Zhang Huanzhang, chairman of the Shanghai Import and Export Commercial Association, said: The current quantity of imported goods is really too large, and most of them are luxury goods and consumables. After the implementation of this measure, what I hope for are the following points: (1) The application procedures for import should be as fast as possible. (2) The restriction of the allocated quota should be as fair as possible. (3) According to the provisions of the measures, importers must register with the Provisional Import Management Committee. However, most importers have already registered with the Import and Export Association, so it is hoped that if they are members of the association, it will be sufficient as proof of registration. (4) It is hoped that some relevant commercial organizations can participate in the current executive committee to avoid barriers. (5) It is hoped that there will be a limit for each type of imported goods. Within the limit, each importer should be allowed to freely allocate the settlement of the import. (6) How to make the allocation of the quota fair is worth considering and researching in detail. He finally said: After the implementation of the revised measures, importers will inevitably increase the difficulty. Because now when ordering from abroad, there may not be goods immediately after ordering. If a permit is required before ordering, it is even more difficult to know whether the goods to be ordered will still be available after the permit is obtained.

Hope That the Implementation Measures Will Achieve Their Well-Intended Purpose

Mr. Zhang Yujiu, executive director of the China Import and Export Trade Association, said: The promulgation of the revised measures is tantamount to giving the domestic industrial production sector an opportunity to recover. For example, restricting the import of non-essential goods and facilitating the import of production machines are all very good intentions. However, it is hoped that the authorities will clearly distinguish between goods that are permitted for import and those that are not. The application procedures for goods that are permitted for import should be simplified as much as possible to facilitate rapid import. For goods that are not permitted for import, it is better to simply prohibit their import, and not adopt passive restrictive measures. On the one hand, they still accept applications, and on the other hand, they delay the date of approval for import, which only inconveniences merchants. Zhang then said: The intention of establishing any control measures is always good. It is sincerely hoped that after the implementation of these measures, they can fully achieve their well-intended purpose. Regarding the export issue, Zhang put forward two hopes: (1) Find ways to reduce domestic production costs, (2) Hope that the Chinese people will not depreciate and dump goods in foreign markets to avoid reducing the export price of Chinese goods and causing losses to the country and the people.

Rescuing the Industrial and Commercial Crisis and Loosening Foreign Exchange Positions

Mr. Qiu Liangrong, the person in charge of the China Import and Export Trade Association, said that the implementation of the revised measures will greatly benefit the industrial sector of this city. The threat of competition from foreign goods can be reduced as a result. At the same time, the government has also agreed to issue industrial loans, which will help to rescue the industrial and commercial crisis in this city. In addition, the government can provide more protection for the allocation of foreign exchange. Qiu believes that in the past, when China purchased imported goods, importers often bought goods blindly, which was equivalent to rushing to buy goods. As a result, most importers lost money. After adopting the permit import system, this abnormal import situation can be improved a lot. Qiu said that most of the current import and export firms in the city are newly established organizations. Some import firms with a long history have not joined the association as members, and they often operate several kinds of imported goods at the same time. Therefore, the standards for registering importers and the allocation of quotas need to be carefully considered. According to Qiu's observation, the most important issue after the implementation of the revised measures is smuggling. The sources of smuggling are: (1) Hong Kong, (2) Shanghai imported merchant ships. It is expected that due to quota restrictions, the price of goods that cannot be permitted for import will rise, and the profits will be greater. Where there is profit, merchants will find ways to smuggle, so the government should pay close attention to this.

### The Market Prices of US Dollars and Gold Both Fell Yesterday

[Report from Our Newspaper] After the administrative authorities announced the implementation of the population permit system, the black market prices of US dollars and gold both fell yesterday. However, experienced observers said that unless the import permit system is effectively implemented and smuggling can be eradicated, the black market price of US dollars will still rise; gold will also rise with the US dollar, but due to pressure from the Central Bank, the rise will not be as drastic as that of the US dollar. There are two reasons why the US dollar tends to rise: (1) The currency value is unstable, and lending at high interest rates is unsafe. Some people buy US dollars as a way to preserve value. (2) At present, foreign goods are still being smuggled rampantly throughout the country. These transactions all require payment in cash in US dollars, so some people are buying US dollars on the market, causing the black market to rise sharply in recent days. Just look at the US goods displayed in the shops, most of which are not goods that the government allows to be imported. The Central Bank's approval of foreign exchange is very strict. Chinese and foreign merchants collude in smuggling, and US dollars are used as payment tools. Since demand is large and supply is limited, a price increase is inevitable. Also, the market price of stocks rose briefly yesterday morning because Premier Song announced support for domestic production enterprises, which boosted morale. However, due to the overall outlook, it is still not optimistic, and the price fell back in the afternoon. Observers believe that the government's support will not take effect in the short term; therefore, the future changes in the stock market price will be less affected by the implementation of the import permit system in the short term and more affected by changes in the current situation. As for the selling price of US goods on the market, as of noon yesterday, no fluctuations had been seen.

### Reducing Unnecessary Imports and Protecting Local Industry and Commerce: Rationally Distributing Imported Goods According to Their Urgency

Zhang Fuyun Explains the Main Points of the New Measures

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the reporter visited Zhang Fuyun, Director of the Customs Administration, to inquire about his thoughts and opinions on the revised Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade. He replied that, standing in the position of a government official, he could not make any criticisms or have any opinions. However, the various points inquired by the reporter can be summarized and explained as follows: (1) The government's motive for adopting the import permit system is definitely not to restrict the normal needs of the people. For example, cotton is a necessity for the people, so it should be allowed to be imported. The government's intention is only to rationally allocate the types and quantities of imported goods. At the same time, our country's international balance of payments is too unbalanced. After the implementation of this measure, unnecessary imports can be reduced, so that our country's import and export value can gradually tend to balance. (2) Raising the import tax rate is still in the planning and research stage. This is completely separate from the implementation of the import permit system, and the two can complement each other. (3) The allocation of quotas for various commodities in the future is the most important task at present. The Provisional Import Management Committee is currently discussing it in detail. The principle is to make appropriate allocations according to the needs of the people. I am not at liberty to discuss this point in detail. (4) Smuggling work will be strengthened in the future. The situation of smuggling in this city has been reduced. However, the situation in southern China is very serious. We will strengthen crackdowns in the future to prevent unnecessary foreign goods from entering our country's market. (5) From my point of view, the implementation of the import permit system does not conflict with the Sino-US Treaty of Commerce. The conclusion of the treaty is entirely based on equality and mutual benefit. Under the new measures, we welcome the import of production tools from friendly countries. As for the fact that our country's delegation to the London International Trade and Employment Conference approved the US proposal, I am afraid there are reservations. The conclusion of the new measures is the exercise of our country's sovereignty, and others will surely understand. (6) The new measures are not specifically aimed at reducing imports to achieve a balance in the international balance of payments. The protection of domestic industry and commerce is already implied in the classification of commodities.

### Hu Boxiang's Thoughts

Protecting Our Country's Production Enterprises and Preventing the Possible Dumping of Foreign Goods

[Report from Our Newspaper] Mr. Hu Boxiang, incumbent director of the China Industrial Association and person in charge of the National Goods Manufacturers Federation, spoke in detail to reporters yesterday about his thoughts on our country's implementation of the import permit system. The main points are summarized as follows: (1) The purpose of these measures is to restrict the import of light industrial products and welcome the import of sophisticated machinery. This is beneficial to domestic manufacturers and protects our country's production enterprises. It is truly a wise measure by the government. (2) When prohibiting the import of goods that our country does not need, we must simultaneously eradicate smuggling in order to achieve practical results. Otherwise, the import is prohibited in name, but smuggling still continues, resulting in a loss of tariff revenue. (3) For commodities that are prohibited from import, the manufacture of similar commodities by foreign businesses in China should also be prohibited at the same time; for commodities that are restricted from import, the manufacture of similar commodities by foreign businesses in China should also be restricted at the same time in order to be thorough. For commodities that our country does not need, in addition to strictly implementing the import permit system, the import tax rate should also be increased. (4) When restricting the import of foreign goods, if they are raw materials and necessities for industry, a detailed investigation should be carried out first to ensure that legitimate industries and businesses can obtain an appropriate supply. It is necessary to avoid this kind of quota-limited supply of goods falling into the hands of speculators, resulting in hoarding and price gouging to seek high profits, causing legitimate industries and businesses to suffer losses. At the same time, the government should pay attention to the price of such quota-limited imports in the place of origin, as a basis for rational price limits; and investigate the previous needs of each factory, as a standard for future allocation. If the quota measures are not well implemented, they will harm domestic goods manufacturers. I hope that the government will implement all of this carefully. The above are Mr. Hu's thoughts on the new import measures from the perspective of the Industrial Association. From the perspective of the domestic goods business, Mr. Hu also believes that the current measures can prevent the possible dumping of foreign goods. Dumping has not yet been discovered, but commodities such as milk powder are flooding our country's market at low prices. In order to prevent this kind of situation, the government should establish an agency overseas to investigate the prices of exports from various countries in the Chinese market in order to prevent dumping. The reporter asked if domestic goods would rise in price due to a reduction in supply after foreign goods imports were drastically reduced. Mr. Hu believes that industries that can truly exist for a long time will not take the opportunity to seek windfall profits. For several months, the price of domestic products has not risen sharply. I believe that if usury can be cracked down on, the import permit system will not cause the price of domestic goods to rise.

### Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export to Convene and Discuss, Submitting Concrete Opinions for Government Adoption

[Our Newspaper's Report] The import and export industry is most sensitive to the new measures. Zhou Jingwei, deputy secretary-general of the industry association in this city, told reporters that the main purposes of the government's measures are: first, to strengthen the control of the entire trading industry; and second, to find a way out for the large quantities of surplus materials recently purchased. In the past, the control of the import and export industry was the responsibility of the Central Bank. This responsibility was too heavy and lost contact with the executive authorities. Now, with the establishment of the Temporary Management Committee, manpower is concentrated, command is unified, and control is greatly strengthened. The value of the US military surplus materials recently purchased by our country is actually 800 million US dollars, and the variety is large and the quantity is enormous. Under the new measures, the government can sell them to import and export merchants; in this way, the materials will have a sales channel, and the government can reduce imports and save foreign exchange. It is expected that after the implementation of the new measures, the government will strictly verify the merchants who legally operate import and export businesses. At the same time, in the future, it will be difficult for merchants operating import and export businesses, such as those who used to operate more than 40 kinds of goods, to continue; and the business operations of merchants will gradually become specialized. For example, those who operate imported machinery cannot suddenly switch to importing raw materials, or similar "jumping" will occur. There are more than 600 member merchants in this city who are engaged in import and export, and it is hoped that import and export merchants with special backgrounds can also join the association. Because this type of merchant has strong backing, they have openly written to foreign merchants in the past, stating that even if the Central Bank does not approve foreign exchange, they can still conduct transactions. Such remarks have greatly dissatisfied honest foreign merchants. It is expected that under the new measures, this type of import and export company will still have its special conveniences. The Import and Export Chamber of Commerce will convene a meeting in the next few days to discuss and study the new import measures in detail, and will submit concrete opinions for the government to adopt. What is currently hoped is that the government will respect the position of the Chamber of Commerce, and that the allocation of quotas in the future can be reasonably resolved through the Chamber of Commerce. Mr. Zhou believes that the classification order of imported goods is still appropriate, but the classification is not detailed enough; and he said that there will be detailed supplementary measures soon, and there will be certain handling methods for imported goods ordered before the announcement of the new measures.

### Social Services Reader Consultations

Medicine and Health

(1) Skin Cancer

Shen Hesheng asks: My friend, Mr. Ma, is 31 years old and in good health. Last summer, a lump suddenly appeared on the left side of his neck, shaped like a chess piece. At first, he didn't pay attention to it, but it became increasingly severe in May of this year. According to the doctor's diagnosis, it was concluded that it was a skin cancer of the lymph nodes, caused by nasal cancer. It was impossible to surgically remove it, and he was told to seek treatment from another doctor. Mr. Ma had no choice but to leave the hospital. Currently, his tongue is already inconvenient, his tone is inaccurate, and his appetite is greatly reduced. He can barely eat some thin porridge. Is this disease already hopeless? Please tell me the treatment method?

[Answer from Dr. Zhang Zhongming] If nasal cancer has spread to the lymph nodes in the neck, it cannot be surgically removed and should be treated with X-rays or radium.

(2) Delayed Development

Gu Yu asks: My relative, Ling Jun, is now 19 years old, but his height is still no more than three 市尺 (Chinese feet), and he is abnormally obese. He has not yet developed. I don't know what disease he is suffering from? How should he be treated? Please reply.

[Answer from Dr. Zhang Zhongming] Your relative's obesity, shortness, and lack of development are caused by a deficiency of endocrine secretions from the pituitary gland. He should seek medical treatment and then use medication.

### Mayor Wu Convenes Textile Industry to Discuss Eliminating Black Market in Cotton Yarn, Agreed on Methods to Settle Futures Contracts within a Time Limit

[Our Newspaper's Report] Mayor Wu convened an emergency meeting at 2:30 pm yesterday (the 18th) in the City Government Auditorium to discuss ways to eliminate the black market in cotton yarn. Those attending included Shu Yunzhang, general manager of the China Textile Construction Corporation; Wang Qiyu, chairman of the Sixth District Cotton Yarn Association; Lin Baobao and Yang Xiren from the Textile Management Committee; Pan Shihao from the dyeing and weaving industry; Xu Zhaohou from the hosiery industry; Yao Siwei from the handkerchief industry; Dong Jiufeng from the cotton weaving industry; Shi Yihu from the Chongxin Yarn Factory; Rong Hongyuan from the Shenxin Yarn Factory; Guo Dihuo from the Wing On Yarn Factory; and Dong Chunfang from the Tongyi Yarn Factory. Mayor Wu presided over the meeting, first stating the government's determination to crack down on the black market in cotton yarn, hoping that all sectors would not think that the promulgated decrees were just empty words. The government is fully determined to thoroughly eliminate the black market. He continued, "The reason I am convening this emergency meeting today is because I received a telegram from President Song yesterday from Nanjing, instructing me to inform yarn merchants that strengthening the control of imported goods will benefit domestic yarn merchants. He also stated that there is absolutely no problem with the source of cotton, so cotton yarn can be produced as much as possible, and there is no reason for the existence of a black market." Mayor Wu also personally inspected the cotton yarn markets yesterday afternoon. As a result, it was found that the Xiehe Yarn Store on Jiangxi Road had a major wrongdoing. The store bought 290 pieces of yarn on October 25, but the whereabouts of 80 pieces are unknown. A thorough investigation is underway. In addition, after yesterday afternoon's investigation, there was a great deal of information gained regarding the factors that create the current black market, and a large amount of evidence has been collected. From the government's perspective, it should have been severely punished, but in order to give everyone a chance to completely change their thinking, leniency is being shown, and it is hoped that everyone will think more about the public good. When Mayor Wu spoke, his tone was firm and his words were very serious. He concluded by saying: "All of you sitting here today are representatives of the cotton yarn industry and yarn factories. Please explain why black market prices still exist, and discuss ways to crack down on them together."

Reasons for the Occurrence of the Black Market

Wang Qiyu, chairman of the Sixth District Cotton Yarn Association, expressed his opinion: "The statement that the monthly production of cotton yarn is 65,000 pieces is incorrect. The current production of cotton yarn in this city can only spare 400 pieces per day. Calculated at 24 days per month, the monthly surplus is 12,000 pieces. The only hope for private factories now is to do their best to add new spindles and new equipment. Regarding the factors of the black market, Mr. Wang believes that the price of 12-pound fine cloth has risen, and each bolt of cloth can earn 20,000 yuan, so merchants want to buy more yarn. In the case of supply not meeting demand, the black market arises."

Tang Xinghai, a director of the Sixth District Cotton Yarn Association, said: "There are two reasons for the black market: (1) The knitting industry needs 20-count yarn, but it is allocated 32-count yarn, so it must sell this and buy that. (2) Different manufacturers need different types of yarn. For example, those who are accustomed to using '云牌' will refuse to use '双马牌', and in the process of buying and selling, the black market is created."

Mr. Ye from the knitting industry said: "The first step for the six knitting associations is to stop buying at black market prices, but because the amount of allocated yarn is insufficient, it is impossible to prohibit buying in. Therefore, he advocated that if the amount of yarn cannot be increased, he is willing to reduce work, but he hopes that the city government will find a way to mediate with the workers. He also advocated that the allocation price of cotton yarn can be appropriately increased."

Content of the Textile Construction Corporation

Finally, Shu Yunzhang of the Textile Construction Corporation reported on the true content of the company, saying that most of the company's cotton yarn production this year must be supplied for the production of military uniforms, and a considerable amount must also be reserved in May next year, so the Textile Construction Corporation has already made its greatest efforts, and it is currently difficult to talk about increasing production. Regarding yarn allocation, he hoped that it could reach 80% to 90% of the demand. For the knitting industry, he could provide a detailed list of needs, and said that this is a time when "mutual concession is for the country," and he hoped that everyone would not be discouraged. Furthermore, in the current situation where supply cannot meet demand, he hoped that manufacturers would not engage in futures trading.

Finally, Mayor Wu made a concluding statement: (1) Regarding the electricity saving issue, he has discussed it with the Municipal Public Works Bureau and will soon launch senior city government officials to earnestly persuade all streets and shops. Mayor Wu has also decided to take action himself and lead by example. He guaranteed that the electricity saving issue will definitely be thoroughly implemented in order to increase production. (2) Regarding the cotton issue, if manufacturers want to go to other ports, such as Hankou and Zhengzhou, to purchase cotton, and lack funds, he guaranteed that the Central Bank will definitely find a way to provide loans. Finally, Mayor Wu believed that it was extremely unreasonable for manufacturers to engage in futures trading without bearing interest. Regarding the issue of cracking down on the black market, four important measures were agreed upon: (1) From today until the 25th, all futures contracts of each manufacturer (except those that have been paid off) must be cleared within this week, calculated at a discount rate of one cent per yuan, and returned to the holder of the order. Otherwise, the holder of the order is allowed to report to the city government. (2) From now on, when each manufacturer engages in futures trading, interest must be deducted first. (3) From today on, all cotton yarn transactions must be completed in the market of the Cotton Yarn Industry Association. If yarn is sold outside the market, it will be regarded as illegal and will be severely punished according to law. . Yarn factories that voluntarily export must undergo detailed registration and must have a corresponding time limit. If the goods are not shipped out by the deadline, they will all be regarded as hoarding.

### Gold and Paper Money Both Fall

The gold market yesterday showed some stability. It opened at 2,500,500. After the opening, the sellers were even more eager due to the pressure from the Central Bank, and gradually declined from 2,514,000, retreating to within the 2,500,000 mark. The Central Bank immediately allocated 150 bars at a price of 2,497,500. After 10 o'clock, it became even more sluggish. The US dollar weakened, and the gold market also felt exhausted and under pressure. Therefore, the price of 2,500,000 could not be sustained. It once fell to 2,487,000 near noon, and struggled at around 2,490,000 at noon. In the afternoon, next-day delivery rose first and then fell back. As a result, it fell back 32,000 compared to last Saturday. Gold ornaments were at 264,000. Sycee silver did not change. Silver dollars rose again by one grade.

### "Local Emperor" of Southern Henan Imprisoned

— Wang Shoumei, Our Kaifeng Correspondent

13th Dispatch

Gu Ying, the "King of Shangcheng," renowned in southern Henan, has been dismissed and detained by the Henan Provincial Government. It is as if a fierce tiger has been caught in a cage.

Shangcheng has been shrouded in the terror of death for eight years, having long lost its light and justice, with no principles or laws. It has become another world, and the master of this world is Gu Ying, the creator of terror.

Regarding the emergence of the "local emperor" Gu Ying, people in Shangcheng say, "Gu Ying only had three benefactors in his 'achievements': one was a warlord, one was the Communist Party, and the other was the Japanese invaders." That is to say, the warlords, the Communist Party, and the Japanese invaders created a special environment for him, enabling him to become the "King of Shangcheng" after conquering Shangcheng with terror.

Military and Political Power Concentrated in One Person

Gu Ying has a simple mind, lacks common sense, and is a complete "country bumpkin." He has not studied any military or political theories, nor has he read official documents. His dictionary only contains the word "kill." He started with the Red Spear Society. Long before the War of Resistance, under the protection and support of a certain warlord, he organized the Red Spear Society in the Xinsheng Township area of Shangcheng, gathering local armed forces and uniting bandits and hoodlums. The warlord wanted to use him to expand his own power, while Gu Ying wanted to use this opportunity to lay the foundation for conquering Shangcheng by force. Before long, he possessed considerable military strength.

In the early days of the War of Resistance, due to our military setbacks, the enemy, after occupying Nanjing and Shanghai, advanced westward along the Yangtze River, and the situation in Wuhan became critical. In order to arrange the defense of Greater Wuhan, Deputy Chief of Staff Bai particularly paid attention to Shangcheng, the gateway to the Dabie Mountains, because if Shangcheng fell, the enemy could cross the Dabie Mountains and directly threaten Wuhan. Because Shangcheng occupied an important strategic position, the local armed forces in Shangcheng were also valued. At that time, Gu Ying, who possessed strong military power in Shangcheng, had an ambiguous attitude. Bai believed that this force, no matter what, must be used in the righteous path of self-defense and national defense. Otherwise, this force would either surrender to the enemy or become traitors. Therefore, Gu Ying was appointed as the Commander of Assaults and concurrently the Magistrate of Shangcheng County, concentrating military and political power in one person. This gave him a great opportunity to display his "ambitions."

After he grasped the political and military power of Shangcheng, he immediately adopted two approaches: one was to create terror through massacres in order to achieve the goal of conquest and rule; the other was to strengthen the special nature of Shangcheng, creating a psychology of accommodation to the environment at the higher levels, thereby consolidating his military and political position. His approach was successful. His military and political position in Shangcheng was maintained under this approach until he was detained. The provincial authorities only understood the true situation in Shangcheng very recently.

Parents Host a Banquet to Apologize After Their Son is Killed by Magistrate Gu

Under his terrible approach, what crimes did he commit? The 300,000 people of Shangcheng can tell everyone:

He loved to kill, using killing to establish his authority and eliminate dissidents. He would kill anyone he had a grudge against, and he would kill anyone who disobeyed him. Over the past seven or eight years, among the well-known upright gentlemen killed under his butcher's knife were Hong Xiangqing, Mei Youxiang, Hu Xiange, and others. As for the rest, some had their entire families buried alive by him, and some were assassinated by him in secret. The numbers are simply countless. In November of the 32nd year of the Republic, a student disturbance occurred at the Shangcheng branch of the Henan Provincial Xinyang Normal School due to a minor matter. Gu Ying, in his capacity as county magistrate, went to maintain order at the school. After arriving at the school, during the weekly memorial service, he hinted to his henchmen to shoot and kill Bao Qifu, a good student at the school, on the spot, causing an uproar among the faculty and students. Three days after this incident occurred, this reporter happened to arrive in the county on official business and was shocked to hear about it. However, no one dared to express an opinion on this case. This reporter repeatedly asked them about it, but no one dared to say a word. Even more strangely, the parents of the deceased hosted a banquet in the city to invite Magistrate Gu to dinner, formally apologizing to Magistrate Gu at the banquet: "Our child deserved to die. Please don't be angry, Magistrate, and don't hold it against us..." The ferocity of Gu Ying and the pitiful misery of the people under his conquest can be seen from this.

I remember that when this reporter met with the "local emperor" that time, he told me frankly and proudly, "The affairs of Shangcheng are easy to handle. When my orders go down, they are carried out to the letter. Everyone knows my temper. If they don't obey me, I won't be polite. For example, when I prohibit gambling, I just put up a sign with four words: 'Gambling is prohibited.' Then, if anyone is found gambling within the borders of Shangcheng, my plainclothes team will simply throw a bomb at them, sending them all back to their hometowns." (As he said this, he opened his mouth wide, emitting a proud and terrifying laugh, like a tiger roaring in an empty valley, making one's hair stand on end.) "Also, when dealing with prostitutes, I remember one morning, I suddenly thought that prostitutes were not allowed. I immediately issued an order limiting the prostitutes to leave the country that day. If prostitutes were found within the borders of Shangcheng County by nightfall, they would be buried alive. Can't prostitutes run away? Humph, that's because it's not time yet. I remember that day, as soon as the order came down, they rushed to get on the road so desperately that they didn't even care about their luggage. By nightfall, not one of them had failed to run beyond the county's borders, which were 120 miles away."

Words of a Murderous Demon

"Even a three-year-old child must be killed, lest he kill me in the future?"

He had many types of punishment, and they were very cruel. Regardless of whether it was a criminal or civil case, regardless of the severity of the case, he would make them experience his power. It is said that in the western countryside of the county, a certain family had a dispute with someone over land. Somehow, it aroused his anger, and he buried the entire family alive. In the end, only a three-year-old child was left. His guards, seeing the situation, felt it was too tragic and couldn't bear to bury him anymore. Gu Ying was furious and said, "We must uproot the weeds to prevent future trouble. Will this little beast kill me in the future?" So he did it himself, dug a pit, and buried the child as well. In Shangcheng, it was illegal to smoke or sell cigarettes. A certain Zhou was executed by Gu Ying using electric shocks for selling cigarettes.

Words of Grief and Anger from the Common People

"My work will not stop until the Commander is dead"

Gu Ying was healthy and strong. He had three concubines. All three of these concubines were snatched from other people. They lived in the Cai Tangzi, Sifangwa, and Shenjiafan areas of Xinsheng Township. He knew how to enjoy himself. He knew how to keep his mistresses in a golden house. He conscripted labor and materials to build magnificent and luxurious residences in these three places, totaling more than a thousand grand rooms. It is said that the walls of the grand rooms were built with beautiful flower stone bars, and the thickness of the walls reached three meters, said to be impenetrable by mortars. In order to build the houses, it was necessary to have flower stone bars, so a ten-mile-long road was opened up in the steep cliffs. The conscripted people dared not say they were unwilling and were still honestly working for Gu Ying. But there was also a saying there: "My work will not stop until the Commander is dead." Everyone remembered this saying in their hearts, but no one dared to say it out loud. After many years as commander and county magistrate, he had become an astonishingly wealthy man. He now owned 18,000 mu of fertile land. His wealth, of course, came from extortionate taxes and levies. In addition to paying regular grain taxes every year, the people of Shangcheng were also charged an additional four to seven dou per stone (each dou being thirty catties) by Gu Ying in the name of running education, called "Jidao Zhuang." In the spring, they were charged an additional two to three dou of wheat per stone. Apart from the one or two percent used for running schools, no one dared to question the rest. For years, there were natural disasters and poor harvests, and the people grew thinner day by day, while Gu Ying grew fatter day by day!

Routine official documents from the higher authorities were never valued in his place. His county government secretary used his red inkpad seal every day to stamp those routine official matters "depending on the circumstances." Subordinates who saw these official documents also put them on the shelf, and even if it was a big deal, it was considered done. He had another pattern of blue inkpad seal for his own use. If he issued an order, he would use this seal. Subordinates, upon seeing the handwritten order with the blue seal, would carry out the order without fail, day and night. A slight negligence would lead to unimaginable consequences.

His stubborn attitude was rarely seen. I remember that when he spoke with this reporter that time, he said, "I (Shangcheng dialect, meaning 'I') have not read the Three Principles of the People, and I don't care about the Three Principles of the People. I just do it this way, and I don't care if people criticize me or not. I have my own ideas." How many such stubborn people can be found among the current administrative personnel?

At the last provincial administrative conference, many people thought that he would not attend the province, and many people also hoped to catch a glimpse of this murderous demon. Who knew that he would bring three sacks of banknotes with him? After arriving in Kaifeng, he tried his best to send those banknotes to the important people who could help him, because he knew that the roars of those conquered slaves in Shangcheng had already shaken Kaifeng.

The Henan Provincial Government authorities remained silent on this case at the time. This silence caused unease among the people of Shangcheng and also attracted the attention of the media. The newspapers here all published the crimes of this "local emperor" in prominent positions.

Chairman Liu, who was calm and decisive, was after all determined to purify the bureaucracy. As soon as the administrative conference closed, he issued a silent order to dismiss Gu Ying and instructed the provincial police bureau to detain Gu Ying.

When this news spread, people were overjoyed and it caused a sensation. Especially the people of Shangcheng were so excited that they almost jumped up.

Now, Gu Ying has been detained for quite some time and has long been transferred from the provincial police bureau to the court for trial. However, a trace of doubt seems to have been added to the excited faces of the people of Shangcheng, because the court has been slow to pronounce a verdict. They fear that the court will sentence this murderous demon Gu Ying to a term of three or two years. Once Gu Ying posts bail, he will be like a tiger released from its cage, and letting the tiger return to the mountain would be unthinkable for the people of Shangcheng. They are not being overly concerned. Social figures here are also sweating for the people of Shangcheng on this issue.

The Henan-Shandong Supervisory Envoy's Office had submitted an impeachment document on the Gu Ying case a few days ago. Social figures who read the impeachment document were filled with righteous indignation, and everyone advocated quickly stabbing this tiger to death. However, the Kaifeng District Court, which is handling the case, has its own procedures. It cannot, as people generally imagine, simply execute Gu Ying immediately before all the evidence has been fully obtained.

Today, the Henan Minbao and China Times here published such a message: "Central News Agency Dispatch: After Gu Ying, the former magistrate of Shangcheng County, was reported by people in the county, the Henan-Shandong Supervisory Envoy's Office sent personnel to Shangcheng for more than a month and uncovered dozens of cases of corruption and illegal activities, all of which were confirmed, and impeachment was filed, causing social outrage. It is heard that the provincial government also sent officials to Shangcheng to investigate at the same time and collected more ironclad evidence. The investigation report was more than 50,000 to 60,000 words, all with opinions signed by the relevant authorities, and the case files have been transferred to the Kaifeng District Court for concurrent prosecution. Among them, such items as treating human life like grass, corruption figures, stealing national defense equipment, and intercepting the 39th Army are even more lawless and shocking. Moreover, most of the items investigated were not disclosed by the informants in the county. It is now heard that the informants in the county have requested the Kaifeng District Court to supplement the prosecution in accordance with the law based on the facts."

After this message was published, people in society stretched their necks, hoping for the arrival of the doomsday of this chaotic demon, and even those wronged souls under Gu Ying's butcher's knife were waiting for news day and night in front of the Kaifeng District Court!

### A Look at Xinjiang

— Special Translation by Our Editorial Office

Ensuring the Gateway to the Western Border

After the reporter drove a Jeep on a pilgrimage for several days along the ancient desert caravan routes south of the Tianshan Mountains in Xinjiang, he can naturally make a just and positive account of the current political and economic situation of this medieval Islamic civilization. This economic system formed a small oasis in the vast and boundless desert. Since Sheng Shicai usurped power in the new province in 1933, it has been virtually isolated from the modern world. Now, under the rule of the new provincial chairman, General Zhang Zhizhong, Xinjiang has embarked on the road to revival.

On August 26, 1945, at the height of the Ili rebellion, an army composed of Muslims, Uyghurs, Uzbeks, Tajiks, and Kyrgyz people captured B犁 (a fortress in southern Xinjiang Province and a gateway to Afghanistan, the Soviet Union, and India). The city was occupied by 13,000 rebels and was returned to the Chinese army on July 1, in accordance with the treaty signed in Dihua on June 6. Subsequently, large numbers of National Army troops flowed into southern Xinjiang, stationing heavy forces in the important cities of Turpan, Kuche, Aksu, Shule, Puli, and Shache.

According to unofficial Chinese sources, the Soviet Union is conducting vivid anti-Chinese propaganda among the local people of Xinjiang. This propaganda is enhanced by the influx of Russian goods into the local markets. This is possible, but it must be understood that the Islamic nations of the neighboring Soviet republics are of the same bloodline as the Muslims of Xinjiang, and political boundaries are not very important to them. The reporter spent half a month with the leaders of the Muslims in Xinjiang and was unable to detect the slightest communist tendency among these frontier peoples. On the contrary, they expressed disgust with the Chinese Communist Party.

According to the Uyghurs, nearly 100,000 National Army troops are stationed in southern Xinjiang Province, and the number is still increasing. The Xinjiang authorities are unwilling to disclose the actual number of troops stationed there. A few months ago, the people regained confidence in the National Government due to Chairman Zhang's virtuous policies of abolishing taxes and releasing political prisoners. Now, that confidence has begun to waver with the large increase in the number of National Army troops. Local leaders have issued appeals, saying that a large army is not needed to maintain local security or defend against foreign invasion. These troops consume huge amounts of food and only increase the local economic burden. It is said that the Muslims have petitioned Chairman Zhang to divert the huge military expenditure to develop irrigation and highways in order to promote the sale of grains, fruits, carpets, leather, and furs. The Turkic Uyghurs account for at least 75 percent of the four million people in the new province. In addition to the 150,000 "outsider" Chinese, such as administrative officials, shopkeepers, and technicians in the major cities, the rest are Muslims. These Muslims have always been united in terms of ethnicity and religion, and they have become even stronger recently due to the Ili rebellion. Workers in the new province are now holding elections for representatives to the provincial and county councils in accordance with the provisions of the Dihua Treaty.

Muslim rebels now completely control the most prosperous area in the northwest of Xinjiang Province, while the National Government controls the vast territory in the south, which is full of fertile land. The residents there also enjoy autonomy, but they lack water, roads, and clothing.

If the National Government can provide Zhang Zhizhong with the necessary support and the Ili rebel government can allow him to obtain oil, coal, and other resources west of the Manas River, then Zhang will be able to correct the shameful situation created by Sheng Shicai's tyranny. If Zhang can meet the simplest needs of the desert herders and the farmers in the fertile land and relieve them of the heavy burden of supplying large troops, then the disturbances that have occurred in southern Xinjiang can be quelled immediately.

The loess soil of southern Xinjiang's fertile land produces wheat, sugarcane, millet, melons, corn, grapes, and apples. Tens of thousands of cattle, sheep, and horses graze on the grasslands at the foot of the mountains.

Building a modern highway across Xinjiang Province can make the poor new province prosperous and at the same time ensure China's gateway to the western border.

### Sunday Forum Public Health is a Kind of War

— Zhou Shang

Written After the National Public Health Administration Conference

The War of Resistance is a great reformer. Individual interests are subordinate to public needs. In the process of resisting the war, when striving for victory, our men and women sacrifice for the public benefit. The War of Resistance is over, and the simple goal of victory has disappeared. New purposes and new goals must be found. Here is a goal that must undoubtedly be chosen, and that goal is health. Fight for health, unite people from all regions to fight together for health. This affects the life of each of us and the happiness of the whole. Everyone should participate in a part of this war.

Public health is a science, an art, and also a kind of war. All countries in the world should participate in this war and become the United Nations. Its enemies are sometimes a bacterium or a filterable virus, sometimes a flea, sometimes a fly or a mosquito, a dog or a rat. Sometimes it is an inanimate chemical substance. Sometimes it is a product of human brains and hands. Sometimes, however, it is ourselves.

The war of public health is not only in hospitals and laboratories, not only by the bedside of patients. Its battlefield is in the Senate, in the Executive Yuan, in factories, in mines, in fields of raw food, in shops of bagged food, in kitchens, in laundries, in schools, in families. When the sewers are broken, the garbage is piled up, and the enemies in the dirt appear, the war begins. There are too many enemies of hygiene to guard against, so we must always be vigilant and prepared for small skirmishes.

The strategic objective of this war is simple and clear, but there are many possible battle routes. Currently, China is fighting this war, and there seem to be the following emergency response routes: (1) Dirtiness, (2) Ignorance, (3) Poverty

The first front is a frontal war with dirtiness as the position:

The most problematic aspect of hygiene in our country is dirtiness. Dirtiness wastes human lives, dirtiness weakens national strength, dirtiness damages morality, and dirtiness lowers national dignity. We live in uncleanness every day, urinating and spitting everywhere. Dead cats, dead rats, food scraps, garbage, poultry and fish bones, vegetable and fruit peels, are all destined for the streets. Inland cities are like mud bodhisattvas squatting one by one, lined with large, small, broken, and good dung tanks. On one side, rice is washed and vegetables are washed, and on the other side, chamber pots are washed and night soil is poured. Horses, cattle, sheep, chickens, dogs, and pigs live and sleep together with people. Left over from the barbaric era, the streets, "one street of mud when it rains, three feet of dust when there is no wind," are filled with pigs and people racing ahead of each other. In major international cities, the intersection of sewers collapses many houses, and the heart of the city is allowed to have sewage flowing for a long time, and the stench fills the sky. The surroundings are covered with garbage dumps and dead things, allowing bacteria to freely breed and spread. In May, the garbage in Shanghai accumulated to 12,000 tons. How can it not make the millions of citizens who live and work there shudder?

On the personal side, mange, sore eyes, impetigo, scabies, etc., are prevalent in large and small societies throughout the year. Lice, head lice, fleas, bedbugs, mosquitoes, and flies are too numerous to count. Golden teeth, a full face of beard, long hair, a black neck, greasy clothes, digging nostrils in front of people, scratching thighs, and then sending snot to the door. Lice disturb the body all day long, and when caught, they are leisurely sent to the mouth, and the lips and teeth are constantly buzzing. Dr. Rocloff personally saw his successor catch eighty-nine in one minute.

Now we urgently need to universally establish a tap water system. Japanese-style public baths, hold cleaning campaigns, brushing campaigns, and at the same time build ditches in the countryside. Professor L. Bonmer said, "The benefit of a ditch to the countryside can be compared to the country's opening of the Panama or Suez Canal." Sanitary engineering is indeed the main infantry of this rare war. However, those who are familiar with sanitary engineering in our country are as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. The proposal to set up sanitary engineering scholarships at this sanitary administration conference is worth promoting.

The second is to fight ignorance with a left-wing flanking attack. Ignorance is stupidity, and stupidity is most likely to ruin things. Half of all kinds of bad things are knowingly committed by intelligent and clever people, and half are unintentionally caused by ignorant and stupid people. Bad things in hygiene are brewed by ignorance. Superstition is the deadly enemy of health, and superstition comes from stupidity. Because our education is backward and hygienic knowledge is not popularized, we are still in this primitive era, and we still regard illness as abuse by demons, and seek gods and ask for divination. We have not yet passed the Stone Age of 12,000 years before the Christian era, and we do not know how many lives, large and small, have been harmed. It endangers the biological foundation of the nation and shakes the foundation for building the country. We should use the army of hygienic education to fight. After the victory, the first National Sanitary Administration Conference decided to strengthen hygienic propaganda and set up scientific, technical and hygienic education propaganda agencies in the health care business group. This is the vanguard of hygiene, an indispensable method for enlightening the people's wisdom.

Professor Wilson G. Smillie of Public Health at Harvard University emphasized the importance of educational policy in controlling malaria. He said: "The malaria control program cannot be successful unless the people fully understand the principles of transmission and prevention of this disease." Before implementing school hygienic education and public hygienic education, doctors and nurses should first understand hygienic education. This is not a matter of knowledge, but a matter of attitude. Today we have 30,289 medical personnel, including 13,40 physicians and 5,997 nurses. We hope that they will unite with teachers across the country to be hygienic ambassadors and hygienic teachers. We must educate children and unborn mothers. We must educate her during childbirth. After childbirth, we must educate both mothers and children. We must educate children from infancy to school, educate during school, educate out of school and into the workplace, and then re-educate them from time to time in adulthood. Remember, we don't have enough doctors and nurses to treat diseases, let them be healthy.

This homework is simple. Clean fresh air, good food, hard work, adequate rest, holidays, reasonable and not superstitious, scientific and not fatalistic, we must find out what people know, how they learn, how ignorant they are, we must educate them in schools, in families, on radio stations, films, slogans, newspapers.

The third right-wing battlefield is opened in terms of poverty: poverty is the great enemy of health. The causes of poverty are disease, unemployment, old age, and large families. These problems are all mutually causal with poverty. Other people's bodies are strong and their spirits are sufficient to produce everything better than us, and we will unilaterally dump other people's things. After our victory, we hear that export trade failed and caused unemployment; the transfer of business due to unemployment is a bad phenomenon of domestic political planning and organization. Because we are unhealthy, we are prone to aging and old age. Not only can we not produce, but we must also sell. The difference between one in and one out is naturally great. In large families, there are many tired, disabled, few born, and many who eat. How can we not be poor?

The poor cannot get her medical treatment and recuperation when they are sick, and countless people die unjustly when they should not. The poor usually live in crowded houses, where the land is narrow and the people are crowded, diseases breed, and they eat one scoop of water and one basket of rice. How can they not starve to death? After the victory, the housing shortage is terrible, and prices are jumping like wild horses. Excellent nationals are inevitably drowned in the torrents of reverse elimination and reverse selection.

People should have adequate housing at reasonable rents, and the country should have good plans to treat the symptoms and root causes, and it is even more necessary to eliminate slums. As for food, everyone should have adequate quality and quantity, especially pregnant women, nursing mothers, children under five, and school children need first-class nutrients. This means giving them sufficient vitamins, high-grade proteins, and minerals. This is not a waste, but a need. We are so poor that we cannot give it away for free. At least we must supply it at a low price. This requires controlling food prices and supplementing food production when necessary. This is the national food plan, controlling the market and distribution, so that money must be the servant of people, and absolutely, absolutely not let money be the master.

Our country's public health itself is already anemic and has no money to nourish it. From 1940 to this year, the total national annual budget (in thousands of yuan) was 2,915,621,560, and the sanitary expenditure was 3,668,845, accounting for 0.126, that is, only 126 yuan out of 1,000 yuan spent by the country was spent on sanitation. Let's see how the situation in the two countries of England and India is:

England 1934-1935 India 1931-1932

National population 46,680,000 271,580,000

National income

Pounds 3,700,000,000 Rupees 16,890,000,000

National currency 59,200,000,000 National currency 21,112,500,000

Medical expenses

Pounds 75,000,000 Rupees 40,800,000

National currency 1,200,000,000 National currency 510,000,000

Medical expenses as a percentage of total government expenditure 7.97 1.85

Public health expenditure

Pounds 27,000,000 Rupees 17,400,000

National currency 1,872,000,000 National currency 20,750,000

Public health expenditure as a percentage of total government expenditure 12.430 0.79

We cannot help but feel ashamed when we compare ourselves with them. We are far behind England, and even India is inferior. There is a Western saying, "Public Health is. Purchasable." With such public health today, if we compare the amount of money with the results, it is already a great success. In the past, in the era of "I am the country," the national budget was based on income and expenditure. In today's democratic era, it should be based on expenditure and income. The former means doing as much as possible with as much money as possible, while the latter means taking as much money as possible to do as much as possible. Public health is a matter of life and death, and the poor people will definitely take out this money.

This war is not only the responsibility of hygienists and doctors, but it is our responsibility. We know the purpose, we have a strategy, as long as we unite our will with all our strength, we can win the war. (Capital, 8 November 1946)

### Mother Education

— Jin Xieshan

...To know the children of twenty years from now, just look at the mothers of today!

It is not difficult for us to find in history that some great figures have been greatly influenced by their mothers, and thus can promote society and add glory to the country and nation; but at the same time, we can also see that some unfilial sons are not without a major relationship with mother education.

The ancient books say: "Raising without teaching is the father's fault, and teaching without strictness is the teacher's laziness." It seems that the creation of all the child's bad behaviors has nothing to do with the mother. Teaching should be done by the father, but may I ask how much time a father can spend educating his children under the current social system? My intention is not to shirk the responsibility of all fathers, but to explain that fathers may have too little time to educate their children—and mothers can almost be said to be with their children all day long. Even a mother of a school-age child probably has more time to contact her child than her father. Moreover, the mother's warmth and kindness and the father's sternness, and who the child likes to be close to, are also natural results. (Closeness is the opportunity to naturally instill education.) We cannot arbitrarily say that warmth and kindness are not enough to educate children, then the importance of the mother's responsibility for raising children can also be seen here.

Since the responsibility of women is so important, let's open our eyes and look at the crowd who are now respecting their mothers!

Without any statistics, we can know that the majority of our country's women are still trapped in the misery of illiteracy. They lack knowledge and have no fresh minds; the upper classes while away their years playing cards, and the lower classes increase the excitement of life by gossiping. We can still find village women cursing in the streets in several alleys in Shanghai. Ignorance, stupidity, and all unwise actions still exist in too many families. In a temple on Nanjing Road, the most bustling street in Shanghai, the first and fifteenth days of the lunar month are still chaotic and lively. Although some people say that most of them are "businesswomen," there are still many housewives among them. Isn't this enough to show the sadness of the future of Chinese women's education?

The sadness of the future of women's education is also the sadness of children. Mr. Lu Xun once said: "To know the country twenty years from now, just look at the children of today." But we might as well say: "To know the children of twenty years from now, just look at the mothers of today!"

The amount of time mothers spend with their children has already been said above. Children are rich in imitation. The child spends more time with the mother. Undoubtedly, the influence of the mother must also be the greatest. But many mothers are in a pitiful state of no education, how can we not be sad for our children and sad for our country?

The need for women's education is self-evident, and this call has already been shouted. However, in view of the lack of standard mothers and the lack of great success in women's education, what we need to shout urgently now is that all women need re-education—the education of mothers; how to be a standard mother can indeed be listed as a specialized subject! If the government can run a mother's specialty school, it is not a superfluous move to create something new compared to a bride school.

### Old Maid

— Translated by Yu Jing from the Mainland News, original by Dorothy Dix

Although women have achieved a state of liberation, they still cannot escape a major shackle, that is, they must get married. A woman without a husband is the symbol of her failure as a woman. Of course, in the past, marriage was the only noble profession for women. Husbands and lipsticks were as necessary as husbands. Husbands were not only meal tickets, but also admission tickets to social occasions. A woman without a husband is unfortunate and is abandoned in the darkness outside the door of luck, where there is a group of crying, angry "leftovers."

But today everything is gradually changing. The door of opportunity is equally open to men and women. They can choose any profession they like, and the ability to earn money individually is only limited by their ability to do things. Happy unmarried women are the most welcome guests, but the average old maid, even if she is wearing rings on her hands and gold chains on her feet, will still be ashamed that she does not have a wedding ring on her hand.

If every marriage certificate is a certificate of happiness, you can naturally understand why women pursue it; if a woman is madly in love with a man, you can also understand why she pursues him until she gets him. But millions of women get married every year, and none of the above reasons make them shoulder the heavy responsibility of marriage.

They are not victims of great passion, they are not like poets who say: "Without love, the world is over." They cannot find the heroes of their girlhood dreams in vulgar youths. Often he does not meet some of their requirements for a husband, but they would rather marry the only man they have seen than endure the shame of having the word "Miss" engraved on their tombstones.

Working women marry not because of the illusion that they can sit back and enjoy themselves after getting a husband. She can remember that the female colleague at the writing desk next door used to buy clothes in French fashion stores, but now that she is married, she can only buy in lower-class stores. She also often has to help her sister pay the rent and buy shoes for her children.

The price of wedding batches is extremely high, and women continue to woo them. Even if they are not madly in love, they still get married, perhaps without even knowing why. Not a day goes by that I don't receive letters from women asking how and where to find a husband, or how to choose one from two or three men, and the author really has no bias towards any of them.

Many women do not marry for love, nor do they hope to live comfortably after marriage, but they are so determined to get married, which is incomprehensible to anyone. My opinion is that they are still victims of traditional shackles and would rather be called a wife than an old maid.

### Nanny

— Yan Ying

In the extravagant Shanghai, wealthy wives are infatuated with the enjoyment of material things. In order to avoid the trouble of breastfeeding, they mostly hire nannies to do it for them. The mothers never think about whether the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. In addition, due to the vanity of the mothers, hiring nannies has become a symbol of wealthy families.

Secondly, there are general working women, for their own careers. They have no choice but to hand over the responsibility of breastfeeding to the nanny. Their motives may not be impure, but in the balance of gains and losses, and considering the spiritual cultivation of their children, I am afraid that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages.

Maternal love is great. Mothers should give spiritual nourishment in the process of nurturing and educating their children, and build the path of cultivation in their children's small minds. However, with the employment of nannies, the infusion of maternal love loses many opportunities, and the nannies often give the young masters an undue indulgence, thus forming an objective environment of doting or indulgence. In addition, most nannies come from poor families. Due to the limitations of work and hygiene, they rarely have sound bodies. More dangerously, they may have latent infectious diseases, and the brain of Yulu may also affect the children. We can often see many shrewd parents, but their children become very rough, and this is often the reason.

In short, from all aspects, hiring a nanny is the most worthless thing. For the happiness of the family and the future of the children, we should abandon the bad habit of hiring nannies unless it is unavoidable due to our own illness, etc.

### Identification of Wool Yarn

— Fei Wen

Must compare and research when purchasing

Wool yarn has become a clothing necessity for every family, because its advantages are softness, warmth, and lightness. After wearing it, it can be disassembled, washed, and remade.

Here are a few ways to identify the quality of wool yarn that can be used when purchasing wool yarn:

(1) Softness test: We pick up the wool yarn and put it on the nose or cheek. Good quality wool yarn will produce a warm and soft feeling, while poor quality wool yarn will have a stiff feeling.

(2) Tensile test: We pull apart a twist of wool yarn and pull it hard. Good quality wool yarn can be pulled longer and very naturally.

(3) Elasticity test. Elasticity is a necessary condition for wool yarn, because without elasticity, the wool yarn shirt that is knitted will not be soft at all. To test the elasticity, you can take out a thread and stretch it with both hands. Good quality wool yarn has great elasticity, while poor quality wool yarn has little elasticity.

Recently, so-called Australian wool yarn has been discovered on the market, but it is actually manufactured by informal wool yarn factories in Shanghai, and it is nothing more than a fake trademark. You must know this when purchasing wool yarn.

### Pasting Matchboxes

— Ba Ling

Side business of rural women

Speaking of the side business of rural women, this is also a matter worthy of attention for those who care about women's lives. As far as I know, the side businesses of rural women, such as those in Minhang, Zhoupu, Chuansha, and Nanqiao in the suburbs of Shanghai, are mostly pasting matchboxes as their only side business when they are not busy with farming. According to a survey: At present, rural women paste about 1,000 matchboxes a day, then their remuneration is only 800 yuan in legal currency, and the raw materials for pasting matchboxes—paste—must also be prepared by themselves. Women with nimble hands can paste up to 5,000 matchboxes a day from dawn to dusk, and the remuneration they receive is only 4,000 yuan in legal currency. Under the circumstances of such high living costs, it is impossible for a rural woman to maintain the lives of a family of three or four with the income from pasting matchboxes.

According to a friend who is familiar with the matchbox industry, the rural women who paste matchboxes as a side business are, to put it bluntly, pitiful victims of exploitation. Because at present, the holders of this industry in various towns and villages in the suburbs of Shanghai will never get such meager remuneration from various match factories in Shanghai; however, they take advantage of the weakness of general rural women who have nothing to do during their spare time to exploit them in order to enrich themselves. This is indeed an unreasonable and inhumane thing.

Therefore, how to promote the proper side business of rural women to improve their lives is a fact that the women's community and people who care about women's issues should not ignore at present.

### A Stepmother's Heart

— Feng

My marriage took place in the autumn of two or three years ago, when I was already thirty years old. Viewed through the eyes of conventional society, it was not an ideal or complete marriage, because I inevitably had to accept the compromise of becoming a second wife due to my advanced age, and my husband's late wife had also left behind a four-year-old child!

But in reality, I wasn't disappointed. I didn't see being a second wife as an incomplete marriage, nor did I resent the fact that my husband's late wife had left behind a troublesome child. I only harbored one belief and resolution: I must make my marriage happy; I must break down the prejudiced notion, inherited from the past, that stepmothers are cruel and mistreat the children of their husband's former wife. I want to be a loving stepmother!

This is not an easy task, because in the context of traditional beliefs, stepmothers have been unconsciously stereotyped as vicious and biased. In the ears of neighbors and in the minds of relatives and friends, your every move will be watched and criticized. But driven by love, and wanting to be an outstanding stepmother, I bravely shouldered this heavy burden!

Our marriage was joyful, both spiritually and materially. My husband has a kind and honest soul. He is a gentle and caring man, and my habits are similar to his. I believe this kind of marriage is often more perfect, because I have seen so much unrest and suffering between couples due to differences in character and temperament, to the point where they cannot understand each other. On this point, I am fortunate. The most serious problem lay with Ming, the child left behind by his former wife.

I will always remember the scene when my husband told Ming to call me "Mom" for the first time after our marriage. Ming was wearing a new woolen sweater, and he slowly ran to me, holding his father's hand. Although his father told him to call me "Mom" several times, he didn't respond, but stared at me with his round, big eyes! Finally, his father seemed annoyed and said, "If you don't call her, I won't like you anymore!" He was startled, and a shadow of pain swept across his face. As if he could no longer bear the grievance, he burst into tears in his father's arms. Poor child, though still young, already knew the pain of losing his mother. A child's emotions are genuine, and I was moved by him. I took his hand, hugged him, caressed his soft hair lovingly, and gently and tenderly whispered in his ear: "Don't cry, Ming. I like you just like your mom did!" Before long, he stopped sobbing, slowly raised his pitiful, red, tearful eyes, and softly called out, "Mom!" After calling out, he threw himself into my arms again! Sincere emotions cannot be forced. As I held him, I felt the special feelings in his little heart at that time, and I felt deeply moved. I couldn't allow his already fearful and sad heart to be hurt any further. I loved him even more than I would love my own child!

From then on, the affection between us, mother and son, grew more harmonious and intimate day by day. First impressions often leave an indelible mark on people! I love him! In my free time, I knit him woolen sweaters. He never acts naughty, and never asks to buy this or buy that. In the evenings, when the three of us sit together chatting or listening to music, he sits obediently on his father's lap or lies in my arms, and our lives become even more perfect. I know that many husbands worry about the fate of the children left behind by their former wives. Of course, they don't dare to say it directly in front of their new partner, fearing that it will cause discord between them, but when they think of their former wife, they feel a deep sense of guilt. That kind of spiritual pain and unease is something outsiders cannot imagine. And my husband, seeing the closeness and harmony between us, I believe, knows those fears have been put to rest!

A year later, my own child was born, but I did not neglect him because of this. On the contrary, I felt that if I showed any bias at this time, it would easily be criticized. I cared for him as I always had. I didn't want him to be reminded of the pain of not having a mother when he saw his younger brother being loved by his mother. For the sake of harmony and affection between the two brothers in the future, I should build a solid foundation of righteousness for them!

Now my child is two years old, and Ming is gradually acting like an older brother. He always shares half of what he eats with his younger brother. In my loving care, there are no boundaries between them! Now, whenever I hear Ming affectionately calling "Younger brother," or see them holding hands and swaying together while playing on the grass, my heart is filled with an unspeakable joy and peace. I hope all the children left behind by their mothers will be blessed. I sincerely bless them!

Spring and Autumn

### Oscar Wilde and America

— Wang Rui

Recently, Hesketh Pearson's new book, "Oscar Wilde: His Life and Wit," is a vast, bold and delightful read. It is arguably the most complete and faithful critical biography of the genius writer Oscar Wilde in recent years. The book describes many interesting stories about Wilde and is so concise and engaging that one cannot bear to put it down.

In one section, Pearson describes Wilde's trip to America, briefly conveying a glimpse of the great writer's views on the largest modern power. Some people advised George Bernard Shaw to visit the United States, but Shaw politely declined, perhaps influenced by Wilde. Wilde's trip to America was brief, but Pearson believes his criticisms were spot-on. The keenness of a genius's perception seems nothing short of a miracle to the average person.

It is said that Wilde arrived in the United States in 1882 and immediately began a lecture tour. The Broadway theater world presented him with a bouquet of pure lilies. Although he did not accept them, much to the dismay of his butler, the extravagance of his attire was unparalleled. His witty remarks to reporters made his lecture tour a resounding success. The most powerful and memorable of his public pronouncements were the few words he spoke to a customs officer at the New York docks. The customs officer asked, "Do you have anything to declare?" He replied, "I have nothing to declare but my genius."

Wilde's trip to America was akin to a form of revenge for Mark Twain's trip to Europe. After traveling in Europe, Mark Twain published his "Innocents Abroad," frankly mocking what he called high European culture. Wilde mocked America with the same frankness, saying that America had almost no culture to speak of.

He said: "In America, life is one long, dreadful penance." "The first thing that struck me as unreasonable was the American habit of hanging pictures close to the fireplace. When I understood the benefits of this custom, I realized how bad those paintings were."

"The general shallowness of American business and its unfair attitude towards spiritual culture are due to a heretical doctrine in this country, namely, that in America, a man is not fit to be a national hero if he is unable to tell a convincing lie."

The governor of Kriegsville County telegraphed him: "Would you be willing to visit our town and give a lecture on aesthetics?"

Wilde telegraphed back: "Please change the name of your county first."

The name Kriegsville was simply too ugly.

When students at Harvard University listened to Wilde's lectures, they wore shorts and adorned themselves with sunflowers or lilies. Wilde stood firmly on the podium, adjusting his breathing, while wearing a tuxedo. This made the boys feel a little silly, but when he said that he "seemed to see signs of some kind of artistic movement in the classroom," the boys laughed and showed him their warm respect. His warning, "Caricature is vulgarity's tribute to genius," shocked the entire audience.

Wilde's criticisms of all writers were gentle and tolerant, unwilling to needlessly wound the self-esteem of writers. The harshest of his criticisms was a sentence he said to the American painter James Whistler, who, although he had considerable and magnificent achievements, was an extreme egotist. He said: "Whistler seems to me to be one of the masters. I dare say Whistler agrees with my opinion entirely."

This was originally very kind, but once, the art critic for the London Times reviewed Whistler's paintings, saying that in his opinion, this painting was good and that painting was bad, and so on.

Whistler was resentful and said: "Dear friend, you shouldn't say this painting is good and that painting is bad. Good and bad are not the words you should use. But you can say, 'I like this one, I don't like that one.' That's what you're supposed to do. Now come and eat oysters—you'll love them."

"I wish I had said that," Wilde said generously and happily, praising Whistler.

"You can, Oscar, you can," Whistler replied excitedly.

Later, when Wilde mediated the war of words between the painter and the journalist, he said: "Whistler often uses the capital letter 'I' to piece together his works of art."

Shallow people who try to destroy the words and deeds of great writers are equally rude. From New York to San Francisco, many drunkards forced him to indulge in lavish drinking. But every time he drank, he always managed to get those who surrounded him dead drunk, and then, like dead pigs, he piled them one by one into carriages and triumphantly drove the carriages back to his hotel.

Miners in Colorado treated him to a tour of the depths of a gold mine. Wilde praised these miners, saying that their clothes were the best in America. Inside the mine, he told the miners: "Let's sit down and have a feast. The first course is whiskey, the second course is also whiskey, and the third course is still whiskey." The miners were drunk and fell asleep until the sun came up, while Wilde may have already been in another social gathering, talking eloquently, as if attending a London tea party.

### Poetic Words

— Bin Jia

A noble will and a pure soul often move people more deeply and lastingly than beautiful shapes and sculpted words. —The poet's attitude is always one of enduring hardship.

### Ancient Art of Persia

— Liu Shi

Persia, which is today's Iran, has been a country of poets, philosophers, and mystics for centuries. However, in recent years, most people talk about Persian art only in terms of its rugs. Although Persian rugs are famous, they are impractical. The Persians had already created beautiful molded pottery and exquisite fabrics four thousand years before the birth of Christ. Persia, situated between the eastern and western hemispheres, was the center of Near Eastern culture, and it had its brilliant achievements in science, such as astronomy and mathematics, and in art, such as metalwork and pottery.

Persian art is an integral part of the daily life of the Persians. They were gifted in beautifying the bowls they drank from, decorating the vases they used for flower arrangements, and even on the axes they used as weapons, they would try to make them very refined. Later, until 1000 BC, their saddles were also decorated with beautiful bronze ornaments. The carvings on these saddles were discovered in a tomb in western Persia in 1929. The steeds were usually buried in the same tomb as their masters. The bodies of women were often buried in a large bottle.

The beginning of Persian history is marked by its art, which reached its peak in 550 BC. Under the rule of Cyrus the Great and Darius, Persia conquered all the land from the Nile to the Aegean Sea, building the first world empire. In their newly acquired territories, they built monumental structures, decorated with impressive sculptures, and filled with colorful utensils. In 330 BC, they were conquered by Alexander the Great and absorbed ancient Greek culture. Nine hundred years later, the Arabs invaded, and they gained new concepts in mathematics and astronomy. In the thirteenth century, the Mongols entered the Near East, and they were influenced by the great Chinese painters, but the Persians still absorbed and transformed things into their own. They learned new concepts from the Chinese and used bright colors on pottery. Until the fifteenth century, when European art entered the height of the Renaissance, Persian art reached a peak of elegance and refinement that had never been surpassed. The attached image is one of the bronze sculptures on a saddle, depicting the sun god riding a lion, representing the power of the universe. It was cast around 1000 BC.

### Poem Tiles: Continuing the Yangzhou Dream, No. 6

— Hong Weifa

The past Yangzhou scenery written in Li Dou's "Yangzhou Painting Boat Records" has vanished like a spring dream. However, the poem tiles mentioned in it were used by the author and Ren Erbei and others as their only pastime after work fifteen years ago, and they spent a lot of time on them.

Regarding poem tiles, the "Painting Boat Records" records it this way:

"Poem tiles are made of ivory, half an inch square. Each person gets dozens or hundreds of characters, and they put them together to form poems. It is most difficult and ingenious. The Xiu Garden and Xiao Garden were most popular. Recently, the verses commonly circulated are: Zhang Sike said: 'The boat oar is afraid of being blown away by the wind, the tower is suspected of being breathed into existence.' The monk Yaogen said: 'Rainy window talks about ghosts, the lamp dims first, the tavern discusses swords, and suddenly there is a sound.' Huang Beizha said: 'The flowing water must be the meaning of the exiled, the setting sun is all the soul of a beauty.' Wang Rongfu said: 'Leaves fall, words exhaust the poor alley, lotus decays, sweeping half the lake.' All are witty sayings."

At that time, Ren Erbei was in charge of the Provincial Zhenzhong in Zhenjiang, and the author was working there. When we talked about the poem tiles in the "Painting Boat Records" in our spare time, we were very interested and decided to make a set to try. However, if we used ivory, we were not wealthy salt merchants and it was impossible. If we used bamboo instead, it would be troublesome and unsightly. As a result, we cut corners and used the Xuan paper that was used to print business cards. Moreover, we did not use a square shape, but changed it to a rectangle, with one character written on each card, almost like the paper cards used by ordinary people.

After the paper poem tiles were made, everyone did not agree with the method of "each person getting dozens or hundreds of characters, and they put them together to form poems," thinking that it was too rigid and lacked change. Anyway, it was called "tiles," so it would be more accurate to use the method of playing mahjong. So we decided on new tile rules: (1) The entire set of tiles has 300 characters, with nouns, verbs, pronouns, adverbs, prepositions, etc. all included. (2) At least two people and at most six people per game. (3) The starting tile and dealing are both in order of seating. (4) The first player starts with fourteen tiles, and the rest have thirteen tiles. (5) If the whole game agrees, the tiles can be reshuffled and restarted. (6) You can collect tiles issued by others in order. (7) In addition to the 300 tiles, there are several blank tiles. Each person can keep one blank tile to represent any desired character. If you get a second blank tile, you must discard it. (8) A completed set of tiles has up to ten characters, and up to fourteen characters at most. (9) The sentence structure of the completed set of tiles can be three-character, four-character, five-character, seven-character, or sentences of varying lengths. (10) If most of the people in the same game deny the sentence of the completed set of tiles, the completion of the tiles should be temporarily stopped and the original game should continue. (11) After one person completes a set of tiles, the remaining people can use all the tiles they have to complete sentences, and record them in order of merit.

Once the tile rules were decided, the tile characters also had to be determined. Initially, the author selected more than 1,000 commonly seen characters, which were repeatedly deleted by everyone, leaving 300 characters. Among them, there were the most nouns, followed by verbs and adjectives, and the fewest other parts of speech. After multiple experiments, it was sufficient to be used quickly, so we did not add any more.

From then on, in our spare time, whether we stayed in Zhenjiang on the Iron Pi City Head, or returned to Yangzhou by the Ping Shan Hall, it was mostly a game of poem tiles. In the beginning, everyone's skills were not skilled, and their associations were not flexible. Dealing and collecting tiles often backfired and took a lot of time. Later, it gradually sped up. It took less than an hour to complete a game. After each game was completed, it was recorded at the time, and there were many verses that could be recited, such as "Smoke shrouds the willow threads and adds to the green in the distance, rain rolls the river sails and scatters into the building." "Pitiable is a song of the Peach Blossom Fan, all are new pavilion old tears." "Jade flute softly sings and idly faces wine, setting sun red leaves coldly silent." "Leaving feelings, the wind scatters the leaves, half of spring, a sail is far away." "Smoky flowers pity the dream of parting, wind leaves fill the empty mountain." "Flowing water is pitiable and green, orioles and flowers are another late spring." …

Later, because the "January 28th" national crisis occurred, everyone no longer had the refined interest to play this poem tile game, and not long after, everyone became distressed and separated. Only Erbei was able to suppress his parting feelings after the trial, and compiled the tile rules, tile characters, and poems composed in each game into a volume, mimeographed and sent to the colleagues in the game, named "New Words of the Leaf Game." And on the title page of the volume, he inscribed a quatrain: "Turn new leaves to fight leisure, from then on boredom becomes famous; the best are the new words in the game, setting sun red leaves coldly silent." A postscript was attached: "This collection is completed, but there is no name for it, so I suggest four characters, and jokingly titled a quatrain, nothing but a fascination with the game. However, the word 'game' is not popular, and there are no old articles, what day will there be new words, its creation is laughably so." At that time, the author also wrote a poem in response: "Pitiable life is entrusted to leisure, twisting broken chants and waves to win fame; since the west wind blew and the rain passed, the cicadas and fallen leaves are all silent." Afterwards, Erbei re-edited it and renamed it "Record of Lost Ambition," and the paper poem tiles were printed and published together. Detractors naturally still saw it as "fascination with the game." But times change, and as for today, wanting to gather together again, playing poem tiles, to relieve worldly worries, how can we get it again? This is truly continuing the Yangzhou dream!

### An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of Blood 97

— Ye Jingfeng

(Previous plot summary) During the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, millions of heroic Chinese sons and daughters in our country's rear and occupied areas shed their bright red blood over every inch of mountains and rivers in order to defend their motherland. We have collected these tragic stories to commemorate the hardships of recovering lost land.

The first story—"The Seven Secret Agreements"—recounts how the Japanese pirates colluded with several war demons of Europe, signing seven secret documents to trample on the entire world and destroy all culture.

The young man, Tsurumi Tama, received a purely Japanese education from the cradle to graduation from the Army War College. Perhaps due to his pure bloodline, he was full of a sense of justice and couldn't stand the Japanese pirates' style of poverty—rape, looting, burning, killing, gambling, drug trafficking, extortion, and various criminal behaviors. Just as he was beginning to feel disgusted, he accidentally discovered that he was actually a direct descendant of Mr. Zhan Jihan, an old Chinese Tongmenghui comrade. At the same time, he heard rumors of the "Seven Secret Agreements," so he used his position in the Japanese General Staff Headquarters to recruit comrades and organize twelve secret radio stations to try to reveal the contents of the "Seven Secret Agreements" in an attempt to save the world from this catastrophe.

During the course of his secret work, he discovered that he was in love with a proud and extraordinary Northeastern girl, Ji Yaoqun. Fearing that falling into a love affair would delay his grand plan, he returned to the homeland with a spirit of certain death and plunged into the dragon's den and tiger's lair that was the Black Dragon Society to carry out the work of exploring the "Seven Secret Agreements"...

Volume One: The Seven Secret Agreements

Chapter Six: A Beautiful Figure in the Black Dragon Society

Not far from here is Tokyo Imperial University. The clock on the Hume Building has just chimed twelve times, indicating that it is now midnight and all daytime work should be finished. A certain club, a few dozen steps east of the Hume Building, has already seen its members leave in batches, leaving only the last person. He is wearing a neat tuxedo, looks no more than twenty years old, and the contours of his face bring out a standardized handsome man; the lines of his neck and jaw all delineate calmness and perseverance; the muscles and bones of his whole body grow evenly and harmoniously, making him appear even more energetic.

As he appeared on the mica steps at the entrance of the club, he saw his car, a 1935 Dodge, already silently gliding over from the left and stopping at the bottom of the steps. The driver got out of the car, opened the door, and waited there. He also looked up at the clear blue sky, the bright waning moon, and told his driver to wait for him at the main entrance of Ueno Park first, as he needed to take a walk. The driver bowed in response and drove the car away.

The young man lightly breathed a sigh of relief, and after the car had gone far away, he stepped down the steps and walked slowly eastward, as if admiring the night scenery. His pace was extremely slow, indicating that he was quite tired; this was because since flying across the strait from Shenyang the day before yesterday, he had been subjected to the secret "five-level test" day and night and had not had a good rest. At this time, he had completed all the subjects. If he didn't have extraordinary energy, he would have been too tired to move, but he still retained considerable vitality.

Why did he have to take this "five-level test?" It was just a secret procedure for joining the society: the first level of test is the word "loyalty." During the test, in addition to the six executive committee members with the highest qualifications, probing repeatedly with various questions, there are also very cruel tests. For example, a committee member asks you, "Killing is an act that violates national law and morality. If an executive committee member orders you to kill someone, and you actually kill someone, then that is deliberately breaking the law and doing evil; if you don't carry out the order, then you are violating the orders of the society. How do you solve this problem?"

— Shao Fu

Mei and Cheng Competing on Stage

Mei Lanfang and Cheng Yanqiu's performances in Shanghai this time have been described by some as a competition, with supporters of both sides cheering and shouting. Because their tastes differ, it is understandable that they support different performers. However, as one of the audience members, we welcome their competition on stage as much as possible. The reason is simple: there are good plays to watch.

It is said that Mei Lanfang is going to perform "The Drunken Concubine." Mei has not performed this play for ten years, which shows one aspect of his efforts to show all his skills.

Security Official Situ

There are many strange sights on Nanjing Road. A pair of stone figures by the racetrack is one, and the Rainbow Temple below the Rising Sun Building is another.

The official name of the Rainbow Temple is Security Official Situ Temple. Every time I pass by, seeing the prosperous incense burning and the huge golden plaque, I always think of Ambassador Situ Leideng, who traveled up and down Mount Lu many times to mediate, and I hope that he can also become a security official Situ.

Now, the ambassador has returned to Beiping and is refusing to see guests, probably because he is too tired from these months. The Nanjing Political Consultative Conference is still continuing. We hope that the ambassador can rest for a few days and then return to Nanjing to continue his efforts.

Licensing System

Imports and exports are no longer free. You must obtain a license to export or import.

Premier Song is fighting with speculators. Let everyone think about what new tricks will appear in the market.

### A True Story of Jeep

— Ma Ye

(Editor's note: This self-narration of a jeep introduces some common knowledge in a lighthearted tone, no joking.)

I, "Jeep" (temporarily using the name you cautiously use!), with ample facts and reasons, hereby send the following memorandum to all those who misunderstand me, despise me, curse me, and flatter me, as a serious protest. I, "Jeep," with ample evidence, hereby offer the following supplementary note to the repeated publication of my biography and falsely named confessions in "Free Talk." And a good faith proposal with "Human Life is Paramount."

Clarification

I am first ordered to clarify: "Jeep" is not my original name. According to my investigation, the two Chinese characters "吉普" (Jeep) originated from the American Information Service in the mountain city of Chongqing. This term is now "uniformly" popular throughout China. Although it is rare for a transliteration to be so "unchanging," I find it unacceptable. "Jeep" is clearly a transliteration of "Jeep," but I must state again: "Jeep" is also not my original name, my full name!

I have a very exaggerated and glorious original name, which is: "All-Purpose Vehicle," written in Western language as "General Purpose," because I can devote myself to many skills that other vehicles cannot. I not only transport soldiers, but also transport wounded soldiers, deliver letters, transport firearms, and can also serve as an independent wireless radio transceiver station, military telephone station, first aid small ambulance, field X-ray mobile station, small military repair shop,... There's too much to say, too many to count. President Roosevelt once stood on my back to review the troops. I carried the first batch of soldiers ashore at the Normandy landing; I could sleep in a B-25 transport plane and fly over the "Roof of the World." When the plane landed at Chongqing Airport, I used my own four legs (wheels) to slide down from the transport plane automatically and immediately serve. I can climb mountains, I can wade through water, I can fly, I can crawl through caves... In short, I am all-powerful, and I am worthy of the title "All-Purpose!"

All-Purpose

American veterans initially called me by my full and complete name very properly, but later they said my name was too long and cumbersome, so they abbreviated it to GP. Second, the two letters GP were said to be a little awkward to pronounce, so they changed it again to the abbreviation Geep. This is just like American veterans calling themselves GI. Although the word is shorter, it sounds a bit more affectionate. Since my original name is "All-Purpose Vehicle," I hope that when Chinese friendly people want to abbreviate my name, they will call me "Old Wan." Isn't "Wan" one of the "hundred surnames"? If you don't call me "Old Wan," you can call me

"Little Wan" is also fine, but don't confuse it with the poet's desire for "Little Man," remember, remember! Someone once suggested calling me "Jie," which is also quite acceptable and will be noted for future reference.

Speaking of my family tree: I am a member of my large family. All over the world, there are hundreds of millions of my brothers with the same face and body shape, but each does his own different job. Each person's skill (only picking up young masters and young ladies to school is a special "side job" in China). There are too many of my brothers, so we are not born of the same father and mother. In the United States, the "Ford Motor Company" is famous for its V-shaped eight-cylinder cars, the "Chrysler Company" for its luxury cars, the "Willys Company" for its four-seater small sedans, and the "General Motors Company" for its trucks... But during the war, these famous factories were all the parents of my brothers. In peacetime, "Ford" parts cannot be installed on "Chrysler" cars, nor can they be matched with "Willys" or "General Motors" cars. Only any of our brothers can exchange any piece of clothing. If they are unfortunately disabled, such as a broken arm or leg, a broken heart, the "internal organs" between our brothers can be freely exchanged, regardless of which factory their parents are from.

Parts

My design is the crystallization of American automotive industry design experts. Every part of me is manufactured by the factory that is best at manufacturing that type of part. For example, I have a pair of anti-aircraft eyes (anti-aircraft lights). Its light bulbs, covers, anti-aircraft colored glass, bubble heads... etc., are all manufactured separately by specialized factories.

I have strong resistance and shock resistance, and I also have sufficient speed to gallop. Although I can be controlled, unfortunately, I cannot be autonomous. Therefore, when the "Jeep girl" sitting on my back uses the scent of perfume, a nasal "um" tone of sweet words, and fluttering hair brushing against the driver's cheeks as a multifaceted charming offensive, you, the unfortunate ghosts under the car, appear in front of me. I pity you, you and I are equally innocent.

Please do not curse me and the Jeep girls. Because we and they are equally at the mercy of those adults adorned with badges, collar badges, and chest badges. We lose our freedom and autonomy... I have rumbled in my stomach and shed tears like rain for this:

But my heart is kind. I hope that the supervisors of vehicles will review the drivers, and drivers with conscience and reason will also automatically self-examine to see if their driving skills have reached the standard. Here, I sincerely list a most economical and reliable method, hoping that the vehicle-owning class will implement it immediately.

Please first measure the distance between my front and rear feet (front and rear tires) with a rope, take this measurement as the radius, and draw a circle with white powder on a flat square or a relatively wide and quiet alley floor. Then, measure the distance between my left and right feet (tires) with a rope, widen this measurement by one foot, and draw two straight lines on the previously drawn circle as the car's entrance and exit. In this way, please find someone to witness it, but only allow him to tell you to try again when you fail, and do not allow him to warn you in advance that your driving is about to deviate from the scope.

Driving

Everything is ready, please sit on my back, start me up and drive me into the circle between the two straight lines. You immediately brake and stop, reverse, turn the steering wheel, go forward, brake, and reverse again... In this way, no matter whether you come from the left or the right, my only requirement is that within five minutes, you turn me around in the circle, turn one hundred and eighty degrees, and drive out of the old road between the two straight lines when you drove into the circle. Of course, the front of the car should go first, and the rear of the car should follow.

If you can satisfy what I said above, then you are qualified to obtain a car driving license from any major city in the five continents. Please do not underestimate this famous and internationally used test question. If you fail, try again! If you don't succeed in ten days, aim for a month. Success will surely belong to you in the end.

If you have the above skills and still have an accident, I, "Old Wan," am willing to be crushed to pieces to atone for the crime!

Human life is paramount, and showing off is light. Speed is second, safety is first!

Common Sense

### On Extraterritoriality

— Wen Yi

Chinese people probably don't have a single person who doesn't feel disgusted by the term "extraterritoriality," but in fact, this is a misunderstanding. Extraterritoriality is not necessarily unequal, and many people often associate extraterritoriality with consular jurisdiction, but in reality, these are completely two different things.

There are two types of extraterritoriality:

(1) Equal extraterritoriality (Extra-territoriality) This type of extraterritoriality applies to foreign ambassadors and ministers, etc., who enjoy the following special rights (Privileges):

1 Diplomats themselves and their suites enjoy special treatment and protection.

2 Diplomatic embassies enjoy special protection.

3 Diplomats sometimes get to meet the heads of state of the host country and attend special banquets.

Those who enjoy this type of extraterritoriality are also exempt from the following obligations (Immunities):

1 Being subject to civil and criminal sanctions in the host country.

2 Not having to serve in the military in the host country, testify in court, etc.

Foreign commercial agents, such as consuls-general, consuls, and vice-consuls, do not enjoy extraterritoriality. However, if the host country provides special treatment, they may also enjoy the benefits of extraterritoriality.

(2) Unequal extraterritoriality (Exlra-territorality) applies to expatriates of the great powers stationed in the Far East (this type of extraterritoriality is only seen in the Far East). Unequal extraterritoriality includes two types:

1 Court jurisdiction (Courtisdiction) such as the special courts previously established by the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan in Shanghai.

2 Consular jurisdiction (ConsularJurisdiction) such as the foreign consuls who previously adjudicated civil and criminal cases in China before most countries established special courts.

Extraterritoriality (unequal) originated in the late Qing Dynasty, and the reason why the great powers wanted to obtain the benefits of extraterritoriality in China was actually due to the poor laws established in the late Qing Dynasty. For example, the law "those who kill shall die" seems to have no flaws, but in fact, it is fundamentally wrong. Foreign countries distinguish between murder (Murder) and manslaughter (Man-slaughter) and determine the severity of the crime, but Chinese old laws prescribe the death penalty for all killings, regardless of whether they are intentional or unintentional. Now let's take an example.

A hundred years ago, a British merchant ship trafficked opium to Guangdong and passed through the Humen Fort. While unloading goods from a sampan, a British sailor accidentally dropped a box of opium from the top floor, hitting a woman's head and killing her. As a result, the Chinese government strongly demanded that the ship surrender the murderer and execute him. Although the shipowner repeatedly explained that it was an accidental death and could not be sentenced to the death penalty, the British sailor was finally executed under the law of "those who kill shall die." This incident aroused criticism and attacks from British newspapers. In order to protect the lives of their expatriates, they had the motivation to demand "extraterritoriality" from China.

During the Washington Conference in 1921, when representatives of the nine countries gathered in Washington, the chief Chinese representative, Shi Zhaoji, proposed the abolition of extraterritoriality for the great powers in China. The representatives of all countries did not object to this proposal, but there was a condition attached: "China must improve its laws within a certain period of time, and after a delegation sent by various countries investigates and approves, the abolition will be carried out." After the Chinese representatives returned to China, they tried to improve the laws, but at that time, it was the era of warlord separatism, and it was quite difficult to improve the laws. After a long time, the investigation team repeatedly asked whether the improvement was complete. As a result, the Chinese government sent a telegram to prevent them from coming, and the matter of "abolishing extraterritoriality" was also shelved in an intangible way.

It was not until after the victory of this war that the extraterritoriality of the great powers in China was completely abolished. However, if we do not strive for self-improvement, all equal and mutually beneficial treaties will naturally deteriorate.

### The Newly Appointed Mayor of Nanjing, Shen Yi

— Changzhi

According to reports, the newly appointed Mayor of Nanjing, Mr. Shen Yi, flew from Shanghai to Nanjing on the 14th, took office on the 16th, and officially started his duties after holding the first memorial week on the 18th. This is the beginning of Nanjing's transformation from a "received city" to a "constructed city" after becoming the capital.

The construction of Nanjing will be a model for the construction of major cities across the country in the future, and in the case of many people, many opinions, little money, and few materials, building Nanjing and being the mayor of Nanjing is really difficult. We hope that Shen Yi can have extraordinary experience and courage to build Nanjing well and give a new impression to China and foreign countries. Here, I only introduce some of Shen Yi's anecdotes, and I don't want to praise him for how good he is here first. Whether he is good or not depends on the performance of the facts in the future.

When you are sitting in a car and pass from the bottom of North Sichuan Road through Jiangwan to the Qujiang Wharf in the city center, you will see wide, boundless, flat, smooth, and accessible asphalt roads... Neat trees... Great buildings lined up among them. This is the crystallization of the hard work of Mr. Shen Yi, the municipal construction practitioner of the "Greater Shanghai Construction Plan" before the Anti-Japanese War. If Mr. Shen can use his past experience to lead Nanjing, he may be able to be competent and happy.

Before the Anti-Japanese War, Mayor Shen served as the director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works for ten years. He was appointed as an "expert" and served under five mayors. Under the circumstances of national decline and the threat of strong neighbors, he engaged in practical work of municipal construction and was admired by all parties. He is an engineer. During the Anti-Japanese War, he presided over the water conservancy projects in Gansu Province in the rear and served as the director of the Ministry of Communications, assisting the government and participating in the overall anti-Japanese plan, implementing "nation-building politics," and making contributions to the anti-Japanese strategy. This is probably the main reason for his appointment as the mayor of Nanjing this time.

Recalling the year of victory, when the government authorities announced the list of administrative heads of the provinces and cities in the Northeast, they solemnly and sincerely announced to the people: "The Northeast has been occupied for a long time, and the main personnel are carefully selected domestic first-class construction talents." A year after the victory, the authorities believed that the municipal administration of Dalian had not been stabilized for a long time, so they sent Shen Yi to take over. This shows the importance the authorities attach to Mr. Shen. When he was in Dalian, the complex military and political problems in the Northeast had not been resolved, and it is difficult to determine his achievements. Now that Mr. Shen has been transferred to Nanjing, he can probably show his skills.

Regarding Nanjing, everyone knows that the inconvenience of transportation, the disorder of the streets, and the blockage of the sewers are the fatal injuries of the municipal administration. Of course, all these improvements must have money. However, we must never completely blame all the failures that have not been done on "money." The unpopularity of the former mayor of Nanjing stemmed from this.

Here, although there are only a few empty words, they are the general public's high hopes for Mr. Shen Yi. I think he will never disappoint the people!

### The Innocent Murderer 7

— Xu Guiting

Ruthann frowned and said, "But she'll call the police. She'll pretend to be asleep, and then call the police. You see, women always do that. But Mrs. Meane, I'm not saying you're treating me badly!".

"Even if she does, what's the big deal? You'll have to tell them sooner or later. I thought it was right to call them here now."

Ruthann leaned back in his chair, his hands still in his coat pockets, and said, "Now everything's clear. It's a pity I never got it clear before. My father made my mother suffer a lot, but I loved her very much. Of course, I'm an only child. But she was unfaithful to me, she was still messing around with him, so I killed him first, then shot her with a gun. Do you agree that this is a reasonable thing to do? I believe people in France approve of that."

"When did you shoot her with the gun?" Mean asked.

"Oh, many years ago," he smiled slyly, "The most interesting thing is: if she hadn't messed around with him, how would I have been born?" He looked at Mrs. Mean with what seemed like great affection and said, "This is what Mrs. Mean pointed out."

Bailey said calmly, "But I don't understand how Mrs. Ruthann got mixed up in it. I understand everything about your mother."

Ruthann's face seemed to collapse, expressing great pain, "I don't want to talk about my wife. She's a great kid. If anyone says she's not, he must be a nasty liar." After saying this, he turned to Meane, suddenly sneering, "It's very strange, why did you bother to listen to me talk about the Japanese ghosts? It's not important at all."

"I also thought that this might not be the whole story about you," Meane said, "I suspect you weren't happy to tell me everything before."

"Not so," Ruthann frowned, "Of course I wasn't happy to tell everything before things were clear." He then looked at Bailey, giving her a strangely affectionate smile, and said, "Sorry, I don't want to bore you anymore. Mr. Mean, if you're tired, you can go to sleep."

Bailey hesitated for a moment, forced a smile and said, "You don't mind? I feel a little sleepy."

"Of course not," Ruthann jumped up immediately, his hands still in his coat pockets. He stood silently, waiting until Bailey went out and closed the door. Then, he turned around and sneered: "I can bet you five dollars, she must have run out to call the police. Women always do the same thing. Of course I know, but she stared at me, just like a cat staring at a mouse, what can I do?" He sighed deeply, and at the same time took the gun out of his pocket.

Meane immediately said to him, "Ruthann, please give me the gun!"

"This pistol? Very good." Ruthann immediately put the pistol in his left hand, then stretched it out. At the same time, he punched Meane in the head with his right fist. Meane couldn't dodge in time, took a punch, and fell onto a chair.

Ruthann shouted loudly, "Sorry, Doctor! Sorry, Doctor!" He hurried to the window. His left hand still tightly held the pistol and fiddled with the door for a while, opened the window, and ran away in a puff of smoke. Bailey was still standing in the corridor, her face as white as paper. (To be continued)
