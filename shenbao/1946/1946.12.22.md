### National Assembly Commences Second Reading of Draft Constitution; Chairman Personally Attends to Explain Several Points; General Assembly to Continue This Afternoon

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 21st] The 26th meeting of the National Assembly Presidium was held at 6:00 PM on the 21st, chaired by Liang Han-tsao. The discussion on transitional measures for the implementation of constitutional governance continued, but no conclusion was reached. It was decided to hold the 27th meeting at 10:00 AM on the 22nd to further discuss the matter. Additionally, the Presidium scheduled a meeting for the morning of the 22nd to determine the presiding officer for the 15th General Assembly session to be held at 3:00 PM that afternoon.

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 21st] The 14th General Assembly session of the National Assembly was held at 3:30 PM on the 21st. Chairman Chu Chia-hua presided, with 1,278 representatives in attendance. Chairman Chiang and his wife were both present, seated among the Kuomintang representatives. After announcing the opening of the session, Chairman Chiang, in his capacity as a representative of the National Assembly Presidium, delivered a report. The Chairman, dressed in a simple yellow military uniform and in high spirits, began after ascending the podium: "Fellow representatives, today the Presidium has appointed me to represent them in explaining several points to you. I am reporting to you today in my capacity as a representative. The first reading of the draft constitution has already passed, and there may still be some who are not satisfied. Therefore, I would like to clarify the following:

(1) The Issue of the National Capital: When drafting, I felt it was unnecessary to include it in the constitution. However, because our constitution's fundamental principles adopted more of the American constitutional approach, it was included. The original draft designated Nanjing as the capital. The First Review Committee's review resulted in a change to Beiping. The National Assembly is a rare and grand occasion, and it is hoped that everyone can be satisfied. Therefore, the point about the national capital can be omitted from the constitution.

(2) Article Five, Concerning Equality of All Ethnic Groups in the Republic of China: Many people advocate adding the Manchu ethnicity. However, the article already states that all ethnic groups are equal, making it unnecessary to add the Manchu separately.

(3) The Additional Article After Article 120, Comprising Two Revised Articles: Regarding the Mongolians, I believe that all Mongolian ethnic groups should have equal status. Regarding Tibet, the clause "The Autonomous System of Tibet Should be Guaranteed"; the word "Autonomous" can be removed.

(4) Article 132: The First Review Committee resolved to add an article to Chapter 12, stipulating that the number of women elected in various elections should constitute at least 20 percent. I believe this stipulation is unnecessary, but special attention should be paid during elections.

Chairman Chiang's report was met with constant applause. After the report, the second reading began. Secretary-General Hong read the entire draft constitution, and the chairman sought opinions on each article. Those without objection were passed. A total of four chapters, from Article One to Article Fifty-three, were passed in their entirety. Among them, Article Seven, concerning the issue of the national capital, was removed in accordance with the Chairman's explanation, with everyone's agreement. Amendment to Article Twenty-eight, originally stating that National Assembly representatives would be re-elected every six years, with each term of National Assembly representatives lasting until the opening day of the next National Assembly. The original article contained a clause stating that "National Assembly representatives may not concurrently hold official positions." This was subsequently deleted by the Joint Committee. Today, the issue was raised again and further amended to read: "Current officials may not be elected as representatives." This was passed by a large majority of 996 votes. The remaining articles were passed as in the first reading.

The following points were discussed somewhat: (1) During the reading of Article Five, Manchu representative Bi Tianmin stood up to speak, intending to explain something. However, because the atmosphere at the time was slightly chaotic, Bi Tianmin's first words after ascending the podium were: "I am a Manchu representative. Please listen carefully to what I have to say about Article Five." His words were imprudent and caused an uproar. Cries of "Get down! Get down!" and boos were incessant. People questioned why they needed to "listen carefully." At the time, Representative Bi still wanted to express his opinion, but Chen Cheng stepped forward to console him twice before he reluctantly stepped down. Afterwards, according to Chen, Representative Bi is a learned scholar who studied hygiene in America for many years but still has a health problem, which is why his words were imprudent. Furthermore, Pu Yi also stated that all Manchu representatives were following Chairman Chiang's instructions and had no ethnic bias. However, the atmosphere was temporarily chaotic. After Bi Tianmin stepped down, Kong Geng also consoled him with a harsh expression. (2) Article Nine had two proposals from Zhang Shizhao and others, which were briefly discussed. The original amendment was still passed. (3) Shi Shangkuan had a proposal for Article Thirty-eight, believing that "President of the Executive Yuan" should be changed to "President of the Relationship Yuan." It was decided that Wang Shijie would explain the meaning and importance of the countersigning power. When put to a vote, Shi's proposal was rejected by a small margin, and the original draft was passed. (4) Article Forty-one originally stated that the president had the power of amnesty, but the amendment did not. Today's meeting saw someone propose that the original draft be followed. After a vote, the amendment was still passed, and the president does not have the power of amnesty. The General Assembly adjourned at 6:00 PM. Secretary-General Hong announced that there would be no General Assembly on the morning of the 22nd, and the 15th General Assembly would be held at 3:00 PM in the afternoon to continue the second reading.

### Article One of the General Principles of the Draft Constitution Sent Directly to the Second Reading

Except for Article Seven, the General Assembly Completes the First Reading

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 21st] The 13th General Assembly session of the National Assembly was held at 10:40 AM on the 21st, with 1,345 representatives, including Chiang Chung-cheng, in attendance. Chairman Hu Shih led the opening ceremony as usual and reported that Wang Bingqian, a representative from the Liaoning region, had passed away due to cerebral hemorrhage at 3:00 AM this morning. The entire assembly stood up to observe a moment of silence. Afterwards, the rapporteur read the minutes of the 12th meeting, and Secretary-General Hong continued with the Presidium's report on three matters: (1) The session period was extended by two days. (2) The interpretation of the legal quorum. (3) The "Procedural Matters" for handling the review results of the various review committees (see separate article). After Chairman Hu explained, he sought opinions on the first and third points. The assembly immediately applauded and accepted them and decided that Sunday, the 22nd, would still be a full day of meetings as usual. Chairman Hu stated that the 60 representatives who requested to speak on the 20th mostly raised opinions on Articles One and Seven of the draft constitution. However, Article One, in accordance with Article One of the "Procedural Matters," where the Review Committee decided to maintain the original draft, was sent directly to the second reading without further discussion. Article Seven would also not be discussed today, and the first reading would continue to be completed. Liu Zhiping, a representative from Hunan's labor sector, stood up and demanded that Article Seven be put up for discussion. Chairman Hu replied that the article was still undergoing negotiations and would be submitted for second reading when the results were available. Subsequently, Chen Cheng added a report on five points regarding the work of the Joint Review Committee: (1) The issue of the number of votes required for the Legislative Yuan to exercise its power of reconsideration in Article Fifty-eight of the draft constitution. The Third Review Committee's review result was "two-thirds of the 'entire' Legislative Yuan members," while the Joint Review Committee revised it to "two-thirds of the 'attending' Legislative Yuan members." (2) The issue of the percentage of women elected. The First Review Committee resolved to add an article to the Twelfth Army: "Various elections should stipulate that the number of women elected should constitute at least 20 percent, and the measures shall be determined by law." The Joint Review Committee deleted the eight words "at least 20 percent." (3) The issue of the local autonomy system of minority nationalities. The Joint Review Committee, based on the Eighth Review Committee's opinion, separated and added two articles: "The local autonomy system of the Mongolian leagues and banners shall be determined by law," and "The local autonomy system of Tibet shall be guaranteed." (4) The issue of the election of National Assembly representatives from indigenous peoples in Chapter Twelve. The Joint Review Committee, based on the principles determined by the First Review Committee, added an article to Chapter Twelve: "The number and election methods of National Assembly representatives from indigenous peoples with special living habits in the mainland shall be determined by law." (5) Regarding the promotion of the interests of border nationalities, the Joint Review Committee, based on the decisions of the Second and Eighth Review Committees, adopted the clauses resolved by the Eighth Review Committee and added two articles to the Thirteenth Army's Basic National Policy: "The state shall provide legal protection to the status of various ethnic groups in border areas and provide special support for local autonomy." "The state shall actively promote and support the development of education, culture, transportation, water conservancy, health, and other economic and social undertakings for various ethnic groups in border areas. The use of land shall be protected and developed according to the climate, soil properties, and people's living habits."

At 10:05 AM, Chen finished his speech, and the reading of the constitution began. Secretary-General Hong read each word and clause in an extremely clear voice. Chairman Hu, in accordance with the "Procedural Matters," sought the assembly's consent to handle each clause, either deciding to submit the original text to the second reading, or deciding to submit the opinion of the original × Review Committee to the second reading, or deciding to submit the opinion of the Joint Review Committee to the second reading. Proceeding to Article Seven, the First Review Committee's reviewed and revised text, "The capital of the Republic of China is set in Beiping," had just been read out by Secretary-General Hong when a storm of applause immediately erupted and continued for three minutes. After the applause subsided, Chairman Hu suggested that the original text of the draft constitution and the reviewed and revised text be submitted to the second reading for discussion. Liu Zhiping once again stood up to object, asking Hu to pay attention to and respect the majority opinion of the First Review Committee. Hu replied that the Joint Review Committee had not yet made a decision on the principle change in this article, and asked to wait until the second reading for further discussion. If there were any revised opinions, he also asked them to be submitted to the secretariat for submission to the Presidium in accordance with Article Twenty-four of the Rules of Procedure. Secretary-General Hong then continued to read the following articles. Except for Article Thirty-one, which was deleted and not discussed in accordance with the Second Review Committee's opinion because it had become ineffective after the above related articles were revised, the remaining articles were read smoothly and submitted to the second reading in the order of the Joint Review Committee's revised opinion, the original × Review Committee's revised opinion, and the original text. There was a recess from 10:45 AM to 11:05 AM, and it was extended again at 11:56 AM and 12:15 PM, and the reading was completed at 12:25 PM. Chairman Hu stated that the first reading of the draft constitution had been completed in its entirety. Several proposals regarding transitional clauses had been submitted by the secretariat to the Presidium, and they would be submitted to the General Assembly for report and discussion as soon as they were organized. Secretary-General Hong announced that the meeting would continue at 3:00 PM in the afternoon and adjourned at 12:30 PM.

### Shanghai Private Newspaper Delegation Asks for Low-Interest Loans in Nanjing; Chiang Menglin and Xu Baiyuan Agree to Assist

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] After arriving in Nanjing to request low-interest loans, the delegation of twelve private newspapers from Shanghai engaged in a full day of activities on the 21st. According to delegation spokesman Zhang Cangping, the delegation visited Premier Song at the Executive Yuan in the morning. However, Song and Secretary-General Chiang were both attending the National Assembly, so Secretary Li Xunhe received them and promised to forward their request to the Premier. The delegation then visited Secretary-General Xu Baiyuan of the Four Joint Offices. Xu expressed great concern for the difficulties faced by the newspapers and promised to submit the request to the board of directors of the Four Joint Offices immediately upon receiving the official document from the Central Propaganda Department and would do his best to help. At around 5:00 PM in the afternoon, the representatives visited Secretary-General Chiang Menglin of the Executive Yuan again. Chiang promised to immediately forward the newspapers' petition to the Central Enterprise Department and request the Four Joint Offices to handle it expeditiously. Chiang also said, "Please rest assured, as long as one newspaper receives a loan, all newspapers will have no problem. The request for loans from various evening newspapers in Shanghai a few days ago has also been forwarded to the Central Propaganda Department for handling." The delegation is scheduled to visit Minister Peng and various relevant parties on the 22nd.

### Presidium Asks General Assembly to Approve Constitution Discussion Procedures

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 21st] During the 13th meeting of the National Assembly, the Presidium reported on three matters, with the original text as follows:

(1) The General Assembly session period was previously decided to be extended to December 21st, which is about to expire. It has been decided to extend it for another two days.

(2) Regarding the motion by Representative Mu Zhendong and others on how to calculate the "more than half" and "more than two-thirds" figures in Article Twelve of the National Assembly Organization Law, a letter was sent to the National Government to forward it to the Judicial Yuan's Unified Interpretation of Laws Committee for resolution. The calculation of the number of "more than half" and "two-thirds" of the attending representatives referred to in Article Twelve of the National Assembly Organization Law is based on the number that should be elected for representatives elected by election methods, and on the number announced by the National Government for representatives selected by the National Government. Furthermore, the latter half of Article Twelve of the National Assembly Organization Law, regarding the number of representatives attending and agreeing when passing a constitution, was also submitted to the 20th meeting of the Presidium for serious discussion. The first reading of the draft constitution has seen widespread expression of opinions, and the Review Committee has reviewed it, but the stage of deciding to pass the constitution has not yet been reached. According to Article Thirty-six of the Rules of Procedure, "The clauses and wording revised and resolved in the second reading may be submitted by the Presidium to the original Review Committee or designated representatives for collation." It cannot be considered as the passage specified in the latter half of Article Twelve of the Organization Law. The meaning of the common articles is clear. If the two-thirds attendance and three-quarters agreement provisions in the latter half of Article Twelve of the Organization Law are applied during the second reading, then the constitution would have already been passed after the clauses were resolved in the second reading. Why would there be a third reading stage? This further confirms that the passage of the constitution is in the third reading. In other words, when passing the entire constitution in the third reading, there must be an attendance of more than two-thirds and the agreement of three-quarters of the attending representatives. This should be recorded and reported.

(3) The draft constitution of the Republic of China has been reviewed separately by various review committees. Those that needed to be reviewed by the Joint Review Committee have also been discussed and decided by the Joint Review Committee and reported to the General Assembly. In accordance with Article Thirty-four of the Rules of Procedure, after the review committee explains the review process and results for the motions that have been reviewed, the general discussion and resolution: either open the second reading, or submit for review again. In order to make the meeting proceed

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 21st] Wang Bingqian, a National Assembly representative from Liaoning, passed away this morning at 3:00 AM due to cerebral hemorrhage. Wang was 61 years old. He had been traveling around tirelessly during the National Assembly session. He recently suffered from a cough but still participated in meetings while ill. After returning to his private residence at No. 38 Jiangjun Lane after the evening meeting on the 20th and talking with friends, he went to bed. At this time, the cough worsened, and breathing became urgent. An urgent telegram was sent to the National Assembly Secretariat to send a doctor to see him, who diagnosed cerebral hemorrhage. Resuscitation was ineffective, and he passed away at 3:00 AM in the morning. Wang was from Jinxi, Liaoning. He followed the Premier in participating in the revolution early on.

Everyone in his position mourns his passing. His remains were moved to the Chinese Funeral Home this morning for encoffining. His wife and nephew were by his side. His son, Wang Qiming, is currently studying at the Dihua Military Branch School. This morning, when the 13th National Assembly session opened, Chairman Hu Shih announced the news of Wang's death, and the entire assembly stood to observe a minute of silence.

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 21st] The encoffining of the remains of National Assembly Representative Wang Bingqian is scheduled to be held at 2:00 PM on the 22nd at the Chinese Funeral Home. All representatives will attend the memorial service. For convenience, the Presidium has decided on the following procedures:

(1) Those where the various review committees decided to maintain the original draft will not be discussed further and will be sent directly to the second reading.

(2) Amendments where the Joint Review Committee's and the various review committees' opinions are the same will be submitted to the second reading.

(3) Amendments where the Joint Review Committee's and the various review committees' opinions differ will be discussed and decided by the General Assembly: either submitted to the second reading or submitted to the Joint Review Committee for review again.

(4) If there are revised opinions on the reports of the original review committee and the Joint Review Committee, they should be handled in accordance with the provisions of Article Twenty-four of the Rules of Procedure.

(Note) Article Twenty-four of the Rules of Procedure of the National Assembly: "Those who propose amendments to the results of the various review committees of the draft constitution should prepare specific items and attach reasons, and must have the joint signature of 30 or more representatives. They should be sent to the Presidium and submitted to the Secretary-General for printing and sending to all representatives before the second reading."

### Ambassador Stuart Arrives in Beiping by Air; He and Marshal Ma Continue to Strive for Peace; People's Socialist Party Pays Attention to Truman's Statement

[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 21st] Ambassador Stuart arrived in Beiping by air at 12:38 PM on the 21st. His personal advisor Chuan Jingbo, Lu Zhiwei, chairman of the Yanjing University Affairs Council, and Cai Yihai, director of general affairs, came with him. General Gillen, American Consul Meishi, and Jie Jiemin all went to the airport to welcome him. After Stuart got off the plane, he was surrounded by reporters at both the airport and Yanjing University. Stuart said that there was no progress in the current situation, and there was no decision on the government sending personnel to Yan'an. He and Marshal Ma had no intention of going to Yan'an recently. The ambassador refused to offer any explanation or criticism of Truman's statement. When asked if there was no hope for China's peaceful future, he replied: Only the Chinese people themselves can decide their common destiny. However, the ambassador also stated that he and Marshal Ma are still willing to not let go of every possible opportunity to engage in peaceful efforts. He said: It is hoped that the National Assembly will pass a more democratic constitution than the May Fifth Draft. This will be a beneficial move for the future of peace and implied that the situation may take a turn for the better as a result. When a reporter asked whether he would meet with Ye Jianying when he came to Beiping, he replied: There is no need for this. The ambassador is scheduled to spend Christmas in Beiping and then go to Tianjin to inspect overseas Chinese affairs and commerce.

[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 21st] Well-informed sources say: (1) The government will send personnel to Yan'an after the government is reorganized. The reorganized government will still reserve places for the CCP. (2) Truman's statement is internal in nature. Marshal Ma and Gillen also participated in drafting part of it beforehand.

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 21st] Xu Chuanlin, the Minister of Propaganda of the People's Socialist Party, recently made the following statement regarding President Truman's statement on China policy. President Truman's statement on China policy is not significantly different from what he stated in his previous resolution. However, today, as we are making a constitution, we feel that its meaning is not ordinary and deserves our special attention. Most importantly, President Truman repeatedly stated "respect for China's sovereignty and non-interference in China's internal affairs." We sincerely accept this statement and extend our gratitude. President Truman hopes that we will form a government that unites the country. However, a legitimate democratic government has not yet been concretely formed. In other words, the so-called democratic politics, as practiced by countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States, is what Truman expects us to strive to achieve. In fact, there is still some distance. Regarding this point of view, our hopes are absolutely the same as those of President Truman. We hope that in the near future, a legitimate democratic government will include all parties and factions to jointly create a democratic and political China. If this can be achieved, not only will President Truman's declaration on China come to an ideal and factual conclusion, but we also believe that world peace will be laid on a solid foundation due to China's internal peace and prosperity.

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 21st] A reporter recently visited Zhang Qun and asked him to express his opinion on President Truman's statement. According to him: Based on what I saw in the United States over the past year and what I understand about President Truman's statement this time, I deeply feel that the United States' China policy has never changed. In particular, this statement is more systematic and practical, and all misunderstandings can be clarified. Zhang also told him that after the National Assembly closes, he will go back and take care of everything.

### President Encourages National Assembly Representatives to Contribute Opinions on the Draft Constitution

During the banquet, President Chiang delivered a speech, stating: "The participation of various parties in the National Assembly's opening is a sign of harmonious cooperation. I hope for even more satisfactory results, new progress, and new developments in the future. I also hope that all representatives will contribute valuable insights to the Constitution." In his response, Li Daming stated: "Currently, many people in China are focusing on economic issues. In reality, constitutional issues are even more important than economic ones. If the Constitution can be successfully completed, politics will be on the right track, and economic problems can also be resolved as a result. Listening to President Chiang's speech, I deeply understand his sincerity in completing the Constitution. The future of China's Constitution is certainly bright. However, we not only hope that the Constitution can be passed but also implemented in accordance with it, so that China can embark on the path of glory and build a new China."

### General Review Committee Concludes

(Continued)

(4) The proposal to add clauses on the division of provinces and regions was passed without objection.

(5) The revision of the chapter on elections to the chapter on the initiative, referendum, recall, and election, and the addition of new clauses: the opinion of the organizing committee was to approve the modification of the chapter name according to the revised opinion, and the whole body also passed it without objection. However, regarding the added clauses, Chen Shaoxian said: "I agree in principle, but the wording should be submitted to the organizing committee." Jiang Yiping said: "There are already provisions in Article 27, so if more are added, there will inevitably be conflicts and should be submitted for reference." Ren Zhuoxuan said: "This is a legal loophole because there are only provisions for the method of election, and nothing else is mentioned. Can the people only use the right to vote? Therefore, adding the initiative, referendum, and recall can further implement democracy. I agree in principle." The organizing committee voted and decided to add the clauses, which were unanimously approved. Subsequently, Lei Zhen reported again on the First Review Committee's review of the election of professional representatives and female representatives. At the time, a Hui representative stated: "The number of people with different lifestyles should be stipulated." Wang Xiaoying explained that there should be textual modifications, which did not need to be submitted to the General Assembly for discussion, and that the latter part of the clause on the Legislative Yuan could be canceled, but the quota of 20% should be retained. Liu Baimin said: "The elections and recalls all refer to the central government but neglect the provincial and county levels, which should be noted." It was then decided to refer the Hui issue, etc., to the conveners of the first group and the organizing committee for consultation and decision.

(6) The chapter division of the fundamental national policy was passed by a relatively large majority. Liu Zongping again requested attention to the arrangement of border issues when dividing the chapters. Hu Shi and more than 30 others provided opinions, namely to explain the cancellation of the amendment opinion on Article 137 regarding the United Nations Charter. Hu said: "This case was proposed by some people who care about world peace. The provisions of this article can also be said to set a precedent in the world, but if it is stipulated and then canceled, it may cause misunderstandings from the outside world. Therefore, you can add the words 'and the United Nations Charter' under the revised bill to respect the treaty, which will not harm the national constitution and will have a good impact on the world," which was immediately passed.

(7) Adding a clause on marriage caused a burst of laughter in the hall. Some people thought it was unnecessary to discuss it, some thought it was a joke, and some said it was unnecessary to be embarrassing. Lei Zhen also reported that the organizing committee believed that it was beyond the scope of the constitution, and the whole body immediately believed that it was unnecessary to discuss it.

(8) Regarding students' separation from parties, Lei said: "The regulations for students are too broad. It is not clear whether they refer to middle school students, college students, or researchers." Leng Xin said: "The Constitution stipulates that people have freedom of belief, so it was decided not to include it."

(9) Passed according to the original plan.

(10) The interpretation of the Constitution does not happen very often, so there is no need to set up another institution, maintain the original plan, and pass it.

(11) Maintain the original plan.

(12) Passed according to the opinion of the organizing committee. After garbage and two limited items were submitted to the organizing committee.

### The Franco-Vietnamese War is Escalating; President of the Viet Minh Government Flees; French Forces Control Hanoi and Declare Martial Law

[Reuters, Paris, 20th] Saigon reports: the war in Hanoi is expanding, and the Viet Minh autonomous government has withdrawn from the area.

[Associated Press, Hanoi, 21st] French and Vietnamese troops continued to fight today on the edge of the Annamese residential area of Hanoi. Part of the district has caught fire, but the European residential area remains under French control. According to reliable sources: Ho Chi Minh, the president of the Viet Minh Republic, and the Minister of War and other members of the delegation, all fled Hanoi on the 19th of this month after the French Commissioner for Tonkin, Sainteny, was injured at the French military headquarters in Tokyo. English military leader Edward has taken control of the government, immediately declaring martial law and enforcing restrictions. People are not allowed to carry weapons without special permission.

[Associated Press, Paris, 21st] According to Vietnamese sources: this morning, French troops stormed the Presidential Palace and hoisted the French flag over the residence and the Vietnamese Parliament. French troops used small-scale attacks to eliminate resistance, and gunfire continued throughout the day.

[Associated Press, Hanoi, 21st] The French military commander in Tokyo, Morey, issued a declaration tonight stating: "The Viet Minh army's launch of this war is the same as the Japanese invasion in March 1945. The leaders of the Viet Minh Republic government have fled, and the French authorities must restore order." The Viet Minh army began its attack at 10 p.m. on the 19th of this month. At that time, the lights in the city suddenly went out. There were many French soldiers on the street, who were returning from the movies on their way to the barracks. Suddenly, gunfire broke out everywhere, making it difficult to distinguish between grenade explosions and rifle fire. Trucks and armored vehicles were constantly traveling on the streets. After fierce fighting, French troops occupied the municipal theater and the water and electricity companies the next day. The Presidential Palace of the Viet Minh Republic was also occupied. The Viet Minh army is still using artillery to bombard Hanoi.

[Agence France-Presse, Hanoi, 21st] French and Vietnamese troops are still fighting fiercely in Hanoi, with both sides using machine guns and heavy ground.

[Reuters, Paris, 21st] Recent reports from Vietnam say: French troops and Vietnamese troops fought fiercely in Hanoi all day, and French troops dispatched tanks to fight. Fu Zhizhong has asked the French government to resume negotiations to avoid massacres. Other reports say: Viet Minh troops have also attacked towns north of Hanoi. The port of Wenya, 150 miles south of Hanoi, has also been cut off from external communications.

[Associated Press, Paris, 20th] All sectors of France today received reports from Vietnam saying: There is a large fire in Hanoi, but the number of casualties is unknown. French officials in Hanoi strongly stated that the Viet Minh army attacked the city from the suburbs with artillery, similar to the Japanese attack on March 9 last year. There were also Japanese in the Viet Minh army. A report from Nanjing also stated: Two leaders of the Viet Minh Kuomintang asked the United States and China to mediate the war. The French political situation is unstable, a formal government has not yet been established, and the Communist Party has openly expressed sympathy for the Viet Minh, making the situation even more complicated.

### French Prime Minister and Minister of Colonies Claim that the Situation in Vietnam Has Not Deteriorated; D'Argenlieu Has Flown to Tunis

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 21st] Prime Minister Blum made a brief statement in the National Assembly last night, saying that the injury of French Commissioner for Tonkin, Sainteny, was not as bad as initially reported. At 4 p.m. today, the French military commander in Haiphong had not received any news from the Hanoi army, which made people think that the outside world had exaggerated the local situation too much. Blum also told the parliamentary delegation of the Socialist Party this morning: "Since last night, we have not received new news from Vietnam, and the general staff has not received fresh reports. Due to the lack of news, it proves that the situation in Hanoi has not changed."

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 20th] The French National Assembly met today, and the Minister of Overseas Colonies, Moutet, made a brief report on the situation in Vietnam. He briefly stated: "The situation in Vietnam is not as serious as reported. We are sincerely committed to peace, but we do not intend to yield to any acts of violence. The government is prepared to explain all aspects of the situation in Vietnam, but this requires the government to send personnel to Vietnam for inspection. Any political agreement can only be implemented if both parties faithfully abide by it. France will never abandon its people and any friends who may be sacrificed by violence. The policy adopted by the French government is to insist on its interests and gain respect. We will do everything we can to achieve this goal through reconciliation." At this point, the Speaker of the National Assembly proposed a resolution of sympathy for the French army in Vietnam, which was unanimously passed.

[Reuters, Paris, 20th] French High Commissioner to Vietnam D'Argenlieu has departed to return to West Africa to personally handle the matter. The plane he was on landed in Tunisia today.

On the eve of his departure, Pei personally went to the capital to visit President Soong for instructions.

### China Has Submitted to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration a List of the Most Needed Items; Interview with Li Zhuomin, Deputy Director of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration

[Our Newspaper] Li Zhuomin, Deputy Director of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, returned to Shanghai after attending the 6th Congress of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration in the United States. A reporter interviewed Li yesterday, and he reported that although the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has decided to end relief to China by the end of June next year, and the transportation work will also end quietly by the end of September next year, it is feared that the work will not be completed in time, which will affect relief to China. Therefore, the Chinese representatives proposed a supplementary teaching method at the meeting in Washington and urged the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to strengthen its transportation capacity to China. The goods ordered by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration for China in various factories are also expected to be delivered as soon as possible to facilitate transportation. The Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has also decided to review the progress of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's relief to China in February and March next year. If the goods ordered at that time cannot be mostly delivered, the funds for these goods will be used to purchase ready-made grain for early transportation to China. A list of the most urgently needed relief items in China has been drawn up so that grain, fertilizer, etc. can be purchased locally immediately when necessary and transported to China. The United States has made the greatest contribution to the relief work this time, with the relief materials supplied by the United States accounting for 70% of the total, especially industrial and agricultural equipment. Canada has expressed great sympathy for China and has been approved by the General Assembly to join the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's Far East Committee, which the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration welcomes very much. Regarding the supply of materials to the Chinese Communist Party area, Li said that the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration distributes materials based on the principle of fairness. Recently, it has been personally approved by President Chiang to allocate a large sum of money to the Yellow River Pan-Communist Party area to relieve 200,000 residents in the old course of the Yellow River in the area. This sum of money can be said to be a rare large amount, which shows that the Chinese Communist Party has broken some facilities on its own, and it is not that the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration distributes them unfairly. Finally, when talking about the new director-general of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, General Rooks, Li deeply appreciated his person and said: "He knows China very well and has expressed to the General Assembly his willingness to be responsible for the work of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration until it is completed." After returning to China, Deputy Director Li visited President Soong in Beijing the day before yesterday to report on the meeting.

### Current Situation of Guangdong Province's Construction; Wengjiang Hydropower Project to Start Construction Next Spring; All Provincial Highways to Be Completed and Opened to Traffic by a Deadline

[Our Guangzhou Dispatch on the 20th] The reporter visited Guangdong Construction Minister Xie Wenlong and inquired about the current situation of provincial construction. According to him, the Wengjiang Hydropower Project has been resurveyed by a survey team sent from Shanghai for more than two months. It can be measured and completed next spring and construction will start at the same time. The estimated construction cost is US$30 million, which will take two years to complete, and can generate 50,000 horsepower. As for the damaged highways in the province, they must all be opened to traffic before August next year. The central government previously planned to designate 3,600 kilometers of provincial roads as national highways, but 75% of the province's highways are privately owned. If the central government takes them over as national highways, it must guarantee the interests of road merchants, which is to rationally determine the value of privately owned highways and compensate and develop post-war reconstruction funds for each road. The central government has now expressed its acceptance and consideration. The national highways that will be transferred first are the three main lines of Guangzhou-Shaoguan, Guangzhou-Kowloon, and Zhanjiang-Shishan. The construction cost for farmland water conservancy next year will total more than 40 billion yuan. Various water conservancy projects are currently under construction. The Pearl River Water Conservancy Bureau has also sent personnel to Youfu City for surveying and plans to open the city as a third-class commercial port. It has been found that the water in the port is very deep, but the port is accumulated with mud and many minerals, so ships of more than 3,000 tons are currently difficult to enter. The bureau has decided to start construction next year.

### Hunan Provincial Government Drafted Ten-Year Construction Outline

[Our Changsha Dispatch on the 19th] The Hunan Provincial Government has drafted a ten-year construction outline for Hunan and submitted it to the current Provincial Assembly for review. The plan is divided into three parts: (1) the economic sector includes agriculture, transportation, and mining; (2) the political sector aims to complete local autonomy and implement constitutional government; (3) the cultural sector takes the establishment of the Three People's Principles as the central idea as the highest principle and implements Liu education. The entire plan is divided into three phases for completion, with the first phase being four years, and the second and third phases being three years each. After completion, Binhu will be an agricultural area, Zhuzhou will be an industrial area, and Hengshan will be a cultural area. The Provincial Assembly is very interested in this case and will study it in detail.

### First Batch of US Surplus Materials from Mariana Islands to Be Shipped to Shanghai Tomorrow; Shipment Will Take 22 Months to Complete

[Associated Press, Guam, 20th] Hundreds of thousands of tons of US military surplus materials from the Mariana Islands, which were previously ceded to China, will be packed and shipped to China by the Vennell Company, which is contracted to transport them, starting today. Most of these materials are located on Guam, Saipan, and Tinian. The company will handle the shipment in accordance with the contract signed by China and the United States in Nanjing this summer, and will be given a considerable amount of remuneration after completing the shipment within 22 months. The surplus materials in Okinawa will be transported by the Morrison Knudsen Company. According to Kikland, manager of the design department of Vennell Company in Guam, who told a reporter from the Associated Press: "It is planned to ship the first batch of 8,000 tons of surplus materials to Shanghai in January next year. The surplus materials on Guam, Saipan, and Tinian have now been classified by American Army and Navy technicians as relief food and clothing, and the transportation equipment to transport these relief materials from Shanghai to the mainland will be given priority for shipment." According to a spokesman for the US Overseas Surplus Property Disposal Committee in Guam: "The surplus materials do not include military supplies, aircraft, or ship equipment." According to the Nanjing Agreement, only the United States can decide which materials are surplus materials. In addition, the surplus materials purchased by China from the United States are limited to those that have not been sold to other countries or have been negotiated before August 31 of this year. According to Kikland: "The amount purchased by China cannot be accurately known, because the US military supply station and main personnel in Mariana have been demobilized, and the wartime situation was chaotic, so precise statistics could not be completed, but in any case, there must be hundreds of thousands of tons. The Army and Navy have taken good care of the surplus materials, and many of them are still in good condition." The two transportation companies are now mobilizing 116 American technicians, 408 Chinese technicians, and skilled technicians, truck drivers, etc. to start the transportation work on Mariana Island. Several Far East shipping companies will provide ships to carry materials to Shanghai.

### Special Article: The Timing of Currency Reform

— Yu Zengkang

Recently, there have been frequent rumors in the market about currency reform. Although the authorities have repeatedly denied them, they continue to occur, and each time they arise, they cause market turmoil, forcing the people to be deeply concerned. At the same time, scholars have also begun to discuss it. It can be seen that the currency issue has become a serious problem that urgently needs to be solved in the current economy.

The currency system has been devastated by the war and must be restored. However, does the legal tender system have any value to maintain? Does the currency system need to be rebuilt? This is a question worth considering first. First, the inflation of the legal tender to this point has made transactions and accounting inconvenient. Second, prices have risen six or seven thousand times. Even if the price increases stop immediately, the people's feeling of excessively high prices will still be difficult to remove. Therefore, the unhealthy concept of valuing goods over the currency cannot be corrected. If the credibility of the legal tender cannot be restored, how can the distorted economy return to the right track? It will inevitably hinder the post-war economic recovery and reconstruction. Third, China's current position in the international economy has been greatly enhanced. However, a legal tender with such a low value cannot consolidate international credibility and shoulder the arduous mission of regulating international finance, stabilizing international currency, developing world trade, and promoting world prosperity. Based on the above, whether for domestic or foreign needs, the chaotic currency system must be reformed as soon as possible. Therefore, currency reform is, in fact, no longer a question of whether or not to do it, but merely a question of timing.

Currency reform must carefully choose the timing, otherwise it will be in vain and will easily cause unnecessary fluctuations. At a time when people are restless and the economy is chaotic, the timing should be carefully chosen. The so-called timing is when it is possible to quickly restore the currency price, stabilize the currency value, and shorten the period of economic chaos, so that currency reform is most likely to be effective. Scholars have frequently discussed this issue, but their opinions vary, and therefore their proposals are inconsistent.

Many contemporary scholars advocate immediate reform, using currency reform to stabilize the economy. If the goal of stabilizing the economy can be achieved, it is of course desirable. Their reasons are nothing more than the following: First, the legal tender has lost the confidence of the people, and the currency system must be rebuilt as soon as possible in order to restore currency credibility, reduce the circulation speed of currency, and stabilize prices. Second, financial balance can only be achieved under a new currency system with a stable currency value. Third, currency reform must be implemented after the economy is stable, but who knows when that will be? It is better to reorganize immediately so that it can be stabilized and benefit the development of the economy. Fourth, the current market has been deeply disturbed by the legal tender. Rather than prolong the process of disturbance, it is better to use a quick knife to cut through the mess and readjust. Although the above points are not without reason, they are also somewhat specious.

(1) Immediate currency reform has many difficulties in terms of reform techniques. First, prices are still fluctuating. If currency reform is implemented immediately, at what point will the currency value be stabilized? Second, the degree of price increases for various goods varies greatly, and there are also significant differences between regions. What goods and regions will be used as the standard? If Shanghai is used as the standard, the stability of the vast inland areas will be sacrificed. If an average price index is used as the standard, the impact on various industries will be different due to the differences, and it will still be difficult to avoid favoring one over the other. Third, the determination of the exchange rate must consider the trend of trade and the situation of international payments. At a time when foreign economic relations have not yet been soundly established and trade has not yet entered the right track, it is even more difficult to predict. Before technical difficulties can be overcome, the currency value is prescribed. Who knows if it will be beneficial? And who can guarantee its long-term stability?

(2) Even if a reasonable standard can be obtained to restore the balance between exchange rates and prices, it will be even more difficult to maintain the currency value when production is weak and trade is in reverse. Any change in one aspect is enough to break the balance. If it feels inappropriate, it will be almost impossible to adjust. Because: First, if the currency value changes again after currency reform, it will inevitably lose confidence, and the possible adverse phenomena that may arise will inevitably be even worse than today. Would the reform be in vain? Second, if the exchange rate is fixed, it will be subject to the international monetary fund. If it is to be adjusted again, it must be after six months, and the range cannot exceed 10%. Wouldn't it be subject to the pain of sacrificing domestic prices to stabilize foreign prices? In short, currency reform should not be taken lightly before there is confidence in stabilizing prices.

(3) It is impossible to achieve absolute balance in fiscal revenue and expenditure under an unstable currency system. However, if currency reform is immediately implemented at present, and a stable currency value reappears, the financial situation under objective conditions will still be difficult to improve. Because even under active fiscal reorganization, there is still a huge deficit, and this deficit cannot be eliminated by economic allocation. Therefore, it is difficult to believe the saying that currency reform can balance finances. If finance continues to rely on issuance to make up for it, how can the credibility of the currency be consolidated even if the currency system is rebuilt? I am afraid that the immediate reform of the currency system will not only fail to help balance finance, but the new currency system will still be destroyed by the unbalanced finance. Moreover, if fiscal reorganization can be actively promoted, there is still a possibility of approaching balance under the current legal tender system. Why not wait until fiscal reorganization has made considerable achievements before reforming the currency system so that it can be effective?

(4) If you want to rebuild currency credibility and reduce the circulation speed of currency through currency reform, this effect will not be lasting when the reform conditions are not met. When people find that there are unreasonable aspects of the new currency system, disturbances will inevitably start again and still fall into an unimaginable situation. Moreover, people's hearts are extremely restless now, and they have no goodwill towards currency reform, but have a sense of fear. Just look at the market, and when there is a rumor of reform, there will be great fluctuations. In this way, even temporary effectiveness cannot be achieved.

(5) The increase in production must be realized under a stable currency value. However, there are many reasons for the decline in production now. Currency value fluctuations are just one of them. There are other, more difficult factors to solve. Therefore, it is difficult to seriously believe the saying that currency reform can revive the industry. The equilibrium relationship between production and consumption has been broken for a long time, and it cannot be restored overnight. If the equilibrium state cannot be repeated, it will be difficult for prices to stabilize. If prices are not stable, what is the benefit of currency reform?

(6) As for market reorganization, it seems to be a superficial way to achieve it through currency reform. The disruption of the market is intensified by currency value fluctuations, but there are still more problems in its own defects. If the defects exist, even if there is a stable currency value, the market will still be difficult to have peace. Before the war, the market had already been shrouded in a speculative atmosphere, which can be used as proof. Moreover, there are doubts about whether currency credibility can be rebuilt if currency reform is implemented immediately. I am afraid that it will also be difficult to renovate the speculative market.

Based on the above, it is impossible to stabilize the economy through currency reform under the current situation. Not only will currency system reconstruction be in vain, but economic chaos will be intensified. Moreover, although absolute economic stability cannot be achieved under the legal tender system, relative stability is still possible. Judging from recent facts, although prices continue to rise, the amplitude of fluctuations is no longer as severe as in the past under the authorities' austerity policies. If there is a real determination to stabilize prices and a comprehensive and effective countermeasure, we believe that the degree of increase can be further reduced, and any sudden changes in prices can be avoided. When the rising trend of prices weakens, speculative activities will be drastically reduced, and the wind of hoarding can also be greatly reduced. Both the financial market and the commodity market will gain considerable stability. Moreover, after speculation declines and the rising trend of prices slows down, it will soon decline, and the credit position of the industry will be improved, which will benefit production. According to past experience, relative economic stability and partial resolution of serious problems can be achieved under the legal tender system. As for currency reform, once it is implemented, it must be successful and cannot be reorganized a second time. If it fails, currency reform will not only lose credibility with the people, but will also damage the status of international finance. The possibility of failure is high if it is implemented at present. Why not take cautious measures and implement reform after the economy has achieved considerable stability? Haste makes waste, and there are many disadvantages. The currency issue, which is of great importance to the future of China's economic development, cannot be taken lightly.

Studying world history, there are two ways to reform the currency system: First, reform comes first, and economic stability comes later. Most of the countries that adopt this approach are in a stage where the currency system is about to collapse. The old currency has no need to exist, and it is no longer possible to achieve relative economic stability under the old currency, and the degree of chaos has reached its extreme. It cannot be overcome without rebuilding the currency system. Under this circumstance, the establishment of the new currency system does not need to take into account the value of the old currency, and the exchange rate with the old currency and the new exchange rate can be arbitrarily determined without technical difficulties. After the currency system is rebuilt, efforts are made to reorganize finance and revitalize production, and economic stability can be achieved. Second, currency reform comes after economic stability. This is because although the currency system has been maliciously inflated, it has not yet reached the stage of collapse; and the old currency is still accepted by the people and still has temporary value; although it has reached the stage where reform is necessary, it can still obtain relative stability. There are many technical difficulties in this type of reform, and it is not simple. The current situation of China's legal tender is similar to the latter, so the steps taken in the reform cannot be superficial.

The choice of timing is of great importance to the success of implementation, and it cannot be hastily considered. Based on the above, currency reform must take economic stability as a prerequisite, so the current time is not right. It must wait until the economy has achieved considerable stability before it is the time for reform. Therefore, we must now work hard to stabilize the economy in order to prepare for currency reform. With sufficient preparation, it will be easy to reform the currency system in the future. Haste makes waste, and there are many disadvantages. The currency issue, which is of great importance to the future of China's economic development, cannot be taken lightly.

### Unprecedented Earthquake and Tsunami in Japan: More Severe Than the Great Kanto Earthquake; Three Islands Shaken, Thousands Dead and Injured, Disaster Area Expanding

[Tokyo Report from Gaizosha, 21st] An unprecedented earthquake occurred in the Shikoku Island area of Japan early on the 21st. According to an investigation by the Japanese Kyodo News Agency, the damage situation as of 5:00 p.m. is as follows: The main disaster-stricken prefectures are Wakayama, Mie, Okayama, Aichi, Gifu, Osaka, Kochi, Shiga, Hyogo, Shizuoka, Nara, Oita, Tokushima, Ehime, Hiroshima, Tottori, Shimane, and Kyoto, totaling 18 prefectures.

Other buildings: 381 completely destroyed, 761 partially destroyed. Factories: 21 completely destroyed, 100 partially destroyed. 1,744 houses were washed away, and 1,406 fishing boats were washed away or damaged. In addition, the entire city of Kushimoto in Wakayama Prefecture was flooded. According to the Tokyo Central Meteorological Observatory, the earthquake occurred at 4:19 a.m. on the 21st, with the epicenter located 100 miles southwest of Wakayama, at 135 degrees east longitude and 33 degrees north latitude. The strongest tremors were felt in the southern part of Kinki, the eastern half of Shikoku, and part of Shiga. The area affected by the earthquake was very wide, reaching as far as Kyushu and the northeastern part of Honshu. It is also said that this earthquake was more severe than the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923 (Republic of China Year 12) and is the largest earthquake in Japan.

It is also reported that after the earthquake, the occupation forces dispatched aircraft to investigate signs of a tsunami along the coast of Japan, but have not yet released a report. The damage to occupation forces’ facilities and troops is also under investigation.

[Tokyo Report from United Press, 21st] Reports of deaths, losses, and destruction from this morning's earthquake and tsunami continue to come in from central and northern Honshu, but they are all from Japanese sources and the Japanese are known to exaggerate, so they cannot be easily believed.

[Tokyo Report from Central News Agency, 21st] According to a dispatch from Kyodo News Agency today, as of 2:00 p.m. when the dispatch was sent, the number of known casualties in the Osaka earthquake was around 970, including 422 deaths, 498 injuries, and 40 missing.

[Tokyo Report from Central News Agency, 21st] This earthquake shook the three islands of Japan: Shikoku, Honshu, and Kyushu. This morning's earthquake was not caused by a volcano, but by crustal movement.

[Tokyo Report from Central News Agency, 21st] Allied occupation forces were injured or killed in the earthquake. The British occupation forces were the first to report that one of their soldiers was missing in the earthquake. There was some damage to buildings in the British occupation zone, but the British said the investigation was not yet complete.

[New York Report from Agence France-Presse, 20th] This morning's earthquake in Japan was recorded on seismographs at several universities and observatories in the United States.

### US Atomic Control Plan: Approved in Principle; Appointed Subcommittee to Study Details; Soviet Request for Postponement of Discussion Rejected

[Lake Success Report from United Press, 20th] Today, the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission approved the United States' atomic energy control plan in principle. This is the first vote since discussions on control issues began in June of this year and can be considered a partial victory for US Representative Baruch. Mr. Baruch insisted on a yes-or-no vote on his ambitious plan, but finally complied with Canada's compromise, which stipulated that it be accepted in principle and that a subcommittee be appointed to study it so that the plan's content would be consistent with the disarmament resolution recently passed by the UN General Assembly. The final vote was ten to zero, with Poland abstaining. Soviet Representative Gromyko refused to vote, telling the chairman, "I am not participating in this discussion," but stated that this was not an abstention. The Soviet request to postpone the discussion for a week and the Polish proposal to submit the US proposal directly to the subcommittee without a vote were both rejected.

During the three-hour meeting, Gromyko stated that he had no time to study the US proposal and therefore could not participate in the vote at this time. Gromyko repeatedly requested the committee to grant a week for consideration. Representatives from China and the United Kingdom privately urged Gromyko to agree to the Canadian compromise, but he ignored them.

One of the key points of the US proposal is that penalties for violations of atomic control should not be subject to veto power. This immediately aroused speculation among the representatives as to whether the subcommittee would interpret this sentence as being consistent with the UN General Assembly's disarmament resolution when drafting the report, as the UN resolution only stipulated that investigations of violations should not be subject to veto power. Other key points of the US proposal include: (1) Establishing an international atomic energy control agency; (2) Establishing an international inspection system; (3) Prohibiting the manufacture and use of atomic weapons; (4) Gradually implementing control, with the United States announcing atomic secrets according to the progress of the control phase.

[Paris Report from Agence France-Presse, 21st] Senator McMahon, Chairman of the US Atomic Energy Commission, left here this morning for London on official business.

### All American Youth Should Receive Universal Training; Emphasizing Moral, Intellectual, and Physical Education; President Orders Military Training Committee to Draft Broad Plan

[Washington Report from United Press, 20th] President Truman today ordered the National Military Training Committee to draft a broad plan that, in addition to military training, pays attention to the physical, mental, and moral development of young people, so as to avoid the fate of ancient Rome and other great countries in history, where people become idle and do nothing after becoming wealthy.

The plan proposed by the Department of the Army only stipulates that young people over the age of 18 must receive military training.

### Based on the Experience of World War II; US Reorganizes Combat Units; Actively Engaged in Building "Amphibious Divisions"; Adopting Mechanized Operations in Sea, Land, and Air

[Washington Report from United States Information Service, 20th] General Devers, Commander of the US Army Ground Forces, announced tonight that the United States will reorganize its infantry and armored units based on the experience gained in World War II. After increasing the strength of the infantry by one-fifth, we can increase artillery equipment threefold and increase firepower more than threefold. The purpose of this plan is to build an "amphibious division" that can conduct rapid mechanized operations in the sea, land, and air. During World War II, V2 rockets continued to attack our troops and civilians in Belgium and the United Kingdom until our ground troops penetrated the launch sites, eliminated the Nazi covering forces, and destroyed the sites and rocket arsenals. In future wars, the goals of our ground forces will be the same. The enemy will never stop attacking the American people themselves until our infantry, armored units, and artillery land at enemy airfields and rocket launch bases and destroy them. After this, the strength of each US Army division in combat can be increased from 17,000 to 18,000 men, an increase of 3,000 men over World War II, but to save personnel and equipment, the current number of men per US division is 14,000. As for the new armored divisions, the number of men will be 15,000. Based on the experience of World War II, a battalion of infantry is added to each armored division, in addition to a battalion of heavy tanks and a battalion each of artillery and anti-aircraft guns. In terms of equipment, one of the most important changes is the addition of a transport aircraft capable of carrying 530 personnel. The number of light tanks in the armored division will be reduced, but the number of medium tanks will be increased. In the infantry, each division will add a battalion each of independent tanks and anti-aircraft guns, and add mortars to increase firepower by 50%. The number of men in each infantry squad will be reduced from 12 to 9, and the engineer battalion will add four squads and a bridge-building squad.

### America's Potential Enemy: On the Other Side of the Northeastern Arctic

He also said that the US Army Air Corps' strategic concept for the Arctic region is based on a realistic confidence. The defense of the mainland should include a plan for Arctic air power. Mr. Anderson said that the potential enemy we see today is on the other side of the Arctic. When planning the defense of future wars, we must plan to coordinate strategy with special combat. The proposal by the US Navy to build eight giant airships, each with a gas capacity of 10 million cubic feet, to navigate the North and South Poles for survey work was revealed today in a report to the Legislative Navigation Committee.

[Pretoria, South Africa Report from Reuters, 20th] South African Prime Minister Smuts said at a reception here today that in United Nations organizations, which are equal opportunities for all humanity, the representatives of people of color outnumber white people, so even half of the opinions of white people are not passed. In this world organization representing humanity, people of color account for one-third, so the remaining one-third of white people must rise up. White people are the rulers of the world, and they are still the rulers of the world, but it is difficult to predict how long this ruling position will last.

### Building World Peace on the Basis of Spiritual Morality; Gu Weijun Delivers Revealing Speech at Celebration Banquet for Founder of World YMCA

[New York Report from Central News Agency, 20th] Gu Weijun, the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, emphasized the importance of world peace being built on the foundation of emotion and morality. He believes that without this foundation, even effective international collective security measures cannot prevent war and bloodshed. Ambassador Gu's speech was delivered at a banquet celebrating John Mott, a key figure in the World YMCA and winner of the 1946 Nobel Peace Prize. Mr. Gu highly praised Mr. Mott's recognition that relations between countries and nations should be based on morality and spirituality, and his spirit of dedicating his life to this work. Seven heads of state, including Chairman Chiang, sent letters of congratulation to Mott. Mr. Gu added that in the world we currently live in, power politics still has its influence, and suspicion and prejudice still exist in international relations. Therefore, leaders of public opinion should come forward at this time to promote the importance of building world peace on a spiritual and moral foundation. Dr. Mott's dedication to this noble cause throughout his life proves that he should be the supreme leader of this important cause. He also stated that he himself and his compatriots have been greatly influenced by Mr. Mott, and China should thank him deeply. Two generations of young Chinese men and women recognize Mr. Mott as their teacher of hope and guidance in morality. Mr. Mott is the founder of the World Christian YMCA. He has also made significant contributions to the establishment of the Christian YMCA movement in China. He has just returned from Oslo after receiving the Nobel Peace Prize, so a joint organization of Christian organizations here initiated a banquet to celebrate him.

### On Japan's New Constitution

...Japanese parliamentarians and the cabinet, as well as the confused Emperor, do not want democracy; they are only doing this to appease MacArthur... (American News)

Owen Lattimore, an American expert on Far Eastern affairs, wrote an article on December 4 on Japan's new constitution, the main points of which are as follows: In Japan's new constitution, we cannot find a single idea that originated from Japanese tradition. The main ideas here are all Anglo-American.

It is true that in order to make Japan a constitutional monarchy, it is necessary to absorb a large amount of British thought. However, the British constitutional monarchy, which is used as a blueprint, has no codified law to examine. Britain only has uncodified law, which includes the procedures and precedents that have evolved over a long history. Therefore, the result of this imitation is very interesting.

The preamble to the constitution begins with a strong American tone: "Government is a sacred trust of the people, from whom its authority is derived and by whom its powers are exercised, and whose welfare is its purpose..." However, this provision does not completely abolish the sacred rights of the "Emperor." Although the Emperor's duties are stipulated as "The Emperor shall be the symbol of the State… deriving his position from the will of the people with whom resides sovereign power," he is still allowed to retain the title of "Emperor." The word "Emperor" clearly refers to the "divinely ordained" or "sacred" emperor.

This dual contradiction reminds us of the fact that although the British King's only task is to issue an edict to the newly elected parliament, he is still called the "by the Grace of God" monarch. However, the difference between Britain and Japan is that everyone in Britain knows that this example of simply expressing loyalty is just a ritual, and this royal power in parliament is only a political event. In Japan, however, in order for ordinary people to be able to recognize the difference between the imperial system's ritual and democratic politics, there must first be several successful general elections and the establishment of many procedures.

The Japanese Diet is organized by the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors. The two houses should be the active part of the new constitutional mechanism. They are in many ways more similar to the British House of Lords and the American House of Representatives and Senate. The Japanese House of Representatives is elected every four years, but like in Britain, if the government deems it necessary to hold a new general election, the parliament can be dissolved. Senators serve six-year terms, with half of all senators being re-elected every three years. The Senate remains unchanged when the House of Representatives is dissolved, which is also the case in Britain. Furthermore, the Senate can veto bills that have already been passed by the House of Representatives. However, in Britain, if the House of Commons encounters such a situation, as long as it can form a majority pressure, it can ultimately override the House of Lords and implement the bill.

As for the cabinet, which serves as the administrative body in the Japanese constitution, and the Prime Minister, who serves as the head of the cabinet, they also feel more like the British system than the American system. However, on the other hand, the separation of powers of the legislature, executive, and judiciary is very similar to the American system and not like the British system.

The big question at the moment is, to what extent can this constitution, which is patched together from the East and the West, change the actual political forces in Japanese society?

Naturally, no one in Japan today is deceiving themselves into thinking that when a democratic constitution is being drafted, debated, and finally formulated, the current Japanese parliament, cabinet, and the confused Emperor will cater to the trend and do something. The truth is that they do not want democracy; they are only doing this to appease MacArthur.

Fortunately, there are already many extremely contentious issues in Japan. The debate on these issues is sufficient to promote the necessary and reasonable process for the constitutional draft to include the real political life of the country. Although the current Japanese parliament is full of reactionaries, discussions on issues such as the Emperor's private property cannot be suppressed. In addition, the correct definition of the Supreme Court's independence from the administrative system and the political rights of workers are also lively and major topics.

### Iranian Kurdish Leader Leads Followers to Flee into Iraq; Tudah Party Declares Not to Participate in Elections

[Baghdad Report from Reuters, 20th] The so-called "Commander of the Kurdish Republican Army" of Iran, Tahar, led over a hundred households of his tribe, carrying armored vehicles and weapons, to flee into Iraqi territory and surrender to the Iraqi military police. Farbyar Bashi, Deputy Leader of the Kurdish Democratic Party, and seven other leaders of the tribe, who previously fled into Iraq, have been taken into custody by the Iraqi government. Kurdish chieftain Bassani, who is wanted by the Iraqi authorities, previously mutinied on the Iraqi border and is reported to have fled to the Soviet Union.

[Moscow Report from Reuters, 20th] A reporter from the official Soviet news agency reported that the Iranian People's Party (Tudah Party) issued a declaration in Tehran on December 16, stating that under the current circumstances, the party does not intend to participate in the parliamentary elections, and accused reactionaries of obstructing the free activities of the People's Party and the trade unions.

### World Silver: Large Amounts Flow to America, New York Silver Prices Fall

[United Press, New York, 21st] Large quantities of silver are being shipped from all over the world to the New York market for sale, resulting in a sudden drop in silver prices here. This silver is coming from China, Spain, London, India, and Middle Eastern countries. Part of it was originally owned by the Soviet Union and was later purchased by Middle Eastern countries and India before being shipped here for resale. Mexico and Canada are also continuing to sell silver to the United States, and despite silver prices being higher in other countries than in the United States, silver continues to concentrate here. For example, the current silver price in Bombay is equivalent to 97 US cents, which is 12 cents higher than here. Several months ago, the silver price in India was 1.30 US dollars per ounce. The sale of large quantities of silver in this market by various countries reflects the desire of silver holders in those countries to exchange it for US dollars to purchase American goods.

### Tea Industry Unable to Bear High Interest Rates; Appeals to Government to Purchase Stored Tea. Five Organizations Held Joint General Meeting of Members Yesterday Afternoon; Elected Representatives to Petition the Capital.

[Report from Our Newspaper] The China Tea Industry Association, Shanghai Tea Export Trade Association, Shanghai Tea Firm Commercial Association, Shanghai Tea Commercial Association, and Southeast Tea Region Farm and Factory Joint Association held a joint general meeting of members at the New Life Club at 2:00 PM yesterday to discuss the issue of requesting the government to purchase tea. Tang Jisan served as chairman, and representatives presented the plight of the tea industry, emphasizing the necessity of immediate government purchase.

### Summarizing Opinions

The opinions of the representatives can be summarized as follows: (1) Approximately 200,000 cases of tea (100,000 dan) are stored in Shanghai, with a value of approximately 30 billion national currency, equivalent to 9 million US dollars. However, calculated at the current exchange rate to overseas market prices, it can only be sold for 5 million US dollars. This difference of 4 million US dollars is entirely due to the unreasonable foreign exchange rate regulations. (2) Opinions of export representatives: The reasons for the poor sales of Chinese tea are: Green tea sales have been affected by competition from Japanese tea. Japanese tea sells for only 38 US cents per pound, while Chinese tea needs to sell for 81 US cents per pound. Red tea sales have been affected by the dumping of Indian and Ceylon tea. Indian and Ceylon tea sell for less than 45 US cents per pound overseas, which Chinese tea cannot compete with. The current value of tea stored in Shanghai is approximately 30 billion yuan. After deducting 7 billion yuan of industrial loans, the rest is funded by merchants themselves. If the government cannot purchase it soon, tea merchants will be unable to bear the burden of high-interest loans.

### Southeast Tea Representatives Suggest Two Points

(3) Opinions of Southeast Region Representatives: Currently, prices have increased 10,000 times, but the exchange rate has only increased 1,000 times, resulting in the actual cost of tea per dan reaching 300,000 yuan, while the selling price is only 80,000 yuan. Currently, half of the tea farmers and tea merchants in the Hangzhou area are unemployed. If the government does not take measures, it will affect production in the interior and cause even more people to lose their jobs. Two points are specifically suggested: (A) Quickly purchase the tea that has already been produced, which must be completed before the end of the lunar year at the latest. (B) Next year's loans should be issued earlier so that tea merchants can prepare for re-production. (4) Opinions of Tea Merchant Representatives: Currently, the purchase price of self-made tea is lower than the purchase price of tea loan tea, which is quite unreasonable, because the cost of self-made tea is higher than that of tea loan tea. It is hoped that the government can handle them equally.

### Proposed Interest Rate Reduction; Exemption from Income Tax on Profits

(5) The interest rate on silk industry loans is 1.8%, while the interest rate on tea loans is 6%. Both are export goods, but the treatment is different, which is very unfair. It is proposed to request the government to implement interest rate reductions to show fairness. (6) It is heard that according to the Sino-Soviet barter treaty, our country needs to repay the Soviet Union 1.5 million US dollars worth of tea. It was recently learned that the government plans to pay off the debt in cash instead of tea, which is astonishing upon hearing the news. If the inquiry is confirmed, we will argue based on reason, so please pay with physical goods. (7) Recently, there have been many British and American merchants who have ordered tea from us, but due to exchange rate issues, the quoted price is too low and cannot be concluded, so only government purchases can solve the problem. (8) Please ask the government to consider the difficulties of the tea industry and exempt it from income tax on profits to reduce costs. The representatives spoke for two hours. Finally, Sun Xiaocun made a conclusion, the main points of which were: (1) The tea that has been produced this year is less than 200,000 cases, and the foreign demand exceeds this number. The current difficulties of the tea industry are all caused by unreasonable foreign exchange policies, and the tea merchants themselves are not responsible. (2) The government is now striving to reduce imports and increase exports. Looking at the administrative authorities' plans for cotton self-sufficiency and increasing national tobacco production, these are clear examples. Next year may be the "Year of Exports," and the historic Chinese tea should not be ignored. What we have worked hard for in the past is to maintain the export market of Chinese tea, not just our own business problems. The government should recognize this point and not adopt a bargaining attitude towards the tea industry's demands. (3) Only purchasing can solve the problem, because purchasing can unfreeze the tea merchants' funds and prepare for next year's re-production. At the same time, tea in the hands of tea merchants will increase its burden and increase its cost due to the payment of interest. After the government purchases it, the cost can be fixed.

### Proposal to Form Petition Group Passed

After the speeches, the proposal to organize a petition group was passed by all. According to the principle of including representatives from various regions, Shou Jingwei, Tang Jisan, Sun Xiaocun, Ye Shichang, Han Ruoheng, Fan Hejun, Tao Zhensheng, Chen Shoubo, Zheng Peifeng, Qian Liang and other twenty-one people were elected as petition representatives to go to the capital to personally express their grievances to the relevant agencies, request immediate purchase, and discuss matters such as interest rate reduction and tax exemption. At the same time, a telegram was sent to the Executive Yuan, Ministry of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry of the National Government, requesting the government to consider the future of national tea and export trade, and to allocate 70 billion yuan of national currency as a special fund for the national tea purchase this year, to designate or create appropriate institutions to quickly collect purchases in various tea producing areas according to the cost of various boxed teas.

### Resource Commission Machinery Plant Products Abundant; Bicycles Sell Well on the Beijing-Shanghai Line

The Shanghai Machinery Plant of the Central Machinery Company of the Resource Commission, since the end of last year, has successively established the First Plant on Guangfu Road and the Second Plant on Tangshan Road and started work. The products of the First Plant are three types: diesel engines, textile machines, and machine tools. Diesel engines are divided into water and land types, ranging from 15 horsepower to 115 horsepower. The former is priced at 5.7 million yuan and is specially used for water pumps and rice milling machines. The latter is priced at 34.625 million yuan, and the sales target is mainly the shipping industry. Spinning machines can be used as carding machines. If each spinning mill runs at 10,000 spindles per hour, it only needs about 35 of these machines. Each machine is priced at 500,000 yuan, and there are about 50 units in production. Machine tools are working mothers, divided into lathes, milling machines, and cold-gas taps, specially for machine factory use. The Second Plant manufactures bicycles, with trademarks divided into wrenches and anchors. Wrenches sell for 240,000 yuan and are Japanese style. Anchors are divided into 300,000, 310,000, 320,000, and 350,000 yuan, etc. Both men's and women's styles are available. The raw materials, except for steel wire pipes, are all supplied domestically, such as brakes and tires. The sales of these bicycles are mainly in Beijing and Shanghai, with more than 3,000 units sold. Current orders are not many. If raw materials are reduced in the future, mass production is planned.

### Report and Prosecute High-Interest Usury; Ministry of Finance Telegraphed Reply to the Municipal Council

[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding the rampant high-interest usury in this city, the Municipal Council, after a resolution by the Social Committee, telegraphed to the Executive Yuan to find ways to stop it, and also requested the Ministry of Finance to order the banking industry to clearly stipulate legal interest rates. The Council received a telegraphed reply from the Ministry of Finance yesterday stating: "The Executive Yuan has forwarded your Council's telegram requesting the Ministry to order the banking industry to clearly stipulate legal interest rates to the Ministry. According to Article 2 of the Regulations on the Management of Bank Deposit Interest Rates, "Bank deposit interest rates shall not exceed loan interest rates. The maximum limit of loan interest rates shall be determined daily by the local banking industry association based on financial market conditions, including two types: interbank day lending and loan day lending, and shall be reported to the local central bank for approval and announcement." Therefore, bank loan interest rates must not exceed the limits approved and announced by the local central bank. Regarding banks and money shops lending at black interest rates or establishing extra names and demanding extra amounts beyond the approved interest rates, the Ministry has repeatedly telegraphed the central bank to instruct local authorities to be responsible for inspection, pay attention to reporting at any time, and handle them accordingly. In addition, underground money shops engaging in high-interest usury violate Article 345 of the Criminal Law and should be reported for investigation and prosecution. The Ministry has also telegraphed to the provincial and municipal governments to instruct them to comply, and telegraphed to the Judicial Administration to notify the courts to assist in the matter, which are all on file. In addition to reporting, please note the matter."

### Ninth District Submits Three Suggestions

The District People's Representative Assembly of the Ninth District recently submitted three proposals to the Second General Assembly of the Municipal Council: (1) Please forward a request to the Municipal Government to instruct all agencies in the city to handle official documents as quickly and comprehensively as possible to enhance administrative efficiency. (2) Please forward a request to the Municipal Health Bureau to establish a public hospital in the western suburbs of Shanghai to provide free medical treatment and medicine to the poor. (3) Please immediately establish a small vegetable market in the Changning District of western Shanghai to improve the city's appearance and facilitate traffic.

### Municipal Police Bureau's Household Registration Administration Handled by Autonomous Agencies

The Municipal Government recently received an instruction from the Executive Yuan stating that the city's household registration agencies are handled by the police bureau due to the regulations of the old Household Registration Law Implementation Rules. Therefore, in addition to the establishment of household registration agencies in the municipal and district offices of directly controlled municipalities and provincial municipalities and provincial capitals, the police bureau also has a household registration section to handle household registration affairs, forming a parallel track and inconsistent powers, which has long been misunderstood by all parties, and it is even more inconvenient to guide and supervise household registration work in urban areas. The revised Household Registration Law and its Implementation Rules were promulgated and implemented by the National Government and the Executive Yuan on January 3 and June 21 this year, respectively. According to Article 6 of the revised Household Registration Law and Articles 3 and 5 of the Household Registration Law Implementation Rules, the Municipal Government should establish a household registration section in the Civil Affairs Bureau. Cities without a Civil Affairs Bureau should establish a household registration section in the Municipal Government. Each district of the city should refer to the townships and towns of the county, with the district head concurrently serving as the household registration director, and establish household registration officers, and establish household registration affairs officers according to the bao, etc. After receiving the order, the Municipal Government has issued separate instructions to be strictly complied with.

### Cold Weather and Low Water Levels in the Yangtze River Make Navigation Difficult; Various Companies Increase Surcharge for Shallow Water

[Report from Our Newspaper] The weather is severely cold today, and the Yangtze River water levels are shallow, making navigation difficult. Yesterday, the shipping industry in this city received water level reports from various ports along the Yangtze River: Suzhou and Huzhou 6 feet 1 inch, Jiujiang 12 feet, Hankou 10 feet, Yichang 6 feet 0 inches, Changsha 1 foot, and Chongqing 5 feet 5 inches. Therefore, ships above 2,000 tons can only load half of their capacity. In order to compensate for the above losses, various companies have increased the surcharge for shallow water by 30% (based on the original freight rate) according to custom, starting from Wuhu as the starting point, and the downstream is also limited to Wuhu. Ports such as Nanjing and Zhenjiang are not increased, and it has been implemented since the 18th of this month.

### Holidays Approaching; "Silent Night" Resounds

Wealthy families, both Chinese and foreign, have decorated with lights and colors, preparing to celebrate the holiday. Since the middle of the month, stores in the city have been making winter decorations, and women purchasing gifts are constantly on the road. Speculative merchants sell Christmas trees, pricing them according to the length of the tree, at 10,000 yuan per foot. Even ordinary small trees require 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. In the silence of midnight, the song of "Silent Night" is heard from time to time.

### Houses on Zhabu Road Sold at Auction; Ordered to Vacate Within Three Days; Residents of Enemy Property Panic; Representatives Elected to Petition Separately

Since the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau entrusted the Central Trust Bureau to auction enemy and puppet houses for the second time, most of the residents of various lanes and houses are old tenants. In the midst of the current housing shortage, they are unable to relocate, and bidders are also deeply afraid of causing disputes, so few people inquire. The Central Trust Bureau changed its strategy and first put a small number of houses up for auction, ordering the residents to vacate. A few days ago, the Garrison Headquarters notified residents of No. 421 and No. 425 Zhabu Road, etc., to move out within three days, otherwise it would be enforced, causing panic among all residents living in enemy and puppet houses in the city. Representatives from various lanes were elected and went to the Municipal Government, the Enemy Property Management Bureau, and the Central Trust Bureau yesterday to petition, requesting a stop to the auction and forced relocation. The representatives first went to the Municipal Government at 10:00 AM. Mayor Wu was out on official business, so Secretary-General He met with them. He expressed deep sympathy for the suffering of the residents of various lanes and promised to convey it to Mayor Wu. After the representatives left the Municipal Government, they went to the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau and the Central Trust Bureau to petition. At 5:00 PM in the afternoon, they returned to the Municipal Government to meet Mayor Wu. The Mayor was holding a meeting, so Secretary-General He met with them again. He told the representatives that the petition had been submitted to the Mayor and that the Mayor had sent a letter to the Enemy Property Management Bureau requesting that the original tenants' right to continue leasing the enemy and puppet houses that had already been auctioned be maintained. Regarding the Garrison Headquarters' forced relocation of residents of houses on Zhabu Road, he would convey it to the Mayor for negotiation and would not execute it immediately. The Mayor will do his best to protect the citizens, he said.

### Winter Relief Fundraising; Residents Generously Donate

Total Exceeds 90 Million Yuan

The winter relief donations in this city were recently organized by the Winter Relief Association Fundraising Committee to issue booklets and distribute them to district people's representatives to solicit donations. It is learned that each district has raised a considerable amount, with the total exceeding 90 million yuan.

It is also learned that in addition to radio fundraising and resident donations in various districts, there have been many cases of spontaneous donations. It was also reported that Cao Qingsan and Li Zhengxing picked up a gold ring on the road, and since there was no way to claim it, they exchanged it for 78,600 yuan and donated it to the Winter Relief Committee with a letter. The Committee has replied with a letter of thanks.

### Renovation of Tianmu Road; Railway Bureau Demolishes Houses to Make Way

[Report from Our Newspaper] The area around Tianmu Road near the North Railway Station in this city is congested with vehicles and has heavy traffic. Recently, the road surface has been damaged, and the Municipal Public Works Bureau is implementing renovations, stipulating that it be widened to 35 meters, dividing it into fast and slow lanes to improve traffic. Construction began on the 6th of this month. However, the original width of the road varies. After the new road is widened, buildings such as the two bungalows in front of the North Station of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration, as well as some civilian houses, need to be completely or partially demolished. It is heard that the Railway Bureau has taken the lead in demolishing them, and the road will soon be changed.

### Fuxing Island Suspect Case Interrogated Yesterday; Foreman and Four Others Detained

### China Industrial Cooperative Association Works Tirelessly Amidst Difficulties; Gradually Expanded After the Start of the War of Resistance; Financial Shortages Affect Party Affairs Advancement

[Report from Our Newspaper] The China Industrial Cooperative Association was originally established after the outbreak of the War of Resistance to provide relief to unemployed workers. At that time, factories in Shanghai closed down one after another, and the number of unemployed workers increased daily. Industrial figures in Shanghai, in order to cultivate national strength and support industry, on the one hand, sold or transferred the machines in various factories to the interior, and on the other hand, adopted the method of work-for-relief to organize the Industrial Cooperative Association, so that unemployed workers could obtain reasonable work within a possible range. At that time, the funds were mostly collected from donations from various parties and a portion allocated by the government. After the fall of Beijing and Shanghai, it moved to Hankou with the war and formally established the association, electing Kong Xiangxi as chairman. The board of directors had three standing directors, and the association's affairs were mostly decided by the standing board of directors. Below the board of directors were the executive committee and the international committee, which were responsible for business operations and international loans and donations, etc. Because of insufficient financial resources, British and American aid loans became the main source of funds. After 1938, the association gradually moved and expanded, and offices and cooperatives were widely distributed in various provinces in the interior. At the peak, there were about 2,000 cooperatives, with internal organizations similar to small factories. Under the management of the association, it changed from a passive relief undertaking to an active industrial expansion. Offices were established in various provinces in the interior, such as Sichuan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Henan, Hebei, Shaanxi, Gansu, Hunan, Hubei, Yunnan, Suiyuan, Fujian, Zhejiang, etc., scattered all over the place, reaching a peak for a time. Later, due to the spread of the war and financial shortages, some cooperatives were destroyed by artillery fire, and some were forced to close. The association supported the remaining situation amidst various difficulties, working tirelessly until victory. Only then did the association move back to Shanghai. According to current statistics, there are only about 1,000 cooperatives left in various provinces. Recently, the association was approved by the Executive Yuan to allocate 100,000 yuan as a fund, but it has not yet been issued. At the same time, many provinces in the recovered areas have contacted the association, requesting to set up offices and cooperatives widely, but due to financial constraints, it is impossible to do so. According to the current situation, maintaining the status quo and enriching the internal organization is already the highest goal. Expansion still depends on the clarity of the domestic situation and the abundance of funds. Recently, some people in the association have advocated moving the headquarters to Hankou, but due to transportation and financial reasons, it cannot be decided for the time being.

### Cotton Textile Industry Year-End Bonus; Labor Concessions Made

[Report from Our Newspaper] According to reliable sources, regarding the year-end bonus issue for cotton textile workers, although no agreement has been reached after the efforts of the Social Affairs Bureau, the labor side has conceded to two months' wages, while the original request was for six months' wages. According to relevant sources, because the profits of the cotton textile industry are particularly generous, the year-end bonus may be slightly higher than other industries.

### Warehouse Director Embezzles; Petty Thief Captured First; Turns Around and Exposes Mastermind

The Shanghai Maritime Affairs Management Committee's Investigation and Sanitation Team received a secret report from a mole last Friday, stating that there were frequent cases of theft of warehouse materials in a certain warehouse at the intersection of Baoding Road and Tangshan Road in the Hongkou District. Zheng Zhong, the leader of the team, and Zhong Jie, the director of the sanitation district, convened all the investigation personnel based on the above report, and arranged a nighttime deployment. Yesterday morning, they mobilized patrol officers to go undercover and wait for arrest in the vicinity of the warehouse. Yesterday morning, a petty thief named Ren Tongqing went to the Xingzhong Warehouse at the intersection of Tanggu Road, acting nervously and suspiciously. When he left the warehouse, it was discovered that he was carrying stolen goods such as Lux soap and bar soap, and he was immediately arrested by undercover police officers on guard. After strict interrogation, he confessed to stealing warehouse materials without denial. He claimed that he was instructed by foreman Wang Ali. In order to investigate the truth of the theft case, the investigation team arrested foreman Wang Ali based on the petty thief's confession. The foreman then confessed to the inside story, stating that it was planned by Sun Nainian, the director of the Xingzhong Warehouse, and that he had stolen warehouse materials several times. It was originally a case of a warehouse director embezzling. In addition to the goods deposited by merchants, there were also some relief materials from the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration in the warehouse. The reorganized team then discussed with the Maritime Police Sub-bureau and arrested Sun Nainian, who will be sent to the Municipal Police Headquarters for investigation and transferred to the judicial authorities for legal action.

### Military Police Hit By Truck, Dies Tragically

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday afternoon, a cargo truck of Huaxing Company, No. 36753, driven by driver Zhang Jinsheng, was traveling from the Beipiao Wharf to load goods at the North Station. When it passed the intersection of Zhizaoju Road and Xieqiao Road, a military policeman of the 7th Platoon of the 3rd Battalion of the 23rd Regiment of Military Police, Lu Ruyou, requested a ride. The driver, in a show of goodwill, drove him directly to Laoximen. Before the car had come to a complete stop, Lu jumped out of the car, causing him to lose his balance and fall backward. His upper body was run over by the rear wheel. In addition to having his left shoulder crushed, he also suffered severe head injuries. The nearby police rushed Lu to the hospital for treatment, but it was too late, and he died en route. The driver involved in the accident is still being detained at the Yi District Police Sub-bureau.

### Misconduct by American Soldiers: Reckless Driving

[Report from Our Newspaper] Last night around 6 PM, a massive five-ton truck belonging to the Yangtze Construction Company, located at 146 Bund, number 31956, was parked at the Customs Wharf. The driver, Guo Jingen, 34 years old and a local, was sitting in the vehicle. Suddenly, a drunken US Marine, identified as Kerr Wan Jian, staggered along the Huangpu River bank. As he passed the truck, he climbed into the driver's seat and started the engine without permission. Guo Jingen was unable to stop him and frantically shouted for help. As the truck approached the intersection of Sichuan Road and Jiujiang Road, it was stopped by a red light. A police officer, number 4908, hearing the commotion, rushed to the scene. However, the soldier ignored his commands and continued driving, recklessly weaving through traffic at full speed. The officer, disregarding his own safety, jumped into the vehicle. The truck then headed west on Henan Road, crashing into a tricycle with the number 37780 along the way. The police officer was frantic but still unable to stop the driver. Eventually, the truck turned south from Henan Road onto Guangdong Road, then east towards the Bund, where police officers and the driver finally managed to stop it. The soldier was taken into custody, and the American military authorities were immediately notified to send personnel to the scene to take the soldier back for investigation.

### Temporary Housing Permitted on Both Sides of Xizang Road North, North of Xinjiang Road

[Report from Our Newspaper] The city government had originally planned to widen Xinmin Road East Section and North Xizang Road. However, after careful consideration by the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, it was decided that the section of North Xizang Road north of Xinjiang Road, which is the proposed site for an overpass over the railway, would not be widened to 45 meters as originally planned due to funding issues. The construction of the overpass has been temporarily suspended, and the land for the foundations on both sides of the road will also not be requisitioned for the time being.

### Ba Chuan Bank Fraud Case: Bank Accountant Attempts to Defraud Bank of Large Sum, Forgery of Teller's Seal Leads to Three Arrests

[Report from Our Newspaper] Ding Qiubin, a 31-year-old accountant from Shaoxing at the Ba Chuan Bank, recently resorted to desperate measures. He used a blank check from a Zhengda Shenzhuang account that had been closed, fraudulently writing a check for 8.6 million Legal Tender dollars in an attempt to obtain cash from the Ba Chuan Bank. Ding meticulously planned the scheme, even forging the seals of the bank tellers Li Falin and Li Ganrong, stamping them on the back of the check. He then discussed the cashing plan with his close friend Li Falin the day before, who in turn passed the check to another friend, Lu Miaoqing, to cash at the bank. Li Falin and Li Ganrong discovered the forgery and immediately reported it to the police, who detained Lu. Under questioning, the entire scheme was revealed. The police then dispatched officers to arrest Li Falin and Ding Qiubin, who confessed to the crime. They are currently being held in custody pending interrogation by the District Prosecutor's Office.

### Another Lawsuit Involving Pre-War Silver Dollar Deposits: Judgment Still Orders Repayment at One Thousand Times the Original Amount. Plaintiff Demands Conversion at Silver Prices, Court Rules No Legal Basis.

[Report from Our Newspaper] A lawsuit demanding repayment of pre-war bank deposits based on the price of silver dollars or standard silver was judged by Judge Dong at 2 PM yesterday. The principal ruling stated: the defendant must repay each plaintiff one million dollars. The plaintiffs' other demands are rejected. The reasoning is summarized as follows: The plaintiffs, Shen Haoming, Shen Cuiling, Shen Meiling, Shen Rongling, and others, deposited 200 silver dollars each at the Zhongnan Bank in the years 19 and 20 of the Republic. At the time, they did not anticipate that the value of currency would depreciate so significantly fifteen years later. If only the original principal and interest of 1,000 dollars were repaid, it would be clearly unfair. However, the government has long since abolished silver dollars, so the demand to repay in silver dollars or convert to the market price of standard silver has no legal basis. Therefore, the court, considering the actual circumstances, has ruled that the defendant, Zhongnan Bank, must repay each of the plaintiffs, Shen Haoming, and others, one million dollars each. This case involves an original amount of 1,000 dollars, but the repayment ordered is one million dollars, which is one thousand times the original amount. This is the third case this year in which the District Court has ruled that pre-war deposit debts must be repaid at one thousand times the original amount. The first case was the lawsuit between Chen Jilin and the Four Banks Savings Society, and the second was the racecourse bond case.

### Two Former Henchmen of the Enemy and Puppet Regime Face Off in Court Over Double-Crossing

Cui allegedly accused Wang of murdering the leader of the enemy Japanese military police, Yokota, and Wang was detained at the puppet Security Headquarters for 32 days, where he was subjected to torture. He was released only after the real perpetrator was arrested. Yesterday morning, Cui Zhanggui was tried in the High Court, and Wang Bin’guang was called as a witness. Note that Wang, also known as "Pockmarked A'gen," was previously accused of being a special agent under the command of the rebel Wu Shibao.

### Puppet Division Commander Tian Tiefu Escorted to Zhenjiang Yesterday

[Report from Our Newspaper] Tian Tiefu, 34 years old, from Rugao, who served as the commander of the 34th Division of the puppet army, was escorted to Zhenjiang yesterday. This puppet army was stationed in the Rugao, Dongtai areas of northern Jiangsu and the Huzhou area of Zhejiang, where they abused their power under the guise of the enemy Japanese, committing all sorts of atrocities. Since the victory, Tian had been hiding in Shanghai. After being captured by the Songhu Garrison Command and sent to the High Court for handling, the High Court determined that the suspect was a military personnel and should be tried by a military agency. Therefore, because the Jiangsu Provincial Security Command sent Adjutant Ge Weimin to escort the suspect, the High Court yesterday brought Tian from the Shanghai prison and handed him over to Adjutant Ge. Soldiers immediately handcuffed Tian, who was pale-faced, before driving him away by car. It is said that he was escorted to Zhenjiang on the same day to be dealt with according to military law.

### Gu Ruhang Tried Yesterday, Plaintiff Also Suspected of Treason

[Report from Our Newspaper] Gu Ruhang, the head of the 20th Bao of the first Lianbao in the puppet Putuo district, accused of assisting the enemy and puppet regime and implementing drug policies, was tried in the High Court yesterday morning. Chen Jigeng, who worked at the enemy's Zhenru Radio Station and allegedly stole light bulbs and wires during his time in a puppet position, was detained, fined, and dismissed from his position. Suspecting that Gu Ruhang had reported him, Chen sued Gu at the High Prosecutor's Office. After investigating, the High Prosecutor's Office determined that Chen was also suspected of treason and filed a joint indictment. After a brief hearing yesterday morning, the court adjourned the case for a later hearing.

### Interrogation of Zheng Jun

[Report from Our Newspaper] Zheng Jun, who served as the captain of the security force in the puppet Fengxian County, falsely claimed that the guerrilla force commander Zhu Che had been arrested by the puppet Security Command and sentenced to ten years in prison during the enemy-puppet period. After the victory, the High Court indicted the suspect on charges of treason for serving in a puppet position. During questioning yesterday afternoon, Zheng Jun claimed that he had originally been a platoon leader in the 94th Army and had been captured by the enemy in Yichang before defecting to the puppet regime. When asked about the allegation that he had accepted a bribe of 100,000 dollars from Zhu Che, he claimed that he had only received 200,000 dollars, which he used to buy shoes and socks for the soldiers in preparation for defection. The court ordered him to provide witnesses to prove this before further review. The defendant was returned to custody.

### Mrs. Mueller Retried, Insists Employment Was Not Voluntary

[Report from Our Newspaper] Mrs. Mueller, the only woman among the defendants in the Ohard Bureau case, continued her trial in the US Military Tribunal yesterday morning, insisting that she did not voluntarily work for the Japanese. If her superiors at the time, Volkler and Heische, had informed her that cooperating with the Japanese was dangerous, she would never have worked for the Japanese, as she neither understood Japanese nor was afraid of the Japanese soldiers. At the time, she had inquired with Volkler, but Volkler believed that there was no risk and handled everything on her behalf. As for the nature of the Russian telegrams she translated, they covered a wide range of topics, including material supplies, industrial conditions, social situations, agricultural news, inland navigation, private receptions, and financial transactions.

Mrs. Mueller also stated that she felt apologetic for the many unfavorable statements she made about Volkler and Heische in her testimony.

### Reassessment of Housing Tax and Construction Tax Valuations May Be Requested if There Are Concerns

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Finance Bureau, in response to concerns expressed by citizens regarding the collection of the autumn housing tax and municipal construction tax, issued the following explanation yesterday: The 26-year rental value listed on the current housing tax payment notice is not the actual rent of the house at that time. In the former International Settlement and former French Concession areas, it is based on the valuations of the former Municipal Council and former French Concession Board of Directors. These valuation records are fully preserved in the Finance Bureau, and citizens can consult them at any time if they have questions. In the former International Settlement area, the Municipal Council, recognizing the unevenness in rental prices for self-occupied and rented houses within its jurisdiction and the possibility of underreporting rental values, hired a valuation committee composed of well-known Chinese and foreign architects in the 29th year of the Republic. The committee surveyed and mapped all buildings in the area on a large scale, and based on the land value and construction cost in the 26th year, as well as the actual rent and the use, location, structure, age, decoration, and internal equipment of the houses, compiled a fair valuation rate for the 26th year. The fair rental value of each house was then determined by multiplying the area of each household's house by the fair valuation rate. This valuation process was extremely cautious, and after the valuations were finalized, each household was notified of the valuation amount and used it as the basis for collecting taxes. At the time, citizens did not object. After the Finance Bureau took over last year, it continued to collect taxes on this basis without any changes. As for the fixed rental value in the former French Concession area in the 26th year, it was estimated by the former French Public Works Board. The Bureau has also been taxing based on this valuation. However, its valuation process is not as detailed as that of the former International Settlement. If citizens believe that this valuation is unfair, they can apply to the Finance Bureau for reassessment. New buildings constructed after the 26th year were also valued according to the above method.

### First Snowfall, Clear Weather Expected Today

[Report from Our Newspaper] The city experienced its first snowfall yesterday morning around 5 AM. White flakes fluttered in the wind, seemingly adding a beautiful touch to the upcoming Christmas holiday. However, because the ground temperature was relatively high, the snowflakes melted upon contact and stopped quickly. According to the weather station, the center of the cold front reached northern Hubei yesterday and is continuing to move southeast. The weather in the city is expected to be clear today, but the cold will intensify. Furthermore, another anticyclone center has formed over Mongolia. The city will enter another transition period around Christmas. If the cold front advances quickly, there may be more snowfall at that time.

The Shanghai Weather Station's meteorological report is summarized as follows:

### Shanghai Allotted 500 Million in Allied Victory Bonds

[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding the allocation of the 33rd year Allied Victory Bonds to be raised in the city, the Ministry of Finance had previously approved an amount of 500 million dollars and repeatedly telegraphed the Municipal Government to expedite the fundraising and report by the end of December.

The remaining 100 million dollars will be the responsibility of the various district offices to solicit contributions, which has been divided into six levels of allocation based on the actual situation in each district in consultation with the Civil Affairs Department, with a maximum of 5 million dollars and a minimum of 1 million dollars. Since the Municipal Government is concerned about the economic burden on citizens, it has decided to submit it to the Municipal Council for discussion.

### Beijing-Shanghai Train Post Office Advances Mail Collection Time

Since the post office started operating the train post office and sorting mail according to the delivery branches in Beijing and Shanghai, all mail between Beijing and Shanghai can be delivered to the recipient during the first delivery in the morning of the next day. However, the work of the Beijing-Shanghai train post office is more complex, and senders are requested to send mail to Nanjing early. Except on Sundays and holidays, mail should be sent by 7 PM at the latest every day so that the post office can complete the sorting in time.

According to the Manila Post Office, airmail from Shanghai to the United States via Manila is now transferred to other airlines for transport to the United States because Pan American World Airways flights have been suspended.

### Social Services: Reader Inquiries

Legal Questions

(1) Dissolution of Engagement

Peng Qingyuan asks: Man A and woman B were engaged in the 23rd year of the Republic by their parents. They have not yet married. After the war of resistance, A went west with the army and has not been heard from since. In the 30th year, the parents of both parties agreed to dissolve the engagement. Afterwards, A and B went their separate ways. In the autumn of the 31st year, B married man C as his concubine, but no wedding ceremony was held due to the extraordinary circumstances at the time. This spring, A returned from the rear and demanded that his parents recover his fiancée. Since he did not agree to it, he does not recognize the dissolution of the engagement, but his parents refuse his request and want him to marry someone else. But A still objects. Please advise: (1) Is it effective for his father to dissolve the engagement on his behalf after being away for many years? (2) Is the relationship between C and B established as husband and wife? (3) Does C have the right to prevent A and B from communicating? (4) If A and B have improper conduct or run away together, can C accuse A of enticing a married woman and disrupting the family?

[Answer from Lawyer Mi Xitong] (1) It depends on whether the dissolution of the engagement at that time met the legal requirements and whether A and B were of age. (2) Marital status is established only after a public wedding ceremony. (3) C has no right to prevent it. (4) C cannot sue.

(2) Refusing to Vacate on Pretext

Huang Qingsheng asks: I have a spare house that was rented to the Zou brothers in August of the 31st year of the Republic through the introduction of Mr. Gu. There were no rental procedures at the time, but it was verbally stated that they were temporarily residing there, and only the two brothers were to reside there. However, the Zou brothers moved in their mother, younger brother, and brother's wife without my consent. Several years have passed. Now that my children have grown up and the house is not enough to distribute, I have repeatedly ordered them to vacate, but they always refuse on the pretext of having nowhere to move. In July of this year, the Zou brothers built four large shanties on Tongbei Road, and they sublet the spare house to others. Now they do not live in my house permanently. Please advise: (1) Is it legal to take back the house for my own use? (2) Is it reasonable for the Zou brothers to refuse to vacate my house when they have built their own shanties for self-occupation and have extra space?

[Answer from Lawyer Mi Xitong] (1) If there is concrete proof, you can request a ruling from the competent court. (2) It is unreasonable and inhumane.

### Fu Zhengmo Talks About Conscription: Shanghai Draftees to Enlist in Summer or Autumn Next Year; Integrated Training in Active Duty Units; Provisions for Eligible Women to Serve in the Military Also Exist in Military Service Law

[Report from This Newspaper] Lieutenant General Fu Zhengmo (see photo), Commander of the Shanghai Garrison District, took the night train yesterday to Nanjing on official business and will then proceed to Chongqing. Before his departure, he told a reporter from this newspaper that the location of the district headquarters has not yet been finalized. Although several sites have been surveyed, the troops currently stationed there have no place to move to either, so the matter must be submitted to the Ministry of National Defense for approval. In the future, the headquarters location will ultimately be in the Hongkou or Jiangwan area. Currently, the office is temporarily located in the guest house of the First Supply District Command headquarters at the end of North Sichuan Road.

According to the Military Service Law, eligible draftees are those aged 21 and above. If the number is insufficient, replacements will be made in sequence. The standards for exemption, deferred service, and prohibition from service are all stipulated in the Military Service Law. The qualifications for deferred conscription and deferred recall are handled according to government decrees. The work of investigating household registration and the age of draftees will be assisted by the municipal government. Physical examinations will be conducted by local Shanghai doctors. The standard for qualified Grade A conscripts is a height of 1.61 meters or more and healthy body parts. Those whose height does not meet the standard will serve in the Grade B supplementary service. Examining the physical condition of over 40,000 eligible draftees in the city will take considerable time, so formal drafting and enlistment training will likely occur in the summer or autumn of next year. Commander Fu also stated that the enlisted draftees will be integrated into active duty units for training.

Regarding measures for eligible women to serve in the military, the Shanghai Garrison District currently has no plans to implement them. However, according to the Military Service Law, eligible women may, at their own volition, receive appropriate military auxiliary service education during peacetime and may be conscripted to perform military auxiliary service during wartime.

The Shanghai Garrison District will establish three sections: the first section will handle investigation and training, the second section will handle conscription, and the third section will handle veterans in their hometowns.

Finally, Commander Fu emphasized that the people of this city should understand that conscription is not only a wartime task but should be prepared for during peacetime. To build a nation, we must first build the military; to build the military, we must have military service.

### Rising Tide Sweeps Through the Market: Gold, Paper Money, and Stocks Surge Ahead; Commodities Are Not to Be Outdone; Speculating Capitalists Beaming with Joy; Ordinary Citizens Panic-stricken

Yesterday, news spread that President Bei had gone to Hong Kong, and speculators seized the opportunity to stir up trouble, resulting in an unprecedentedly fierce rising tide. The market opened at 2.41 million with buyers actively bidding. Reports that the exchange rate between foreign currencies and gold to our national currency had not been announced further fueled buying interest. Prices soared immediately after the opening, and the 3.5 million mark was quickly surpassed. As President Bei's trip to Hong Kong triggered more speculative activity, the upward trend intensified. Shortly after 10:00 AM, the Central Bank allocated 200 bars at a price of 3.59 million. Subsequently, the price briefly dropped from 3.62 million to around 3.55 million. There was talk of banning new short selling, but buyers continued to demand, one after another. By noon, the price finally approached the 3.7 million mark, hovering between 3.68 million and 3.7 million at lunchtime, up 280,000 from before the closing. Gold jewelry was quoted as high as 3.9 million. Silver dollars continued to rise, and the hidden interest rates became tighter, with interest rates rising to around 15%.

Foreign currencies also prospered yesterday, with the US dollar opening at 6,500 to 6,700 yuan, gradually climbing higher. By lunchtime, it had risen to over 7,000 yuan. In the afternoon, due to it being Saturday, there was little change, and it remained between 7,000 yuan and 7,200 yuan, up 600 yuan from before the closing. Hong Kong dollars also rose, starting from 1,350 yuan and climbing to 1,500 yuan at the close, resulting in a gain of 120 yuan from the previous close. The Hong Kong exchange rate rose to 1,300 yuan to 1,350 yuan, the Indian exchange rate was 1,580 yuan, and the British exchange rate was 20,800 yuan. Supply was short of demand, and only the Hong Kong exchange rate saw active trading. Sellers, due to the chaotic situation, were hesitant to act.

### Despite Some Selling Pressure, Chinese Stocks Maintain Their Strong Uptrend

Chinese stocks rose again yesterday due to the popularity of gold and paper money. There was some selling pressure, and the high prices seemed somewhat relaxed, but the support from gold prices allowed them to stand firm. The market opened higher and continued to climb with gold prices. Numbers 19, 89, and 224 were actively purchased. Water-powered yarn continued to rise to the 700 yuan mark. Numbers 177, 76, 215, and 232 fell back by over ten yuan due to selling pressure, but shortly after, Numbers 185, 89, 211, 83, and 207 rose to their limit, along with Delivered Meiya and Matches, rising to around 705 yuan. Numbers 232, 88, 152, 180, 22, 177, and 152 were sold, causing a drop to below 685 yuan. However, the gold market was even more popular. Number 83 was bought in. Although Numbers 232 and 76 were offered for sale, various odd-lot funds repeatedly participated, and with the support of the gold market, they rose again. Major players, such as Numbers 145, 22, and 84, aggressively bought Meiya, causing Meiya to repeatedly rise to its limit. Delivered water-powered yarn also rallied several times to 715 yuan.

### Under the Frenzied Rise of Gold and Paper Money, Silk Products Are All Boosted

Yesterday, under the rise of gold and paper money, silk products were also boosted. Artificial silk No. 120 with the Guangxu brand opened at 3.55 million yuan, and by the close of the noon session, it had retreated slightly to 4.6 million yuan, an increase of 780,000 yuan compared to Thursday. Gaoshan was at 4.3 million yuan, and Dongyang was at 5 million yuan. Semi-gloss was also up around 1 million yuan compared to Thursday. No. 30 Snow Pagoda dull, traded at 6.6 million yuan and 6.7 million yuan in the morning. Although there was ample spot supply in the market, quoted prices did not show any signs of weakness, and factory owners were even more aggressive, quoting consistently higher prices. The market was chaotic, and only one or two loads were traded throughout the day, purchased by manufacturers who needed stock and had to bite the bullet. According to industry insiders, the cost of each load of autumn raw silk is over 6 million yuan, so the rise in factory silk prices is within expectations. The high cost of raw materials invigorated the silk fabric market. Duvet covers were quoted at 900,000 yuan, and checkered crepe sold for 9,000 yuan. Brocade was even more popular, selling for 3,750 yuan. Artificial silk feather yarn was slightly less competitive, with high-end products selling for around 6.5 million.

Central Trust Bureau to Distribute Early Japan-Made Artificial Silk

The Central Trust Bureau, acting as an agent for the Government Property Management Committee, approved the 18th distribution of artificial silk. Three weaving tape companies were allocated 5.5 boxes of artificial silk, eleven dyeing and weaving companies were allocated 31 boxes, and seventy-four knitting companies were allocated 56.5 boxes. All of the above were early Japan-made artificial silk, with a price of 2.715 million yuan per box.

### Steam Coal Lumps Rise Sharply

In the coal market, the allocation of steam coal lumps is extremely scarce, and market prices continue to climb in bidding, rising sharply again compared to the previous market. Steam coal scraps are more moderate, also rising by 100,000 to 200,000 yuan. White coal, the Quanhong lumps imported from Hanyang, has already started trading, with each lump selling for 1 million yuan, and transactions at 990,000 yuan were not uncommon. Mixed Hong lumps are still around 900,000 yuan. The Jiao Zuo lumps were voluntarily lowered by sellers by 20,000 yuan to compete. Firewood and charcoal sales continue to be robust, and the market atmosphere is strong.

### Due to a Large Difference from the Reviewed Price, There Are No Formal Transactions in the Rice Market; Oilcakes and Grains Also Rise Across the Board

The rice market saw a total arrival of over 11,000 shi from the north and south. Prices in various producing areas inland were high, gold was skyrocketing, and people were jittery. Prices for northern and southern japonica were quoted 2,340,000 yuan higher, but due to the large difference from the reviewed price, there were no formal transactions in either the northern or southern markets. Only a small amount of central gate southern japonica was traded. There was no market price for high-quality goods. It was precisely during the Winter Solstice, and sales were brisk, continuing to jump 3,400,000 yuan. Indica rice also saw less trading. By noon, people were less enthusiastic. In the oil market, with the arrival of goods from various routes, breathing was less labored, and factories also supplied. Crude oil increased by 2,300,000 yuan, and soybean oil also rose by 2,300,000 yuan. Qingdili, because prices were already low, stores became more interested and rebounded by 3,400,000 yuan. Rapeseed oil also increased by 2,300,000 yuan, and Su oil rose accordingly by 2,000,000 yuan. The sales of flour were quite fragrant, rising again by 1,000 yuan, and bran was also the same, continuing to rise by 1,000 yuan. Soybean cakes, however, saw little change because sales to other ports were normal. The street was bustling with the sale of soybeans, and prices rose by 300 to 1,000 yuan. However, Pinghu Doudou was average, and Nanyang mung beans were still scarce, rising by 1,000 yuan. Red beans were driven by Shantou and Taiwan, jumping by 3,000 yuan. Red sorghum, due to rising liquor prices, was eagerly purchased by distilleries, rising by over 1,000 yuan. Broad beans remained stable. Sesame was still handled by Guangdong traders, and the market was solid. Peanut kernels were strengthened by Guangdong's demand, rising again by 1,200 yuan. Wheat continued to rise by over 1,000 yuan. Cowpeas and pigeon peas continued to be inquired about by Shantou, but there was no supply in the market.

### After the Trade Regulations Were Changed, the Shipment of Film Equipment to China Was Temporarily Postponed

It is learned that a large batch of film equipment that China ordered from the United States, originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai within the year, has been temporarily delayed by the American side after our government revised the provisional regulations for import and export trade. It is said that the shipment will not commence until the import permit is approved and the quota issue is resolved.

Furthermore, film equipment in this city, such as cameras and projectors, are currently lacking, especially film. According to a recent survey, the current inventory can only be maintained for a few months, but there is more negative film than positive film. If multiple copies are to be printed, difficulties will inevitably arise.

### Chemical Industry Struggles to Survive

Of the chemical manufacturing industries in this city, which had over a hundred members before the war, only half remain. Only seven or eight factories can still maintain operations, and the rest are on the verge of collapse. According to industry insiders, many foreign chemical raw materials are currently being imported, making it difficult for domestic products to compete. Furthermore, because the Chinese people believe that chemical raw materials must be purchased from abroad to be reliable, the sales of domestically produced products are even more seriously affected.

### Industrial Association Asks Transportation and Management Committee to Relax the Quota on Industrial Raw Materials; Allows Some Factories to Complete Registration Retroactively

[Report from This Newspaper] The Shanghai branch of the China National Industry Association held a banquet yesterday at around 5:00 PM at its new location on Xiangyang North Road, inviting Chen Changtong, Director of the Secretariat of the Executive Committee of the Transportation and Management Committee, Li Gan, Director of the Quota Allocation Office, and Xu Xianda, Deputy Director of the Foreign Exchange Examination Office of the Central Bank. Wu Yun-chu, Chairman of the Association, Rong Hongyuan (represented by Zhang Mengzhao), Managing Director, Jin Runxiang, Director-General, Zhuang Zhihuan, and Secretary Tian Heqing were all present. During the banquet, the Industrial Association raised two questions, requesting assistance from the committee: (1) When allocating quotas, the industrial raw material category should be based on the recommendations of the industrial sector. (2) The import quota of industrial raw materials should be relaxed and directly allocated to each factory to avoid exploitation by intermediaries. Mr. Li Gan stated that the authorities had already considered the principles raised by the Industrial Association. The government's standpoint is ultimately to consider the interests of the entire industry and commerce and will not profit a few. However, he noted that the circumstances of various industries are different. For example, the cotton spinning industry is relatively simple. Other complex industries will be handled with caution. In short, everything should be done sequentially according to the principles raised. Subsequently, Mr. Chen Changtong stated regarding the first issue raised by the Industrial Association that the Transportation and Management Committee will appoint experts from the industrial and commercial sectors to form a consultative meeting to facilitate consultation and collect diverse opinions.

Mr. Jin Runxiang then raised that the import of industrial raw materials is indeed a problem. For example, the foreign exchange for paper pulp cannot be obtained currently. Mr. Li Gan expressed great sympathy for the difficulty in obtaining industrial raw materials. However, he said that the situation is complex, and the most fundamental solution is: (1) to find ways to increase the production of raw materials, and (2) to save the consumption of raw materials. Other than that, there is no fundamental solution.

Finally, the Industrial Association requested that, although factories have already registered directly with the Transportation and Management Committee in order to obtain import qualifications, there are still some factories that have not completed registration before the deadline. They hoped that the Transportation and Management Committee would allow them to complete registration retroactively. Mr. Chen Changtong agreed to submit the request to the committee for discussion.

### Year-End Socializing Increases, Cigarette Prices Skyrocket

[Report from This Newspaper] Cigarette prices have skyrocketed recently, and the reasons can be found in both supply and demand. On the supply side, after the implementation of the import permit system, foreign cigarettes have become prohibited import items. Merchants who have goods in hand are adopting a wait-and-see attitude. At the same time, the recent rise in gold prices has also stimulated people's desires. On the demand side, the year-end is approaching, socializing has increased sharply, and the needs of both local and out-of-town areas have suddenly increased, so market prices are high. The monthly cigarette production in this city is estimated by industry insiders to be over 20,000 boxes. Among them, the China Tobacco Company, operated by the Ministry of Economy, ships about 8,000 boxes per month. It is said that the labor unrest has had a considerable impact on production. It is now understood that the labor and management have reached an agreement in principle on the company's year-end bonus issue, but the settlement has not yet been signed. Regarding the possibility of foreign companies, such as the British American Tobacco Company, which is a mainstay, establishing factories in China, the reporter also inquired with relevant people yesterday. It is said that this matter is not simple, because the manufacture of new brand cigarettes in China requires approval from the Goods Tax Bureau. It is questionable whether it can be approved under the current circumstances.

### Silk Weaving Industry Plans to Organize a Joint Production and Sales Company

Regarding the establishment of a special committee for the silk weaving industry, after several discussions among the relevant authorities, it will be realized in the near future. This organization is jointly formed by the Central Silk Company, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Central Trust Bureau, to allocate purchased raw silk and artificial silk to various factories for weaving. The first phase is limited to three months. If the results are good, the second phase will continue. This principle has been decided, but the implementation details still need to be submitted to the Economic Management Bureau for approval before being announced and implemented. It is reported that the Silk Weaving Industry Association is planning to organize the Shanghai Silk Weaving Production and Sales Joint Stock Company. According to the person in charge of the industry association, the purpose of the planning is to unify the export agency, and it has been approved by the authorities to allocate raw materials. A contract will be formally signed with the Central Bank in the near future. The association issued a notice yesterday, requiring each member factory to use half of the number of machines currently in operation as the number of shares to subscribe to, with each machine accounting for 200,000 yuan, to be paid in one lump sum. When raw materials are allocated in the future, this amount will be used as the standard. It is stipulated that the subscription must be completed before December 23, otherwise, it will be considered a voluntary waiver.

### Gradual Turnaround in the Yarn Market

Yesterday, the yarn market saw mixed results. 20-count grass-packed goods, a form of allocated product, were still being resold tirelessly. However, merchants from Beijing and Wuhu and other regions absorbed them at low prices, and gold reached a new high, indicating that the yarn market had the potential to stop falling and start rising. However, due to meager actual sales, the situation presented a lack of upward momentum. The trading prices of each count were roughly the same as on the 19th.

### Cotton Yarn Handling Plan Expands from Six Points to Eight Points

[Report from This Newspaper] The Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association convened a temporary membership meeting yesterday at 3:00 PM, attended by approximately 70 to 80 representatives from various member factories of the association, chaired by Mr. Wang Qiyu. During the meeting, the six points of the cotton yarn handling plan proposed by the government were submitted for detailed discussion. Finally, it was decided to expand them to eight points and submit them to Chairman Wu of the Textile Management Committee to be forwarded to President Song for approval. It is said that if approved, it is expected to be implemented from January 1 next year.

Furthermore, a temporary motion was made at the meeting: In order to promptly supply the raw material needs of various factories, the Textile Management Committee should allow cotton import merchants to ship raw cotton to Shanghai and Jilin immediately under the principle of free purchase. A decision was made to inform the Textile Management Committee of this. The meeting adjourned at 4:30 PM.

### Taiwan Sugar is Short and the Market is Tight

Yesterday, the Taiwan Sugar Association was more chaotic due to the lack of spot goods. For example, Medium sand white and raw sand red had a fluctuation of over 10,000 yuan, but since the 28th batch of Medium sand white, etc., opened a few days ago amounted to over 50,000 bags and the 26th could be shipped, it is hoped that the prices could be lowered. Five-goat coarse white opened at 176,000 yuan, and customers came to buy four or five carriages of white at 186,000 yuan. Shantou ingot was loose, opening at 101,500 yuan. Runde blue was around 100,000 to 97,800 yuan, with 400 to 500 bags traded. The blue-red Diao Qing still opened at 110,000 yuan, and the 3rd Jianbing opened at 225,000 yuan.

### Cargo Owners Raise Prices; Tea Transactions are Scarce

Although foreign tea companies had an appetite for the foreign tea market, the bottom stock of Chen Chouzhen and Chen Zhenmei were running low, and the cargo owners raised the prices, resulting in an overall price increase. As for high-end Chen Qi Kai, the British firm Jen Kee & Co. also intended to buy, but there were few suppliers, so the transaction was not formalized. There was no major change in other varieties. As for the domestic sales of red and green tea, the street and customers were sluggish.

According to the tea industry, the black tea produced in India, Ceylon, and Java has been improving in recent years, and from January 1 next year, it is said that Shanghai will unify the management and restore free trade. It is rumored that a British firm in Shanghai has ordered 20 million pounds from Ceylon to ship to various parts of Europe.

### Domestic Remittance Statistics

Recently, the Shanghai branch of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau reported that the amount of remittances from inland to Shanghai in the past two months has been more than that from Shanghai to inland. For example, in October, remittances from inland to Shanghai amounted to over 15 billion yuan, while remittances to inland amounted to only 1.6 billion yuan. In November, remittances from inland to Shanghai amounted to over 25 billion yuan, an increase of 10 billion yuan compared to October, while remittances to inland amounted to only 1.2 billion yuan, a decrease of 400 million yuan compared to October.

### Japanese Goods Revive and Will Be Dumped in Shanghai Again

Since the authorities allowed Japan to resume free trade, Japanese white paper has already arrived in Shanghai for dumping. It is now learned that Japanese cotton yarn, toys, clocks, bicycles, chemical products, etc., have also been approved for export. In addition to expanding to the Nanyang market, they will soon be shipped to China for sale. Some are said to be waiting to come to Shanghai. Amidst the flood of American goods, Japanese goods are coming to compete again, not only threatening our endangered industry and commerce but also a disgrace to our country's victory in the war.

### Municipal Fishery Association Cables Ministry of Education to Establish a Fisheries College

After the victory of the war, more than 20 fishery companies were established by the Shanghai Fishery Association. They purchased fishing vessels to operate fisheries, and more than 30 fishing vessels from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration have arrived in Shanghai. More will be shipped in the future. The future development is limitless, but our country has always lacked talents in fisheries. Now that the industry is just developing, it is already feeling that there are not enough personnel to allocate, and there is no way to recruit technical personnel for fishing boats. Recently, they sent cables to the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, requesting the establishment of a fisheries college in Shanghai, the national fisheries center, to cultivate talents.

### University Football League: Fudan and Hujiang Replay Ends in a 2-2 Draw. Absence of Fudan Stars Affects Strength, Hujiang Took Early Lead but Forced into Draw

[Our Newspaper] In the university football league, Fudan and Hujiang replayed their match yesterday afternoon at the John's Field. The referee was Zhuang Yikai, and the linesmen were Zhu Dehui and Chen Zhigang. More than a hundred cheerleaders from both sides came to the stadium to cheer. Fudan's forward Ren Jiagui was injured in the friendly match with the Global Sports Association football team the day before and was unable to participate. Defender Wang Hesheng also did not appear. Therefore, although the offensive was strong, it often had a momentum that was lacking at critical moments, which was a pity. Hujiang was unusually lucky yesterday, with many unexpected and wonderful performances. The whole team played especially hard because they had the opportunity to replay the match. Therefore, they took the lead with a score of 2-0, but in the end, they could not withstand the skillful and rapid offensive of Fudan, and had to share the world equally. The result was 2-2. The first half ended 0-0 with no score.

Fierce Battle Between Both Sides Fails to Open the Record

When the whistle sounded, Hujiang first got a corner kick. Zheng Deyao flew up to head the ball, but although it did not score, it scared Fudan into action. The ball then often rotated in front of Hujiang's goal. Wang Dingqiu was distracted and shot too high at first, and then shot even higher. Fan Sijie crossed the ball high, but He Mingbi kicked it off target again. Qian Jiaju kicked three corner kicks, but did not recognize the weather conditions, and they were all blown out of the field by the wind. Fan Sijie kicked two corner kicks, but they were not high enough and were intercepted in the middle. Fudan's offensive was extremely fierce and there were many shooting opportunities, but the ball luck was not good and they did not score, which was a pity. The first half ended with a score of 0-0.

Favorable Weather Conditions Give Hujiang Luck

Changing formations and fighting again, Hujiang sent the ball with the wind, taking a commanding position and using the favorable weather conditions (the John's Field is low in the south and high in the north, and the north wind was strong at the time). In less than five minutes, Tu Biyi flew the ball high into the middle, and Wu Jingren kicked it into the goal, scoring the first goal. Immediately after, Fudan's defender committed a handball inside the boundary, and Hujiang captain Zheng Deyao scored another goal, giving Hujiang an absolute advantage of 2-0. The Hujiang cheerleaders rose to the sound of the whistle. Mi Ji Hujiang's Chen Baogen suffered a leg cramp and fell to the ground, and was carried out. Hujiang general Zhang Fuqi injured his finger, and Zhao Yaozhang was called up.

Taking the Opportunity to Rise, Fudan Retaliates

Fudan took the opportunity to rise up, and there was a fierce battle in front of the Hujiang goal. Xiang Ba got the opportunity to lightly push the ball into the goal, and Fudan's momentum was strong. Later, Wang Dingqiu got a penalty kick, but he was too eager to win and his foot was too heavy, and the ball flew over the goal. Soon after, Qian Jiaju dribbled the ball straight along the edge and suddenly swept it in front of the goal. Just as the ball was about to fall, Fan Sijie turned around and headed it straight into the net, scoring a goal. The two sides tied the score at 2-2. Fan Sijie was embraced by his teammates and returned to the team, which was very exciting and enthusiastic. After this, Fudan's offensive became even tighter, and there were several fierce battles in front of the Hujiang goal, but Hujiang's goal was lucky again and again, turning danger into safety. At this time, Fudan's Xiang Ba had a very wonderful performance, that is, he fell down and hooked the ball from the top of his head, but unfortunately it hit the post and bounced back. As time ran out, the two sides tied with a score of 2-2.

### Ninety Minutes of Bitter Fight: Donghua Wins Against Jewish by One Goal, Han Longhai Secured the Victory in the Last Five Minutes

(Our Newspaper) The Group A football match between Donghua and Jewish was held at Yiyuan yesterday afternoon. It was a cold winter day, and there were only a little over a thousand spectators. Jewish was late due to a misunderstanding of the location, and the match started at 2:55 p.m. Unexpectedly, Donghua was in a bitter fight and was often under pressure from Jewish. The first half ended 0-0 with no score. It was not until the last five minutes that Han Longhai rolled into the net with the ball, and Donghua defeated Jewish by a score of 1-0, creating a record of six wins in six matches. The victory was extremely dangerous. The referee yesterday was Chen Jixiang, and the linesmen were Le Xiurong and Huang Ren.

Three Times Not Scoring

Zai Linjing, who had been away from the battlefield for a long time, served as the center forward yesterday. Donghua's offensive was very strong when he came on the field, and there were three very good opportunities, but he did not score each time, which was a pity. Jewish's counterattack repeatedly showed dangerous signs. Once, Han Longbo saved the day, almost staging a fun drama of scoring against his own team. The first half ended 0-0.

Sending Off a Penalty

Donghua repeatedly failed to score, resulting in a boring game. In the second half, Lin Wenhu replaced Li Ning. Five minutes later, Kopstein fouled Li in the penalty area, and the referee Chen Jixiang awarded a penalty kick. The Jews expressed their dissatisfaction, and Han Longhai deliberately kicked the ball off to the side to show "beauty". As time was running out, Donghua still had nothing to gain, and the audience felt sorry for Donghua, because the Group A score was very important.

Last Five Minutes

At thirty-eight minutes, Jewish's Stern broke through three passes in a row and was about to reach Donghua's goal. Yu Qixing and Chi Guozheng were in a hurry and hooked the ball with their feet, actually shooting at their own goal. The Chinese audience was horrified, but it made the fans sweat. In the last five minutes, Donghua's fortune turned around, and Lun sent the ball forward. Li passed the ball to A Sun. At the edge of the goal, the ball actually passed through the enemy's goal. Han Longhai caught up, and rolled into the net with the ball and person. Cheers rose from all around, and Donghua overcame Jewish by a score of 1-0.

### The Cradle of the New Navy

— Our Qingdao Correspondent Hang Zhou

Qingdao, 18th Dispatch

From the Liaodong Peninsula in the north to Hainan Island in the south, passing through the Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea, East China Sea, and South China Sea, our national defense line spans the seven provinces of Liaoning, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong. In this era where military force is essential for survival, before the War of Resistance, the total tonnage of the navy used for defense was over 44,000 tons, roughly equivalent to the tonnage of one battleship. It was the first to be destroyed by the enemy when the War of Resistance broke out.

However, the new navy has now reached its first anniversary!

A New Foundation

"Backed by Laoshan Mountain, facing the Yellow Sea, and embracing Jiaozhou Bay to the west," this terrain indicates that Qingdao is an outstanding naval base. As Admiral Kirk, Commander of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, stated: "Qingdao's harbor is the best in the Far East." Walking slowly along the tranquil and beautiful Haiyang Road, facing the sea breeze, a startling slogan comes into view: "Without naval defense, there is no national defense!" Behind the wall where the slogan is written, stands a magnificent building. This is the cradle of China's new navy, or rather, "China's Whampoa Military Academy for the Navy" – the Central Naval Training Group's location.

When the United States generously gifted China 271 surplus warships as the foundation for the new navy, a serious question arose: "Who will receive, manage, and operate these many warships?" At that time, Chairman Chiang, after discussing with then-Commander of the Seventh Fleet, Vice Admiral Barbey, in Chongqing, conceived the seed of the Central Naval Training Group. It was formally established on December 20th, assigning Navy Colonel Lin Xiangguang, who had extensive experience in naval studies and had served as our naval attaché in the United States and the head of the naval department of the Ministry of Military Administration, as its director; and Navy Lieutenant Colonel Chen Zantang as his deputy.

Although the Naval Training Group bears the title "Central," it is actually a joint Sino-American operation. The U.S. Seventh Fleet specifically organized a "Chinese Amphibious Training Group," which they abbreviated as "C.A.T.G.," to jointly oversee training matters. However, they operate under the title of "Advisory Group," with Colonel Cutting as the chief advisor, and Colonel Hibler as his deputy. It has training, medical, supply, and personnel sections, as well as transportation and management units. There are over twenty officers and sixty soldiers in total. The salaries are paid by the U.S. side.

Training Methods

Ninety-nine percent of all the equipment and materials needed for training are provided by the U.S. side, with a total value exceeding 10 billion legal tender. Our corresponding construction is less than 100 million yuan. The funds allocated by the central government over the past year have also been only 560 million yuan.

The mission of establishing the Naval Training Group determines the training methods. It is a wartime emergency training method modeled after the United States, as the two slogans of the Naval Training Group proclaim: "Train and practice immediately, practice and use immediately." Trainees are selected by the Naval Headquarters, mostly having graduated from naval academies and received basic theoretical education, before being taught the latest operational techniques, enabling them to serve at sea in a short period.

Land Training Phase

Training is divided into "land training" and "ship training" phases. "Land training" sets up various specialized training classes, including navigation, machinery, gunnery, seamanship, electrical, signaling, telecommunications, radar, gyrocompass, gunnery command, and small boat repair and mechanical classes. Each student understands the use of various technologies through models, charts, educational films, and instructors' explanations, so that they can handle them easily in the "ship training" phase. This period lasts from twelve to twenty weeks.

Ship Training

After "land training" is completed, actual ship training begins. This period is very short, from six to eight weeks. After completing the training, these big kids who dream of the sea and dream of one day wearing the beautiful naval uniform realize their ideals and become qualified sailors, serving on the ships where they were trained, their lives closely linked to maritime transport.

"A Ratio of Fifty to Fifty" – Gunner Instructor Lu Zhendan, 25, said: "China and the United States are equally responsible for training. A joint Sino-American meeting is held every Monday to discuss training progress. A joint Sino-English inspection is held every Saturday. At the same time, an examination is held every weekend." The Naval Training Group also has a political department, responsible for educational affairs, headed by Army Major General Tao Guanya, who formerly served as the deputy director of the Third Department of the Political Department.

Trained Officers

Time flies quickly, a year has passed. There have been six graduating classes, totaling 200 officers and 2,000 soldiers, receiving 27 ships donated by the United States, with a total of more than 61,000 tons, exceeding our country's pre-war total naval tonnage of more than 17,000 tons. These ships have been formed into fleets and are patrolling the seas of China. Their silhouettes can also be found in the distant Xisha, Nansha, and Tuansha island groups.

There are still 100 officers and 500 soldiers undergoing training. This is the seventh class.

In addition, the Naval Training Group also has three training classes: (1) Supply Class: training supply personnel. (2) Officer Supplementary Training Class: soldiers promoted to officers are sent back for training. (3) Midshipman Training Class: a batch of students who have just graduated from naval academies receive training here.

A Glimpse of the Classroom

Lu Zhendan led the reporter to visit various classrooms. In the American prefabricated houses, the future sailors are diligently learning. This is signaling, this is electricity, this is radar... Military science is the synthesis of all sciences, and especially so in the navy. "In the vast expanse of naval knowledge and technology, they may still be a group of elementary school students!" I thought: "But it is already commendable!"

We went to a warship. This is a four-thousand-ton Haskell-class amphibious assault ship, which participated in the Battle of the Philippines and was damaged. It has been received and is now named "Zhongdiao," for "Ship Training" use. I visited every department, stood on the deck, and looked at the vast sea. I entered a dreamlike state, I dreamed that one day this vast sea would be filled with warships flying the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth flag! But I immediately felt a heavy burden for my thoughts! A comrade on the ship pointed to the radar and told me: "Using this equipment, we can detect whether incoming aircraft are British? Soviet? Japanese?... This is a secret! The Americans didn't teach us this!" He said, smiling self-deprecatingly.

Lifestyle

Naval life is relatively interesting. In addition to eight hours of classes during training, trainees get plenty of entertainment opportunities. They have organized a club, which is well equipped, and movies are shown three times a week. There used to be weekend dances, but perhaps it was considered a bit extravagant, so it was later canceled. In terms of salary, the navy is one level higher than the army. That is, a naval lieutenant is equivalent to an army captain's pay. When serving at sea, there is an additional allowance, amounting to six-tenths of the salary.

A year has passed, it's truly not easy! The 22nd of this month is the first anniversary of the establishment of the Naval Training Group. In this chaotic year, having this foundation in the navy is a source of some comfort, isn't it? However, this anemic infant, drinking American "milk," wearing American "clothes," and playing with American "toys," is still so small. The training of officers and soldiers to receive the 271 surplus American warships will require much effort and time (currently in the first phase, only receiving amphibious assault ships, then receiving supply ships, cruisers, etc.); but when we think of Whampoa in its early days, wasn't it also like a weak sapling? And later, it became the backbone of China's new army! Now we bless it—the new Chinese navy, may it grow stronger!

A portion of the classrooms of the Central Naval Training Group [Land Training] is composed of American prefabricated iron houses (Dispatch from our correspondent Hang Zhou)

### The 11th National Assembly Meeting: Review Report on the Draft Constitution (Continued and Concluded)

Also, when reviewing Article 26 of the draft constitution, the Muslim representatives and indigenous representatives argued that the election of National Assembly representatives from the ethnic minorities in the border areas should also be explicitly stipulated in this article. After much contention, it was resolved that: "Regarding the ethnic minorities in the border areas (including Muslims and indigenous peoples), to assist their development so that they can enjoy the practical benefits of freedom and equality in political, economic, and educational aspects, it should be clearly stipulated in the fundamental national policy and election chapter of the constitution, reported to the presidium by the conveners of this meeting." When reviewing "Chapter 14: Implementation and Amendment of the Constitution" of the draft constitution, most representatives believed that there should be transitional provisions. After a vote, the following provisions were included in the constitution:

1. Article 151 of the draft constitution is amended to:

"The procedures for implementing this constitution shall be formulated by the National Assembly that drafted the constitution in accordance with the law on procedures for implementing the constitution."

2. Add a new article:

"The National Assembly that drafted the constitution shall be responsible for supervising and promoting the implementation of the constitution. The term of office of its representatives shall end on the day when the National Assembly established in accordance with this constitution convenes." In addition, the following two points were agreed upon by most representatives:

1. The representative proposed "To establish a committee to supervise the implementation of constitutional governance during the adjournment of the National Assembly that drafted the constitution, and the measures shall be determined separately." The resolution was passed in principle and sent to the comprehensive review committee to determine the measures.

2. Proposed that "The 'Law on Procedures for Implementing the Constitution' mentioned in the amended Article 151 shall be formulated by the National Assembly." The resolution was passed and sent to the comprehensive review committee to determine the measures.

The review work of this committee has been completed, so the more important sections are described above. The attached entire review and amendment of Chapter 3 and Chapter 14 are submitted for public decision by the presidium of the National Assembly.

Conveners of the Second Review Committee:

Shao Lizi, Lin Bin, Yi Weijing

Zhang Qiang, Zhu Hongru, Wang Puhan

Zeng Jikuan, Huang Yuren, Liu Zhiping

Review Report of the Third Review Committee

A. Scope of Review: From Chapter 4, President, Articles 36 to 53, Chapter 5, Administration, Articles 54 to 61, Chapter 6, Legislation, Articles 62 to 81.

B. Key Review Points:

1. Countersignature of presidential decrees, 2. Amnesty decrees, 3. Emergency decrees, 4. Consent of the Legislative Yuan for the appointment of the President of the Executive Yuan. The amendments and more contentious issues are briefly explained as follows.

Before discussing the articles of this chapter, Representative Wang, Representative Xuan, and Representative Chang advocated that Chapter 4 should be changed to the National Government or the Central Government, and that the President, Executive, and Legislative branches should be listed as sections. It was resolved to refer it to the Comprehensive Review Committee for discussion.

(1) Countersignature Issue: The original article of Article 38 stated that presidential decrees must be countersigned by the President of the Executive Yuan or the President of the Executive Yuan and the heads of relevant ministries. This countersignature power aroused opposition from some people. After some time of discussion, no decision could be made. Only in the last debate, the original article was passed by a majority and sent to the Comprehensive Review Committee for discussion.

(2) Amnesty Decree: Article 41 listed the power of "amnesty" among the powers exercised by the President. Some people believed that the power of amnesty had a strong autocratic and feudal color and should be abolished. As a result, the amendment opinion deleted "amnesty."

(3) Emergency Decree: Article 44 listed two factors for the President to issue an emergency decree: one was natural disasters and epidemics, and the other was national finance and economy. After fierce debate, it was believed that natural disasters could include epidemics, and the word "national" need not be added before finance and economy. At the same time, it was pointed out that the most important factor for issuing an emergency decree should be an emergency event

### Miscellaneous Items on Peking Opera

— Feng Chang

Cheng Yanqiu's Undefeated Status

This time, with Mei and Cheng performing opposite each other, Cheng won in terms of the total number of tickets sold, but lost in terms of the percentage of seats filled. Moreover, Mei's audience was consistently good every day, while Cheng's was not, sometimes packed and sometimes only 70% full, lacking stability. From this, we can see that Mei's audience is more general, while Cheng's audience has a narrower range. People who watch Mei Lanfang only need Mei Lanfang to be on stage, but those who watch Cheng Yanqiu are more concerned about the specific opera he is performing.

The battle between Cheng Yanqiu and Mei Lanfang was essentially taking advantage of leisure to attack labor (Mei Lanfang had already performed for three periods in Nanjing, Majestic, and Queen theaters, and Cheng Yanqiu had been on stage for many days while Mei Lanfang had been performing in China for quite some time). It should have been easy for Cheng to win, but the reason he hasn't is that he still can't compete with Mei Lanfang's general popularity.

However, in terms of this performance's results, Cheng Yanqiu, although not winning, is not defeated. From Cheng Yanqiu's perspective, it can be considered satisfactory. But if the competition were to be prolonged for a long time, not only would both sides suffer, but Cheng Yanqiu might need to wait a long time before he could return to Shanghai to perform. Otherwise, he would have to put on top-notch operas every day to attract audiences.

Tan Fuying's Misfortune

Tan Fuying and Yang Baosen both seem to have brought bad luck to the old male actors. Since then, the "Four Great Old Male Actors" have been outshone by Mei and Cheng. Although Tan Fuying performed "Zhan Taiping" as the finale once at the Tianchan Theater (with Cheng Yanqiu's "Yutang Chun" as the penultimate performance), it was only once. Now that Cheng Yanqiu is about to leave, he probably won't have another chance to perform the finale. I was in the audience that night of "Zhan Taiping," and the ticket sales were not bad, almost full, or perhaps already full. But the reason why it never became the finale again is likely due to Cheng Yanqiu's unwillingness. The reason why he was allowed to perform it once was due to the conditions promised when Tan Fuying was invited.

Tan Fuying apparently has the status of a second-tier actor at the Tianchan Theater. At the same time, there is also the suspicion of him sharing the second-tier status with Ye Shengian. At least Ye Shengian is a "second and a half" tier actor, not third-tier, because Ye's "Zhenzhou" was once performed before Tan's. But because Tan Fuying often performed on the same stage with Ye Shengian, he always accompanied them by singing "Yellow Crane Tower," "Gathering of Heroes," "Eight Hammering Dogs," "Severed Arm Storytelling," and "Ganlu Temple," none of which are his signature operas. Especially recently, Tan Fuying's dialogue has greatly declined, so "Yellow Crane Tower," "Gathering of Heroes," and "Severed Arm Storytelling" can be said to be his least favorite operas.

Tan Fuying sings "non-signature operas" more often than "signature operas" at the Tianchan Theater.

Tan Fuying can be said to have bad luck.

But his misfortune this time can be said to be self-inflicted. Who told him to sell tickets for 18,000 during the Queen Theater period? If he had sold them for 12,000, I believe that even if Mei Lanfang and Cheng Yanqiu sold them for 20,000 today, people wouldn't say their ticket prices were cheap or unreasonable. Perhaps they wouldn't even be selling tickets for 20,000 today, or if they did, perhaps they wouldn't sell as well as they do today.

Yang Baosen's Diminished Color

When Yang Baosen is with Mei Lanfang, people only listen to Mei Lanfang and rarely listen to Yang Baosen. Even though Yang Baosen performs good operas every day, people rarely study his operas.

"Qi Yuan Bao" and "Empty City Stratagem" are Yang Baosen's signature operas, but few people use these two operas as material for after-dinner Peking opera discussions. "Wen Zhaoguan" is his most beautiful opera, perhaps a "swan song" today, but it has never been performed.

Yang Baosen used to be a top star in Shanghai and sold out several times, but why don't his audiences come today?

But he is much better than Tan Fuying, at least he can have his way with...

Isn't this Yang Baosen's bad luck again?

Generally speaking, it is difficult to have both fame and fortune. It is said that Tan Fuying and Yang Baosen are not bad in terms of "fortune". Isn't the "Tan Yang Incident" another proof?

Wang Shaolou's Sorrow

Wang Shaolou left with great reputation last time, but this time he returns with a damaged reputation. In these few years, he has declined a lot. He is very down and out in Beijing, singing quick scripts of "Eight Immortals Attaining the Tao" with mechanical sets and light bulbs on his head in the Guangde Theater, and he is not even welcomed. This time at the Tianchan Theater, he arrived late, and after arriving, he didn't have any operas assigned to him for several days. The first opera he was assigned was to play Pinggui in "Xue Pinggui and Wang Baochuan," but he temporarily refused because it was a role for a supporting actor, and performing it on the first day would be too demeaning. So the old supporting actor Zhang Chunyan went on stage temporarily.

No one knows whether Wang Shaolou is good or bad. Seeing that his name is listed high above Yuan Shihai, although Cheng Yanqiu's consideration may also be a factor, it seems that he shouldn't be that bad. Who knows if his coming to Shanghai to perform is entirely out of Cheng Yanqiu's consideration.

His first official appearance was in "Qun Ying Hui," where he sang Lu Su and Tan Fuying sang Jiang Gan. Later, he couldn't even sing Lu Su, and after two performances, he "gave" it to Tan Fuying without any compensation. Many people thought that he could sing Qiao Xuan Lu Su in another opera, "Ganlu Temple," to the end, because Tan Fuying was unwilling to sing that role. Who knew that even three days before the performance, he was still not spared, and Qiao Xuan Lu Su was unconditionally given to Song Yusheng, who had already been discarded by the Tianchan Theater. In Cheng Yanqiu's "He Hou Zhuan," it has always been a main old male actor who plays the role. After calculating left and right, it should have been him who played Zhao Kuangyi and sat on the high platform. But for some reason, Cheng Yanqiu also broke the previous record and let the supporting old male actor Li Shilin climb up.

The only thing left is Li Jing in "Hong Fu Zhuan," which he hasn't yet given up. But it looks like Cheng Yanqiu doesn't want to perform that opera again before leaving. Wang Shaolou, when he came on stage this time, shouted that he had no voice and kept his head down, looking very shy. I think it's probably related to "hanging a high name, taking the money, but not being able to perform." Wang Shaolou really has great sorrow!

Kylin Tong's Stubbornness

Kylin Tong has been exceptionally stubborn in recent years. He always believes that his three big characters still have appeal. With him on stage, his fee must be able to compete with any "giant" star, but for his supporting actors, he tries to use "cheap goods" as much as possible. Therefore, every time he goes on stage, it results in a "Zhou Xinfang's script, Kylin Tong makes money" situation. (Zhou Xinfang is Kylin Tong, and Kylin Tong is the mainstay of the Golden Theater and also a major shareholder of the Golden Theater. He uses the real name Zhou Xinfang in his capacity as a shareholder.)

Because his ideals are all wrong, his appeal is far less than before, so the results are always failures. But he is very stubborn and believes that he is absolutely right. The so-called "failure" is the "mother of success." So to this day, he still regards himself as a good medicine to save the Golden Theater from danger. The worst ticket sales at the Golden Theater recently are due to Kylin Tong's stubbornness.

### Random Talks on New Films

— Ma Boliang

China Girl

The female protagonist, Miss Yang, is just a foreigner wearing a cheongsam. Hollywood has repeatedly misunderstood China, especially Chinese women. They have made films about Norway, the Soviet Union, and France, but Hollywood should apologize for its depiction of China during the war of resistance. "Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth," "Long Live China," and even this "China Girl" all exaggerate Americans into invincible heroes with three heads and six arms, inevitably obliterating the spirit and strength of the Chinese people's struggle. Therefore, even if the screenwriter stands on the side of sympathy for China and depicts the reality of enemy troops massacring innocent civilians, they still inevitably overlook China and are superficial. The structure of the script is chaotic and lacks a central focus. The screenwriter simply doesn't know whether to develop the story of "China Girl" based on the film's title or prepare to express a spy story. If the emphasis is on "China Girl," the spy story is irrelevant and can be deleted. Otherwise, the latter part becomes a farce, which is not in line with the intention of the spy film, which is ridiculous. Under the crude arrangements of the screenwriter, the director has no way to implement, although there are some commendable aspects, it is not a success. The actors are also not outstanding, just so-so, turning it into a C-grade film. Of the whole film, I only remember three points: in the line of people being shot, an old man looking back, a final review of the country under the moonlight, is utterly tragic; and under the great bombing of Kunming, the students sitting calmly and the lovers escaping. Except for these, everything feels exaggerated.

Tears of Rouge

Love is the unique world of women. A woman's life starts from the happiness of her love. Although they are sisters, they take different paths in love, and once they go down that path, there are few days of return. Thinking of the dreams in the boudoir, they are always desolate. "Tears of Rouge" has the three best stereotypes, every laugh and cry is real. In the world of every woman, we can find the shadow of them. Those tears are not only shed for British women, but for women all over the earth. Because it is real, this film has the lightness that is usually missing in British films. Some places are too light, and the director has not tried hard, just passing through the plot, leaving no color, and lacking the sentimentalism in American films. The mood isn't even kept together to make a bright memory. But the screenwriter and director have deep and insightful characterizations, even excessive micro-features. The actors' performances are very stable. James Mason is the leading man in England, his stern and strong personality is fully revealed, no wonder he is very popular in the United States, nicknamed "the Clark Gable of England"; Phyllis Calvert recently won the British Acting Award. Compared to "Blooming Side by Side," she has a new temperament here; the one-sister is delicate and pitiful, the three-sister is beautiful and similar to France's Danielle Darrieux, the brother-in-law's demeanor, each has its own merits. Worth mentioning is the children's play, the three-sister's daughter crying and hiding, and the scene of peeking through the door can be said to be seamless, and perfectly in place.

The Web

G-MAN detective films are outdated, and smart audiences no longer welcome scenes of mass killings, replaced by psychological stimulation. Detective films like "The Train Murder Case" and "Green Window Shadows" are no longer simple detective films, but highly dramatic works. "The Web" takes a similar path. The director is very good at using the camera, and the montage technique is used a lot, but it still cannot make this film concise and smooth, because the script is too complicated, with too much dialogue and too many red herrings, leading the audience to have no way to explore. This film is just a section of glittering mysterious gems, with no shortage of amazing things, the illusion after being attacked with fragrance is one example. Dick Powell has changed his style and is much more experienced. Only he can be said to have succeeded in "The Web"!

Star Spangled Rhythm

A show with a gathering of stars is like a Chinese stir-fry, a mixture of everything. "Star Spangled Rhythm" is one of many old story lines, with no directorial skills or writing intentions whatsoever. Good and bad are swallowed together. People have nothing better to do than join the fun. Elody 林, 克卡遜, and奥丽机地哈苐兰's songs and dances are pretty cute. 娜苏亚 is a unique American singing star, even more popular than 珍妮麦唐纳, with a mellow voice that lives up to her name.埃第康迪 aside from being surrounded by dogs, is too noisy and offensive.瓊兰丝莲's humor is the biggest harvest, and we always have many expectations for her.

Spring and Autumn

### Memories of Hengyang

— Cheng Tixuan

Hengyang is located in a strategic area, which is a must-win place for military strategists. In the autumn of the 33rd year of the Republic of China (1944), the Japanese invaders invaded, and the Tenth Army of Fang Xianjue fought bitterly with them for forty-eight days, causing excessive casualties, and finally became a lair for the Japanese due to running out of ammunition and reinforcements for many years. In this battle, bayonets were crossed, and blue blood formed channels, which was enough to shock the world and move the gods, making it a magnificent and glorious page in the history of the War of Resistance. Now that the sea has calmed down and the mountain is returning to spring, the Hengyang City Council has requested to build a memorial city on that land to symbolize the spirit of our country's resistance to foreign aggression, shine through the ages, and be immortal. The intention is very good. I was reminded of the days when I lived in Chongqing and wrote two chapters of "Remembering Hengyang" to describe the incident. If there are compilers of the poetic history of the War of Resistance, perhaps they can also be used as a source of materials! The poems are recorded later (with a preface):

Since after the Double Fifth Festival of this year (referring to the 33rd year of the Republic of China), the Japanese invaders gathered a large army and attacked Hengyang fiercely, which lasted for more than a month; and the isolated city was defended firmly, and every inch of land was contested. The lunar orb was reborn, brightly seeing the moon of the third day; the whale atmosphere gradually reduced, and the green number seventy-two peaks. The rivers and mountains are effective, and the strong captives will be wiped out; the river will return to me, and the triumphant songs will be played. But the flames of war are in Xiangxiang, and my relatives and friends are thousands of miles away. Sending books does not reach me, and I think of the scales of the carp in the river; I stand alone and ponder, and I look at the flying geese in the sky.

Yueyun became an array to protect the flags, and the sunset isolated city moved away thoughts.

Has the news of the whale cut off been sent for thousands of miles? Several letters were sent late by the returning geese.

The desolate suburbs seem to hear the poor people weeping, and the theater county allows the cunning captives to peek.

Seventy-two peaks are above the sky ruler, and I see the moon like a crescent again tonight.

Ten days ago (referring to the end of July in the 33rd year of the Republic of China), I wrote a poem "Remembering Hengyang", thinking of the bravery of many scholars in Dengpei, and sending the thoughts of the sunset in the isolated city. Fang looked at the tall Qiao mountains, the positive battle of Xiongxiong; I did not expect the demon atmosphere to cover the field, and it became the most of the jackals and tigers. The poor captives poured out their nests, how different is it from one cast; the strong men reported to the country, and they have a thousand autumns to write your dan heart, pay it to the green history.

The isolated city has been surrounded by heavy sieges for more than a month, and I want to see Deng Pei shooting the sunset.

Looking south, Bin Hong was shocked that the letter was broken, and Huma came from the east and was fat in autumn.

Thousands of feet of clouds and mountains support the heavenly pillars, and hundreds of battles in Hunan and Hunan shake the country's prestige.

How can the past be described as Suiyang, and there is still the remaining brilliance of accumulated blood.

### Rambling on Female Writers—Feng Zi Strolling in the Art World

— Tan Yi

Feng Zi's surname is Feng - this surname seems rarely seen in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang areas. Yes! She is not from Jiangsu or Zhejiang, she was born in Hubei, went to school in Shanghai, but her ancestral home is Guangxi. To this day, her old father and brothers (she is the youngest) still live in Guilin.

This is not a secret, because she went to Guilin to attend her mother's funeral this spring. At that time, she wrote articles about Guilin, and newspapers also carried news of her trip to Guilin. But, if you ignore this fact and only listen to her fluent northern dialect, you will not only not believe that she is a southern girl, but you will also doubt that she was educated in Shanghai!

Speaking of Feng Zi, one cannot help but think of her starring role in "Hometown of White Clouds". Therefore, some people think that Feng Zi is a movie star. In fact, rather than calling her a movie star, it is better to say that she is a drama actress. Because her experience in drama is actually more than in movies. Not only has she recently starred in "Kingdom of Heaven and Spring and Autumn", but when she was studying at Fudan University, she also performed Cao Yu's "Thunderstorm". Later, she went to Japan to perform "Sunrise". During the War of Resistance, in Hong Kong, Guilin, Kunming, and finally in Chongqing, she repeatedly participated in drama work. She wrote a "Strolling Stage," using a prose style to write about her experiences and insights on drama, which was serialized in the drama weekly of Chongqing's Xinmin Evening News.

But the first time she returned to Shanghai after the victory, it was as a female reporter, taking a car from Zhijiang and flying directly to Nanjing. And as the only woman to participate in the surrender ceremony. It turned out that she was already a reporter for Xinmin Newspaper at that time.

Soon, she stopped field work and became the editor of the supplement of the Heping Daily. Later, she also served as the editor of the supplements of the Jinghu Three-Day Journal and the National Afternoon Daily, and at the same time published works in major magazines such as Shanghai Renaissance, Wen Chao Monthly, and Literary Spring and Autumn, but most of what was published were essays. In addition to her debut work "The Silent Singing Girl" published by Zhengyan Publishing House, she also made a second masterpiece.

From drama to film, and from film to female reporter, to supplement editor, to professional writer, it seems to have changed very quickly and a lot. In fact, whether it's film or drama, journalism or editing, whether it's displaying sound and action to the audience or portraying it to the reader with a flowery pen, she has always lived in the atmosphere of literature and art, and she has always lived and worked for literature and art. It's just that the way of performing is different. And with her talent, the screen, the stage, the newspapers, the magazines, are just like the corridor where she freely comes and goes, the grassland where she strolls leisurely. She is like dancing on the keyboard of a piano, and every note is enough to show her genius. Just like her daily life, she can grasp the appropriate position everywhere and capture the elite at the forefront of life. When something is not yet mature, she will never reveal a word even in front of her best friends. When victory first came, everyone was running around for transportation, and when friends met, they always asked each other if they had any solutions, but five minutes before she got into the car to Zhijiang to take the plane, she still hadn't told her friends that she had found a way. The same was true of going from Shanghai to Guilin.

Some people think that Feng Zi's actions are a bit mysterious, but it is just a part of her personality. In good conscience, she didn't mean to hide it from you. So, if we suddenly hear that Feng Zi has gone to the United States on a regular basis recently, or when the news reaches our ears, her ship has already passed Honolulu, there is no need to be surprised.

### Scenery

— Ke Luo

Corot (J.B. Camille Corot 1796-1875) was a famous landscape painter of the 19th century. He lived in Barbizon Village with Millet, so historians called them the Barbizon School. He was not only good at landscapes, but also at portraits. His paintings are natural and poetic. (Lion)

### Homecoming Poetry Chronicle

— Lu Baihua

The Great Buddha is Safe

When discussing the famous mountains in my hometown, although Li Taibai praised the majesty of Mount Tianmu, it is too far away from the city after all. It can be said that I have never been there since I was born, and it is said that it is not surprising. The flat-like hills, chaotic rocks and weeds, and the stele of "Li Bai Dreaming" exist, but they ultimately belong to the poet fairy's fantasy. The famous mountain is Nanming Mountain, five miles west of the city. There is "Dafosi (Great Buddha Temple)" on the mountain, which is indeed the first scenic spot in Zhejiang. Those who travel in eastern Zhejiang must visit our place to admire the Great Buddha. The history of the Great Buddha is very early. During the Five Dynasties, a wandering monk came to Nanming Mountain and made a vow to carve a stone Buddha ten feet high on Feiyan Cliff. Naturally, this was not something that could be accomplished in a short "decades". The monk died, and his disciples continued to carve, even after the third generation of disciples, and with the million-string assistance of King Qian Liu of Yue, this majestic stone Buddha sitting in the rock wall was completed. There is a well-sized hole in the top of the Buddha, which is connected to the water flowing deep in the window, because the main hall is paved with stone slabs, and the bottom is full of water. A pair of couplets at the gate of the hall is very accurate: "Ten feet of golden body opens the green wall, a thousand years of stone gaps spill cold sound". This makes it a good place to escape the summer heat.

The road to Dafosi was originally a mountain road, going straight up to Cuilang Pavilion, then turning east and going down to the mountain gate. Later, Zhang Zaiyang opened another highway. At that time, he was the governor of Zhejiang Province. He was a native of Xinchang, so naturally he wanted to promote the reputation of his hometown. After the completion of the highway, a row of Western-style houses was built opposite the temple, with the words "New Society" inscribed on them. His calligraphy was fat and round, and he was like a magpie's nest. He didn't visit himself, and he was allowed to be a place for the villagers to travel and rest. I still remember deeply that when I was a child, I almost went to Dafosi to play whenever I wanted, and I always liked to take the mountain road. Now, I and Zongen have come again. This is the most gratifying thing about my homecoming. Yes, my plan to return to my hometown is to revisit Nanming Mountain.

We left the South Gate and circled the city westwards. The clear and shallow water of the dike is still active with the childlike innocence of catching shrimp with a bottle. Zongen told me how he had walked under this with fear, passing the enemy's sentry post on the top of the mountain, on the night when he returned to his hometown to visit relatives while taking a break from being the magistrate of Fujian. I was silent, he was so difficult and great, and I, exhausted my pen, and achieved nothing. At the end of the dike, there is a mountain road, which is a winding and slanting stone step. The original state of the "East Yue Temple" cannot be found, only the broken clay statues are buried in the weeds. The mountain road became steeper, passing a cliff, it is said that the talented Luo Yin had been here! Calling its name will respond, which shows the naivety of the mountain city, and even the principle of empty valley echoes is not understood. Going up again is the "Cuilang Pavilion", we sat for a while, and felt that the complaints in our stomachs were washed away by the waves of the surrounding mountains and forests.

The stone steps that turn east and descend are difficult to walk on, in the middle of the cliff, narrow and slippery, but the mountain gate has also arrived. With a swoosh, a squirrel flashed under the horizontal pine branches, and the boundless green was rippling with clothes, and I felt refreshed. Inside the mountain gate, on the other side of the stone monument of "Nanming Shengjing" inscribed by Mi Fu, there is also a monument of "Tianzhuyiran", which is said to have been inscribed by Zhu Zi, because there is "Zhu Zi Reading Place" on it, and Canglang Pavilion enshrines the statue of Zhu Zi, which we also admired. A pair of couplets in front of the pavilion is wonderful: "Sun and Moon double wheels, heaven and earth eyes, poetry and books, hundreds of generations of sages and hearts." After that, we arrived at Dafosi, the Great Buddha is safe, but the golden body is much dimmer.

The light of the slanting pine reflects the squirrel,

The echo of the cliff calls the talented;

The mountain in front of Cuilang Pavilion is like a sword,

The thorns in the chest are temporarily opened.

The stalwart divide and support the pillar of the sky,

After singing Canglang, leave a stone inscription;

The Dharma eye and Confucian heart are shared for thousands of years,

Listen to the birds singing on Nanming Mountain!

### An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of Blood 129

— Ye Jingfeng

From Yuanzi's exploration, copies of both ordinary domestic and confidential international documents were kept in this study. As for the "Seven Sealed Letters," since she received the order, on this morning, within a few hours, by a lucky coincidence, she risked entering the study again. After searching, she was certain that they were stored in the basement. Whether they were the originals, copies, or both original and copies, she didn't know.

Why not simply risk exploring the basement? This was impossible, not only due to time constraints but because the basement had only one entrance. Perhaps there were also "mechanisms" with electric shock messages. Aside from Konoe himself, even the several confidential concubines who managed the study were said never to have gone down there. How could Yuanzi enter alone?

Then, how did she determine that the "Seven Sealed Letters" were definitely hidden in this basement? This wasn't Yuanzi's fantasy or speculation, but based on inferences from conversations with those confidential concubines. In advanced spy training, there was a subject on deduction and understanding. For places that couldn't be personally inspected, exploring their secret contents relied entirely on conjecture using deductive methods, like arithmetic or chemical analysis. To find an unknown quantity, you trace back from known points. To find an unknown element, you analyze with known reagents. While this method wasn't 100% reliable, it was 99% justifiable. International master spies could estimate troop and ammunition numbers, and operational goals, directions, etc., based solely on the train's travel time, frequency, and speed. This was one such method.

In the car, after listening to Yezhu's report on Yuanzi's work, Tsurumi asked for clarification on several key points. He had already formed a rough plan for exploring the "Seven Sealed Letters" in his mind. He only needed to get to Tokyo, discuss it with a few capable subordinates, and then announce the execution.

Although it sounded simple, the task was actually extremely difficult. First, the nature of the task was unusually fragile, like extracting a detonator from a two-ton bomb. One wrong move, and everything would be destroyed. The fragility lay in the need to accomplish the task without anyone noticing. They couldn't take the original and leave no trace of tampering. Otherwise, before the "Sealed Letters" were revealed, these devils would have already found a way to cover their tracks, or come up with other countermeasures, moving the "Sealed Letters" secretively, causing international supporters of justice and the general public to be confused and dubious. Then, even if revealed, it would be ineffective, a waste of effort.

Second, although Tsurumi was in charge of this task, he couldn't be exposed. In other words, he was only allowed to succeed, not to be discovered. Because after doing this, he had to maintain his current advantageous position and continue working until the war demons' plans were completely shattered and the world's war completely extinguished. Therefore, this matter had to be done without anyone noticing to be considered a success.

The nature of the matter was so fragile that it couldn't be done like other spies stealing secret documents or blueprints, forcefully and then running away. At the same time, it was necessary to consider that this item was placed in such a heavily guarded place with multiple layers of protection. Needless to say, there were Bufu's guards on the surface and confidential concubines specifically supervising it. These confidential concubines might be beautiful and gentle, but they shouldn't be underestimated. Take Yuanzi, for example. Not only was she clever and alert, but she could also use knives and guns. They were all fierce characters selected from hundreds, one in a thousand. Otherwise, why would Konoe put them in such important positions?

### Car

— Shaofu

A "Biegu Brand" car costs twenty gold bars. Even Xiao Xing's "Fiat" costs eight. The car class's status is different today.

A friend complained: "How can I willingly hide my talents? It's just that I don't have a car." So he listed reasons: "For example, after a meeting, walking out of the gate, others stand there imposing. 'Ford,' 'Shunfeng,' 'Chrysler,' glide from afar. Sometimes there are even burly bodyguards in special cars. They either slowly and leisurely step inside with an air of grandeur, or politely say to you, 'Let's go together'? 'Take my car'?" It can't help but make one think, "What a man does, so do I." Even if it rains and the road is slippery, you deserve to get wet. Either you catch a cold on a tricycle or sweat on the tram.

As for visiting friends, Jiangwan Road, Daxi Road, Xujiahui, are all in different directions. Not being a flying leg, it's better to save it."

My friend's words have merit. In Shanghai, you can't make a name for yourself without a car. People say there's gold everywhere on the streets, but you have to walk out to have a chance to pick it up. But how can a running friend have more chances to pick it up than the car class!

### Thief Swallows Watch, Big Shots Swallow Gold

— Jia Xuezhen

Same swallowing, different methods

In the newspaper on the 16th, there was a local news story about a thief who stole a watch from a watch shop and swallowed it. He almost got away with it. Later, after a policeman slapped him on the cheek, he finally spat out the loot, and both the person and the goods were caught.

This news made me realize that the progress of Shanghai thieves' skills is truly remarkable. But I still feel that this thief is one step behind: money, though small, is still difficult to swallow. Only gold is truly satisfactory. If you can't hold it in your mouth, you simply swallow it. If you're lucky, you can pick it up from the stool the next day and still use it. Perhaps he was always afraid that, in the event of misfortune, it would cost him his life. Therefore, he would rather work with the watch than joke with life. In fact, this is worrying for nothing. Look at how many big shots who specialize in swallowing gold bars are still swallowing today?

However, I have to say that their skills are indeed beyond the reach of the thieves. Even if their mouths are filled with gold, they can still give very pleasing and unnoticeable high-sounding theories. So they are guaranteed to have no danger of dying from swallowing. At the same time, the hands of the police will never visit their cheeks. They have no life-threatening danger or worries. So long live the big shots who swallow gold!

But someone asked me, what if one day, the big shots were forced to swallow the gold? There is probably a cure, I think. It is said that there is a medicine—also made of gold—that can make the swallowed gold come out with the stool, ensuring no danger to life. And the gold in the stool, although stinking, can still allow them to eat big dishes and build foreign houses...

Officers, be brave, raise your noble hands and slap the cheeks of these big shots. They will immediately open their blood basins like big mouths, and the yellow-gold will spill all over the ground!

### Respected Elder, Nankai Principal Zhang Boling

— Zhengfan

With a tall stature, purplish-red face, gray-white flat top, wearing a pair of glasses, holding a cane, the typical "Tianjin big belly," our Zhang Boling Guang-sheng has returned from the United States. Although he is over seventy years old, he still has the air of a "Yan Zhao Brave Warrior."

Mr. Zhang is a believer in old-style marriage. He said: "New-style marriages are too slick. Vanity is more important than any theory. They only know how to bury their heads and do things, but it's much better than being able to talk and write but not do. Moreover, new-style marriages are easy to divorce. If there is a disagreement, they fly away separately. Unlike old-style marriages where 'this road is blocked,' everyone has to give way, and then there is no problem."

In fact, Mr. Zhang is "practicing what he preaches." He and his wife, Ms. Wang Shuzhen, have always been a famous model couple. In 1935, Nankai alumni held a grand celebration for Principal Zhang's 40th wedding anniversary. Because it was ten years away from the "golden wedding," Mr. Zhang called himself a "gilded wedding." According to him, he and his wife had never had an argument. His career was all thanks to his illiterate wife. He calls his wife "Hey!"

Zhang's indomitable spirit is due to congenital heredity. His father was a poor scholar in Tianjin, played the pipa, and was known as "Pipa Zhang." His younger brother, Pengchun, was one of the most vigorous advocates of Chinese drama.

When Mr. Zhang was a child, he studied at the Beiyang Naval Academy, determined to be a naval hero. Later, he felt that the Chinese nation's knowledge was shallow and its body was bad, so he decided to abandon the navy and pursue education. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, Yan Fansun set up a private school in Tianjin and invited Mr. Zhang to be a professor of physics, chemistry, English, and mathematics. That private school became the prototype of today's famous Nankai University.

When Nankai first opened, there were only more than 70 students. However, under Mr. Zhang's difficult management, the school's career gradually developed from a private school to a primary school, middle school, girls' school, university, and research institute. Since its founding, it has cultivated countless talents.

At Nankai, he would get up at 6:00 every morning and walk around the school, planning how to improve the school. He is not good at rhetoric, but his speech is kind and simple. He often said this sentence: "Nankai's specialty is growing, growing, growing. It's always growing!"

Zhang Guangsheng has always held a detached attitude towards politics, "If my way is not followed, I will embark on a raft and float on the sea," not enthusiastic, not participating. But during the Anti-Japanese War, he resolutely led his students into the great era of resistance and construction. He was elected vice chairman of the National Political Council. He could endure hardship and resentment, always working hard, doing practical work, and working hard!

His whole life has been devoted to education. He only asks for cultivation, not harvest, unremittingly and tirelessly, with a radiant spirit, making us feel that Mr. Zhang Boling is getting younger and younger!

### Rapidly Declining Years

— Wangwu

Merchant A: In these rapidly declining years, what kind of business is good?

Merchant B: I think it's still best to sell coarse hemp rope, DDT. Come and kill...

Merchant A: What does that mean?

Merchant B: It's to make things convenient for everyone!

### Pre-War Deposits

— Cai

The bank does not take care of deposits, not because it is bankrupt and does not take care of deposits, but because it does not take care of deposits before the Anti-Japanese War.

Speaking of this bank, isn't it an above-average bank, and can be considered "highly reputable" in Hangzhou? It is located on Qiaotou Road and has a self-built foreign house, which is quite magnificent, namely the "Zhejiang Commercial Savings Bank."

Before the Anti-Japanese War, the author saved money and deposited 30 yuan per month in so-called "fixed deposits." I deposited this way continuously for five years. Suddenly, the Anti-Japanese War broke out. During these five years, in order to maintain deposit credibility, sometimes when I didn't have money to deposit, I raised money by taking clothes, in short, I put it together and pieced it in, and I never delayed a day. All I hoped for was a small amount of interest.

After August 13th, the bank swept everything away and fled to Jinhua, transferred to Zhongxi, and can be said to have not suffered the slightest damage. The Hangzhou branch site is still complete, so at the beginning of the victory, it was the first to ask about the resumption of business, and it has been a year and four months now.

The "Zhejiang Commercial Savings Bank" has not yet indicated that it will clear pre-war deposits. The author personally went to inquire several times, and each answer was off-topic. Recently, I was told "I'll talk about it later." Later is indefinitely remote, a thousand years, ten thousand years, just "not return" it.

The author's relatives and friends are all "depositors" of the bank. However, because the deposit numbers seem extremely small now, honestly, it's not worth suing; however, if we just let it go, then, isn't it too cheap for this big bank? I'm afraid there are countless depositors like me.

### Between Mother-in-Law and Daughter-in-Law (Part 2) Collective Opinion

Marriage Revolution

"Men marry women," the traditional marriage system with thousands of years of history, is of course difficult to change, but if it can be reversed, it will definitely reduce more than 90% of the irreconcilable disputes between families.

How to change it? It is to reverse "marrying off daughters" to "marrying off sons" and "taking daughters-in-law" to "taking sons-in-law."

Daughters stay at home, and when they reach marriageable age, they will marry a husband for her. When the sons reach adulthood, they will marry into the wife's family. In this way, the mother and daughter will naturally live together and get along well, and it will not easily cause trauma and rifts between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law. One daughter is of course no problem, even if there are three or four sisters, it doesn't matter, because sisters have the same interests and temperaments, which are generally the same. Compared with sisters-in-law, sisters-in-law, and mothers-in-law of different surnames, it is naturally easier to get along and not be jealous. In addition, on the basis of flesh and blood, they can cooperate and understand each other, and the family will naturally be harmonious.

As for mothers-in-law always loving their sons-in-law, and sons are always more likely to make a living outside, spending less time at home. After a long absence, the mother-in-law and son-in-law feel particularly close. If there are three or five brothers-in-law, it is also because each person spends more time outside and less time gathering. Reuniting during the New Year and festivals, they are naturally more cordial after a long absence, and will never argue and be incompatible like sisters-in-law who live together all day long.

If the mother-in-law's family has sons, of course those who are adults will marry out. Those who are still young and stay at home naturally have nothing to say when they are with their sisters, and they are still loving and harmonious with their brothers-in-law because they do not see each other all the time.

In this way, there is no such thing as mothers-in-law, sisters-in-law, and sisters-in-law, so the whole family is happy.

I wonder if anyone will agree with this absurd (?) ideal of changing the marriage system? (Yijin)

My Mother-in-Law

My mother-in-law, who is nearly sixty years old, is a kind and approachable person. She is very kind to people, whether they are neighbors or relatives and friends. I get along very well with her. She is very considerate of me. When I am busy with housework, she always helps from the side. As for me, I think of her as old and should not be too tired, so I mostly rush to do everything in front.

I have never forgotten what my husband said to me on the day of our wedding five years ago: "Qi-mei! My home is your home. Being filial to my mother is like respecting me. Raising children to prevent old age, accumulating grain to prevent famine. I leave the affairs of the family to you. With you, I can rest assured and there are no worries about internal affairs."

My mother-in-law is a devout Buddhist. She burns incense, lights candles, eats vegetarian food, and recites Buddha every lunar first and fifteenth day... It is her routine. I guess her original intention is nothing more than to ask the gods and Buddhas to bestow blessings and hope that the whole family will always be healthy and that everything will go smoothly. Everyone is free to believe in religion, but she seems to be a little too much, bordering on superstition. In the family, no matter who gets sick, she is very anxious. If the cold and fever do not go away in a day or two, she will buy a long ingot and burn it. She says that the patient has encountered "Chi Lao"—referring to a ghost—and it will be fine after sending it away; or go to the temple to burn incense, ask for a divination, and bring back a few packs of incense ash and tell the patient to take "spiritual medicine." But I know that this "spiritual medicine"—incense ash—is harmful to the disease, but I am embarrassed to disagree in front of her, so I "comply outwardly and disobey inwardly" and secretly discard it, and at the same time ask a doctor for treatment.

Because of this, she does not hold hostile views towards me. We are very good. (Zhu Yunqi)

Not a Joke

There is a story in my hometown that is told as a "joke." It is said that a widow, her only son is very filial, on the night of her son's wedding, this mother-in-law unexpectedly moved to sleep on the young couple's new bed, and built a pile of isolated "barriers" between the two, which was very embarrassing for her son and daughter-in-law for a long time. I think this is definitely not a completely absurd "joke" but a very profound allegory. (Jingtian)

Son's Depression

The discord between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law undoubtedly distresses those who are "mother's son" and "wife's husband."

In order not to be a suspect of "marrying a daughter-in-law and losing my mother" or "mother and son jointly abusing the daughter-in-law", I was plunged into a deep abyss of extreme pain; therefore, my will was very depressed, and even lifeless, I repeatedly wanted to destroy myself, and leave this "hell-like" home forever, to go to another world.

To eliminate the "discord between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law," the most thorough way is to separate. But the problem comes, try to imagine in this "inch of gold" and the difficult life in the city, how can it be done? Even if it is possible, the environment is not allowed! Because according to convention, when the daughter-in-law enters the door, the mother-in-law can unload her responsibilities to enjoy Qingfu and wear away the remaining years. Moreover, it is still questionable whether the mother-in-law is willing to live a lonely life? So the separation of mother-in-law and daughter-in-law is also a problem in Chinese families. (Xiangsheng)

I'm a Mother-in-Law

I am a young mother-in-law, and I sympathize very much with the misunderstood young daughters-in-law. I think a mother-in-law should have a basic understanding: the son is not property. My upbringing of my son is equal to my parents' upbringing of me. The kindness my parents gave me, I did not fully repay my parents, but repaid it to my next generation. I regard the continuation of the family as the continuation of the life of the whole human being. I think that the sweet love between son and daughter-in-law is reasonable and natural, and there is no need to be jealous. I am getting old, and my responsibility to him (them) is over. Precisely because it is a responsibility, I do not haggle about what I get from my son and daughter-in-law. (Hongguo)
