### National Assembly Opening Only One Day Away; Overall Situation to Become Clear Today

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 13th] With only one day remaining before the National Assembly's opening, the government has shown no sign of further postponement. The overall situation will become clear today. Although the Communist Party has repeatedly stated its decision not to submit a list of candidates, other parties may soon do so. Members of the Youth Party held a meeting on the evening of the 13th to discuss the list of representatives. Li Huang is expected to arrive in Nanjing from Shanghai on the 14th to make a final decision. Zhang Junli has also prepared to submit a list, but it is rumored that the Democratic League is still attempting to exert pressure, making the Democratic League the most challenging case currently. The outcome remains uncertain. Furthermore, it is said that military and political negotiations will not be interrupted during the National Assembly; all parties will continue to meet and discuss matters.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 13th] According to an authoritative source, the Communist Party believes that convening the National Assembly will lead to a complete breakdown. We are unsure of their intention, as convening the National Assembly is in accordance with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. The government is determined to return power to the people and has repeatedly requested all parties to submit their lists of candidates. Unexpectedly, the Communist Party insists on not submitting a list. If they never submit, it implies they intend to prevent the National Assembly from convening. Their motives are unknown.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 13th] The Communist Party Office will hold a press conference on the 14th to explain its attitude towards the current situation.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 13th] Thirteen National Assembly representatives registered on the 13th, including the prominent social figure Qian Xinzhi, who completed the procedures in the afternoon. Others include Huang Jilu, Duanmu Kai, and Ma Qingweng. Only 〇6 representatives have not yet registered, some of whom are in Nanjing but have not yet gone to register, while the rest remain in various provinces and cities. The National Assembly is scheduled to open on the 15th. In recent days, various organizations have held tea parties to welcome the representatives. The capital's party, government, and organization organs held a joint tea party on the 13th to welcome all representatives. The Lixingshe (Moral Endeavor Society) is hosting five hundred National Assembly representatives each evening from the 13th to the 15th to watch the "Meng Meinu" opera.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 13th] Jiang Yuntian and others are expected to arrive in Nanjing on the morning of the 14th. Li Zhuchen, a representative of social notables, arrived in Nanjing on the 12th and visited members of the Democratic League on the 13th. Mo Dehui met with Shao Lizi on the morning of the 13th, and Luo Longji was invited to a banquet by Peter on the afternoon of the 13th. The Democratic League held an internal meeting on the morning of the 13th.

Zhang Junli to Arrive in Nanjing Today; Carrying Principles for Nomination

[Our Dispatch] After arriving in Shanghai from Nanjing, Social Democratic Party leader Zhang Junli immediately convened a meeting of party members in Shanghai to discuss the National Assembly issue and exchange views on overall policy. Meetings continued in the morning and afternoon of the 13th. According to party spokesperson Sun Baoyi, the outcome of the two-day discussions is that the Social Democratic Party will make every effort to submit a list of National Assembly candidates. This is not impossible but still requires considerable conditions. The most important requirement is that the government: (1) proceed in accordance with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference; (2) thoroughly reorganize the government, especially the Executive Yuan. Zhang has prepared to bring these non-negotiable demands to Nanjing and present them to the government authorities. If agreed upon, he can immediately submit the list. Party members unanimously hope that the National Assembly can be postponed until December 1st, during which time they can act in accordance with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. They also hope that Chairman Chiang can meet with Mao Zedong to resolve political issues. Zhang believes that there are signs of compromise on all sides regarding the development of the overall situation and that the future is optimistic. When asked whether the Social Democratic Party's list of National Assembly representatives would be submitted simultaneously with the Democratic League and other parties, he said: Our party's quota for National Assembly representatives has been allocated 40 seats from the Democratic League's total of 120 seats. We hope to submit the list simultaneously with the Democratic League, but in certain circumstances, we may also submit it independently. According to our sources, the party's list of National Assembly candidates has not yet been finalized. A list was previously drafted, but if a decision is made to submit it, it will likely be re-established, with slight changes to the previously drafted list. Zhang was originally scheduled to take the night train to Nanjing last night but has now changed his plans to fly on the 14th. Jiang Yuntian arrived in Nanjing last night.

[Central News Agency, Shanghai Dispatch] Youth Party leader Li Huang returned to Shanghai from Nanjing on the morning of the 12th. According to sources at the party headquarters: Li's return to Shanghai is purely for personal matters. The Youth Party's attitude towards the current situation must be decided in Nanjing. Rumors that Li returned to Shanghai to convene an important party meeting to discuss submitting a list of National Assembly representatives are completely inaccurate. Li will make a brief stopover in Shanghai before proceeding to Nanjing.

### Reports of Attacking Yan'an Completely Inaccurate; National Assembly Definitely Will Not Be Postponed Again; Minister Peng Speaks at Press Conference

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 13th] The Ministry of Information held a tea party at 3:30 p.m. on the 13th in the National Assembly Hall's representatives' lounge, inviting over a hundred Chinese and foreign journalists attending the conference. Minister Peng delivered a speech, welcoming journalists from various regions and expressing his hope for successful reporting. He also answered questions from reporters.

Question: Have various parties submitted their lists of representatives? If not, which parties are expected to submit?

Answer: As of now, we have not received any lists from any parties. Within 36 hours, it will become clear which parties will submit and which will not.

Question: Is there a possibility of the National Assembly being postponed again?

Answer: "No."

Question: If the Communist Party and other parties do not submit lists and refuse to participate, will the government still convene the original representatives to pass the constitution?

Answer: Given the answer to the previous question, this question is redundant. However, the government still hopes that all parties can send representatives to attend the National Assembly. Whether the constitution will be passed at this National Assembly is the prerogative of the National Assembly itself.

Question: What is the military situation like after the ceasefire order was issued?

Answer: In the past, the Communist Party demanded an unconditional and comprehensive ceasefire. Now that the government has issued a ceasefire order, the Communist Party has not taken similar action and claims that the government's move is "hypocritical." However, it is a fact that the National Army has strictly complied with the ceasefire order after receiving the order.

Question: Will foreign diplomatic corps be invited to participate in the opening ceremony of the National Assembly?

Answer: "Yes."

Question: As of now, how many representatives have registered?

Answer: Approximately 1,300.

Question: Is the news of the Communist army fiercely besieging Taierzhuang accurate? What are the details?

Answer: The official side has received similar reports, but the details are unknown. We hope that there will be no such extraordinary incidents.

Question: What is the government's reaction to the remarks made by Xu Fulin, Minister of Propaganda of the Social Democratic Party?

Answer: We have read Mr. Xu's remarks in the newspapers and do not intend to comment on them at this time. However, the government sincerely hopes that all parties can participate in the National Assembly and work together to implement constitutional government. We hope that everyone will pay close attention to the developments in the coming days.

Question: It has long been rumored that the Communist Party delegation is about to withdraw to Yan'an. Is this true?

Answer: We have not heard anything about this matter.

Question: It is heard that the Youth Party has decided to submit a list of National Assembly representatives. Is this true?

Answer: You should ask the Youth Party about this matter.

Question: The Chinese Communist Party claims that the National Army intends to attack the outskirts of Yan'an. Is this true?

Answer: The National Army is still far from Yan'an. We don't know if these outskirts refer to the outskirts thousands of miles away?

Question: It is heard that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek wants to meet with Mao Zedong. Is this true? Answer: If Mr. Mao can come to Nanjing, he will be welcomed.

Question: There are frequent disputes in the Constitution Drafting Committee. Can it be completed as scheduled?

Answer: There must be opposing views in any discussion, but there is no problem that this work will be completed before the 15th.

Question: It is heard that there is internal discord in the Third Force. Is this true?

Answer: This should probably be asked of the Third Force.

Question: Has the government obtained guarantees from the Youth Party and the Democratic League regarding the submission of lists of National Assembly representatives?

Answer: The Youth Party and the Democratic League have gone to Shanghai to discuss the matter of nominating candidates. Before they return to Nanjing, the government is not in a position to comment on this.

Question: Will the National Government Committee and the Executive Yuan be reorganized before the National Assembly convenes?

Answer: The National Government Committee can be reorganized at any time. As for the Executive Yuan, it is an executive agency that cannot be suspended for a single day. There is no possibility of reorganization before the conference.

Question: Has an agreement been reached to first decide on the list for the reorganization of the Executive Yuan and then proceed with the reorganization after the National Assembly convenes?

Answer: We know nothing about this.

Question: The Political Consultative Conference resolutions have not yet been fully implemented before the National Assembly is convened. Has the government considered this point?

Answer: The Political Consultative Conference resolutions have not been fully implemented, but these resolutions cover too broad a range of issues, and issues such as military reorganization are beyond the power of the government alone. Even if we delay for another two months, it will be difficult to fully implement them. Finally, Minister Peng asked the reporters to read the map of the military situation when the ceasefire order was issued and in January after the meeting, and said: "We will see you again on the 15th." The meeting adjourned at 4:45.

### CCP Personnel in Nanjing; Partially Withdraw to Yan'an

Rumor of Zhou Enlai Also Leaving Nanjing

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 13th] On the morning of the 12th, 31 members of the Communist Party delegation withdrew from Nanjing and returned to Yan'an on a U.S. military plane. There are now more than 60 people remaining. It is heard that Zhou Enlai has decided to leave Nanjing and return to Yan'an in the near future.

### Sorting out Amendments to the Constitution Draft; Wang Chonghui Explains the Process

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 12th] Wang Chonghui attended the joint meeting of the five committees of the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 13th and explained the process of sorting out the "Draft Amendment to the Fifth-Fifth Constitution Draft," stating: I am one of the members of the Constitution Drafting Committee. Based on the principle of consultation, the committee made three amendments in seven meetings. This revised draft is based on the Fifth-Fifth Constitution Draft as a blueprint and incorporates the opinions of all parties on the constitution draft and the draft proposed by the Constitution Drafting Committee that was not completed. The last two chapters were not resolved by the Constitution Drafting Committee, and the rest were researched or retained. The time to engage in this sorting work was rushed, and omissions are inevitable. However, principles were set during the revision, that is, the fewer changes, the better. At the same time, the President also put forward some instructions. The Fifth-Fifth Constitution Draft has been studied by various parties before and after, and there are many insightful points. Now, in response to the requests of all parties, we have revised it with the legacy of the Premier and incorporating the principles of consultation. The revision can be divided into two parts. One is that it is different from the original draft in principle.

### Comprehensive Talks Still Yield No Results; Yesterday's Discussion Still Centered on the Constitution Draft

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 13th] The informal comprehensive talks were held at Sun Ke's residence at 3:00 p.m. on the 13th, attended by Sun Ke, Shao Lizi, Lei Zhen, Mo Dehui, Miao Jiaming, Chen Qitian, Zeng Qi, Huang Yanpei, Luo Longji, and Zhang Bojun. Communist Party representative Zhou Enlai did not attend, but Dong Biwu went alone. It is heard that the discussion on the 13th still focused on the constitution draft. After the meeting adjourned at 6:00 p.m., Shao Lizi and Lei Zhen went to visit the President to report on the situation and only returned at 10:00 p.m. Lei refused to make any comments. According to members of the Democratic League, today's meeting was very simple and yielded no results. It is not yet known whether a meeting will be held on the 14th, but the Democratic League, the Youth Party, and social notables will still hold a meeting at the Jiaotong Bank on the morning of the 14th and take a group photo. The other part is those that have changed accordingly due to changes in principle. In terms of the latter, the changes are not very many. Then, the revised version was explained item by item. There are not many revisions to Chapter 2, "Rights and Obligations of the People." The purpose of the revised version is the same as the original draft, only the starting point is different. The revision of this chapter is based on the principle of Article 9 of the Political Consultative Conference Constitution Draft Resolution, that is, if the freedom of the people is stipulated by law, it must come from the spirit of protecting freedom and not be aimed at restriction. Therefore, all the words "cannot be restricted except in accordance with the law" in the original constitution draft have been deleted. In other words, we start from the point of protecting freedom and do not emphasize restriction. At the same time, Article 24 "Regarding the freedoms and rights listed above, they shall not be restricted by law except to prevent hindering the freedom of others," so the Legislative Yuan will be somewhat restricted when drafting laws in the future, and cannot casually draft laws regarding the rights of the people. Regarding the National Assembly, the Political Consultative Conference also has a resolution. According to the Fifth-Fifth Constitution Draft, the National Assembly is held once every three years, gathering more than 2,000 people together. What should be done the rest of the time is a real problem. For example, the National Assembly has the power to impeach the president and initiate the constitution, but it cannot impeach the president and initiate the constitution every day. The Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee modified it, and there are detailed regulations on the meeting period and convening of temporary meetings. The organization and functions of the National Assembly are also different from the Fifth-Fifth Constitution Draft. According to the Constitution Drafting Committee, the legislators and supervisors elected from all regions are representatives of the National Assembly. This can create a connection between the Legislative Yuan, the Control Yuan and the National Assembly. Therefore, paragraphs one and two are added to Article 26, and the functions and powers are also different. In addition to electing and impeaching the president and vice president, the National Assembly's functions and powers are to handle and ratify amendments to the constitution. The amendment to the constitution draft proposed by the Legislative Yuan, it is not easy for more than 2,000 people gathered together to deliberate on laws, but it is better to deliberate on principles. This point is the same as the foreign initiation system. After the National Assembly formulates the principles, it will be handed over to the legislative body for completion, but it still has the power of veto. The amendments to the constitution draft proposed by the Legislative Yuan can be re-voted. Chapter 4, "President," is revised based on Article 7 of the Political Consultative Conference Constitution Draft Resolution. Article 44 of the revised draft is the most important. This article stipulates how the president issues emergency orders. The revised draft stipulates that during the recess of the Legislative Yuan, the president may issue emergency orders in accordance with the Emergency Order Law after the resolution of the Executive Council. This point is not found in the Fifth-Fifth Constitution Draft. In other words, the president cannot issue emergency orders during the sessions of the Legislative Yuan. At the same time, the president must issue them in accordance with emergency orders, so the responsibilities are clear. The period for submitting them to the Legislative Yuan for ratification has also been shortened from three months to one month, which is more in line with standards and can avoid unnecessary disputes.

### Zhang Qun to Arrive in Shanghai Today

[Our Dispatch] Sichuan Provincial Chairman Zhang Qun, who went to the United States to recuperate from illness, left the United States and transferred to Tokyo to return to China after being summoned by the authorities. He flew to Shanghai this morning. Zhang will make a brief stopover in Shanghai to informally exchange views with leaders from various parties before proceeding to Nanjing to seek instructions from the President and attend the National Assembly. Social Democratic Party leader Zhang Junli, who was originally scheduled to go to Nanjing last night, decided to postpone his departure temporarily in order to have discussions with Zhang after he arrived in Shanghai.

### Legislative Yuan Holds Joint Committee Meeting; Constitution Draft Put on Hold Due to Procedural Issues; Sun Ke Asks Wu Dingchang to Complete Procedures

[Central News Agency, Nanjing Dispatch on the 13th] The Legislative Yuan held a Constitution Draft Review Meeting on the morning of the 13th, attended by over 60 members including Liu Keshun, Chen Xunyu, Chen Changheng, Situ De, and Jian Guansan, chaired by Lin Bin, Chairman of the Legislative Committee. Wang Chonghui, Secretary-General of the National Defense Supreme Council, and Wu Jingxiong, Minister to the Holy See, were both present. Wang explained the revision process and elaborated on the added articles, lasting for eighty minutes. Wu then made supplementary explanations, after which both withdrew. The Revised Draft of the Fifth-Fifth Constitution Draft Amendment was based on the unfinished draft of the Political Consultative Conference Constitution Draft Review Committee and was sorted out by Wang Chonghui, Wu Jingxiong, Lei Zhen, and others. The Political Consultative Conference Constitution Drafting Committee will review it again soon to make it even better. At today's meeting, because the case was submitted directly by the President, and according to the law, the case submitted for discussion must be proposed by the Central Standing Committee or the National Defense Committee, and because there were questions about legislative procedure, the majority of the members believed that it should not be submitted for discussion. When it was decided to adjourn the meeting for a while and report the matter to President Sun for handling, the meeting adjourned at 11:25.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 13th] After the Legislative Yuan Joint Review Committee meeting on the morning of the 13th, Chairman Lin Bin immediately went to visit Sun Ke to report on the situation of the Review Committee. Sun immediately telegraphed Wu Wenzhang of the National Government to complete the procedures regarding the completion of the procedures, but as to whether the amendment should be reviewed, he believed that the Legislative Yuan was responsible to the central government and could not insist on dissent. He planned to separately meet with each member to give advice. The joint meeting may be reopened on the 16th in order to complete the review of the case and submit it to the National Assembly for discussion.

### At the Joint Review Committee of the Five Committees of the Legislative Yuan

— Our Reporter Ning Yuan

After the National Assembly Opening was postponed, the various parties and social notables were considering whether to submit lists and attend the meeting, and the constitution draft, which was about to be submitted to the General Assembly for discussion, was also stranded in the Legislative Yuan. The difficulties of the current situation have reached their climax at this time.

On the 11th of this month, based on President Chiang's Jia (November 9th) National Government Jiaojing No. 798〇 Tongdai Telegram, the Legislative Yuan convened a temporary meeting to discuss the Fifth-Fifth Constitution Draft Amendment drafted by Sun Ke and four other government members of the Constitution Drafting Committee. On the same day, member Liu Xun first raised an objection. In the end, Chairman Sun, because he was discussing procedural issues at the time, stopped his speech, and white-haired old member Liu declared his withdrawal. The atmosphere at the meeting that day was very tense, and many people expressed silent sympathy. Finally, a bomb that resonated with Liu was detonated at the Joint Review Committee meeting of the Five Committees on the 13th.

After Wang Liangchou and Wu Jingxiong explained the process of revision, the first to launch an attack was member Di Junwu. Member Di first spoke on legislative procedures, believing that the Legislative Yuan could only discuss proposals generated in three ways: first, resolutions of the Central Standing Committee; second, resolutions of the Central Political Council, that is, the National Defense Supreme Council, which now exercises its functions; and third, proposals from the legislators themselves. The constitution draft amendment sent down by the National Government on behalf of the government did not belong to any of the three generated above. Member Di believed that this was an unprecedented precedent in the Legislative Yuan. If the issues under discussion were not important, that would be fine, but now we are discussing the national law of the century, and if we accept the discussion rashly, we will be blamed by people for thousands of years to come. Secondly, regarding the content issues, the revision principles of all the amendments are based on the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, but they clearly conflict with the resolutions of the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee. The government still belongs to the Kuomintang's command of the party, and we can only accept the instructions of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee and cannot be bound by the Political Consultative Conference, which has no legal basis. If we do not accept the resolutions of the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee, we are violating our duties. His conclusion was that based on these two premises, whether we can accept the revised draft for review is a matter worthy of consideration by this reporter.

After Member Di's impassioned speech, Member Chen Haicheng also raised similar accusations. Member Chen pointed out three points: first, should the opinions of the Political Consultative Conference and the Comprehensive Group be accepted? Second, should the hospital be bound by the resolutions of the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee? Third, if the revised draft violates the legacy of the Founding Father of the Republic of China, should the hospital correct it?

At this time, Chairman Lin Bin repeatedly spoke, asking everyone to first raise any questions and ask the attending Mr. Wang Liangchou and Mr. Wu Jingxiong to answer, and to delay the discussion of the content and principles. At this time, Mongolian member Qi Zhihou stood up again, believing that it should first be decided whether the draft should be accepted for discussion. If it is not discussed, there is no need to raise questions. Member Chen Changxin had just said two sentences on the principle issues when he was shouted down from behind his seat. Under this situation, Mr. Wang Liangchou and Mr. Wu Jingxiong had no choice but to withdraw first.

At this time, there was another episode. Suiyuan member Wu Yunpeng stood up and said that several Mongolian representatives had come to the hospital to visit and had opinions on the constitution draft. He hoped to give them a chance to speak. Then someone interrupted him and said that since we are discussing the constitution draft today, there is no need to ask them to speak here. Wu Yunpeng believed that since they had come from afar, the hospital should at least send someone to talk to them. In a hurry, the chairman designated members Di and Zhang Fengjiu to meet with them.

The question was asked again about the constitution draft. Everyone argued for a while. Several people shouted to adjourn the meeting and looked like they were about to leave, and the order was very chaotic. At this time, Member Li Qingchen spoke, saying that whether we discuss it or not, the order of the meeting must be maintained, otherwise it will almost be a drama.

Everyone calmed down.

Chairman Lin Bin stood up to report that, according to him: President Sun had talked with several legislators yesterday (the 12th) afternoon, reporting the progress of the revision of the constitution draft and explaining the situation of the negotiations in recent days. The president's view is that except for the Chinese Communist Party, which has not yet expressed an opinion that it can participate, other parties seem to be preparing to attend, so the Comprehensive Group is now discussing the unfinished constitution draft amendment, and perhaps it will propose the entire amendment in the next few days. If we discuss this unfinished amendment now, we may have to reorganize it again at that time. Therefore, Lin advocated that the Review Committee be temporarily postponed until it is studied again after the National Assembly opens on the 15th.

Member He Sui supplemented the chairman's opinion, saying that since the constitution draft amendment sent by President Chiang's telegram did not comply with the legal procedures, we can complete this procedure while we wait.

Finally, the chairman announced the adjournment of the meeting and stated that the situation discussed today would be reported to President Sun.

After the meeting, President Sun Changran was the first to receive the news, followed by Minister Wu Dingchang, and finally Secretary-General Wu of the Central Party Department. Everyone was discussing how to complete the legal procedures separately. The Civil Service Department may transfer the case to the Central Secretariat, and the Central Secretariat should of course immediately convene a meeting of the Central Standing Committee, but the difficult problem encountered by the Central Standing Committee is whether it can change the resolution of the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee. If it is to be completely legal, the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee must be convened, but the National Assembly will open the day after tomorrow, and there is no time to convene the Plenary Session again. The final solution to the problem depends on the President's right of adjudication. Therefore, the hardworking and conscientious leader of the Kuomintang has to personally bear this heavy responsibility again.

The so-called procedural problem, although seemingly difficult, is ultimately easy to solve. As for the content problem, it is really a fundamental problem. Undoubtedly, this amendment is very different from Mr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy. If the country can achieve long-term stability and peace from now on, then Mr. Sun Yat-sen's followers will only accept it with determination. The problem is that even if they accept this unwilling amendment, the Communists and members of various parties will not necessarily all attend the National Assembly. Therefore, some people believe that since this is the case, why should the Kuomintang honestly accept this amendment first? It is better to wait for a while and calculate that when the parties have the sincerity to participate in the National Assembly, it will not be too late to consider its amendments. The reason why Lin Bin wanted to wait until the opening day of the National Assembly to propose it for discussion was actually for this reason.

### Mr. Gu Weijun Delivers a Speech: The Future of Sino-U.S. Trade is Bright, Urging the U.S. Business Community Not to Be Impatient

[Central News Agency, New York, 12th Dispatch from United Press] Gu Weijun, the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, recently addressed the National Foreign Trade Convention, urging the U.S. business community not to be discouraged by the temporary inability to fully restore Sino-U.S. trade, nor to be impatient. Mr. Gu stated: "The unstable situation in China is merely an inevitable stage in the process of national unification. This unification is a necessary condition for the development of trade and other constructive endeavors. Once the country achieves unification, stability will naturally follow, and political, economic, and social reforms and construction will be able to proceed and advance towards success. The Chinese government is currently working to improve transportation for imports and within the interior. Furthermore, it is promoting land reform. China's current economic situation can be roughly compared to that of the United States after the Civil War. The potential for trade with the United States is truly limitless, and the long-term outlook is also very broad. The first step in China's industrialization plan is to raise living standards, and the second step is to increase purchasing power. This will ultimately greatly increase China's demand for American products, such as telephones, radios, refrigerators, vacuum cleaners, etc. In terms of the balance of payments in Sino-U.S. trade, China has historically been a country with an import surplus. Therefore, we must industrialize our country, increase production, and increase exports, so that paying for imports will be easier. "Mr. Gu continued: "The most enlightened and liberal policy embodied in the U.S.-China Treaty of Commerce gives us reason to predict the future of trade relations between the two countries with legitimate speculation and confidence. An important factor in the new treaty for developing trade in China with the U.S. is that all of Chinese territory is open to American merchants. The basic principle of the treaty is equality and reciprocity. The American people can always rely on the goodwill of the Chinese people. There is a constant open door of friendship between the two peoples, and Sino-U.S. trade aids each other's needs. Some American merchants are unable to compete with Chinese exporters, such as pig bristles, certain minerals, raw silk, and tea, as these are not products of the United States. Chinese embroidery, lace, and linen weaving require high skills and take a long time to produce, and it is impossible to produce them with the high labor costs in the United States. However, on the other hand, American steel, iron, lumber, wheat, flour, and cotton textiles cannot be matched by Chinese production." Mr. Gu also stated that automobiles, railways, and ships can only gain a limited market in China.

### Fan Xuande Delivers a Speech: Discussing the "No-Investment Policy"

Hoping that the National Assembly of Our Country Can Reach a Wise Agreement

[United Press, New York, 12th Dispatch] Fan Xuande, Director of the Far East Division of the State Department, said in a speech at the Foreign Trade Association today that China's foreign exchange and foreign trade regulations are only a temporary tranquilizer. The United States government and private sector should not invest in countries where there is widespread corruption among officials, merchants cheat each other, and the government wastes resources on excessive armaments. Fan Xuande also listed the countries involved in this "no-investment policy," such as those where civil wars have already occurred or are about to occur, those where government monopolies exclude American merchants, and those where anti-democratic elements control the government. He made every effort to avoid naming these countries. Earlier, in his speech, Fan Xuande stated: "The State Department hopes that China can avoid the disaster of continued internal conflict, and hopes that the future National Assembly can reach a wise agreement. The stability and recovery of the Chinese economy is being hindered by its unfortunate political and military situation. The current foreign exchange and foreign trade regulations are only sufficient to address the immediate crisis."

### Severe Cold in the Former Capital

### The UNRRA Far East Regional Committee: Yan Huiqing Re-Elected as Chairman, Li Zhuomin and the Dutch Representative as Vice-Chairmen

[Report from This Newspaper] The UNRRA Far East Regional Committee held a meeting at the Bank of China Building yesterday morning from 9:30 a.m. Attendees included representatives from eight countries: China, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, France, Australia, India, and the Netherlands. The committee first held an informal meeting to discuss the issue of who would succeed Chairman Jiang Tingfu after his resignation. After unanimous selection, Dr. Yan Huiqing was re-elected as chairman, and Dr. Li Zhuomin, Deputy Director of the Executive Yuan, and Dutch representative Stark were elected as vice-chairmen. The list of representatives attending was: Yan Huiqing and Li Zhuomin from China; Gabriel Cluett from the United States; Hall from Australia and New Zealand; Stanley and Ms. Hender from the United Kingdom; Bletian from France; Stark from the Netherlands; Xibannas from the Soviet Union; Hanson from India; and General Egerton, UNRRA representative in China.

Huo Baoshu Delivers a Speech

During the meeting, Dr. Yan Huiqing specially introduced Huo Baoshu, Director-General of the Executive Yuan, to everyone to express his welcome. Director Huo then stood up to express his thanks and said: "I deeply admire all the representatives for their past efforts and contributions to the post-war relief work in the Far East. I now assure you that I will do my best within the scope of my duties to assist in the mission entrusted to you by the UNRRA General Assembly. However, I firmly believe that no one in this committee hopes that the Far East Regional Committee will develop into a judging body, and further inquire into UNRRA's administrative work in the Far East or interfere with the purely administrative issues of the recipient countries. Recently, the Executive Yuan's efforts to clear materials from the port of Shanghai have promoted the resumption of UNRRA shipments to China. Director-General La Guardia has announced the full resumption of shipments to China, and materials will be shipped as soon as the US maritime workers' strike is resolved. However, on the other hand, the scope of the UNRRA supply plan has not been determined, the exact dates and contents of the shipments have not been determined, and the working period of UNRRA technical experts in China has not been determined, which affects the work of the Executive Yuan. I hope that this committee will seriously discuss and resolve these issues. More than half of the total amount of materials that UNRRA plans to supply to China has yet to be shipped to China. I firmly believe that the next UNRRA General Assembly will be able to give us a guarantee that UNRRA will not end before it has completed its work, because without this guarantee, the work cannot be carried out smoothly. Therefore, I sincerely hope that this committee will make a clear and firm recommendation to the next UNRRA General Assembly."

After Director Huo finished his speech, the representatives of various countries began to discuss various issues. Dr. Yan also read out the General Assembly resolution, unanimously expressing respect for Jiang Tingfu and expressing admiration and enthusiasm for his contributions to the Executive Yuan over the past six months.

Overview of Refugee Repatriation

The General Assembly discussed the issue of refugee repatriation, and Dr. Shabao reported on the progress of the work. To date, the committee has repatriated 1,900 overseas Chinese to Myanmar and 918 to Singapore. If the Myanmar government approves, another 12,000 overseas Chinese will be repatriated, and by the end of June next year, 33,000 overseas Chinese will be repatriated to various places. In addition to the US$300,000 already approved by UNRRA, another US$1.9 million has been requested for the repatriation of refugees from various countries. With the approval of the authorities, 2,000 Austrian refugees will be repatriated from China. However, due to the difficult economic situation in Germany, it is not easy to repatriate German nationals for the time being. Several Czech and Yugoslav nationals are currently being repatriated each month, and reports have been received from Italy that ships have been dispatched to China to pick up Italian nationals. All of them can be transported by the end of December.

Other issues, such as UNRRA's relief medical supplies to China, cotton spinning, industry, and other relief supplies, will be reserved for discussion in the subcommittees or at today's meeting.

The committee held a subcommittee meeting yesterday afternoon, and the General Assembly will continue to meet at 9:30 a.m. today.

### Impeachment of Sheng Shicai: Investigation Established, Moved to Disciplinary Action; Criminal Portion Transferred to the Court

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th Dispatch] The Xinjiang Provincial Provisional Assembly and the general public have repeatedly accused Sheng Shicai, the former chairman of the province, of violating laws and disciplines, being brutal and greedy, and committing various crimes during his tenure.

The criminal portion was sent to the court for investigation and trial in accordance with the law.

### Amidst the National Army's Observance of the Ceasefire Order, Yan'an Convenes a Mobilization Meeting; Communist Troops in Northeast and Shandong Continue to Attack

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th Dispatch] In order to seek peaceful unification, the government took the initiative to issue a ceasefire order, which came into effect at noon on the 11th. However, the Communist Party has not yet indicated that it will cease operations and is preparing to launch a major war. According to Yan'an Broadcasting on the 12th, the Central Committee of the Communist Party convened a so-called mobilization meeting of cadres to defend the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and Yan'an. More than a thousand cadres from all sides attended. Zhu De, Peng Dehuai, and Liu Shaoqi spoke one after another, unanimously calling on everyone to learn combat techniques, such as laying landmines and throwing grenades, in preparation for fighting.

[Report from Beiping, this newspaper, 13th] Zheng Jiemin, the government member of the Military Mediation Department, had not received a reply from the Communist Party regarding the ceasefire memorandum as of the 13th. Cai Wenzhi, Chief of Staff of the Government, told reporters on the 13th: "The executive department's supervision of the ceasefire is unable to do anything because the Communist Party has not adopted a cooperative attitude. It is generally judged that the frozen state of the executive department cannot be changed until the three-person military group in Nanjing reaches an agreement on specific measures for the ceasefire." When asked by reporters whether the Communist army had taken any military action after noon on November 11, Cai replied: "In the areas northwest of Nong'an in the Northeast and Anqiu, Linzi in Shandong, and Yulin in Shaanxi, the Communist army continued to take offensive action."

### Communist Troops Attack Huaide: Battalion Commander Feng Dies in Battle

[Report from Shenyang, this newspaper, 13th] At 3:00 p.m. on the 11th, about 2,000 Communist troops suddenly surrounded Huaide, south of Changchun. Battalion Commander Feng Yongchang led 300 men to resist. After two hours of fierce fighting, the officers and soldiers suffered heavy casualties due to the disparity in numbers. Battalion Commander Feng died in battle. The situation in the city was unclear at dusk. The electrical team transmitted the news here. This is the first unfortunate incident after the issuance of the ceasefire order.

[Report from Xuzhou, this newspaper, 13th] The National Army on the front lines of Erhuai in northern Jiangsu, southern Shandong, and western Shandong all complied with the order to stop advancing by noon on the 11th. However, on the evening of the 11th, the Communist army in southern Shandong simultaneously launched a large-scale attack on Guocun and Dongxi Zouwuwu and other places on the Taizao branch line and the Linzao branch line. The Shan Jialin Bridge was blown up. After a fierce battle until the morning of the 12th, the Communist army was repelled, but the National Army did not pursue them. However, the government's ceasefire order was sent to the Communist side to urge them to pay attention to their responsibilities.

### Compiling Constitutional Draft Amendments: Wang Chonghui Explains the Process

Continued from Page One

Chapter 5, which stipulates the executive branch, is the focus of attention from all parties. This section is drafted based on Article 6 of the Political Consultative Conference. However, the second paragraph of that article states that if the Legislative Yuan expresses a vote of no confidence in the Executive Yuan as a whole, the Executive Yuan may either resign or request the President to dissolve the Legislative Yuan. This point raised great doubts at the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee, as it was far from Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings. The Drafting Committee deleted this paragraph. This clause caused the most controversy. At the same time, there was much discussion outside about the provisions of Article 56, which stipulate that the Executive Yuan is responsible to the Legislative Yuan. In fact, this provision does not necessarily mean that it is a presidential system or a cabinet system, because there is no power of no confidence and the Executive Yuan has no power to dissolve it, so it is different from the cabinet systems of England and France. At the same time, there is also the provision that "when the Legislative Yuan maintains its original resolution upon reconsideration, the head of the Executive Yuan shall accept or resign." This is something that is not available in the United States, which adopts a presidential system, and it is also superior to the presidential system. In addition, after the president "resigns", the president can select a new head of the Executive Yuan to consult with the Legislative Yuan, so that there is more room for maneuver, and the president can also avoid directly conflicting with the Legislative Yuan. In the United States, political affairs are often delayed due to conflicts between the president and Congress, and the revised draft has a provision that "two-thirds of the members of the Legislative Yuan maintain their original resolution." There is room for consultation between the two parties, and I hope that all parties can calmly discuss it and compare it with the presidential cabinet system of foreign countries.

Chapter 6, Legislative Branch, is revised based on Article 2 of the Government Agreement. Zhang Junmai strongly argued against Article 3, which states that "The Legislative Yuan shall not propose to increase expenditures on budget proposals submitted by the Executive Yuan." The reason for this provision is that if the Legislative Yuan can propose to increase the budget, then the legislators elected by the provinces and cities can all propose increases and exchange voting rights, making it difficult for the Executive Yuan. Therefore, it is stipulated that expenditures cannot be increased. Articles 83 in the Judiciary and Examination branches stipulate that judges must be independent of parties and conduct trials independently based on the law. However, Article 92 stipulates that members of the Examination Yuan must be independent of parties. This is an omission. The powers of the Control Yuan include an additional power of "consent." Articles 95 and 96 are also different from the original draft constitution.

The chapter on the powers of the central and local governments is drafted based on Article 2 of Article 8 of the Political Consultative Conference. The powers of the two are divided in detail, and regulations are made in accordance with the principle of balanced power, and there is room for flexibility. Regarding judicial, financial, and economic matters, which originally belonged to the local government, the highest authorities later changed them to belong to the central government. If there is a dispute over the powers of the central and local governments, it will be resolved by the Legislative Yuan in accordance with the provisions of Article 110. This is also a new approach. Regarding the issue of provincial constitutions, the Political Consultative Conference stipulated that "provinces may formulate provincial constitutions." Later, after being revised by the Constitutional Draft Review Committee, it was changed to "provinces may formulate self-government laws." There was much debate over the issue of whether provincial self-government laws should be approved by the central government. The provisions of Article 113 state that "If the Judicial Yuan believes that there is a violation of the constitution, it shall declare the constitutional provisions invalid" and must be sent to the Judicial Yuan within one month after formulation, so it can be implemented. This is a compromise.

Wu Jingxiong's Explanation

[Report from Nanjing, this newspaper, 13th] Wu Jingxiong explained the process of compiling the draft "Revised Draft of the Fifth-Fifth Constitutional Draft" at a joint meeting of the Fifth Committee of the Legislative Yuan on the 13th. He said that rumors that the principles of the Political Consultative Conference Constitution had been changed were launched by the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee, which is clearly inconsistent with the facts. The Constitutional Draft Review Committee met before the Second Plenary Session was convened. When the Constitutional Draft Review Committee met, we proposed that some resolutions should be revised, and there were disputes at that time. For example, on the first point, according to the Political Consultative Conference resolution, the National Assembly was an invisible National Assembly. The government representatives argued based on scholarship and logic. We cannot be considered to have broken faith because of this. Moreover, the Political Consultative Conference decided at that time to organize a Constitutional Draft Review Committee, which left a margin for discussion on the issue of the constitution. If there were good suggestions on the constitution from all parties, they could be put forward. We provided opinions to the Constitutional Draft Review Committee based on this spirit, hoping to revise it. Second, according to the provisions of the second paragraph of Article 6 of the Fifth Resolution of the Political Consultative Conference, "If the Legislative Yuan expresses a vote of no confidence in the Executive Yuan as a whole, the Executive Yuan may either resign or request the President to dissolve the Legislative Yuan, but the same head of the Executive Yuan may not request to dissolve the Legislative Yuan again." This article is tantamount to establishing a complete cabinet system, which is contrary to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings. When our representatives participated in the Constitutional Draft Review Committee, they believed that it should be revised. Finally, regarding the issue of provincial constitutions, we also strongly argued in the Constitutional Draft Review Committee and decided to change it to provincial self-government law. All of the above are sufficient to prove that we had strongly argued before the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee was convened, and it was not formally proposed after the Second Plenary Session. This point should be stated. The above three points have been agreed upon in the Constitutional Draft Review Committee, and this compilation is partially based on the above three principles for revision.

### Editorial: Today is the Last Day!

The National Assembly was postponed for three days, and two days have already passed. Only today, the last day, remains. The current situation has reached its peak today, and the urgency of the moment is like a hair's breadth. The people across the country are looking towards Nanjing, hoping for good news to arrive at every moment. However, what we see in the newspapers is either that a portion of the CCP delegation has already flown back to Yan'an on American planes, or that Yan'an has issued a general mobilization order, preparing for counter-attacks on all fronts. This is completely contrary to what our people hope for. The CCP's actions are truly disappointing.

Recalling that after the enemy surrendered last year, Mr. Mao Zedong responded to Chairman Chiang's invitation to meet in Chongqing, and the CCP representatives chanted slogans of peace and democracy. At that time, it seemed very pleasant to our simple-minded people. Because after the victory of the war of resistance, what our people longed for day and night was peace and democracy. Thereafter, peace talks experienced twists and turns. Until recently, although we felt the CCP's attitude was unreasonable, we still did not express despair, and ultimately believed that the CCP would have a day of sudden realization. Even this newspaper, standing on the side of the people, repeatedly wrote articles advising the CCP to prioritize the country, lay down its butcher knives, and achieve enlightenment. At this moment, a thorough awakening would still not be too late. However, we have already exhausted our earnest words and advice. Lately, we have almost nothing to say. We only feel that the CCP's attitude is truly incomprehensible.

The CCP both desires peace and has requested that the government immediately cease fire. However, when the government issued a ceasefire order, the CCP not only did not issue a ceasefire order itself, but instead said that it was a unilateral decision and expressed its disagreement. How can such far-fetched arguments be convincing! Furthermore, the CCP repeatedly claims to want democracy, but when the government decided to convene the National Assembly to return power to the people and implement constitutional government, the CCP not only did not welcome it, but instead tried every possible means to obstruct it, causing the National Assembly to be repeatedly postponed. Even on the eve of the opening, it was decided to postpone it for another three days. Logically, the CCP should also participate, but the CCP is still not satisfied and insists on preventing the National Assembly from convening. Time is passing! In the blink of an eye, two days have passed, and have been missed. Only today, the last day, remains, but the CCP's attitude not only shows no sign of sudden awakening, but has instead intensified and become even more stubborn. Zhou Enlai not only threatened the government by saying that "the government should bear the responsibility for the breakdown of peace talks," but also threatened our people by having the CCP delegation prepare to return to Yan'an. Since the CCP wants democracy, what reason can it have to oppose the Kuomintang returning power to the people? This truly perplexes us greatly! As for the three conditions proposed by Zhou Enlai for the CCP to participate in the National Assembly, there is also really no reason to speak of. It is not worth arguing about. According to reports, these three conditions are: (1) The government must first be reorganized; (2) The draft constitution decided by the informal talks of the Political Consultative Conference's comprehensive group must be guaranteed to be passed by the National Assembly; (3) The list of CCP delegates participating in the National Assembly must be submitted to the reorganized government.

The process of the peace talks, in the eyes of our people, is as clear as day and does not need to be repeated. The delay in the government's reorganization was also caused by the CCP's obstruction, needless to say. As for the draft constitution, the Three Principles of the People are the principles unanimously believed in by the people of the country, and the CCP also recognizes the Three Principles of the People as the supreme principle for nation-building. If a constitution is drafted in accordance with the Three Principles of the People, it will surely be passed by the National Assembly without a doubt. There is really no need for guarantees.

In short, we have always respected the CCP's position in domestic politics, and we still hope that the CCP can plan for its own future and not abandon itself. What the CCP has expressed in recent days is no different from abandoning itself to the people of the country. We truly feel sorry for the CCP. Today is the last day, and we are still here hoping for the CCP's sudden awakening!

### Review of the Trusteeship System

The United Nations General Assembly began discussing the issue of colonial trusteeship on the fourth of this month. Because the United Nations Charter does not provide clear and practical regulations for the trusteeship system, the First United Nations General Assembly, which was held in London, did not reach any agreement on this thorny issue. As a result, the representatives of various countries, especially the representatives of the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States, still have not made any progress in interpreting what constitutes "directly concerned states." However, the issue of colonial trusteeship is not only related to the future destiny of tens of millions of people, but also closely related to world peace. Therefore, the United Nations General Assembly will continue to discuss this issue in the next few days, so that the United Nations organization can formally establish a Trusteeship Council during the Second General Assembly. Britain and the United States have already put forward a proposal on this issue, and although the Soviet Union has expressed its dissent, it is expected to be passed by the United Nations General Assembly as a result of the British and American representatives' contacts with other countries' representatives. Therefore, the Trusteeship Council may soon be formally established.

In the era of capitalist imperialism, colonies have always been the object of contention for various countries. They even resorted to arms in order to seize colonies, leading to devastating wars. The First World War can indeed be regarded as a war in which various capitalist imperialist powers fought for colonies, and the Second World War was also a war of the same nature. Therefore, far-sighted politicians and diplomats at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919 painstakingly sought a reasonable solution to the colonial issue, and the League of Nations Mandate System came into being. The mandate system itself is theoretically an ideal system, but in practice, it not only failed to realize the ideal of the mandate system, but the mandated territories became colonies in disguise. On the contrary, it made the colonial issue even more complicated. After the Second World War, politicians and diplomats of various countries all felt that the mandate system had to be abolished and that another new system should be created to replace it. The trusteeship system was proposed at the San Francisco Conference. At that time, due to the urgency of time, it was not possible to discuss it at length, and only a few principles were stipulated. A precise definition of "directly concerned states" was not given. In January of this year, when the United Nations General Assembly held its first meeting in London, the issue of trusteeship became a pending issue in the international community, once again because of differences of opinion among various countries.

After the United Nations General Assembly opened in New York this time, representatives of various countries requested that the issue of trusteeship be discussed, and it began to be discussed on the fourth of this month. First, representatives of various countries delivered speeches one after another. In the speeches of various people, it was discovered that the interpretations of the so-called "directly concerned states" by various countries were different. After discussing this for a week, no clue was obtained. The key still lies in the fact that the views of the Soviet Union and the United States and Britain are diametrically opposed. The United States has also submitted a draft trusteeship agreement to the Trusteeship Committee for the islands in the Pacific that were previously代 by Japan. In principle, it also advocates that the islands in the Pacific that were previously代 by Japan should be completely transferred to the United Nations trusteeship; however, the United States still requests to retain its management rights. This is no different from the United States requesting sole trusteeship. At the same time, the United States is planning to establish military bases on these islands, which will naturally arouse the suspicion of the Soviet Union. Therefore, the Soviet representative to the United Nations General Assembly, Novikov, first expressed his dissent, and the countries of the Slavic bloc, who followed the Soviet Union's lead, also echoed it. It is said that the Soviet Union has a different interpretation of "directly concerned states." Therefore, the Soviet representative proposed that "after the Trusteeship Council is established, when discussing any trusteeship 恊 定 案 proposed by any country, the five countries of China, Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union will automatically become "directly concerned" and have the right to veto the draft agreement. It is naturally impossible for Britain and the United States to agree with the Soviet Union's view. If things are done according to the Soviet Union's proposal, the draft trusteeship agreement proposed by the United States will never be approved by the Trusteeship Council. Therefore, on the eleventh, the United States again notified all member states of the Trusteeship Committee, formally stating that if the Trusteeship Committee cannot agree with the proposal put forward by the United States, then the United States will retain what has already become a fact, that is, permanently control the islands in the Pacific that were previously代 by Japan, such as the Marshall Islands, the Caroline Islands, and the Mariana Islands. When the Trusteeship Committee met on the eleventh, the Soviet representative Novikov again made a long speech, criticizing the draft trusteeship agreements proposed by Britain, the United States, France, Australia, Belgium, and the South African Federation one by one, and denounced them as fundamentally contrary to the principles revealed in the United Nations Charter. In this way, in the United Nations General Assembly, the rift caused by the different views of the Soviet Union and the United States and Britain on the issue of trusteeship became even more blatant. Although the Soviet representative also expressed his hope that the Trusteeship Council could be established as soon as possible, his actions are no different from obstructing the establishment of the Trusteeship Council, just as the American representative Dulles said: "Although the Soviet Union is constantly complaining that the Trusteeship Council has not yet been established, its actions always hinder the establishment of the Trusteeship Council."

As for our country's attitude towards the trusteeship issue, our country's representative Liu 也 also made a speech at the United Nations General Assembly, advocating the early establishment of the Trusteeship Council, and said: "We must not make the trusteeship system a 分 制, let alone make it a paper document; and we should make the tens of millions of people now get comfort, knowing that the United Nations organization is about to take steps to ensure their future progress and freedom." I remember that in January of this year, when the United Nations General Assembly held a meeting in London to discuss the trusteeship issue, our country's representative Dr. Gu Weijun clearly expressed our country's 本 立 塲 on this issue. He said: "The trusteeship system is a major advancement of the mandate system, and tens of millions of people will benefit from it. The trusteeship system may accelerate the political, economic, social, and educational development of the people in the mandated territories, so that they can establish autonomous governments and fulfill their aspirations for independence and autonomy, so that they can be realized as soon as possible." Therefore, we deeply hope that the Trusteeship Council can be established as soon as possible, and we hope that the politicians and diplomats of all countries can be farsighted and abandon selfish and self-interested ideas. On the one hand, they should not use the trusteeship system to pursue the interests of one country; on the other hand, they should not obstruct it, making it impossible for the Trusteeship Council to be established, seeking only temporary pleasure, but should think more about the tens of millions of people, so that they can achieve the ultimate goal of autonomy and independence as soon as possible; at the same time, the colonial issue should no longer be a source of war.

### Bandits in Hongze Lake to be Eliminated; Zhejiang Province Schedules Winter Defense to Begin Next Month

[This Newspaper Hangzhou Thirteenth] The Zhejiang Provincial Government decided to implement winter defense from December 1st to the end of February next year. It has formulated a general plan and submitted it to the Security Command for detailed measures, which will be handled jointly with the Gendarmerie Regiment and the Police Bureau.

[This Newspaper Huaiyin News] Hongze Lake, located in the middle of Jiangsu and Anhui provinces, is of great importance to the water conservancy of the Huaibao area. This time, when the Communist army retreated, it decided to destroy the dikes and harm the people. Everything below Huaiyin has become a swamp, and the western border of Huaian is still a vast expanse of water. The disaster is severe, and the lake surface is vast, with bandits lurking. It has always been a place to hide dirt and harbor filth. Bandits take advantage of the dense reeds to hide large quantities of food, weapons, and ammunition, and seize the opportunity to cause trouble. It is a major concern for the two provinces. The government is now actively preparing to build net boats and arm itself for self-defense in order to permanently eliminate the bandit problem.

[This Newspaper Zhehua News] The Chaoxian County Government, because bandits often appear in various villages and towns in the Zhe district, disturbing the neighborhood, specially dispatched Chen, the captain of the county self-defense team, and Ji Min, to lead the first squadron stationed in Zhe, and set off to clear and suppress the Donghuangshan area.

### Jiangsu Province Second District Finance Review Meeting; Counties Report Difficulties; Director Dong Explains Response Policies

[This Newspaper Suzhou Thirteenth] The Finance Business Review Meeting of the Counties in the Second District of Jiangsu Province opened in Suzhou at eight o'clock on the morning of the thirteenth. The attendees included Dong Zhe, Director of the Provincial Finance Department, Xu Baoguang, Commissioner of the Second District, Shen Chenglong, Director of Inspection of the Finance Department, and more than thirty people including the county magistrates, finance section chiefs, revenue office chiefs, and treasury directors of the eight counties.

He also clarified that in the future, in addition to the five autonomous donations,

### News Telegraph Items

Hangzhou Reporters Telegraph Request to Reduce

[This Newspaper Hangzhou News] The colleagues of the Zhejiang Provincial Association of Out-of-Town Reporters, believing that the price of electricity has been adjusted this time, and the price of news telegrams has also increased tenfold, which has greatly affected news reporting, unanimously decided to telegraph to news colleagues across the country to respond to the request to the Ministry of Communications to readjust the price of news telegrams in order to maintain the development of the news industry. In addition to taxes, the rate of the field tax has increased by 51 percent, and the rate of public grain has increased by 15 percent. Moreover, there are all of the deed tax and 50 percent of the business tax, which is already fully generous. Therefore, the heads of various counties and cities should, according to the urgency of local needs, strive to carry out construction projects in order of priority. At about nine o'clock, the reports on the financial, tax, and treasury conditions of the counties began and stopped at twelve o'clock for rest. In the afternoon, the reports continued at two o'clock and ended at about four o'clock. The conference announced a fifteen-minute break. The reporter of this newspaper synthesized the contents of the reports from the eight counties, most of which stated that the budget revenue and expenditure could not be balanced, resulting in the fact that special taxes could not be stopped, such as in Wujiang County. This issue was raised to Gu Junnan, the section chief of the Finance Department, who said that the Finance Department would strictly stop such situations. At 4:30, the meeting continued, and Director Dong specifically gave a general explanation on the various difficult issues raised by the counties, which are described separately as follows:

(1) The problem of unbalanced budget revenue and expenditure should not exist in the second district of Jiangsu Province, where the essence of Jiangsu is concentrated. If it does, it is only a temporary phenomenon when there is not enough food available before the harvest. The Finance Department can pre-borrow in-kind land tax payments from the Ministry of Food to offset the loans. There are about 5 billion yuan, which will be divided equally among the counties and cities for emergency use. However, the preparation of the next year's budget must be based on income and expenditure, and under the principles of management, education, health, and development, the focus of work must be determined and a percentage must be set to achieve a balance.

(2) The issue of temporary fees for emergency payments, if there is accidentally a shortfall, can be borrowed from the treasury. The province will separately set the flexible scale of the reserve funds for the counties and cities. As for the expenses for suppressing bandits in Jiangnan, if they are within the range of 2 million to 4 million yuan, they can be used first and then reported to the province for approval.

(3) The issue of rural and township autonomy funds, in the past, there were no funds allocated for subsidies, resulting in local fundraising, which became one of the hardships of people's lives. Recently, the province has stipulated that 1% of the deed price should be attached to the deed tax as a supervision fee for rural towns, and 70% of this income should be transferred to the original rural town expenses, and the remaining 30% should be coordinated by the county to allocate funds to remote rural towns. Therefore, local apportionment is absolutely not allowed in the future. However, if there are necessary construction projects in the area, the expenses will be proposed and approved by the town people's representatives congress and included in the county budget, and then it will be temporarily allowed to raise funds.

(4) The issue of insufficient county and city office space will be coordinated and adjusted by the province.

(5) The issue of insufficient financial and tax personnel in counties and cities can be appropriately supplemented, but the total expenses should not exceed 15% of the tax revenue in principle.

(6) The county and city revenue offices should be closely linked to the land registry offices. People must first obtain a new deed when handling property registration before they can issue ownership certificates at the price. The meeting adjourned temporarily at six o'clock. On the fourteenth, the treasury system, public funds and properties, and the organization of township production will be reviewed all day.

### Military Vehicle Carrying Passengers Speeding; Overturns into a Ditch on the Side of the Road

[This Newspaper Ding News] At about 7:00 p.m. on the 11th of this month, a vehicle driven by Tian Rulin, the driver of the third platoon of the first company of the eleventh battalion of the Independent Automobile Corps of the Ministry of Communications, was traveling from Kunshan to Shanghai. There were many passengers along the way. While traveling east of Yuan Airport Bridge, due to the darkness of dusk and speeding, the driver was slightly careless, and the vehicle overturned into a ditch on the side of the road. Seven or eight people were injured. After the accident, the Nanyang Police Station dispatched an army to rescue them.

### Wangdian District Begins Borrowing Grain Tax

[This Newspaper Jia与 News] The field grain office of this county has been ordered to pre-borrow field grain tax to meet emergency needs. Fengqiao and Xinfeng districts have already implemented it, and the results are still good. Now Wangdian District also started on the 13th.

### Wujin Curfew

### Wuxi Economic Traitor; Zhu Jinqing's Rehearing

[This Newspaper Wuxi Thirteenth] Zhu Jinqing, an economic traitor in Wuxi, was known as the Flour King during the enemy's puppet regime.

Today, in the rehearing in Suzhou, he was sentenced to two and a half years in prison.

### Farmers in Northern Jiangsu Voluntarily Return Fields; Transportation of Local Products to the South is Becoming More Prosperous

[This Newspaper Zhenjiang Thirteenth] It is reported that farmers in the recovered areas of Northern Jiangsu, who were allocated land when the Communist army occupied it, have recently voluntarily returned the fields to their original owners. There are such phenomena in Huaiyin, Huaian, Gaoyou, Baoying, and 化. According to those familiar with the agricultural situation, there are three motivations for these farmers to return the land: (1) Because a family of five tenant farmers in Northern Jiangsu cannot make a living unless they cultivate more than 30 acres of land. Now, relying on the results of violent coercion, each person can only be allocated at most two and a half acres, and they have to bear public grain taxes and miscellaneous taxes, which outweighs the gains and is not what they want. (2) Although there were a few landlords in Northern Jiangsu in the past who enslaved tenant farmers, most of the landlords and tenants were able to depend on each other for survival. (3) Tenant farmers fear retaliation from landlords and fear losing their cultivation rights. It is heard that when a tenant farmer surnamed Ma in Gaoyou City was rejected when he returned the field, some tenant farmers actually prostrated themselves on the ground and begged.

[This Newspaper Zhenjiang Thirteenth] As Northern Jiangsu is gradually stabilized, the transportation between Jiangnan and Jiangbei is becoming more convenient. Recently, the source of rice, wheat, pigs, chickens, ducks, fish, and shrimp transported south from various places in Jiangbei is becoming more prosperous, the market in Yangzhou and Zhenjiang is active, and the price of food is more stable. The price of top-quality rice has fallen back to 42,000 yuan per stone. It is generally predicted that if Lianshu, Fengfu, and are settled, the goods will flow smoothly between Jiangnan and Jiangbei, and the Shanghai industry can also benefit from it.

### Banning Rickshaws; Zhejiang Social Affairs Department Formulates Measures

[This Newspaper Hangzhou News] Since the government decided to ban rickshaws, Zhejiang Province has repeatedly received orders to implement it effectively. It is learned that the Provincial Department of Social Affairs has formulated implementation measures, which will be implemented after being approved by the Provincial Government Committee. Since learning of this news, the rickshaw industry in this city, including cart merchants and rickshaw pullers, has been quite concerned. Most rickshaw pullers only aim to make a living and do not seem to think about the issue of humane transportation. The cart merchants are mostly　generals　enjoying　　　　　already　　　　.

### Wenling Prohibits Grain Exports

[This Newspaper Wenling News] The county government of this county, in view of the fact that the price of rice in the markets in the four villages is higher than before at this time when the new grain is on the market, has not decreased for several days. The reason is that coastal villages and towns are leaking exports by sea. This matter not only affects people's food, but also hinders military and 微 real, so it specially issued a notice to strictly prohibit the leakage of grain exports by sea.

### Lingwo Town Engages in Conscription Malpractices; Town Mayor Detained and All Bao Chiefs Involved

### Six Bandit Criminals Executed in Suzhou by Firing Squad

Two Bandits Escaped in Changshu and Were Shot Dead on the Spot

[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 13th] After the battle at Platform Mountain in the Taihu Lake Suppression Area, six bandit criminals, including Liu Shenlin, Liu Shicai, Cheng, Zhou Mingyu, Li Hanliang, and Zhou Qiheng, were captured alive.  The Wuxi court sentenced them to death. At 1:30 PM on the 13th, they were executed on the spot in the suburbs, to the delight of the people.  Additionally, a woman named Fang Yangshi from Wuxing, who was kidnapped on the 23rd night of the ninth lunar month, was rescued from danger. The headquarters is currently waiting for her family to claim her.

[Our Changshu Dispatch] Bandits Tao Liansheng and Zhu Baokang (also known as Lu Shikang) from Dongxiang, who hid firearms and acted lawlessly, confessed without hesitation after being captured.  After approval, they were sentenced to death. On the afternoon of the 11th, the security team was ordered to escort them to Meili to unearth the hidden firearms. When they arrived at Zifangdun, it was getting dark.  The two bandits, upon learning that Zhu Kun had been executed by firing squad, became terrified and attempted to escape. Seeing this, the security team, bound by their duty, immediately opened fire, and the two bandits were shot dead on the spot. A detailed report was submitted to the county. [Our Hangzhou Dispatch] The Hangyong Railway, the Shaoxing-Xiaoshan section, although completed and opened to traffic shortly after construction, was suspended due to the outbreak of the War of Resistance.  To prevent its use by the enemy after they invaded and occupied the area, it was destroyed.  Recently, the Shaoxing County Council, seeking to restore transportation and promote local prosperity, urgently hoped for its early repair.  It submitted a special request to the county government to forward to the province and then the central government for approval.  It has now been learned that the Ministry of Communications has included the Shaoxing-Xiaoshan section of the Hangyong Railway in the 36th-year plan, with construction scheduled to begin next spring and traffic expected to resume in the summer.

### Doubts Regarding Cost of Living Index: Zhedong Second District Commissioner Believes Lowering the Weight of Higher-Priced Goods is Inappropriate

[Our Wuxing Dispatch] The Second District Commissioner's Office received a report from the Wuxing County Government regarding the October cost-of-living index for workers, which, after review by various legal groups, was determined to be 5717 times the base. The Commissioner believes that the purpose of compiling the cost-of-living index for workers is to adjust their living standards. According to item 3 of the appendix to the "Methods for Compiling Workers' Living Index" promulgated by the province, "The weights in the weighted aggregate method refer to the actual monthly consumption of each item by the average worker's family." It is stated that the figures do not seem to meet the actual needs of workers' lives. For example, the listed seven dou of rice can meet the monthly needs of two large mouths, one medium mouth, and one small mouth, but three catties of pork and four eggs are considered too few. In particular, one foot of each of native unbleached cloth and white cloth is insufficient for making shoes and mending socks, let alone making clothes and quilts. Moreover, cloth, pork, eggs, and other items are all high-index goods. Lowering the weight of higher-priced goods seems inconsistent with the aim of improving workers' lives. A telegram has been sent to the Provincial Department of Social Affairs requesting verification before further instructions are issued.

### Haiyan Dredges Yong'an Lake

[Haiyan Dispatch] Yong'an Lake (commonly known as North-South Lake) in Yong'an Township of this county serves as a reservoir for irrigating thousands of acres of farmland in Ganpu and Yong'an, making it extremely important for water conservation and agricultural production. However, due to prolonged neglect of dredging, it has gradually become silted and shallow. In years with low water, it often leads to drought disasters, significantly impacting people's livelihoods. Previously, Senator Song and others initiated a request to the Good Samaritan Relief Association for funds to dredge the lake. The county government prepared a plan and forwarded it to the Zhejiang-Fujian Branch Office. It has now been learned that it has been approved. The county government has dispatched personnel to conduct a survey, and construction will commence as soon as the surveying is completed.

### New Shanghai County Magistrate Assumed Office Yesterday

Caozhen Residents Protest Discrimination

Our Caohejing Township in western Shanghai had public transportation facilities such as buses and telephones before the war. During the period of occupation, these were destroyed by the enemy. Since the victory, we have repeatedly appealed to the relevant authorities for reconstruction, but it has not been possible due to insufficient funding and lack of materials. In particular, the failure to restore bus services has caused the general public traveling between Shanghai and Caohejing to endure hardship. In July of this year, residents of this town jointly sent a letter to Xiang Sheng Transportation Company, requesting the extension of the existing Shanghai-Longhua bus route to Caohejing Town. The company agreed, allocating additional vehicles and increasing service. This has been convenient for the public for several months. Unexpectedly, starting on the 7th of this month, the company suddenly announced the suspension of the Shanghai-Caohejing route, because the Public Utilities Bureau wanted to charge the company 3/10 of their total revenue for road maintenance, plus some kind of fee of a certain percentage. The company's daily revenue is only two to three hundred thousand yuan, which needs to cover the costs of several vehicles and over a dozen staff members, resulting in very little profit. They are unable to pay the road maintenance fees. Unexpectedly, the Public Utilities Bureau considered the company to be "disregarding the law" and requested the police to force them to stop the service. As it stands, public works construction in our Caohejing Town has not been included in the budget, and all transportation, sanitation, and street lighting construction must be funded and managed locally. This measure against Xiang Sheng Company is too discriminatory against the residents of our town. We hope that the Public Utilities Bureau will immediately use its own vehicles to continue operating on this route, and not allow transportation to be cut off. The citizens would be fortunate, and society would be fortunate.

(Chen Lianhu and other residents of Caohejing Town - Editor's Note: This letter is attached with 154 different seals)

Can an Unlicensed Vehicle Speed Freely?

I am a worker who leaves early and returns late, and I have a bicycle. This morning at 6:30 AM, when I was traveling through Broadway and Zhaofeng Road, a six-wheeled khaki-colored jeep truck came speeding up from behind. The rear wheel of my bicycle was crushed beyond repair, and my foot was also injured. The truck sped away. I discovered that this jeep truck is parked at the Yangshupu Bridge every day, used to carry workers, and has no license plate. I wonder who allowed this vehicle to do business there. (Zhou Shengkui)

The Issue of Fixed-Term Deposits After the War

There was a fair court judgment for pre-war deposits to be repaid at 1,000 times the principal. However, for seven-year fixed-term small deposits made in November of the 28th year of the Republic (1939) after the war, the price of rice had already risen to 30 yuan per stone at that time. If calculated to today, it would be more than 2,000 times. The term expires this month, and I don't know how many times the loss can be compensated. When considering the repayment of the principal, I hope that the financial and judicial authorities will devise a fair and appropriate guarantee measure so that the hard-earned deposits of law-abiding people are not turned into nothing, causing too much loss. (Yang Xinshi)

### Reply to Mail

Reply to Mr. Lou Xinde: Regarding your letter about the Chenxu branch tax collection office occupying your house for rent, we have received a reply from the Municipal Finance Bureau stating: "The office address of the Xucao branch tax collection office under this Bureau originally rented from Mr. Lou Xinde's single-story house at 1762-A Huashan Road, consisting of three rooms and one shed. Previously, in response to Mr. Lou's request, it was agreed that the property would be returned upon the expiration of the lease (September 30th). As the housing shortage in Shanghai is severe, it is difficult to find a house for the moment. In order to take into consideration the needs of both parties, the branch tax collection office has been ordered to temporarily vacate two rooms for Mr. Lou to take back for his own use, and the approval has been notified to all parties. Currently, the office only rents two rooms. The claim in the original letter that it is 'transferring part of the property for rent' is not true. This Bureau has already designated a municipal public property house for the use of the Xucao branch tax collection office. It is currently in the process of taking it over from the original tenant. Once it is recovered, the two single-story houses rented from Mr. Lou will naturally be returned in full." Reply to Mr. Liu Licheng: Regarding your letter pointing out that the Jingyuan New Village is covered in garbage, we have now received a reply from the Municipal Health Bureau stating: "The 8th Squadron of the Cleaning Corps has been ordered to investigate, and it has been reported that there is no accumulation of garbage in the village. However, the village's hired sweepers are not cleaning thoroughly enough. They have been instructed to work diligently in the future, otherwise they will be sent to the police for punishment." Respectfully reported.

An Appeal from Tenants on Wuzhou Road

We, the dozens of households on Wuzhou Road, are mostly old tenants from before the war. We have lived here for more than ten years. During the August 13th Incident, we were once refugees. Fortunately, when we returned home, the houses were still there. Although the walls were broken and dilapidated, we managed to solve our housing problem through our own repairs. Midway through, the landlord sold the property to the enemy, but we still retained the right to rent. Until the victory came, the property was taken over by the state. In order to enrich the national treasury, enemy and puppet properties were put up for auction. In order to auction off the properties, the residents have to be evicted, which leads to an inability to live in peace. In short, we have already experienced the suffering of being refugees and the oppression of the enemy. We hope that today, after the victory, we will not become homeless again due to the auction. We, this group, are waiting day and night, praying for the grace of the government. (A group of tenants on Wuzhou Road)

### Four Foreign Ministers Reach Agreement: Trieste Issue Deadlock Broken: Direct Negotiations Between Italy and Yugoslavia Allowed, Conditional on Not Contradicting the Resolutions of the Peace Conference

[United Press International, New York, 13th] The Four Foreign Ministers' meeting yesterday reached an agreement on the most thorny issue of Trieste, clarifying the political direction. The deadlock was broken due to a compromise attitude on the part of Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. It is reported that the Four Foreign Ministers received a memorandum from Italy at the meeting. French representative Mauvais drew the attention of the foreign ministers to the importance of the Italian memorandum at the meeting. After lengthy discussions, three points were decided: (1) The decisions of the Paris Peace Conference regarding the Free Territory of Trieste, its central area, and its status shall be maintained. (2) The Foreign Ministers' meeting welcomes any agreement that can be reached through direct negotiations between Italy and Yugoslavia, provided that this agreement does not violate the resolutions of the Paris Peace Conference. (3) Starting from the 13th of this month, the Four Foreign Ministers' meeting will discuss the French plan for Trieste point by point.

[Reuters, New York, 13th] The Four Great Powers' Foreign Ministers decided last night to use France's draft proposal as a starting point when discussing the Trieste plan. The Four Foreign Ministers will discuss the plan item by item today. The main points are Articles 5, 6, 7, and 8. All of these articles have been passed by a two-thirds majority at the Paris Peace Conference. The provisions concern the powers of the Governor of the Free Territory. Article 6 stipulates that the Governor may recommend legislation related to the responsibility of the UN Security Council within the Free Territory, and the Governor may veto legislation that violates this responsibility. Article 7 authorizes the Governor to submit opinions to the meetings of the Trieste Government Commission. Article 8 stipulates that the Governor has the power to control public order and security in the Free Territory, handle diplomatic affairs, and appoint or remove judicial officials. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov stated yesterday that Article 7 could be accepted without modification, but Article 8 was completely unacceptable because the Governor's powers were too great and contradicted the spirit of democracy. Today, the economic experts of the Foreign Ministers' meeting began discussing the distribution of Italian reparations to countries other than the Soviet Union, the annexes to the treaties regarding insurance rights in the territory of former enemy countries, the annexes proposed by Britain regarding foreign oil rights in Romania, and the provisions for the recovery of property in the Finnish Peace Treaty.

### Italian Memorandum and Romanian Memo: Italian Foreign Minister to Visit Yugoslavia Next Week

[Reuters, New York, 12th] The Italian government today submitted another note to the Foreign Ministers' meeting, stating that the Italian government believes that the Foreign Ministers' decision to temporarily not review the Trieste resolution provides an indirect basis for the Italian government to seek a possible agreement with Yugoslavia. The Italian government believes that Marshal Tito's statement to Italian Communist leader Segregati is a positive factor in facilitating negotiations between Italy and Yugoslavia. The Italian government is considering the possibility of direct negotiations with Yugoslavia, but any agreement reached between the two countries must be guaranteed by the UN.

[Reuters, New York, 12th] Romanian Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Vlas Nasovic, who arrived here yesterday, has submitted a memorandum to the Foreign Ministers' meeting, which is expected to include Romania's views on the draft peace treaty and Romania's demands on Germany.

[Reuters, Rome, 12th] Foreign Ministry sources said: Italian Foreign Minister Nenni will travel to Belgrade next weekend. "Italian News" reported that Nenni told Finance Minister and Communist member Scoccimarro that he was waiting for a formal proposal from Yugoslavia to hold direct negotiations between Italy and Yugoslavia.

### Spanish and Palestinian Issues: Britain Seeks Solutions: Bevin Engaged in Diplomatic Activities in New York

[Reported] San Francisco, 13th Radio: British Foreign Secretary Bevin intends to take advantage of the Four Great Powers' Foreign Ministers' gathering in New York to seek compromise solutions for the two major issues of Palestine and the Franco regime. It is heard that Bevin is considering asking the United Nations to urge Franco to hold a plebiscite supervised by international organizations to determine whether the Spanish people need Franco's dictatorship. If Franco were to win the plebiscite, it would undermine the demands of the Soviet Union and its allies to sever commercial and diplomatic relations with Spain. In addition, Bevin intends to discuss with Byrnes to reach an agreement on the Palestinian issue.

### US Expresses Disagreement with Severing Relations with Spain

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, New York, 12th] Regarding the proposal by representatives of Poland and Belarus that all member states of the United Nations should sever diplomatic and economic relations with Franco's Spain, informed sources in the United States said that the US delegation firmly opposes these proposals.

### Franco's Talk

No Plans to Establish Commercial Relations with the Soviet Union: Overseas Interference Makes Elections Impossible

[Reported] San Francisco, 13th Radio: General Franco, in a separate response to questions from the Associated Press reporter today, said: Isolating Spain economically and politically will increase the possibility of war. Franco declared: Spain will not engage in commercial relations with the Soviet Union because the Soviet Union is determined to adopt an opposing attitude towards those unwilling to submit to it. While overseas interference is taking place, inciting internal rebellion in Spain, elections cannot be held. He also said: Spain will not request to join UN organizations until the animosity caused by war in the world disappears, at which point it can be considered.

### UN General Assembly Legal Committee Approves Drug Treaty

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 13th] The UN General Assembly Legal Committee approved an international drug control treaty today to replace the League of Nations' drug convention. The treaty was previously passed by the Social Committee. The Legal Committee approved the removal of Franco's Spanish regime from the treaty.

### Nehru's Birthday Today: Indians in New York Host Grand Banquet

[US Information Service, New York, 12th] This month's 14th is Nehru's birthday. The Indian Free Nation Committee will hold a grand banquet here at that time, inviting representatives of the United Nations to attend and offer congratulations. Gu Weijun will also be present.

### Hong Kong International Drug Trafficker to be Tried in Los Angeles

[Associated Press, Washington, 12th] The Treasury Department announced today that Linville, a major international criminal formerly engaged in the sale of narcotics in Hong Kong, was captured in Phoenix, Arizona, today and will be extradited to Los Angeles, California, for trial. According to investigators, Linville trafficked in Mexican opium and previously smuggled opium with others in Hong Kong. He ostensibly posed as a "righteous auction house owner," but in fact, he has been engaged in illegal activities for 30 years.

### Churchill Delivers Speech: Criticizes Soviet Control of Europe: Reaffirms Proposal to Establish United States of Europe

[Agence France-Presse, London, 12th] Former British Prime Minister Churchill delivered a speech in the House of Commons today after King George VI read the speech from the throne, emphasizing that the international situation is bleak. He stated that the world situation has not improved. He recalled that when the general election was held last year, people believed that the Labor government would be able to maintain a particularly friendly relationship with the Soviet Union. Unexpectedly, relations between Britain and the Soviet Union are deteriorating day by day. British and American troops stationed in Europe have been gradually reduced, while the Soviet Union's troops stationed in Europe still maintain their strong strength, and more than half of them are still in wartime formation, which is worthy of attention. More than one-third of Europe is now under Soviet control, and the Soviet Union's western border has reached the Elbe River. It is difficult to predict the future fate of France at this time. As for the United Nations, its achievements are far fewer than we expected, but the opposition party still consistently supports the Labor government. Foreign Minister Bevin has done everything in his power, and the opposition party has also made every effort to support Foreign Minister Bevin. Regarding the United States of Europe, I still advocate that it must be organized, and I emphasize that the unity of Europe is the cornerstone of the world organization and the UN, and the principle of establishing a world organization. As for the German people's opposition to the Allied occupation and their grievances, we sincerely hope that the German people can all make a living and handle their own affairs.

Government's Indecision on Handling Palestine Leads to Errors

Regarding the Palestinian issue, I believe that the government lacks a clear policy, which has led to the misfortune of Palestine. If we cannot implement the promises we have made to the Zionist movement, then we should immediately transfer the mandate to the UN. If the UN can accept our proposal, then the burden on our shoulders can be lifted and shared by all countries. If the United States does not agree with this step, then it should assist us with manpower and money. We want to abandon India and fight the Jews in order to give Palestine to the Arabs. This is extremely contradictory. In addition, the opposition party is requesting that Parliament discuss the Indian issue before Christmas.

### Attlee's Reply: Not to Gamble with National Security

[Agence France-Presse, London, 12th] After Churchill delivered a speech in the House of Commons today attacking the government, current Prime Minister Attlee immediately replied, reiterating the statement he made last year that "there is no question of unilaterally abandoning imperial preferences." He also said that Churchill's criticism of the Palestine issue is regrettable. Although there are many difficulties ahead regarding this issue, we are not making mistakes due to indecision. As the mandated power, we must take into account the positions of both Arabs and Jews, and we will sincerely strive to obtain the cooperation of the United States. Regarding Britain's current position, it has become more vulnerable to attack due to the development of modern warfare. We are not a part of Europe, and once war breaks out, we will have no room to breathe. Therefore, we must train reserves so that in the event of war, we do not need to undergo six months of training before we can fight. Unilateral disarmament cannot give us security. If we want to achieve security, we must establish order throughout the world. Our progress is not as fast as expected, because we cannot gamble with national security.

### British Conscription Plan

Prime Minister Announced in the House of Commons

[Reuters, London, 12th] Prime Minister Attlee announced in the House of Commons today that, under the government's new plan, the period of conscription for men at the end of 1948 will be one and a half years. It is hoped that this period can be shortened in the future. After the expiration of the term, they will enter a reserve period of several years. The main point is that the reservists must be people who have received full training.

### US Import Preferences: Export Trade Will Decrease: President Martin of the Export-Import Bank Said

### Danube River Detains Ships; U.S. Orders Return to Various Nations

[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 12th dispatch] Secretary of State Byrnes announced yesterday: The U.S. occupying authorities have been ordered to return 450 Danube River ships in the U.S., German, and Austrian occupied zones to the Balkan countries.

This decision was recently considered at the Foreign Ministers Conference.

### Japanese Armistice Terms to China: Desire to Station Troops in North China for 25 Years; Proposed to U.S. Before the Pacific War

[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 13th dispatch] The Far East International Military Tribunal continued today with prosecutors presenting various evidence, revealing the inside story of Japanese political circles from October 1941, when Konoe and Tojo had conflicting views, until the collapse of the Konoe cabinet and the rise of Tojo.

Documents Presented by the International Military Tribunal

(1) Kido's diary of October 16 records Konoe submitting his resignation to the Emperor, stating: "There is still hope for the Japan-U.S. negotiations to succeed. Regarding the troop withdrawal issue, which is considered the biggest obstacle, if we abandon the name and take the substance, there is still hope for compromise. Therefore, plunging into a major war is difficult for me, Fumimaro, but Army Minister Tojo insists on starting the war, so I cannot fulfill my responsibility as a minister." (2) Tojo's confession: Question: Before and after the collapse of the Konoe cabinet, did you feel it was necessary to declare war on the United States and the other three countries? Answer: I felt there was a danger of losing the opportunity to start the war. Question: Regarding the delivery of the final ultimatum to the United States, did cabinet members have differing opinions? Answer: The opinion was unanimous that it should be delivered to the U.S. before the attack. The timing of the delivery was decided by the Chief of Staff and the Chief of Naval Operations. Question: But the declaration of war was issued eleven hours after the attack on Pearl Harbor, do you deny that? Answer: I do not deny it. (3) Togo's instruction to Ambassador Nomura in the U.S. on November 4: Present Japan's final proposal to the U.S., which is to acknowledge equality of trade, and Japan has no intention of expanding its right of self-defense under the Tripartite Pact. Regarding the troop withdrawal issue, "After the establishment of peace between China and Japan, troops will be withdrawn from all areas except North China, Inner Mongolia, and Hainan Island within two months. Troops will be stationed in the above three areas for 25 years, and troops will be withdrawn from Vietnam when peace is achieved." (4) Nomura and Kurusu's telegram to Tokyo on November 27: Negotiations have little hope of success. The President has sent a telegram to the Emperor, and unless the Emperor replies, the deadlock cannot be broken. Once the negotiations break down, war with the U.S. and Britain cannot be avoided. (5) The U.S. intercepted an international phone call between Kurusu and Yamamoto, the director of the American Bureau of the Foreign Ministry, on November 27.

Japanese Telephone Code Words Were Numerous

Yamamoto said: "How is the marriage going? (How are the Japan-U.S. negotiations going?)" Kurusu: "Haven't you received the telegram yet? It was sent out at 7 o'clock, and it's no different from what Miss Plum (Secretary of State Hull) said yesterday." Then they discussed the issue of Japanese troops entering Vietnam. Kurusu: "For a while, the marriage seemed likely to succeed (an agreement seemed possible)." Kurusu: "How are you? Is the child about to be born? (Is the crisis approaching?)". Yamaki: "It's about to be born." Kurusu asked in surprise: "From which side?" Suddenly realizing there was something wrong with the words, he quickly said: "Is it a boy or a girl?" Yamamoto said with a smile: "It seems like a very strong boy has been born. Has there been a statement to Miss Gentleman (President Roosevelt) today?" Kurusu: "No." Yamamoto: "The matter from the day before yesterday has not yet been decided, but it is very difficult to implement. Regarding the wedding ceremony, please don't interrupt (please continue negotiations)." Kurusu: "I'll do my best. But it's impossible to come back empty-handed. The other party still hopes to continue talking about marriage, but isn't the roadside excited about the imminent delivery? And Tokugawa (the Army) can't hold back anymore?" Yamamoto: "In short, the mountain cannot be sold (there can be no concessions)."

### Japanese Reparations Conference to Be Held in U.S. Early Next Month

Everything Proceeding According to Plan

[United Press, Washington, 12th dispatch] Edwin Pauley, special commissioner for the investigation of Japanese reparations issues, declared today: The United States has now decided to begin resolving the distribution of Japanese reparations early next month, even if the Soviet Union does not participate. The United States has invited the relevant countries to hold a conference in Washington in early December, and all countries requesting reparations, except the Soviet Union, have expressed their acceptance. If the Soviet Union still does not agree at that time, we will proceed according to the planned approach. The United States is now eager to begin transferring Japanese factories to the countries requesting reparations, especially the Philippines, whose request for Japanese factories is valued at over US$10,000. Although Korea does not have the right to make a request, it may be able to receive a portion from the U.S.'s share. When a reporter asked whether the Soviet Union's delay in agreeing was due to the Japanese factories it took from the three eastern provinces of China, Pauley replied: This is one of the reasons. The Soviet Union does not want to include the issue of the factories in the three eastern provinces on the agenda.

### Soviet Representative Accuses Japanese Diet Members; Acheson Demands Evidence; U.S. and Soviet Union Engage in Heated Debate Again at the Allied Council for Japan

[French News Agency, Tokyo, 13th dispatch] At today's meeting of the Allied Council for Japan, Soviet representative Derevyanko expressed dissatisfaction with the current Japanese government and accused seventeen members of the Japanese Diet, saying that these people participated in the Taisei Yokusankai, which was presided over by Tojo, and their notorious deeds were obvious, and they should be dismissed in accordance with MacArthur's purge order issued in January of this year. Derevyanko even refused to let go of the current Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida. It is said that Yoshida recently gathered several Japanese publishers at his official residence to discuss subsidizing the publication of a biography written by a writer about the late Duke Konoe. This writer previously engaged in pro-aggression writings, and the publishers are on the list of those to be purged. What is Yoshida's intention in colluding with them? This is the first time the Soviet Union has directly attacked Japanese politicians. The chairman of the Council, U.S. representative Acheson, rose to defend and demanded that Derevyanko provide evidence, saying: "We encourage Japan to adopt democracy, and it is better to democratize our actions first. The Soviet representative's views may differ greatly from those of others, but he must realize that without concrete facts, no one can be condemned. The establishment of the Far East International Military Tribunal is based on this principle, and the Soviet Union is also listed as one of the judges. Therefore, if it is said that these Diet members were previously members of a certain group and are suddenly dismissed, the reason is insufficient and concrete evidence should be presented." Derevyanko replied: These Diet members are not only members of pro-aggression groups, but also leaders of these groups, and according to the purge order, they should be dismissed immediately. At this point, Derevyanko read out several sections of the original order to prove his point. Chinese representative General Zhu Shuming seemed to agree with the Soviet Union's view, saying that Japanese officials and Diet members who were carelessly screened in the past should be re-screened, but he stated that it was only an opinion. British and American representatives stated that the occupation police have always been cautious in purging the Japanese. After the meeting, one of the accused Diet members, Jiyuto's Aizawa, told reporters: "The Soviet representative played the role of a Japanese Communist Party spokesman this morning. I have always been attacked by the Communist Party. The mastermind behind the Japanese Communist Party is the Soviet Union, and this is now clear."

### Yuan Lvdeng's Case to Be Retried This Afternoon; Li Ze Must Also Be Retried; Supreme Court Deems Three-Year Sentence for Li to Be Inappropriate; Evidence Unfavorable to Defendant Not Shown to Defendant After Investigation

[Our Dispatch] The case of Yuan Lvdeng, suspected of being a traitor, was previously sentenced to life imprisonment by the Shanghai High Court. Yuan refused to accept the judgment and filed a petition with the Supreme Court for retrial through his lawyer, which was approved and remanded for retrial a few days ago. The High Court is scheduled to open the trial this morning for interrogation.

In addition, the case of Xue Jianqiu, a translator for the Japanese spy agency in Zhuji, is also scheduled to open this morning for the second trial.

[Our Dispatch] The case of Li Ze, general manager of Sincere Company, suspected of being a traitor, was previously sentenced to three years of imprisonment by the Shanghai High Court. The Supreme Court now considers the original judgment to be inappropriate and has remanded the case for retrial. The judgment was sent to the Shanghai High Court a few days ago and notified to the defendant himself in prison. The main reason is: Regarding the evidence unfavorable to the defendant presented by the informant, the judge did not show it to the defendant or give the defendant an opportunity to defend himself after the investigation. It is reported that Li Ze was jointly accused by employees of his company, such as Shu Yueqiao, after the victory, accusing Li of providing Water Tint Iron to the enemy and serving as a director of the puppet Chamber of Commerce. After the Shanghai High Court concluded the trial and sentenced Li to three years of imprisonment, the defendant refused to accept the judgment and filed a petition with the Supreme Court for retrial through his lawyer. The informant's side believed that the sentence was too light and had appealed to all sectors of society.

### Ding Bochu's Case Remanded for Retrial; Acquittal Makes Him Overjoyed

[Our Dispatch] Ding Bochu, the former chief of Cao Xing Township in the puppet Shanghai County, was previously sentenced to three years of imprisonment by the Shanghai High Court. After reviewing the original trial documents, the Supreme Court, based on Interpretation No. 3101 of the Judicial Yuan, believes that the defendant's tenure in the puppet government was only a service, and there was no collusion with the enemy to conspire to resist the country. It should not constitute a crime of being a traitor, and the original trial was inappropriate, so it was remanded for retrial. The case was to be retried by the High Court. The defendant claimed that he was appointed as the chief of the township by the government in 1939. Until the enemy and puppet government cleared the countryside in 1942, the original county chief fled, and he was forced by the puppet government to continue to serve as the chief of the township, but there was no act of colluding with the enemy to the detriment of the country. The designated lawyer Zhang Riping defended him. The High Court acquitted the defendant yesterday morning. Ding was overjoyed at the judgment and bowed to the court to thank them repeatedly.

The defendant only admitted to serving as a puppet plainclothes police chief, and all other items were fabricated by others when filling out his resume. (2) Lu Jiaji, director of the South District Office of the puppet Central Reserve Bank's Shanghai Branch, claimed: He graduated from the Department of Commerce of Peking China University and served as the manager of the Baotou Branch of the Bank of Communications, the assistant manager of the Tianjin Branch, and the chief auditor of the Continental Industrial Public News Agency. Due to unemployment, he joined the puppet Central Reserve Bank in June 1942 to maintain his family's livelihood. The office only handled remittance business. He was accused this time due to a housing dispute. After the interrogation, the defendant was still released on his original bail.

Chen Mingde was accused of serving as a staff member of the puppet Ministry of Interior, the puppet National Government of Jiangsu, the puppet National Government of Jiangsu Province Youth National Director, the secretary of the puppet Jiangsu Provincial Government Affairs Office, the personal secretary of Chen Qun, and the secretary of the puppet Examination Yuan with the rank of senior appointment from the end of 1939. The defendant only admitted that he had served as a staff member of the puppet Ministry of Interior for four months, and then came to Shanghai to do business.

### U.S. Seamen Have Not Yet Returned to Work; No Ships to Shanghai in the Short Term; French Ship Songdan Completed Repairs

[Our Dispatch] The U.S. Pacific seamen's strike has not yet been resolved. According to the two major U.S. shipping agencies in this city, American President Lines and Foyle Company, due to the impact of the strike, ships from the U.S. to China cannot depart as scheduled, so the number of U.S. ships arriving in Shanghai is gradually decreasing, and there may be no ships arriving in Shanghai in two weeks. That is, the ships previously berthed in Shanghai are now only leaving and not coming. American President Lines has only four or five ships, and Foyle Company has only two, which will be successively exported. In addition, the Singapore dockworkers' strike has lasted for more than a week and there is no definite news of a resolution.

### Municipal Conference Passes Adjustment of Freight Rates for Civil Ships and Coal Ships

[Our Dispatch] The Shanghai Civil Ship Commercial Guild and the Coal Ship Industry Guild submitted petitions for adjustment due to the fact that the freight rates set by the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau in May of this year differed greatly from reality, but they were rejected by the bureau. The guild, unable to bear the losses, submitted petitions again on September 12 and 14, requesting an increase of 100% in accordance with the freight rates approved in May. The Public Utilities Bureau reviewed it in detail based on cost calculation standards and found that the income and expenditure offset each other by less than 60%. In September of this year, the workers in the industry went on strike due to the rising cost of living and the failure to request an increase in wages. After mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau, the shipowners subsidized the workers with half a month's wages for September before resuming work. Now, the guild and others claim that since the freight rates have not been approved for adjustment, they are unable to continue to bear this subsidy, and a strike may occur again in the short term. They specially sent representatives to the Public Utilities Bureau on October 15 to petition for adjustment of the freight rates in order to prevent a riot. The guild's petition for adjustment of freight rates has been passed by the Municipal Conference, and it has been decided to adjust the freight rates in accordance with the original standards and current material costs.

Li Meixian (43 years old, Hunan native) was arrested at 449, Baofangfang, Laobazi Road. Two boxes of white and yellow soap and one box of Jixiang soap were seized in his home. Zhu Jiwen (37 years old, Anhui native, living at 68, Lane 645, Zhongzheng Middle Road) felt guilty when he heard the news. On the morning of May 5, he transported 329 pounds of white wool yarn, 394 pounds of gray wool paper, 608 pounds of green velvet thread, two boxes of white and yellow soap, and one box of Jixiang soap to the branch to ask for investigation. On the 6th, he went to 19 Yuqingli, Fengshou Road to arrest Zhang Yufeng (48 years old, Anhui native), and seized one box of white and yellow soap and two boxes of Jixiang soap. As of now, all the stolen goods have been recovered. It turned out that the Sixth Factory of China Textile Company had been ordered to be returned and managed by Chen. Zhu Li Ji Zhang and four others were originally employees of the factory. Taking this opportunity, they intended to embezzle the warehouse materials. They conspired with Zhu Xiangxing, Tan Jiaxiang, Yang Xin, and others who were at large. On October 18, Zhu and Tan, who were at large, rented a truck from the Huaye Transportation Company on North Chengdu Road and loaded 20 boxes of white and yellow soap and 26 boxes of steel wire circles, and delivered them to the stack room of Zhu's relatives in the Peifu Factory at 78 Mazili Road.

Other colored wool threads totaling 8,331 pounds were loaded by Zhu Jiwen on the 23rd and transported to the warehouse of the British Jardine Matheson & Co. at 47 Beijing Road to be temporarily stored by his friend Xu Naichen. On November 1, Zhu Weiwen transported it to his home. Unexpectedly, the incident was not secret and was learned by the factory. The factory sent a representative to the bureau to report the secret. After interrogation, the above four people were indeed suspected of embezzlement. It is decided to transfer them to the District Prosecutor's Office for legal action today.

### The Telephone Company's 17-Story New Building, The Location Is Being Surveyed, According to the Regulations of the Bureau of Industry and Commerce, It Must Be Built on the Bund

[Our Newspaper] After the Shanghai Municipal Council approved the proposal of the American MGM Company to build a first-class cinema in Shanghai, Mayor Wu once told reporters that part of the reason for the approval was to stimulate the city's construction industry. Since the victory, the city has not yet had such a large building project started. If the MGM cinema is completed, it will definitely give the city's construction industry a big stimulus. Yesterday, Director Wang of the Construction Department of the Municipal Bureau of Public Works told reporters that since the restoration, there has indeed not been a large-scale building project in this city. Only the American Shanghai Telephone Company has registered with the Bureau of Public Works. The company plans to build a new building because the original office on Jiangxi Road is not enough. There are four possible locations for construction: (1) the corner of Jiangxi Road and Hankou Road, that is, the open space opposite the current Municipal Government Building, (2) the intersection of Jiangxi Road and Hankou Road, on the lawn behind the current Red Church, (3) the office of the Executive Yuan on Fuzhou Road, (4) the Bund of Sima Road, the current office of the State-run China Merchants Bureau. The telephone company is currently considering it.

According to the opinion of the Bureau of Public Works, the location of the new house is best at the current site of the China Merchants Bureau, because it is close to the beach, so the height of the house can be unrestricted. However, the telephone company intends to choose the open space opposite the current municipal government building at the intersection of Jiangxi Road and Hankou Road, because it is all open space, and the current municipal government uses it as a parking lot, so construction can be started immediately after the decision is made, while the other three locations will have to wait for the demolition of the original buildings on the ground. However, according to the principle of new house construction of the Bureau of Public Works, the height of any building shall not exceed one and a half times the width of the road surface. Because the telephone company needs to build a 17-story building due to business needs, it must be built on the Bund. The person in charge of the telephone company is actively discussing with the Bureau of Public Works, and a final decision must be made in the middle of next week.

According to the statistics of the Construction Department of the Bureau of Public Works: After the victory last year, from September to December, the bureau issued only 76 business licenses, while from January to the end of October this year, it has reached more than 700, and the number of applications for construction licenses to the bureau is increasing every month. Among them, the number of city houses accounts for the majority, with more than 270 houses, followed by residences, with more than 220 buildings, and then warehouses and factories. In addition, there are 7 theaters, 10 schools, and apartments, bathhouses, teahouses, restaurants, and other numbers.

On the 5th of this month, they met their girlfriend Zhou Meiying on the way, and they exchanged greetings. Zhou claimed that she had recently returned to Wuxi from Shanghai and said how prosperous Shanghai was and how the income from working was higher than in Wuxi, and invited the sisters to come and play. Wang Ying and others were moved and followed Zhou Meiying to Shanghai. On the afternoon of the 6th, Zhou led the Yuying sisters to 52 Rongchouli, Guizhou Road, and talked with a woman for a long time, and then left in a hurry. Since Zhou left, the woman has been monitoring the Yuying sisters very closely. In the evening, she said to the Yuying sisters that this place is a brothel set up by her husband Wei Genquan, and they have been sold for a price. From now on, they should obey orders. From tomorrow night, they will follow her to solicit customers on the road. If they object, they will be whipped without mercy. When Yuying and others heard this, they knew that they had been sold by Zhou Meiying. They pretended to be happy and planned to wait for an opportunity to escape.

### Six German War Crime Suspects, Including Shen Ke, Acquitted by U.S. Military Tribunal; Still Detained Due to Case Involvement with the United Nations; Trials of Other Major Criminals to Continue

[Report from Our Newspaper] After months of trial by the U.S. Military Tribunal involving twenty-seven suspected war criminals of the Ausland Organization (AO), six individuals, namely Shen Ke, Grisch, Wotto, Hohlmann, Stohrer, and Landau, were unexpectedly acquitted yesterday. However, Chief Prosecutor O'Connor immediately announced that these six would remain in U.S. military custody, as China, the United Kingdom, or other Allied nations may also prosecute them. Furthermore, they are all at least members of Nazi organizations, and should perhaps be returned to Germany for further interrogation.

The U.S. Military Tribunal sought to adjudicate only actions committed by the defendants after the German surrender in August 1945 that were detrimental to the United States. The prosecution accused these six of being spies for the Nazi Far East intelligence agency, the Ausland Organization (AO), who, after the German surrender, continued to engage in military activities harmful to the United States, providing the Japanese military and intelligence agencies with various forms of assistance, including intelligence, propaganda, and supplies, thereby undermining Germany's unconditional surrender.

Shen Ke was accused of being a "Number One Spy" specially trained by the German High Command, having been active in Chongqing and coastal cities of China. Not long ago, Randall, the manager of the United Press office in China, was sued by Shen Ke in our local court for exposing Shen Ke's espionage activities. Randall was acquitted, and Shen Ke's appeal to the High Court was also rejected.

Grisch, the leader of the German community in Guangzhou, was accused of collecting intelligence on the activities of the United States and its Allied nations' sea, land, and air forces and providing it to the Japanese military.

Wotto, the leader of the Nazi organization in South China, was accused of the same crimes as Grisch.

Hohlmann, the ambassador to the puppet government, was identified in the indictment as the superior of the Ausland Organization (AO).

Stohrer, the head of the Shanghai office of the puppet embassy, was also accused of being a superior of the Ausland Organization (AO). Landau was the consul of the puppet government in Shanghai, accused of being a direct superior of the Ausland Organization (AO).

The acquittal of the six was the result of a request by the defendants' defense lawyers to release all twenty-seven defendants. The defense lawyers raised three points of protest: (1) the terms of the German surrender do not apply to the defendants; (2) the charges in the indictment do not demonstrate that the defendants undermined the German surrender; and (3) the evidence provided by the prosecution is insufficient.

The court rejected the first point, stating that the German surrender was an unconditional surrender, not limited to the military, but applicable to any German national. The acquittal of Grisch and the other five was based on the remaining two protests. The trial of the Ausland Organization (AO) and the remaining defendants will continue, with the next hearing scheduled for 8:00 a.m. today.

Therefore, alumni gather here, in this assembly hall, to commemorate the dead, those who died for the country, to encourage the living, to unite and carry forward, some researching academics, advocating the Three Educations, others promoting public welfare, acting for national construction, benefiting people and things, truly planning for the good.

Regarding the import of Japanese ships, it has attracted the attention of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs. A telegram was sent to the Ministry's office in Shanghai for investigation. The director of the Shanghai office, Chen Guolian, telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs with the results of the investigation. The text of the two telegrams is as follows: (1) Telegram from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: "According to a phone call from the Chief of Staff of the Naval Headquarters, the Japanese ship 'Fourth Hinode Maru' is being detained at the Wusongkou, displaying Japanese pilot symbols but not flying the Japanese flag. Inquire whether it should be allowed to enter the port, the ship's mission in China, and its nationality, and whether permission has been obtained from the Allied Headquarters. Also, whether the import of such ships has been agreed upon with any aspect of our country. Please verify the truth with customs and other agencies and report the handling progress to the Ministry." (2) Telegram from Chen Guolian, Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs: "Regarding the arrival of the Japanese ship 'Fourth Hinode Maru' in Shanghai, received your Ministry's 28th dispatch of the 8th of this month. Inquired with the Naval Command, Commander Wei stated that the ship is a Japanese merchant ship piloted by Japanese personnel, permitted by General MacArthur's headquarters, transporting exchange materials for the Central Trust Bureau from Japan to Shanghai. This headquarters (Naval Command) has permitted it to enter the port."

### Salt Loan

Total Exceeds Seventy Percent

The Shanghai area salt loan, led by the Bank of China and organized by a banking syndicate, is proceeding smoothly. The total amount of loans has exceeded 70% or more. In terms of transportation and sales, mortgaged and pawned goods total 1.2 million piculs, amounting to 13.2 billion yuan. Salt from Qingdao, Lianyungang, and Fujian is being transported to Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Henan provinces for sale. Loan negotiations are still underway for approximately 7 billion yuan. According to the banking syndicate, the total amount for transportation and sales loans is 16.8 billion yuan. Later, the [Illegible] Bureau, due to the need for salt in Henan Province [Illegible], requested an increase, specifying 100,000 piculs per month, with a three-month turnover, totaling 300,000 piculs, increasing the loan by 4 billion yuan, for a total of 20.8 billion yuan. As for production loans, originally set at 4.4 billion yuan, 1.4 billion yuan has been loaned to salt fields in Zhejiang, and 900 million yuan to Fujian. Currently, due to increased shipping costs, the salt price will soon be reported by the Salt Affairs Administration to the Four Joint Offices, which will adjust the loan amount according to current costs to the 70% mortgage value. (Previously, the market price of salt per picul was approximately 19,000 yuan, so the mortgage price was 13,000 yuan. Now the cost is 24,000 yuan, so there is a need to increase the mortgage value.) According to [Illegible] insiders, since the organization of the banking syndicate and unified management, there is a guaranteed supply in the sales areas, but it avoids overstocking. Therefore, salt merchants' business has become increasingly stable. Even if there are no excessive profits to be made, losses can be maintained, which is different from the past when salt merchants' loans were monopolized by powerful individuals, and small salt merchants could not obtain their share. It is also known that with the current low water level in the Yangtze River, large quantities of salt are concentrated around Hankou to meet the peak winter sales season. It is expected that the salt needs of the military and civilians this year can be assured.

### Question of Erroneous Strokes on Election Ballots; Ministry of Interior Interprets Liberally

Chinese characters are complex. In election affairs in various regions, disputes often arise due to slight errors in the names of candidates written on election ballots. The Ministry of Interior's liberal interpretation of this issue has been issued to Shanghai, stating: "Any additions, subtractions, or misspellings in the strokes of characters that, based on the circumstances at the time, would not lead to misidentification as another name, should be considered valid." The Municipal Government has relayed this to all agencies and organizations for compliance, which should reduce election disputes in the future.

### New Armband for Military Police; To Be Worn Starting New Year's Day

Regarding the Military Police Headquarters being reorganized into the General Headquarters of the Land, Sea, and Air Force Military Police on January 1 of next year, the reporter learned from the 23rd Regiment of the Military Police in this city that the order has not yet been received. However, the "armband" worn by the military police has been ordered to be redesigned for the winter uniforms this year, and will be used starting January 1 of next year. The armband's design is similar to the New Life Movement emblem, embroidered with the characters for "Military Police," and attached to the left shoulder. Military police serving at the National Assembly in Nanjing are already wearing it in advance. The armbands will be used uniformly across the country starting next year to standardize the appearance.

### Pier Construction in Nanshi; Dredging of Huangpu River Begins

The Nanshi area, along Dongjiadu to Dongchang Road, originally had eighteen piers. Damaged by the Japanese during the war, only Piers 7, 8, 12, 14, 15, 16, and 17 remain. The rest have been completely destroyed, and the Huangpu River has not been dredged for many years, causing siltation of the riverbed. Not only does the rebuilding of piers require dredging first, but even repairing the remaining ones necessitates dredging. The Public Works Bureau has decided to start dredging work from No. 1 to No. 4, with the consent of the Dredging Bureau. The Hailong vessel will be dispatched from Zhoujiadu in Pudong to begin work, estimated to take three weeks to complete, at a cost of approximately 200 million yuan. The funds will be drawn from the regular shipping berthing fees.

### Conspiracy to Steal Pig Bristles; Two Main Suspects Escorted from Changzhou to Shanghai

[Report from Our Newspaper] On the night of the 26th of last month, four boxes of pig bristles, valued at over five million legal currency, were stolen from the Baofeng Pig Bristle Company in this city. The case was immediately reported to the Tilanqiao Police Station for investigation. The police found that Yang Yuansheng, an employee of the company, was suspected of receiving stolen goods and summoned him for interrogation. It was learned that the case was committed by Yang Boting in collusion with Gao Caixing, Zhang Shaojin, Zhu Depan, and others, who had all fled to Changzhou afterward. The precinct chief, Zhang Renyou, ordered three plainclothes detectives from the criminal division, Gong Tinghe, Chen Dianzeng, and Wu Quan, to proceed to Wujin County on the 9th of this month, in conjunction with the Wujin County Criminal Police Team, to arrest the main suspects Gao Caixing and Yang Boting in Xuantang Fengming Town. Over forty catties of pig bristles were seized at Yang's home. The suspects were escorted to Shanghai. One box of stolen goods was recovered at No. 74, Tianbao Lane, Xinjiang Road. It is reported that the remaining suspects are still being pursued.

### New Invention: Multifunctional Active Furniture

[Report from Our Newspaper] To save resources and in line with the spirit of the New Life Movement, Mr. Dai Xinan has invented a type of multifunctional active furniture. Its characteristics are: it can be rotated as desired, its height can be adjusted, and it can be detached and folded. The basic structure of this active furniture is divided into three parts: (1) a triangular bracket; (2) a tube body; and (3) a three-legged frame, all made of steel. In combination with other accessory parts, it can be used to create stools, chairs, round tables, square tables, lamp stands, clothes racks, flower pot stands, etc., as well as the basic pillars for all furniture, with over seventy different sizes and uses.

Mr. Dai gave this basic structure a new name, calling it "Jiu". When folded, its volume is only one-sixth of a cubic foot, but it can bear a load of up to 1,500 pounds. As for the stools, chairs, tables, and racks constructed from it, Mr. Dai also gave them a new name, calling them "Jie".

This latest invention of multifunctional furniture has obtained Patent No. 76 from the Ministry of Economic Affairs. At the same time, Mr. Dai is striving for perfection, continuously improving. The future development is truly unlimited.

### Joint Conspiracy to Strangle Husband; First Hearing Held Yesterday

Cheng Haorang and the Deceased [Illegible], Allegedly Not Husband and Wife

[Report from Our Newspaper] On the morning of the 4th of this month, a strangled male corpse was discovered in the Xiaogou Lane on Gonghe New Road, Zhongxing Road, Zhabei. After police investigation, Xu Meifang and a woman named Cheng Cuiyun [Illegible] were arrested. They were transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office yesterday morning, and at 2:00 p.m., Prosecutor Liang Gengshun conducted the initial interrogation. Cheng Cuiyun claimed that she was not married to the deceased, but was only engaged to him at the age of fourteen by her parents. However, the wedding was never held, and they never cohabited. She was formally married to Xu Meifang and had a miscarriage in October of this year. She knows nothing about Gu Yucai's death. Xu Meifang also denied jointly conspiring to strangle Gu Yucai. The prosecutor immediately ordered both defendants to be remanded in custody. Further evidence needs to be collected in this case for proper handling.

### Car Accident While Outing with Girlfriend; Injured Woman Sues for Compensation; Ministry Orders "Expeditious Handling"

[Report from Our Newspaper] On the morning of August 18th of this year, a Soviet Jew, Sussgen, drove a small Jeep, inviting his girlfriend, Rose格兰 (an American citizen), Far克, La图, 卡士密儿夫, and others, to tour Minhang. At 2:10 p.m. on the way, due to speeding and careless driving, the car suddenly overturned. Everyone in the car was injured, among whom La冈 was seriously injured and died, and Rose格兰 injured her knee, which recovered after medical treatment. Rose recently filed a complaint with the District Prosecutor's Office against Sussgen, demanding compensation for medical expenses and other losses totaling US$5,650.

### U.S. Military Subpoenas Witness in Zhang Case; Refused Due to Lack of Official Documents

Yesterday, the U.S. Military Law Office dispatched 贝格特 Burgund to the District Prosecutor's Office to request the questioning of Spanish sailor 赖伦斯 who is in custody, as a witness. The District Prosecutor's Office refused because 贝 did not have formal documents, which is legally non-compliant.

### First Batch of 56 Returned Overseas Chinese to Be Sent to Xiamen for Centralized Repatriation

The Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Office has approved the repatriation of the first batch of 56 returned overseas Chinese who registered for departure and rehabilitation. The repatriation procedures are currently being processed. As Shanghai is not a port of departure, the CNRRA Shanghai Branch has decided to send the group of overseas Chinese to Xiamen for centralized repatriation. The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) will then be responsible for repatriating them to their original places of residence. Considering the limited number of ships going to Southeast Asia, to ensure the timing of the voyages, the Shanghai Branch hopes that the group of overseas Chinese will report to the branch as soon as possible to be sent to Xiamen for centralized waiting and repatriation. The Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Office has separately notified the registered returned overseas Chinese to collect their repatriation certificates promptly to facilitate early repatriation.

### Reader Consultation: Medicine and Health

(1) Roaring in Both Ears

Xu Fei asks: Several years ago, I suffered from a fever, and both eardrums suddenly ruptured, causing pus to be present in my ears and constant tinnitus. After being treated by a specialist with washing, ear drops, nasal drops, and air insufflation, and taking internal medicine, the pus in my ears has stopped flowing, but the tinnitus remains, causing me great pain. I read in the newspaper that physical therapy equipment (hearing aids) is effective for the above symptoms. Please advise.

[Reply by Dr. Gu Yuqi] Chronic otitis media requires long-term treatment by an ear specialist to be effective. Taking various vitamins internally can also help with treatment.

(2) White Spots on Both Eyes

Gu Zhaolian asks: My mother is 48 years old this year. She has always been very weak and has lung disease. Five years ago, she suffered from itchy corners of her eyes, dry nostrils, and tearing. Afterwards, red [Illegible] appeared in her eyes. Two small white dots, the size of half a grain of rice, were found inside the upper corner of the black cornea. After a few days, they merged and covered the entire cornea, leaving only a portion in front of the pupil, so she can still see slightly, but her vision is blurry when she squints. She was treated by a traditional Chinese medicine ophthalmologist, but it was ineffective. After a month, the red [Illegible] receded. The "white spot" on her black cornea has not receded. Unexpectedly, her right eye developed the same condition five days ago. What good method can cure my mother's illness?

[Reply by Dr. Gu Yuqi] She must be taken to an ophthalmologist for a detailed examination and treatment immediately. Each municipal hospital in this city has experts in charge of diagnosis.

(3) Joint Pain

Yuan Mingzhu asks: My friend's mother is 57 years old this year. In January of last year, she suddenly felt numbness in both knees, which gradually extended from her knees to the bones between her chest and back, as if bound by ropes. She experiences pain day and night, and her skin often feels hot. Any slight movement causes her entire body to be pulled and her breathing to be labored. For over a year now, she has been bedridden. Although she has taken bone pain relief tonics and blood-activating decoctions, and has been injected with 606, none of them have been effective. Please tell me the name of this disease and the treatment method. I would be eternally grateful if she could be cured.

[Reply by Dr. Gu Yuqi] The numbness and dysfunction in both knees may be related to high blood pressure and hardening of the blood vessels. She must be examined by an internal medicine specialist for detailed blood pressure, urine, and various brain-related symptoms to determine the correct medication.

### Oil Price Problem: Oil Rationing to Begin Next Week; Social Affairs Bureau to Convene Oil Price Meeting; Registration for Retailers Begins Today

[Our Newspaper's Report] Due to a limited supply of cooking oil yesterday and insufficient oil allocation from private factories, merchants seized the opportunity to hoard. The market price of various cooking oils rose again. It is reported that the principles for oil rationing have been established. Starting next week, in addition to the National Food Oil Company and the China Vegetable Oil Factory each allocating 10,000 dan of cooking oil monthly directly to retail oil merchants, private factories will also allocate 12,000 dan of cooking oil monthly for rationing. Therefore, the city will have a regular supply of 32,000 dan of cooking oil monthly, which should stabilize oil prices. Yesterday, the Social Affairs Bureau, seeing the resurgence of price hikes in the oil market, advised merchants not to hoard and refuse to sell. It is reported that merchants have complied and are selling their stocks. Therefore, oil prices should stabilize today. Furthermore, the Social Affairs Bureau, noting that current oil prices are slightly inconsistent with costs, will convene an oil price negotiation meeting at 2:00 PM on the 15th. Attendees will include representatives from the Municipal Government, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, the Municipal Council, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Oil Pressing Guild, the Oil Retailers' Guild, and the China Vegetable Oil Factory.

Additionally, the Retailers' Guild of Grain, Oil, and Oilseed Cakes in the city (i.e., the Oil Retailers' Guild) announces that, starting next week, 12,000 dan of oil monthly will be rationed from private factories. Registration for all oil retailers in the city will be conducted from today until the 16th, daily from 12:00 PM to 6:00 PM. Members should register. Non-members should complete both membership and registration procedures. The registration location is the guild's headquarters on the third floor of No. 37, Minguo Road.

### Gold Prices Fall, U.S. Dollar Remains Stable

Gold futures were weak yesterday, remaining generally stable, mostly in trading. The opening was 2.445 million, and after opening, although rising to 2.465 million, supply became available, and the bullish side retreated, knowing it would be difficult to win. Due to rationing, actual sales were quiet, falling to 2.422 million before stabilizing and rising slightly. After 10:00 AM, the Central Bank allocated 200 bars at a price of 2.425 million, after which buying interest gradually increased. By noon, supply dried up again, and the price rebounded to 2.46 million. The initial morning rise then retreated. There were no special changes for next-day delivery, down 18,000 from before the close. Gold ornaments and plain silver also remained unchanged. Silver dollars rose slightly. Overnight interbank lending rates eased significantly, with interest rates falling to 11 to 14 percent.

Foreign currencies followed the gold market's fluctuations, initially flat then stable. U.S. dollars initially traded at 4,270 to 4,320 yuan, falling to around 4,250 yuan mid-day. New buyers entered the market at noon, driving the price back up to 4,270 yuan buying and 4,320 yuan selling, close to levels before the close. Hong Kong dollars initially weakened then recovered, ending 5 yuan lower than before the close. Hong Kong exchange rates were stable, with buying at 870 yuan and selling at 880 yuan. Indian exchange rates were 1,055 to 1,065 yuan. British exchange rates were 14,050 to 14,150 yuan. Trading volume was light in all currencies. The official U.S. dollar exchange rate remained unchanged.

### Foreign Stocks Rise and Fall

Foreign stocks showed some stability yesterday in smaller issues, while larger issues were unable to maintain their strength. As a result, compared to before the close, Jardine Wovens, British American Tobacco, Jardine Matheson, and China Merchants Steam Navigation declined, while paper stocks rose slightly. Wheelock Marden and Shanghai Land Investment remained flat.

### Public Bonds Stable

Public bonds were stable yesterday due to a certain brokerage on the fifth floor absorbing bonds on behalf of Western merchants. Unified bonds saw varied activity from large investors but remained largely unchanged. Approximately 5 million yuan changed hands. Unified bonds opened at 1,450 yuan, gradually declining from 1,500 yuan to below 1,400 yuan before stabilizing, ultimately fluctuating between 1,420 and 1,450 yuan, resulting in a slight increase of 10 yuan compared to last Saturday. Categories A, B, and D rose 50 yuan, while Category E rose 90 yuan.

### Tung Oil Sales Remain Stagnant

Due to unfavorable export conditions, white tung oil has seen little trading for a long time. Domestic sales are also limited due to the restricted sales order, and the market is difficult to invigorate as new supplies are arriving. Since both domestic and foreign sales cannot be smooth, there's difficulty to stimulate the market. However, due to rising wages in various regions, the market appears tough despite the lack of sales, with tung oil's increase in relation to other goods still within strict limits. Recently, shipments from various places have increased gradually, and all channels are for storage in anticipation of sales, not immediate use. As for silk, without changes to the exchange rate, there's no development in exports. Considering the current market, improvement is difficult to expect, only stabilization is possible. Shanghai's foreign trade has been quiet for a long time. Domestic price of standard weight is 125,000 yuan, with very scattered sales. Tung oil sales in Hongjiang are not good, inventory is still high, winter sales are scarce, and development is expected only in the spring. The price for each barrel of various brands of western oil is 100,500 yuan.

### Caustic Soda Market Prices in Disarray Due to Shortage

Since the United States banned exports, the supply of caustic soda in Shanghai has been dwindling, so prices have risen by more than one grade since February. The prices of American goods have also risen one or two times. Tianjin and Qingdao also have a large demand, requiring 3,000 to 4,000 barrels this week, and specifying American goods. As a result, prices for domestic caustic soda are lower than those for American goods. Holders of goods in Shanghai, feeling that it is not easy to find sources, are unwilling to sell easily. On Monday afternoon, the market price was 930,000 yuan per barrel of 300 kilograms, but there were not many transactions. Prices sold by merchants varied, but all were higher than the market. Yesterday, the market price was extremely chaotic, with some asking for 1.5 million yuan before being willing to sell.

### The "Delivery" Issue: Brokers Request Changes Regarding Margin and Guarantee Funds

The Delivery Brokers' Association yesterday made a request to the Exchange, stating that the Exchange should only collect fees from one party for daily "Delivery" transactions that are settled. Also, guarantee funds should not be collected from brokers with balances less than 150 million yuan, and that only excess amounts should be paid according to regulations. The association stated that brokers have already paid 50 million yuan in guarantee funds, and the Exchange should not increase brokers' burden during this difficult time. It was also reported that brokers indicated that if the Exchange does not accept these requests, there may be a complete refusal to participate in "Delivery" transactions.

### Chinese Stocks: The Market Had Just Begun to Improve, But Was Again Dampened by the Current Situation

Chinese stocks opened lower yesterday due to the uncertain situation and widespread speculation. After opening, Cantonese investors bought on the dips, creating an upward trend and even reaching high prices. However, large securities firms repeatedly sold at high prices, and banks also sold. After 10:00 AM, the market turned down, with wild fluctuations and a chaotic pattern. Generally, the market was not very strong as many bulls liquidated their positions before the close. Around noon, major players such as Taiwan floated many and No. 151 showed a desire to sell, intensifying the decline. Except for a few companies whose stocks repeatedly rose to their limit, Ying An once hit its limit. Lun He was stable despite the decline, but the others were all weak. Around noon, all stocks were trading at low prices. Compared to before the close, popular stocks such as Wing On, Silk, Jingfu, and New Kwong fell slightly, Meyer fell by half a percent, while Chin Hwa alone fell by 1.5 percent. Trust and Harmony rose slightly, while unpopular stocks such as Match fell by half a percent, Five Harmony fell by half a percent, Li An and New Shanghai also fell slightly by one percent, and the rest remained stable or declined slightly. In the afternoon, it was rumored that the Communist representatives had returned to Yan'an, and that brokers had made a request to the Exchange that if the Exchange did not accept their requests, all would refuse to participate in "Delivery" transactions. Many investors were hesitant, and selling increased, intensifying the bearish trend. Stocks continued to fall, becoming increasingly severe, making the market cautious. Chin Hwa and First Kwong fell to their limit, while Huo Ying and Wei Hwa rose. However, both soon stabilized. Near the close, all stocks traded in a chaotic pattern. Compared to before the close, popular stocks such as Wing On and Ts'ai Ho fell by one and a half percent, Meyer, Jingfu, and New Kwong each fell by about one percent, Dong Hing fell by one and a half percent. Among the unpopular stocks, Yung Kung rose by half a percent, China Textile, Tung Yih, New Asia, and Li An fell by one percent, Five Harmony, Underwear, and Match fell by one and a half percent, and the rest had slight adjustments. The total transaction volume for the day was 17.24 million shares, with very small increases and decreases in off-exchange trading.

### Artificial Silk Market Still Has a Black Market; Cotton Cloth Retail Activity Remains Flat

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday, the artificial silk market was still in a state of concealed speculation. 10-count and 16-count yarns could potentially be purchased at the controlled price. However, for yarns of 20 counts or higher, purchasing at the official price was practically impossible. Brokers had to buy at inflated prices. Common lightweight yarns such as 20-count Red Star and Gold City were priced around 2.05 to 2.06 million yuan, exceeding the controlled price by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan, about 30,000 to 40,000 yuan higher than on the 11th. Heavyweight yarns such as Special Double Horse were also trading at 2.28 million yuan, with very few transactions, as both buyers and sellers were wary.

The cotton cloth market was flat. Broker demand had decreased, while local demand was slightly more active due to the colder weather. Transactions focused on dark-colored Shilin Yuan Bi Ji. However, supply was still sufficient, and prices remained largely unchanged, except for Shilin, which was slightly higher by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan due to the sharp increase in dye prices. There was more trading in bleached "Jumping Carp" cloth. Although the 12-pound fine cloth was out of stock in various factories, the cost of replenishing raw materials was lower because the yarn was rationed, so factories were willing to sell at the current price. As a result, there was no immediate upward trend. Dragon Head fine cloth was still trading at 83,000 yuan, while Bi Ji was priced at 94,000 yuan.

### U.S. Price Increases Likely to Cause Disputes Over Orders

[Our Newspaper's Report] The recent cancellation of special price controls in the United States will have an impact on China's import and export industries. A reporter specially interviewed a person in charge of the industry. According to the discussion, after the United States cancelled special price controls, the trend of commodity prices in the United States will increase. As a result, some fixed transactions in the import and export industry will also suddenly change. Since the victory, import and export firms in Shanghai have sprung up like mushrooms, reaching more than 600 to date. Since most American manufacturers already have exclusive or specialized resident agents in China, these firms can only transact with foreign distributors or import and export firms. Ordinary transactions often rely on a single telegram to finalize. If prices rise after the order is placed, the supplier often delays delivery. If U.S. prices continue to rise in the future, similar situations will be more common. Some orders do not specify a price at the time of ordering and instead use the invoice price at the time of shipment. Therefore, importers today have no way to estimate the price of an order in advance. It is hoped that a trade dispute arbitration committee can be quickly established between China and the United States to fairly handle all trade disputes between China and the United States in order to resolve these delayed delivery disputes.

### U.S. Cotton Continues to Rise

[United Press, New York, December 12] Cotton trading was slightly more active today, with varying increases and decreases in far-month contracts. According to private sources, cotton farmers are still hoarding cotton, waiting for better prices. At the final close, the highest increase was 2.10 dollars per bale, and the lowest decrease was 5 cents. Also, [United Press] New Orleans, December 12, far-month cotton prices rose across the board today due to the impact of cotton fabric controls stimulating purchases. The closing price rose 5 cents to 2.50 dollars per bale.

### New Trends in Sugar

The sugar market trend was stable yesterday. The association quoted a price of 138,500 yuan for existing medium-grade white sugar, 118,000 yuan to 120,000 yuan for raw sugar, and a small amount of new Huanggang sugar from the oil merchants had arrived, opening at 116,000 yuan. Old goods were at 110,000 yuan, Xinhua White at 123,000 yuan, and Xinhua Red at 120,000 yuan to 118,000 yuan. The Tianjin merchant started moving, hence the price increase, opening at 20, which was called at 110,000 yuan but not traded.

### No Significant Progress in the Tea Market

In the Bingzhuang tea market, the sellers of Keemun new black tea were asking for around 7-8 million yuan per dan, which was difficult to sell. Therefore, Yingzhuang switched to selling Bailin new black tea and Keemun old black tea. As for the Chuzhen and Zhenmei green teas, the new goods were priced extremely high, and only a few export firms purchased them.

### Zhongxin Bureau's Allocation of Rayon: Black Market Trading Means Manufacturers Hurt Themselves

[Our Newspaper's Report] A person in charge of the Government Property and Materials Management Committee, which is represented by the Central Trust Bureau (Zhongxin Bureau), said to reporters yesterday: Since the committee implemented 11 articles related to the allocation of rayon on the 17th of last month, the committee has been allocating rayon according to these measures. When allocations began last month, only half a month remained until the end of the month. The committee approved the allocation of approximately 70% of what each silk weaving factory applied for, totaling over 1,030 boxes. According to a reliable estimate, the actual monthly demand for rayon from silk weaving factories in Shanghai is approximately 2,500 boxes. Therefore, the total amount allocated this month is expected to be no less than that number. Also, if the second batch of Japanese rayon arrives, the committee may find a way to increase allocations. However, the committee has already reviewed and approved each factory's allocation amount based on its application amount and actual demand. The committee opens up rayon sales eight times a month, and each factory can open up to its approved allocation amount with the committee one or eight times. It has been learned that there have been several openings this month. However, some manufacturers made full purchases in one or two openings. Those manufacturers were selling rayon on the black market for profit due to the high prices and then reapplying to the committee. Since the committee had purchased enough, it could not reallocate. Those factories were then forced to repurchase from the black market, thus creating an opportunity for black market holders to raise prices. All of those manufacturers who sold for profit are eating their own words. Although the committee is allocating to various applying manufacturers, their actions are like spinning silk to bind themselves with. It is truly not knowing the value of favors. The committee has heard that they are closely watching factories reselling for profit and will be severely punished if necessary.

The Black Market Remained Keen Yesterday

Although the Central Trust Bureau continued to allocate rayon, black market prices continued to soar. This was because the allocation quantity was insufficient to meet factory needs, and despite wanting to calm the market, the market was actually even higher. Yesterday, the No. 120 Tianqiao old shipment had light, the morning was done to 750,000 yuan, to 612,000 yuan close, because there were actual sales households procurement, quite a transaction, resulting in more rebound, the old shipment actually shouted up to 900,000 yuan, the new shipment to 750,000 yuan, an increase of about 300,000 yuan compared to Monday. Other brands of semi-gloss rose by 200,000 yuan. Only the No. 150 glossy yarn had no demand, and the price was still the same as on Monday and did not open. The factory's price slightly changed yesterday. Products with slight defects, such as C-grade, were worth 3.6 million yuan. Ordinary high-end new goods on the market were priced at around 3.6 million yuan per load. Silk products did not change much yesterday, only the patterned feather yarn increased slightly by 50 yuan. However, raw material prices are still rising, and it is difficult for silk prices to maintain their original state.

### Sugar Price Review Committee Meeting; Medium Sugar Sells for 130,000 Yuan

The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau held its eighth Sugar Price Review Committee meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday, deciding on five items: (1) The determined price of edible sugar is 130,000 yuan for medium-grade sugar and 110,000 yuan for raw sugar; (2) If there is a surplus of sugar purchase certificates in each district, they should be returned, and if there is a shortage, they should be reissued; (3) The standard weight of hemp bags is specified, and the Social Affairs Bureau, Civil Affairs Office, and Southern Goods Industry Association will jointly conduct on-site investigations to determine; (4) The issue of sugar rationing for households in rural areas such as Huajiang and Xinshijie is decided to be handled by the Civil Affairs Office and the Southern Goods Industry Association; (5) The next sugar allocation will be discussed at the next meeting.

### Rice Market Arrives in a Rush, Sales are Sluggish; Oil Prices Remain Unchanged

Another 2,000 Bags of Hunan Rice Arrive

Yesterday, a total of more than 15,000 shi of rice arrived at the North and South River docks. Digestion was still sluggish. In fact, under the high interest rates, the factories and firms abandoned the original intentions of storing food. The purchasing power faded, and the market situation deteriorated. Northern japonica rice saw a sharp drop of 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Southern japonica rice continued to fall by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Yangbu Indica also dropped by a small amount of 1,000 yuan. Indica rice also became sluggish with few transactions. White yuan and team yuan also fell by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Soybean oil from the Fujian factory was slightly more active, and the market was strong. Soybean cake from Nanyang was slightly advanced, and the market rebounded by 200 to 300 yuan. The subsequent situation still depends on the digestion of various ports. Bran rebounded slightly by 100 to 200 yuan. Flour arrivals increased slightly, and the appetite was very light, falling by 300 to 400 yuan. Various factories distributed 300 dan of oil to the oil market, and the price remained the same. There were no transactions outside the market. Broad beans are in a stable trend. Red beans are good for high-quality goods, but medium-quality goods lack spirit, still in an escalating discount. Red sorghum rebounded slightly by 300 to 500 yuan. Sesame is scarce and strong. The Guangzhou gang has been buying groundnuts, continuing to rise by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Corn in Qingdao picked up.

In addition, a small amount of Hunan rice has arrived at the port. Yesterday, the Sanbei Company's Mingxing vessel transported more than 500 pieces of flue-cured tobacco and 2,000 bags of Hunan rice from Wuhan to Shanghai.

### The Compound Distribution Association Strictly Prevents False Reporting

Set up a secret complaint box and welcome letters of举报 (jiǔ jǔbào) to report accusations. Set up an exchange, so that the same trade can barter each other.

Since the Auxiliary Products Cotton Yarn Distribution Association handled the distribution of yarn, the work was extremely tense, but because there were so many members of the trade, the manufacturing plant locations were scattered, and the situation was complex. It was inevitable that the declared production power and required quantity would be falsely reported, and in order to prevent this malpractice from arising, in addition to sending personnel to investigate separately, another announcement was made and a secret complaint box was placed at the gate of the association. Accusations were welcome, and the main points are recorded as follows:

(1) Anyone who discovers that a member of the trade is reporting inaccurate production machines and operating rates, reselling allocated cotton yarn for profit, or joining two guilds to fraudulently receive distributed yarn may report it to the association in secret.

(2) When making a secret report to the association, please provide a formal letter, sign and seal it, mark "Secret" on the envelope, and drop it into the secret complaint box.

(3) The Chairman of the Board will open the secret letter himself, and strict confidentiality will be maintained both internally and externally.

In addition, since the yarn allocated to each member of the trade could not be generally applied, which lead to the occurrence of return, the Auxiliary Products Cotton Yarn Distribution Association specially petitioned the Spinning Management Committee to establish a cotton yarn exchange. The detailed measures have already been approved, and the issue of staffing is still handled by a member of the association serving as an assistant. Letters have already been sent to each member of the trade to handle registration matters first. The exchange measures, prices, etc. will be handled in accordance with the Spinning Management Committee's approved handling, and this organization will handle the mutual exchange of affairs within the same trade completely. If there is any allocated yarn that cannot be applied, the Association will deliberate and trade to each other. The number of supports and price difference, then the funds will be subsidized and returned in accordance with the cotton yarn conversion method.

### Commercial Briefs

Timber: Foreign pine prices have increased due to rising prices in foreign producing areas, and sellers have mostly raised prices, but because the market sales are small, the increase is still small. Fir prices are still stable.

Hardware: Actual sales are not moving, the market is getting tired every day, and the customer base is watching and waiting. Business is extremely sluggish.

Red Dates: New red dates from Tianjin have been arriving in increasing numbers recently, totaling 6,000 to 7,000 bags, so the market is very soft. Good-quality dates of all grades were priced at 150,000 yuan, and black dates and walnuts were also very weak.

### Correction: Letter from Hae Nying Soeng

In the November 10th issue of your newspaper, there was a news item entitled "Japanese White Newsprint Resold Through U.S. Hands," stating that Hae Nying Soeng has shipped a large quantity of Japanese white newsprint. Hae Nying Soeng is in the business of newsprint trading. Our company (Hae Nying Soeng Exclusive Export Trading Co., Ltd.) specializes in selling Canadian white newsprint and does not sell white newsprint from other sources. We hope you will make a correction.

### Cooperative Factory Coming to Fruition; Two Major Issues Awaiting Resolution: Organizational Structure and Profit-Sharing Methods

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, the Ministry of Social Affairs, the Shanghai Branch of the National Cooperative Marketing Administration, and the China Silk Company will hold a meeting tomorrow to discuss the organizational plan for the silk cooperative factory. Generally, the three agencies will cooperate and divide the work. The Social Affairs Bureau will be responsible for organization and supervision. The Marketing Administration will be responsible for the export of products; China Silk will contribute more in terms of funding and will advocate for allowing private investment from outside parties at the beginning of the factory's establishment to enrich its financial strength and make it easier to manage. It is heard that the above two agencies have approved this opinion. In the future, the machinery and assets of the four factories will be valued as official shares, and the workers will voluntarily subscribe to shares as private shares. As for management, some advocate that it should be based on the principles of the cooperative, with the members' congress as the highest authority. Others think that this method is inappropriate and advocate that the board of directors should be established in accordance with the general company organizational law. These two opinions can be decided at tomorrow's meeting. Also, the profit-sharing method of the factory will be a heated discussion at tomorrow's meeting. One view advocates that profits should be shared according to the size of the shares, but the representative of the Social Affairs Bureau firmly opposes this method, believing that the purpose of the cooperative factory is to give the workers the feeling of being the "master" and that their self-esteem and responsibility must be improved to eliminate labor unrest in an invisible way. The adoption of a common corporate system in management is an unavoidable measure; therefore, in profit-sharing, the spirit of the cooperative must be maintained so that workers can obtain the greatest benefit, otherwise the word "cooperation" will be nominal and the factory will still have labor disputes. As for the compensation for outside private investment, a portion can be specifically set aside from the profits, but the percentage of workers' red envelopes should be at least 40 percent. Relevant sources pointed out that if cooperative factories can be managed well, there are four major advantages: (1) Eliminating labor unrest altogether, (2) Establishing wage standards that can be used as a reference for other state-owned and private factories, making the current disputes over the cost of living index unnecessary. (3) Due to the workers' conscious efforts, production can be increased. (4) Workers are the masters of the factory and will not be exploited, and their standard of living can be improved.

### Renyu's Loss Last Night Was a Pity. Black and White Team's Victory Was Very Risky. Xiao Huatuo's Last Throw Brought Them Back to Life. The Result Was 38 to 37, a Difference of One Point.

[Our Newspaper] The Black and White team, another strong basketball team from the Filipino Chinese community, showed their skills for the first time last night. They played against the Renyu team at the City Gymnasium at 6:30 PM. The game was not very successful, and it was thanks to Xiao Huatuo's throw in the last minute that they turned defeat into victory. The situation was very critical. The final score was 38 to 37. In the first half, Renyu took a four-point lead with a score of 22 to 18. Renyu led all the way from beginning to end, but unfortunately, they could not maintain their lead in the end, which was a great pity.

Black and White's Performance Was Not Ideal

The match was not very exciting, showing dullness and relaxation. Black and White's performance did not reach its best. Apart from Xiao Huatuo and Guo Guoye, there were no outstanding performances. The connection of shots seemed to be inferior to the beauty of the group. When the situation was critical, there was no special tactic shown to rescue the situation. Fortunately, they relied on the last throw. Their invincibility was due to luck and fate. Renyu lost many opportunities, otherwise the situation would have been set. However, the first game cannot determine the merits. Black and White will show their true strength in tomorrow's game against Zheng Lun. There were more than a thousand spectators last night.

Renyu Led by One Point But Lost

When the whistle blew to start the game, Guo Guoye of Black and White broke the basket first, and Wang Huaiting immediately responded. Wu Chengzhang's shot put Renyu ahead. Guo's shot and free throw, plus Shen Renshou's icing on the cake, led 7 to 4. Xu Zhongji scored; Wang Huaiting scored twice, and Renyu led again 10 to 8. From then on, they led all the way. At the end of the first quarter, Renyu led 12 to 10. In the second half, the two teams played a seesaw game. At the end of the first half, the guest team was behind 18 to 22. After switching sides, Renyu's momentum was still strong. Black and White relied on Xiao Huatuo and Fu Yongxin to score, chasing to 30 to 31. Wu Chengzhang scored on a free throw. In the third quarter, Renyu led 32 to 30. In the last quarter, Guo Guoye of Black and White was disqualified for committing five fouls. Renyu led 37 to 31 by three goals. At this time, there were still five minutes left. Renyu's strategy was wrong, and Black and White scored five consecutive points, chasing to 36 to 37. In the last half minute, Xiao Huatuo shot from afar and broke the basket. The bell rang loudly, and Black and White narrowly defeated Renyu 38 to 37.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] In order to promote the physical health of youth and students across the country and pay universal attention to sports, the Ministry of Education plans to implement physical standard tests for middle school students in provinces and cities across the country, so that the sports of youth and students in provinces and cities across the country can be universally developed. It is reported that it has been decided to start with Nanjing this November. The test items generally stipulate that a certain age must have a certain height and a certain weight as the standard physique, and middle school boys will be tested on running (a certain number of meters), jumping (running long jump), throwing (ball), and pull-ups (girls are exempt from the pull-up test). According to statistics from the Beijing Municipal Education Bureau, there are 28 public and private secondary schools with 15,000 to 6,000 students. If they are tested by district and held during physical education classes in each school, it will take two to three months to complete the tests. If the tests are conducted collectively, the time can be shortened, but holidays must be used. The detailed measures will be implemented in Beijing as soon as the Ministry of Education approves them in the near future.

### The Resurrection of a Dead City… Before and After the Recovery of Dongtai…

— Our Newspaper's Taixian Reporter, Ling Songshou

Dongtai News, 4th

According to the original plan of Commander Li Tianxia, Dongtai was to be recovered by the end of October; however, in reality, it happened four days earlier. This further increased his confidence in the "magic weapon" (planned operation map) he had in his pocket.

Originally, after the National Army recovered Liangduo on the 25th, the vanguard crossed Sanli'an, only thirteen li away from Dongtai City; and the left-wing troops inflicted a serious blow on the Communist army at Wushen Temple, the largest stronghold southwest of Dongtai City. It was known that the Communist army had no ability to continue resisting in Dongtai. The reason for their delay in retreating was only to prolong the time to strengthen their plundering and transportation efforts.

Doors Closed During the Day, Perfunctory Business at Night

On the 27th, the reporter was in Hai'an, and in the early morning, I was told by the head of the Army Affairs Office that Dongtai had been recovered. I immediately took a special car to Liangduo. The next morning, I followed the 83rd Division headquarters to Dongtai.

The suburbs of Dongtai City are much larger than Taixian. A single main street is a full seven li long. On the first day of arrival, the street seemed strangely deserted. Very few shops had their doors fully open, and looking at the shelves from the doorway, there were very few goods on them, some even empty, especially the silk and cloth shops. The reporter rested at an oil shop and talked with the people there. According to them, "Doing business under the Communist army's rule is not easy. They have cooperatives, and all business is subject to their control. They monopolize the good business, but if there's anything unprofitable, they immediately come to you. Clearly, the market price of beans is only 20,000 yuan per stone, but they insist on 25,000 yuan; while the oil that is pressed out is bought by them at a flat price, and they profit from reselling it." The oil shop owner asked me, "They say that merchants are an exploiting class; but what is this method of theirs towards merchants?" Because of the fluctuating "value" (?) of the "Anti-Currency," the people gradually became wary. For several months, most shops didn't want to do any business, preferring to close, but the Communist army wouldn't allow them to do so in order to promote the market. As the National Army advanced north from Hai'an, government planes frequently patrolled Dongtai, dropping leaflets. The shops used air raid precautions as an excuse, gladly keeping their doors closed during the day and doing business for only an hour or two in the evening, just to get by. Therefore, before its recovery, Dongtai had become a dead city; it only came back to life after the National Army moved in.

Traffic Gradually Resumes, Thousands of Returning Home Each Day

During the week that the reporter was in Dongtai, it was clear that Dongtai was moving towards recovery day by day. At least a thousand displaced people were returning home from other places every day; the water transport between Dongtai and Taixian had also resumed; batches of goods were being transported to Dongtai, replenishing the shelves of the shops and enriching the Dongtai market; hotels and restaurants that had not been operating during the Communist army's occupation were now reopening. The number of new shops opening and old shops reopening was increasing daily. Even shops that had not yet resumed business were either because the owners had fled and not returned, or because the goods ordered had not yet arrived; in the warm embrace of the government, they would still work hard to build a new Dongtai.

Due to the two major reasons of inconvenient transportation and lack of supplies, small stalls were very active on the streets of Dongtai. They mostly transported general retail goods from Nantong or Taixian for sale. The prices of various goods were initially very high, such as Morris cigarettes selling for 1,000 yuan a pack in Taizhou, but 1,800 yuan here. But in the last three days, as the goods gradually poured in, the average price was only about 20% higher than in Taixian. The prices of other daily necessities were assessed and implemented by the county chamber of commerce: rice at 32,000 yuan per stone, straw at 3,000 yuan per dan, pork at 1,600 yuan per catty, kerosene at 800 yuan per catty, vegetables at 30 yuan per catty, and plain boiled water at 10 yuan per bowl. The merchants and people were still able to understand the government's intentions and obeyed the orders. There was no excessive fluctuation within a week.

Not Hoarding "Anti-Currency," Not Waiting for it to Become Waste Paper

Speaking of the market, one naturally thinks of the currency problem. Not long ago, some people thought that the "Anti-Currency" left behind by the Communist army was a matter worth discussing. But based on the reporter's impressions from the recovered areas on the eastern front over the past ten days, it doesn't seem to be that serious of a matter. (Of course, this may only be the case on the eastern front; the situation in other places may be different.) The common people, oppressed by the Communist Party, had no choice but to use a currency other than the one stipulated by the government in their own country; however, they saw things very clearly. Despite the Communist Party's flowery rhetoric, they would never hoard a large amount of "Anti-Currency" at home, waiting for it to become waste paper. As for the shops, as mentioned earlier, they didn't want to do business at all. Even if they had accumulated "Anti-Currency," they had already burned it before the National Army moved in. One boss told the reporter, "As long as the National Army comes, what else matters? This small loss is better than being completely ruined by them (referring to the Communist army), isn't it?" Currently, the common difficulty in the market is the lack of legal tender. When the National Army first arrived in Dongtai, almost all transactions on the street were mainly conducted by the troops. There were hardly any transactions between Dongtai people and Dongtai people. The reporter once heard a housewife say, "I don't even have money to buy vegetables!" Although the current situation has improved a little, it is still far from being "flexible." Of course, there are various difficulties in promoting the bank, but we cannot simply watch the market of a newly recovered city become so rigid. The day before yesterday, I heard Commander Li say that if the legal tender problem cannot be solved, he is prepared to temporarily allocate some cash from the military supplies office to the county chamber of commerce for use. However, this is only an expedient measure. The main expectation is still the restoration of the banking sector.

Visiting Commissioner Zhang, Enquiring About Issues in the Recovered Area

The land problem in the recovered areas has also been discussed in the newspapers. Some advocated borrowing water to sail the boat, that is, using the recovered areas as a model to realize the initial equalization of land rights. Some advocated handling it gently, so that the people who had suffered great calamities could breathe a sigh of relief. The "Guidelines for Administration in the Pacification Zone" recently passed by the Supreme National Defense Council were formulated based on the latter. For this reason, the reporter specifically visited Commissioner Zhang of the Sixth Administrative Region to inquire about his opinion on the land problem. Commissioner Zhang believes that the above-mentioned system is very suitable for the customs and habits of the people in the recovered areas, and it truly reflects the government's care for the people's difficulties. The commissioner also believes that the land problem will not have major disputes in northern Jiangsu. First, Chinese folk customs have always been generous; especially after surviving a disaster, people sympathize with each other and will never engage in encroachment or impersonation. Second, the landlords will not have completely lost evidence of their right to the land; and northern Jiangsu is mostly composed of self-cultivating farmers, living in villages, with descendants replacing each other. The ownership of the land or its boundaries is not only very clear to the landlords, but also very clear to the neighbors. It is impossible to encroach or impersonate even if they want to.

In addition, regarding the issue of revenge by the people, the reporter consulted relevant parties for their opinions. Everyone felt that according to the nature of Chinese people to be tolerant, there would not be any revenge actions against the small number of bad elements. However, in order to prevent problems before they occur, on the negative side, the local authorities should still carry out effective propaganda and earnest exhortations to ensure mutual understanding and no disputes; on the positive side, the government should quickly establish courts in the recovered areas so that fair resolutions can be sought when disputes arise.

### The Common People Say: The Dark Days are Over; The National Army Has Brought Warmth and Light

The urban area of Dongtai City has not experienced major battles, so the surface damage is still small. However, after six years of oppression by the enemy and puppets, coupled with more than a year of trampling by the Communist army, we can easily imagine how Dongtai is now showing a strong exterior but weak interior. The destruction of the war, the reporter has passed through Fuan, Anfeng, Liangduo and other places many times. The disasters are everywhere, which is really unbearable. In the section from Qintong to Dongtai, such as the villages near Shinian and Wushen Temple, all were set on fire by the Communist army, and the residents were displaced. In addition, the Communist army also carried out large-scale killings. In the villages north of Qintong, there were more than 2,000 victims. All of this requires the government to launch relief work as soon as possible!

Following the entry of the National Army, the Dongtai Power Plant also resumed supplying power, which added a lot of vitality to Dongtai. The common people said: "The dark days are over. The National Army has brought us warmth and light!"

In order to prosper the market and stabilize the people's hearts, Commander Li is very concerned about the development of legitimate entertainment in the local area. He instructed the local administrative authorities to prepare for the establishment of theaters and cinemas, so that the people can taste a little bit of the flavor of peaceful times after the disaster. Commander Li is always so artistic and modern; on the battlefield, he cannot leave a movie camera. A few days ago, the commander invited the generals and reporters to watch the anti-Japanese war film "The Road"; on the chairman's birthday, the newsreel "Madame Chiang's Visit to the United States" was shown in public places, and the common people were all very happy. They said, "The National Army is still the National Army!" The new era drama troupe of the division headquarters, after performing "Nation Above All" and "Golden Earth" in Taixian, rushed to this coastal ancient city, ready to give a public performance of a certain drama to comfort the Dongtai people who had suffered so much.

Hundreds of Things Waiting to be Sorted Out, Expanding the Gains of Points and Lines

The recovery of Dongtai is only a gain of points and lines. At the beginning of the restoration of local administration, hundreds of things are waiting to be sorted out. Commissioner Zhang listed four major points to the reporter, namely: (1) consolidation of city defense works, (2) enrichment of local armed forces, (3) reorganization of Baojia households, and (4) strengthening of military-political cooperation. However, at the beginning of the administration, there is no shortage of economic needs. "Speaking of local finance, it is another headache." Dongtai County Magistrate Fei Jun frowned and said to the reporter: "Not to mention a myriad of things, it is not easy to collect donations and land taxes. Even if the agency is mature, please ask, in this chaos after a major war, when people are struggling to survive, is the government still embarrassed to reach out to the people for money? The provincial government subsidizes the reconstruction expenses for three months at 15 million yuan per month, but according to the current expenditure situation, the county government needs at least 60 million yuan per month. Where does it come from? Now we are trying to maintain it within the scope of credit. If we look one step ahead, it is really chilling."

This is a special feature. Almost all the party and government leaders and cadres in Dongtai are from northern Jiangsu. They serve the countryside, fought guerrillas during the Anti-Japanese War, became refugees after the victory, and are still working hard until recently when they were restored. The Commissioner's Office moved into Dongtai territory less than three days ago, and then moved again. However, after moving around, it is still a very cramped and dark old house. Commissioner Zhang smiled and said to the reporter, "We are still living a guerrilla life!"

Dongtai has been recovered! None of the people are not looking forward to governance. "A hungry person is easy to be fed, and a thirsty person is easy to be given a drink." The reporter believes that under the leadership of this group of hardworking officials in charge, Dongtai will easily restore its old appearance!

### "Traitor Bandits" and "Eighth Grandfathers": A Glimpse of the Front Line in the Northern Section of the Pinghan Railway

— Our Reporter Stationed in Peiping, Song Shaobo

Air News, 4th

Now, in the intricate areas that neither the government nor the Communist Party's armed forces can fully control, you can see how sharp the struggle is. In these areas, all that is seen is the struggle for survival. The common people are dying in groups in this struggle. Because of the Communist Party's policies, "class struggle" can be clearly seen here. Those who call the Communist Party "traitor bandits" are those whose property has been "struggled" and "liquidated" by the Communist Party. These people have no choice but to leave their homes and move their families to cities or stations controlled by the government. They are the tens of thousands of "refugees" who have turned from rich to receiving relief. However, relief can only solve the problem of survival for a while, so in the end, they form so-called "armed homecoming teams," or join the police and security forces to earn money and find their enemies—"Communist cadre"—in their hometowns to take revenge. Whenever they see them, they rarely take them back. Most of them kill their enemies on the spot (or are killed by their enemies). They are afraid that if they take them back to the county, the enemies will escape death by chance. After killing people, they take all the food of the enemies, set fire to the houses of the enemies and their own houses, and return to the county town to prepare to come again. The Baojia chiefs have the right to arrest any suspicious person. The peaceful countryside has now turned into a killing field. In the past, the death of one person would spread throughout dozens of miles of villages, but now being killed is commonplace and not surprising! The Communist Party also has its masses. According to what the reporter Er Peisun heard from the Zhuoxian Party Department, those "paupers" call the Eighth Route Army "Eighth Grandfathers." When the Eighth Route Army arrives in villages they rarely visit, the poor quickly run to the street to greet them: "Eighth Grandfathers, is it our turn to celebrate the New Year this time?" Then, under the auspices of the Eighth Route Army, the food of the richer families is divided up. If you say no, it immediately becomes a problem, and some people end up losing their lives. However, the Eighth Route Army cannot stay there forever. After the Eighth Route Army leaves, another kind of retaliatory struggle follows. Secretary Xiao said: "Today, it is necessary for us to earnestly implement the Principle of People's Livelihood. Verbal promises can only be used for a while. The second time, they will not work. We cannot solve the problem by relying solely on armed suppression." Local party and government workers are hoping that the government will have a comprehensive solution. At least the new policies in northern Jiangsu, eastern Hebei, and Chahar need to be considered comprehensively. Regarding the Communist Party's policies, according to a Catholic priest in Zhuoxian, they have become more active after the victory than before, so the opposition and vendettas in the countryside are much more severe than before. The traditional customs and habits of the countryside are changing, and the common people generally understand the struggle for survival.

Politics Cannot Keep Up with Military Affairs

Under the active activities of the Communist Party, the weakness of local politics is a matter that deserves serious consideration. Those who commanded the operations this time all lamented that politics could not keep up with military affairs. The aftermath work after the army passed through was mostly a mess. Without the cooperation of the regular army, the local armed forces could not hold on firmly, let alone expand. According to Cui Shichang, commissioner of the Sixth Administrative Region of Hebei Province, and Niu Bingxu, magistrate of Zhuoxian County, it is because the salaries of local workers are too low, so capable people do not go to the countryside or dare to go to the countryside. Under the restrictions of central laws, everything is restricted. Taking county-level salaries as an example, starting from April of this year, the province stipulates that each person's living allowance is 24,500 yuan, and the base salary is increased 77 times. The living allowance for police officers and servants is 14,700 yuan, and the base salary is only thirty or forty yuan. In terms of total income, a clerk with a monthly base salary of 100 yuan only earns 32,300 yuan, while a police officer only earns 14,700 yuan. It is not enough for one person to eat coarse grain, let alone support a family. Starting in July, the province stipulated to improve the treatment of public school personnel, allocate public grain, 80 catties of wheat per person, and increase the base salary by 160 times. Police officers were given 60 catties of wheat and increased base salary, and the living allowance was canceled and no arbitrary apportionment was allowed. As a result, after calculation, not only did it not increase, but it decreased by more than 10,000 yuan. The county police teams who have fled to other counties are even more miserable, earning less than eight or nine thousand yuan per month. If they are not allowed to find their own way, they cannot live. If they are allowed to find their own way, then only the common people will suffer. The abuses are unspeakable. Conversely, the Communist Party's county and village-level cadres not only have personal living security, but their families do not have to worry about life. Under the widespread "struggle," "liquidation," and "emancipation movement," the poor have become a new class with land and power. These people passively reduce the Communist Party's administrative concerns and actively become the Communist Party's pioneers. According to Xiao Peisun, he has not yet encountered a true Communist Party member who is willing to surrender after being captured. The government's local administrative personnel and police teams do not even have time to take care of themselves, so how can they be blamed for not fulfilling their duty to defend the territory? Therefore, of the ten counties under the jurisdiction of the Sixth Administrative Region today, Zhuoxian, Dingxing, Laishui, Xincheng, Guan, Yongqing, Shuangxian, Xinlu, Laiyang, and Yixian, the latter six are in the hands of the Communist Party, and the government only controls three or four tenths of the territory of the remaining four counties. After the years of war and the Communist army's capture of various places this time, the localities have suffered great damage, and there is no remaining strength to rebuild. If they are destroyed again, they will only perish together. However, the "face" matters still cannot be left undone, such as the Zhuoxian's "Long Live President Chiang" birthday celebration, which was to remove the original county-run central primary school sign and replace it with a new sign that said "Zhuoxian County-run Chung Cheng Elementary School."

The Commanders on the Front Line Have Not Forgotten Peace

But after the reporter returned from the front line, after careful thought, peace is still hopeful. Those commanders who commanded the operations are always concerned about the peace talks in Nanjing. The commanders standing on the front line call the rear every day to inquire about the news in the newspaper that day, and what they care most about is "How are the negotiations in Nanjing?" "Are we still going to fight?" Those young officers are not eager to talk about the civil war, but when they talk about how the Battle of Guilin was, they will very excitedly and patiently tell you about the situation of each battle. But they hate the Communist army's destructive behavior, believing that this can only eliminate the country's vitality.

The Communist Army Released Poison Gas at Beiyue Temple (Special Correspondent Hang Zhou)

### Heart of Jehol: A Bird's-Eye View of Chifeng

— Special Correspondent for Northeastern Affairs, Han Qingtao

Shenyang Air Dispatch, October 30th

Chengde, the politically significant capital of Jehol, has long been officially recovered. Chifeng, the heart of Jehol, also entered the embrace of the National Army on Double Tenth Day, and Jehol is now on the right track. To see the actual situation in Chifeng and provide a truthful report, I, the reporter, accompanied General She Yuming on an inspection trip to Jehol on the morning of October 29th, and went to the airfield.

A twin-engine transport plane left Beiling Airfield at 10 a.m., first flying southwest, skimming over Jinzhou, then turning northwest, passing Chaoyang and Jianping, crossing the Lao Ha River, and entering the Chifeng Basin.

Chifeng is the heart of Jehol, and its urban area and population exceed those of its capital, Chengde. The "Yefeng" Road, built in the 20th year of the Republic [1931], started from Yebaishou and ended here. Unfortunately, this 147-kilometer-long railway was completely destroyed by the Communist army. The rails can still be pieced together, but the sleepers were used by the Communist army for construction and firewood, and some were scattered among the people, now almost all gone.

When the plane passed between Chaoyang and Jianping, the backs of the barren mountains were covered with a layer of thin snow, dazzling and stimulating, reminding us of the cold in Chifeng. This was fully reflected here. However, upon entering the Chifeng Basin, we felt the warm sunshine, not much different from Shenyang. However, it is said that Chifeng had a snowfall a few days ago, and the temperature once dropped to four degrees below zero.

The Red Mountains Stretch Out, Chifeng Gets Its Name From This

Looking down on the basin, the fields are crisscrossed. The city of Chifeng is located in the center of the basin. The plane gradually descends, and what comes into view is the reddish-brown, towering Red Mountain. At the foot of the Red Mountain, herds of sheep are moving, and in the fields, there are many men and women collecting stalks of grain. On the highways and small roads, villagers are carrying grain into the city to sell. Several small rivers flow through the east, north, and west sides of the city of Chifeng, surrounded by mountains and rivers, it can be said to be another paradise in the barren mountains.

Red Mountain is located in the southeast of the city of Chifeng, and "Chifeng" gets its name from this. The Mongols call it "Ulan Hada," which means "Red Mountain." "Chifeng" has no city wall. Now, the brothers of the 93rd Army stationed there, along with the local people, are jointly building an earthen wall around the city, measuring 24 li. Strongholds made of stacked stones have been built in key areas of the wall to prevent unexpected disturbances.

Communist Army Retreats, Banned Goods Reach Chifeng

The plane landed at the old airfield three or four li outside the city to the south, which is no longer in use. The pilot landed safely with skilled technique. Because no telegram was sent in advance, Army Commander Lu Junquan drove to meet us on the spur of the moment. As we drove through the streets, people knew that Director Du had arrived, and all showed sincere respect on their faces.

The streets and alleys are orderly, and people's clothing is also very simple and neat. There are very few extremely ragged and malnourished people. Most of the shops are open for business, but prices are constantly rising. It is said that there are two reasons for this: one is that merchants from the Jinzhou area arrive very quickly and purchase in large quantities; the other is that after the Communist army retreated to the northern part of Udan, they restricted the transportation of materials from their controlled areas to Chifeng.

Household Registration Shifts From Anxiety to Stability

Chifeng County Magistrate Sun Ming, because he arrived later than the army, has just begun to handle everything in the county, and all work is waiting to be actively carried out. The people of Chifeng have shifted from anxiety to the right track of stability. Now, the work of organizing the household registration in the recovered townships and districts is being promoted.

According to last year's statistics, the population of the entire county is 326,319. According to the latest survey, the population of Chifeng city is divided into 65 bao, 566 jia, 9,678 households, and 43,894 people, including 23,164 males and 20,730 females.

Schools have started. Chifeng Middle School has 212 students, and there are 10 elementary schools with 1,480 students. In addition, there is a national elementary school. The political department of the 93rd Army has made many efforts to launch the resumption of classes at all levels of schools. On the 12th of this month, all schools fully resumed classes under the call of the department.

National Army Stationed, Only Then Did People Know Who the Leader Was

Slogans such as "Long live Chairman Chiang!" and "Support Director Du to stabilize the new Jehol!" are written everywhere on the walls. According to the person in charge of the army's political department, "The people of Chifeng suffered greatly under the ravages of the enemy and puppets in the past. The Communist army stayed in Chifeng for more than a year. They only knew that in addition to the Communist Party, there was also the Kuomintang, but they did not know who the leader of the Kuomintang was. After our army was stationed here, we received a lot of praise for the National Army's prestige, and at the same time, we also learned about the Founding Father and Chairman Chiang."

County Magistrate Sun said, "When the National Army first entered, some people did not dare to come forward, or some had a hedging mentality, because the Communist army was still on the outskirts, fearing that they would come back to settle accounts with them. Later, the Communist army gradually moved away, and the nearest place was more than sixty li away. At the same time, after I announced the government's policy towards the people, the main point was that everyone would have freedom in the future. Those who were forced to join the Eighth Route Army and wanted to start anew would be treated leniently by the government and would not be held accountable for the past. We hope that those who were hidden by the Communist army can awaken and will never be allowed to disrupt public order. Only then did the people settle down and express their heartfelt conviction."

"There is also a matter that makes everyone feel uneasy, and that is that people who were liquidated by the Communist army in the past now want to carry out reverse liquidation. The county government told them that the Communist army had transported all the materials away, and there was no longer any reason to argue between the rich and the poor. We hope that everyone will cooperate sincerely and restore order together, because if this is not done, local public security cannot be quickly stabilized."

Mongol and Hui Compatriots Account for One-Tenth of the Population

Mongol and Hui compatriots account for a part of the total population of Jehol. The Mongols have a long history of activity here. It is estimated that the Mongols in Chifeng account for just over 10% of the total population of Chifeng city. In the past, the personnel of the Wangfu [Prince's Mansion] are now mostly in Yebaishou, and Chifeng has an "Ongniud Right Banner Office."

According to the pseudo-Manchukuo Yearbook: "In the northern part of the province, Han and Mongol people live together. Due to the different traditions and ideologies of the two ethnic groups, or economic conflicts caused by land rights and tribute relations, it is difficult to integrate them harmoniously. Therefore, in the same area where Han and Mongol people live, it is necessary to implement a banner system for Mongols. However, in September of the sixth year of Kangde [1939], the Mongolian princes voluntarily gave up their inherent privileges, and thus the dual administrative system of counties and banners, which had hindered the promotion of provincial administration for many years, was integrated into a unified system."

It is said that the Mongol compatriots here are now planning to form some kind of their own organization, which may repeat the chaos of the past county and banner system. The Hui compatriots account for more than 20% of the total population of the city, mostly as beef and mutton vendors or running small restaurants. It is said that in the past, because of cultural backwardness, they were easily instigated, and there were often frictions with the Han compatriots. In the future, if politics can get on the right track, of course, all problems can be solved.

Parts Taken Away, Restoration of Power Generation Still Awaits

In many border areas, the people are mostly tough. Also, because this is a tobacco-producing area, there are many drug addicts.

Chifeng's export products include fur, livestock, wheat, and sorghum, which are mostly transported to Jinzhou and Shenyang. The prices of general daily necessities are lower than in Shenyang. Pork is 60 yuan per catty in circulation coupons, beef is 50 yuan per catty, mutton is 55 yuan per catty, white flour is 50 yuan per catty, buckwheat is 25 yuan per catty, sorghum rice is 16 yuan per catty, millet is 15 yuan per catty, eggs are 10 yuan per catty, and a small box of Philip Morris cigarettes is 130 yuan.

There is a thermal power plant that supplies more than 7,000 households with electricity. When the Communist army left, they took away small machines and scattered parts, so that power generation cannot be restored yet. The telecommunications bureau also encountered the same fate, thus creating Chifeng's dark and stagnant phenomenon.

Lightly Equipped, General Du's Determination and Amiability

General Du Yuming stayed in Chifeng for more than three hours. In addition to listening to military reports and giving instructions, he encouraged the responsible persons of the county government and party and government organs, as well as Mongol and Hui compatriots, to work together to build a new Chifeng.

At 3:20 p.m., the reporter rushed to the large airfield nine li outside the western suburbs. With a few horn blasts, the propeller started, and the plane quickly took off, bidding farewell to Chifeng. On the return journey, we took a direct flight route over Fuxin and returned to Shenyang at 4:50 p.m.

General Du traveled lightly, with only one adjutant, and the rest were six journalists. General Du's determination, vigilance, amiability, and approachability were the common impressions of our group of reporters.

Xi'an Air Dispatch, 4th

In Jiangnan, we often encounter the weather of "one rain turning into autumn," but in the Northwest, it becomes "one rain turning into winter"! I remember that on the day when the national snow line for this winter exceeded Dihua and Lanzhou last month, Chang'an had a cold rain, and the temperature dropped significantly from then on. A week ago, the snow line crossed Zhiyang again and "entered the pass," and Chang'an also had a cold rain, and the people in the city began to wear cotton-padded jackets and fur robes. On that day, the farmers in the south of the city said: Zhongnan Mountain (one of the remaining veins of the Qinling Mountains, its northern foot is Chang'an) has already put on a snow-white hat!

Speaking of cold and snow, we naturally think of cotton, as white as snow. The importance of cotton in Shaanxi may be greater than many people imagine. Not long ago, the Sino-American Agricultural Cooperation Group came to Shaanxi for investigation, and the relevant departments here provided the following proud figures: "Starting from the 30th year of the Republic [1941], the government began to collect cotton fields nationwide (that is, to pay land tax with cotton in kind), which was actually mainly relied on Shaanxi. In the 34th year of the Republic [1945], Shaanxi accounted for 100% of the total national cotton tax..." Although we are sorry for the soldiers who fought in the war and were unable to eat or dress warmly, the people of Shaanxi can truly say without shame: The cotton yarn and cotton cloth worn by the brothers were all dedicated to the government by the cotton farmers of Shaanxi without receiving a penny, except for the military supplies purchased with money by the military supply department. Even the military cotton purchased by the government, Shaanxi cotton accounted for the first place in quantity!

After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the cotton-producing areas in North China and Central China were gradually recovered. However, the importance of Shaanxi cotton has not been reduced. According to this year's national cotton production forecast, the total harvest is 5 million dan (that is, 50 kilograms, the same below), of which Shaanxi accounts for one-ninth, or 550,000 dan. By province, Shaanxi ranks fourth, second only to Hubei, Hebei, and Jiangsu. However, it is doubtful whether the three provinces of Zheng, Ji, and Su will actually reach the expected figures this year due to the war.

I also found statistics on world cotton production in books. From 1935 to 1939, the average annual output was 7 billion kilograms, of which 3 billion kilograms of American cotton accounted for almost half, and 600 million kilograms of Chinese cotton accounted for about one-eleventh of the total. What proportion did Shaanxi cotton account for at that time? According to the records of the Eastern Province: From 1934 to 1940, the average annual output of Shaanxi cotton was 52.5 million kilograms (Note: These seven years were also the "golden age" of Shaanxi cotton in the 25 years since records began!). In other words, during the above-mentioned period, only Shaanxi Province (more precisely, only the cotton fields in the "Jingwei area" of Guanzhong) accounted for one-eleventh of the national cotton production and one-hundred-and-thirtieth of the world cotton production!

From the two figures listed above, careful readers will surely see that the annual average output of Shaanxi cotton between six and twelve years ago was more than double this year's output. Yes, since 1940, when cotton was cheap and wheat and rice were expensive, many farmland were converted to food crops, the output of Shaanxi cotton began to decrease. The smallest year was 1942, when the harvest of 15 million kilograms of cotton was only one-third of the "golden age" of Shaanxi cotton. Fortunately, there has been an increase in the past four years, and this year's harvest has increased by almost one-tenth compared to last year's 25 million kilograms.

Looking at the records of the history of Shaanxi's cotton industry over the past ten years, we should know that the rise or fall of local cotton prices always stimulates or suppresses the total area of cotton fields and the total output of cotton. According to the records of the price ratio between cotton and wheat in Xi'an City over the past ten years, cotton was the most expensive in the summer and autumn of 1940, when one catty of cotton could be exchanged for more than seven catties of wheat, and this year was also the last year of the "golden age" for cotton farmers. Afterwards, cotton prices never caught up with grain prices, and cotton production followed, sharply decreasing from 1941 onwards. Cotton was the cheapest in the winter of 1941, when one catty of cotton could not be exchanged for three catties of wheat. On the eve of Japan's surrender in early August last year, it was even as low as only two catties of wheat. At the end of September this year, the price of cotton fell by another three-quarters! Later, prices rose again from stability, and although cotton was no exception, the profits were returned to the pockets of cotton merchants, because most cotton farmers had already been forced to sell to cotton merchants at the end of autumn and the beginning of winter, regardless of price. This year's cotton price is much better than last year's. The current market situation is that one catty of cotton can be exchanged for four and a half catties of wheat, and the land tax on cotton fields this year is levied on grain instead of cotton, so cotton farmers can finally take a breather. (The above prices are all based on wholesale prices)

Next, let's talk about the "quality" of Shaanxi cotton. Although the "quality" of cotton includes many items in agronomy, the main thing from an application (textile) perspective is to look at the length of the cotton fiber. Because too short cotton fibers can only be spun into coarse yarn of 10 to 16 counts, and the tensile strength is not enough, so it can only be woven into coarse cloth. The main use of Shaanxi cotton during the Anti-Japanese War was to spin coarse yarn of 16 counts for military uniforms, so most of the yarn factories here also focused on 16-count yarn. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Shanghai cloth and foreign cloth were continuously transported westward to Shaanxi, and the textile industry in Shaanxi Province began to use Shaanxi cotton to spin a large amount of 20-count yarn. If you want to make it finer, the problem does not lie in the quality of Shaanxi cotton, but in the equipment and technology of the yarn factories in Shaanxi Province. It is said that state-owned and private yarn factories in Shanghai have used Shaanxi cotton as experimental materials, and the results can spin up to 32-count fine yarn, in other words, it is enough to weave commonly used fine cloth with surplus.

Today, whether viewed from the perspective of quality or quantity, Shaanxi cotton obviously still has room for "further development," but its current achievements are not achieved by chance overnight. This example may be a good reference for agricultural experts.

First, let's talk about the limiting conditions for cotton-producing areas. As is well known, Shaanxi is a province that is narrow from east to west and long from north to south. From a natural geographical point of view, it can be divided into three regions: Northern Shaanxi, Guanzhong, and Southern Shaanxi. The former belongs to the Loess Plateau, and water is lacking. It is better to develop it into a pastoral area. Only the latter two, namely the Weihe and Hanshui Basins, are fully equipped with farming conditions. According to the conclusion of Mr. Li Guozhen, a researcher of Shaanxi cotton: "Not only latitude restricts the regional boundaries of cotton-producing areas, but also altitude, terrain, rainfall, temperature... etc., are all equally important factors." From this, we can know that there are reasons why the cotton-producing area of Shaanxi Province is concentrated in Guanzhong today, and why Northern Shaanxi, which is more south than the cotton-producing area of Zhengding and other counties in Hebei Province, is not suitable for cotton planting. Currently, cotton fields in Guanzhong account for 90% of the cotton area in Shaanxi Province, Southern Shaanxi accounts for 8%, and Northern Shaanxi only accounts for 2%. If Guanzhong area is divided in detail, it can be divided into five areas: the Yellow River area, the eastern part of the province, the "Jinghui Canal" benefit area, the area near the provincial capital, and other areas. The "Jingwei area" is currently a major cotton-producing area.

It is obvious that under the guidance of the Shaanxi Provincial Agricultural Improvement Institute (where Mr. Li Guozhen serves as the director) for many years, the quality and yield per mu of cotton have made amazing progress. To be more precise, I still have to go back to the Shaanxi Provincial Cotton Experiment Farm in 1924, which first started to improve cotton, and the Agricultural Improvement Institute, which focused on improving the varieties of Shaanxi cotton from 1934 onwards. After twenty-two years of continuous efforts like one day, we have today's achievements, "Rome was not built in a day"!

Currently, the best-performing varieties in this province are "Sizi No. 4" and "Dezi" cotton, both of which are American varieties. "Sizi No. 4" performs the best. The cotton fiber length reaches 29 mm, and the highest harvest record has exceeded the ordinary Shaanxi varieties by 68.8%. From this, we can know how important it is to improve seeds. "Sizi" cotton has been "settled" in Shaanxi for more than ten years. The cotton farmers in the Guanzhong area trust it very much, but the knowledge of agriculture is still backward, so how to maintain the purity and excellent performance of the seeds is an important topic in the "Shaanxi Provincial Cotton Production Quality Improvement Symposium."

Relevant parties are planning to grade the quality of cotton. They seem to want to evaluate the grades of cotton before it is massively launched on the market through organizations such as farmers' associations in various places, just like Shanghai's inspection of raw silk. The implementation of this plan will inevitably encounter difficulties at first, but the beneficiaries will still be cotton farmers in the future, because after the scientific inspection of cotton, they will understand whether their products are better or worse than others, so they will strive to improve them in order to "upgrade" their products. A greater significance is to ensure the quality of each level, so that buyers can use them with confidence, and over time, the confidence of customers will naturally increase.

Some people were worried about the future of this year's 550,000 dan of new cotton, because military cotton is no longer needed in large quantities, and the government no longer collects in kind. But now it seems that this is just "worrying about the sky." Taking "China Textile" alone, it has already started purchasing more than 200,000 dan in Shaanxi, and other local textile factories have also been purchasing new cotton one after another. Sales and prices are not a problem. The only problem is whether transportation can be smoother. We hope that excessive freight will not be added to cheap Shaanxi cotton (the current wholesale price of net cotton is about 1,100 to 1,200 yuan per catty), so that it cannot resist the dumping of American cotton, Indian cotton, and Brazilian cotton, which account for the first place in imports.

The situation of Shaanxi cotton is good, and the rural economy of Shaanxi is of course also good. It can even be said that if Shaanxi cotton sells well, the sales of Shanghai cotton cloth transported in will also be good, because the purchasing power of rural areas has increased. Shaanxi cotton is only "traveling" to Shanghai once, but by making such a circle, both the old Shaanxi farmers and the Shanghai yarn factory female workers benefit.

### Debates on Constitutionalism

— Traditional First

By Jin Liangben, Youth Publishing House

The Republic of China has been established for thirty-five years. The lack of a comprehensive constitutionalism that is adhered to nationwide has led to the shaking of the national foundation and frequent wars, which everyone knows is a great regret. The National Assembly, which the entire nation yearns for, has been postponed five times due to factual and environmental relations. Just a few days ago, the government explicitly announced that it would be convened on November 12th of this year. Now, the deadline has been extended by three days to allow all parties and factions to submit representative lists. The Chinese constitutionalism issue, which has been debated for decades, may finally be resolved, comforting the nationwide eager anticipation. Mr. Jin Liangben's book takes an objective stance and provides a precise and fair response to the various theoretical criticisms of the "May 5th Draft Constitution." In today's world of confused thoughts and unclear right and wrong, it is worth reading, especially for the National Assembly representatives who bear the responsibility of drafting the constitution, who should each have a copy.

This book consists of five chapters. The first chapter is an introduction, with the first section describing the introduction of the constitutionalism issue. The second section discusses the concept of the constitution, dividing it into formal and substantive aspects. The third section discusses the relationship between the constitution and democratic politics.

As for the second chapter, "The Debates and Criticisms of Various Parties Regarding the Implementation of Constitutionalism During the War," we believe that the circumstances have changed, and there is no need for lengthy discussion. The fourth chapter discusses the Kuomintang's attitude towards the constitutionalism issue. The first section discusses the Kuomintang's theoretical advocacy for constitutionalism, citing Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings. It thoroughly examines the Kuomintang's advocacy for civil rights, constitutionalism, and the implementation of constitutionalism, as well as its commitment to the spirit of political tutelage. The second section discusses the Kuomintang's historical struggle for constitutionalism. There is no need to say much about it. The most brilliant discussion is in the third section, "The Debates and Criticisms of the May 5th Draft Constitution." Unfortunately, due to space limitations, we cannot introduce it in detail, so we can only excerpt a little, allowing readers to get a glimpse.

The first section of the third chapter discusses the principle of national self-determination. It supports the original draft constitution's statement that "all ethnic groups in the Republic of China are members of the Chinese nation, and all are equal." It repeatedly clarifies the differences between the Three People's Principles constitution and the Soviet socialist constitution, citing Soviet examples and addressing those who propose the "three principles of national self-determination." Therefore, national self-determination has its conditions. First, it should be built on the condition of mutual assistance. … Second, it should not harm national unity as its highest principle. … However, Article 30 of the Soviet Constitution ensures that some ethnic minorities, like other ethnic groups, obtain an equal voice in the central government. … This intention is worth our reference.

The second section discusses the issue of restricting the people's freedom and rights according to law. It cites recent academic theories and opposes the "absolute theory of people's rights" and individual liberalism. The author cites examples from the constitutions of various countries, such as the German Weimar Constitution, the Mexican Constitution, and the Soviet Constitution, proving that the slight restrictions on the people's freedom and rights in the May 5th Draft Constitution are not problematic in principle.

National Assembly Representatives

The third section discusses the issue of the National Assembly, National Representatives, and the National Political Council. Regarding (1) the powers and duration of the National Assembly, it advocates that the powers of the current assembly should comply with the National Assembly Organization Law promulgated and revised in 1937. "The reason is that the constitution itself should stipulate which body exercises the constitution's power. If the National Assembly, which is organized to draft the constitution, exercises the powers conferred by the constitution according to the Organization Law, it is tantamount to deciding the issues that the constitution should decide with the Organization Law, limiting the power of the constitutional body with the Organization Law, predetermining the content of the constitution, and submitting it to the constitution-making body in advance." Regarding the duration of the assembly, it supports Mr. Sun Zhe-sheng's proposal to change the National Assembly from once every three years to once every year. (2) The issue of National Assembly representatives: After refuting the proposal to re-elect all National Assembly representatives based on legal principles, it discusses the central government's instructions: "The National Assembly Organization Law and the National Representative Election Law have been solemnly promulgated by the National Government in accordance with legislative procedures and implemented by the National Government. The representatives elected in accordance with the Election Law, "except for those who are found to be traitors and should be dealt with by the government according to law, should all be valid." This is very reasonable. However, it expresses great dissatisfaction with the National Assembly Representative Election Law, saying, "It is extremely controlled and violates the original theory of the election system. … It is hoped that the government authorities will make immediate remedies." Now, according to the agreement of the Political Consultative Conference, the number of National Assembly representatives has been greatly expanded, which may slightly remedy the shortcomings of the election law. (3) The issue of establishing a National Political Council, which was proposed by Zhang Junmai and others, is somewhat similar to the idea of organizing a standing committee during the adjournment of the National Assembly proposed by He Sijing and others. Organizations like the standing committee were ultimately abolished because they violated the spirit of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's five-power constitution, even though they had passed three readings in the initial draft of the constitution. The powers of the National Political Council are even broader, "not only encompassing political power but also governing power." This violates the spirit of the five-power constitution.

Presidential Powers

The fourth section discusses the issue of presidential powers. Some believe that the provisions for presidential powers in the draft constitution are too broad and should be revised. Others believe that the president should control all governing power, i.e., strengthen executive power. It disagrees with both views. It clearly states: "If more than half of the provinces in the country have not reached the beginning of the constitutional period, and the National Assembly is convened and the constitution is promulgated, then the exercise of the powers of the National Assembly convened under this constitution cannot be compared with the exercise of the powers of the National Assembly convened after more than half of the provinces in the country have reached the beginning of the constitutional period. At a minimum, the latter's exercise of powers should be broader and more thorough than the former's exercise of powers. … Now that more than half of the provinces in the country have not reached the beginning of the constitutional period, … convening the assembly and promulgating the constitution, its exercise of the powers of the National Assembly, the right to elect does not extend to the vice presidents of the Executive, Judicial, and Examination Yuan; the right to recall does not extend to the president and vice president of the Executive Yuan. In other words, the president has the power to appoint and dismiss the president of the Executive Yuan and the power to appoint the presidents and vice presidents of the Judicial and Examination Yuan. Is there anything worthy of criticism? If, therefore, it is believed that the president's powers are too broad, it is even more unnecessary. To be honest, the current provisions regarding the president's powers in the draft constitution are merely adopting a responsible presidential system. Therefore, this provision in the draft constitution can be said to be in line with the original intention of the Founding Program." This argument has considerable merit in light of the current situation, but the constitution is not like ordinary law; it is more permanent and cannot be easily changed. Even though more than half of the provinces have not reached the beginning of the constitutional period now, does that mean they will never reach the beginning of the constitutional period?

Central and Local

All the theories in this book are entirely based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings. "The Founding Program is the last and greatest work of the Founding Father; Article 24 of the Founding Program clearly stipulates that after the constitution is promulgated, the central governing power shall be exercised by the National Assembly; that is, the National Assembly has the right to elect and recall central government officials and the right to initiate and veto laws. Since it says "central government officials" without distinction, it is clear that the presidents of all the Yuan are included. Now, the draft constitution assigns the power to appoint and dismiss the president of the Executive Yuan and the power to appoint the presidents of the Judicial and Examination Yuan to the president, rather than the National Assembly. This is clearly in conflict with the Founding Program personally drafted by Dr. Sun Yat-sen. Why insist on defending it? Why not advocate following the Founding Program? If it is believed to hinder the responsible presidential system, is not the presidential system in the five-power constitution the creation of the Founding Program? Even if we want to thoroughly implement the responsible presidential system, we believe that the appointment of the presidents and vice presidents of the Executive, Judicial, and Examination Yuan should at least be changed to being nominated by the president and submitted to the National Assembly for approval. This should not violate the original intention of the separation of five powers. As for the argument to strengthen executive power and have the president control all governing power, those who cannot even distinguish between governing power and executive power are simply not worth arguing with.

The fifth section discusses the issue of adding a chapter on "Central and Local Government." Its conclusion is: "(1) The powers of the central and local governments are not based on a system of separation of powers but on a system of balanced powers; it should not list the powers of the central government, leaving the unlisted to the local governments; it should list the powers of the local governments, leaving the unlisted to the central government."

The author advocates retaining the original plan for the sixth section on the national economy and the seventh section on education. The defenses are quite insightful.

In summary, this book can be said to be a response to the "May 5th Draft Constitution" and a loyal supporter of the Three People's Principles and the Five-Power Constitution. Except for admitting that a chapter on central and local government should be added and supplementing the text of the chapter on education, it believes that all articles in the draft constitution do not need to be amended. Although there are some far-fetched points, such as the issue of presidential powers, which I have already criticized above. Also, saying that "party rule is necessarily democratic" is also very problematic. But in general, it stands on the position of the Three People's Principles and the Five-Power Constitution to criticize the various criticisms of the May 5th Draft Constitution, which can be considered very objective and fair.

### A Pictorial History of World War II

— Upright

Compiled and written by Shu Zongqiao, published by United Pictorial

I have read several Chinese versions of the history of World War II, and I feel that there are problems with their content and style. The materials are not complete, especially regarding the part about China's resistance war, which is either completely ignored or too brief. It seems to have overlooked China's eight-year resistance war and fourteen-year arduous struggle in the place it should have in World War II. Furthermore, there are no complete photos and maps to dominate the evolution of military, political, and diplomatic events during the war, making it increasingly boring and greatly reducing the interest in reading. In terms of style, the stance and organization cannot balance the various resistance forces. I have also read a history of the Great War written by an American and a pictorial history of the Great War written by a Briton. The former has detailed text and abundant maps, but it ignores many war situations on the Chinese battlefield and does not provide a relaxed and enjoyable reading experience with any war photos. The latter has a good combination of text, maps, and photos, and the narration is detailed enough. After all, the compilers are worthy of being Anglo-Saxons and use "white eyes" to observe our country's position in the Great War and invisibly reduce many of our country's heroic resistance deeds. It is disappointing after reading.

It is really not easy to write a war history that takes a firm, fair, and faithful stand without mixing in any political colors or propaganda, because we cannot easily read a true war history that is not arrogant or wronged. In addition, due to the limitations of our country's material conditions, it is really not easy to write a pictorial history that does not have the above shortcomings and is suitable for the taste of the Chinese people.

The Pictorial History of World War II, compiled and written by Shu Zongqiao, has recently been published. From the content and style, although it is difficult to achieve perfection, it can be said that the emergence of this pictorial history is a pioneer in the pictorial history world due to the compiler's more than ten years of experience in news work in the front and rear and the large amount of data provided by the US News Agency to United Pictorial during the war. From the perspective of the amount of photos, the selection of some photos from the large number of photos collected by United Pictorial during the eight years of resistance war can be called the essence of the photos, which can't be considered anything less than a major success for the compiler. Among them, eight color pictures are a unique feature of the pictures. Photos that are not easily seen outside include the Chongqing Tunnel Disaster, the fire net in the sky over Sicily, the tragic scene of Berlin after the war, London, New York, Chongqing, Moscow, Shanghai celebrating victory, which are realistic and vivid, and are quite valuable. Furthermore, Stalin and Matsuoka Yosuke hooking arms, Puyi ascending the throne, and Mussolini hanging upside down in Milan are even more historically ironic.

The book has 400 pages and 400,000 words. Its greatest feature is that the part about China's resistance war is particularly detailed, accounting for about one-third of the book, which is rare in the various war histories published at home and abroad. The book narrates all the battles and campaigns on each battlefield, regardless of size or duration, in detail. In addition to vivid photos as evidence, the text also includes detailed diagrams of the military situation evolution of each battlefield and an appendix of 70 major documents between international organizations and Allied and Axis powers, plus the documents of the Paris Peace Conference, which is currently being held. Therefore, the book is extremely helpful for civic education materials, historical and geographical common sense, and thematic research. Moreover, the compiler treats the various resistance forces in our country equally, without bias, and his fair and broad spirit can be regarded as a guide for later compilers of war history. However, it is hoped that future improvements can be made in printing and paper quality.

### The Post-War World Colonial Issue

— Naya

Shi Xiaochong's "The Post-War World Colonial Issue," New China Publishing House, first edition in August 1946

Regarding the post-war world, strong countries are known to everyone; and those colonies are equally important. We should have a full understanding of this issue. However, not many people pay attention to it.

Because disputes between strong countries are often caused by colonial issues, to understand the international situation, one must first understand the colonial issue, and from this, one can further understand the relationships and situations between countries.

This book, "The Post-War World Colonial Issue," discusses the current stage of the world's colonial issues.

First, it lists the area and population of the colonies occupied by the three countries of Britain, France, and Germany in the 19th century; and compares the percentage of colonies occupied by European powers.

From this, it describes the independence movements in various colonies in the twenty years after World War I, such as: India, Korea, Vietnam, Egypt, Morocco, and other countries. The book briefly states the beginning and end of their movements and their results.

Next, it discusses the dynamics of the world's colonies during World War II; and then discusses the dynamics of the various colonies after the war and the current situation of their demands for independence.

Under these topics, the author uses materials from various sources to fully explain, so that after reading, one can clearly understand the current world colonial issue.

Finally, the author also makes a prospect for the world's colonies, hoping that each colony will be able to survive freely as soon as possible.

I will not elaborate further. In short, this book tells us some new world knowledge. It is worth reading for people from all walks of life!

### An Englishman's Impression of China

— Shaw

Published by Macmillan Company of America in 1946, 217 pages, priced at US$2.75. Author: Richard P. Dobson. The original title of the book is China Cycle, which can be translated as "Impressions of China."

There are many books written by foreigners about China, but too many of them are biased. In general, foreigners do not understand China and have very limited knowledge of China. On the one hand, we should do our best to publicize, and at the same time, we cannot ignore foreign accounts of China. There is very little news about China in American newspapers. At most, there is a short telegram every two or three days. Its position is often very inconspicuous. This is what the compatriots in the United States feel most annoyed about.

The author of Impressions of China is a young Englishman who came to China in 1936 on behalf of the British American Tobacco Company to sell goods. He traveled to many places in China and developed a good impression of the Chinese people. In 1941, he joined the British Royal Air Force as a pilot. He does not consider himself a thinker, and he does not have any amazing writing, but there is one most valuable aspect, that is, he is not interested in politics and does not have national prejudices. From his lack of political motives, he discovered and believed that China is a great country, and although it is currently in deep trouble, its future is unlimited.

Although he loves China very much, his racial prejudices are difficult to remove. For example, he opposes the deterioration of relations between Britain and Germany because this harms Western unity and benefits the East. He attacks Portugal's compromise with the East. He also praises his German friends, such as their loyalty to the country. But he is extremely dissatisfied with the French, and he considers Americans to be frivolous and naive. He has no criticism of Russia.

Although Mr. Dobson has these prejudices and some mistakes, his sincerity and his humility, his willingness to learn, and his acceptance of others' opinions make his prejudices unimportant. He expresses deep sympathy for China, which shows his sincere intention. No wonder Richard Watts said when reviewing this book, "After reading this book, you feel that the author is a very approachable friend, very suitable for traveling with you in China."

The author praises Chongqing very much, not only because he believes that it has a geographical advantage, but also because he believes that it is sufficient to represent the vitality and energy of the Chinese people. However, he made a mistake in the population figure, doubling it. However, these are minor flaws and are not worth emphasizing.

However, the author can see many shortcomings in the character of the Chinese people and the country, and he points them out without hesitation. He points out poverty, disease, and corruption. He also points out the lack of responsibility on the part of conscription and officials. These shortcomings are not enough to shake his confidence in the Chinese people. He believes that the Chinese people have unlimited vitality and an indomitable spirit. The Chinese people have these virtues, which are the raw materials for creating a great country. He believes that China has the largest population and the most history, and once politics is on track, China's future is unlimited, and no force can stop this. And in this respect, no other nation in the world can surpass China.

We are very grateful for the hope that Dobson has for China. All Chinese people should work hard in this direction. Whenever foreigners come to China, they always mention corruption, as if corruption is inseparable from China. Some pamphlets issued by the U.S. military also have special columns telling new American soldiers in China that everyone in China is "oiling" (taking bribes). If you ask a friend to buy something, if he is a good person, he will only take a 10% commission. This kind of misconception is of course an insult to China. However, if there were no large-scale corruption phenomena in our country, how could we give foreigners this impression? Generally speaking, foreigners have sympathy and hope for China. Once our country's politics is on track, it will undoubtedly be the strongest country in the world, and compatriots living abroad can also breathe a sigh of relief.

### Suggestion to the Academia Sinica to Establish a Special Problems Research Institute

— Xu Zhongnian

From October 20th to 25th, the second session of the third council meeting of the Academia Sinica was held in the thirty-fifth year of the Republic of China. In his address, Chairman Jiang stated, "Without science, there is no national defense." On October 31st, Chairman Jiang's sixtieth birthday, the Ministry of Education stipulated that from that day until October of the following year, it would be designated as "The Year of Promoting Education to Celebrate Longevity." These two grand events each had their own merits, but they stirred a small feeling within me.

"Without science, there is no national defense" is a self-evident and unquestionable truth. However, China has been advocating science for many years. While we do not deny that China's science has made considerable progress, we must also admit that China's scientific progress is too slow, far from comparable to advanced countries! Today, we can almost say that China relies on the science of others for its national defense. This is an extremely abnormal and dangerous phenomenon! The formation of this phenomenon is, of course, due to a poor academic environment - at present, Chinese intellectuals face the intersection of "academics" and "hunger and cold," where survival itself is a problem, let alone academics? - but also due to a lack of scientific spirit.

What is scientific spirit? Descartes' "Discourse on Method": (1) Do not accept anything as true that you do not clearly recognize as such; (2) Divide each of the difficulties under examination into as many parts as possible, and as might be necessary for its adequate solution; (3) Conduct your thoughts in such order that, by commencing with objects the simplest and easiest to know, you may ascend little by little, and, as it were, step by step, to the knowledge of the more complex; and (4) In every case institute complete enumerations, and general reviews, as to be assured that nothing was omitted. This method is naturally the scientific method, and its basis and development are the scientific spirit. To put it more succinctly, the so-called scientific spirit is the ancient saying, "To know when you know, and to know when you do not know: this is knowledge."

The slow progress of Chinese science also suffers from pedantry. Old-fashioned literati have old-fashioned pedantry: "Chinese learning as the foundation, Western learning for application: Chinese culture should not be underestimated!" New-style literati have new-style pedantry: "China has no science at all. What is Chinese science? It's superstition, it's just grandma's tales!" Both err on the side of "bias" and are incompatible with science, being foolish, childish, and laughable! They commit a common ailment: "Self-satisfaction upon acquiring a little knowledge, ashamed to ask questions!"

They do not know that in these "superstitions" and "grandma's tales," there are many problems worth our research. We should extensively absorb foreign science and, at the same time, extract the essence from these "superstitions" and "grandma's tales" and combine them with authentic science to open up new avenues. Graduates with doctoral, master's, and bachelor's degrees often look down on these "superstitions" and "grandma's tales," not even deigning to ask about them, let alone research them! What is the result? "To be ignorant of one thing is the shame of a Confucian scholar": we only see that they are not "broad," not "learned," not "scholarly," and not "gentlemanly"! Below, I will give a few examples to prove that "superstition" or "grandma's tales" are not purely without research value.

The first example: Driving corpses. In the mountainous provinces of the southwest, there is a peculiar method of transporting corpses called "driving corpses." The Chinese concept of home is extremely strong: "A tree may grow a thousand feet tall, but its leaves fall back to its roots." The coffin of a person who dies away from home must be transported back to their hometown for burial. However, what if one encounters towering mountains and steep ridges, where even the living find it difficult to walk, let alone transport a coffin? What to do? So, sorcerers come to solicit business: they work in pairs, wearing half-red, half-green clothing, carrying water-fire sticks, one leading and one following, with five to seven masked corpses in between. They chant incantations, and the corpses obediently walk in single file, not acting strangely or decaying, until they reach the home of each corpse, where they lie down horizontally to be placed in coffins. You say, "This is a myth!" It just so happens that this was told to me by two scientific doctors who "witnessed" this event. They would never lie, nor would they need to lie.

The second example: Chenzhou Talismans. In the autumn of the twenty-sixth year of the Republic of China, I first arrived in Chongqing. At that time, Shangqingsi was quite desolate, with only flat houses. One day, I walked past a certain house and saw a large yellow paper poster pasted at the door, with the three characters "Chenzhou Talisman" written on it. The door was open, and in the middle of the hall, there was a paper figure cut out of yellow paper, kneeling on one knee, holding a porcelain basin full of water in its hand. I walked past, then walked back. The person sitting in the hall smiled at me and said, "Don't believe it?" I also smiled and replied, "I don't believe it! Can I try it?" "Of course!" I pinched the paper figure, and it was indeed paper, with no steel wire or anything like that inside. I tapped the basin, and it made a clear sound. I dipped two fingers into the water, and when I pulled them out, they were dripping wet, it really was water! In the end, I was baffled!

The third example: DunJia. This is what I saw in Hankou in July of this year. A fortune-teller was standing, not sitting, and there was no table. He simply placed a square of oilcloth on the sidewalk, with the "Eight Trigrams" and "Taijitu" painted on the cloth. A small yellow paper package was placed in the center of the "Taijitu." A mid-level civil servant walked by, glanced at it, and stopped to ask the fortune-teller to tell his fortune. The fortune-teller handed him a piece of white paper (note the color) and a pencil, saying, "Don't speak! But write down your age, eight characters, family members, and what you want to ask, one by one, fold the paper, and don't tell me. Then I will open this small yellow paper seal for you to see: if what is written on the two papers is the same, then it is effective, and you can ask further; if it is different, then it is not, and you can go on your way without spending half a penny!" Then the writer wrote himself, and the fortune-teller cast the talisman himself. The result of opening and viewing was that what was written on the yellow and white papers was the same! You say, "The two colluded to cheat!" It's possible, but being effective only works once; if it's not effective the second time, he doesn't charge a penny. Wouldn't he starve?

There are many more strange things like this! I could very well follow the fashion and say lightly, "This is superstition!" But my conscience is uneasy because this is not a question of "superstition" or not "superstition," but a matter of "not understanding" through and through! Since one does not understand, one should not make rash judgments but should thoroughly research to seek "understanding": this is the scientific spirit.

However, on the one hand, thorough research takes much time and money; on the other hand, this kind of magic is passed on to sons but not to daughters, solely to preserve secrets and protect the rice bowl. If we want to learn, we must first solve the teacher's livelihood problems. Thirdly, this type of research necessarily involves a wide range of fields, including physics, chemistry, biology, botany, folklore, society, history, geography, and religion, all of which are closely related: therefore, one person's energy and financial resources are not enough, and there must be a huge academic group as a backing.

Perhaps some people think these are not urgent matters. Excuse me, I want to scoff at that! Fifty years ago, if a visionary had described to us the rockets, missiles, radars, televisions, atomic bombs, and cosmic rays of fifty years later, would we not have laughed at him for daydreaming? Moreover, the research objects are not limited to the above three examples. The person in charge of this research does not have to be a scientist himself—he will never be an all-around doctor—but he must have broad common sense, a strong desire for knowledge, and especially a full scientific spirit, as well as real scientists as assistants.

I suggest to the Academia Sinica to establish a "Special Problems Research Institute."

Shanghai; Wednesday, October 30th, thirty-fifth year, evening.

### Mountain City Sketches

Violets

When the sun is still hidden behind the thick fog, the small crossroads of the farm are wet, as if there had been a heavy rain last night. Water droplets drip from the grapevines, and the faint sound of water droplets falling on dry leaves can be heard here and there. The weak and powerless chrysanthemums droop their fluffy heads, some even intertwining their necks and sprawling on the ground. The orange trees and Podocarpus are bathed in the fog, their leaves even greener. The short and fat agave arrogantly spreads its thorny leaves to bear the fog, just like a brave warrior exposing his prickly chest to cool off on a summer night.

Fog, fog everywhere. Heavy...

In the nursery, the violets are only a little over two inches tall. Last Sunday, when I came to see them, their slender stems were supporting a few half-unfolded tender leaves. It's still like that now. It seems to have been frightened by the weather of this early winter and dare not grow any taller. But the old gardener said that he expects it to bloom purple flowers in the spring. Now is the time when trees shed all their leaves (the peach trees, poplars, and phoenix trees are all left with bare branches). From time to time at night, cold winds and rain force their way in, and hasn't frost already appeared several times with a stern face? A few days ago, the sky was gloomy as if heavy snow was about to fall. Although people say it's warm here, snow may not fall, and the wind won't be as piercing as in the borderlands. But who can truly predict the weather now?

There's fog this morning. The fog will clear in a while. After it clears, it will let the warm sunshine through. So, say good morning to the violets.

Cat

At midnight, when I was awakened several times by cunning mice, I always thought of cats.

The next morning, when I found several places in my beloved book gnawed through and the ink bottle on the table knocked over, I thought of cats even more.

But I don't like cats.

I wrote to my sister far away, saying that the room I live in now needs to have a cat. But I have many things to do and have no time to take care of a cat, and I don't love cats either. I also told her that when I was a child, one winter night, I woke up and suddenly heard a cooing sound near my ear. I was so scared that I screamed and buried my head in the quilt, just yelling for my mother. It turned out that the neighbor's tabby cat was squatting by my head. I didn't know if it was close to me to keep warm or if it wanted to scratch me. Or... I scolded it: "You can't not let me know at all." Another day at noon, I was sitting on a low stool in the yard, concentrating on playing with picture cards. A few sparrows were hopping in front of me, pecking at food. I didn't pay attention to them or anything around me at all. Suddenly, a cat leaped out from behind me and caught one of them and ran away. I was so frightened that I dropped all the picture cards and ran into the house crying. I remembered that it had been sneaking up behind me a long time ago. Since then, I have been afraid of cats' footsteps being too quiet - although it never scratched me - a kind of fearful shock has been entrenched in my heart, running through my childhood. I don't understand why this childhood fear hasn't faded from my heart after so many years, just like a small mark I poked on my forehead in childhood, which is still on my forehead.

"Then let the mice drive you to move."

My sister replied jokingly in her letter.

I can't move. I don't like cats either, but I'm thinking of another way to subdue the cunning mice in the room.

### Scattered Notes on Returning Home

— Uncle Sun Ruying

The Grand Canal

This is the Grand Canal. It is not wide, nor does it have towering waves. It just flows slowly, quietly, and gently. Since I was very young, it has been like this; now, I have been separated from it for ten years, and it is still like this. When I left it, I was still a child, and when I see it again, I have already embarked on the path of adulthood. The Grand Canal is forever unchanging, but I cannot always remain young!

Now it is autumn, and the willows growing on the river embankment are about to wither. The withered yellow clusters of leaves are blown down by the west wind, floating on the lonely river. The weeds also look very withered and thin, desperately looking up at a high and vast sky. Under my feet is brown soil. Stepping on it, I know that this is my hometown. I search for the dreams I lost in my childhood on this brown soil, but I cannot even find the footprints of my childhood.

The people of the Grand Canal are forever immersed in the abyss of suffering. I can still feel the shock that the flood more than ten years ago gave me. Now, the people of the Grand Canal have struggled out of another man-made disaster. The water flowing in the Grand Canal must no longer be water, but the tears of the people, right?

I was born on the Grand Canal, and I am also a child of the Grand Canal. But I never shed tears in the river. I exchanged this more unfortunate and tragic fate for an unfortunate wandering life. Now, I have returned to the banks of the Grand Canal. Facing the Grand Canal, which is our mother, I really cannot suppress my sorrow!

Homeland

I stepped into my long-separated homeland, as if stepping into a strange place. A wall blocks the door I used to enter and exit in my childhood, and another door opened next to it replaces it. I groped along the winding path, walking towards the house where I was born.

I was born here, and I spent more than ten years of the happiest time of my life here. This ceiling, this window, should all remember the stories of my childhood. But everything here seems strange to me, and the house also seems to have become shorter and darker. When the vast dusk is still floating in the courtyard, an oil lamp must be lit indoors.

Everything has changed, the homeland, and myself. But the change in myself is greater than that of the homeland. Due to the change in the homeland and my own growth, a heavier layer of separation has been added between the homeland and myself. When I was wandering outside, thousands of mountains and rivers were the barrier between me and my homeland. When I returned home, my own irretrievable years blocked me from my homeland.

Slowly, I finally found the homeland in my memory, and I began to feel familiar with this long-separated homeland. I saw the apricot tree I climbed in my childhood, and I saw the target ring I drew on the wall in my childhood. I seemed to have returned to my childhood, as if I was playing with my brothers who still cannot return home. Only now do I understand the meaning of the golden childhood, but it is too late, and I can no longer linger a step in that golden age.

Open Space

Could this be the school where I studied for six years? There is no house here, no wall, not even a stone, not a tree. This is just an open space, an open space growing with withered grass!

I walked on this open space, and so many memories welled up in my heart. The old school building, the rows of winter green trees, the fat old Zhan who guarded the door, the aging face of the old teacher who once held me in his arms... All of this can no longer be seen, and even the opportunity to think of them affectionately is very rare.

I walked on this open space, mourning my childhood school, and tears welled up in my eyes. No passerby recognized me, and no one knew my state of mind. I really wish I could return to my childhood, carrying my schoolbag and holding my brother's hand to go to school, but that is impossible. My back is already bent, and the school has no shadow!

Open space, tell me, where are my teachers? Where are my classmates? Where have they all gone? Where have they gone? My close friends from my childhood no longer recognize each other when we meet now. This is really an inextricable sorrow!

The setting sun is hanging on the treetops in the distance, and the open space is painted with blood-like sunlight. Such a lonely open space, it probably also remembers the past prosperity, right?

### An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood 92

— Ye Jingfeng

According to my training, unless I am in a desperate situation, surrounded by enemies on all sides, then I have no choice but to risk my life and engage them in a battle that injures both sides. Otherwise, we must restrain our impulsiveness and proceed carefully step by step until we have exhausted our intelligence, done our best, and left no trace for the enemy to trace and search for, so that they remain completely puzzled. Didn't our general team leader also say, "We must not hesitate to sacrifice, but we must not make unnecessary sacrifices"?

If we were to rush onto the car, fire our guns, and then charge straight out, then I would have to ask some questions. We already know that to break out of this restricted area, we must pass over a bridge. Besides the automatic searchlight, the other defenses on the bridge must be tight and strict, right? What if this bridge is a movable bridge, and as soon as there is an alarm, it immediately moves away, or there are steel gates and electric nets at both ends of the bridge? Please, how can we two Don Quixote-like warriors cross the bridge? Isn't there also a checkpoint at the entrance? Is there really no defensive equipment at all?

To go even further, even if we have broken out, they have plenty of cars, armored vehicles, and trucks here. Can they really not chase us? If they chase us, it would be a tense scene that audiences would most welcome in a movie, but how can we two escape, and where can we escape to? To say that we could abandon the car after escaping for a while and hide in the sorghum fields, but we must not forget that there are also many fierce and agile detective dogs and giant mastiffs in this restricted area.

We have been observing all the way, and since discovering the gas station, I have never stopped planning a safe way to leave. I planned to place a safe igniter inside the gasoline boundary; this igniter must ignite and explode within a dozen minutes after we leave. Then we can retreat safely. So, after telling Tiger Brother about the ignition, I told him to listen to orders and not to be reckless.

I retreated outside the gasoline-soaked area to open my "treasure bag" and take out the incense coil box I was carrying. It was terrible! These incense coils were originally prepared specifically for this type of ignition work. Even the size of an incense coil, how much time it takes, and how much length it burns had been tested long ago, and now they were useful. Who knew that after searching and searching in the bag, I couldn't see the incense coil box. In anger, I dumped everything in the bag on the ground, and I couldn't see the shadow of the box anywhere. (Later, on the way back, I remembered that it must have slipped out when I was groping in the bag for something to eat before crossing the stream, and I didn't pay attention.)

Hurriedly putting the dumped things back in order, I rushed to Tiger Brother and told him to take out his incense coils. He kept turning the pump handle and reached into the bag, and just pulled it out. I took this treasure and retreated outside the gasoline boundary again, opened the box, and heavens! He had incense coils, but where were the incense coils? They had all turned into powder, not even an inch whole. It must have been the hot weather. Although Tiger Brother wasn't sweating, his body was damp. The dampness invaded the box, and with running, jumping, and tumbling, all the incense in the box had been shattered.

### Recession

— Shao Fu

According to a friend in the Social Affairs Bureau, based on the nature of the labor disputes over the past year, they can be classified into four stages, and the current stage is the most dangerous.

At the beginning of the victory, workers demanded resumption of work one after another because the factories were reinstated. This was the first stage of the labor dispute. The factories resumed production, and the economic situation was good; later, workers demanded that wages be paid according to the cost-of-living index. This was the second stage of the labor dispute. There was a way out for the products, and the manufacturers had profits, so the workers made this demand, proving that the economic situation was also good; then, workers demanded an increase in base salary. This was the third stage of the labor dispute, and the economic situation was certainly not bad; but later, the manufacturers gradually became unsustainable, requesting closure or requesting a reduction in scope and personnel. The workers demanded guarantees that they would not be dismissed without cause. This was the fourth stage of the labor dispute, and its nature was different from the previous three stages. It indicated an economic recession, which is a crisis.

The National Federation of Industrial Associations and the Federation of Chambers of Commerce have both held conferences in Nanjing, providing the authorities with very specific countermeasures to the current industrial and commercial crisis. As the end of the year approaches, the financial situation will become more tense. We very much hope to get through this year peacefully, and seeing the gradual recovery of transportation in various places, perhaps our wish will not be in vain.

### "The Dangerous Liar"

— Liǎo Rán (Understanding Clearly)

An "Excellent Article" in the English-language Da Mei Evening News

On October 31st, the English-language Da Mei Evening News published a letter from a reader entitled "Let's Organize the 'Get Out of China' Movement," the sender identifying himself as a "Former Friend of China." Its content went to the extreme in insulting China and the Chinese people. The letter began by mocking China's war against Japan, saying there were only defeats, no victories. Then it said that the supplies for rescuing China from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) were all embezzled. The Chinese people showed no gratitude for American aid. It also said that China had xenophobic laws and a corrupt judiciary. The Chinese only cared about their families, had no concept of the nation, no sympathy, no justice, no loyalty, and no dignity or mark to show that they were more advanced than beasts, and liked to mistreat animals… and so on. Therefore, he proposed to organize a "Get Out of China" movement, advocating that all foreigners withdraw from China, and that all transportation businesses, water and electricity companies, telephone companies, hospitals, buildings, asphalt roads, etc., run by foreigners in China, should all be removed from China. Furthermore, foreign countries should enact anti-Chinese laws so that Chinese people could not gain a foothold in foreign countries.

After this letter was published, the English-language Da Mei Evening News reprinted the original letter on November 2nd, and also wrote an editorial supporting the letter's arguments, saying that everything written in the letter was factual and deeply resonated with foreigners in China. As a result, foreign readers clamored to buy the newspaper that day in order to cut out the letter and send it back to their home countries. The newspaper had no choice but to reprint the original letter again, and hoped that readers would write in with their opinions, both for and against, etc. On November 4th, the newspaper published another letter from an American, signed "A Guest of China," scolding the one who called himself a "Former Friend of China" as a "Dangerous Liar," saying that everything said in his letter was untrue, did not represent the opinions of Americans, and donated 1,000 yuan for travel expenses, hoping that those who supported "Getting Out of China" would leave China as soon as possible. On November 5th, the newspaper published seven readers' letters on the issue on the entire third page. Three of the letters were written by foreigners and four were written by Chinese. They were all very long. The Chinese letters unanimously attacked the so-called "Get Out of China" movement and condemned the Da Mei Evening News for publishing the letter. Among the three letters from foreigners, one opposed "Getting Out of China" and two supported "Getting Out of China." Why did they support it? One did not explain the reason, and the other said that because he had returned to China and a petty thief had stolen a flute containing 12,000 U.S. dollars and other important documents, he felt that China was not what it used to be and foreigners should withdraw (this person wrote again on November 8th to correct himself, saying that what he opposed was only the chaotic state of China's post-war politics and economy, and that he did not agree with insulting the Chinese people, saying that Chinese people were the same as foreigners). On November 6th, the day the full text of the Sino-American commercial treaty was published, the newspaper still used the entire third page to publish letters about the issue. There were a total of eleven letters, three of which were written by foreigners, two of whom supported "Getting Out of China" and one of whom held opposing views. The remaining nine letters (from Chinese people) attacked the newspaper's editorial and the letter from the "Former Friend of China." On November 7th, the newspaper ended the incident with an editorial. The original position of the third page was used to publish the full text of the Sino-American commercial treaty. The editorial suddenly took a neutral stance, saying that every letter was written with sincerity, and some may have been written in blood. The conclusion was "Let the past be the past, and in the future, Chinese and foreigners should try to cooperate." However, this incident did not end. On November 8th, the newspaper had three more letters on the issue, two of which were written by Chinese people, attacking the newspaper for abusing friendship and insulting China, going beyond the normal bounds of freedom of speech. Although one letter written by a foreigner did not support "Getting Out of China," it considered Chinese people to be bad children who were "taught but not improved."

Chinese Readers' Reactions

The most touching thing was that on November 9th, the newspaper had three more letters from readers. The first letter was written by a Chinese person, who righteously and sternly blamed the newspaper for its inappropriate remarks and actions, saying that the Chinese government's tolerance of the incident was sufficient to prove that China was a democratic and free country, and that the people had tolerance.

Indian Sympathy

The second letter was written by "An Indian Friend," who pointed out that American goods were being dumped on the Chinese market in large quantities, and no country other than China could tolerate similar situations. Foreigners came to China not to do good deeds, but because they felt it was beneficial that they stayed in China. Americans also had an ugly side, and they could not arbitrarily criticize Chinese people.

Words from an American Woman

The third letter, judging from the signature and tone, was written by an American woman. She said that she had discussed this issue with many friends, and this letter was the result of the discussion. First, she apologized to the Chinese people on behalf of the American people, because one of her compatriots had insulted China and destroyed the code of conduct that civilized humans should follow. She believed that countries should not be criticized by the shortcomings of other countries. Didn't the United States also have bandits, crooked politicians, yellow publications, lynching parties, slick businessmen, unscrupulous lawyers, and quack doctors? Those who supported "Getting Out of China" had not objectively observed the facts or studied history. She and these people only had one opinion in common: that these foreigners should all get out of the country, but the so-called transportation facilities, etc., should remain in China, because the foreigners who created them had already recovered the profits and costs, and the remainder should belong to those who actually built them with blood, sweat, and labor. The Da Mei Evening News publishing this kind of letter was destroying the principle of "freedom of speech" and was of no benefit to the mutual understanding and mutual tolerance that the world urgently needed today.

A war of words ended here. The newspaper's all-day editorial revealed that the so-called "Former Friend of China" was a retired Air Force soldier. According to the newspaper, this war of words was beneficial to China. What was strange was that since the newspaper claimed that most foreigners supported "Getting Out of China," why were there so few letters from foreign readers, and one-third of the letters received were voting against it? However, no matter what the truth was, the Da Mei Evening News publishing that "excellent article" by the "Dangerous Liar" was abnormal. There must be no more such crazy and slanderous acts in the future! At the same time, after seeing the reactions of American readers to that "excellent article," we believe that most American friends are not satisfied with that excellent article!

### Relief Supplies

— Yī Wěi (One Reed)

Indeed, this is good news for the disaster-stricken people. Batches of relief supplies are being transported in. Flour, soybean cakes, dried sweet potatoes, package after package, bag after bag, piled up like mountains. It is unknown how much time has passed, carried by vehicles and loaded on ships, before they finally arrive after many twists and turns. The disaster-stricken people now have a savior.

The Relief Association informs the county government, and the county informs the district, conducts investigations, and creates registers. After much time, it is reported to the county, and the county forwards it to the association.

Meetings are held, reports are made, discussions are conducted, and decisions are made on how to distribute the supplies! Decisions are made! Decisions are made! How to send personnel, how to transport them to the district, and how to distribute them.

Relief supplies arrive in the district. So much for a certain village, so much for a certain bao, so many jin of flour per person, so many pieces of cake, so many jin of dried sweet potatoes, to be collected on a certain date.

In this way, the refugees receive the supplies, open them, and take a look. How wonderful! The flour, fearing that the refugees will become inflamed from eating it, is specially the flour that has been stored for a very long time. The hateful bacteria have taken advantage of the situation to breed in the flour bags and become moldy. What about the soybean cakes? Fearing that the refugees' teeth will not be able to bite them, they are broken into pieces, piece by piece. What about the dried sweet potatoes? Each piece is as hard as a slate, and there is a frost-like powder scattered all over the ground. It turns out that the worms have already eaten their fill inside.

These are the relief supplies for the disaster-stricken people! This is the good news for the disaster-stricken people!

### "Phoenix Seeks Male"

— Nánzǐ (Man)

Every year on November 9th, American women celebrate "Man-Chasing Day." On the squares of various universities, male students run around, and female students chase after them. The man who is caught should become friends with the woman who chased him. This day is the most joyous festival for single women. They can openly chase after the men they love. The dignity of women is completely abandoned, reversing the usual custom of men chasing women. Women are in the dominant position, chasing after the men they choose. During the event, men must run as hard as they can to avoid being caught by the women. Thus, the squares are filled with men and women, laughing and chasing each other. In the end, very few do not end up as couples.

The origin of this festival is as follows: Many years ago, there was a very ugly woman in the remote Dabashi area of the American West. Her name was Sadie. She was old but no man pursued her. So on her twentieth birthday, she said to her father: "Dad, I'm twenty years old today. Many women my age are already married. Why don't I have a boyfriend yet?" Her father said: "Maybe someone will propose to you. Just wait!" She waited for fifteen years, but poor Sadie still hadn't gotten married. Her father also became worried. In desperation, her father came up with a plan: On November 9th, her father called all the unmarried men in the village and said to them: "Boys, since none of you dare to marry my daughter, I have to take strict measures! I announce that today is 'Sadie Day'! When I fire the first shot, you must immediately start running—when I fire the second shot—Sadie—she's already let you go first—will start chasing you. Whoever she catches will be her husband! One, two, three, go!" So Sadie finally got her husband. Many other old maids heard about this and thought it was a very interesting idea, so they designated November 9th as "Sadie Day" and celebrated it once a year. Americans have always liked excitement and novelty, and this festival soon became popular throughout the United States.

Another reason for the widespread popularity of this festival is that the famous American cartoonist Al Capp introduced this local custom in his long-running cartoon "Lil Abner" with great fanfare. Because his cartoon had many readers, especially popular among young college students, this festival also became popular in universities. Every year when it is held, male and female students wear the same clothes as the male and female protagonists in the cartoon.

People in Shanghai have always liked to imitate Americans. I wonder if Chinese female college students also have the courage to hold this festival? (This article is written with reference to the English-language Da Mei Evening News of October 11th and American Life magazine.)

### Hong Lanyou, the Busy Man Preparing for the National Assembly

— Jǐnxiá (Brocade Clouds)

Amidst the calls for the National Assembly to convene, Mr. Hong Lanyou, the secretary-general of the Preparatory Committee, has become the busiest person among the important figures. Mr. Hong speaks with a Yangzhou accent. Those important figures and colleagues who meet and interact with Mr. Hong day and night mostly think he is from Jiangdu, but in fact, Mr. Hong is originally from Huixian County, Anhui, but has been registered in Jiangdu for a long time. Mr. Hong is only forty-four years old this year, but he has already become a popular figure in the political world. His political life can indeed be described as "smooth sailing." Because as recently as the "Who's Who in Contemporary China" published in June 1931, Mr. Hong's name was not yet included.

Before entering the political world, Mr. Hong practiced as a lawyer in Shanghai in 1925, but not under his current name. Mr. Hong graduated from the Law Department of Aurora University and once served as a professor at the Central Political School. He is the author of two books, "General Theory of Jurisprudence" and "Outline of Chinese Legal History."

When Mr. Zhang Daofan was the Secretary-General of the Capital Municipal Government, he appointed Mr. Hong as his secretary. Mr. Hong's entry into the political world was originally due to Mr. Zhang's recommendation, but Hong was a natural political talent and was successively trusted and appreciated by Mr. Chen Lifu and Mr. Ju Juesheng. From then on, he rose steadily and greatly realized his ambitions.

Mr. Hong's father has passed away. He lived in Yangzhou and was happy to do good deeds and give generously. He participated in all local public welfare projects. Mentioning "Grand Philanthropist Hong" was well-known far and wide. Mr. Hong also has the legacy of his predecessors. He is currently the Vice Minister of Political Affairs of the Ministry of Social Affairs.

### The Innocent Murderer 2

Mrs. Lusson paused slightly, then continued, "After Adam came back, everything was fine. His leg gradually recovered. It didn't even matter when he was dancing. He was obviously very happy. Unexpectedly, after returning home from the first dance that night, I went to bed first because I was tired. When I suddenly woke up, Adam was actually holding my neck with both hands, looking very ugly. At that time, I knew that something was wrong. I couldn't resist a man of such a sturdy build. I had no choice but to resign myself to fate and reluctantly smiled. At least he thought I smiled. He immediately let go of his hand and said to me: You're actually smiling! I coughed for a long time and replied: Did I smile? Why would I smile? He suddenly burst into tears. That's how things ended."

"But things didn't end that easily. Since that time, his whole person seemed to have collapsed. He often suffered from insomnia and often drank alcohol, which he had never done before. Once on the balcony, he suddenly showed a ferocious face and gripped my body tightly. I knew that his desire for sex was about to flare up again, so I smiled at him and said, "Calm down, my love! Don't do those things that you don't want your mother to know." After hearing this, he looked at me, seemed ashamed, and laughed heartily. So the two of us laughed for a while, and that's how we ended another terrible encounter. This is definitely not a joke. I hope you can help him."

Mi En sat in silence for a long time, then said, "I certainly want to help you, but I must warn you that you are taking a great risk by continuing to live with him."

Mrs. Lusson replied, "If I don't stay with him, he may be even more unhappy. Since he was able to drag his crippled leg all the way through the forest area back to me, I believe that I can never leave him just to risk a sore throat."

Mi En then asked, "Has he come to see me here?"

"Probably."

"Then, how about next Monday?"

The appointment for Lusson to come to Mi En's clinic was at 11:00 a.m., but he didn't arrive until fifteen minutes later. He didn't arrive until 11:30. Lusson was a large man with a slight limp in one leg. He was wearing a sports coat and flannel pants. Mi En went up to greet him. In his conversation, he always expressed thoughts of being tired of the world. Mi En did his best to persuade him to come for one-hour talks three times a week. Lusson said, "Very well, but I want to state in advance that I don't have the money to pay for your consultation fee." Mi En said, "Let's discuss it again." Lusson then walked away. Twenty minutes later, he ran back and said to Mi En, "Hey! Do you know what? I almost murdered my wife once. Maybe she's afraid I'll do it again and be sentenced to hanging."

"Then why don't you murder her?"

Lusson frowned and replied, "It's really strange, even I can't figure it out. It's like something is stopping me from doing that, so I gave up. This thing is really stupid, and I can't remember all the details. I thought you should know."

"Well, yes," Mi En replied, "I think this thing is very important."

Lusson said "Goodbye" and ran away.
