### The Northeast Headquarters Will Move to Shenyang; Soviet Troops in Changchun Are Already Withdrawing

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 18th] Our main forces have already entered and garrisoned Shenyang, and the situation there is gradually stabilizing. The Northeast Headquarters and the Pacification Commissioner's Office have dispatched personnel to survey locations, and the move will be completed within a week. Shenyang will become the military and political center of the Northeast in the next two months. [Central News Agency Changchun Dispatch, 19th] Various signs indicate that the Soviet troops here are preparing to withdraw or have already begun to withdraw. (1) The municipal government has received verbal notification from the Soviet side to prepare to take over buildings. (2) The Soviet side has notified all food stores to settle accounts and notified the municipal government to settle public funds. The funds issued are half in Red Army notes and half in rubles. (3) More than a thousand former Manchukuo soldiers previously detained here by the Soviet troops have now been transported north by train. (4) The Soviet troops' current bread orders with local bakeries are only for one or two days at a time, unlike the previous orders for several months. It is reported that the Soviet troops in the western district of Changchun have already withdrawn. [Central News Agency Chongqing Dispatch, 19th] A spokesperson for the Military Affairs Commission stated: Regarding the Soviet Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Trotsenko's claim that the Chinese Changchun Railway between Panjin and Lushun, and between Panjin and Changchun, suffered multiple instances of sabotage or the laying of landmines, and that the Chinese government should be responsible because the railway's order is maintained by the Chinese railway police, it is found that there are many illegal armed forces along the Changchun Railway line. Without sufficient armed force, it is impossible to maintain security along the line. Furthermore, the Soviet troops' withdrawal from Shenyang to Changchun was not notified to our side in advance, nor was there any prior consultation with our side regarding the procedures for taking over the defense along the line. One or two days after the Soviet troops' withdrawal, traffic between Shenyang and Changchun was already obstructed by illegal armed forces. We were unable to dispatch troops to guard the area. Therefore, regarding the sabotage of traffic on the Chinese Changchun Railway, our side cannot be held responsible for maintaining traffic before our troops arrive along the railway line.

[United Press Chongqing Dispatch, 19th] Semi-official sources here stated that the Chief of Staff of the Northeast Soviet Army Commander Malinovsky met with the National Government's military representative Dong Yanping in Changchun yesterday and protested the "frequent disruptions" of railway transportation between Changchun and Dalian, stating that, according to the Sino-Soviet Treaty, the Chinese side is responsible for protecting the railway line. Dong replied that there are irregular troops not under the government's command along the line that are carrying out secret sabotage, causing transportation to be disrupted. The Soviet Chief of Staff further explained that, with the exception of a few procuring food and supplies, the Soviet troops south of Changchun have now completely withdrawn. Dong requested that the Soviet side protect the National Government's administrative officials sent to the Northeast to take over. The Soviet Chief of Staff replied that the Soviet authorities will only be responsible for protecting the areas where Soviet troops are stationed, and that there is no reason to suggest that National Government officials are being threatened.

### Communist Troops Capture Siping Street; The Whereabouts of Liaobei Provincial Government Personnel Are Unknown

[Our Changchun Dispatch, 18th] Siping Street, the location of the Liaobei Provincial Government, was captured by Communist troops yesterday morning.

It is still unknown where Chairman Liu Handong and other personnel have withdrawn to. Our delegation has dispatched several groups of personnel to meet and welcome them. Telephone communication between Changchun and Shenyang was available for a time in the morning but not in the afternoon, reportedly due to the Communist troops removing the equipment from the Siping Telegraph Bureau. Furthermore, no trains from Changchun are heading south. [Central News Agency Changchun Dispatch, 19th] All transportation routes south of Changchun have been completely cut off since the 16th. The railway's dedicated telephone line has only been able to reach Gongzhuling since the 18th.

It was restored again this morning and is still available as of the time of this dispatch. The whereabouts of Liaobei Chairman Liu after withdrawing from Siping remain unknown. The Siping Telephone Bureau has resumed operations, but when this station attempts to make inquiries while speaking with the bureau, the bureau staff refuse to answer.

### Zhongxing Coal Mine Prepares to Resume Operations; Two Northeast Mines Occupied by Communist Troops Have Been Flooded

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] Zaozhuang Report: The government and Communist representatives to the three-person joint management committee of the Zhongxing Coal Mine have not yet been appointed. The Beiping Military Mediation Department will solicit opinions from both sides before making the appointments. It is heard that Wu Ke'er, the special commissioner of the Economic Ministry's Yu-Yu-Jin Special Envoy Office responsible for taking over the Zaozhuang Coal Mine, will only be able to assist with matters within the scope of technology in the future. The two Northeast mines of the Zhongxing Coal Mine occupied by Communist troops have been flooded. The South Mine is protected by the National Army and has not been damaged. The troops of both sides have not yet withdrawn from the mining area. It is rumored that the National Army is preparing to withdraw. The Zhongxing Company is currently preparing to resume operations based on the repair plans reported by Chief Engineer Collick. Furthermore, the coal reserves in Zaozhuang appear to be limited, but the coal quality is very good and most suitable for coking. During the Japanese occupation, the highest output reached 4,000 tons per day, most of which was transported back to Japan by the North China Development Company for use in general national defense heavy industries. Very little of it was used to fire boilers. Recent estimates indicate that if the mine can smoothly resume operations, it can produce an average of 2,000 tons per day.

### The People's Political Council Opens Today

[United Press Chongqing Dispatch, 19th] The Second Plenary Session of the People's Political Council will begin at dawn on the 20th. Chairman Chiang will attend and address the representatives.

### Declaration of the Plenary Session (Continued and Completed)

Fifth, we must implement the guiding principles of the Sixth National Congress, which emphasized the Principle of People's Livelihood. The Principle of People's Livelihood is the ultimate goal to be achieved by the Three Principles of the People. At the present stage, to promote the Principle of People's Livelihood, this meeting believes there are both short-term and long-term solutions. First, we must stabilize order and alleviate the people's suffering before we can implement large-scale economic construction. Right now, we must alleviate the suffering of the farmers, workers, public educators, and soldiers defending the country who are on or near the brink of starvation. Their lives must be improved through legal means. This requires first stabilizing prices and maintaining currency value. The government must do everything possible to achieve this. Of course, we must also restore production to increase domestic supplies, purchase and transport grain to prepare for disaster relief, practice strict frugality to reduce unnecessary consumption, and establish international economic cooperation to allow the large-scale import of foreign materials, especially production tools. But the most urgent task at present is to restore transportation. As it is now, transportation is disrupted everywhere, people cannot travel freely, goods cannot flow smoothly, and everything else is impossible. Therefore, disrupting transportation not only harms the people's livelihood but is tantamount to placing the people in mortal danger. This meeting must frankly point out that we hope the Executive Headquarters for Military Mediation will effectively stop all actions that hinder road repair work and disrupt transportation administration.

In terms of long-term solutions, equalizing land ownership and regulating capital are the fundamental principles that our party must implement. Relieving the rural areas and curbing the current trend of land annexation to support independent farmers are also urgent tasks. The implementation of the post-war five-year economic construction plan relies on international economic and technical assistance. The various economic construction programs set by the Sixth National Congress of our party are the most correct plans. It is regrettable that they have not been effectively implemented in the past nine months due to the war and demobilization. In the future, we must urge the relevant government departments to intensify their implementation of the above-mentioned measures so that the people can live and work in peace and contentment and improve their living standards.

Sixth, we must uphold our original intention in the War of Resistance to maintain national sovereignty and consolidate world peace. Our fundamental foreign policy is to ensure the integrity of our national territory, sovereignty, and administration, and to abide by international treaties to consolidate lasting world peace. Our rejection of Japan's threat to conclude an anti-communist agreement and the most important goal of the eight-year War of Resistance were also based on this. Now that the War of Resistance has ended, for the sake of post-war reconstruction, we not only need domestic stability but also international peace. We do not want any contradictions or estrangement to exist between countries, so that the defeated aggressors have no chance of a comeback. We sincerely uphold the UN Charter. Our representatives have painstakingly tried to promote cooperation between our major allies at international conferences, which is a concrete manifestation of our policy. To establish lasting peace in the Pacific and the world, we must eradicate the opportunity for the resurgence of Japanese imperialism. This requires full understanding and close cooperation between our country and our allies, especially with the Soviet Union, which shares a border with us. We are willing to increase mutual trust and friendship with the utmost sincerity. We firmly believe that the strict observance of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance by both sides is the primary condition for increasing mutual trust and friendship. At the same time, in order to complete economic construction, we welcome the cooperation of any allied capital and technology within the scope of not violating Chinese law or conflicting with international agreements to which China is a party. Because only an independent, unified, strong, and prosperous China can eradicate the resurgence of Japanese imperialism and maintain lasting peace in the Pacific and the world. We firmly believe that the Northeast issue can be resolved reasonably and legally based on this understanding. We will not lose our confidence or neglect our efforts because of temporary phenomena. Finally, we must awaken all our party comrades to cherish revolutionary history, establish confidence, and recognize our own responsibilities. At this time when political tutelage is about to end and the revolutionary cause is entering the period of national construction, our party comrades must know that our party is the largest revolutionary party in China. It has led the revolution to save the country in the past, and it will lead the revolution to build the country in the future. This is our historical mission that has remained unchanged for decades. We will never shirk our responsibilities. We must remember that the Republic of China was created by our founder and the martyrs of our party. The suppression of warlords and the completion of unification were completed under the leadership of our party. The shackles of unequal treaties for a hundred years were lifted under the leadership of our party. The eight-year War of Resistance brought glorious victory to the country and the nation, and it was also successfully led by our party. Since our party has been able to complete these four great missions in modern history, we are even more convinced that under the leadership of our leader, it will be able to lead the compatriots of the whole country to complete this even greater mission of peaceful national construction. In the past, during the period of political tutelage, there were various shortcomings in both politics and party affairs. Many of these were due to objective conditions, but we ourselves cannot shirk our responsibility. The purpose of our revolution, as our founder said, is "to bring the people out of misery and into prosperity." Now that the country is in such a difficult situation and the people are suffering so much, we are truly heartbroken. We revolutionaries must be brave enough to take responsibility and brave enough to improve. We must conduct profound and continuous self-examination. This meeting believes that in order to shoulder the arduous responsibilities ahead, we must concentrate our will, reflect on ourselves, and strengthen ourselves to reform our party's work. We must work hard and serve the people to carry out our original revolutionary intentions. We must work together with all compatriots and people from all parties with a spirit of sincerity and trust to promote the success of national construction. In the past, our party received the cooperation of compatriots throughout the country, which enabled us to continuously accomplish great historical missions. Now, we must build the glorious and victorious Republic of China into a modern country that is prosperous, strong, and happy. We must unite and hold high the banner of the Three Principles of the People to enter the bright path of peaceful national construction.

[United Press Tianjin Dispatch, 19th] General Wedemeyer hosted a press conference here today. Several divisions of the National Army will be transported to the Northeast by American ships to strengthen their forces. However, there is a severe shortage of pilots and airport personnel, so the National Army will not be transported to the Northeast by American aircraft. Regarding the situation in the Northeast, he has "very little news" and does not know if the Soviet troops have plans to withdraw from other cities and towns besides Shenyang. Regarding the possibility of the American military in China sending Japanese soldiers and civilians back to their country in the Northeast, he has inquired about it. If it is decided to do so, the repatriation work can begin on April 15. He has read the Sino-Soviet Treaty in detail and believes that China has not given up sovereignty over Dalian. The United States can use Dalian as a port for repatriating Japanese personnel. Wedemeyer is quite optimistic about the overall situation in China.

### Soviet Troops Delay Withdrawal; Iran Formally Files Complaint; This Action May Trigger Cabinet Crisis

Truman to Appeal to Stalin for Reconciliation

[Our News] London, 19th (Broadcast): Iran's long-awaited complaint was finally delivered to the United Nations organization last night by the Iranian representative to the United States, requesting the Security Council to convene a meeting next Monday to discuss it. The content accuses the Soviet Union of violating the tripartite troop withdrawal agreement and interfering in Iran's internal affairs.

[Our News] London, 19th (Broadcast): Washington diplomatic circles believe that Iran's complaint to the Security Council will lead to the collapse of the current Saed Cabinet in Iran. According to some sources, Moscow warned Iran internally that if Iran filed a complaint with the Security Council, the Soviet Union would regard it as an unfriendly act. The newly appointed Soviet ambassador to Iran is expected to arrive in Tehran today, which is quite noteworthy. In addition, British Ambassador Bullard, who has already resigned, left Tehran for home today. [Agence France-Presse, Washington, 18th] This question denies the London rumor that the US government limited Iran to 24 hours to decide whether to submit the Iranian issue to the Security Council. [Central News Agency, Washington, 18th (Special Dispatch)] UN Secretary-General Lai Yi flew to Washington today. US Secretary of State Byrnes issued a brief welcome speech upon Lai's arrival. Lai is scheduled to visit President Truman and Byrnes on the 20th and go to New York on the 21st.

[United Press, Washington, 19th] Today, diplomatic circles here believe that the crisis in Iran may prompt President Truman to make a direct appeal to Stalin, demanding the solidarity of the three powers. The State Department denies this news, but cannot be confirmed by the State Department before such an appeal is issued. In fact, this method is not without precedent. Previously, when US-Soviet relations encountered difficulties, President Truman and his predecessor Roosevelt repeatedly expressed their views directly to Stalin. Diplomatic figures believe that it is reasonable for the President to take this action before the Security Council convenes next week. [United Press, Washington, 18th] State Department authorities confirmed today that the Soviet Union has responded to Iran's request for the withdrawal of Soviet troops, but demanded that Iran cede oil rights. It is said that negotiations have not yet been conducted with the United Kingdom regarding the internationalization of Iranian oil sources, but it is pointed out that this may be the only solution.

[United Press, London, 19th] British newspapers today cited reports from Tehran claiming that Soviet authorities are urging Iranian Prime Minister Saed to appoint members of the leftist pro-Soviet Tudeh Party, who hold the two important vacancies of Minister of Interior and Minister of Foreign Affairs, to the cabinet. [United Press, Baghdad, 19th] The Iraqi Airlines managed by the government refused to carry passengers from Baghdad to Tehran today. This shows the extent of the Iraqi authorities' concern for the situation in Iran. The authorities only allowed the plane to fly to Khanaqin, 200 miles from Tehran.

### Ten Top Soviet Cabinet Members All "Isolationists," All Distrustful of Western Countries

[Reuters, London, 19th] A special correspondent for the Daily Chronicle said: The sudden change of Soviet leaders has made the world outside the "Iron Curtain" feel astonished. Today, the top ten leaders of the Soviet Union are all figures who are hostile to Western countries. Stalin has eliminated the "pro-Western faction" in his close cabinet and replaced them with the backbone of the "isolationist faction," of course with Stalin himself at the top, followed by People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov, third by Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet Kalinin, fourth by the little-known Malenkov, fifth by former People's Commissar for Internal Affairs Beria, followed by Mikoyan, Marshal Voroshilov, Zhdanov, Andreev, and Kaganovich. These are the ten top figures in the Soviet Union who do not trust Western countries and do not like Western countries. Except for Beria, all of them are members of the Communist Party Politburo. Molotov, 55, is now firmly in the second position in the Soviet Union. He does not believe in Western nations and does not like Western nations. He is a typical Stalinist figure. Although Kalinin is nominally above Stalin in position, he is actually only a figurehead. Malenkov is Stalin's closest confidant and it is expected that Stalin's will may designate him as his successor. Beria, 47, is the leader of the national police and has been faithfully protecting the safety of Soviet leaders for fifteen years. Stalin has now ordered him to be responsible for matters relating to atomic secrets. From the Western point of view, those who are more interested among the remaining five are Zhdanov and Andreev. The former is the organization minister of the Communist Party and a political disciple of Stalin. He and Andreev both advocate extreme communism and are extremely resentful of Western democratic ideas.

### Claims of Soviet Troop Withdrawals from Germany Unconfirmed by Britain and the US

### U.S. Congressman's Warning

Allied Nations May Become Enemies, Prepare for Sudden Attacks

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 18th] Speaking at a meeting of the House of Representatives today, Democratic Congressman Sykes said that "the United States must prepare for attacks from any direction," and said that "the United States should reorganize and train its troops based on the experience gained in World War II." He said that "most of the Soviet army has not been disarmed and is implementing compulsory military training. It is not difficult to imagine the actual strength of the Communist army. In addition, the industrial capacity used by the Soviet Union is also very strong. In short, it is difficult to predict when we will have to rise up to defend ourselves again, but history proves that allies in one war may become enemies in another war."

### Britain Rejects French Proposal on Spain Again, Submits to Security Council Instead

### Canadian Prime Minister Announces Details of Atomic Espionage Case, Soviet-Canadian Relations Unaffected

[Agence France-Presse, Ottawa, 18th] Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King made a statement on the atomic bomb espionage case in the House of Commons today, stating that he sincerely believed that the involvement of employees of the Soviet Embassy in Canada in this case was not requested by their government in advance, and that he expected that once the case was concluded, the relationship between the Soviet Union and Canada would be improved. The government must handle this case carefully to avoid causing international disputes. The reason why the case was delayed until February of this year before it was announced and investigated was for this reason. The Canadian government deliberately waited until after the conclusion of the United Nations General Assembly in London before announcing the news in order to avoid hindering the proceedings of the General Assembly. The purpose of this investigation is to discover and punish Canadian suspects. The Soviet Union had already admitted the existence of the espionage case even before Canada announced the details of the case. There is now an opinion that there is no need to use espionage to share the secrets of the atomic bomb with the Soviet Union. However, the occurrence of this case dates back to the beginning of 1943, when the achievements of atomic energy research had not yet reached the point where they could arouse the interest of the Soviet Union. Later, when I proved that the various activities of the Soviet Embassy in Canada were a serious obstacle to the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada, I had a conversation with President Truman and then secretly went to the United Kingdom to meet with Prime Minister Attlee.

[United Press, Ottawa, 18th] The Canadian Prime Minister announced in Parliament today that, according to Soviet codebreakers, the Soviet Union actually used Canada as a espionage base for the United States and the United Kingdom, and the Fifth Column was also located in Canada.

### Will Cosmic Rays Replace Atomic Energy?

[Reuters, Lahore, 19th] Dr. Keer, a cosmic ray research scientist and assistant physics teacher at Forman Christian College here, recently predicted that in the not-too-distant future, the era of cosmic rays will replace the current era of atomic energy. According to Dr. Keer's research, cosmic ray radiation is 100,000 times stronger than the achievements of modern factories, and the radiation of its unit molecule is also stronger than the nucleus split from uranium atoms. Only a small amount of uranium is needed to make an atomic bomb, so compared with cosmic rays, today's atomic bomb is nothing more than a firework. The main obstacle to using cosmic rays at present is the lack of invention of a method to install them. However, the time to use cosmic rays to radiate atomic energy is not far away. When entering the new era, the atomic energy era will gradually become obsolete.

### To Strive for Freedom and Independence: India Determined to Fight with All Its Might - Nehru's Speech in Singapore

[Report from News Agencies] London, 19th Broadcast: Nehru arrived in Singapore yesterday amidst cheers. Today, he attended a mass rally and delivered a startling speech. It is claimed that "India is not striving for independence for itself alone, but is determined to fight to the end for the freedom of Asia. The universe cannot have only half of its people free while the other half remain slaves. After India achieves its own freedom, it will devote all its strength to fighting for all dependent nations." In the evening, he attended a banquet hosted by the Overseas Chinese Association. During the banquet, overseas Chinese leader Tan Gengji stated, "The fate of India's 400 million people is closely tied to their leader."

[United Press, Singapore, 19th] Nehru's visit to the Malay Peninsula seems to have the effect of promoting morale among the Indian diaspora. The Singaporean Chinese community is also particularly concerned about Nehru's visit, believing that Nehru sympathizes with China and has the potential to become Prime Minister of an independent India. Yesterday, Nehru issued the following brief statement to reporters: "I have come here to be with the Indian people. Singapore is a large metropolis where various Asian races converge. Aside from the Malays, the Chinese comprise the largest part of the population. We Indians and the Chinese people have a growing friendship. Singapore will be a melting pot for Asian unity.

I hope this trip will contribute to the promotion of Asian unity."

### Goering, in His Testimony, Still Believes in Might

And Explains the Purpose of the Nazi Party

[Reuters, Nuremberg, 19th] Goering, under questioning by the chief American prosecutor at the International Military Tribunal yesterday, answered as follows:

(1) I have no doubt that Hitler and Goebbels committed suicide. (2) In the days before Germany's collapse, neither I nor Himmler conducted negotiations with the enemy. (3) Germany's attack on the Soviet Union in 1941 was a "dangerous action for Germany." Goering added: I did not want to wage war, but as the old saying goes, "The strong in arms have peace." I still hold this belief. The chief American prosecutor further questioned Goering, saying that he was the only person who could explain the true purpose of the Nazi Party and the intention of the "Fuhrer principle." Goering replied that the Nazi Party's purpose was to eliminate all opposition forces that could disrupt construction work. Regarding the "Fuhrer principle," it can be explained by the words of the late American President Roosevelt: "Most European countries have abandoned democracy. This is not because European countries do not need democracy, but because democracy cannot produce people who give work, bread, and peace." Moreover, democracy has in fact destroyed Germany, only the rule of strong leaders can restore its peace.

### Special Article: Shanghai's Current Financial Problems

— Yu Zengkang

Since the victory, Shanghai's financial situation has continued in its past state of instability. Especially after the end of January this year, the fluctuations have been even greater, turning into a state of chaos. Although the authorities have cracked down on speculation and closed down the black market, black market activities still exist. It was not until the foreign exchange market was opened and the gold policy was emphasized that the financial situation became slightly more stable. However, the seriousness has not been resolved, and speculators are still looking for opportunities to enter. Therefore, we still hope that there will be reasonable improvements so that it can achieve lasting stability. This is necessary during the rehabilitation period. Moreover, post-war economic construction depends on financial support, so the resolution of financial problems and the rationalization of financial trends should be implemented as soon as possible, without further delay.

Now that the country is unified and Shanghai has returned to its position as a financial center, the impact of changes is no longer limited to the local level, as it was during the period of occupation, but is now national in scope; the recent gold rush is an example of this. Therefore, the improvement of Shanghai's financial situation cannot be delayed. As for the improvement, we must concentrate all our efforts to overcome the deep-rooted problems and numerous obstacles. We must not give up eating because of choking, or accommodate the facts. Impractical actions and delays should no longer be used, as they will only create problems and increase difficulties. Existing weaknesses should not be allowed to exist in even the slightest degree, so as not to increase obstacles to post-war economic construction.

Shanghai's financial chaos is too deep and too far from the ideal, so improvement methods cannot be achieved in one fell swoop, but can only be implemented separately according to the urgency of the need, and actively promoted in order to achieve success. At the same time, improvement measures must be carried out in multiple ways, addressing both the symptoms and the root causes, and we must strive for time and move forward in order to prevent the recurrence of major financial fluctuations. The author would like to offer a few suggestions, based on my personal views, regarding the areas that urgently need improvement, for the reference of my fellow countrymen:

Unified Financial System: In the past, the financial industry, regardless of its management methods or operations, was quite complex, and the levels varied. Furthermore, the operations lacked direction and planning, and each followed its own natural development, resulting in a chaotic financial system and dispersed financial power. To improve Shanghai's finances, we must first unify the financial system from this chaotic situation and strengthen the banking system, so that it can have the power to regulate and control social finance. First, although the central bank has gradually stabilized its rightful position, it still feels that it lacks the ability to cope with the current financial upheavals and credit expansion, so we still hope for further reform and strengthening so that it can take on a definite leading role to control the entire Shanghai financial system. Second, although the current banking system has a division between state-owned and private, and the organization has a form of decentralization, the scope of operations has not yet been divided, inevitably overlapping. Not only can it not achieve the effect of division of labor and cooperation, but it also hinders the development of its own special operations, so that the industrial financial system cannot be established. The incompleteness of the financial system, coupled with the current unfavorable phenomenon of depleted industrial capital and inflated commercial capital, cannot be adjusted and improved. Therefore, in the future, national banks should quickly abandon the operation of ordinary banking businesses, and each should work hard in its own position, without competing with each other, and cooperate fully to consolidate financial power.

(II) Improve Banking Operations: The improper banking operations are also a contributing factor to Shanghai's financial chaos, so we cannot allow them to continue to be delayed, and we must strive for improvement. However, the reason why banking operations have not been able to develop properly also has its contributing factors, such as weak capital, narrow business scope, excessive interest burden, and lack of investment channels, especially during the occupation period, and even to this day, there has been no improvement, and they are still wandering on the wrong path. This phenomenon not only hinders financial stability, but is also harmful and useless to the banking industry itself. Therefore, in the future, we should actively reform so that it can meet the needs of post-war construction, so that it can stand in the environment of the new era. First, banks must establish a sound business policy and formulate a comprehensive plan so that business expansion has something to follow. Second, improve the internal organization and increase service efficiency to eliminate the adverse effects of the public on the banking industry during the occupation period. Third, expand the scope of activities to improve the current situation of dust gathering in Shanghai and the lack of outlets for financial funds. Fourth, work hard on the development of the credit system to increase deposits and expand business. Fifth, we should guide the reduction of social interest rates to reduce costs. Sixth, at this time, it is necessary to re-examine the loan policy of banks. In order to help the recovery of industry and the expansion of its own business, banks should adopt a mixed-operation system. In addition to adjusting short-term commercial credit, they should actively participate in industrial lending, but the nature of industrial lending is different and should be limited to available fixed capital. Seventh, the banking industry should stop speculative operations and assisting speculators. Eighth, banks should reduce investment in real estate and should open up other investment avenues and invest in legitimate businesses. Although the above items require self-improvement of the banking industry, self-improvement is not enough, and active supervision and promotion by the authorities are also needed.

(III) Establish Capital Market: The lack of a capital market in Shanghai has always been deplored by knowledgeable people, resulting in the inability to link finance and industry, and the lack of a home for private floating capital, with far-reaching harmful effects. Before the war, there was also a securities market for buying and selling public bonds and foreign stocks. During the occupation period, there was also the rise of the Chinese stock market, but this market was completely dominated by speculation and lost the original intention of establishing a securities market. Now, after the victory, the market has been closed, resulting in a black market. Black market activities lack a formal channel, and it is easier for large households to manipulate, resulting in unprecedented large fluctuations. Although the authorities have cracked down, it is of no help in practice. It is better to resume operations as soon as possible, rationalize securities trading, and guide floating capital to industry, which can also partially solve the serious problem of floating capital. However, the resumption of the securities market must be very cautious, and we must not repeat the mistakes of the past and create a place for speculation. It should be thoroughly improved so that it can become a formal capital market. First, the Chinese stocks, public bonds, and foreign stocks markets should be merged and opened to facilitate management. Second, the listed stocks should be strictly reviewed to avoid the influx of bad credit and the malignant expansion of chips, in order to protect the safety of investors and cultivate the habit of investing. Third, strictly stipulate the range of ups and downs to enhance the power to stabilize stock prices. Fourth, improve the stock issuance method and establish an intermediary institution for guarantee underwriters to strengthen the organization of the stock market. Fifth, Issue Bonds to facilitate the abundance of industrial funds. Sixth, Government Bonds rise, increase the number of bonds, prevent manipulation by speculators, and absorb a part of the floating capital.

(IV) Restore the Exchange: In addition to the securities market, Shanghai also has the financial market for bidding, foreign exchange and foreign currency, as well as the commodity market for food, cloth, etc. Since the victory, they have also been suspended one after another, resulting in all transactions falling into the black market and failing to be incorporated into the right track. The huge fluctuations are even more severe than the securities black market. Therefore, the exchange policy cannot be decided without delay, especially now that the foreign exchange market has been opened, in order to stabilize exchange rates, it is even more necessary to stabilize finance and prices. First, at a time when the problem of tourism cannot be completely resolved and speculation cannot be eradicated, and the financial authorities have already emphasized the use of gold policies, the gold market should be restored as soon as possible so that tourism funds can flow back into gold, and the government can reasonably control it. This is also a way to temporarily stabilize tourism funds, and it is easier to achieve results than manipulating the black market. Second, the commodity market should also be restored as soon as possible so that commodity trading can be rationalized, and the market price fluctuation has a certain range, so that normal industry and commerce can engage in regular transactions. Then tourism funds in industry and commerce can also have a home.

Financial stability, although dependent on the end of inflation, but the contraction of currency and the slowing of currency circulation rate must also have a sound financial system to facilitate the promotion. Although the above four items are mostly old-fashioned, they are indeed what urgently need to be resolved at present. If they can be earnestly achieved, then the current financial problems can be easily solved and rescued from chaos. Moreover, the financial situation itself can have some changes and tend to be sound. The unification of the financial system and the improvement of banking operations are the basic problems of financial institutions, which can enhance the control power over the entire financial system. The establishment of a capital market and the restoration of the exchange are not only the necessary ways for financial prosperity, but also the problem of tourism can be temporarily solved, and it can also be used as a base for the central bank's open market policy. The above four points are still our minimum requirements for Shanghai's financial improvement. The further reforms in the future can be started from here. In short, Shanghai's financial situation in the future must appear in a new posture in the post-war economy in order to ultimately accomplish the arduous responsibilities and missions that it should shoulder.

### Local Communications

Suzhou

Request to Sell Received Supplies at Affordable Prices

The county magistrate of this county believes that Suzhou was a place where enemy materials were concentrated during its occupation. There is a considerable amount of stored materials, and after the victory, various parties came to Suzhou to take them over, sealing them into warehouses. Stored for a long time, they are prone to mildew. To this day, they have not been processed. At a time when prices are soaring, they should be opened up for sale at affordable prices to help people's livelihood. Therefore, a special request is made to the provincial government to forward this to the Suzhou, Zhejiang, and Anhui Enemy and Puppet Industry Management Office to quickly open up and sell them at affordable prices.

Changshu

Actively Repairing the Changcheng Highway: The highway from Changshu to Jiangyin is currently being actively repaired and may be open to the military in mid-April.

Puppet Township Chiefs Shortchange Military Rice

The County Finance Rectification Committee found that the puppet township chiefs and heads of neighborhoods in the county during the enemy's occupation collected military rice and military wheat. The amount of rice and wheat shortchanged was considerable. Although the districts were ordered to thoroughly investigate, no reports have been received. A further meeting has been held to order the districts to investigate and recover the rice and wheat to increase public revenue.

Zhenjiang: Improving the Lives of Public School Teachers and Staff

The Jiangsu provincial authorities, in order to understand the difficult lives of public school teachers and staff, have decided to first temporarily transfer funds from other political expenses before the central government allocates funds for adjusting the treatment of public school teachers and staff in provincial-level agencies for February and March (salaries will be increased by 11,000 times, and the basic living allowance will be 35,000 yuan). With the approval of the central government through the Food and Grain Office, 20,000 piculs of rice will be allocated under the military grain purchase project. From March to July, public school teachers and staff will be able to purchase five pecks of rice for 3,000 yuan, and regiment police will be able to purchase two pecks of rice for 1,200 yuan.

Jiangyin

Prolonged Rain Causes Disaster and River Works to Stop

The Dongheng River has not been dredged for many years, which is related to the farmland water conservancy of the Eastern Township. After the Relief Association and the County Government planned and submitted a request to the Relief Association Su Ning branch, the dam was cut off and the water was drained. The lower level was excavated. Unexpectedly, since the beginning of spring, there has been a disaster of prolonged rain, which has lasted for more than 20 days and has not yet cleared. Low-lying fields have become swamps, and mountain floods have broken out, causing a sea of water in the Heng River, making it impossible to excavate. The wheat seedlings have also withered and turned yellow, affecting the small harvest, which is worrying.

Nantong: The Division Forbids Soldiers to Watch Plays: Since the arrival of the 105th Division of the National Army in Tongjing, the division commander, Liu, has recently issued an order prohibiting soldiers from watching plays. Officers are allowed to purchase tickets to watch plays during the day, but regardless of officers or soldiers, they are prohibited from entering the theaters at night. Teams are dispatched to maintain order in the theater, and military discipline is extremely good. Captain Luo Yan, a staff officer of the Political Department of the division, has been stationed at the Military-Civilian Cooperation Station in the city to assist the station in handling military-civilian cooperation work.

Recently, the people of the neighborhoods crowded to the chiefs' houses to demand settlement. The houses of the two chiefs were completely demolished, and Sun and Qian were eventually captured. Upon hearing the news, the authorities sent Secretary Li and Luo, the captain of the Self-Defense Brigade, and Xu, the director of the Police Bureau, to appease them. However, before the matter was settled, the ninth neighborhood of Fuli Township, which is adjacent to the township, had another incident. The townspeople went to the chief's home to demand the return of the excessive military and public grain. The chief opened fire to threaten them, which aroused public anger and almost led to a murder case.

Guangming

Seven Batches of War Criminals

In order to report on the organization and interrogation procedures of this military tribunal, the department held a tea party yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM to receive reporters. Yang Gangzhang, Staff Officer of the Command Post, and Zhang Yulin, Director of the Press Office, presided over the event.

### Accused of Colluding with the Enemy: Yin Dingyi on Trial

[Our Newspaper] Tilanqiao High Court Criminal Division, presided over by Judge Cai Jun at 3:00 PM yesterday, investigated Yin Dingyi, 57 years old, from Sichuan. On December 18, 1939, his son Yin Maoling was arrested and executed by secret agents at 76 Jessfield Road, leading to his own imprisonment for three months. After his release, the Wang puppet regime, recognizing his past position in the military, appointed him as a lieutenant general staff officer. Therefore, he is being prosecuted under Article 2, Section 1 of the Punishment of Traitors Act. However, according to Yin, he did not go to Nanjing to accept the official position. Both he and his son were intelligence officers under Li Mingyang, the current Deputy Commander of the Eleventh War Zone and Commander-in-Chief of the Yangtze River Downstream Advance Army, during the enemy occupation. He claims he was not a traitor and served underground, listing various "evidence." He also stated that his hired lawyer is helping him on a pro bono basis. The judge, considering the evidence in the case insufficient, adjourned the hearing to continue the interrogation of Yin Dingyi regarding the charge of colluding with the enemy.

Japanese Forced to Sign Confession

### US Military Continues Trial of Japanese War Criminals; Nelson Still Testifies

Japanese Forced to Sign Confession

Sentencing of American Pilots to Death

The US military tribunal established by the US War Crimes Trial Commission continued the trial yesterday of former Japanese 13th Army Commander Lieutenant General Sawada Shigeru, and Wakou Yuuki, Taterakawa Tsugiro, Okahata Hidehira and others, for the murder of American airmen of the Doolittle Raid that bombed Tokyo. Captain Nelson, an American pilot who participated in the bombing, continued to testify in court. According to his testimony, after being captured by the Japanese, they were subjected to trial and forced to sign confessions admitting to bombing hospitals, school districts, charitable organizations, and churches in Tokyo. At the time, they were unaware of the content and were simply forced to sign Japanese documents. The Japanese then used these documents as evidence to convict the pilots. They had no opportunity to defend themselves. The court set up by the Japanese military initially sentenced them to death, but the sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment by order of the Japanese Emperor. Defense lawyers Lieutenant Colonel Bottini and Captain Flowers sought to clarify two points: (1) the pilots had bombed non-military areas, and (2) they signed the confessions admitting to bombing military areas. Therefore, they were not forced to sign. Bottini later asked Nelson if he harbored great resentment, hoping to prove that Nelson might have bombed non-military targets in Tokyo. But Nelson's answer was excellent: "My feelings toward the Japanese are no different from my feelings toward garbage." The battle of arguments concluded at 4:30 PM. Lieutenant Colonel Kurtz then testified, proving the authenticity of the evidence he collected. The defendants remained quiet and expressionless in court. The court is scheduled to resume the trial at 9:00 AM today.

### Continuous Rain is Annoying, but Reduced Mildew Season is Welcome; Northeasterly Winds Arise; The Weather Will Clear Up

[Our Newspaper] The weather has not been good since the 23rd of last month. Even when it doesn't rain, there is no sun. The continuous spring rain is maddening. Farmers are worried that excessive rain will damage their crops and urgently need sunshine. Anyone who has to go outside every day hates the rain the most. So, when will the weather clear up? This question needs to be asked of the heavens. The reporter is no exception and had to visit the Shanghai Meteorological Observatory of the Central Meteorological Bureau. Coincidentally, Director Zheng Zizheng was also troubled by the prolonged rain. He said: "Six inches and seven tenths of rain have accumulated in the past three weeks. Although the sun appeared briefly on the 12th of this month, it was quickly covered by dark clouds. It snowed again on the 15th, and there were thunderstorms on the 17th and 18th." Director Zheng also said: "The winter was not cold because warm air enveloped the Yangtze River area. Since the beginning of spring, cold air from North China has flowed south, and the cold and warm air masses meet in the Yangtze River basin, causing continuous rain. However, the northeasterly wind has recently risen, and the weather is improving, and will likely clear up, but the temperature will inevitably drop. It is also predicted that the mildew season this year may be reduced as a result."

### Resentment Over Failure to Borrow; Gathering Accomplices to Kidnap and Murder

The Murderers in Zhuzhai Town Have Been Arrested

[Our Newspaper] Huang Youkang (style name Chengbo), 41 years old, a local resident, worked in the Jinpu Railway Bureau before the war. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, Huang resigned from his job and returned to his hometown, Zhuzhai Town, to do business because he was unwilling to participate in the puppet organization. On the 14th day of the third month of the lunar calendar in 1945, bandits Wu Bosheng and Shi Jingen led nine accomplices to Wangwo, forced him to leave, and shot him at the Panzhong Bridge, about one mile east of the town. He was shot twice in the face and stabbed twice in the throat, a tragic death. The reason was that Wang Shan was engaged in business and had accumulated wealth, which was coveted by the bandits, who had repeatedly failed to borrow money from him, leading to resentment. After the incident, the murderers fled without a trace. At that time, the family members were unable to seek justice due to the enemy puppet regime. However, the bandits continued to operate in the Qinghu Road area, robbing traveling merchants, committing numerous crimes. On the 15th of this month, Chen Hongjun, the leader of the Third Squad of the Wujiagang Defense Group in the West Shanghai District, led his team members to arrest them in the nearby villages, took them for interrogation, and transferred them to the Zhuzhai Town Police Sub-Station, which transferred them to the Xinjing Precinct for detention. It is reported that Wu Bosheng and others confessed to the shooting of Huang Youkang. Huang's wife, Zhang Huiying, went to the precinct to identify them without error and confronted them with all the facts. Now, Huang Zhang Huiying and her son Guozheng have jointly submitted a petition to Director Xuan of the Municipal Police Bureau, requesting that they be severely punished according to the law to uphold human life.

### Japanese Emperor Should Be Listed as a War Criminal: Views Expressed by Mr. Kaji Wataru, Leader of the Japanese Anti-War League

— Our Correspondent, Canglong

"The Japanese Emperor should be listed as one of the war criminals. He bears the greatest responsibility for this war disaster. Because the Emperor had absolute power to control this war disaster, but he did not try to stop it... The misfortunes and hunger of Japan during the war were all brought about by the Emperor system, so the Emperor system should definitely be abolished, but the handling should be cautious..."

Yesterday at six o'clock in the afternoon, a group of reporters crowded into a small room on the fourth floor of the Great China Hotel, surrounding Mr. Kaji Wataru (see picture), leader of the Japanese Anti-War League who had just flown in from Chongqing. Questions were fired at him like a string of pearls. When the focus of the conversation shifted to the Emperor system, he expressed the above view without hesitation. His calm demeanor and the incisive edge of his arguments demonstrated the strength of his anti-war will. He said that after this war disaster, the Japanese people have deeply felt the need for democracy. It is estimated that 60% to 70% of the Japanese people support democracy. As long as they can unite, they should be able to achieve a democratic and peaceful Japan. Therefore, he firmly believes that the Japanese nation will be able to transform Japan, burying the past in the ruins and debris. However, Kaji Wataru wants to cultivate new buds of Japanese democracy on this foundation. He is hurrying back to do some cultivation work. Regarding the general election scheduled for April 10 of this year, Mr. Kaji believes that the time is a bit too pressing. He fears that the Japanese people are not prepared enough for the election and hopes that the time can be extended. He also hopes that under the premise of democracy, all Japanese political parties should jointly cooperate. They should prepare more for the election, but they should not engage in unwarranted attacks! When talking about the future relationship between China and Japan, Mr. Kaji said: Both China and Japan are great nations. Together with India, Indonesia, and other nations, their population accounts for half of the world's population. Therefore, without peace between the two major nations of China and Japan in East Asia, the liberation of East Asia is impossible. In the past, a small number of Japanese aggressive elements and privileged classes disrupted the national relationship between China and Japan. Now, we should try to reconnect them again, so that in the future, in terms of culture, education, and technology, we can have satisfactory relationships and foundations to realize the relationship between the national governments of China and Japan! The reporter could not help but ask him about his impression of China. His bright and spirited eyes flickered, revealing a smile, and he said: "China is the benefactor of my life. I feel extremely honored to be able to participate in this liberation war of East Asia. China has 450 million people and is a great nation. China's future is full of hope and will surely create a new era for East Asia. China's happiness will be enough to influence the happiness of East Asia and also enough to influence the happiness of Japan!" For eight years, Kaji Wataru has stood on the same front as China's resistance against Japan, launching anti-war propaganda against Japan. From 1938 to 1939, when the Anti-War League had not yet been established, he went to Japanese prisoner-of-war camps in Hunan and Chongqing to conduct propaganda. He collected his work from this stage and completed a reportage, "A Record of Peace Village." On December 25, 1939, the Anti-War League was established, and he served as its leader. He then took seven Japanese comrades to work in the South China area. At that time, the Japanese army was attacking Nanning. They went in and out of the front lines with the Chinese army, actively launching anti-war propaganda against Japan. The work experience is collected in a collection called "My Seven People." In 1944, he also worked with the Chinese army in Changde, Hunan, and Yichang, Hubei, to conduct propaganda against the Japanese army. He sent daily reports to Chongqing, which were collected into a book called "Frontline Correspondence." The above are just some of his major services to China during the war. However, before coming to China, he was arrested and imprisoned as many as 26 times in Japan from 1928 to 1935 because he often participated in gatherings of socialist believers! Finally, the reporter congratulated him on his appointment as General MacArthur's political advisor. He said: He received this news from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs last September, but he has not yet received a formal instruction from General MacArthur. Flying to Shanghai with him this time were his wife, Chii Sachiko, two children, and four staff members. Unfortunately, yesterday morning, his four-year-old child was looking out of the window of his fourth-floor room when he accidentally fell to the street, injuring his head. He was sent to Renji Hospital at 11 o'clock, but he was already unconscious and lost his child! However, when Kaji Wataru met with reporters, there was no trace of sadness on his face. He is burning with a torch to create a new democratic Japan. The brilliance and enthusiasm of this fire are enough to cover up all the old and new wounds he has suffered in the past eight years!

### Decreased Black Market Demand, Gold Prices Gradually Decline, Both Old and New Hong Kong Dollars Rebound

Yesterday, the gold market initially stabilized but then weakened. The Bank of China still allocated 595 bars at the original price of 1.62 million, so the supply was relatively smooth, but it was not easy to sell. After a detailed explanation of the US gold price issue by this newspaper, people's minds gradually stabilized. In the afternoon, it weakened further. The market opened with a slight drop at around 1.65 million, but this price could not be sustained for long and gradually declined slightly. The market price was slightly higher than the Bank of China's allocation price, and all 595 registered bars were approved. Some chips felt a bit abundant, and there was less activity from buyers in the black market. As a result, it appeared weak, and hot money turned to cold medicine. At noon, it had broken through the 1.6 million mark. In the afternoon, it reached 1.58 million, and the excess was cleared. In the end, it remained below 1.6 million. As a result, it closed about 65,000 lower than the previous close. Gold jewelry in silver shops was listed at 173,000 yuan, and silver at 1,600 yuan. Silver dollars were stable, and the hidden discount rate was 1.8 to 3.2 cents. The Bank of China's controlled prices were reasonable, and speculators were unwilling to step forward in today's market. The number of those who gave up increased daily, and the range of fluctuations will become narrower.

Foreign currency US dollars were extremely sluggish, and the gold market declined. In the afternoon, it also became tired. It opened at 2030 yuan and struggled for a long time around 2010 yuan. At noon, it had fallen back into the 2000 yuan range. As a result, it fell back 40 yuan. Old Hong Kong dollars were still in demand due to Hong Kong telegrams. As a result, it rebounded another 5 yuan. New dollars were initially flat, hovering around the previous close. In the afternoon, it rose slightly. As a result, 36-year dollars rose by 3 yuan, and 37-year dollars rose by 2 yuan. The US exchange rate remained unchanged. Hong Kong telegrams were 46 yuan, and rupees were 560 yuan, and there were still settlements.

Government bonds were lackluster yesterday, with little change. Mature type C bonds fluctuated by only a little over 100 yuan, going from strong to weak in the middle. As a result, each bond fell slightly by 30 yuan to 50 yuan. Chinese stocks stopped falling and rose. There was no way out for speculative funds. The Savings Bank Law promulgated by the authorities stipulates that marketable securities of production enterprises should account for 40% of the reserve, and the market situation gradually improved. However, the industry was preparing to deliver foreign shares purchased the day before yesterday (foreign shares are settled the day after purchase), and a large amount of liquidation was absorbed by speculative funds outside the industry. As a result, it gradually improved from low to high. However, the process was much less inferior to Mei Ya. As a result, the afternoon close was 50 yuan better than Yongsha and 100 yuan better than Mei Ya. Jingfu and other small hot stocks were each 5 yuan to 7 yuan better. In the afternoon, those who delivered the day after tomorrow raised their prices. Yongsha was 3900 yuan, Mei Ya was 3050 yuan, and Jingfu was 235 yuan or more. The initial opening of the hot foreign stock market was stable, with Yisha above 8100 yuan, but it was soon suppressed by the inventory sold by the bulls. Large stocks fell back half a percent after rising high. Small stocks of steel and paper rose a lot due to the high bids the night before, and although there were dips after the rise, they were still 10% better than before.

### Sino-British Exchange Rate

Reuters, London, March 19: The Bank of England confirms that there is no official market price for exchange with China. Off-market transactions are being conducted at 5,550 yuan per pound.

### Rice Prices Continue to Rise, Food Problem is Serious

The rice market was cloudy and goods were scarce, and shops were still eager. Japonica and indica rice continued to increase by 2,000 yuan. White yuan and hidden yuan rose by another 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Flour exports were stagnant, but local demand was slightly improved, and prices were firm. The oil market was quite active in sales, and continued to rise by more than 2,000 yuan. Soybean cake retail sales were very active and rose by another 300 to 400 yuan. Bran's inland sales were lively, and the market was stable. Soybeans trended mediocre.

Furthermore, according to news from the local rice market, a total of 7,101 dan of edible rice arrived yesterday. The types are as follows: 3,030 dan of white japonica, 75 dan of mutton indica, 60 dan of Baiyuan, 1,891 dan of thin rice, 453 dan of Du indica, 18 dan of Xian Yuan, and 1,574 dan of early rice. More than 1,000 pieces of Taiwanese tea arrived.

### UNRRA Ships Wheat to Tianjin

Taiwanese tea arrives with more than 1000 cases

The Taikoo Company's Shandong vessel will sail to Tianjin this afternoon, carrying more than 16,000 bags of UNRRA wheat and 7,000 cases of tea, which are commercial goods. Tea was shipped from Taiwan, and the Haisu vessel arrived in Shanghai from Taiwan yesterday, carrying 1,900 cases. The Jiangjian vessel arrived in Shanghai from Oujiang and Ningbo yesterday morning. In addition to a large batch of wooden boards loaded from Wenzhou, the vessel also had more than 600 bags of native sugar.

### Yarn Prices Decline, Spot Cotton Trading Still Active

Yesterday, the yarn market took a sharp turn for the worse. In the early morning, amidst a wave of selling, prices gradually fell. Shuangma once approached one million, and 16-count Guangming also fell to near 800,000, a drop of 70,000 to 80,000 yuan compared to the previous day. People's minds were still tired, because the finished products of cloth mills and weaving mills were also feeling sluggish. The Textile Construction Company opened the sale of nine kinds of patterned cotton cloth and eleven kinds of American cloth yesterday. It will open the sale of woolen products today.

Yesterday, New York American cotton reported a rise of 12 to 15 points, with the recent US dollar at 26.75, the forward at 26.54, and the spot Middling at 27.34. The local spot cotton market was flat and tired, but the transaction was very smooth. The Textile Construction Company, which took over the Japanese yarn factory, needs cotton urgently, and is procuring 2,600 to 2,700 bales of fine velvet raw materials such as US Middling Changde flower and Brazilian flower. The Shenxin Yarn Factory continued to purchase 700 to 800 bales of Zhenhai Tijian.

### UNRRA Allocates Cotton, China Receives 510,000 Bales

[Reuters, New York, March 19] According to the Wall Street Journal, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) has purchased approximately 846,000 bales of cotton to aid countries that have suffered war losses, of which 35,000 bales are supplied by India. According to UNRRA's allocation plan, China will receive the largest amount, a total of 510,000 bales.

### White Lead Wire Sees a Slight Turnaround

Since new white lead wire arrived in port in mid-March, the market has gradually declined. For more than three weeks, there was no improvement. Until recently, there was a slight turnaround, and hard wire was even more popular due to its smaller quantity. Recently, the market price for sizes 8 and 10 is 80,000 yuan per dan, sizes 12 and 14 are 90,000 yuan, and size 16 is 120,000 yuan. As for fine patterns such as size 20, 200,000 yuan per dan is required. Hard wire is about 20% to 30% higher than the above prices.

### Asphalt Sales Market is Dull

Due to the rainy weather, the candle sales market has been greatly reduced, which has a significant impact on the asphalt market. Although small soap factories have slightly increased their purchases, they are all taking second- and third-class goods. High-quality goods such as Heben and Neiping oil are all sluggish. Fortunately, the source of high-quality oil is not much, so although the surface seems to lack energy, the content is still solid. And in terms of various oils, asphalt is uniquely cheap. Once the spring sales are launched, the future is very hopeful. However, railway freight rates have recently increased threefold, and costs have increased a lot, so sales prices have to be increased accordingly. The wholesale prices of merchants are listed below: Heben 58,000 yuan, Neiping 50,000 yuan, Lanjiao 46,000 yuan, and ordinary Lan oil 42,000 to 43,000 yuan.

### Market Price of White Coal Slag and Anthracite Coal Continues to Decline

The coal market is stable only for white coal lumps and small pieces of coal. White coal slag and anthracite coal continue the previous trend, and the industry continues to be bearish. Therefore, the market was shrouded in a selling atmosphere from the start, and prices continued to fall step by step, collapsing. Due to the rain, firewood and charcoal are still scarce, and the market situation is firm. It is expected that if the weather is sunny and smooth in the future, the arrival of goods will be strong, and the market price will inevitably fall sharply.

### Caustic Soda Collapses, Industrial Raw Materials Pour In

This city's industrial raw materials have been exhausted for a long time. Recently, a batch of caustic soda and bleaching spirit have been imported from Brunner Mond. Then, American merchants shipped various industrial raw materials from Manila to Shanghai. Although the number is not very large, general raw material merchants and hoarders are showing a weak and soft heart. Therefore, the goods that have arrived but have not been unloaded and the so-called short-term throwaway goods that are still on the way are rushing to sell them first, resulting in a consistent collapse in prices. Recently, the market price of American caustic soda has even been made at 250,000 yuan per barrel, which is only a quarter of the previous week's market price. Other hoarded goods such as bleaching powder, zinc gas powder, and fertilizer powder have also fallen sharply. It is heard that due to the lack of accurate calculations of shipping schedules and costs for American exports of raw materials, it is difficult to complete orders for May and June between Shanghai and New York.

### Tea Merchants' Loans: Shanghai Branch of the Four Banks Approves More Than 2 Billion Yuan, Still Far Short of the Application Amount. Tea Association is Ready for Establishment.

Tea is a major export product of our country. Due to the upcoming tea season, the tea industry groups have sent telegrams to the Second Plenary Session and Chairman Chiang to request assistance in order to revitalize China's tea industry and strive for international trade. According to agricultural economist (tea industry tycoon) Sun Xiaocun, 23 tea merchants applied to the Shanghai branch of the Four Joint Banks for purchase loans, using tea, gold, and real estate as collateral. The total application amount reached 4.2 billion yuan. The Shanghai branch of the Four Joint Banks has discussed it at a routine meeting. However, the Four Joint Banks hope to only use tea as collateral. Although it has been approved, the total approved amount is only more than 2 billion yuan, and it has been submitted by the Shanghai branch of the Four Joint Banks to the head office for approval. However, the number is extremely small, which is far from the current national loan amount of 100 billion yuan. Therefore, applications are still being actively pursued. It is also learned that in order to revitalize China's tea, develop foreign trade, and assist the government's economic construction, tea industry tycoons Shou Jingwei, Wu Juenong, Ye Shichang, Wang Zhenhuan, and Sun Xiaocun have launched the organization of the China Tea Association. After two joint meetings of the preparation members, the preparations are basically in place, and members are being publicly solicited recently. It is heard that the inaugural meeting is scheduled to be held in Shanghai on April 1. In the future, national tea merchants will have a sound and unified organization, and it is understood that they will participate in the first post-war World Tea Exhibition held in London, England this autumn.

### Foreign Companies Accept Orders, Great Progress in American-Made Spinning Machines, 400,000 Spindles Have Been Ordered

The war industries of the United States, Britain, and other countries have mostly shifted to general production and manufacturing industries. Machines can be exported in a short period of time, so foreign companies in China are becoming more active and have begun to accept orders. It is heard that the larger industrial machinery transactions in Shanghai are for textile machinery, such as Weili Han Shenchang of the United States and Anli and Ping of Britain, each of which has orders for sale. American-made spinning machines have made progress in manufacturing technology, with simple and flexible machine components and processes. The progress is that the drafting is changed to large drafting, and the steel collar of the spinning machine is also enlarged to two inches and two and four-tenths inches. In the spinning part, the process was originally three times, but now it can be used only once to the spinning machine. The production volume of this new type of spinning machine is 20% higher than that of the various spinning machines ten years ago (based on the standard of spinning 20-count yarn, one spindle can produce 1.2 pounds of yarn per 24 hours). The saving of labor is half less than the previous type (the former type machine requires 300 direct labor per 10,000 spindles, while the new machine only needs 150). It is heard that British textile experts have recently traveled to the United States to conduct inspections to borrow money, because American-made spinning machines have the above-mentioned advantages, and the price is also higher than British-made machines. Each 10,000 spindles (flower clearing, steel wire, combing, roving, spinning complete set) is priced at 450,000 US dollars, delivered in ten months (this is the fastest delivery for foreign machines), and freight and insurance are borne by the buyer. British-made spinning machines are cheaper, each 10,000 spindles is 80,000 to 90,000 pounds, but the delivery period takes about 30 months to start loading. As for the ordering procedures, British and American merchants are mostly similar. After the ordering party signs an ordering agreement with each line, they will fulfill the agreement and handle it. A deposit of 15% is paid at the time of ordering, 25% is paid when manufacturing starts, and 60% is paid after manufacturing is completed, test-driven and boxed.

The Swiss Ritter spinning machine factory also has an agent in Shanghai that can accept orders, but because the delivery time cannot be determined, there are few buyers. British and Indian merchants who operate the textile machinery industry in India also have representatives coming to Shanghai to sell old-fashioned spinning machines left in India. The price is slightly cheaper than new-style machines. It is heard that several factories in this city have negotiated with them, and a deal may be signed in the short term. It is found that the major textile enterprises in our country have ordered more than 400,000 yarn spindles from the United States and Britain in the past six months, of which Shenxin purchased the most, about 170,000 spindles. Yufeng Yarn Factory and Yuhua system factories have also ordered a lot. The number of people who are now negotiating is becoming more and more active. According to a textile expert, the output of this old type of spinning machine is weak and consumes labor. After the American and British new machines are shipped to China and installed in large quantities, they will inevitably become scrap iron within three or five years. Therefore, ordering manufacturers should carefully consider.

### Hangzhou Normal School A Full-Scale Brawl

Flying Stone Breaks Principal's Head

[Our Hangzhou Correspondent] A major disturbance occurred at the Hangzhou Normal School yesterday (the 17th) at 4:00 PM. It is reported that during a school affairs meeting the day before yesterday, when discussing the issue of teachers' overdue public grain and newly collected student meal expenses, the school principal, Zhu Wenzhi, insisted that the overdue public grain for teachers would not be issued and that the newly collected student meal fees would continue to be increased. All the teachers believed that since the overdue public grain had already been received by the school, it should be issued as usual, and that the student meal fees should not be arbitrarily increased because most of the students at the school were poor and could not afford it, in accordance with the Ministry's order. This led to a heated debate. In the end, Principal Zhu's arrogant attitude led to an argument with the teachers on the spot, and they parted unhappily, with no results from the meeting. Yesterday at 4:00 PM, when the school was about to have dinner, Principal Zhu summoned all the students for a speech, but his words seemed unreasonable. Some students went on stage to argue, but unexpectedly, a full-scale brawl broke out. Principal Zhu's head was hit by a flying stone, and the director of student affairs immediately covered his head with his hand, which was stained with blood. Seeing the situation was not good, Principal Zhu took the opportunity to leave. The students of the school urgently convened an emergency meeting of the student council, and have been on strike since yesterday. If a reasonable solution is not reached, they plan not to resume classes. It is also reported that Principal Zhu was injured in the head and was immediately taken to the Provincial Hospital for treatment, and the Education Department has been requested to send personnel to investigate thoroughly.

### Standards for Establishing Private Middle Schools Require Sufficient Funds to Cover Recurring Expenses; Different from Standards Set Before the War

[Our Nanjing Correspondent] Before the Anti-Japanese War, the Ministry of Education's standards for assets and capital (funds) required for the establishment of private schools in various provinces and cities were based on the lower cost of living and stable prices at the time, and specific amounts were set, such as 50,000 or 100,000 yuan, deposited in banks. Upon verification, if the amounts were found to be consistent, the establishment was approved. During the Anti-Japanese War, due to the increased cost of living and fluctuating prices, it was difficult to maintain consistent living standards across different regions. Therefore, a uniform amount for the educational fund could not be set. Instead, a principle was established, allowing the education departments of various provinces and cities to set their own standards based on local conditions and this principle, in order to ensure suitability and avoid difficulties. The principle is that any application to establish a private middle school must demonstrate that the normal interest income from its assets and capital (i.e., the educational fund) is sufficient to cover the recurring expenses of the school before the establishment can be approved. The Ministry of Education stated: As living conditions vary in different regions and prices are subject to change, the amount of assets and capital should also be increased with the times. The local educational administrative authorities should set the standard that is sufficient to cover the school's operating expenses according to the above-mentioned principles set by the Ministry.

### Today's Basketball League Shantou Team Faces Enkas

South China Fights Jiangwan

The A and Women's groups of the basketball league are coming to an end. There are two games starting at 6:30 PM today, both of which are Division A matches. The Shantou team will play Enkas, and South China will play Jiangwan. Tickets are still 500 yuan. The order is as follows:

Shantou Team—Enkas (A1) 6:30 PM

South China—Jiangwan (A1) 7:30 PM

Since Ma Canxi left Shanghai, the Shantou team's performance has inevitably declined, as they lack a central figure. Enkas is known for its courage, so the Shantou team should make more use of strategy. South China has been improving recently, and newcomer He Hanfu, after several training sessions, has gradually been able to perform well. Today's match against Jiangwan will definitely be intense and exciting.

Educational Thesis

### Review of Elementary School Art Curriculum Standards

— Wen Zhaotong

The Ministry of Education announced the "Revised Elementary School Art Curriculum Standards" in July of the 25th year of the Republic of China (1936). At that time, I published a review article in the Jiangsu Provincial Elementary School Teachers' Semi-Monthly Journal, Volume 4, Issue 5, pointing out its characteristics: (1) starting from local culture; (2) developing children's creative abilities as much as possible; (3) aiming at the application of daily life. Recently, I saw the "Elementary School Drawing Curriculum Standards" announced in October of the 31st year of the Republic of China (1942), and compared it with the former. I seem to have discovered a regression in Chinese elementary school art education, which is also the motivation for me to write this article.

In the revision process, it was said that "the elementary school curriculum is the center of all educational facilities in elementary school, including the guidance of the entire children's life, and is not narrowly defined as the education of a certain subject." It also said: "According to the definition of the above curriculum, the curriculum of the elementary school department of national education can be analyzed into three major trainings: (1) moral training, (2) physical training, (3) cognitive training. That is, the entire education facility of elementary school should take the three major trainings of morality, physique, and intelligence as the central goal." Therefore, "Fine Arts" was changed to "Drawing" and incorporated into "Knowledge and Skills."

Since the major premise has been determined in this way, the drawing curriculum has become the following content:

(1) Emphasize technical training;

(2) Emphasize basic exercises;

(3) Cancel research assignments;

(4) Disregard the beautification of life.

For the sake of economic space, I don't want to specifically excerpt the content, but I always have a few questions: In the teaching material outline, in the third item of the third and fourth grades, it is stipulated that "use drawing books to compile the most basic drawing methods," isn't this going to fall into the danger of copying?

Secondly, the teaching essentials also stipulate that "basic drawing exercises should be started in the lower grades." Implementing it in this way requires children in the lower grades to draw correctly and skillfully, which not only violates learning psychology. Furthermore, I want to ask: With such training, will every citizen possibly become a technically skilled painter? The result is indeed a waste.

What exactly is the purpose of elementary school art education? If you only want to train drawing skills, then this "Drawing Curriculum Standards" published in this revision may be more reasonable, but what we require of every child is to have an eye to distinguish between beauty and ugliness, a skill to beautify life, as for the development of creativity, after all, it is a secondary position. Moreover, merely having stereotyped basic technical exercises will inhibit self-expression and free creation.

If implemented according to such standards, it is very likely to completely frustrate and eliminate the human nature of loving beauty and the interest in aesthetics. What role does the training of rigid painters play in the entire national education? Finally, my opinion is that "Fine Arts" should be restored in the middle and high grades, and "Work" should be restored in the lower grades to expand the scope of operations. It would be best to combine the life crafts with artistic properties in "Manual Arts" to form a complete "Formative Education" system, using "cultivating appreciation" and "developing creation" as means, so that every citizen can improve their own lives to tend to beautification. I strongly oppose technical training, especially starting from the lower grades. Because "drawing technique" is definitely not the core of modern art education, it is also far from "life curriculum" and "behavior curriculum." Rather than taking "drawing" as a training in "knowledge and skills," it is better to restore "Fine Arts" and use it as a training in "moral behavior."

### Talks with Endner: Our Reporter: China is Stepping onto a Turning Point, Should Open its Doors

"Mr. Endner is not seeing visitors."

A nurse in the Hong En Hospital "office" told me this. I said to her: I am a reporter. Didn't Mr. Endner receive newspaper reporters yesterday?

She laughed and said, "But he is not seeing visitors 'today'."

I said, I want to try. She said I could go to the third floor and try my luck.

On the doorknob of room 300 on the third floor hung a sign with two large characters written in red ink: "No Vnaitoro"!

I thought: It doesn't matter if I get rejected anyway, so I'll give it a try. A Chinese nurse happened to come out of the ward, so I asked her to hand my business card in. She said, "The hospital is in disarray, and visitors are only allowed from 2 to 4 PM. I think you should come at noon."

It doesn't matter if I get rejected, luck will eventually come.

She finally handed in my business card. When she came out, she said, "Mr. Endner can see you."

Mr. Endner was lying high in bed, his back propped up with pillows. He was wearing a gray cardigan with a Chinese-style front, his complexion was quite ruddy, and his eagle eyes behind his glasses sparkled. On the small table in front of him were a cup of steaming coffee, a glass of water, some blank paper, and a pencil. The paper was already covered in hasty writing. Two English newspapers were scattered on the quilt. The room was warmly heated, and Mr. Endner seemed to be in a good mood.

He said, "I feel much more comfortable today. I was really tired yesterday—really tired. The flight wasn't very long, and the plane was very comfortable, but my..." He gently patted his left chest and coughed. This cough was a symptom of his illness. He said, "I wanted to come a long time ago. I struggled to get out of bed only last Friday and took the plane at 8 PM."

He had apparently read the news in the paper that Madame Chiang Kai-shek was sending a special plane to see him, and a satisfied smile appeared on his face when he mentioned it. He really wanted to see Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, but, he murmured, "The Chairman—he's too busy."

Is China Doing Well? Endner Doesn't Dare to Say

Talking about the current situation in China, he said excitedly, "I have been in China for forty-three years, and every day I have longed to see a free China. Now I have finally seen it, and I feel truly relieved! China's current opportunity is once in a lifetime, but can I say that everything is going smoothly? I dare not say. China is at a turning point. It can be said that it can become a strong and prosperous country, but it is not without the possibility of failure. The most important thing is that the rulers must have vision. If I were the ruler of China, the most important thing to do right now is very simple: don't hold narrow prejudices, open the door. China must rely on foreign capital! You have to rely on foreigners to work for you, you should give them some benefits, let them do business and make money in peace."

Li Guochin of Huachang Company Achieves Success in America

He continued, "When the United States was first founded, it also absorbed foreign capital. The first railways in the United States were invested in by British merchants! I saw a tall building in Long Island, Long Island, with large Chinese characters written on it: 'Huachang Trading Company.' The manager is called Li Guochin. They have their own factory, which is very large. During the entire war, they independently undertook all the production entrusted by the US government. Of course, they can have profits, and they have great profits, but they also helped the US government, and the Americans are grateful to them. China also needs a group of these foreign merchants to solve the current difficulties and enable the people to enjoy a better life. Can they still hold on to the narrow anti-foreign ideas of the Boxers of that year?" He clenched his fists excitedly, and in a speech-like posture, said, "You more progressive young reporters should understand this clearly. When it is time to speak, speak up. When it is time to fight for something, fight for it!"

He coughed violently, but the passionate fire burning in his eyes made him suddenly seem younger.

Currently Writing Memoirs, Getting Harder and Harder

I asked him about Salley and his writing of memoirs. He said, "Salley is also a reporter. I got to know him because he came to interview me. I certainly remember a lot of things from the past forty-three years, but a large part of the truth must be kept secret. In Honolulu, three doctors told me: I won't get better. But, even if—" He paused and said dejectedly, "I still can't say. This book, I have already written more than half of it, but it is getting harder and harder to write, and I'm afraid it won't be able to be completed."

We talked about the Xi'an Incident. I said, "You were truly a hero in that incident." He laughed and said, "Zhang Xueliang is indeed not a bad person. Now, it should be time to let him out!"

When I said goodbye, his handshake was firm and strong, and his voice of thanks was still loud and clear, not at all like that of someone suffering from a serious illness. I knew he was struggling—this old man who would never show weakness!

The nurse told me that the doctors currently responsible for treating him are Dr. Blumenfield, a female doctor from Dellfan, and Chen Zongmo, a former surgical expert from Nanjing Central Hospital. Mr. Endner is in good spirits, but he eats very little, only eating bread, oatmeal, and a little soup. I think the next time I come, they probably won't say "Mr. Endner is not seeing visitors" anymore.

### UNRRA's Secretary-General Mooney in Hangzhou

— Our Newspaper Hangzhou Tenth Day Airmail News, Sent by Sheng Chengshi

With the cooperation of the UNRRA Headquarters, the national relief and rehabilitation effort is gradually unfolding. Mr. Mooney, the Executive Secretary-General of the UNRRA Department, has been ordered by Director Li Meng of the UNRRA to inspect Europe and Asia. After completing his observation in Europe, Mr. Mooney flew to Shanghai on the 26th of last month, stepping onto the first country in Asia. At noon on March 4th, the Shanghai-Hangzhou express train carried this guest from afar, first arriving in Hangzhou, the Zhe-Min District. When the train stopped at the platform, a Canadian in his forties, of medium build with a plump face, stepped out of the carriage. He was Mr. Mooney, representing the UNRRA to assist millions of our suffering compatriots. He brought the enthusiasm of the people of the United Nations to comfort the twenty million compatriots in Zhejiang who had suffered from disasters for eight years.

Children Sing Welcome Songs in the Righteous People Transportation Station

During his short two-day stay in Hangzhou, he participated in the work conference of the Executive Yuan and UNRRA, and was quite satisfied with the spirit of close cooperation between the two parties. When inspecting the Righteous People Transportation Station, he carefully examined the actual conditions of food and lodging in the station. The children raised in the station sang two songs, "Long Live China" and "America is Our Good Friend," to welcome this guest. After inspecting the flour retail outlets and other relief efforts, he visited Chairman Huang of the Provincial Government, representing his Secretary-General, and Mayor Zhou of the Municipal Government, expressing his great pleasure that the provincial and municipal authorities could work together to promote relief efforts. Secretary-General Li specifically requested the UNRRA to help with the two projects of urgently repairing the seawall and restoring the Changxing Coal Mine. Mr. Mooney said that he would personally inspect the seawall, and that in terms of the coal mine, he could help with machinery and personnel after receiving the plan. Mr. Mooney also visited the two major constructions in the province—the Qiantang River Bridge and the Zhakou Power Plant.

A List of Supplies, Promised to Provide as Much as Possible

At a luncheon, Mr. Mooney talked about the destruction of rice shops in Hangzhou last month due to the rice shortage. He said, "Two or three days after the disturbance, the Zhe-Min branch immediately shipped large amounts of flour from Shanghai and immediately held sales at low prices, which quickly dropped the price of flour from over 9,000 yuan per bag to 6,500 yuan. Because countless poor people benefited, the people's hearts were stabilized, which is exactly the purpose that we relief workers are trying to achieve." He also said, "Before leaving Washington to China, the UNRRA and the general American people believed that Chinese agriculture was backward and that chemical fertilizers had never been used, so shipping chemical fertilizers to China would be a waste of resources. After much proof from the UNRRA, the Executive Yuan, and agricultural experts, they finally realized that this view was wrong." He asked UNRRA to ship large amounts of chemical fertilizers to help China. Mr. Mooney's frank and straightforward attitude was deeply touching. It's regrettable that he couldn't inspect the entire Zhejiang Province, otherwise he would have a deeper understanding of the disasters in Zhejiang and Fujian. Fortunately, Director-General Sun has submitted to him a large list of relief supplies needed by the two provinces, and Mr. Mooney promised to provide as much relief as possible.

Inspect the Seawall Project Along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway

When he returned to Shanghai, in order to see the seawall and the highway for transporting supplies in the future, he took a "Jeep" along the Shanghai-Hangzhou highway on the morning of the 6th, inspecting the emergency repair project of the seawall in Haining, Haiyan, Zhapu. This seawall, which is related to the survival of the people in the southeast, was deeply imprinted in his mind before arriving in Hangzhou. We inspected while getting out of the car in Haining and other places. In total, there were twelve breaches along the way, the smallest was half a li long, and the largest was more than six li long. Mr. Mooney carefully inspected and took many photos near the stone tablet engraved with the "Dan" character of the Thousand Character Classic, which was also a large breach.

Shouldn't be Called Relief, Should be Called Repayment

In the car, Mr. Mooney also mentioned China's contribution in the entire anti-fascist war. He said, "The weight of the sacrifice is incomparable to any country in the United Nations, yet the Chinese people are still enduring suffering and burying themselves in the work of revival, without loudly appealing to the UNRRA. This great spirit is too moving." "Canadian women are loudly shouting: Because they sacrificed so much that they don't even have stockings to wear, they must ask the UNRRA for a large amount of assistance. In fact, Chinese women not only have no stockings to wear, but most of them are also barefoot!" He waved his fist and continued, "So this time I feel that the UNRRA's assistance to China should not be called relief, but repayment." He also said happily, "Zhejiang is the hometown of the great leader Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. In order to respect Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and the people under his leadership, we should make Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's hometown—Zhejiang! Make it more beautiful."

UNRRA Annual Meeting to be Held in China Next Spring

The jeep drove on the muddy and uneven Shanghai-Hangzhou highway. The journey that only took four and a half hours before the war took us twelve hours. We arrived in Shanghai at 8 PM. If the bridges and roads are not improved, driving is very dangerous. At present, it is probably impossible to use this highway to transport large amounts of supplies. When saying goodbye upon arrival in Shanghai, Mr. Mooney smiled and said to the reporter, "I admire West Lake, please convey my regards to Chairman Huang, Secretary-General Li, and Mayor Zhou. I would like to come back to see the beautiful West Lake in the future!" He turned his head and patted the shoulders of the Commissioner Gu and the branch director, saying, "Your director will certainly also help you thank them for me!" We said goodbye, hoping to see each other again, because the annual meeting of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration may be held in China next spring, when Mr. Mooney will come to our country again.

### The Jin City That is Both Quiet and Dynamic

— Our Newspaper Seventh Day Airmail News, Sent by Zhou Yangquan

(Emerald green and bright red) Chengdu, she is a beautiful and quiet city. Anyone who has been to Chengdu will naturally have the same feeling. Chengdu, she has the grandeur of Beijing and the charm of Jiangnan. If you don't believe it, you can climb the West City Wall. Looking into the distance, you can see the lush green trees in the city, interspersed with snow-white plum blossoms and bright red winter plums. All the pavilions and houses are appearing amidst the emerald green and bright red. You can see a dense wheat field and yellow vegetable fields outside the city. The scattered villages are like a painting and a poem. You will naturally praise this green city.

The life of Chengdu people can truly be called extremely quiet and leisurely. How many tea houses and wine shops are crowded with people? Some people can even brew a pot of flower tea in the morning and sit idly in the tea house for the whole day without leaving. And how many people stroll slowly on Chunxi Road and in the commercial area, visiting every store and observing the large and small goods in each store. They are passing the time without doing anything. Even now, although the Lunar New Year has passed a long time ago, there are still stores that haven't opened for business! Strangely enough, this year, decorating the storefronts has become a trend among the stores along Chunxi Road and Citang Street. One store renovates, and every store renovates. Therefore, the business of mud, water, and carpentry is particularly booming this year. Perhaps it is because the War of Resistance has been won, and they are planning for the long term!

(On the Huaxi Dam) The wind of the Xianglian State has drifted into this peaceful city. On the morning of the 24th of this month, tens of thousands of young people gathered from all directions on the Huaxi Dam in the south of the city. They held an unprecedentedly grand gathering in a tragic, passionate, and intense atmosphere. They demanded "Return our Northeast Rivers and Mountains," demanded "Protect North China with Iron Blood," and demanded "The Soviet Union to Abide by the Treaty and Immediately Withdraw Troops from the Northeast." Their purpose is pure, their demands are simple, and their actions are great. At 10:30 AM, they set off from the square to parade and demonstrate.

(Singing of Troop Withdrawal) Their ranks were several miles long. When they passed through every street and alley, the people cheering on both sides of the road numbered in the tens of thousands. Regardless of gender or age, they all shouted slogans, raised their fists, and sang the temporarily composed song requesting the Soviet Union to withdraw its troops: After eight years of resistance, victory is finally achieved, recovering the nine provinces of the Northeast. The people must strive for it. The Soviet Union must withdraw quickly, and must abide by the Sino-Soviet Treaty, to maintain the territorial integrity of the Republic of China, and maintain the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the motherland. The Soviet Union withdraws, the Soviet Union withdraws, keep your promises, keep your promises; Return our nine provinces of the Northeast, return our nine provinces of the Northeast, let's strive together, let's strive together. The large ranks arrived at the gate of the Provincial Government at about 1:00 PM. They stated the motive and purpose of the parade and dispersed in good order. This extraordinary parade shook the people of the entire Jin City awake. The quiet Jin City appeared to be active.

(Sweet Rain Has Not Fallen) Since the beginning of spring, the weather has been clear and mild. In the past two months, sweet rain has not fallen, resulting in high rice prices, but they are still not as high as the price of rapeseed oil, which rises several times a day. In September of last year, 200 yuan could buy one catty of rapeseed oil, but now, it has skyrocketed geometrically. It costs more than 1,000 yuan per catty, and at one point it even rose to 1,400 yuan. The price of rice has also risen from 1,700 yuan per double to 3,400 yuan. The prices of other goods can be imagined. Furthermore, in Anle Temple and Zhengyu Garden, you can see tens of thousands of people moving, and 200 or 300 long snake-like chartered cars lined up in front of the gate. Their owners can jump to become millionaires in a few short hours, or they can become penniless paupers owing millions in debt. That market, that occasion, only smells of human flesh, only smells of the stench of touching paper money. That occasion has a lot of laughter, but even more crying. The time from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM is the moment when people are most crowded. People are wriggling, deceiving, and panicking, living in a thousand changes in an instant. That is a market for various transactions, no, it's a cannibalistic fight of fright! Day after day, month after month, making the quiet Jin City become dynamic.

(A Pit for Spending Gold) Near the Erxian An Temple and Qingyang Palace in Xinximen, the annual flower fair there—actually an industrial fair—moves all of Sichuan. From southern Sichuan, eastern Sichuan, western Sichuan, and northern Sichuan, large and small handicrafts and various businesses have gathered. They rent land and sell their agricultural products and handicrafts. Like Nanjing's Fuzi Temple, Suzhou's Guanqian Street, Beijing's Tianqiao, and Shanghai's Town God Temple, it is a place where people watch people and people squeeze people. It is said that it was originally established as a mutual aid and observation gathering for various industries, but extended to today, it is a pit for spending gold. Tens of thousands of pilgrims and tens of thousands of men, women, and children flock from all directions. Dozens of extra carriages have been added at the entrance of Citang Street to welcome and serve people. It is still only the initial stage recently, and there is already a situation of extreme overcrowding. The people of Chengdu also love to join in the fun. During this month-long flower fair, if you don't go to the fair once, you will surely be seen as a hopeless outdated person. Thus, the quiet Jin City will quickly become dynamic once again.

### My Country's Meteorological Undertakings Enter a Stage of Significant Progress

— Our Newspaper Chongqing Airmail News, Sent by Zhiwei

Since the victory, many institutions that were created due to the needs of the war have been successively abolished. At the same time, there are also several construction institutions that are busy planning the development of their business in order to participate in this great nation-building work. The Central Meteorological Bureau is an institution established during the War of Resistance. The temporary bureau site is near Central University in Shapingba, Chongqing, at Gaojia Garden, but its tasks are becoming increasingly heavy due to the unfolding of the nation-building cause. The meteorological undertaking is a scientific undertaking that explores the conditions of the atmosphere and predicts future weather. Its purpose is similar to that of the geological undertaking in exploring underground treasures and the marine undertaking in exploring the water world. Due to the close relationship between weather and human life, the meteorological undertaking is not only related to military affairs, but also relied upon by national economy and people's livelihood construction, such as the abundance of agricultural products, the safety of sea and air transportation, and national health issues, none of which do not require predicting future weather changes.

However, to complete this objective, it is necessary to have centralized management and densely distributed weather stations, otherwise, all efforts will be in vain. The authorities of our government, in view of this, established the Central Meteorological Bureau in the autumn of the 30th year. However, during the War of Resistance, most of the weather stations in the country fell into the hands of the enemy, and transportation was blocked. The deployment of talents and the replenishment of equipment could not be properly handled.

At present, the most urgent work of the bureau is to adjust the weather stations across the country, unify standards, and centralize management. Those run by the enemy and puppets must be recovered. For example, the Shanghai Bund Signal Station has been received by the bureau and reorganized into the Shanghai Meteorological Observatory. In the future, the station can be responsible for supplying meteorological information along the coast. The meteorological undertaking in Taiwan has been taken over by Shi Yanhan, Director of the Fujian Provincial Meteorological Bureau, nearby, and is working as usual. In addition, meteorological institutions in North China and Northeast China are also being received by appointed personnel.

My country originally lacked meteorological talents. Meteorological technicians who have served in various places for many years and have made outstanding achievements are now heard that the bureau plans to register them for use in the near future, and will separately train them to instill new technologies.

### Carefully Planned by British Architects, Great London is About to be Realized

[Report from our Translation Department] London is truly too small. London's population is equivalent to Columbia's. But its area is only one-fifth of Columbia's. One-sixth of the entire British population is crammed into London and its suburbs. It is not only the seat of government, but also the most important port in Britain, the hub of British industry and commerce, the largest commercial port in Britain, and a center of academia and culture. It is the heart of Britain, but its development has been so abnormal that it seems the body cannot bear this huge "heart."

London's Development Spans Two Thousand Years

When London was originally built, no one thought it would become the center of a modern nation as it is today. It is like an organism that has slowly grown over two thousand years to become what it is now. When the Romans came to Britain in 55 BC, it was originally just a scattered settlement of Celtic natives. The Romans built city walls and Roman-style cities here, giving it the name "Londinium." As Rome declined, the city flourished under Saxon rule, and the area outside the city gradually became lively. By the 16th century, it had become one of the leading commercial ports in Europe. In 1666, a great fire in the city destroyed countless buildings, but within a few years, it quickly revived, with all the buildings rebuilt in the old style, with narrow streets and small courtyards for each house.

A Map of London Resembles a Spider

At the same time, London was expanding rapidly. Queen Elizabeth and other monarchs repeatedly tried to stop the city's expansion, but to no avail. By the 18th and 19th centuries, London had spread to neighboring counties, swallowing up many small towns and villages, and its population increased dramatically, breaking world historical records. Londoners built houses as much as possible along railways and highways, and the map of London became somewhat like a spider.

Generally, people with knowledge felt that such abnormal expansion was inappropriate. They believed that the city had absorbed too much population. In a large place like America, a city as large as London would not necessarily be top-heavy, but Britain is much smaller than America, so this development quickly became a problem. Many excellent farmlands have been built upon. Britain is densely populated, and most of its food needs to be imported from abroad. Such a sacrifice of arable land is a great loss.

Curved Lanes Become Broad Streets

Indeed, London's present state cannot obscure the merits of its predecessors' planning and management. After the Great Fire of 1666, Sir Christopher Wren built fifty churches in the city, with towering spires, which were very beautiful. Many squares are also unmatched by the capitals of other countries. In the early 19th century, the engineer Nash designed many streets leading to Buckingham Palace, which are beautiful and antique, and are still a feature of London today. In recent decades, roads have been widened, and many dilapidated old houses have been demolished. The crowded and winding alleys of the past have now become broad streets, lined with neat and impressive mansions.

Warehouses Set Up Near the Palace, Smoke Blows into Residences

However, London is so important in Britain and has been prosperous for so many years that the value of land is naturally extremely high, and no one is willing to redesign it while ignoring the current situation. As a result, magnificent new thoroughfares are often followed by dilapidated and narrow alleys. Factories and coal smoke often blow into the vicinity of the palace. Although this phenomenon is quite common in European countries and even the United States, the British government, especially in recent years, has deeply felt that this mixed situation tarnishes the capital of the British Empire.

The Most Tragic Bombing is a Good Opportunity for Reconstruction

German bombs have completed the work that people wanted to do but were unwilling to do in peacetime. From the winter of 1940, for five years, London was constantly attacked by rockets, incendiary bombs, and other bombs, and many historical sites and streets became rubble. Apart from Tokyo and Berlin, London suffered the most severe bombing among the world's capitals. The British government immediately seized this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and decided to rebuild, replan, and re-determine the management of this metropolis for its future development.

A Brand New Posture Will Be Seen by the World

Professor Abercrombie formulated a plan in 1944 and wrote a special book, which was enthusiastically discussed by architects and engineering experts throughout Britain. According to this plan, there will be a central area called "the City of London"; a larger area around it called "Greater London"; and an area outside that called "Great London." It is expected that this two-thousand-year-old metropolis will appear before the people of the world in a brand new posture. (Translated by Ping)

### British Female Scientist Mrs. Needham Worked in a Low House on the Banks of the Jialing River

Mrs. Needham, a scientist at Cambridge University, has completed her two-year service at the Sino-British Science Cooperation Office in China and has returned home. Her husband, Dr. Needham, is the director of the Sino-British Science Cooperation Office.

The Central Social Integration Center maintained by the British Council is located on a mountain ridge higher than the Jialing River in Chongqing. In this low house with white ants on the splints, countless new scientific models, magazines, reprints, boxes of instruments and chemicals, packages of special seeds and seedlings, and materials specially prepared for Chinese scientists who longed for information during the war in Britain and 鯿特地 passed through, as well as reports of Chinese scientists' research work and agricultural materials, arrived in Britain for scientists to use.

The work of the Sino-British Science Cooperation Office is not limited to Chongqing. All staff members traveled long distances by truck, visiting universities and scientific institutions in sparsely populated areas. The Needhams and two young Chinese scientists traveled thousands of kilometers north from Chongqing to the provinces of Shaanxi and Gansu. On the way, they encountered floods, which forced them to abandon the truck and wade to nearby hills.

In Baoji, Shaanxi, the Needhams and their party saw many things from scientific professors, for example: Henan University, founded in Kaifeng fifteen years ago, had suffered four times from Japanese invasion. The school taught in the Er Cun Zhuang Temple in Baoji, and professors and heavy duties lived in nearby farmhouses or valleys. The school had moved several boxes of instruments hundreds of miles by coolies, but lacked a laboratory opened by 摥. There were no scientific books in the library, because all scientific books had been destroyed by the Japanese. The clothes of teachers and students had also been sacrificed, so they all wore summer clothes in winter, and everyone hoped to get a brocade robe for relief. After the victory, news came that the school buildings had been severely damaged and transportation was difficult, and the school felt that it was difficult to restore the school. The enthusiasm during the war became a bubble.

On this trip, the Needhams traveled north to the Soil Conservation Institute of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry in Gansu Province, where the work was very good. In addition, they also visited the Forest Protection Institute and the Shaanxi Provincial 生 Experimental Institute, which began as early as 1932 to defend against the cholera epidemic that was prevalent at the time.

The above-mentioned places only represent a part of the visits of the Sino-British 篳門閨竇 Cooperation Office. The museum has done its best to adapt to the needs of Chinese scientists, although the amount of supply represents the heart of the people of Western Europe. Since the war has ended, the British Council will be able to more actively develop science and international relations with the close cooperation of Sino-British scientists. (3.15. London Electric)

### The Racecourse Should Be Made a Park

Editor:

How should members of society use their leisure time? On the surface, it seems unimportant, but in fact, if leisure time is used improperly, not only will the social etiquette and customs decline, but the scope of life will also change accordingly. Therefore, appropriate public entertainment planning is an essential task for municipal planners.

It is heard that the racecourse in this city will hold another horse race in January of this year, and speculators are overjoyed. Horse racing is originally a kind of sport abroad, with prize horse racing, in order to promote the spirit of sports, but Shanghai is not the case. Not only can it not incorporate sports into horse racing, but it makes citizens increase their luck-seeking psychology and engage in gambling activities. The result will inevitably increase the opportunity for depravity, and the social situation will be chaotic and more complicated, which is harmful and useless.

The streets in Shanghai are narrow and the houses are crowded. There is a lack of land, which leads to turbid air. The parks in major cities in the world account for one-tenth of the total area of the city, but the area of land in this city is less than 4%. Now that the concession has been recovered, the construction has just begun, and the municipal authorities of this city are planning a modern municipal city lacking. If the land is acquired and opened to the public, then the center of this city can also have a relatively spacious place for citizens to visit and exercise, then the city appearance can be started from here, and can be gradually rectified. I deeply hope that the municipal authorities will study this. If it can be realized, it will indeed be a blessing for the citizens of this city. Zhang (Yongling, 3.15.)

Our country's eight-year war of resistance has exhausted its vitality, and all construction has been destroyed. At this time of waiting for everything to be rebuilt, the people should save money and food to assist local construction. Unexpectedly, since this spring, in the area of ​​western Zhejiang (especially Haining County), there is still a group of local ruffians who instigate unemployed people to launch a meeting. Not only does it cost money and labor, but it also tramples on spring flowers. It has already played out and violated the principles of the New National Movement. The county authorities, in addition to official articles and notices to prohibit it, do not see any other specific measures to stop it. The township offices do not ask or hear about it, and some even lose their assistance and collude with each other! Now some temples have already posted "strips of meeting translation", which shows that there is a "trend that arrows are on the string and cannot be fired". I think there are many similar situations in various places, confusing the attention of the authorities, and strictly ordering the provincial and county governments to take practical and effective measures! (Fang Gong) (March 13)

Spring and Autumn

### Remembering the Poet Yang Yunshi

— Tang Liyan

Alas, the poet Mr. Yang Yunshi has passed away. It is said that when Ziqi died, Boya never played the zither again for the rest of his life. Moreover, Mr. Yang wrote about the pain of his family and country with a pen like an oak tree, with deep and desolate feelings, directly approaching the High Tang Dynasty. He combined the bones of Du Fu and the appearance of Li Bai, and even Mei Cun and Shou Zhai should bow their hands to him. There has been no such work in the past three hundred years. Literature is about to be lost, and philosophy is withering. Therefore, the passing of Mr. Yang is not only a feeling of losing a zither, is it?

I met Mr. Yang at the beginning of 1938. At that time, Hangkou had just fallen, and famous scholars gathered in Xianghai. I had long admired Mr. Yang, and through the introduction of Mr. Shao Quanshi, I was able to meet him at Kowloon Ying Wangzi Road. We talked all day long and never got tired of it. Seeing his handsome and refined appearance, I imagined Zhang Xu in his youth, which made people admire him very much. Since then, we have visited each other from time to time. We talked about everything in the world and discussed poetry and literature until midnight. One day, Mr. Yang visited, and Xie Wu Liang happened to be there. I introduced them to each other, and they both felt like they had met late. So we went to the Yangjing Restaurant together, and the Hu Ji pressed wine, filling the store with fragrance. Although there was no poem about the Yellow River rising far away, the heroic feelings and uninhibited interest were no less than when painting on the wall of the Qiting.

My poetry and lyrics have always been without a teacher. When I was teaching at Xiamen University in 1926 and 1927, I met Mr. Chen Shiyi. I asked to study under him as a disciple, and Mr. Yang smiled and said, "The trouble with people is that they like to be teachers," so he wrote after correcting my clumsy manuscript:

"With the style of Jian Zhai, write the beautiful thoughts of Zhong Ze. The lyrics are like Qin Liu, and they are often outstanding. Looking at the ancient and modern poems together, they are also the descendants of Wen Wei, Du Fan Chuan."

Since then, I dared to engage in this learning. And poverty also depends on running around for food and clothing, or working hard on the desk, or the podium has many accidents. After drinking and before the dignity, I occasionally do it. When I made friends with Mr. Yun Shi, Mr. Yang asked for my recent works, and I recorded dozens of them to advance. Mr. Yang brought it back with him and returned it on a different day. Ying wrote a note saying:

"There is a clear thought, and his dashing talent is expressed with a brilliant pen. Therefore, he can digest the ancient and transform it, and the paper makes a sound. It is a talented person's pen, and it is a passionate person's words. When sitting with famous flowers and beautiful women to read it, you know the wisdom of the lyricist. I admire Yuanliang."

Mr. Yang especially praised my line "Under the air raid in Hankou, watching the Qin Huai singing and dancing with swords and singing," saying that it could compete with Mei Cun. Both gentlemen spared no effort to praise and encourage the younger generation, which is commendable. Now they have both passed away, and my learning has not made any progress. Every time I think about it, I cannot help but feel ashamed.

Mr. Yang's poetry is like Mei Cun's, but his painting is covered by his poetic name, which is also like Mei Cun's. One day, I asked Mr. Yang for a poem on the head of a fan. Mr. Yang drew a plum blossom, with old branches stretching horizontally and sparse branches scattered, and a vigorous style, which was also very charming. The meaning of Jin Dongxin is not more than that. And he wrote two seven-character quatrains:

"Write the plum blossoms and give them to you. The dreams of sorrow in Jiangnan are chaotic. Luofu is close, and Gushan is far away. The soul of poetry is everywhere in the chaotic waters and clouds.

The monkeys and cranes in the old mountain hate to be hazy. The dreams of Jianghu are no longer everywhere. The red calyx also knows how to endure the wind and snow, and endure death for people to wait for the return of spring."

At that time, everyone present had no home to return to, and they were filled with emotion. I forced a smile and said, "The people by the stove are like jade, and their wrists are condensed with frost and snow. Don't return to your hometown when you are not old, and you must break your heart when you return to your hometown." And I went to the restaurant upstairs. Now the essence still exists, but the poet has passed away, and he cannot endure death for a moment to wait for the return of spring?

The mountains and rivers of Kowloon are beautiful, and the seawater of Song Wangtai is swallowed up and mourned. (Song Wangtai is the place where Emperor Zhao Bing was martyred in Yai Shan.) The Qingshan Temple is vast in the clouds, which are enough to evoke the feelings of the past, and the Thousand Buddha Mountain is even better. On good days in spring and autumn, we followed Mr. Yang's staff and visited everywhere. One day, we went to the Thousand Buddha Temple. The monks in the temple were still not vulgar, and they held up inkstones and asked for a poem. Shao Quanshi first completed a five-character quatrain, and I wrote a seven-character ancient poem:

"I came to worship Buddha on Qianfo Mountain, and Qianfo Mountain is in the mountains. Clouds and Xia are bright and dark or can be seen, and thousands of Dengs squat and climb. The ten thousand dharmas of Tathagata are unspeakable, and I am free with a smile of a flower. White clouds and flowing water are far away, and the sea is vast and bays repeat."

Mr. Yang smiled and said: "Cui Hao wrote a poem, and Li Bai put down his pen. Today, I should give you a head start." So he did not write it again. Mr. Yang was a famous family in Yu Shan, and his ancestors were officials. He entered Beiguan when he was young, and he was the only one after Zhang Nantong (Jizhi Shi) in Zhongnan Yuan. Therefore, he was appreciated by Li Hefei, the prime minister, and married his eldest granddaughter, Ms. Daoqing. Mrs. Li was virtuous and died early. She was good at writing small orders, and her works were attached to Mr. Yang's Changjiang Wanli Tower poetry and lyrics, which can be read to imagine her style. He remarried Ms. Xu Xiake (Xiake seems to be in contrast to Yun Shi, not stealing from the ancients), who was also intelligent and knowledgeable. Mr. Yang once said, "I chose a master for ten years and got Wu (referring to Wu Ziyu), and I chose a wife for three years and got you (referring to Ms. Xu). What more can I ask for in my life's happiness?" Knowing that his Guanfang's happiness is better than Zhang Chang's. Later, he died of illness in Fuzhou, and Mr. Yang was very sad and wrote a posthumous wife's record, saying that it can be compared with Mao Bijiang's Yingmei An's Memories and Shen Sanbai's Six Records of Floating Life, enough to make three.

Mr. Yang's thinking leans towards conservatism. He was a Langzhong in the Qing Dynasty when he was young (Ministry of Households and Postal Ministry). After entering the Republic of China, he gave up the idea of ​​making progress. Later, he was appreciated by General Wu Ziyu, and he also made it clear that he would only be a staff member and not an official. Therefore, when General Wu was prosperous, he whipped and wrote more than ten provinces, and all the generals and deputy generals were awarded Fangmian. However, Mr. Yang was alone and detached from the world, and he took nothing but his salary. After Yuezhou, the arrears of salary reached tens of thousands, but Mr. Yang was grateful for his knowledge and carried his sword to follow the expedition, opening the customs for thousands of miles. When Wu Gong was defeated and his troops scattered, Mr. Yang still did not leave. Even when he went to Xianghai, he was ordered by Wu Gong to take care of something. The world is declining and morality is falling, and people's hearts are not ancient. Mr. Yang can be considered a model. He can be entrusted with a six-foot orphan, and he can be entrusted with a hundred miles of life. Mr. Yang has it.

Since Mr. Yang was loyal to the Qing Dynasty, he hated Yuan Shikai very much and respected Kang Youwei very much. Kang also regarded him as a national scholar, and once said to Wu Ziyu, "Mr. Yunshi is loyal and bright, and has the demeanor of an ancient famous minister, but he was not born at the right time. It's a pity." At that time, there were clouds of strategists and rain of fierce generals in Wu Gong's curtain, such as Chief Counselor Mr. Zhang Taiyan, Chief of Staff Jiang Baili (Fang Zhen), Secretary-General Zhang Qiheng, Director of Military Affairs Zhang Fulai, Director of Foreign Affairs Zhang Zhitian, Director of Transportation Gao Enhong, etc., were all famous figures at the time. However, General Wu only treated Mr. Taiyan and Mr. Yunshi with respect. He also humbly adopted what they offered. People said that General Wu was arrogant and self-willed, but how could that be the case?

### The Spirit and Atmosphere of Landscape Painting and the Smoke and Clouds

— Shi Chongzhi

When Xie He of the Southern Qi Dynasty critiqued the painters of his time, he noted that only Lu Tanwei and Wei Xie possessed all six elements of painting. Others like Cao Buxing, Zhang Mo, and Xun Xu occasionally had outstanding works that captured the essence in miniature. However, painters of the second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth ranks could only achieve a semblance, possessing merely one or two aspects. This was during a time when landscape painting was not yet prevalent. The six elements were not exclusively for landscape paintings, and Xie He's critiques weren't limited to landscape painters either. However, after Xie He, Zong Bing, Emperor Yuan of Liang, Zhang Yanyuan of the Tang Dynasty, and Guo Ruoxu of the Song Dynasty, among others, fully developed the meaning of the six elements. They applied "qi yun sheng dong" (spirit consonance and life movement) to landscape painting and prioritized it when evaluating the quality of landscape paintings. They regarded planning the composition and accurately depicting forms as the method of creation; representing objects realistically and applying colors accordingly as the technique of expression; and considered the use of brushstrokes and bone structure as merely a means, not worthy of much discussion. Zong Bing said in his Preface to Landscape Painting:

"Responding to the meeting of the senses and understanding the spirit, the spirit transcends and grasps the principle." He determined that painting was entirely a matter of "spirit" and "principle." All painters, when creating, must purify their minds and regulate their qi, achieving a harmonious understanding. Only then can the imposing peaks and misty forests emerge. Only at this level can the spirit and atmosphere be expressed. Emperor Yuan of Liang spoke more concretely in his Landscape Painting and Pine and Rock Styles:

"The name of Heaven and Earth, the spirit of creation, establishes ingenious forms and depicts the landscapes' breadth. One must be lofty and free in thought, skillful in brushstrokes, and refined in ink." This indicates that painters should use techniques to depict nature, and at the same time, possess a noble character and secluded thoughts to achieve skillful brushstrokes and refined ink. Spirit and atmosphere are entrusted in the image of the painting. Zhang Yanyuan's opinions in his Six Principles of Painting also emphasized spirit and atmosphere, regarding formal likeness as not the most pressing matter:

"Ancient paintings disregarded formal likeness but valued inner strength, seeking their artistic quality beyond formal resemblance. Today's paintings may achieve formal likeness but lack spirit and atmosphere. Seeking artistic quality through spirit and atmosphere will naturally result in formal likeness." This explains that spirit and atmosphere are the prerequisites for painting. With spirit and atmosphere, the painting comes alive. Once alive, it achieves the goal of formal likeness. If one focuses solely on formal likeness and lacks cultivation of spirit and atmosphere, one may achieve a lifeless resemblance but lack living spirit and atmosphere. As for Guo Ruoxu's discussion of spirit and atmosphere, he called it "knowing from birth," not something learned:

"The Six Principles are a refined theory, unchanging for all time. However, the five principles below the use of bone structure and brushwork can be learned. As for spirit and atmosphere, it must be known from birth. It cannot be obtained through cleverness or diligence, but through silent understanding and spiritual convergence, unknowing and yet knowing." How exactly does one attain this "knowing from birth"? Compared to Emperor Yuan of Liang's "noble character and profound thought," it is even more abstract. In short, throughout the ages, discussions on landscape painting have consistently emphasized "spirit consonance and life movement." Landscape is the most magnificent phenomenon in nature. Benevolent people delight in mountains, wise people delight in water. Painters take the various scenes of wind, rain, haze, and sunshine in the mountains and rivers as subject matter. The change and concealment of smoke and clouds are even more important embellishments in landscape painting. Since Wang Qia's splash ink technique, Mi Yuanzhang expanded and transformed Dong Yuan's style of "clouds on the mountains" into the Mi School of cloud mountains, paying no attention to paper and brush tools. (Modern painters often utilize fine paper and brushes, some even turning raw paper into prepared paper, which is unnecessarily laborious.) He allowed nature to take its course, refraining from excessive dyeing and blurring. Zhang Yanyuan had a strict critique of painting clouds:

"Ancient people's depiction of clouds was not yet perfect. If they dipped silk in water and dotted it with light powder, they would say it was 'blowing clouds,' even if cleverly done, there would be no trace of brushwork. Yanyuan's idea is particularly good, but it cannot be called a method of learning. As for using splash ink in landscape painting, that is going too far. Splash ink has its own moments of inspiration, but blowing clouds is not worth imitating." He opposed the forced method of blowing clouds. If splash ink is successful, it is another type of ink play, but not the orthodox way of painting clouds. The cloud atmosphere in the mountains varies with the seasons. As Guo Xi said:

"Spring is harmonious, summer is lush, autumn is sparse, winter is dim. When painting, capture their grand essence, and do not be constrained by rigid forms, then the attitude of the clouds will be alive! The haze and mist in landscapes vary with the seasons. Spring mountains are faint and like a smile; summer mountains are verdant and like dripping; autumn mountains are clear and like makeup; winter mountains are bleak and like sleep. When painting, capture their general intent, and do not be constrained by detailed depictions, then the appearance of haze and mist will be correct." All these cloud atmospheres of spring, summer, autumn, and winter cannot be blown out of thin air, or achieved through splash ink alone. It all depends on the artist experiencing the mechanism of nature and depicting it with different brushstrokes and ink in different seasons, arranging different scenes in different seasons. This is what is meant by "responding to the meeting of the senses and understanding the spirit, the spirit transcends and grasps the principle." Therefore, smoke and clouds are not made by dyeing alone, and spirit and atmosphere is not just the meaning of smoke and clouds. The importance lies in the natural breath that emerges from the artist's heart. In addition, there is brush breath, ink breath, air, and vitality, constantly regenerating. Thus, the breath becomes stronger and the rhyme becomes thicker. It should not be confused with the smoke and cloud atmosphere created by ink and water dyeing.

The spirit and atmosphere of landscape painting is different from smoke and clouds, and ink and water dyeing should not be regarded as the standard of smoke and clouds. An overreliance on ink and water dyeing results in mountains always being in the clouds and trees always being in the smoke. At first glance, it seems that the paper is full of smoke and clouds, but upon closer inspection, it is bland and tasteless, frivolous and superficial, and can be called nothing more than a "Jianghu School!" Lin Qinnan once discussed the dyeing of smoke and clouds, expressing it thoroughly:

"The ancients said that in the empty spaces of the mountain corners, the brush enters nothingness, and when the tree shadows are faint, the ink becomes mist. These four sentences have already opened the school of 'Jianghu'. What makes the 'Jianghu' school eye-catching is that it likes to use ink and water to create a cloud-like atmosphere. For the trees, it uses wet brushes and adds flower blue. Regardless of sunny days, it also carries the intention of rain, seeming that mountains must be in the clouds and trees must be in the smoke, thinking that arriving at this atmosphere is to reach a realm of transformation. It is all the same, never leaving the single word 'thin'. But looking at the remaining works of the mountain woodcutters, although they emphasize overlapping peaks, they never use clouds to reflect the scene. One tree and one rock are clearly distinguishable and do not create the atmosphere of smoke and clouds. Because mountains have four seasons, they cannot be dyed with light smoke and dense clouds alone to create a strange structure." These are pearls of wisdom.

Spirit consonance and life movement are indeed the highest standards of painting. Landscape painting is the greatest representative art that depicts nature and entrusts the spirit. It occupies the most important position in painting. To achieve spirit consonance and life movement in landscape painting, one must devote oneself to the five elements below bone structure and brushwork in the Six Principles. At the same time, one must purify one's mind and regulate one's qi, cultivate secluded thoughts, and possess a noble character. The saying that "art can replace religion" also has a cyclical effect related to this purification of the mind and regulation of qi. Dong Qichang's "reading ten thousand volumes of books and traveling ten thousand miles" is nothing more than to rid the mind of all worldly affairs, and only when Qiu He can do that, can he write freely and transmit the spirit of landscape painting.

### Parting Thoughts

— Su Dan

Like a gray migratory bird, flying south and then flying north, flying north and then flying south, forever! A lonely wandering traveler.

Having just stayed in this desolate old temple for two months, tomorrow I must shoulder my heavy baggage again, and an even heavier, heavier heart, full of parting sorrow. He is leaving, for that distant and endless journey!

Although separation is not the first time for me, there is always a little bit of parting sorrow; that much remains.

But what is it that makes me attached? I am attached to the innocent hearts of a group of children, without pretense; without lies, a little warmth of pure and sacred affection.

When Xiaoju and Xiaowei came here this afternoon, they were so sincere and eager to learn. Two pairs of round, eyes, full of the brilliance of life, looked at me and said affectionately:

"Teacher, are you leaving tomorrow?" Why don't you teach us anymore?"

What can I say to them? Even if I said it, would they understand? Would children understand that young people are running for hope? I could only force a smile:

"There will be a better teacher than me to teach you."

But they said, "Teacher, can't you not leave?"

Can I not leave? Even I can't say. I dare not look at their earnest eyes; I think, why should I abandon these children? What is it that I need to pursue by leaving? Is it that flower-like vision?

I grew gloomy, and I didn't know what to say to these children.

Life is urging me, and hope is flickering. Don't blame me for being selfish, but who can give up hope and not pursue it? People live to pursue hope, and pursue hope to live.

In the morning meeting, I told them, I said, "There will always be times of separation between people. We shouldn't always live in a small circle. We must have great ambitions. When you grow up in the future, you must also leave your parents… Leave them and go everywhere to find something that satisfies you. Don't feel sad about leaving home, because your own ambitions and hopes are important…"

Are these words said to them or to myself? I repeated them again. The children's heads drooped down, and silence occupied us.

My own ambitions and hopes are important. I have to fail the children's kind enthusiasm.

The sky darkened, and they said goodbye to me in tears, so reluctantly. Their hands were tightly held by me. How touched I was!

"Don't be sad, I'll come to see you again in the future. Listen to the teacher and go home! Study hard, knowledge is the most precious thing in the world."

They left, but my heart gradually grew heavy. Although I received great sincere affection and warmth, I also have infinite sorrow and longing!

Tomorrow, I will step on the winding road again, walking alone. I will be a wandering traveler again!

Desolate parting! That distant and endless journey.

### Autumns Under the Pen

— Xie Dongping

### "Two Lines"

— Xie Dongping

Geometry approximately defines, "Two parallel lines, can never be together." But, actually two lines with limitless development, will inevitably meet together, because the Earth is an ellipse and not a square.

(I) However, the two lines I want to speak of here are not two parallel lines, but a vertical line and a horizontal line that make up a right angle. The vertical line is the line from top to bottom, which symbolizes autocracy and dictatorship. The horizontal line is the line from left to right or from right to left, which symbolizes democracy.

We can say very affirmatively that the development of history must develop into one or two right angles. To its ultimate end, even the vertical line on the horizontal line will be eliminated, leaving only an infinitely long horizontal line. This horizontal line is made up of countless independent, free, and equal individuals working together. Each independent individual is a certain "point" within this line. In such a society, the rights and obligations of any individual are the same, equal to any point on a parallel line, where their position within that line is exactly the same.

(II) The development of Chinese history is now gradually developing into one or two right angles, but it may also develop into three or four right angles. There is no doubt that the horizontal line is increasing without limit. At the same time, there is no doubt that the vertical line is also struggling hard, both hindering the formation and growth of the horizontal line and seeking to prolong its own life. If a fragile horizontal line is pierced straight through by a fierce vertical line, then the resulting right angle will inevitably be four.

Look, the call for democracy is loud, but the style of doing everything from the top down has not changed. Even the most democratic saying, that "everything should always be from the bottom up," the "top" and "bottom" concepts in this "bottom up" approach are really not truly democratic concepts. This is because in a truly democratic society, there is no distinction between top and bottom. Everyone's status is that of the people, and everyone has the right to be president. To have a fixed "top" and a fixed "bottom," how can that be called democracy?

At present, in China, a historical vertical line and a horizontal line with historical significance are about to meet, or perhaps have already met. We hope that after these two lines meet, and after a period of "neutralization," only one infinitely long horizontal line will remain. Don't let everyone pull it long and form four right angles.

### Staying Together as a Couple (21)

— Zhao Qingge

However, Second Madam Weng grabbed Shi Yulou. She still hadn't understood everything he was thinking in his heart at this moment. She always felt that Shi Yulou was crazy about her. Now that Shi Yulou wanted to leave, it was even more like he was coaxing her. She simply thought she had become Yang Yanhui in "Fourth Son Visits His Mother," and Shi Yulou was Princess Iron Mirror. They seemed to be performing a scene from "Sitting in the Palace."

"Don't worry, my darling! Even if you leave Jingzhou, you can't leave me, so you don't have to think about these things," Second Madam Weng said, patting Shi Yulou's shoulder.

"That's strange, I'm leaving you right away!" Shi Yulou angrily finally said a loud sentence, and then he wanted to push away Second Madam Weng.

"But, I still say the same thing: 'I don't care'!" Second Madam Weng repeated the same words again, and asked him, "Do you understand? Do you understand why I wouldn't care?" Second Madam Weng said, still holding Shi Yulou tightly.

"Why? Because there are so many actors, if I leave today, there will be even better actors coming tomorrow to make you happy. Anyway, you, Second Madam Weng, have plenty of money. You can support this one and then support that one." Shi Yulou said these words in one breath. He felt that it was more difficult than when he usually sang.

Second Madam Weng cried!

"Oh, no wonder you're so angry, so that's what you thought! Then you've wronged my good intentions too much, you silly!"

Hearing Second Madam Weng say this, Shi Yulou was stunned! He tried hard to sort out his already disordered thoughts, and he realized that Second Madam Weng still didn't think what he had originally suspected. But he was still half-believing and half-doubting, saying:

"I don't understand what you mean!"

"Really?" Second Madam Weng asked him with a hint of playfulness.

"Yeah!" Shi Yulou responded. He began to feel bothered, and he seemed unwilling to listen anymore.

"Then I'll tell you, what I mean is: you won't leave me, because wherever you go, I will go with you! Even to the ends of the earth." Second Madam Weng enunciated each word one by one.

Shi Yulou felt even more oppressed. He regretfully wondered if he should have let Second Madam Weng say her true thoughts. He had been afraid that she would have such thoughts, so he had brought up the issue. The meaning of his bringing up the issue was to persuade Second Madam Weng to give up such thoughts, but now the effect was the opposite, seemingly strengthening Second Madam Weng's determination even more. Therefore, Shi Yulou was somewhat flustered! He pondered for a while, and finally said resolutely:

"You can't have this kind of thought. You have a home; you have a husband; you have children; you are a madam from an official's family, but I am just an actor."

Before Shi Yulou could finish speaking, Second Madam Weng interrupted and said:

"Please don't speak anymore! The home was built by me, and it should be me who dissolves it; the husband is as good as dead; the children, I can have them fostered out; all of this has nothing to leave behind, and nothing to worry about. You say you are an actor, I tell you I was a Qing opera singer; although later I became the concubine of an official, I am not any more noble than you. So, we are both wanderers on the road! Only when we are together can our hearts communicate."

Second Madam Weng had now become assertive and willful! This was partly due to the influence of Madam Mo, and partly brought out in front of Shi Yulou. Her words were strong and decisive, severely threatening Shi Yulou's fragile soul. At the same time, she was quite surprised that she was such an open-minded and responsible person.

"Why aren't you talking anymore?" Second Madam Weng anxiously pressed Shi Yulou. Hoping that Shi Yulou could give her an affirmative answer.

"I, I have nothing to say. My heart is very chaotic!"

Shi Yulou's heart was indeed very chaotic at this moment! He didn't know what to say, and he couldn't make up his mind about what to do. He could only remain silent. But his silence was mistaken by Second Madam Weng as an agreement! Therefore, she no longer delved deeper, and she was confident that she had already captured Shi Yulou. She began to plan for a future dream.
