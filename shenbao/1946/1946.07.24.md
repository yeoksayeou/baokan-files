The National Army launched a counterattack simultaneously from the Yangtai front this morning. The western route captured Baituo River and continued eastward, meeting the National Army advancing westward near Guangfu Bridge in the evening. Consequently, the Communist forces disrupting the Yangtai Highway have been completely driven away. According to reports, the Yangtai Highway was damaged by the Communist forces from midnight on the 13th of this month until the 18th, when the National Army repaired the road.

### When the National Army Recaptured Taixing, They Seized a Communist Secret Order; Conspiracy to Launch a Full-Scale Internal Rebellion is Clearly Revealed

[Central News Agency, Taixing, 23rd] When the National Army successively recaptured Taixing City and the towns occupied by the Communist forces on the 16th, they seized a Communist secret order, a directive to the entire 6th Division to seize Taixing. The document was issued on July 11th, signed and sealed by Tan Zhenlin, Wang Bicheng, Jiang Weiqing, Li Ganhui, and Zhang Chuangchu. The original text reads in brief: "Now the orders from the higher authorities have been issued, giving us the glorious mission of annihilating the enemy and taking Taixing City. We are about to enter the battle, and the gunfire is about to sound. This battle is of great significance to Central China and the entire country. We must achieve complete victory. This battle is the largest since the establishment of our division, and also for the 16th Brigade. We must fight to our heart's content and fight beautifully. In this battle, the 1st Division and the 7th Column, and other corps, will fight alongside us. We must coordinate with them to strive for victory in the entire campaign. At the same time, we must learn from them and compete with them in the revolution to see who can complete the combat mission 100%, who can correctly implement the confiscation policy and the prisoner-of-war policy, and who can capture the most prisoners and seize the most guns, cannons, and bullets. Comrades of the 16th Brigade, you must resolutely complete the mission, fight tenaciously, overcome all difficulties, and take Taixing. Comrades of the 16th Brigade, you have many experiences in counter-offensive battles, and you have established thousands of glorious achievements. You must carry forward your tradition of being brave and good at fighting, fight resolutely, complete the mission, annihilate the enemy, support the reinforcements, protect our brotherly units, take Taixing City, and strive for an even greater victory after the Yaojiadai battle. Comrades, our prestige has spread throughout the north and south of the Yangtze River. We are a magnificent division that has experienced hundreds of battles, is invincible in attack, and victorious in every battle. We are the people's army under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. Your bullets are loaded, your bayonets are sharpened, your cannons are aimed at the enemy, fight with unparalleled tenacity, and completely and thoroughly eliminate the enemy, annihilate the enemy's reinforcements, and take Taixing City. The glorious titles of combat hero, combat model, and work model await you." This document proves that the Communist forces are not only seizing Taixing and attacking North Jiangsu, but are also launching the beginning of a full-scale national rebellion. It is now reported that the National Army has sent a memorandum to the Nantong Group regarding the losses suffered in the attacked areas due to their trampling, lodging a solemn protest.

### The Executive Group Notifies Li Xiannian to Send Representatives to Discuss Ceasefire Measures; Intends to Make the Greatest Effort for Peaceful Mediation

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 23rd] After arriving in Laohekou on the 14th, the 9th and 32nd groups of the Military Mediation Department made the greatest effort possible to seek peace. As of the 21st, the two groups had sent four letters to Li Xiannian, hoping that he would send representatives or come in person to an agreed location to discuss peaceful ceasefire measures. Each letter stated that the government representatives would agree to a 24-hour ceasefire after the Communist representatives arrived in order to discuss peace issues and make contact with the group. All of the aforementioned letters were signed by representatives of all three parties and sent by plane to the Communist area. It was determined that the Communist forces had received them, but as of the 21st, there was still no response. Therefore, the fourth letter issued by the group on the 21st was worded even more earnestly, stating, "This is the last attempt for peace. If we are still unable to contact your commander's representatives by the 24th, the 9th and 32nd groups will go to Xi'an on the 25th and then to Beiping three days later to request instructions."

### Chairman in Lushan

— Our Correspondent in Kuling, Fang Canglang

Lushan, located in northern Jiangxi, encompasses seven major ridges and extends over five hundred li, is a renowned summer resort in Asia, China's summer capital, a cradle of the War of Resistance, and a cornerstone of national reconstruction. In terms of grandeur, its magnificence is beyond description; as for scenery, even a single rock or isolated peak is imbued with mist and clouds. The Ming Dynasty poet Wan Yi, in his poem about Lushan, wrote: "Auspicious clouds hover, thirty thousand feet high; excellent air descends, for two hundred years." Its atmosphere and scenery are such that they truly stir the heart and soul, inspiring a sense of transcendence. Therefore, our highest leader, Chairman Chiang, for several years before the War of Resistance, would take advantage of the summer vacation period each year to visit this mountain for a brief respite. As everyone knows, the summer climate of Lushan averages only seventy-five degrees. The climate is so cool and the scenery is exceptionally beautiful. For those who have lived in Nanjing for a long time, enduring the scorching sun and oppressive heat, ascending this mountain not only dispels the heat and eliminates worldly thoughts but also invigorates the spirit and enhances the interest in work due to the refreshing climate. Consequently, one cannot help but pursue work, strive in work, and become uplifted. Therefore, Chairman Chiang always seeks to encourage many young people to take advantage of the summer vacation to study in Lushan during the summer. After climbing the mountain, the Chairman not only enjoys robust health and a great appetite, but also, due to his abundant physical strength, his steps become more energetic. He often goes on unannounced excursions, alone with his cane and shoes, or strolls along the Flower Path, visiting the Immortal Ascension Platform of the White Deer Grotto; or explores the scenic cliffs, picnicking at the Imperial Stele Pavilion; or observes the waterfall at Stone Gate, gazing at the dense thickets, watching the raging waves and turbulent currents, flying up and falling down, and meditating deeply. Or he looks west towards Taiyi Peak, takes a car to Hanyukou, watches the sunset and moonrise, the dispersing clouds and vanishing mist, and nods with a smile. However, the Chairman's love for Lushan goes beyond this. People can perceive from the Chairman's words and actions that he deeply appreciates the dignified and pure atmosphere imbued by the spirit of Lushan. No one will forget that the grand strategy for China's War of Resistance was decided in Lushan nine years ago today. Everyone can imagine that the grand plan for China's national reconstruction may be decided today, tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, or in the near future, revisiting the lesson of nine years ago. Especially when General Marshall and Ambassador Stuart came to the mountain, people seemed to anticipate that after Ambassador Stuart presented his credentials, the situation might become clearer. Ambassador Stuart, still maintaining the demeanor of a scholar, also told reporters at 7:15 PM on the 19th, "The Chinese people are too miserable. Chairman Chiang is well aware of the suffering of the people and will issue a statement in the next two or three days. It is something that must be said and done. However, in the current situation, it may have to wait a few more days." However, our Chairman, who toils day and night, has his heart in the nation while residing in Lushan, never forgetting the suffering of the people. This great benevolence and magnanimity has moved both humans and gods and is truly inspiring. Specifically, at a time when the Chinese Communist Party is stirring up war in Jinan, Jinbei, western Henan, northern Hubei, Jiaodong, and northern Jiangsu, wantonly harming the people, the Chairman still hopes that the Communist Party will awaken with a great spirit of benevolence and still advocates resolving this troublesome issue of the Chinese Communist Party through political means. It is said that when the Chairman discussed this issue with General Marshall and Ambassador Stuart twice, expressing this compassionate attitude, both General Marshall and Ambassador Stuart were moved. After Ambassador Stuart took his leave, when speaking to others, he praised the Chairman's greatness and benevolence, hailing him as the "Savior of Mankind." Ambassador Stuart has been running schools in China for decades and has a deep understanding of Chinese history. He could see some signs of rise and fall in books about the Yellow Turban Rebellion of the Han Dynasty. When the White Wolf Rebellion of the early Republic occurred, he had already arrived in China. Now, this Ambassador Stuart, who deeply understands China's national conditions, has returned to Nanjing. General Marshall has also descended the mountain on the 22nd and flown back to Nanjing. Yesterday (the 21st), Chairman Chiang and his wife accompanied General and Mrs. Marshall on a tour of the Immortal Cave. After General Marshall returns to Beijing, the somber atmosphere of Nanjing may become more lively. However, the general view among the people in Lushan is twofold: Some say that if the CCP continues to insist on military separation and refuses to withdraw from northern Jiangsu and Jiaodong, this deadlock will not be broken. At that time, Ambassador Stuart will have to stay in Beijing to take care of his beloved Yenching University. It is also possible that General Marshall will have to return to Washington for a trip. Some say that if the CCP can awaken in a timely manner, change its basic attitude, abandon the delusion of force, and sincerely discuss all outstanding issues with the government, especially to stop the offensive in northern Jiangsu, negotiations can be reopened, and peace will not be hopeless. Now it seems to have reached a "final juncture." This is what the reporter heard on the mountain. In addition, Chairman Chiang's mountain life is also worth introducing: It is said that after climbing the mountain, the Chairman gets up no later than 6:30 AM every day, still washes his face with cold water, and after washing up, does more than ten minutes of exercise. After 7:00 AM, he reads the Bible. After 8:00 AM, he reads the morning newspaper (after the Lushan edition of the Central Daily News was published, there is a newspaper to read on the mountain every morning). After reading the newspaper, he sometimes reads important documents, and when he has time, he reads books, reading beneficial books. He usually eats breakfast before 10:00 AM. In the afternoon, he spends most of his time reading important reports, and when he has free time, he reads books, reading beneficial books.

### Judicial Offices Will Be Established in Counties Without Local Courts: Original Military Law Offices Abolished

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 23rd] Sun Honglin, President of the Suzhou High Court, met with this newspaper's Suzhou correspondent alone this morning and stated: The work of reinstatement of various levels of government in Suzhou Province has been completed, but judicial organs are not yet widespread. For example, Longshan, Wujiang, [illegible], Songjiang, and other places are [illegible], and the areas are narrow. Each county does not have a local court, and civil and criminal litigation cases are handled by the military law office separately established by the county government of each place, and the sentencing is often inappropriate. In addition to this promotion of the rule of law, there is a need for improvement, so that all people can be fully guaranteed by the law. Our court has already submitted an application to the Ministry of Judicial Administration to establish judicial offices in various counties without local courts. The county magistrate will concurrently serve as the prosecutor, and the chief judge will be appointed by our court to take over the position. The original military law office will be abolished.

Editorial

### Impartial Discussion on the Collection of Land Tax in Kind

Since the central government decided to continue collecting land tax in kind for another year, it is heard that local councils and people's organizations have expressed considerable opposition, requesting exemption from the collection in kind. Some believe that the government's policy of collecting in kind yields few benefits to the government while causing much disturbance to the people, which seems contrary to the government's original intention. Others believe that the government is not planning to stabilize the currency or suppress prices, yet it is unwilling to abandon the collection of land tax in kind, which will only lead to the further exhaustion of the national economy. All of the above may contain some truth and deserves the government's attention. Now, with the autumn harvest in sight, the land tax is about to be collected, and the central government has already made a decision to continue collecting in kind for another year. Considering the people's hardships and the government's painstaking efforts, we feel it is necessary to offer our opinion on this matter.

From a fundamental perspective, the collection of land tax, as practiced traditionally, differs greatly from modern tax concepts and is not entirely in line with the Three Principles of the People's land policy. Therefore, ultimately, the traditional land tax system should be abolished and replaced with a land tax that is consistent with our land policy. However, because land reorganization takes time, the collection of land tax has to be temporarily retained as an expedient measure during the transition period. This is the first point that must be recognized. Since it is an expedient measure, the government, during the war, had to secure physical goods to supply military and public grain, and thus made the decision to change the land tax to collection in kind. The implementation of this decision, though not without malpractices in execution and occasional harassment of the people, ensured the uninterrupted supply of military and public grain from the national perspective, making a significant contribution to the prosecution and victory of the protracted war. Now that victory has arrived, it may seem unnecessary to continue collecting in kind on the surface, but the reality is that the situation remains unstable, domestic transportation has not yet been fully restored, and the difficulties of the national economy have not eased. The government's decision to continue collecting land tax in kind for another year is a matter of necessity. We know that the government must take responsibility for national affairs, and any decision is made only after careful consideration. We should first understand the painstaking efforts behind the government's decision, and then work to reduce the malpractices that may arise from the collection in kind.

We should also point out that the decision to continue collecting land tax in kind for another year is a relatively wise decision from an economic perspective. The increased issuance of currency to cope with the war has already caused drastic fluctuations in prices and the general economic life. Our runaway inflation has not yet reached the frightening state of Hungary, but in the current situation, our runaway inflation has caused hardship for both the government and the people. The government's top priority now is to avoid further expanding the issuance of currency as much as possible, which would exacerbate the economic crisis. However, the current situation prevents the government from thoroughly reorganizing the currency. If the issuance of currency were to be expanded again without limitation at this juncture, the collapse of the national economy would be beyond salvation. Extending the collection of land tax in kind for another year implies that the government will not have to expand the issuance of currency due to the grain issue. If the government were to stop collecting land tax in kind, the supply of military and public grain would inevitably have to be purchased from the people with cash. To purchase military and public grain, several hundred billion legal tender would have to be added to the market. As a result, the people would directly suffer. Collecting land tax in kind can reduce the issuance of currency and further reduce speculation in the market. From an economic point of view, the collection of land tax in kind is still a necessary policy at this time.

Therefore, at this time, we should not simply oppose the continuation of collecting land tax in kind for another year in principle. But this does not mean that we must also continue to retain the various malpractices in execution that come with the collection of land tax in kind for another year. The complexity of the grain collection procedures and the unfair distribution of burdens should be adjusted and simplified. In addition, all kinds of malpractices during grain collection, such as inaccurate weighing, adding extra weight, kicking and slapping the measuring container, raising one side while lowering the other, scraping the container, mixing in poor quality grain, and demanding extra transportation fees, should be strictly prohibited and severely punished to appease public anger and reassure the people. As for the illegal corruption of officials and their abuse of power, the supervisory organization should be strengthened and rewards and punishments should be clearly defined. In some provinces, such as Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the land tax is particularly heavy. If adjustments are not made in time, reductions should be considered to ensure fairness. In short, the collection of land tax in kind is intended to benefit the national economy and should avoid disturbing the people as much as possible, so as not to betray the country's good intentions. Furthermore, in areas where disasters occur, the reporting procedures should be simplified. Once a disaster is reported, the province can first verify and approve reductions and exemptions so that the victims can receive practical benefits and their lives are not buried by bureaucratic rhetoric.

Regarding the decision to continue collecting land tax in kind for another year, Chairman Chiang has repeatedly stated this at the financial revenue and expenditure system meetings. Moreover, Chairman Chiang cares about the people's hardships and has repeatedly given instructions on preventing malpractices in the implementation of the collection in kind. We hope that the extension of the collection of land tax in kind can eliminate the accumulated malpractices of previous years. We especially hope that the local supervisory commissions will seriously supervise the collection of land tax so that it can be free of corruption. Then the people will surely increase their trust and love for the government. Only in this way can China embark on the road of national construction and move towards the goal of national revival.

### The Trend of Universal Suffrage in Turkey is Confirmed; The Republican People's Party Wins; The Soviet Union Takes the Opportunity to Criticize Turkey's Foreign Policy

[Reuter, London, 23rd] The election results in 57 of the 63 provinces in Turkey today show that the ruling Republican People's Party won 353 seats, the Democratic Party won 35 seats, and the Independent Party won 3 seats. Government candidates won all the seats in 38 provinces. In Kars and Ardahan, which the Soviets consider part of Greater Armenia, the government party received far more votes than other parties.

[Associated Press, Istanbul, 22nd] Democratic Party leader Mr. Bayar issued a statement today, accusing the government of manipulating yesterday's election by using "harsh repressive measures." The voting was relatively peaceful. However, the pre-election conflict once reached a climax. Four people were killed, and a large contingent of military police guarded the polling stations. The elected members will serve a four-year term and have the right to elect the cabinet, which will be selected from among the members. The new National Assembly is scheduled to meet on January 5th.

[Associated Press, London, 22nd] Moscow Radio broadcast a TASS dispatch from Istanbul, stating that the Turkish government authorities committed numerous illegal acts in yesterday's election. The election was not secret; no polling station had a private room, and voting was inconveniently conducted on the street, at entrances, doorways, parks, and parking lots. At the same time, the Moscow Workers' Daily also stated that complaints and reports of turmoil, threats, and bewilderment from voters were heard throughout Turkey. President Inönü's People's Party followed a pro-German policy during the war, which caused significant damage to Turkey. At the same time, Turkey has repeatedly shown an unfriendly attitude towards the Soviet Union.

### Bombing Incident in Jerusalem; British Government Attaches Great Importance; The Number of Casualties Has Now Increased to Ninety; Jewish Immigration Case is Severely Affected

[Our Report] London, 23rd Broadcast: Regarding the bombing of the British military headquarters in Jerusalem, British Prime Minister Attlee stated in the House of Commons today that such actions are tantamount to murder and irrational acts of terrorism, and said that Britain will not retreat because of such actions. Eden asked if the British government was prepared to take immediate action, and Attlee replied, "Without a doubt." According to the latest reports, the number of deaths and injuries from yesterday's bombing has reached 45 each.

[French News Agency, Jerusalem, 23rd] The unprecedented bombing of the British military headquarters in the King David Hotel here yesterday has shocked the Palestinian Jews and aroused unanimous indignation. The bombing was the largest sabotage operation in Palestine. So far, 60 soldiers and civilians have been confirmed dead, including several senior British government officials. The Jews are stunned by this tragedy. They fear that this crime will arouse the indignation of the world, even among sympathizers of Judaism. According to the investigation, the terrorists disguised themselves as laborers and infiltrated the ground floor of the hotel. There were five of them in total, all dressed in Arab clothes, carrying milk cans containing explosives. After taking control of the hotel staff, they put the bombs in the freight elevator. The group then went to the British military nightclub connected to the hotel, where they were stopped by a British officer, whom they immediately injured. The terrorists arrived at the nightclub, expelled all the staff, and then placed another bomb. After completing their task, the terrorists fled the hotel, got into a car waiting 200 yards away, and drove off. Although the hotel sounded the alarm and the police arrived immediately, it was too late to arrest the perpetrators. One corner of the five-story King David Hotel was completely destroyed by the explosion. The hotel's facilities were among the best in the Middle East, and the interior of the hotel is now in a state of disarray.

### 200,000 Workers in Bombay Stage a General Strike for One Day; Fortunately, No Incidents Occurred

[Reuters, Bombay, 22nd] 200,000 workers in Bombay went on a 24-hour general strike today in sympathy with the postal and telecommunications workers' strike. Military police were on guard at key intersections all day, and no unfortunate incidents have been reported.

[Reuters, New Delhi, 22nd] A "New York Times" reporter noted that labor unrest in India is intensifying day by day. Bombay is almost isolated from the outside world in terms of transportation. Workers in other parts of the country are also dissatisfied. The current labor crisis in India is perhaps the most serious since the 1928 railway strike. Although it is too early to say that this uneasy situation has political significance, Indian leaders are now closely watching its development. Therefore, foreign observers believe that it is not difficult to derive its political symbolism. The Congress Party is powerless to do anything about it, and although the Communist Party is small, it is systematically encouraging labor unrest. In fact, very few of the striking workers truly understand Marxism. The Indian Communist Party is now free to do as it pleases because it is not constrained by the British-Indian negotiations and can incite millions of poorly paid Indian workers.

### Byrnes Urges the Publication of the Draft Treaty; Byrnes is Scheduled to Depart for Europe on Friday

[US Information Service, Washington, 22nd] US Secretary of State Byrnes recently sent a telegram to the foreign ministers of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, urging them to promptly publish the draft treaties with Italy, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, and Finland. A State Department spokesperson said that Undersecretary of State Dean Acheson had made this request several times, but the Soviet representative stated that this was a matter for the peace conference itself, not for any undersecretary or foreign minister. According to the State Department, Byrnes is scheduled to depart for Paris on the 27th to attend the peace conference.

[Associated Press, Paris, 22nd] Regarding the US proposal to publish the draft treaties of the five countries, France can agree, provided that Britain and the Soviet Union do the same.

[Associated Press, New York, 22nd] A dispatch from Paris: According to the recently drafted treaty, Italy, the Balkan countries, and Finland will be deprived of all means of waging war. This treaty will be discussed at the Paris Peace Conference.

### International Health Conference Establishes Agreement; China and India are Responsible for Convening the First Meeting

[French News Agency, New York, 22nd] The International Health Conference has established an agreement to maintain a world health organization, which has now been signed by 63 representatives, including four covering documents: (1) the final regulations of the Health Conference, (2) the organizational regulations, which must be submitted to the governments of the countries concerned for approval (only China and Britain have already approved), (3) the agreement on the temporary recommendations and the temporary committee established, and (4) the agreement on the establishment of the International Office of Public Health in Paris. In addition, representatives from China and India on the temporary committee are responsible for convening the first International Health Conference.

### US Authorities are Striving to Promote German Administrative and Economic Unity; Authorize the Commander of US Forces in Germany to Negotiate with Related Countries

[US Information Service, Washington, 22nd] The State Department today released Byrnes' instructions to General McNarney, commander of US forces in Germany, regarding the steps to be taken for economic unity in the US occupation zone of Germany. It stated that the US government firmly believes that the administration of Germany cannot continue to be divided into four unrelated zones without free economic exchange. According to the current situation, if this continues for a long time, it will inevitably cause economic paralysis in Germany. However, the US government is unwilling to allow this paralysis. Byrnes also proposed that economic unity should be implemented as soon as possible. He declared that the United States does not intend to partition Germany but intends to treat it as a single economic unit. He authorized McNarney to immediately negotiate with the occupying authorities of any zone or zones if the US proposal is not accepted by the representatives of the countries concerned, so as to implement the treatment of each occupying zone as an economic unit. The instructions praised that any agreement made with any government could be joined by other related countries at any time. McNarney was also authorized to cooperate with the three occupying governments to establish appropriate administrative agreements, the scope of which includes finance, transportation, communications, industry, and foreign trade. Regarding the French occupation zone, Byrnes authorized McNarney to negotiate with the French representatives, but the Saar region is not included in any economic unity agreement.

### Two US Military Officers Disappear in the Soviet Occupation Zone of Germany; Believed to be Due to Robbery

[Our Report] San Francisco, 23rd Broadcast: Two US military officers stationed in the US occupation forces in Germany disappeared in the Soviet occupation zone. According to a French officer familiar with the two US military officers, Soviet soldiers were secretly selling diamonds not long ago. The US military officer intended to buy diamonds as a gift for his wife, who was about to arrive in Berlin from the United States. It is believed that the disappearance of the two men may be due to robbery.

### Revolutionary New Government Established in Bolivia; US Recognition Still Pending

[Associated Press, Washington, 22nd] A revolution occurred in Bolivia, and the government of former President Villarroel was overthrown and replaced by a revolutionary government. Diplomatic circles here expect that the United States will take a more friendly attitude towards the new government. According to State Department officials, the situation in La Paz is still chaotic, but the relationship between the United States and the former Bolivian government has always been cold and distant. That government came to power through a violent coup in 1943, and the United States did not recognize it for several months.

[French News Agency, Washington, 22nd] A State Department spokesperson stated that the United States' recognition of the new government of Bolivia is based on two principles: (1) the new government should first prove that it can maintain law and order and respect the law, and (2) the new government must guarantee compliance with the international agreements concluded by the previous government.

[French News Agency, Rio de Janeiro, 22nd] According to news from the capital of Bolivia, the revolutionary movement in that country is led by the Colorado Party. However, labor unrest in La Paz is still ongoing. Colonel Espenhart, the former Bolivian military attaché to Brazil, has reportedly been appointed as foreign minister.

### Britain is Expanding Fortifications in Singapore; To Make it a Military Base in the Far East; Using 20,000 Japanese Prisoners of War to Build Barracks

[Reuters, Singapore, 23rd] The war and the changes in the Indian political situation have made Singapore a military base instead of a defensive base. When the Japanese attacked Singapore in December 1941, Malaya had no defensive works. The British army had no tanks and no flat-trajectory guns, and the Royal Air Force was incomplete. It is expected that this situation will not be seen again in the future. Singapore will become the military center and base for the entire Southeast Asia in the future, not just for the navy. According to Major General Cox, commander of the Singapore Defense Force, when Britain's main base in East Asia was located in India, Singapore had only a small amount of ammunition. In the future, it will be greatly increased. In the event of war, it can be used for long-term resistance. Singapore is the gateway to the Far East and Australia and must be made a base in the Far East. For a considerable period of time, Singapore should maintain a considerable number of troops. 20,000 Japanese prisoners of war are being ordered to build barracks for the British army. Currently, there are 45,000 troops stationed in Singapore.

Worker Strike

[Reuters, Singapore, 22nd] 15,000 workers at the Singapore naval base have gone on strike because wage increase negotiations have broken down. Because the workers do not have responsible leaders, it is difficult to conduct negotiations.

### China Requests the Return of Small Islands Near Taiwan; Dispute with the Philippines Occurs

[Associated Press, Manila, 23rd] Philippine Foreign Minister Quirino stated today that the Philippine government is preparing a note requesting the abolition of the 1930 treaty that gave Britain administrative jurisdiction over the Turtle Islands (outside North Borneo). This treaty was signed by the United States and Britain, and the Philippine government will inquire with the United States about the treaty relationship. It also stated that China has a dispute with the Philippines over the ownership of the small islands of Sirengeito, which are located 200 miles west of Palawan Island. The Philippines intends to incorporate them into its national defense scope. The Sirengeito islands were jointly occupied by France and Japan before the war. After China recovered sovereignty over Taiwan this time, it requested their return on the grounds that the small islands previously belonged to the administrative region of Taiwan.

### World Trade Preparatory Committee to be Held in England in October

[US News, Washington, 22nd] The preparatory meeting for the World Trade and Employment Conference will be held in London on October 15.

The first meeting will discuss general world trade, the second will discuss reducing trade barriers, and the third will be a broad conference. The United States has drafted a proposed outline and distributed it to various countries for research.

### Doihara's Crimes are Obvious; Qin Dechun Testifies Again Yesterday

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd Special Dispatch] General Qin Dechun, Deputy Minister of National Defense of China, testified for the second time at the International Tribunal this morning and refuted the defense presented by Doihara's defense lawyer, Naoki Shikiyo, stating: "The 'Lawrence of Manchuria,' Doihara, always gave General Song Zheyuan and Chu Minyi a headache. Doihara exerted considerable pressure in North China. Although Song and Chu agreed to the establishment of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council in order to maintain peace in North China, they never supported the 'autonomy movement' in North China." At this point, Shikiyo produced a Chinese painting and claimed that the painting was given to Doihara by General Song Zheyuan in "gratitude for his cooperation." When the painting was opened in front of Qin, Qin smiled and immediately replied: "This painting was given when Doihara left China. It is very common in our country for officials to exchange gifts, so it cannot be used as evidence favorable to the defendant." Shikiyo then tried to explain that the night military exercises conducted by the Japanese army in Chinese territory nine years ago were legal, claiming that the Boxer Protocol granted Japan the privilege of conducting military exercises in Chinese territory. Qin immediately retorted: "Then China should have been notified in advance, and the local authorities should have informed the local residents." At this point, Shikiyo tried to explain that the Japanese army's invasion of China was reasonable. He pointed out the Tongzhou incident on July 29 and the second shooting incident in Beiping on July 26. Regarding this point, Qin retorted that the shooting began on the morning of July 8, 1937, and stopped after the Tongzhou and Beiping shooting incidents occurred, until the end of the war last year. He said that his statement that Doihara was the instigator of the Mukden Incident was based on Chinese intelligence and reports from various other parties. Today, when the defense lawyer of the defendant Iwane Matsui listened to General Qin Dechun's testimony in court, he pointed out that Song Zheyuan, Han Fuqu, and Qin had all participated in the Greater East Asia Conference. Qin replied: "I know that one person participated. This person is Qi Xieyuan, who was being tried in our country for treason."

### Atomic Bomb Re-test Nears: Target Ships Positioned, Ships Will Be Sucked to the Bottom During Explosion

[United Press, USS Appalaichian, 22nd] Aboard the reporter ship USS Appalaichian, today we sailed into Bikini Lagoon to observe the positioning of the target ships for the first underwater atomic bomb test. The arrangement of these ships has been completely changed. The battleship Nevada, which was the target in the July 1st test, is no longer at the center. It has been replaced by the battleship Arkansas and the aircraft carrier Saratoga. To the west are six submarines, some submerged and some on the surface. Within them are six transport ships. The battleship New York is stationed on the inner line, east of the barge holding the atomic bomb. To the north of the "dead circle" is the Arkansas, flanked by a submarine, a landing craft, and a cargo ship. Behind it is the Japanese battleship Nagato. To the north of the Nagato is the Nevada, and beyond that is a row of landing craft. The German cruiser Prinz Eugen is positioned on the advantageous outer line of the targets. On the west side of the inner line are the cruiser Pensacola and the aircraft carrier Independence, both of which were heavily damaged in the first test and are now placed in a dangerous position again. Several transport ships are arranged on the southwestern edge. Multiple light ships are scattered throughout the entire target fleet, along with a floating dock and a steel-framed barge.

[United Press, Bikini, 23rd] The underwater atomic bomb explosion test, scheduled for dawn on the 25th, may be delayed due to tropical weather developing over the Marshall Islands. General Blandy personally supervised the submersion of the submarine Apogon today. A total of six submarines will submerge, while the other two will remain on the surface in the target area.

[United Press, Reporter Ship USS Appalaichian, 22nd] The director of the atomic bomb test's scientific and technical department, Sou Yi, predicted that new phenomena will occur in naval warfare. Ships will first be sucked to the bottom and then thrown out of the water at crazy angles. When the fifth atomic bomb explodes underwater, it appears that one million to ten million tons of seawater will be thrown into the air, creating a water column 1,000 feet in diameter and 10 feet high. A large hole, 100 feet deep, will open on the surface. Nearby ships will be sucked into this hole.

### East Indies Should Be Renamed the United States of Indonesia: Van Mook's Proposal

[Agence France-Presse, Batavia, 22nd] Representatives from various parts of the East Indies recently held a conference in Marino City. The Dutch East Indies Deputy Governor, Van Mook, proposed to the assembly that Indonesia should be called the "United States of Indonesia" in the future and that the country should be divided into four states: (1) Java, (2) Sumatra, (3) Borneo, and (4) "Greater East," including Sulawesi Island and its nearby islands. It is reported that the majority of representatives expressed agreement with this proposal.

### International Tidbits

The US President recommends Under Secretary of State Dunn as Ambassador to Italy.

The United States spent a total of 967 billion yuan during the six years of strengthening national defense and combat.

(Diagram showing the target area and the routes and positions of the testing equipment during the first atomic bomb test on July 1st. The second test will be held tomorrow at the same location – Bikini Lagoon.)

### Gold Brick Case Trial Opens: Six Defendants Simultaneously File Motions, Chen Yuansheng Confesses in Court, Stole Out of Speculative Failure, Suffered Nervous Stimulus in Waiting Room, Cried and Laughed Uncontrollably

[Reported by this newspaper] The chief culprit in the Central Bank gold brick theft case, Chen Yuansheng, was put on trial by Judge Zhong Xianda in the Second Criminal Court of the District Court yesterday afternoon. At 8:30 a.m. yesterday, when Chen was escorted from the Sinan Road Detention Center to the Northern Zhejiang Road District Court by several bailiffs, he suddenly suffered a nervous breakdown in the court's waiting room, crying and laughing uncontrollably, speaking incoherently. At 2:30 p.m., when he was brought to the courtroom, he returned to normal. Chen Yuansheng hired lawyer Sun Lishi for his defense. The other defendants, Wu Minggang, Wang Shumei, Chen Youqing, Shi Xianglong, and Yu Shiyang, also hired lawyers for their defense. At exactly 2:30 p.m., the trial began. Chen Yuansheng stated: 30 years old, from Zhejiang. He joined the Central Bank in 1933 and was a staff member of the Custody Department before the crime. At that time, his base salary was 60 yuan, and according to the cost of living index, his monthly income was about 140,000 to 150,000 yuan. He has an elderly mother and older siblings, with whom he does not live separately. The gold bricks, etc., were entrusted to him by the Custody Department Director for safekeeping. Because the salary he earned could not support his family, he engaged in speculation. He first stole stocks and US dollars. Because he had losses, he stole gold bricks and public bonds to try to make up for them. The gold bricks were initially pawned to Pan Jialiu, a former Central Bank colleague who is now the Assistant Manager of the Shanghai City Bank, at an interest rate of 16%. Because they were not redeemed after the expiration date, they were sold by the other party. The Class C public bonds were given to Yu Shiyang, whom he met during transactions. Chen also stated that the gold bricks had the English words "Central Bank of Manchuria" on them. When he went to Hangzhou, he carried three taels of gold bars, 4,000 American Asia stocks, and 300,000 yuan in cash.

Wu Minggang stated: 33 years old, from Sichuan, Assistant Manager of the Shanghai Chongqing Bank. The gold bricks were introduced by Pan Jialiu. Because he trusted Pan, he did not look closely. The gold bricks were brought by Yang Dehui, Deputy Section Chief of the Business Department of the Shanghai City Bank. Because the Bankers' Association had issued a notice that gold bricks could be used as collateral, he accepted them. The interest rate was 13.5%.

Wang Shumei stated: 34 years old, from Ningbo, engaged in the stock business. He was introduced by Pan Jialiu to use his name to pawn the gold bricks. Because he trusted Pan, he did not ask about the source of the gold bricks. He earned an interest of 2.5%. He did not know about the rest of the sale.

Chen Youqing stated: 26 years old, from Zhenjiang, Deputy Manager of the Santai Silver Shop on Sichuan Road. He purchased the gold bricks from Yang Dehui, Deputy Section Chief of the Business Department of the Shanghai City Bank, on May 4th at a price of 1,615,000 yuan per bar. Because he trusted Yang Dehui, he did not investigate the source of the gold bricks. These gold bricks were later melted into small pieces by the Xianghe Silver Shop and sold.

Shi Xianglong stated: 35 years old, from Yuyao, working at the Xianghe Silver Shop. He had dealings with Chen Youqing, so he knew him. He personally received the gold bricks on May 4th. He opened them and looked at them, but he did not understand English. The melting fee was 4 qian 5 fen 3 li of gold.

Yu Shiyang stated: Engaged in the money shop business. He initially did not know that Chen Yuansheng was a staff member of the Central Bank. Chen said on May 22nd that he wanted to sell the public bonds he had deposited, but they were not sold. Chen Yuansheng also stated: The public bonds were divided into four packages, with the Central Bank's seal on them. He only speculated for two or three months. The public bonds were never sold. He first used US dollars, and later pawned gold bricks to make up for the US dollars. At this point, Pan Jialiu, Assistant Manager of the City Bank, was summoned to the court. He stated: From Wuxian, he and Chen Yuansheng were trainees at the Central Bank in 1935, so they knew each other. Because Chen insisted on asking for help in finding funds, he introduced him to pawn the gold bricks.

### Central Bank Files Incidental Private Lawsuit Demanding Compensation for Gold Bricks

At that time, Shu Zhiguan, Deputy Director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, represented by lawyer Zuo De, stood up and filed an incidental civil lawsuit, demanding that the five defendants jointly compensate for 453 taels 2 qian 3 fen of gold bricks, and that Chen Yuansheng alone compensate for 5,358,492 yuan 8 jiao 1 fen. Because the public bonds have been returned, compensation is not sought. At this point, Judge Zhong announced that the trial would be adjourned for another hearing.

[Another report] According to defendant's lawyer Sun Lishi, Chen Yuansheng was a temporary employee of the Custody Department of the Central Bank's Business Bureau, without a letter of appointment, so he cannot be prosecuted as a civil servant. Moreover, Chen committed the crime due to speculative failure, which was caused by the social environment.

### Refugee Youths from Northern Jiangsu Send Letter to Zhou Enlai

### Zhu Xuefan Talks About Impressions of Moscow: Large Population, Tense Work, High Heels and Permed Hair: Soviet Women are No Exception

[Reported by this newspaper] The "World Federation of Trade Unions," an organization of 70 million workers from 55 countries around the world, held its first Executive Committee meeting in Moscow in mid-June of this year. The Chinese delegation was attended by Zhu Xuefan, Chairman of the Chinese Labor Association. The conference agenda consisted of five major points. After the closing ceremony, the Soviet Trade Union Federation hosted all 27 delegates, touring Leningrad. On the 9th of this month, Zhu returned to Shanghai via Vladivostok, arriving safely in Shanghai on the 21st by ship.

Yesterday afternoon, Zhu Xuefan spoke to reporters from this newspaper about his impressions of Leningrad and Moscow. Leningrad, a metropolis with a population of over 3 million, is a port of entry and exit for millions of tons of goods. Coal and machinery from England and cotton from the United States are imported here in exchange for timber. The tragic destruction of the war has now been restored to its usual state. Over 90% of the buildings have been repaired, with only the area near the sea still under reconstruction. Many soldiers have returned home after demobilization, so it seems unprecedentedly crowded. The most pressing issue at present is still housing.

Regarding the general situation in the Soviet Union at present, Zhu said: "An average worker can earn about 250 rubles per month (the official price is 5.30 rubles per US dollar), while skilled workers can earn 2,000 to 3,000 or more. The highest-paid academicians of the Academy of Sciences earn almost over 30,000. All prices are controlled, and the quantity purchased is limited. Unless you have extra money, you can buy some items in addition to rations at prices ten or eight times higher than the official price from stores. Production focuses on heavy industry and the manufacture of necessities. Luxury goods are rarely found among imported goods. The mandarin oranges that can be bought everywhere in Shanghai are not available in the Soviet Union. Even the ships traveling between Shanghai and Vladivostok bring enough of their domestically produced food and never purchase them abroad." However, there are also women wearing high heels and permed hair on Moscow's main streets. They also love to dress up, but there are fewer of them compared to the general world metropolis. The majority of working women's clothing is still as simple as it was during the war. There are two large hotels in Moscow that also have dance floors. Entertainment includes opera and ballet. Hollywood movies also have a large audience there. Zhu has two impressions of Moscow: a large population (with a population of 6.1 million) and tense work. The fourth five-year plan has now begun.

At this time, the reporter asked the last question: "Is the Soviet Union still as strictly controlling the news as before?" I received an affirmative answer. He said: "Yes, they still control the news. Often, after we finished the conference in Moscow, we hosted reporters from various countries. At that time, a British reporter asked whether the Executive Committee would check. The representative of the Soviet Trade Union Federation replied: If the dispatch is entirely factual, it will be passed, otherwise it will be withheld. It can be seen that the Soviet Union still checks news telegrams." As for what is fact and what is not, it will probably be based on the subjective opinion of the checker.

### Guangxi Fellow Villagers in Shanghai Discuss Disaster Relief

### Financial Vice Minister Xu Boyuan Issues Statement; The Question of Whether to Abolish the Joint Treasury; Banks Can Decide on Loans Under 50 Million

Recently, Shanghai newspapers have reported that the mission of the Joint Treasury has been completed and should be dissolved. According to Xu Boyuan, Political Vice Minister of Finance and Secretary-General of the Joint Treasury, he cannot express any opinion on the question of whether to abolish it. Regarding its establishment and main tasks, he stated that the Joint Treasury was established in Shanghai after the outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai War. Its main task was to unite the strength of the four banks to stabilize finance and support the long-term war of resistance. Therefore, after its establishment, it set up branches and joint lending committees in major commercial ports. When the government moved west, the head offices of the banks were established in Chongqing and Hong Kong. To ensure that the banks acted in unison and effectively assisted the government in implementing national policies, the central government promulgated the Outline of Measures for Consolidating Finance in the autumn of the 28th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1939], increasing the authority and strengthening the organization of the Joint Treasury. The operations of the China Trust and Postal Remittances Bureaus were also subsequently placed under the supervision of the Joint Treasury. The highest leader and chairman of the board of directors were appointed by the heads of the ministries of finance, economy, transportation, and food, as well as the presidents, vice presidents, and general managers of the four banks, respectively. The Joint Treasury handled important tasks such as lending for production enterprises, expanding agricultural loans, promoting various types of reserves, coordinating the allocation of military and government remittances, centralizing the issuance of banknotes, standardizing the accounting of various banks, implementing the division of business between banks and bureaus, supervising banks and bureaus in handling post-war recovery, and laying out the national financial network. The decisions on various policies and guidelines of the Joint Treasury, as well as the handling of various loan cases, were first submitted to various small groups, with the participation of the heads of relevant departments and relevant leaders from each bank to provide opinions. The nature of the Joint Treasury is essentially a coalition of various banks and bureaus. Its mission is to coordinate and collaborate the business of various banks and bureaus, to communicate the national financial guidelines and the government's economic policies to ensure close cooperation, and to continuously plan and promote various financial and economic implementations in many ways. I dare say that since the establishment of the Joint Treasury, the four banks and two bureaus have worked together to make a considerable contribution to the collective efforts of the country. It has not been long since the return of the capital, and some people may not fully understand the situation of the Joint Treasury. Regarding the handling of various loans, outsiders believe that the procedures are slow, difficult to approve, and the approved amount often fails to meet the needs. He said that such criticism was already heard in Chongqing. The Treasury has always handled loan approvals fairly, in accordance with established principles, and the loan amount is determined based on the actual needs of the manufacturer. As long as the application forms are complete and the other conditions are met, they are handled quickly. Recently, it has been decided that loans under 50 million will be approved directly by each bank or bureau, further simplifying the procedures. However, the financial resources of the banks and bureaus are not unlimited, and loans to industrial and commercial enterprises, under the national financial and economic policy, must also be subject to certain standards.

### Chinese Stocks Initially Firm, Then Weak

Foreign stocks also declined across the board.

Chinese stocks fluctuated erratically, with active trading. Except for Wing On, which managed to maintain support, the rest lacked momentum. The prospect of Mayer & Co. issuing stock dividends was uncertain, causing significant declines. The market initially showed firmness but later weakened. Major bullish investors still exited the market, suggesting a temporary pause. The highest prices were seen for Wing On Textile at 713 yuan, Mayer & Co. at 4950 yuan, Jingfu at 285 yuan, Xinguang at 280 yuan, and Qinxing at 205 yuan. All experienced declines by noon. Generally, Mayer & Co. and Qinxing traded at lower prices, while Wing On Textile, Jingfu, and Xinguang were higher than their morning opening prices. Less popular small and medium-sized stocks, as well as veteran stocks, showed renewed signs of weakness, resulting in Wing On Textile rising slightly compared to the previous close, while Mayer & Co., Jingfu, and Xinguang fell slightly. Qinxing fell by half a percent, while the less popular small and medium-sized stocks each fell by about half a percent. Veteran stocks were also affected.

Foreign stocks initially showed stability in the morning but ultimately lacked support. As Chinese stocks declined, securities dealers continued to liquidate their positions. Ewo Silk Mills retreated from 9900 to 9200 before stabilizing somewhat. British American Tobacco, after opening at 9800, also proved unsustainable. The rest fared even worse, with more selling than buying. As a result, compared to the previous close, Ewo Silk Mills and British American Tobacco declined slightly, while Ewo Brewery, Jardine Matheson, Taikoo Dockyard, Yee Tsoong Paper, and Asia declined by about half a percent each.

### Gold Prices Rise with US Dollars

Gold bullion was boosted by the rise in US dollars yesterday. It opened at 1.958 million in the morning, and buyers emerged slightly, pushing the price up to around 1.98 million. The Central Bank distributed 43 bars at a price of 1.97 million. After 10:00 AM, prices declined slightly. Although the US dollar showed several surges, general sentiment, influenced by the Mexican bank's gold selling price of just over 40 yuan, which was much lower than in Shanghai, did not stimulate the market. Instead, the gold market weakened slightly, trading around 1.965 million at noon. The market stabilized slightly in the afternoon, resulting in a gain of 13,000 compared to the previous close. Gold ornaments rose to 1.01 million, while silver bullion and silver dollars remained unchanged. The black market interest rate remained around 13%.

Foreign currencies generally benefited from the Central Bank's announcement that cash could be used for foreign exchange settlement, leading to active buying. It opened at 2530 yuan in the morning, with demand exceeding supply. After some fluctuations, the price rose to 2640 yuan. As some physical currency flowed out, the price fell back to around 2580 yuan at noon. The market recovered slightly in the afternoon, resulting in a gain of 75 yuan compared to the previous close. Hong Kong dollars were initially firm but later leveled off, rising to over 570 yuan, resulting in a gain of 8 yuan compared to the previous close. The Hong Kong exchange rate was around 560 yuan, the Indian exchange rate was around 680 yuan, and the British exchange rate was around 9000 yuan. The US exchange rate remained inactive.

### Brisk Tea Sales

Domestic sales of black and green tea are improving, with buying interest from various quarters increasing daily. O.P. "Made in Taiwan" black tea, Chen Ding Qimen tea, and Yuan Yuan Chen stir-fried green tea are in high demand, with supply failing to meet demand, pushing up prices. As for the foreign trade tea market, various tea merchants are still interested in Yuan Yuan Chen special grade tea, but the trend seems to be stabilizing. If the price of Wenzhou Xin Zhen Mei tea is right, exporters are also interested in purchasing it.

### Spun Yarn Continues to Rise; Active Spot Cotton Trading

The yarn market was quiet yesterday, with weak demand, but underlying support remained firm. The output of Suzhou yarn was also considerably reduced. Demand for 20-count spun yarn from fabric factories remained strong, and prices continued to rise by 30,000 to 40,000. The fortunes of other 20-count yarns varied. Due to the limited supply of 42-count and 32-count fine yarns, prices rose by around 20,000.

Yesterday, the New York cotton market showed mediocre conditions, with fluctuations of 3-5 points. The near-term price was 35.77 USD, the forward price was 35.81 USD, and the middling price was 36.47 USD. Spot cotton trading in Shanghai was peaceful. Private yarn factories such as Xinsheng, Shenxin, and Jiafeng were more active in purchasing. Transactions involving different grades remained active, and prices remained stable with a slight upward trend.

### Rice Prices Continue to Fall

Yesterday, 8795 shi of rice arrived in the North and South Rice Markets, but sales remained sluggish. Prices continued to fall by 1000-2000 yuan, with lower grades declining by another 2000-3000 yuan. Wheat from Shantou was slightly higher, and the market was stable. Ningbo prices were firm but not strong, with tight purchase prices. Closing prices were weak. Flour declined slightly by 100-200 yuan. Oil prices jumped sharply by 4000-5000 yuan due to supply falling short of demand. Soybean oil remained stable. Soybean cake sales were sluggish. Soybeans, driven by slight activity in Shantou and Ningbo, turned from weak to firm, rising by 600-700 yuan. Raw peanuts were selling well, causing prices to soar by 4000-5000 yuan.

### China Trust Intends to Purchase Qihong Tea

Existing stock approximately 15,000 boxes; total could reach 280,000 boxes

Tea merchants plan to send representatives to Beijing to request an extension of loan repayment and a new loan of 10 billion yuan to facilitate the transformation of spring tea, including packaging, transportation, and the continued purchase of tea, as well as autumn harvest expenses. It has been heard that the China Trust Bureau is considering purchasing Qihong tea to barter with the Soviet Union. A decision has been made to first discuss countermeasures with the China Trust Bureau. The tea merchants' export guild is calling a meeting at 3:00 PM this afternoon, with an important proposal to telegraph all members to ship the finished black tea, costing 270,000 yuan and totaling 15,000 boxes, along with all 200+ samples, from various places to Shanghai for public evaluation before submitting them to the China Trust Bureau. According to tea industry insiders, in addition to the 15,000 boxes of Qimen tea already produced, the potential output could reach around 280,000 boxes. The output of Tunxi Pingshui (Shaoxing) green tea is four to five times higher than that of Qimen.

### Adjusted Electricity Usage Results in Sharp Reduction in China Textile Production

Employee subsidies paid at 70%

[Report from this newspaper] According to sources at the China Textile Construction Company, since the Shanghai Electric Power Company began adjusting electricity usage at the end of May, the total output of the company's factories has been reduced by one-third compared to its peak period. Currently, over 400,000 spindles and over 8,000 looms are in operation daily, with a daily output of approximately 700 bales of cotton yarn and approximately 17,000 pieces of cotton cloth.

It is also reported that the company's employee compensation has been reduced across the board since July, in accordance with the instructions of Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Yunwu. It is heard that the reduction is being implemented by paying employees' subsidies at 70%. This reduction in compensation applies equally to technical and administrative personnel, with no discrimination. The base salary of technical personnel at the company has always been higher than that of administrative personnel. After the implementation of this reduction in compensation, an employee with a base salary of 100 yuan can receive approximately 300,000 yuan per month, in addition to free meals and accommodation provided by the company.

Slack Bond Market

Except for Class A and B bonds, which were slightly absorbed by a major player on the fifth floor and remained relatively stable, the rest showed no significant activity, with limited fluctuations and a sluggish market. Class C bonds traded at a low of 800 yuan and a high of 850 yuan, resulting in a decline of 50 yuan compared to the previous close. Class A and B remained unchanged, Class D declined by 50 yuan, and Class E declined by 30 yuan.

Slightly Weak Brown Sugar

The sugar market trend turned flat yesterday, due to a certain firm's intention to sell off a large number of goods, resulting in more favorable prices. However, no transactions were completed. Chaozhou's first-grade refined sugar was still quoted at 94,000-95,000 yuan, with 40-50 bags of Chong Ti refined sugar opening at 91,000-90,000 yuan.

### American Chamber of Commerce Application Approved by the Bureau of Social Affairs

[Report from this newspaper] This reporter recently learned from responsible persons at the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai that the chamber has applied for registration with the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs and has been approved. Currently, a total of 78 American businesses in Shanghai have joined the chamber as members. It is understood that a considerable number of American businesses operating in Shanghai have not joined the chamber, but the exact number is unknown. In 1941, the American Chamber of Commerce had 177 members. It is estimated that at that time, the total number of American businesses operating in Shanghai was over 200.

### Bumper Harvest in Southeastern Provinces

After the Ministry of Food recently announced that food prices were falling in various places and a bumper harvest could be expected, the ministry received reports from Jiangxi, Guangdong, Fujian, and Hunan provinces stating that the autumn harvest has begun in various places and the harvest is very abundant. However, specific figures will need to await the completion of the harvest before they can be statistically determined.

### British Exchange Rate Fluctuates with the Market; Positions Adjusted Regularly; The Truth Behind Foreign Exchange Settlement in the Sterling Area

[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday, newspapers reported that the Central Bank has stipulated that, effective immediately, purchases from the Sterling Area must be settled in pounds sterling, and purchases from the US Dollar Area must be settled in US dollars. According to responsible parties at the Central Bank, this regulation has been in effect for some time. Although the Central Bank has not announced the telegraphic transfer rate for the pound sterling, import and export businesses with normal needs can obtain British exchange rates from designated banks. The Central Bank is responsible for adjusting the supply and demand of British exchange rates in the market. The price of the pound sterling is purely determined by market fluctuations.

### Bureau of Social Affairs Formulates Sugar Rationing Measures

Registration begins immediately and ends on the 26th

The Bureau of Social Affairs has formulated sugar rationing measures with the Taiwan Sugar Corporation to suppress sugar prices. It has been decided that these measures will be implemented starting with the seventh batch of 15,000 bags of Taiwan sugar. All businesses operating in Shanghai that deal in North-South goods, tea, food, or also retail sugar; sugar, cookie, and cracker factories; Hua-fang doctors; groups; and consumer cooperatives that require sugar may declare the quantity they need and submit it to the Bureau of Social Affairs for verification and transmission to the Taiwan Sugar Corporation for rationing. The sugar rationed is limited to 20th-grade medium-grain white sugar, with the price temporarily set at 75,000 yuan per dan. In addition to the 1% commission given by the Taiwan Sugar Corporation, each distributor is allowed to add a legal profit. The price for selling in the original bag is set at 81,000 yuan per dan, and the price for selling in opened packages is 860 yuan per jin. In the future, rationing will be carried out once a week, with the quantity determined by need and the price not exceeding the aforementioned limits. Registration for the seventh batch begins immediately and ends on the 26th. Distributors must not raise prices, mix in impurities, deduct quantity, or conceal and refuse to sell. In addition to having the relevant trade associations provide a written guarantee, the Bureau of Social Affairs will send personnel to investigate at any time. All stores must display their distribution certificates and retail prices in conspicuous locations in front of the store. Citizens who purchase sugar from retailers must be limited to the quantity they actually need. If the quantity is excessive, they should submit a certificate for verification. If anyone is found hoarding sugar for resale for profit, they will be severely punished.

### Prices Soar in the United States; Up 25% in Two Weeks

[Washington, DC, United States Information Service, 22nd] The White House announced today a statement from the Department of Commerce stating that agricultural products and imports should bear the greatest responsibility for stimulating inflation after the Price Control Authority was abolished on June 30. According to an economic survey report submitted by the Department of Commerce to President Truman, the daily market index of the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that prices for 28 major commodities rose by 25% in the first 16 days of July. Although the elimination of subsidies was one reason for rising prices, the rate of price increase was actually higher than the previous subsidies. This situation was especially true for livestock prices. Currently, the prices of grains, beef, butter, lead, and zinc are higher than after the end of World War I in 1919. The details of the recent overall price increase are not yet fully understood. Although there is a proposal to re-establish the Price Control Authority, the rising price trend has not been curbed. The report concludes: "Without the proposal to restore the Price Control Authority, the rising price trend may be even worse than it is today."

### A Visit to Jiangwan Airfield

— Zhu Minwei

Captain Mao Shangzhen drove a jeep. The vehicle was quite empty, carrying only this reporter as a passenger. His car bounced and jolted from his team headquarters onto the road to Jiangwan Airfield. After passing through the Sino-American military police checkpoint, the road revealed the rough and worn traces of day and night traffic. This very airfield, having received vital resources and brave warriors from the rear via the sky, is now, for those entering the bustling city, a place people naturally no longer think about, a desolate landing point.

Lieutenant Pilot

We followed a road marked with empty gasoline drums, and in an equally desolate command post, he introduced me to his operations officer, Zhu Peifeng. Zhu Peifeng is a lieutenant pilot in the air force. After graduating from the Sixteenth Class of the Air Force Officer School, he was assigned to the First Air Group as a trainee officer and pilot. Two years ago, his unique story had already attracted considerable attention. Before studying military aviation in the United States with other young men, he had already earned Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Engineering from Cambridge University in England.

When we met, he was planning flight routes at his desk, with an American officer waiting nearby. After finishing with the matter at hand, he stood up to talk to me. I sized him up. He was a man of medium height and broad build, older than his fellow flying students. As we talked, I learned that he was thirty-two years old.

A Daring Mission

To see the C-46 aircraft they were currently using, Mao Shangzhen switched to a medium-sized jeep. The slender Captain Mao was already suffering from a cold, but he willingly forced his body to obey his hospitality. The road from the command building to the aircraft parking area was equally bad. He drove quickly, then slowly, braking and starting on the rough road. Despite it being early summer, the wind in the open field carried sand and dust, blurring our vision. We spoke, but our words were quickly blown away by the wind and were difficult to hear.

In the car, Zhu Peifeng mentioned that he originally studied civil engineering in England and, after obtaining a Master's degree at Cambridge, went to the United States. In America, he saw the leading role of the aviation industry in society, so he entered the Pan American Airways (P.A.A.) Celestial Navigation School to study celestial navigation. His teacher was the same veteran celestial navigation expert who had taught Yi Fuen (I-Fu En) the year before. After completing this civilian aviation program, Zhu Peifeng saw that the world's wars were still unresolved, and many people were joining the air force to make their contributions. He simply decided to become a military aviator to fulfill his military duty. He obtained special permission from the air force authorities to enter the Sixteenth Class of the Air Force School for flight training in the United States. After graduating a year later, he immediately returned to China and was assigned to the First Air Group, serving as a B-29 bomber pilot. From bases in Liangshan, Sichuan; Zhijiang, Hunan; and Hanzhong and Ankang, Shaanxi, he attacked enemy positions in Henan, Hubei, Hunan, and Guangxi. During eight months of combat, he performed dangerous missions just like any other young man, without exception, despite being a trained engineer.

Two Hours of Flight

After the victory of the War of Resistance, he was sent to the United States to study in a special class at the U.S. Air Force Staff College. During the six-month period, in addition to practical skills, the academic subjects included thirty to forty books, equivalent to four years of study at a regular Chinese university, which had to be read and researched reports submitted within the deadline. Because he had already studied in England and the United States for many years, he was able to complete the assignments satisfactorily and on time.

When Zhu Peifeng was young, he lived a city life in Shanghai. Wanzhu Elementary School in the Nine Acres area of Nanshi was where he received his early education. His ancestral home was Fenghua, Zhejiang, but he rarely went there. Rural life, on the other hand, he experienced for a while while serving in the air force during the war.

Our car stopped in the C-46 parking area. Americans were constantly withdrawing from China, and these old C-46s were being gathered from various routes to this piece of land in Jiangwan. I took a look, and the area was about the size of the air transport base used at Xinjin, Sichuan, when B-29s bombed Kyushu, Japan. Captain Mao Shangzhen led me into the cockpit of the plane he was flying that day and explained the use of blind landing instruments and the piloting methods to me. His flight schedule for the day consisted of takeoffs and landings, a total of twelve times, amounting to two hours of flight. He would land, accelerate, take off, climb, and then land again. He planned to complete all the C-46 flight training within a week, without stopping even with his cold.

Visiting the Supply Depot

Stepping out of the plane, he led me to see the First Air Group's air transport equipment depot, which he had designed himself. I saw a large warehouse filled with a complete set of parts, from aircraft tires to electrical components, all neatly organized. The captain was doing his best to utilize his managerial skills. He said, "During the war, we didn't care about anything; we just focused on flying and fighting because the war came first. Plus, with the cruelty of war, if we were distracted by trivial matters, our lives might have been incinerated in the wreckage of a plane. But now, it's after the war, and our focus must shift to group affairs. General Zhou Zhirou (Chou Chih-Jou) has repeatedly instructed us on this. We, these thirty-somethings, should manage affairs rationally and avoid waste. Therefore, since coming to Shanghai to receive air transport training from the Americans, I have postponed my own flying until today. However, I have learned many methods for commanding subordinates and have begun to study management."

An Encouraging Military Unit

As we entered the city from Jiangwan together, Staff Officer Zhu Peifeng parted ways with us at the team headquarters. In the car seat, Shangzhen said: "This person inspires a bit of respect. Like Weng Xinhan (Weng Hsin-Han) from our class, he has a family background that could easily afford him fame and fortune without any effort, but he quietly does the low-level job he loves, filling his life history bit by bit. When his uncle heard about his plans to learn to fly, he felt a sense of quiet satisfaction, letting his nephew sweat and suffer, cooped up in a metal airplane under the scorching sun of the American desert. These past three years of hard work and danger have not been in vain. He has won the praise of the air force authorities and the admiration of his air force comrades. I am quite honored to have his assistance with team affairs. Don't you agree?"

"Yes, with people like you in the air force to serve as cadres, the future of this air force unit is promising." I didn't say what I wanted to say. Words are superfluous when it comes to facts.

### Reader Replies: Medicine and Hygiene

(1) Cao Niande asks: My daughter is three years old, born in August two years ago. She has a blister on the back of her head, sometimes hard, sometimes soft (mostly harder when she cries than usual), that doesn't hurt or itch. It was there from birth, but initially, it was as small as a yellow bean. Since then, it has gradually grown, and it is now the size of a copper coin. I would like to ask: (1) How should this blister be treated? Are there any effective oral or topical medications? (2) If surgery is required, since there are no reliable hospitals in my area, and the child is too young, I plan to wait until she is an adult to have surgery. Is this acceptable?

Also, I have coughed up blood several times and suffer from lung disease. I would like to ask: (1) How should it be treated? If I come to Shanghai for treatment, which hospital is recommended? (2) What is the estimated cost of all medical expenses? Please advise!

[Reply by Dr. Tang Renjin]: (1) The contents of the blister must be examined to determine the treatment plan. Oral or topical medications are ineffective. (2) If it progresses slowly, then wait until adulthood to have surgery. (Re:) (1) An X-ray of the lungs is required to determine the treatment plan. If you come to Shanghai, you can go to the Second or Fourth Municipal Hospital. (2) A third-class hospital room costs approximately 1,500 yuan per day.

(2) A letter from Yide (One Virtue) announces an effective remedy for athlete's foot. I have suffered from athlete's foot for years. Recently, due to effective prevention, I have not had any outbreaks, even though the weather has been hot. The method is to wash the feet daily with potassium permanganate solution (the water in the basin should be slightly pink, not too concentrated). Socks should be changed frequently, preferably daily. Athlete's foot is a type of eczema bacteria. Regularly washing the feet with potassium permanganate can kill the bacteria. Without eczema bacteria, athlete's foot will heal naturally. Wearing fewer leather shoes is even better.

[Reply by Dr. Tang Renjin]: Athlete's foot is a type of filamentous fungus. Washing the feet with potassium permanganate solution has a sterilizing effect. Socks should be changed frequently, and wearing fewer leather shoes provides both cleanliness and ventilation. The method is excellent. If it is not effective, you may want to try Fungs or Dermyko.

(3) Wu Ren asks: I am a man in my forties and have suffered from a small bowel hernia for five months. Is there any other effective remedy besides surgery to cure it permanently? I would be grateful for your answer.

[Reply by Dr. Tang Renjin]: An inguinal hernia, commonly known as a small bowel hernia, has no permanent cure other than surgery.

### Xin Fu Chinese Medicine Store Donates 10,000 Prescriptions

Must be verified by this column or a local physician.

To the Editor: I previously read in your newspaper about Director Zhang Xixian of Fengxiang County, Shaanxi Province, who specializes in an effective prescription for lung disease, which was certified by Dr. Chen Cunren. I followed the prescription and provided it to sick relatives and friends, and it proved effective. The number of Chinese people suffering from lung disease is alarming. The general working class, when they contract this disease, not only cannot afford medicine but also cannot afford medical treatment. Feeling this strongly, I am willing to prepare 10,000 doses of the original prescription in the original proportions to help the poor and sick. Starting immediately, at the entrance of our store at No. 14, Qujiang Lane, No. 522 Hankou Road, we will give ten doses to each patient upon presentation of a written certificate from the patient's local doctor, Dr. Chen Cunren, or this column. If anyone does not wish to receive the donation, we will collect 1,000 yuan per dose to continue to donate more. I am aware that this is just a drop in the bucket, but I hope that other businesses will follow suit. If charitable women are willing to donate, I am willing to assist. In this way, not only will the patients benefit, but also the future of Chinese medicine will be promoted. Respectfully, I wish you peace. Xin Fu Yong Ji Pharmacy, Ren Xia, respectfully.

### The Secret of Ship Registration

To the Editor:

Across from us, there is a branch of the ship registration office. All civilian ships must register, but each registration generates an income that is one or two times greater than the state treasury revenue. Most of those registering are illiterate farmers. Therefore, they pay 1,500 to 2,000 yuan, but the certificate clearly states that it is only 500 yuan. Doesn't all of this 1,500 yuan or so go straight into their pockets?

Chinese farmers are currently on the verge of bankruptcy. We should not allow these simple people to be subjected to invisible exploitation outside the law. Therefore, I dare to appeal to the shipping authorities about the facts I have witnessed, to quickly eliminate this harmful practice. (Qu Xianghuan, a reader from Kunshan)

### The Admirable Ticket Seller

Some time ago, I took the municipal ferry from Pudong to Shanghai on business and, in a hurry, forgot a small bag near the ticket office. Because it contained important documents and cash, I was very anxious. I immediately returned to the original location in Pudong to inquire. When I asked the ticket seller, Mr. Chen, he kindly retrieved and kept it for me, returning it intact. Mr. Chen firmly refused to reveal his real name, and he refused to accept my gratitude of 10,000 yuan. Therefore, I ask your newspaper to publish this to commend his virtue and express my gratitude. Truly, we should admire ticket sellers like Mr. Chen. (Zhou Dagang, a soldier from Shanghai)

### Do You Really Want Gold Bars?

Editor: In the spring of the 26th year (1937), Mr. Cai rented the downstairs room of my friend's house on Maoming Road (Moulmein Road) without any extra fees. After the August 13th Incident and up to today, Mr. Cai has become wealthy through his hardware business. He recently bought a house in Shideli, Maigen Road, with six bars of pure gold. However, he is not properly terminating the lease on my friend's room. Instead, he is demanding that my friend give him one and a half bars of gold to move out. Mr. Cai moved to Maigen Road on June 5th but has locked the room, threatening to pile up goods in it. My friend is truly unable to cope with such unreasonable behavior. My friend is a poor teacher with many children and wants to take back the room for his own use. What effective methods can he use to recover the room from such an unreasonable tenant? In this world of gold bars, this person is too much, bullying people too much. I hope the government will provide a fair judgment! (Fang Xingwu, respectfully)

Spring and Autumn

### Returning to the Old Home (Novel)

— You Chi Zhao

The first winter after the victory, the midday air raid siren had sounded, and crowds poured out of the buildings. The north wind blowing from the Bund was particularly fierce, stinging people's faces. Zhang Ziliang had just walked out of the × stock company. He felt warm all over, full of triumph, thinking, thinking about that most exciting moment.

"Piggy!" An untidily dressed stranger bumped right into him, making him angrily curse. He hurriedly patted his newly made black velvet overcoat and glanced at the person.

Seeing his imposing manner, the man kept silent and walked forward. "Old Zhang," another person greeted him, drawn by the sound of "Piggy," "Oh, Old Wang." Ziliang shook hands with the man and sized him up. "Long time no see, how are you?" Old Wang was also looking over Ziliang from head to toe. "So-so, just getting by, have you had lunch? Let's talk," Ziliang said smugly, wanting to show off to his old friend. Before Old Wang could speak, he shouted shrilly, "Rickshaw! Rickshaw!"

The rickshaw driver expertly sped over. He pulled Old Wang onto the rickshaw and pointed forward. "Fine Dining Restaurant." As he said this, he took out two cigars, handed one to Old Wang, and lit them. "Ah!" He sighed as if taking a deep breath.

Old Wang smoked his cigar, seemingly lost in thought. They were silent for a while.

"Hello!" Two American soldiers also riding in rickshaws urged their drivers to go faster, passing by their rickshaw and playfully greeting them.

"Piggy, top-notch!" Ziliang responded as if he had gained an advantage, laughing heartily, which made Old Wang smile slightly.

Arriving at the Fine Dining Restaurant, Ziliang tossed a U.S. dollar to the rickshaw driver without looking back and pulled Old Wang inside.

The waiter greeted them and asked what they would like to eat.

"Treating a guest, you think I'd eat your special meal? Just pick a few good side dishes, and make it quick!" Ziliang said as if blaming the waiter for being clueless, and glanced at him.

"Old Zhang, where did you come from just now?" Old Wang asked, taking a puff of his cigar.

"×× Stock Company," Ziliang's voice seemed to get louder as he threw the cigarette into a small jar.

"Do you work there?"

"No, just playing around there."

This made Old Wang silent. He remembered that Ziliang and he had been colleagues in the puppet government. After the victory, they were both dismissed. They were both originally poor clerks. How could he have become wealthy in just two months, and where did he get the capital to play the stock market?

"Then, where do you work?" Old Wang couldn't help but ask.

"×× Department's × Office," Ziliang said, tilting his head back and blowing smoke.

"Then, you…"

"I do field work in the office," Ziliang said, interrupting as if he already understood Old Wang's question. "We field workers sign in at the office in the morning and can go on business trips at any time. You know, field work is much better than being a section chief or director sitting in the office, more freedom, and…" Ziliang stuttered at the end, only making a face at Old Wang.

"You're really capable!" Old Wang smiled knowingly, also seeming envious.

"No wonder you have the time and money to go to the stock company."

"In this world, you have to be good at getting ahead. If you don't, how can you stand out? I've become what I am now because of this," Ziliang said, looking at his watch, and continued, "Old Wang, have you found a job yet?"

Old Wang answered with a wry smile. Ziliang also smiled knowingly.

"I think you're just too honest. In these times, how can honest people make a living?" Ziliang said with emotion.

Old Wang looked embarrassed and only sighed.

After the meal, they parted ways. Zhang Ziliang walked to the ×× Department's × Office. Because the stock market was closed in the afternoon, there wasn't much official business that day. He and his colleagues chatted about money, stocks, dance halls, and women, but never mentioned state affairs.

After work, Zhang Ziliang hitched his left foot and, with a cigar in his mouth, rode a car home. His wife had just finished her twelfth round of mahjong.

"Today, how was the market today?" his wife asked eagerly.

"Not like the curves on your body, but a straight line upwards." Ziliang blew a puff of smoke and laughed heartily. "And you, how were your battles?"

"Shut your mouth." His wife raised her hand, the gold ring and diamond ring on her left hand flashing, the dragon and phoenix bracelets dazzling. "You have to compensate me for my losses, I lost almost ten thousand today!"

"What's that? If the stock goes up by one yuan, it's enough for you to lose for a year!" He took the opportunity to put his arm around his wife. Outside, the north wind was still blowing, but their room was warm.

In the evening, Zhang Ziliang told his wife that everyone was optimistic about the stock market in the next two days, and that the price of gold was not rising or falling because the Bank of China was selling it. He wanted to exchange all the gold for stocks, and also exchange his wife's jewelry to increase his strength.

"You see, it went up by 30% today, and if it goes up by another 30% tomorrow, the day after tomorrow… my fortune will be over ten million. When the time comes to sell, we'll go back to our hometown, saving us the trouble of being servile and sucking up to people, watching their faces." Zhang Ziliang gave his wife a definitive conclusion.

His wife also thought it was right. She was even more convinced that her husband was "in the pink" and "invincible." After the victory, he found that way, earning a few gold bars by connecting and collecting. Then he got the idea to buy stocks, and he "won the first battle." He looked even more presentable. If he came up with such a trick again, like cholera bacteria in the human body, multiplying two, two into four, returning to his hometown would make him a wealthy man, buying fields and land, ordering servants around, and having a lifetime of endless fun. Thinking of this, she couldn't help but get excited, swallowing her saliva, and feeling comfortable in her limbs.

The next day, Zhang Ziliang rushed to the office to sign in, then applied for a business trip. He exchanged his jewelry and sold his gold to buy more than 10,000 shares of ×× stock, which was the hottest of the three hot stocks.

The stock was rising, and he watched the report board, sucking wildly on his cigar. The staff member standing by the telephone raised his voice to report the market conditions, and the writers quickly wrote on the board, "35, 40…" Ziliang watched and listened. His face was full of a satisfied smile, and his heart was also beating. The sound of laughter from time to time made him feel like he had gained sympathy. He nodded to acquaintances from time to time, exchanging knowing glances and smiles. He looked at his watch, and it was only a little after ten o'clock. If this continued, wouldn't it rise another 30% by the time the market closed at ten o'clock?

"45, 50…" the reporter was saying, the clerk was writing.

"Five thousand shares, two thousand shares, one thousand shares…" the sounds of transactions were swirling.

"Up again, up, up, up, today there's going to be another record high." People were discussing.

At eleven o'clock, the phone seemed to stop, and the reporter and writer finally had a chance to rest. People talked even more. They were all optimistic that there would be even more record highs tomorrow.

"How's the market?" the person in charge of the telephone asked the other party, as if unable to bear the silence.

"Ah! Something's wrong, the market is slowing down, what's the reason?…" People were all listening.

"35, 40…" Ziliang's heart also beat with the sound waves.

"30, 35…" Ziliang was wildly sucking on his cigar.

"Oh, falling!" After a commotion, it fell silent.

"25, 30…" The cigar was almost finished, burning his hand. Ziliang threw it away and lit another one.

The market closed, and Ziliang went home for lunch. His wife asked him, but he just shook his head.

"I knew something bad was going to happen when you came home for lunch," his wife said quietly.

"The market was still rising when it opened, but it changed at eleven o'clock. I don't know what happened. We're just small fry. Are the big fish eating the small fish again?" Ziliang said worriedly.

"I thought gold was better after all, and practical. Stocks are ultimately empty," his wife said regretfully.

Ziliang did not answer. They spent a lonely afternoon and evening.

Early the next morning, Ziliang rushed to open the newspaper. He saw the joint announcement from the ×× Bureau and the ×× Department banning the trading of stocks. A shadow fell on his heart, heavy as if pressed down by a stone.

He didn't eat breakfast and went out the door. The biting north wind blew, making him shiver. The sky was also gloomy, as if it was going to rain. He went to the × stock company to inquire about news.

"Mr. Zhang, have you read the newspaper? Stock trading is suspended today!" The company staff member told him, shaking his head.

"Um," Ziliang felt hot all over. "Is there a market?" He still had hope, but his voice trembled a little.

"The market is a black market, being shouted in the corridors, but trading is difficult. In this kind of atmosphere, who would still buy ×× shares? The asking price is only '12, 14.'"

"When, when will it reopen?" Ziliang's forehead was sweating.

"Heaven knows!" The staff member shrugged and shook his head.

Zhang Ziliang walked out of the ×× stock company, thinking with his head down, Isn't it over? All his assets are there. If there is no date to resume trading, everything will be frozen… He wondered where he was going.

"Piggy!" As he unconsciously walked into the middle of the road, a trolley bus happened to drive by. The driver quickly braked to avoid the danger, and couldn't help but swear angrily.

Zhang Ziliang was stunned and glared at the driver. Just as he was about to walk back to the sidewalk, a high-speed six-wheeled "express car" drove towards him. Ziliang was knocked to the ground. People gathered around to watch in the cold wind, but Zhang Ziliang had already returned to his old home!

### Flying Together, Staying Together – 94

— Zhao Qing Ge

These were all things that Lihua could not understand! She gave Dong Shaoling a special kind of feeling with all her innocence; she was quietly and secretly infatuated with a soul; she wanted to possess this soul for herself; but all these things were what Dong Shaoling could not have guessed, could not have been conscious of. Between them, both tangibly and intangibly, there was a vast distance. This distance was not something human effort could overcome; this distance caused them to diverge into two different realms; this distance created an eternal, irreparable, and inexplicable regret!

Only Liu Ziyun could see this situation clearly, but she found it inconvenient to pierce through their vague emotions and did not want Lihua’s pure and fragile heart to experience even more sorrow! Because Liu Ziyun’s feelings for Lihua were singular. She had almost donated all her emotions, willing to sacrifice everything for Lihua’s happiness, to be a loyal protector for life. In other words, Liu Ziyun was an extremely mechanical and stubborn expert in mathematical physics; one who had to concentrate her feelings on a single object to be satisfied! When she had once given all her feelings to a person, could even say entrusted them to a person; and this person—(her husband)—then returned all her emotions, she was simply driven mad by the pain! For this reason, she vowed: she would find another object to "give" to. She hoped that this object would be a child, even if it was a dog! She would be willing; but she could never give herself to a man again; a man who was fickle, treacherous, fond of the new, and tired of the old. Therefore, she would not marry again; she had been single for five years, she regarded marriage as a fearsome road! Now, her outstanding case was resolved, and she was glad to have finally found an object to which she could unconditionally give all her emotions, and this object was in need of her emotions. And so, she was happy, contentedly happy!

Kaifeng also had remnants of warlords, so the flames of the Northern Expedition spread to Kaifeng, which meant that Lihua had to follow Madam and Zhang Xian on their third wandering journey. The destination of the wandering was Wuhan, so they were preparing to proceed towards this new goal.

### Benevolence and Love

— Xie Beicheng

In a very good elementary school civics textbook, I read the following sentences:

"I protect animals that are beneficial to mankind."

"I love the compatriots of my country."

Below these two sentences were parentheses, with the words "Benevolence and Love" annotated inside, which means to explain the meaning of "Benevolence and Love" to the children so that they can practice being good citizens.

I have no objection to the people who wrote the book. I said earlier that this is a good book, but I thought of another thing. Because here I discovered that "Benevolence and Love" also has its limits. Times have progressed, and the scope of "Benevolence and Love" has gradually narrowed.

Buddhism speaks of cause and effect, which is to persuade people to resolve hatred; Buddhism forbids killing, which is to say that life is lovely. Underneath Shakyamuni's golden lotus flower, there are many poisonous snakes and beasts. In the Western Paradise, there is neither you nor me. This kind of broad love is not just for "animals that are beneficial to mankind." Jesus admonished people: "Love your enemies." We grow up in this world and gradually learn to be clever. We seem to be cultivating hatred, not only making it take root in our hearts, but also trying to pass this hatred on to our descendants. But Jesus was nailed to the cross, his eyes looking at those lawyers, Hebrews, tax collectors, and those hypocrites, and said, "Father, forgive their sins!"

The teachings of Buddha and the doctrines of Jesus were eventually accepted and have been passed down for more than a thousand years. They also speak of benevolence and love, but it is different from ours. Is it that the years have tormented people too much?

I don't know how the teachers sitting on the podium explain those two sentences in the book. Do they also explain the opposite meaning to the children?

"Do not love animals that are not beneficial to people."

"I do not love foreigners!"

In this era when the United Nations is being sought, it may not be very appropriate. I was silent in the study and finally realized the cleverness of the author, because he lived in a world where foreigners were rampant. This pain was only recently wiped away. The place where he lived was still habitually called a concession. Therefore:

"I love the compatriots of my country!"

Implicitly containing hatred for those who are not of my race. Who do we say is right? Who is wrong? For example, in 1946, DDT insecticide is very popular. Monks are made of flesh and fear insect bites, so DDT is also sprayed in the meditation hall, while they are still chanting "I Buddha's compassion!"

To put it more simply, in this world war, didn't Jesus's followers also carry guns and go to the front line? Not only did they not love their enemies, but their hatred was probably even deeper than others! This kind of love is planted on hatred.

I don't hope that people will talk about benevolence and love, but plant love on hatred:

"I hate animals that are beneficial to mankind."

"I hate the compatriots of my country."

We have not experienced this kind of life. Isn't it said that there are still bacterial weapons being invented?

I only hope that mankind has learned to be clever and more practical. Children are pure, let's not deceive them!

### International Knowledge and Peace Conference

Soviet Concessions Lead to Regularly Scheduled Conference

Special Compilation by this Newspaper's Translation Department South

The convening of a peace conference and the signing of peace treaties mark the formal end of war, so everyone hopes for their swift arrival.

Due to the immense scope and complexity of the Second World War, its conclusion requires three peace conferences: one for Italy, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, and Finland; one for Germany; and one for Japan. Only after all three peace conferences have been successfully completed and the peace treaties have been formally signed will the world return to its original state and gain a new look.

The twenty-one-nation peace conference scheduled to be held in Paris on the 29th of this month is specifically to discuss the peace treaties with Italy, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, and Finland. In other words, it is the first of the three peace conferences. However, before the decision to convene this peace conference, countless arguments had already taken place, with many twists and turns, displaying the utmost in changeability. Now, let's briefly describe what happened.

Discussions on the peace treaties with Italy, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, and Finland began at the first Foreign Ministers Conference held in London in September 1945, but they reached a stalemate due to difficulties over procedural issues. At that time, agreement was reached on certain aspects of the peace treaty with Italy, and concrete progress was made in the preparatory work for the peace treaties with Finland and Romania and Bulgaria. The main obstacle to the conference was whether the drafting of the peace treaties should be limited to the countries that signed the surrender documents. To break this deadlock, the foreign ministers of the three major powers met again in Moscow in December 1945. As a result, it was decided that only member groups who had signed the surrender documents could participate in drafting the peace treaties with the five countries. In other words, the peace treaty with Italy was drafted by Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France; the peace treaties with Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary were drafted by Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union; and the peace treaty with Finland was drafted by Britain and the Soviet Union.

Based on the decision of the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference, the representatives of the four foreign ministers in London were ordered to separately draft the peace treaties with the five countries. As soon as the draft peace treaties were ready, a peace conference would be held by the five member groups of the Foreign Ministers Conference and sixteen countries in the United Nations that had made practical contributions to the military resistance against European enemy countries for final discussion. At one point, the peace conference was scheduled to be held on May 1 this year.

However, the representatives of the four foreign ministers encountered many difficulties in drafting the peace treaties. The obstacles were so numerous that it seemed as if they had already entered a dead end. The peace conference scheduled to be held on May 1 had to be postponed. At this critical moment, U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes advocated holding another four-nation Foreign Ministers Conference in Paris. The complexity of the problem and the importance of the relations required the foreign ministers of the four countries to personally step in. As a result, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France all expressed their support, and the conference was convened on April 25. During the conference, the four foreign ministers reviewed the difficulties encountered in drafting the peace treaties one by one. As a result of the negotiations, some minor issues were agreed upon, but the major issues remained unresolved, and the parties were at a stalemate. In particular, opinions differed greatly on the issue of Trieste and its hinterland, the issue of Italian colonies, and the issue of navigation on the Danube, and the situation almost reached an irreversible point. At that time, a pessimistic atmosphere pervaded the globe.

The foreign ministers of the four powers argued fiercely in the meeting room, but outside the room, they were "good friends" and were very cordial.

Darkness Reveals Light

Fortunately, a ray of light suddenly appeared in the darkness: the Paris Foreign Ministers Conference did not declare failure, but decided to postpone it and reconvene it a month later. Counting on this turning point, the four foreign ministers finally gathered again in Paris on June 15.

Judging from the problems faced by the Four Foreign Ministers Conference, they were indeed intricate and complex. Each country, for its own benefit, had to fight each other and was unwilling to concede. However, the world is, after all, a world that has suffered from war. Prolonged chaos leads to a desire for order, which is not only the mentality of the general public but also the wish of the foreign ministers representing the people of various countries. Therefore, in this Paris Foreign Ministers Conference, all parties tried their best to find compromise solutions and finally reached compromise solutions on the previously unresolved important issues. For example, a compromise boundary line was drawn for the Italian southern border, and Trieste was placed under international co-management; the issue of Italian colonies adopted a avoid the important and dwell on the trivial approach and was postponed for resolution until a year later, only the statement in the peace treaty with Italy that Italy abandoned its colonial claims was needed; on the point of Danube navigation, the four countries had recognized that, for the benefit of world peace and world trade, it was necessary to freely open the Danube and its navigable tributaries and canals under conditions of complete equality for all countries. Other issues, such as the issue of Italian reparations, the issue of the disposal of the remaining Italian fleet, and the issue of the withdrawal of British and American troops from Italy and Soviet troops from Bulgaria, have all been agreed upon, so preparing the draft peace treaty is no longer very difficult. The long-awaited twenty-one-nation peace conference was finally decided to open grandly on July 29.

Invitation Issues, Soviet Concessions

However, before the decision was made to convene the peace conference and issue invitations, there were still considerable twists and turns: one was the issue of inviting countries, and the other was the issue of the peace conference's procedures. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov insisted that China should not be one of the inviting countries of the peace conference but could only be an invited country. U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes sternly rebuked him on the spot, believing that this was a completely wrong and unnecessary move, tantamount to insulting China. Our Foreign Minister Wang also made a solemn statement, believing that this move violated the Moscow Agreement. Finally, under pressure from the public opinion of various countries, the Soviet Union abandoned its attitude and accepted the method of the peace conference chairman being rotated by the foreign ministers of China, Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France, and the peace conference being convened in the name of the entire Foreign Ministers Conference. As for the issue of procedures, there was also some dispute. Molotov insisted that the procedures of the peace conference should be decided by the four powers and sent out with the invitations, but British Foreign Secretary Bevin and U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes resolutely stated that the issue of the procedures of the peace conference should be decided by the entire twenty-one-nation conference. Finally, a compromise solution was adopted: the Foreign Ministers Conference decided on a few principles as suggestions and sent them to the participating countries for adoption.

After so many twists and turns, the twenty-one-nation peace conference was finally decided to be held in Paris on the 29th of this month. Peace-loving people all over the world can wait and see.

Before the opening of the peace conference, peace-loving people naturally hope that its work will proceed smoothly and reap fruitful results, and that the peace conferences with Germany and Japan can also be convened as soon as possible, so that the world can quickly return to its original state and move towards the path of postwar peace and prosperity.

World News

Paris, because of the housing shortage, the government authorities have recently stipulated that each person shall not live in more than one bedroom, one living room, and one dining room, with the kitchen being outside. For families with several members, this proportion is extrapolated. "Surplus houses must be rented out!"

The most difficult railway to build in the world is a section of the Peruvian Central Railway. This section of railway is only 138 miles long, but it took twelve years to build. The road starts at sea level and winds its way over a plateau 15,000 feet above sea level. A total of 65 tunnels and 67 bridges were built. Due to the difficulty of the project, 11,000 of the 13,000 road workers died in accidents.

The most modern fabric in the world turns red when red light shines on it, green when green light shines on it, and a blue when blue light shines on it. This is made of glass-like (plastic) fibers, which can turn into various colors due to the different curvatures of the radiation surface. This fabric also has a great advantage: it does not need to be washed, just wipe it with a wet towel and it is clean again.

Housewives often find it a headache that matches, if accidentally placed in a relatively humid place, will soon not light. But now, this is no longer a problem. A waterproof match is already on sale in the market. This match is first immersed in six kinds of glue solutions, and after drying, it is coated with a very thin transparent film. You can soak this match in water for 24 hours, and it can still be used the same way when you take it out.

Mysterious Hungary - Million Dollar Bills Used to Light Cigarettes, Legislators' Annual Salary Only Enough to Buy a Pound of Sugar, By Mo

To an American soldier, Budapest, the capital of Hungary, is truly a baffling place. In a luxurious hotel, a bottle of the finest champagne costs only forty-five cents. In the large companies on Váci Street, you can buy silk stockings, ivory, or valuable porcelain with just a few odd bills. A sergeant's meager salary is enough to buy the deed to an office or apartment. But to a Hungarian himself, this place is equally baffling. A member of parliament's annual salary of 650,000 pengős (Hungarian currency) is barely enough to buy a pound of sugar. A two-story apartment with a basement has a monthly rent limit of 20,000 pengős, which is just enough for the landlord to take a single tram ride.

Last week, the pengő, which had already soared to an alarming astronomical figure, continued to rise. In 1939, one pengő was worth 29.12 U.S. cents. Last month, one U.S. dollar was only worth 1,000,000,000,000,000 pengős, but by July 3, it had risen to 800,000,000,000,000,000 pengős. Last month, Hungarians were still talking about "million pengő bills" and "ten million pengő bills," but last week they could only say "ten thousand million pengő bills." Now, it is impossible to say, so they have to use "brown bills" (i.e., 100,000,000,000,000 pengő bills) and "blue bills" (i.e., 1,100,000,000,000,000 pengő bills) to represent them. This situation is a thousand times worse than the German mark in 1923, and the Hungarian government's price control policy has long since completely collapsed.

The government's policy originally only hoped that the prices of daily necessities could remain stable within a day. Wages were calculated daily. But unfortunately, prices rose hourly. The situation is completely hopeless, because there is no hope of foreign aid, and Hungary itself has been ravaged by war and has no way to stabilize the economy. Now, on the streets of Budapest, no one would bother to bend down and pick up a million pengő bill that fell on the ground, because the only use for a million pengő bill is probably to light a cigarette. Using a million-dollar bill to light a cigarette, how extravagant are the Hungarians, China sighs in inferiority.

Please Pay Attention, Post Office By Shao Fu

Today, we are publishing this long letter at the expense of space for two reasons: first, we have always praised the personnel system of the post office and hope to draw the attention of the authorities to thoroughly investigate this matter, because we will never regard it as a personal problem of Mr. Zhang Yourong; second, using people only for their virtue and ability, rewarding merits and punishing demerits, being impartial, not favoring those one likes, not disliking those one dislikes, promotions and demotions, births, old age, sickness, and death must be governed by law. An organization, a career, can be like this, this organization must be sound, this career must prosper, otherwise, it will increase social chaos, and the rampant flow of selfish desires. People who often say that people's hearts are not as good as they used to be, cannot say that this has nothing to do with it.

Free Talk is the readers' garden. Even a small matter is a social problem, and we will never ignore it and let it go easily; however, in order to suit various interests, we do not intend to use this method to discuss problems and publish all incoming letters.

The following is the original letter from Mr. Zhang Yourong:

Morning reading your publication: "A Letter" is an appeal from four gentlemen of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank against the unreasonable transfer by the authorities.

The gentleman is very sympathetic, but the letter lacks concrete facts, so it is not convenient to publish it.

The gentleman said again: "An organization or a group's personnel administration has its own regulations, and if necessary, and reasonable and legal, it has the right to make any disposal." Sir! You are very right, the following paragraph of facts is to serve as an echo of the appeal of the four gentlemen.

My deceased son served in the Wuhu First-Class Post Office as a postal assistant, 26 years old this year. He entered the post office at the age of 20 and was ordered to be sent to Wuhu. The hardship of postal life in the occupied area is not comparable to that of civil servants in the rear, and he finally survived for more than five long years. On September 17 last year, he asked for leave to return to Shanghai, and then became ill and stayed in Shanghai. He immediately submitted an application for sick leave to the personnel section of the Shanghai Management Bureau, twice in succession, each time for 20 days, and it was repeatedly certified by the bureau's doctor and approved by the assistant. The initial approval period seemed to be from October 11, 34, for 20 days, and later the Wuhu Post Office sent a letter correcting it to October 7, 34, due to the distinction between personal leave and sick leave. Continued leave was from October 27, 34, for a total of 40 days in two times. Because my son still had four days of personal leave according to postal regulations, he went to Wuhu on November 20 to cancel his leave. How could he know that on the fourth day, the director handed him an order from the Anhui Management Bureau: "To be handled as retirement due to illness from October 12."

My son has served in the Wuhu Post Office for more than five years, and there should be detailed records of his past sick leave. The initial sick leave certificate issued by the Shanghai Bureau was sent to Wuhu on October 16. Later, the date was corrected in the letter. Then, the Wuhu Post Office issued an instruction on October 24: "To find another unlimited guarantee." He immediately complied and sent the certificate to Wuhu. The continued leave certificate was sent on October 30. After that, the Wuhu Post Office did not give any reply or instruction. According to this, my son's sick leave should have been approved without a doubt. Because he was loyal to his duties, he did not take much rest and rushed to Wuhu to report for duty. How could he know that the Anhui Management Bureau had already handled his retirement due to illness at an early date.

Retirement due to illness is a matter of handling whether others have a job or not. If the post office made a prior or due date notice, my son would never have left Shanghai to go there, but the post office actually issued an order more than forty days after the expiration date. Its impact on my sick son is truly unbearable to recall.

At that time, my son felt that his health was still good, and the Wuhu Post Office was in urgent need of manpower, so he immediately submitted a request to the Anhui Management Bureau to allow him to resume his post in the original bureau. How could he know that the resumption of duty was only approved in March of this year, and he was transferred to the Hefei Post Office and received 50,000 yuan in travel expenses.

After more than four months of unemployment after the illness, my son's body could not support the stimulation. On March 24, he was admitted to the Yefan Mountain Hospital in Wuhu, hoping to recover soon and go to Hefei to resume his post. His expression of loyalty to his duties is still vivid in my memory. On April 4, the Wuhu Post Office instructed that he must go to Hefei to resume his post before April 15. On April 11, he was urged to leave with the same instruction and blamed him for staying in Wuhu. If he exceeded the deadline, he would not be allowed to resume his post. Therefore, on April 16, his condition became critical, and he finally died in the hospital on April 21.

Being able to resume his post but not giving him the resumption of duty, not being able to resume his post and forcing him to resume his duty, this is what the gentleman called: "Having the right to make any disposal." On June 27, I reported the above facts to the Shanghai Management Bureau, and later received its approval on July 2: "This matter belongs to the Anhui Management Bureau's jurisdiction and has been transferred to the bureau to request a thorough investigation of who abused their power and replied directly." To this day, I have not seen any reply.

More than three months have passed since my son died, and I have not seen any notice from the post office, nor have I had the insurance policy returned or any condolences. They treat my son's career and life as a child's play. The post office is an organization with a perfect personnel system, and it must be that my son's human relations are not yet complete, and this is the result he got.

Four gentlemen, the above facts are your reply, what do you think?

Zhang Yourong respectfully presents on 35, 7, 22.

Protest By Chen Lin

There was an article in the Free Talk on the 19th, "Nanjing Jeeps, Prohibited from Carrying Girls," which I read with regret!

Do women not even have the qualification to ride in Jeeps? According to the author of the article: "Because there are women, more gasoline will be used, and more wronged ghosts will be run over by the wheels." In fact, that may be the case, but can women be called "harbingers of disaster" for this reason? According to this, aren't men also "cauldrons of disaster"? The number of people run over by male drivers is countless! Furthermore, aren't most of the people riding in Jeeps for a joyride men, not just women? Why are all women not allowed to ride in Jeeps, while the family members of military agencies and friends of drivers, as long as they are male, can freely drive around in the streets? Is this saving gasoline?

I think this is insulting to women. I hope Chief of General Staff Chen will immediately withdraw his order. If you really want to save gasoline, you should prohibit everyone from riding in Jeeps for a joyride.

A Consistent Demand Re-征 By Xun Zheng

In the past two days, "Free Talk" has been talking about traffic problems continuously. These opinions, as Mr. Shao Fu said, "It represents the general opinion of the citizens."

Why is the tram order in Shanghai so bad? Here are just what I have seen with my own eyes:

The general situation is not very good. Except for Jing'an Temple and the Bund, where there are queues, the other small stations are a mess. When a tram comes, people swarm up and scramble to be the first, and as a result, people who want to get on cannot get on, and people who want to get off cannot get off, and everyone complains. Sometimes even the Bund will make an exception and not queue up, and people will squeeze onto the tram in a chaotic manner.

Also, the queue was originally well-ordered, but some special classes suddenly rush out of the queue and catch up head-on. If time is urgent, they will even climb in through the windows, and the passengers who have been waiting for a long time will be turned away.

On the tram, the only skill of these special people is not to buy tickets. The conductor does not even dare to ask. If they happen to ask them a question, they will show a stern face or even fly into a rage and resort to violence.

Secondly, it is common for trams not to stop at stations. Conversely, it is also common for trams to stop before reaching the station. But when people of special classes want to board the tram, no matter where they are, they just wave their hand, and as long as the driver sees them, he will immediately stop the tram and invite them to come up.

Shanghai's transportation is in a very difficult period, especially the tram. There are few cars and many passengers, and coupled with the lack of order, how can it be done well?

I hope that no matter who you are, you should know that: living today, if you do not know what order is, it is a shame! This is the unanimous demand of all 3.7 million citizens of Shanghai.

"If You Want to Get Promoted and Make a Fortune, Don't Take Another Road; If You Want to Engage in Private Business and Bribery, Try Entering This Door!"

A Few Things About Wu Yuan By Bai Lian

The gate of the Suzhou Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau is hung with the couplet: "If you want to get promoted and make a fortune, please take another road; if you want to engage in private business and bribery, do not enter this door!" But the more touching it is written, the more unspeakable the actions are. The case of the two section chiefs Yu and Huang of the bureau forcing a woman, Chang Dong'e, to death due to bribery has been delayed until today and has not been concluded. The court has announced that it will be publicly tried this month, and the people of Suzhou attach great importance to it. I am afraid that the trial will go on and on, and the trial will be fruitless. Someone jokingly changed the couplet to: "If you want to get promoted and make a fortune, don't take another road; if you want to engage in private business and bribery, try entering this door!" It is an extreme expression of ridicule and scolding!

Recently, Suzhou has strictly prohibited underground banks. Underground banks are loan sharking shops that secretly move cash in and out for high-interest exploitation. The interest rates of these underground banks are really scary; the highest is as high as 48% per month. Underground banks settle interest either every five days or every ten days, but most of them settle every ten days. People in the industry call "fen" "liang," such as ten liang, which is one "jiao." The police station summoned the persons in charge of all the underground banks in Suzhou to make a guarantee, but as a result, transactions are still being carried out in secret.

The number of underground banks that were summoned and strictly prohibited is as many as 700, which is really shocking. After being summoned, some of the persons in charge are members of the business community and are afraid that news reporters will take it as news and publish it, which will not look good on their faces. Therefore, several persons in charge who care about their reputation jointly allocated 10 million yuan to all the large and small newspapers in Suzhou, and there are also regulations: 2 million yuan for large newspapers and 1 million yuan for small newspapers. The size of the newspaper is determined by whether the newspaper is a broadsheet or an octavo. As a result, the newspapers that refused to sell their newspaper spirit were all of noble character and integrity, and fought for the newspaper business!

Also A Small Matter By Qi Zhi

In the past, because there was a distinction between the Public Concession and the French Concession, there was not much hindrance even though trams had the same route numbers but took different routes.

Now that the concessions have been recovered and Shanghai has been completely unified, the trams with the same route numbers still exist in the old two concessions, which is really inconvenient.

Residents can neither call them the "number X" of the "X Concession," nor can they conveniently say they are the "number X" of the old British or French Concessions, nor can they distinguish them by District 1 or District 8, which is really a headache!

It would be best to have a way to change the route numbers!

### Remembering Two Diplomats

— Ping Qi

Last Saturday, the Shanghai cultural community held a tea party at the International Hotel to welcome Mr. Hu Shih back from his travels. At the tea party, both Mr. Hu and Mr. Yen Jun Lao delivered speeches with extremely beautiful diction. It was my great honor to attend such a grand occasion. However, I was also reminded of a Qinghua University anniversary celebration ten years ago, because the speakers invited to speak on that occasion were precisely the same two gentlemen who spoke last Saturday – Mr. Yen and Mr. Hu. Moreover, just like last Saturday's tea party, Mr. Yen was wearing a Western suit, and Mr. Hu was wearing a traditional Chinese gown. The vicissitudes of the world over these ten years have undergone countless changes! To hear these two gentlemen speak again now is truly deeply moving!

I remember in Mr. Yen's speech ten years ago, he mentioned the story of riding a small donkey out of Xizhimen to Qinghua Garden for work. At that time, Mr. Yen was the "Director-General" of "Qinghua Academy," which, in other words, was the position of the president of Qinghua University today. Mr. Hu Shih took the Qinghua scholarship examination to study in the United States during the time when Mr. Yen was in charge of school affairs.

Therefore, to use an old saying, Mr. Yen was indeed Mr. Hu's "teacher." Mr. Yen said at the tea party last Saturday, "When Mr. Shih came to Qinghua to take the examination to study abroad, I also happened to have a little connection with Qinghua." Although he used the utmost diplomatic and tactful language, his meaning was probably referring to this relationship.

When I was at Qinghua, out of curiosity, I looked up the exam papers from the year Mr. Hu took the examination to study abroad. In the year that Mr. Hu went abroad, the first person admitted was Mr. Zhao Yuanren, whose grades were so good that they could not be any better, with a total average of around 95 points. Mr. Hu did not seem very pleased, because it seemed that a total of six people went abroad that year, and Mr. Hu seemed to have ranked sixth, and the score did not seem to have reached 60 points – I don't know why, but I suddenly thought of another ambassador, Gu Shaochuan.

I have boundless admiration for Mr. Hu's morality and writings, but what I admire most about him is his wit and sense of humor. Therefore, I deeply believe that if he were to flip through "Free Talk" and see this little essay, he probably wouldn't be angry.
