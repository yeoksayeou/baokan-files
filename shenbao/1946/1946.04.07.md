### Soviet Troops Withdraw from Northeast in Batches; All to Return Home Before Month's End; Malinovsky Departs Changchun

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 6th Dispatch] Official News: The takeover of Northeast China by the National Army is progressing well on all fronts, now reaching Changtu in the north and Benxi in the south. Liang Huasheng is currently directing operations in Kaiyuan, and the Beining Railway is extremely congested with troop trains every day. Zheng Dongguo, acting commander of the Northeast Security Command, arrived in Panyang on the 6th.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 6th Dispatch] It is rumored that the Soviet troops in Changchun will complete their withdrawal by the 15th. If the Northeast Executive Headquarters cannot take effective steps before the 15th, Changchun will soon become a battlefield. It is said that Communist troops are gathering in the four suburbs of Changchun, and it is rumored that Jiutai has been captured, while Nong'an is also under siege by Communist troops.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 6th Dispatch] Marshal Malinovsky left for Harbin by car at 11:40 AM on the 6th to return to his country. Dong Yanping, head of our military delegation, led all the members of the delegation to the station to see him off. Zhang Peizhe and Yang Zuoren, members of the delegation, accompanied Marshal Malinovsky to Harbin.

[Another Dispatch] Before leaving Changchun this afternoon, Marshal Malinovsky had a cordial conversation with Dong Yanping, the head of our military delegation, at the station for forty minutes. Marshal Malinovsky stated that he would stay in Harbin for a week and would maintain contact with our military delegation until the last Soviet troops withdrew from the north. It is reported that Marshal Malinovsky repeatedly emphasized the importance and inevitability of friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union today.

[Central News Agency, Harbin, 6th Dispatch] Marshal Malinovsky and Troshenko, along with their headquarters staff, arrived in Harbin at 5:40 PM on the 6th.

[Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 5th Dispatch] The Soviet troops in Northeast China have officially announced the withdrawal date, and all troops will be withdrawn to the Soviet Union by April 30th. During the meeting between Lieutenant General Dong Yanping and Lieutenant General Troshenko on the 3rd of this month, Lieutenant General Troshenko was ordered to announce the withdrawal date of the Soviet troops: (1) All staff members of Marshal Malinovsky's headquarters will leave Changchun for their country on April 5th. The Soviet troops in Changchun will complete their withdrawal on the 14th and 15th. The commander of the Karlov city defense will be the last to leave Changchun, and the epidemic prevention outposts in the suburbs will be withdrawn on the 10th. (2) The Soviet troops in Harbin will complete their withdrawal on the 25th. (3) The withdrawal from Jilin City will be completed from the 3rd to the 16th. (4) Qiqihar will be evacuated on the 26th or 27th. (5) Mudanjiang will be evacuated on the 26th or 29th. (6) The areas north of Bei'an, Jiamusi, and Boli can also be evacuated before the 10th. According to the above plan, all Soviet troops can be withdrawn to the Soviet Union before April 30th.

[United Press, Shenyang, 6th Dispatch] Authoritative sources have learned that the New First Army, equipped with American weaponry, is expanding its advance towards Sipingjie. Meanwhile, it is learned here that the Soviet troops plan to completely withdraw from Changchun before April 14th. The Communist troops have attempted to contain the advance of the National Army in Sipingjie and have increased their forces in the Changchun area, apparently aiming to occupy Changchun when the Soviet troops complete their withdrawal. This action has hindered the advance of the main force of the New First Army and prevented them from reaching Changchun. However, a large number of National Army troops have crossed the railway blockade line in Sipingjie, mostly on foot, with some traveling by car, attempting to reach the city before the Communist troops can overcome the local garrison troops. According to recent estimates, there are 7,000 National Army troops in Changchun, including 1,000 troops airlifted from the Beiping area several months ago, 3,000 local militia members, and 3,000 policemen.

[Central News Agency, Seoul, 5th Dispatch, United Press] According to visitors from North Korea, approximately 50,000 Soviet troops have entered the Soviet-occupied zone of Korea from Northeast China. The total number of Soviet troops in North Korea is currently 106,000. There is frequent movement of Soviet troops between Pyongyang and the 38th parallel, with approximately 40,000 Soviet troops in that area.

Changchun is Surrounded on All Sides; Security Forces in the City Strengthen Defense Work

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 6th Dispatch] Changchun is now surrounded on all sides by Communist troops, with the closest vanguard only eight kilometers away from Changchun. In addition, Communist troops are stationed in Kaoshantun, 12 kilometers west of the city, Quantoutai, 15 kilometers southeast of the city, and Xiangshuiquan, 12.5 kilometers away, while the area north of the city has become a place where Communist troops from Dehui frequently appear. The number of those lurking in the city is still inestimable, and the defensive work built by the city security forces is being actively expanded and strengthened.

[Another Dispatch] The number of Communist troops around Changchun is still increasing. From the 4th to the 5th, an additional 26,000 troops were added in Buhai and Halaha, north of Changchun, reportedly transported south by train from areas such as Biancheng near Harbin. On the 4th, the Communist troops also disarmed the railway protection team in Buhai.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 6th Dispatch] The cities of Lindian and Fuyu, belonging to Nenjiang Province, have been captured by Communist troops. Furthermore, Qiqihar, where the provincial government is located, is now in a state of encirclement.

[United Press, Chongqing, 6th Dispatch] Observers here are closely monitoring the development of the situation in Northeast China in the next ten days, believing that this matter has a significant impact on the situation in the coming years. The Soviet troops are preparing to withdraw completely by the end of April and have notified the Chinese authorities of their withdrawal steps. The content of the notification has not yet been disclosed. This notification may allow the National Army to take over important cities in Northeast China before the Communist troops arrive. If the Soviet troops fail to hand over the main cities to the National Army, relations between China and the Soviet Union may become strained. Whether the Executive Headquarters will go to Northeast China to work, whether the civil war will break out, or whether it will be resolved by means of settling disputes can also be largely decided in the next ten days.

### Zhenjiang Establishes Police Academy

Students are surplus officers

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 6th Dispatch] The military and communications departments plan to establish a national police academy in Zhenjiang to train highway, railway, and waterway security personnel. Recently, the Inspection Department of the Military Affairs Commission sent personnel to decide on using Jinshan Temple or the former enemy-puppet alcohol factory as the school site. The first group of students will be approximately 3,000 to 5,000, all surplus officers.

### Military Trio Discuss; No Agreement Yet Reached

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 6th Dispatch] The military trio from Chongqing has not yet arrived on the 6th, indicating that a detailed plan to resolve the Northeast issue has not yet been agreed upon. However, the Northeast Executive Headquarters may depart before the trio arrives, as General Beedle of the United States is urging this matter urgently and wishes to see peace achieved in the Northeast as soon as possible. Furthermore, after the trio arrives in Shenyang, the Shenyang Central Group may be renamed the Northeast Branch of the Mediation Executive Department.

[United Press, Chongqing, 6th Dispatch] The military trio, consisting of representatives from the government, the Communist Party, and the United States, had intended to travel to the Northeast, but has not yet done so. There are two reasons for this: (1) The committee has not reached a consensus on the basic opinions on how to handle the Northeast issue. (2) Chen Cheng, the government representative, is currently suffering from severe stomach illness. Reliable sources say: The government may send another representative. The committee should hold a meeting first to reach an agreement on the disputed points between the two sides, otherwise, it would be meaningless for the three representatives to go to the Northeast.

[United Press, Shenyang, 5th Dispatch] The main purpose of Brigadier General Beedle's flight to Northeast China today is to obtain some guarantees from the Communist Party to satisfy the hopes of the government. The government's opinion seems to be that there is no real Communist military activity in the Northeast, only "guerrillas and bandits."

### Soviet Administrative Officials Refuse to Withdraw from Fushun

Furniture in Changchun Emptied

[United Press, Fushun, 6th Dispatch] Twenty-three Soviet administrative officials are still "entrenched" behind wire mesh fortifications in the best buildings in Fushun City today. In a note sent to General Zhao Gongwu, commander of the 52nd Army, the Soviet officials firmly asserted that under the Yalta Agreement, the entire Fushun coal mining area, including two underground mines and two of the world's most productive open-pit mines, should belong to the Changchun Railway Company. The Changchun Railway was originally a joint Chinese-Soviet venture but is now managed solely by the Soviet Union. The twenty-three Soviet officials are all wearing Changchun Railway uniforms. When the Chinese authorities request their withdrawal, they consistently reply with firm words: "We are unwilling to withdraw until we receive an order from Stalin to withdraw."

[United Press, Fushun, 6th Dispatch] The Soviet Union has turned Fushun coal mining city into a "second Shenyang." Important machinery and equipment in its coal mines and power plants have been dismantled, causing this industrial hub in southern Dong Provinces to fall silent. Since the mines were occupied by Soviet troops, the daily output of bituminous coal has decreased from 10,000 tons to 1,000 tons.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 5th Dispatch] It is generally expected that once the situation stabilizes, the business of furniture merchants, especially wood merchants, will be very prosperous, and the prices of various woodenware and lumber will also be high. Furniture, doors and windows in various fire buildings in the city have been emptied. Tables, chairs, beds, sofas, carpets, wardrobes, screens, and even coat racks and coffee tables are piled up like mountains at the station every day. Train transportation is very frequent, and fully loaded ten-wheeled trucks are still continuously transporting them to the station.

According to the American representative of the group, Bai Lishi, the conflict has now stopped, but the issue of responsibility still needs to be further negotiated.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 5th Dispatch] Major General Bu Yasheng, head of the government group of the Zhangjiakou Executive Headquarters, came to Beiping for instructions. It is said that the main difficulty there is that the Communist troops do not recognize the National Army guerrillas within the territory of Zhangjiakou County.

[United Press, Guangzhou, 6th Dispatch] According to a certain newspaper here, the American representative of the Executive Headquarters declared last night that the National-Communist problem in Guangdong Province has been resolved, and the Hainan Island issue is currently being discussed in Chongqing.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 6th Dispatch] Military intelligence indicates that the Communist troops in Chaharbei gathered two regiments of troops from Wanquan Yong'an and launched an attack at 7 PM on March 29th on the Nationalist Army's 3rd Company of Zhang Tiancong's department, which was located in the Tai Ma Lin Dahugou area northwest of Wanquan. The department eventually broke through the encirclement and retreated on the morning of the 30th due to being outnumbered, with heavy casualties.

### Temporary Agreement Established for the Repair of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 5th Dispatch] Chen Luhua and others from the Railway Management Section of the Executive Headquarters, along with three section chiefs, established a temporary agreement for the repair of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway with the local government and the Communist Party during their return journey from Jinan, namely (1) South of Da Wenkou, the Communist Party allows repair work to begin southwards, with the exception of isolating the Honggou and Dongbeibao stations. (2) The northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway can be repaired northwards from Yancheng. Repair work has now begun on these two sections.

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 5th Dispatch] The details of the railway repair work in various sections of Shandong Province since its commencement are recorded as follows: Repair work south of Tai'an, from March 7th to March 29th, restored a length of 20 kilometers and 170 meters. Repair work north of Yancheng, from March 23rd to March 31st, restored a length of 23 kilometers and 180 meters. Repair work east of Zhangdian, from March 8th to March 23rd, restored a length of 21 kilometers and 630 meters. Other sections such as north of Yanzhou, south of Dezhou, west of Tanjiafang, east of Xiawantun, and west of Caijiazhuang have not yet started work.

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 5th Dispatch] The repatriation of Japanese residents in Jinan was fully completed last week. However, among the technical personnel approved by the government to continue residing here, non-technical personnel who used their background relationships to remain under the guise of technicality to protect their private property account for two-thirds of the number. The general public expresses deep dissatisfaction with this and is working hard to urge the government to pay attention.

### Wedemeyer Passes Through Hawaii; Discusses the China Problem with Reporters; Flies to San Francisco Last Night

[United Press, Ford Shafter, Hawaii, 6th Dispatch] General Wedemeyer, the commander of U.S. forces in the China theater, passed through here on his return to the United States from Chongqing and is scheduled to fly to San Francisco on the evening of the 6th. Before his departure, he told reporters that China's most pressing problem is the merger of the Communist and Central armies. If the Chinese Communist Party still possesses an army, there is no hope for lasting peace and democracy. The situation in China currently seems to be improving, and it is hoped that this good situation can be maintained. Special Envoy Marshall has done his best in China. It is said that the current conflicts in China are all local conflicts and are not large in scale. If Marshall can persuade both the Nationalists and the Communists to abandon the use of force and resolve various issues through conferences, without infringing upon each other for months or even years, then there is still hope for lasting peace, otherwise, war will inevitably break out again, plunging China back into chaos. China has promulgated some laws in view of the abolition of various foreign privileges in China, causing dissatisfaction among American businessmen. American businessmen presented a memorandum to President Chiang, expressing dissatisfaction with the unequal treatment of Chinese and Western businessmen in Shanghai. This situation has now been corrected. I think President Chiang would not allow any discrimination against foreign businessmen because China currently needs foreign aid.

### Gejiu Tin Merchants Petition; Request Opening of Controls

### Undelimited Border between Yunnan and Burma at Kawasan; Burmese Troops Invade on Multiple Routes; Take the Opportunity to Kill Overseas Chinese and Loot Property

[Our Newspaper, Kunming, 5th Dispatch] According to the Kunming Citizen's Daily News on the 4th, Kawasan, in the undelimited border between Yunnan and Burma, originally belonged to our country, but was occupied by the British in the 21st year of the Republic of China. When the Japanese army invaded Burma, the British retreated, and the headquarters of our Expeditionary Force considered the area an important border defense area, so it established the Kawasan Garrison Headquarters. Luo Zhengming, the leader of the branch team, led more than a thousand troops and drove the Japanese army back after several bloody battles. Last year, the department was ordered to be abolished and reorganized into the Southern District People's Self-Defense Branch Team. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the branch team was again ordered to withdraw and disband, and the nearby Burmese army took the opportunity to kill thirteen of our merchants, including Liao Kailiang, and loot property worth approximately 30 million national currency. Later, they cruelly killed the overseas Chinese leader Lin Guochu and his son in Zhongnong. They also want to use terrorist means to scare away the Han Chinese in Changdi. Recently, several hundred Burmese troops opened the Kawasan, using foreign missionaries Yong Hengle to threaten and entice about a thousand Kawa people in Banyang Jinzhong and other areas, armed them, and used the chieftain of Xisuoka as a guide, attacking our Nankang Wuxin and other places on multiple routes. After several days of fierce fighting, our self-defense team retreated to Yunsi to concentrate and wait for support due to the disparity in numbers. In this battle, more than fifty enemies were killed.

The discussions lasted for two and a half hours and were conducted in a harmonious atmosphere.

### U.S. Proposes Foreign Ministers Conference: Byrnes Invites Britain, the Soviet Union, and France to Participate; Scheduled to be Held in Paris on the 25th

[Our Newspaper Report] London, 6th Broadcast: U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes has suggested holding a meeting of the foreign ministers of the four major powers. Britain has expressed its approval, but the Soviet Union and France have not yet replied.

[Associated Press, Washington, 5th] The State Department announced today: Secretary of State Byrnes yesterday invited Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, British Foreign Secretary Bevin, and French Foreign Minister Bidault to hold a four-power foreign ministers' meeting in Paris on the 25th of this month in order to complete the peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland as soon as possible. The progress of the four foreign ministers' representatives in London in drafting the peace treaties is slow, which is very worrying, it is said.

[Associated Press, Paris, 5th] The French cabinet today reiterated its demand for international co-management of the Ruhr. It is reported that Foreign Minister Bidault had a conflict of opinion with President Gouin on the issue of western Germany. Gouin opposed the dismemberment of Germany. This declaration clearly shows that Bidault has won a victory.

[United Press, London, 5th] A British Foreign Office spokesman admitted today that the Paris Peace Conference, scheduled to be held on May 1st, may need to be postponed because the four powers have different opinions on the draft peace treaties.

### Soviet Troops Retreating from Iran: Iranian Right Wing Expresses Pessimism About the Soviet-Iranian Agreement; Soviets Do Not Allow British Parliamentarians to Enter Azerbaijan for Inspection

[Our Newspaper Report] London, 6th Broadcast: Iranian right-wing elements are pessimistic about the new Soviet-Iranian agreement. They believe that the agreement has accepted all the Soviet Union's demands, for the following reasons: (1) Although the Soviet Union did not directly exert pressure on Iran, the Red Army's presence on the border was a form of pressure to facilitate the new agreement. (2) Iranian law stipulates that the cession of the Sha-Tan area cannot be negotiated before the Red Army withdraws. (3) Azerbaijan is purely an internal matter and should not be included in the agreement.

[United Press, Tehran, 6th] Amid the tense Soviet-Iranian dispute, the British Parliament sent two members to Iran to observe the actual situation. At present, they have given up trying to enter Azerbaijan because the Soviet side has adopted a consistent approach, not allowing any journalists to enter the province. These two British parliamentarians cannot be an exception, so they will leave Iran on April 10th and return to their country.

[Associated Press, Tehran, 5th] Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Firouz announced today that the direct negotiations between the Soviet Union and Iran in Tehran and Moscow have resolved all outstanding issues on the basis of complete reciprocity and goodwill.

### Truman Speech on U.S. Army Day: The Purpose of Diplomatic Policy is to Prevent Aggression; Recognize British and Soviet Interests in the Far East; Britain and the Soviet Union Should Respect U.S. Intentions

[Associated Press, Chicago, 6th] President Truman, in a speech at the Army Day event at the Soldier Field here today, stated that the purpose of U.S. foreign policy is to prevent oppression and aggression against smaller countries, advocating that the U.S. should maintain a strong reserve army in peacetime. The relationship between the U.S. and other countries, no matter how far these countries are from the U.S. mainland, should be based on a universal policy. The U.S. recognizes that Britain and the Soviet Union have "significant interests" in the Far East, and these countries should also respect the U.S.'s intention to achieve peace and security in the Far East. It is hoped that Britain and the Soviet Union can also align with the U.S. in the pursuit of peace. The United Nations organization has the right to insist on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of countries in the Near East and the Middle East and cannot allow them to be threatened by oppression and aggression. In these countries, hostile external forces may conflict. The U.S. hopes that disputes between colonial powers and colonized peoples everywhere can be resolved peacefully. If the Security Council of the United Nations organization truly respects the "legitimate hopes and demands" of member states, then no matter how different the countries are in their ideas, traditions, and interests, there will be "sufficient power" to resolve the disputes that arise between them. The U.S. is willing to unite with other countries in the Americas to conclude alliances and jointly prevent external attacks. The current goal of the U.S. is to fully support the United Nations organization. The U.S. is prepared to establish a world trade system and provide necessary assistance to consolidate and guarantee world peace. Reform and control of Japan is only the first step in U.S. Far East policy. What we hope is to quickly restore the Far East economy and international trade. To achieve this goal, the U.S. is willing to lend and provide technical assistance to various countries. Congress should approve the U.S. loan to Britain. Atomic energy is the "greatest threat" left by this war. We should control atomic energy so that it benefits humanity and does not destroy it.

### Jiang Tingfu Issues an Appeal: Please Americans Stop Eating Rice, So That Our Country Can Have Surplus Rice to Alleviate the Disaster; The Food Committee's Allocation of Rice to Our Country is Unfair

[Associated Press, Washington, 5th] Jiang Tingfu, Director of the Chinese Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, today, through U.S. Acting Secretary of State Acheson, appealed to Americans to stop eating rice so that China can have more surplus rice. It is said that rice is not the usual food of Americans, and a small reduction in consumption here is enough to alleviate the food shortage in China. Jiang also told reporters that the United Food Committee's allocation of rice to China is very unfair. For example, in the first quarter of this year, of the 160,000 tons of rice from Siam (Thailand), China was only allocated 16,000 tons.

The world already has an organization to maintain peace and must have an organization to maintain life. The conference passed a resolution calling on all countries to reduce the grain used to make bread as much as possible, prevent waste, and step up the elimination of rats and insects that damage shells.

[Our Newspaper Report] London, 6th Broadcast: Hoover left Britain this afternoon and will visit the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Austria, Yugoslavia, and Greece, and then go to India.

Weekly Forum

### The Trend of the Anglo-French Alliance and the Future of the Paris Peace Conference

— Chǔ Yùkūn

The restoration of the Anglo-French alliance has progressed from gestation to a mature stage. First, the French interim president and Prime Minister Gouin delivered a speech, clarifying France's foreign policy, stating, "France must find a way to establish an Anglo-French alliance as a supplement to the Franco-Soviet alliance. If this alliance treaty could further lead to the conclusion of a three-power treaty, that would be even more beneficial." Subsequently, the French Socialist Party held a general assembly, also expressing support for President Gouin's proposal to immediately restore the Anglo-French alliance, and in its message to the French people, it stated: "France should sign a treaty with Britain of the same nature as the Franco-Soviet alliance treaty, in order to enhance political and economic cooperation between the peoples of Britain and France." On the British side, this immediately resonated, welcoming the realization of the Anglo-French alliance. Therefore, Foreign Secretary Bevin also announced in the House of Commons that the British government has always been willing to maintain close relations with France, and believes that Anglo-French relations can be greatly enhanced at the appropriate time by signing a treaty similar in nature to the Franco-Soviet alliance treaty, so this treaty is a guarantee against further aggression." Since Britain and France are so aligned in their thinking, the restoration of the Anglo-French alliance should not be difficult to achieve, it goes without saying. Moreover, there are external reports that Foreign Secretary Bevin will visit France, so everyone speculates that the Anglo-French alliance may be realized as early as within April, or at the latest by the eve of the opening of the Paris Peace Conference on May 1st, the alliance treaty may be signed in Paris.

The Anglo-French alliance was originally a traditional relationship between the two countries. Before the First World War, Britain and France formed the Entente Cordiale on the condition of mutual concessions and mutual compromises; later, during the First World War, they fought side by side, weathering storms together, and finally achieved the final victory. After the end of the war, because the interests of Britain and France failed to converge in many cases, their steps diverged. France attempted to dominate the European continent, while Britain's European policy was based on "balance of power," and they gradually could not cooperate effectively. However, the division between Britain and France only benefited third parties. Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy seized the opportunity to rise, deliberately engaging in aggression, plunging the entire Europe into the threat of war, almost creating a situation where there was a constant state of panic. Later, Britain and France saw the European political situation becoming more and more serious, and they began to bury the hatchet and resume friendly relations, emphasizing the traditional relationship of the Anglo-French alliance, and adopted a common and unified anti-aggression policy. Although it was somewhat late, they were able to declare war on Germany at the same time and in the same way, which was ultimately a wise move. But unfortunately, France staged a major tragedy of the era in the Second World War. As the leader of the European allies, it resisted the German invasion, but collapsed in less than a month, and bowed to Hitler, allowing him to slaughter it! Fortunately, the patriotic General de Gaulle rose up and led the resistance movement, and organized a French government in exile in London. Thanks to the assistance of Britain, and further supported by the United States, its momentum grew, and it finally reversed France's misfortune, and was still one of the five powers after the war.

From this, we can see the close relationship between Britain and France. But why hasn't a formal alliance treaty been signed to this day after this World War? And what is most surprising is that the Franco-Soviet alliance treaty and the Anglo-Soviet friendship treaty have both been established, but only the Anglo-French alliance treaty has not been signed. What is the reason? According to our analysis, Britain and France still hold different views on certain European issues after the war: the most obvious are: (1) The Spanish issue. France believes that the existence of the Franco regime is enough to endanger world peace, so it demands that this issue be submitted to the United Nations Security Council for handling. But Britain only opposes the Franco regime in principle, but does not advocate interfering in Spain's internal affairs, and with the support of the United States, France's wishes cannot be realized for the time being. (2) Regarding the western border issue of Germany, France firmly insists on separating the Ruhr area and the Rhineland from Germany, especially to supply the coal produced in the Ruhr area to France. Former Prime Minister Blum of the Popular Front cabinet went to the United States to visit, and its main purpose was to make the United States and the public support France's proposal. Britain, on the other hand, believes that the disposal of defeated Germany should be discussed and resolved jointly by the Allied powers. (3) The Near East issue is also a place where British and French opinions differ. But recently, Britain and France have both agreed to withdraw their troops from Lebanon and Syria. Britain implemented this first, and France also fulfilled its pledge as scheduled, so there are generally no problems.

Since there are still these issues to be resolved between Britain and France, General de Gaulle insisted that all outstanding issues between the two countries must be resolved before signing the alliance treaty, as the basis for the Anglo-French alliance treaty. But Britain hopes that France will first sign a general treaty, using explicit provisions to specify various goals, so that other issues will be easily resolved. This is where the opinions of Britain and France differ, and it is also the reason why the Anglo-French alliance treaty has been delayed in being signed. However, the international developments in the past month have made both Britain and France feel the need to restore the alliance treaty as soon as possible. From France's point of view, although France has a treaty of friendship and alliance with the Soviet Union, it still feels isolated in Europe, especially feeling great anxiety about how to deal with the resurgence of German aggression. Moreover, from the Nordic countries, all the Baltic Sea coastal countries and the Balkan Peninsula countries are under Soviet control, so the balance between the United States and the Soviet Union has been lost. In any case, France and the Soviet Union can no longer be in an equal position as before the war. Therefore, France very much hopes that the Anglo-French alliance will be realized as soon as possible, so that the Franco-Soviet, Anglo-Soviet, and Anglo-French treaties can be transformed into a three-power treaty, so that France can be secure. On the British side, seeing the excessive expansion of Soviet power on the European continent, and the tacit establishment of an Eastern European bloc, Britain, in order to maintain the balance of power in Europe, has to win over France and conclude an alliance, and then ask the remaining Western European countries such as the Netherlands and Belgium to participate, so that a Western European bloc is formed invisibly, which can compete with the Soviet-led Eastern European bloc. Now that France has taken the initiative to propose the Anglo-French alliance, Britain is naturally happy to see it succeed.

Therefore, the conclusion of an alliance treaty by Britain and France before the opening of the peace conference has a very close relationship with the European political situation and the future of the peace conference. From a pessimistic perspective, it is a serious question whether the Soviet Union, seeing the Anglo-French alliance, can avoid regarding it as the predecessor of a Western European bloc. At that time, if the Soviet Union's attitude towards France inevitably changes, then in the peace conference, the Soviet Union may adopt an uncompromising attitude. Therefore, we are really not overly optimistic about the peace conference held in Paris on May 1st. The foreign ministers' meeting has already failed, and the Soviet Union is unwilling to let go of its interests in the Balkan Peninsula. How can we hope that this meeting will produce concrete results? On the other hand, from an optimistic perspective, if Anglo-Soviet relations can improve, and the Soviet Union can fully understand the Anglo-French alliance, and is willing to expand this alliance treaty into a three-power treaty, then the Anglo-French alliance will definitely make many contributions to world peace, and the Paris Peace Conference can proceed smoothly.

[Our Paper] At 2:55 PM yesterday, a tragic accident occurred at the intersection of Avenue Albert and Rue Henri, when a car drove onto the sidewalk and ran over three male and female pedestrians. It turned out that Shi Hongxu, a section member of the Inspection Section of the Public Works Bureau, residing at No. 31, Jingu Village, Rue Père Froc, was driving a self-provided public car (certificate No. 16001) and was driving north along the street. At the same time, a red public bus of the French Concession No. 22 was driving south. The two cars were speeding towards each other and almost collided. Fortunately, they immediately braked and avoided each other, avoiding a major disaster. However, in the moment of Shi's avoidance, the car suddenly drove onto the sidewalk, causing three male and female pedestrians to be run over. One of the women, in the end, died of her injuries at 5:50 PM. The names of the three people who were killed and injured are listed below: (1) An Italian, Enchil, suffered minor injuries to his hands and feet. (2) A houseboy, He Afu, suffered a head injury.

### Liao Di Xin Escorted to Suzhou

Recruiting Troops with Malicious Intent

[Our Newspaper] Liao Di Xin, who successively served as a Lieutenant General Staff Officer in the Military Commission of the puppet regime and as Commander of the Fourth Column of the Zhejiang Coastal Defense Headquarters, went into hiding in Sijiao after his misdeeds were revealed. He dispatched his followers to sneak into Nanjing and Shanghai, specifically to recruit vagrant soldiers and scattered troops, plotting illicit activities. The Shanghai Garrison Headquarters arrested Liao in the middle of last month at his "Shanghai Office" located at No. 5 Anning Road, Wujin Road, and subsequently apprehended more than sixty accomplices. After this case was exposed by this newspaper, the Procuratorate of the Capital District Court immediately sent a telegram stating, "This office is currently investigating the case of Zhang Zhongding, of the puppet organization's court, privately recruiting troops, and the original files show that the defendant was instructed by Liao Di Xin to recruit troops and serve the puppet government. At that time, Liao Di Xin also had the crime of jointly plotting and instigating anti-Japanese troops to desert and join the puppet government for peace movement. This office has attempted to arrest him but failed. Currently, the case file has been submitted to the superior procurator for review. Please escort Liao promptly to the Jiangsu High Court Procuratorate for further investigation and prosecution." Yesterday, it was learned that General Commander Li has approved the escort of Liao to the Suzhou High Court Procuratorate for interrogation and prosecution.

### After Foreign Orders Arrive, Paper Prices Expected to Decline, Enemy and Puppet Paper Products Being Processed for Sale

[Our Newspaper] A reporter recently inquired about the paper shortage with the person in charge of the China Paper Industry Company, who stated: Although the stock of various types of paper in the city is not abundant, the market price is trending downward due to the influence of foreign paper orders and the disposal of enemy and puppet paper products by the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau. It is claimed that the current low price of foreign orders is three to four times lower than the price in the city, which is not uncommon. When the foreign orders arrive one after another in the future, the paper price in the city will gradually decline. In addition, all the enemy and puppet paper products received by the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau have been handed over to the company for processing and sale. However, the received paper products are scattered in more than one hundred warehouses. It is now planned to concentrate these scattered paper products in a small number of warehouses for processing. The transportation has started on March 10th. By the end of March, the paper in more than 20 warehouses has been transported and concentrated, and it has been sold to the paper industry and various cultural institutions at a price that is 10% to 20% lower than the market price. The disposal will continue in the future to achieve the goal of stable and low prices.

### U.S. Aviation Industry Giant, Panton, Arrives in Shanghai

Inspects Aviation Business in the Far East

[Our Newspaper] Panton, the chief engineer of the Douglas Aircraft Company, recently flew to Shanghai from the United States to inspect the aviation situation in the Far East. In an interview, he stated that China's need for aviation is greater than that of any other country in the world. When discussing the new trends in the aircraft manufacturing industry, Panton said that the most important issue for manufacturers at present is how to reduce the production cost of aircraft so that the general public can enjoy the convenience of air transportation. This is especially true in China because China has vast land and little railway transportation, so it is necessary to develop air transportation to make up for the deficiency.

### Senators Questioned the City's Budget and Final Accounts at the Ninth General Assembly Yesterday, Hoping to Prevent Tax Leakage and Ensure All Revenue Goes to the Public; Requests to Improve Flower Tax, Only Small Denomination Tickets Available

[Our Newspaper] The Provisional Municipal Council of this city held its ninth general assembly at 9:20 yesterday morning. Thirty-four councilors attended. Pu Zhengdong, Director of the Finance Bureau, reported on the financial situation:

Finance Bureau Report

Past Finances: According to the fiscal year 1936, the income of the old Municipal Government was 10,320,000 yuan, and the expenditure was 11,060,000 yuan. The income of the former British Public Works Department was 23,651,710 yuan, and the expenditure was 27,545,391 yuan. The income of the former French Concession Bureau was 9,759,406 yuan, and the expenditure was 11,687,741 yuan. Receiving Puppet Regime Assets: Office supplies, securities, and cash have all been reported to the municipal government and then to the central government for safekeeping or resolution. Securities and cash include: various frozen drafts, various valuable securities and bank deposits of the puppet Welfare Committee, valuable securities of the former Public Works Department, 200,000 shares of Shanghai Hengchan Co., Ltd. stock, 5,263 shares of various government bonds, and cash amounting to 18,236,837,884 yuan in puppet currency. Tax Revenue Items: Banquet tax is 20%, entertainment tax is 50%, house tax is collected at 14% of the land value set in 1937, plus 60 times. Business license tax is 0.5% of the current capital value, or 0.25% of the total annual turnover if the capital value cannot be calculated. Vehicle license tax is calculated according to the type and carrying capacity of the vehicle. Slaughter tax is 5%. Hotel tax is 20%. A total of 415 houses that have been inspected and re-leased, and 50 houses in Pudong. A total of 127,754,876,24 yuan in public debt from the old municipal government, the British and French Public Works Bureau, and the puppet organizations have been inspected. The Finance Bureau's income from September of last year to February of this year totaled 3,315,137,423 yuan, while the expenditure was 7,352,632,663 yuan. The Municipal Government General Affairs Office accounted for 9.24%, the Accounting Office 1.36%, the Civil Affairs Office 2.95%, the Police Bureau 32.03%, the Finance Bureau 3.61%, the Education Bureau 7.84%, the Public Utilities Bureau 6.87%, the Public Works Bureau 14.29%, the Health Bureau 10.51%, the Social Affairs Bureau 1.88%, the Land Bureau 4.67%, and others accounted for 4.175%. Plans to Overcome Current Difficulties: (1) Determine the total budget of revenue and expenditure, reduce or stop unnecessary expenditures; (2) Urge the Central Government to clear the various arrears that should be allocated after the recovery; (3) Implement the newly established financial revenue and expenditure system as soon as possible; (4) Request the allocation of enemy and puppet property to expedite urgent construction; (5) Clear up public funds and properties, and establish a special management agency; (6) Continue to rectify tax donations and cultivate tax personnel; (7) Implement local inheritance and carry out labor services; (8) Regulate the market and support industry and commerce. After Director Pu's report, before asking questions, Feng Youzhen made a temporary motion, saying that the Congress was about to open and should issue a declaration on the proceedings. He proposed the formation of a drafting committee composed of Xu Yongzuo, Feng Youzhen, Chuan Tongxian, Chen Xunyu, and Pan Xulun, which was unanimously approved.

Inquiries from Councilors

Zhan Wenhua inquired: (1) The municipal government plans to request the receipt of a portion of enemy and puppet materials for construction purposes. Why not request that a portion of the proceeds from the auction of enemy assets by the Enemy Property Management Bureau be used to enrich the municipal treasury? Can the municipal government's budget be made public? (2) What are the plans for issuing municipal government bonds? Xu Yongzuo also requested that the budget situation after the end of February be announced. According to the organizational regulations of the Municipal Provisional Council, the most important task of the councilors is to resolve the budget and review the final accounts. Pan Xulun's review report found that the expenditure of the Education Bureau accounted for 7.84%, which was too little, and the Public Works Bureau accounted for 14.29%, which should also be greatly increased, while the general affairs expenses accounted for 9.24% and the public utilities bureau accounted for 6.87%, which seemed too much. The business license tax has the effect of hindering the development of businesses by citizens and should be abolished. Cao Jun said that although the Finance Bureau said it was making every effort to prevent tax leakage, according to the report, the slaughter tax alone had many discrepancies. He hoped to further ensure that all revenue goes to the public and strictly prohibit tax collectors from engaging in corruption. Yong Xiangyun pointed out that only large denomination flower tax stamps are sold on the market, which wastes paper and time. Can large denomination tickets be issued? Ji Hao advocated minimizing the organization of the defense corps to reduce the burden on citizens. Feng Youzhen believes that it is worth considering whether provisional councilors have the right to review the final accounts and budget.

Director Pu's Reply

Director Pu replied to various points: (1) There are plans to allocate the proceeds from the sale of enemy and puppet materials to the municipal treasury. (2) It is difficult to issue government bonds at the current high interest rates, so they cannot be issued for the time being. (3) The budget was prepared last year, but there are many discrepancies between the calculation and the current situation, and it has not yet been approved by the central government, so it has not been released. Compensation funds are allocated by the central government in installments. (4) The purpose of the business license tax is to crack down on and reduce luxury businesses. It is set by the central government and is being requested from the Ministry of Finance for approval. The slaughter tax has not been adjusted for half a year, so there are naturally discrepancies. The meeting adjourned at 11:45.

Tenth General Assembly Discusses Proposals

The report from the various bureaus of the Municipal Government to the Provisional Municipal Council of the city was completed yesterday morning. The tenth general assembly was held at 3:15 p.m. The assembly reviewed the proposals as a whole. Twenty-eight councilors attended. Councilor Yu Zhijing has registered, and Councilor Li Denghui has resigned, and Councilor Xu Guomao has been re-elected and has also registered. Speaker Xu Jiqing first presented the report of the third review committee on education and culture, and requested a resolution from the assembly. As a result, the following were passed: (1) All agencies and troops occupying school buildings should be ordered to move out immediately; (2) Sufficient funds should be allocated to subsidize private schools; (3) The Education Bureau should be requested to use the existing school buildings and equipment of municipal primary and secondary schools in the city to establish ordinary and vocational supplementary schools at all levels; (4) Primary school education should focus on Chinese, and English should be a non-essential subject. Lu Sitan proposed to change "English" to "Foreign Language" and other proposals. The second review committee submitted proposals for review on finance, economy, and construction, which were passed: (1) The Central Government should be recommended by this council to quickly enact and promulgate the "Urban Housing Lease Management Regulations" to regulate urban housing leases and reduce disputes and difficulties. (2) In the name of this council, a telegram should be sent to the Central Government requesting that a portion of the income from the disposal of enemy and puppet properties within the Shanghai urban area be allocated to Shanghai as funds for local reconstruction and construction. (3) The Municipal Government should be requested to construct a Pujiang tunnel to facilitate transportation on the west bank of the Huangpu River. (4) The enemy property wharf and warehouse in this city should be requested by the Executive Yuan to be transferred to the Shanghai Municipal Government for takeover. (5) Speculation should be curbed, investment should be guided, and the social economy should be stabilized. It is advocated that the resumption of the stock exchange should be approved first. (6) The Central Government should be requested to expedite the start of work on the enemy and puppet factories that have been taken over, and to encourage private factories to resume work, so as to accommodate unemployed workers and increase production. (7) The Municipal Government should be requested to actively develop the suburbs. (8) The Municipal Government should be requested to work with the Garrison Headquarters to quickly investigate occupied houses and fairly allocate them for residence to solve the most serious housing shortage in this city. (9) The Mayor submitted a proposal that the municipal treasury is extremely stretched, and it is planned to continue collecting hotel taxes. The meeting adjourned at 6:30 p.m. Other proposals that have not been resolved will be discussed at the next general assembly.

The drafting committee of the closing declaration of the Municipal Provisional Council, Chen Xunyu, Feng Youzhen, and others, will discuss the drafting matters next Monday. The first review committee appointed Shen Chunhui and Wang Genzhong as representatives, the second committee appointed Xu Yongzuo and Xu Shihao as representatives, and the third committee appointed Feng Youzhen and He Bingsong.

Citizens' Opinions Received, Can Be Classified into Six Categories

[Our Newspaper] Since the opening of the Provisional Municipal Council of this city, 43 opinions from citizens have been received, totaling 62 items. After sorting, they can be classified as follows: (1) Housing rentals: 9 items, most of which raised the unreasonableness of using gold bars to top up housing prices, the illegal exploitation of residents by sublessors, and the arbitrary manipulation of rents, but the fundamental key is to solve the housing shortage; (2) Industry and Commerce: 14 items: 1. Propose to assess rice prices and allocate food; 2. Crack down on illegal speculation and ensure normal investment; 3. Reduce banquet donations, and exempt daily food from donations; 4. Thoroughly eliminate the strike and go-slow trend; 5. Suggest that the government adopt "economic policies"; 6. Pay attention to private shops and check account books, etc.; (3) Health: 8 items: 1. Clear up garbage in alleys and dredge sewers; 2. Add public toilets and trash cans; 3. Crack down on night soil collectors, pay attention to extortion, and prevent embezzlement; 4. Please build clinics in Zhabei and Nanshi, etc.; (4) Public Utilities: 7 items: 1. Adjust the route stops and times of public buses in Nanshi; 2. Correct the methods for renewing bicycle licenses; 3. Recover transportation tools operated by foreign merchants, and connect the trams of the former two concessions; 4. Add street lights in alleys (especially in Nanshi); 5. Open the closed water taps in western Shanghai, etc.; (5) Civil Administration and Police: 9 items: 1. Abolish and investigate the puppet Baojia chiefs; 2. Crack down on dance halls; 3. Improve the quality and treatment of police officers; 4. Thoroughly abolish the prostitution system, etc.; (6) Others: 15 items: 1. Cut down the number of officials in various municipal government agencies and those who held puppet positions; 2. Crack down on sequential cartoons and fortune-telling stalls; 3.

Use Guild Organizations to Handle Enemy and Puppet Materials

Luo Qinghua proposed that although the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau has a very small number of industrial and commercial figures participating in the review committee, it only knows how to trust the Sanwu Department Store for handling materials, and has never known how to use the organizational strength of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and various industry guilds, which has led to protracted delays and increasing confusion, which is regrettable. To this day, not only is the loss of materials painful, but the warehouses have been sealed for a long time, resulting in the relief supplies transported to Shanghai by the Relief Administration, and the export of inland tea cocoons and other local products in the near future, all having nowhere to store. Therefore, it is imperative to dispose of and receive materials and clear the sealed warehouses. The only way to change the plan is to use the organizations of various industries to coordinate the processing. Therefore, it is proposed that the government quickly take the following emergency measures: 1. Order the warehouse industry and customs declaration industry to send personnel to cooperate with the customs and the commodity inspection bureau to conduct a time-limited inventory of the materials sealed in each warehouse, classify them, create a roster, and announce the quantity. 2. Expand the organization of the review committee, recruit impartial people from important industries to serve as members, and re-examine and revise the processing methods. 3. The review committee should classify the sealed materials, discuss and determine the processing methods, and estimate the minimum and maximum prices for announcement at any time. 4. The materials should be classified and handed over to the respective industry associations, and the time limit for selling the sealed materials should be set. The legitimate profits of the distributors should be verified, and price increases and manipulation should not be allowed, and non-industry people should be prevented from hoarding. 5. If it is an industrial raw material, the manufacturer in this industry has the right to preferentially purchase it, and it is stipulated that deferred payment and other methods can be applied. 6. The review committee should discuss and set a deadline for the classification and clearance. If the sale is not completed by the deadline, the estimated price will be reduced, or the goods will be auctioned publicly, and the deadline will be ended. If there are still inferior products that cannot be sold by the deadline, they will be handed over to the municipal government for management. Another proposal by Shi is to commemorate the late U.S. President Roosevelt. It is proposed that the government change the racecourse on Nanjing West Road in this city into Roosevelt Park and erect a monument to show respect and lasting memory.

### Administrative Yuan Must Approve Housing Needs of Various Agencies, Review Committee for the Disposal of Enemy and Puppet Properties Passed Yesterday

The Review Committee for the Disposal of Enemy and Puppet Properties in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Areas passed the resolution yesterday: To seize enemy and puppet real estate and sell it quickly as ordered, all agencies and groups that need real estate must directly submit their requests to the Administrative Yuan for approval. In the past, the resolutions of the Real Estate Application Committee of the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau to allocate or lease real estate to various agencies and groups were temporary. Once the real estate is sold by bid, the leased agencies and groups must move out.

### Scalping Tickets of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company

Owner and Staff of Ticket Agency Detained

[Our Newspaper] In order to eliminate scalping, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company requires passengers to sign in person when purchasing tickets for each route. Tickets to Qingdao, Tianjin, Taiwan, Guangdong, etc. also require photos to prevent resale. However, letters of introduction or reservations from various agencies continue to pour in, and the passenger ticket department can hardly cope with them. It is reported that the last voyage of the Zhoushan Wheel to Ningbo was announced to be full. Ma, an employee of the transportation team of a certain agency, used his official position to purchase five tickets for the Zhoushan Wheel from the passenger transportation department of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and sold them to a small ticket agency for resale to passengers at black market prices. The external affairs team of the agency seized the incident and reported it to the authorities, who transferred it to the military police team for thorough investigation. The team detained the female owner and staff of the ticket agency for interrogation. The ticket agency then asked Ma for help. Ma admitted to being an employee of a certain agency and went to the military police team to bail out the detained female owner of the ticket agency. The military police team had already detected that Ma was also a criminal and was about to arrest him. He was detained for investigation and will be transferred to the court for prosecution. It is reported that the agency will not sell tickets to anyone who does not come to the agency in person to purchase them in the future.

They planned to cross the river to Pudong first and stay overnight, and then take a bus to Suzhou to start a small family. The patrol class found their expressions flustered and suspicious and took them to the branch for questioning. According to Zhao and Yin, they met the young and beautiful girls at the Yangjiadu Temple Fair two days ago. They were all of secondary school education and fell in love at first sight. They planned to go to Suzhou together, rent a house first, and then start a business to make a living permanently. All four girls covered their faces and cried silently.

### Bulls Continue to Push Upward, Public Bonds Still Rising, Chinese and Foreign Stocks Both Fall

After falling, public bonds were pulled up again. Class C bonds initially opened around 4300 yuan, falling to 4150 yuan mid-session. After large investors sold, they aggressively bought, driving the price up to 4600 yuan, then hovered. Bullish activity remained strong, with a firm process. At noon, it hovered around 4550 yuan, up 550 yuan from the previous close. Miscellaneous bonds traded poorly and were the weakest. Classes A, B, and E each rose 250 yuan, while Class D only rose 100 yuan. The Chinese stock market was uncertain. Although there was a bullish trend mid-session, it was difficult to reach new highs. After several days of consecutive gains, the competition between bulls and bears gradually reached equilibrium. The market opened lower this morning, following the previous night's trend. Bulls bought on the dip. Mid-session, Wing On Textiles rose to 5500 yuan, Meiya to 4400 yuan, and King Fook to 450 yuan, then hovered without further gains. Wing On Textiles fell to 5000 yuan, Meiya to 4080 yuan, and King Fook below 220 yuan. Money was unusually loose, with even more excess funds in Sichuan banks. At noon, the market stabilized, resulting in a decline of between half and one-tenth compared to the previous close. Foreign stocks continued to fall. Except for Ken Zhi, which saw more buyers due to the initial activity, the rest fell upon opening. The market was weakest mid-session. At noon, it stabilized slightly, resulting in a further decrease of half to over one-tenth compared to the previous close. Ken Zhi rose again by a strong half.

### Calm in the Gold Market

The gold market was very calm yesterday. It opened steadily this morning, with no activity. Although the supply was small, it still gradually decreased to 1.455 million. The Bank of China's allocation price remained unchanged, having no impact. Afterwards, funds were loose and abundant. Investors took profits on dips. At noon, it recovered slightly after falling. The afternoon was also stable. The result was similar to the previous close. The listed price for decorative gold was also stable, remaining at 160,000 yuan. Silver was 1600, silver dollars were weak, and unofficial interest rates were slightly lower due to tighter speculative outlets, ranging from 0.13 to 0.18 yuan.

### Stagnant U.S. Dollars, Stable Hong Kong Dollars

### U.S. Export-Import Bank Grants Five Loans to China

To Assist China in Restoring Production

[Reuters Washington, 6th] Regarding the five loans from the Export-Import Bank to China, according to the bank's chairman, Martin: The purpose of these loans is to promote the construction of China's transportation and electricity systems, and will only be used to restore damaged equipment, not to expand new equipment. The loans will help China restore foreign trade.

### Grass Green Woolen Fabrics are Strong

Grass green broadcloth and gabardine have recently been popular in the market, with firm retail and wholesale prices. This is because the official goods circulating in the market are very scarce. The limited goods received from enemy property seizures have also been gradually distributed and are mostly silk thread and rayon. Like No. 500, they were all re-dyed dark blue by the China Textile Company and distributed. This has led to a shortage of grass green broadcloth and woolen fabrics, making them strong. The continuous purchases by merchants from Nanjing, Anqing, Wuhu, and Hangzhou are also a major reason.

### Neither Yarn nor Cotton Show Improvement

The yarn market still lacked progress yesterday due to sluggish sales. Only a small number of merchants from Beijing and Wuhu bought a few dozen pieces of 20-count small yarn. Merchants from Hunan and Hubei have been inactive since the beginning of this month, and merchants from Guangdong are also slow to purchase. Therefore, market transactions are very rare and lifeless. The price of each yarn has fallen by another 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. It is said that major yarn mills are willing to sell, but there are few buyers. Judging from the current yarn market, it will be difficult to improve without large purchases from merchants. Yesterday, the Spinning and Construction Company began selling 18 types of woolen fabric, 2 types of blankets, and 4 types of sewing thread.

Yesterday, New York cotton prices rose by 8 to 18 points, with some mid-term prices rising by 24 points. Near-term prices were US$28.04, and far-term prices were US$28.24, showing a pattern of lower near-term prices and higher far-term prices. Spot price of middling cotton was US$28.63. Spot cotton transactions in this city were still good, but the market was constrained by the lack of improvement in yarn and cloth. The market value was lowered by about one or two thousand yuan.

### Sugar Standards Not Passed

Yesterday, the association held another auction for sugar. A total of 3,000 bags of raw sand red sugar, priced at 47,000 yuan, and 1,200 bags of white sugar in three and a half cars, priced at 72,000 yuan, were sold. Only a few hundred bags were sold, failing to sell out. The listing price for high-quality green sugar was a few dozen bags at 51,500 yuan. Merchants from Shantou offered 55,000 yuan for high-quality green sugar and 70,000 yuan for high-quality rock sugar, but no transactions were made. The trend is flat and weak.

### Seafood Market Opens with Declining Prices

Seafood prices have been softening recently and have not yet turned around. Yesterday, the listings in the southern market showed the price of Jian Yao dried scallops at 135,000 yuan, followed by 128,000 yuan to 115,000 yuan. Fujian flower mushrooms were 845,000 yuan to 827,000 yuan, and lower-grade dried scallops were only 785,000 yuan. Jian Yao mushrooms were 440,000 yuan, all showing declines compared to previous prices.

### Selling Pressure Envelops the Coal Market

Coal market transactions are sparse, and the downward trend is difficult to reverse. In terms of prices, except for white coal lumps, which were previously in short supply and had high prices, they are now continuing to decline. For other types of coal, such as bituminous coal and white coal dust, although the prices have not continued to decline, the overall market sentiment is unusually weak. This is because there are many sellers and few buyers, so the market is unable to rally.

### Construction Hardware Declines

Asphalt and Oil Felt Are More Popular Than Before

Recently, construction hardware prices have been fluctuating, with more declines than gains overall. Prices for galvanized iron, cement, and ribbed steel bars are all lower than before. The price of 3'x6' flat galvanized iron has suffered a major setback due to the dumping of goods from the Jianghai Customs. Since the arrival of Tianjin Horse Brand barrel cement in Shanghai, the cement market has plummeted, severely impacting local factory goods, which have not yet turned around. There are still ample inventories of ribbed steel bars, but actual sales are not satisfactory, causing the market to soften. Other items, such as asphalt and oil felt, are more popular than before, especially U.S. No. 2 oil felt, which is 60% higher than when it first arrived. Because the market inventory of this product is low and actual sales have been strong recently, it is becoming increasingly scarce. The current retail price is 65,000 to 66,000 yuan per roll. Due to the lower supply of asphalt from Texaco and the strong actual sales in this market, the market price has risen. Furthermore, the demand for asphalt in the interior is greater than for roofing felt, so the purchase price is now higher than the selling price.

### Foreign Insurance Companies Given Three Months to Register

[Reported by this newspaper] The Ministry of Finance has issued three regulations regarding the resumption of business by foreign insurance companies, which are becoming increasingly numerous, ordering all provinces and cities to comply: (1) Foreign insurance companies that had branches in China before the war, which were suspended due to the war, and now seek to resume business, must apply for supplementary registration in accordance with the law within three months of the issuance of this order. Failure to do so within the deadline will result in suspension of business. (2) Those that had branches before the war, but only conducted insurance business in the name of agents, and are still operating, must apply for registration in accordance with the law within three months of the issuance of this order. Failure to do so will result in a mandatory suspension of business. (3) All insurance policies issued by foreign insurance companies in China must be in Chinese.

### Canadian Loan Balance to Continue Purchasing Transportation Materials

Of the loans China has received from Canada, transportation materials account for US$20 million. In addition to the already purchased 1 million railroad ties (US$2 million) and 16 ships (US$4 million), an additional purchase of 1,000 kilometers of steel rails and 1,000 sets of rail joints has been requested, valued at US$6.74 million. The remaining balance is US$7.26 million. It has been learned that the Ministry of Communications finalized the plans for continued purchases by the end of March, including railroad ties (US$3 million), ships (US$3 million), and telecommunications materials (US$1.26 million). Efforts will be made to ship these materials as soon as possible.

### Summary of Market Conditions

Longan Fruit: Quanzhou large dried longan fruit is very stable in the market. Yesterday's listings were more numerous, with over 500 baskets being sold at a price of 60,000 yuan, with lower prices for lower quality goods.

Tea: The market is declining and has not yet recovered. Dealers are selectively buying, but transactions are sluggish and unable to improve. Prices are decreasing every day.

Cotton Cloth: The China Textile Company is supplying large quantities for transport to Japan, causing market prices to plummet.

Cotton Textiles: Flat and sluggish, but Dafa bed sheets are slightly firmer.

Silk: Prices for high-grade raw silk remain unchanged, while there are more sellers of medium-grade silk. Labor unrest in silk factories has not been completely resolved, so prices are softening again. Rayon is also following a downward trend. The silk market is flat. Recently, empty shell companies have emerged, targeting Dachong Bi Crepe, dumping large quantities, causing the market to plummet. However, because the market price is too far from the factory price (3700 yuan), the short sellers are facing difficulties.

### British and Australian Efforts to Develop Rayon Industry

Latest Rayon Woolen Fabrics

[British Information Service, London, 5th] Golders Silk Factory is producing a new type of rayon woolen fabric. This is the result of British research on rayon and proves that silk and wool can be combined to weave a new fabric for the foreign market. This new fabric has a wide range of uses. For example, a gray-green tropical suit is woven from silk and wool, and it does not shrink after repeated washing. Another type of fabric made of white silk and brown wool is also durable.

Australia Establishes Rayon Factory

[British Information Service, London, 5th] According to New South Wales Premier McKell, commercial negotiations between the New South Wales government and Golders Silk Factory of England have concluded. Golders Silk Factory will establish a rayon factory in New South Wales, with an estimated cost of 5 million pounds, covering an area of approximately 500 acres, employing 4,000 workers, and planning to hire British experts and staff.

British Factories Spend Huge Sums on Research

Golders Silk Factory is continuing its important research on British rayon and has donated 600,000 pounds to the University of Leeds, specifically for textile students to conduct various research (the University of Leeds' textile department is renowned for its research on the woolen industry). In June 1944, Golders Silk Factory resolved to allocate 500,000 pounds for research on important issues in the rayon industry. The donation to the University of Leeds is the factory's second donation from this research fund to the University of Leeds.

### Japanese Education System Must Be Thoroughly Reformed

Report from the U.S. Education Inspection Team

[United Press, Tokyo, 6th] After a detailed study of the Japanese education system, the U.S. Education Inspection Team today submitted its final report, outlining a comprehensive plan to reform Japanese education. The report stated that in view of the responsibility for Japanese children, Japanese education must be thoroughly reformed. The Japanese language is a major obstacle to student development. Students spend a considerable amount of time learning to write Japanese, which could be used to learn other languages and basic knowledge of skills or science and social conditions. The report also proposed the following reforms: (1) Children under the age of sixteen must attend school, and tuition fees will be subsidized by the government. (2) Train teachers to effectively use teaching materials. (3) Course design and textbook selection must be discussed with teachers. (4) Revise history and geography textbooks, removing mythological portions. (5) Implement moral education to prepare children for future democratic life. (6) Implement health education, focusing on nutrition, health, and public health issues. (7) Maximize opportunities to educate adults. (8) Promote vocational education. (9) Make higher education accessible to the public, not just the privilege of a few. To implement the above plan, educational administration should be decentralized rather than as centralized as it is now. The power of the Ministry of Education should be reduced, and its responsibilities will only be to provide technical assistance and advice to various schools, with little direct control over local schools.

### City Council Receives Citizen's Letter of Opinion, Calls for Ban on Cartoon Strip Stalls

[Special Dispatch from Dagongshe] Cartoon strip stalls line the roads and alley entrances throughout the city, attracting semi-literate, ignorant street children and apprentices. The language in these books is vulgar, and the content is absurd, leading to distorted thinking and indirectly corrupting social morals. Yesterday, the City Council received multiple letters of opinion from citizens, the most striking of which called for the banning of small book stalls (i.e., cartoon strip stalls). It is reported that the City Council attaches great importance to the above suggestion, and the administrative authorities will soon issue a clear prohibition.

### Student Parents Oppose Second Tuition Fee Collection

[Special Dispatch from This City] Since the news of the school collecting a second tuition fee was released, student parents throughout the city have been extremely anxious due to the unbearable burden. Consequently, a group of parents gathered yesterday to discuss the matter. They unanimously agreed that since the people have already fulfilled their tax obligations, their children should have the right to free national education. Paying tuition fees is already an extra burden for the people, so how can they bear to be charged again? Education is the foundation of nation-building, and teacher funding should be planned by the government as a whole. The government must be responsible for improving the lives of teachers and cannot simply exploit the people. Therefore, they unanimously opposed the collection of the second tuition fee and decided to hold a reception for all sectors of society at the Great New Public Company Fellowship Association on Lauer Road at 3:00 PM today to publish a statement to parents throughout the city.

### Looking at New York Through Financial Figures

— New York Airmail Dispatch, March 11, Special Correspondent Zhu Jia Reads

It has been over two months since I came to this great city. If one only observes its superficial prosperity, one cannot truly understand New York. Therefore, today I want to observe it from the perspective of the city's management functions, specifically by exploring the financial budget, the "mother of all administrative affairs," to see what policies their authorities are using to maintain and promote such a situation.

Strangely enough, even in this wealthiest city in the world, where the Wall Street financial center is located, the New York City government still complains about being short of money when budgeting for the entire year. Revenue and expenditure cannot be balanced, and they have no choice but to borrow. The outstanding debt from the past is already considerable, and it seems that this year's difficulties remain, which is the first headache for the new mayor, O'Dwyer. The future solutions are nothing more than subsidies from the state government and increased tax revenue. However, the legislative procedures in the United States are cumbersome, and it is unknown when a resolution can be reached. Now, let's take a look at their revenue and expenditure allocation, which may be useful for our reference.

### Part of the Annual Budget Has No Source of Funds

According to Peter Grimm, the vice chairman of the Citizens Budget Commission of New York, the total budget figure for New York City this year is 863 million, of which 100 million currently has no source of funds. The mayor plans to increase taxes to fill the gap. Grimm also broke down the budget figures into eight categories, listing the percentages as follows:

Debt: 22.7%

Education: 20.3%

Welfare, Hospitals, and Healthcare: 16.5%

Police: 9.1%

Fire Department: 5%

5.1% [Unspecified]

Health: 4.5%

Water Supply: 0.7%

Other [Including Administrative Expenses]: 21.1%

Total: 100.0%

According to the above statistics, it can be seen that the annual debt repayment and interest payment figures for New York City rank high, and the accumulated deficits over the years are indeed alarming. The second largest expense is administrative fees, accounting for 21.1% of the total. The main expenses in this category are office expenses and salaries for government agencies, as well as the expenses of public libraries and other institutions. Education ranks third, accounting for 20.3%. Therefore, children and young people in New York enjoy higher standards than in other parts of the United States. During the war, New York City spent 182.8 dollars per student per year, which is better than Los Angeles's 159.4 and Detroit's 115.39. However, analyzing where the money goes, 85% of this 1.55 million yuan is spent on the salaries of 33,000 teachers and staff, while the remaining 15% is used for management, repairs, and purchasing supplies. However, this is still enough to show the level of treatment that their teaching staff enjoys.

### Generous Pay Encourages Loyalty and Diligence; Police Administration Is Clear and Effective

Next, let's talk about the police. Currently, there are about 14,000 officers, which is not enough. The mayor has agreed to increase the number to 19,000 in the future. These days, they are recruiting, and more than 10,000 people have applied. The duties are divided into various categories, which are difficult to describe in detail. However, like other major cities, there are few police officers on the streets. It is said that these police officers, no matter how small their role, have an average annual salary of 3,420 dollars, and with other subsidies, they can usually earn 5,000 dollars a year. There are many bonuses here. Last year, the police department paid a total of 15 million dollars in bonuses. The reason why their police administration is relatively clear and effective is largely due to generous pay and encouragement of loyalty and diligence. Speaking of the Fire Department, it is said that New York City only has 8,000 firefighters, with an average of over a hundred buildings per person. However, because there are many fires and the workload is heavy, all are consumption expenditures. The firemen are talented in water and land firefighting, and their salaries and pensions are also very generous, so they account for more than 5% of the city's budget.

### Social Welfare Undertakings Focus on Relief Work

Social welfare in New York City focuses on social relief, such as assisting the elderly who cannot support themselves, treating alcoholics, and providing care for the blind. In addition, there are 27 city-run hospitals with 20,500 beds to accommodate poor citizens, costing as much as 50 million dollars each year. Healthcare focuses on food inspection. The procedures for milk alone are quite cumbersome every day. It is said that usually 3.5 million units are inspected in detail by the Health Bureau, from the cow's udder to the bottling process. In addition, the Health Bureau's work includes venereal disease treatment, child care, and inspection of 100,000 food and drug stores. Therefore, many people are employed, and the expenses cannot be low.

Another 4.5% of the health budget is used for the removal and disposal of garbage and waste. In addition to incineration, one-third of these wastes are now filling up a lot of land. The cleanliness of the streets is also important, but labor costs are high, especially since there is often heavy snow here, a foot deep. Although there are snow plows, people still have to do the work, and it is conceivable that this labor cost will account for a considerable amount. Finally, although the water supply is compensated by water rates, the government still has to pay some money, so there is also a figure of 0.7%.

The above is a rough overview of the expenditures.

### The Main Source of Financial Revenue Is Real Estate Taxes

Let's take a look at the income side. What are their main sources? According to Grimm's analysis, there are five main items, and the percentages are listed as follows:

Real Estate Tax: 55.6%

Ordinary Income: 26.3%

State Education Subsidies: 12.2%

Federal Welfare Subsidies: 2.4%

Other: 3.5%

According to the above analysis, the main source of revenue for New York City comes from real estate owners. The city government assesses the value of real estate throughout the city and charges 2.8 dollars per hundred. No wonder they are good at making money, supporting half of the city's finances. Second, the most important item in ordinary income is water tax, which is usually calculated based on water meters or buildings. The latter is tantamount to a double tax on real estate. The next is the sales tax, which is currently 1%. So, you have to pay extra tax no matter what you buy now. According to last year's statistics, the revenue from this tax was 41 million. Little things add up, and this is another example. It should be noted that the city collects more than this, but federal luxury taxes (such as the purchase of gold pens, gold watches, leather goods, and ornaments, which are subject to an additional 20% heavy tax), car license plates, gasoline, alcohol, and income taxes all go to the central or state government. The city government can only rely on state and federal government subsidies, as well as some public property income, as a source of revenue.

### Financial Situation Is Quite Awkward; Difficult to Cope with for the Time Being

However, even with such an arrangement of the budget's revenue and expenditure situation, New York City's deficit this year is still quite awkward. To sum it up, there are four factors that are difficult to deal with: First, regarding postwar recovery, of the 12,000 to 15,000 former city employees who have served in the military, 90% of them are demanding reinstatement. This budget, including wartime bonuses, is expected to reach 57 million. In addition, an estimated 100 million or more is needed to restore or expand various pre-war and post-war municipal facilities. Second, to build schools, parks, hospitals, health centers, and organize drainage systems, 180 million is needed, and the new recurring expenses are also 76 million per year. Third, the New York subway is also losing money severely, and 50 million has to be bet on it every year. The current five-cent ticket price is too cheap. However, the mayor would rather increase the sales tax than raise the ticket price. Some members of the City Council suggested adding two cents some time ago. As a result, it was also rejected, but this has indeed become a heavy burden on the city's finances. What's more, this year's "prosperity" is not yet in full swing, and it is uncertain whether tax revenues can still maintain the original state. Therefore, a deficit budget has become a problem, and the golden city is really experiencing a financial panic.

According to Grimm, the only way to go is to borrow, but it is also frustrating that the state of New York has set a limit on the city's borrowing, which cannot exceed 10% of the average of five years' worth of real estate tax revenue. This range is already narrow, so it is necessary to find other ways, either by increasing subsidies from the state government, increasing taxes, or suspending non-urgent construction. Of course, they will have their own plans, and we don't need to worry about them. This dispatch is just to briefly observe how others are doing it. (March 11)

### Tragedy of Life in Wenzhou: Rice and Bamboo Baskets Fly Together; Citizens Eager to Alleviate Anemia and Unemployment

— Wenzhou Dispatch, March 31, Correspondent Jiang Tun

Wenzhou, with a population of 140,000, this coastal city is still as cold as winter. The continuous spring rain locks the entire city of Wenzhou in a prison of lingering winter. The gloomy sky with a mournful face makes people unable to smell a hint of spring.

Prices are already like a wild horse that has broken free of its reins, leaping forward and running without looking back. Citizens are sinking into suffering, while merchants are gradually getting up, smiling with oily mouths. They remember the bleak scene of commercial depression after last year's victory, and now they are arrogantly invincible again.

### Rice Store Riot Unleashes a Tragedy

From the above, we can see how crazy the price increase was in fifty days! People are groaning under its high pressure, and life is more miserable than during the war.

Following the jump in prices, rice prices also cast a heavy shadow over the people of Wenzhou. In mid-February, the price of rice was still maintained at around 17 or 18 catties per thousand yuan, but due to the fluctuations in prices, the rice merchants also turned black-hearted and hoarded the rice, and the supply on the market became a problem. However, the 140,000 people in the Wenzhou urban area cannot do without rice to maintain their lives, and the demand is still fixed. Therefore, the price of rice soared in leaps and bounds. By the end of February, it was only 7 catties per thousand yuan. The "rice weevils" still believed that rice prices would rise during this spring famine season, thinking that it was a rare commodity to be hoarded and not sold, claiming that there was no rice on the market. On the 20th, even 7 catties per thousand yuan could not be bought. Running all over the Wenzhou urban area, there was money but no rice to buy. This aroused public anger, and some people knocked on kerosene cans along the way, mobilizing a city-wide strike. A group of starving people rushed into the rice stores and rice mills in batches, destroying counters, baskets, machines, and sundries... For a time, the whole city was in an uproar. Everywhere, rice stores and rice mills were swarmed by the masses. All that could be seen were crowds of people, and grain and bamboo baskets flew together. The turmoil spread to every corner of the city. The police bureau, which was responsible for maintaining law and order, also mobilized all police officers to suppress the situation. However, those ragged policemen, dragging antique rifles, did not dare to say half a word when they saw the emotionally agitated masses and could only stand aside as spectators.

### Girl Lost and Found, Whole Family Smiles Through Tears

— Airmail Dispatch, 4th, from the Capital Police Department

Xiang Guokai, chief secretary of the Chongqing Police Bureau during the war, had his youngest daughter taken away by a big girl adopted by a cook's wife and abandoned by the side of the small train tracks in the capital city. She was then moved and taken away by someone else. After half a day of searching, she was lost and found. The details of the incident are as follows:

The Zheng family lives behind the Central District Police Bureau on Taiping Road. Near noon on March 2nd, Mrs. Zhang went out shopping and ordered the male servant Lao Qian to take care of the child at home. At that time, a nine-year-old girl who was adopted by a cook at the Central District Police Bureau came to play. Lao Qian asked her to hold the one-year-and-five-month-old baby girl for a moment so that he could fetch water to wash things. Unexpectedly, the big girl took the baby and escaped through the back door towards the railway. It was noon, and Mrs. Zheng had just returned home from outside. After learning about this, she sent out search parties, but there was no news, and the whereabouts were unknown. About an hour later, Mr. Zheng rushed over after hearing the news. Director Li Deyang of the Central District Police Bureau immediately sent telegrams to various police stations to search and also telegraphed the Supervision Office of the General Bureau to notify the suburban Xiaguan bureaus to search together.

Afterwards, Lu Ren Officer of the General Bureau, former Township Police Bureau Chief Sun Siyi, and Section Chief Li Qianren of the East Suburban Police Bureau all came to study the search techniques. The result was a decision to use the old method of gonging to spread the news. Mr. Zheng and his family rushed to various places to search, but did not find anything after several hours. Although considerable effort had been made in the investigation, there were no clues. It was already past six o'clock.

Previously, the Zheng family had lost a one-year-and-one-month-old son to illness a week earlier, and now they had suffered this unexpected event, which was truly unbearable. As his wife was in great distress, good news suddenly came. Officer Yang Shuching of the Dragon King Temple Police Station and Cao Xi, together with two local constables, carried a baby, shouting, "Mr. Zheng's one-year-old little girl has been found!" Mr. Zheng and his wife hurried over to take the baby. The child had a lovely smile, and everyone present was overjoyed. According to Officer Yang Shuching, the nine-year-old girl first abandoned the one-year-old baby girl by the side of the needle path and then ran away. The abandoned baby cried loudly at the time and was then taken in by passersby Zhou Zhihe (41 years old, from Huai'an, resident of No. 11 Wufu Lane) and others. Later, people in the same courtyard heard the police station's gonging notification, and Chuan Wenbin (21 years old, from Huai'an) came to report the news. Mr. Zheng then gave cash gifts to the citizens and local constables respectively.

After the incident, Mr. Zheng told people that the nine-year-old girl adopted by the cook's family had such a wicked mind and should be given education and reformation to prevent future harm to society. The recovery of his little baby girl should be attributed to the special enthusiasm of some officers and the great effectiveness of the gonging. On the afternoon of that day, the child was found in less than two hours after the gonging, and its effectiveness was no less than that of foreign broadcasting. I don't have a radio, and gonging is suitable for the general public, especially for finding people, and should not be regarded as outdated. In addition, the enthusiasm of citizens and the police is also extremely important.

### After Two Days of Strike, Emergency Measures Decided

The turmoil continued for two days, and the market strike resembled a semi-closure of shops for two days. Only after the rice shops and rice mills in the Wenzhou urban area were battered and left in disarray did people's anger subside.

Eighth District Administrative Inspector's Office Commissioner Zhang Shichen immediately convened leaders from all sectors of Yongjia to hold an emergency meeting to discuss emergency countermeasures, deciding on six measures:

(1) Starting from the 21st, the price of Yongjia second-grade white rice is set at twelve *shi jin* per 1,000 yuan. The purchase price of grain from rural areas by rice merchants is set at 5,600 yuan per 100 *jin*. If large households hoard and refuse to sell, a report can be made to the county government for official handling, and their stored grain will be forcibly purchased at the military grain purchase price.

(2) Borrow 10,000 *dan* of grain from the Field Grain Office (currently stored in Yongjia), to be issued to the Grain Trade Association and distributed to the market at the stipulated price. An immediate telegram will be sent to Shanghai to purchase enough to repay the loan in full. Any shortfall will be the responsibility of the County Chamber of Commerce and the County Council to raise funds to cover it.

(3) The Police Bureau will dispatch police to notify each of the damaged rice mills to repair their machinery overnight and resume operations immediately, and send troops to protect them.

(4) Encourage the reporting of large households in rural areas who hoard for speculation. Generous rewards will be given to informants.

(5) If any rice merchants or rice shops sell rice exceeding the stipulated price or if there is adulteration with water or other impurities, once discovered, severe punishment will be imposed without leniency.

(6) A Civil Food Adjustment Committee will be organized to commence civil food adjustment work immediately.

After the turmoil subsided, the fair-priced rice at twelve *shi jin* per 1,000 yuan should also appear on the market in a few days. However, due to difficulties arising from the source of grain and funds, it soon became a sporadic situation.

After the Eighth District Administrative Inspector's Office announced the price limit of twelve *shi jin* per 1,000 yuan, the amount of surplus grain transported into the urban area from the countryside immediately decreased and almost disappeared. Fair-priced rice required bringing a household registration card, and even after queuing for a whole day, it was not guaranteed to buy 500 yuan worth. The only option was to find the black market, but the black market was also restricted by the price limit, making it extremely difficult for food consumers to purchase rice. They petitioned the Commissioner's Office to abolish the price limit order. Therefore, Commissioner Zhang Baozhen convened the Yongjia County Civil Food Adjustment Committee on the 5th of this month. The meeting decided: in order to facilitate the flow of grain and stabilize grain prices, the grain price limit will be abolished from March 7th.

Recently, the price of rice has thus jumped to another level, with only six *jin* per 1,000 yuan. People are still enduring the tragic days of living in a state of semi-starvation under the high pressure of grain prices.

### Suffering from Anemia and Falling into Unemployment

The entire social economy, after eight years of war, is showing signs of anemia. Due to various complex reasons, in Wenzhou, apart from a small number of wealthy and powerful people, the general middle and lower classes have a common feeling: "It's difficult to eat." Being able to eat a full three meals a day comfortably is truly not easy!

According to estimates from social figures here, since the victory, Wenzhou has consistently had nearly 10,000 people living in a state of unemployment. Finding a "rice bowl" in Wenzhou is no less difficult than in Shanghai and Hangzhou. In the past, during the war, elementary school teachers were looked down upon, but currently in Wenzhou, they are being fought over by unemployed so-called intellectuals for the meager salary of several thousand yuan per month, barely enough to stave off hunger! Recently, the county government recruited household affairs officers for rural township offices, and it is said that hundreds of people went to apply. Not long ago, the Central Cinema recruited female ushers, and a group of "Misses" who had received considerable education were "competing" there!

Furthermore, laborers who were envied by "scholars" in the past, such as rickshaw pullers and boatmen, have long lost their so-called considerable income. Now, a rickshaw puller runs around like a beast of burden all day, and after paying the rickshaw rental, it is not even enough to buy two or three *jin* of rice. If you walk through the docks, many rickshaw pullers and boatmen will come up to solicit business, which shows how tense their struggle for survival is.

Various government agencies are implementing layoffs. As a result, a large number of small, unattached civil servants have been squeezed out, unable to find "positions" for the time being, leaving them at a dead end.

Wenzhou, this coastal city with a population of 140,000, may it soon escape the shadow of poverty and turn towards the warm spring sunshine!

### Save Shandong

— Lu Min

During the eight years of the War of Resistance, we resisted foreign aggression externally to seek international freedom and equality, and pursued peaceful unification internally to achieve national prosperity and happiness. The entire nation swore to devote itself to this cause, enduring hardships and remaining steadfast. Ultimately, justice triumphed over might, and righteousness defeated aggression. Joyful news spread throughout the country, and the nation rejoiced. This was the perfect opportunity for our people to recuperate, rebuild, and seize this once-in-a-millennium chance. However, just as foreign aggression was quelled, internal strife arose again, causing unrest throughout the country, especially in Shandong. Over the past eight years, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has used the name of resistance against Japan to carry out separatist activities. The power it has accumulated undermines national unity, causing fragmentation and disintegration. It destroys the ethics and morals of the people, plunders their assets, and endangers their lives. In the name of "democracy," it carries out separatist activities, distorting public opinion with heresy and coercing it with threats. The abuses and atrocities are too numerous to list. Here, I will briefly describe the most egregious examples:

"A Doctrine of Hanging a Sheep's Head While Selling Dog Meat." — The CCP's consistent style is to be duplicitous and deceitful, tricking enthusiastic outsiders into their trap. Recently, they have intensified their efforts, creating class antagonism everywhere and doing everything possible to incite discord. They even force husbands and wives to turn against each other and siblings to kill each other. They also use a large number of local ruffians and hooligans who commit all kinds of evil to launch

"Universal and Extremely Brutal Struggles," — even middle and lower-class families are not spared. Those who are struggled against, whether male or female, are stripped naked and humiliated, and their families are bankrupted. They are invariably subjected to methods such as being dragged by horses, buried alive, assassinated, and tortured to death. The so-called

"Dragging by Horses," — cannot be interpreted literally. This is a variation of the brutal Qin Dynasty torture of "dismemberment by five horses." All those who are struggled against or who do not submit to their deception are tied to the back of a horse with a long rope, and the horse is whipped to gallop until the flesh is a blur, the bones are exposed, and they are dragged to death. Women in the area who refuse to obey orders to watch performances and dances that destroy morality and shame, such as the *yangge* dance (similar to the hula dance, with lewd ditties hummed in the mouth), are stripped naked, their bodies completely bare, and two people drag them by their feet along the ground, their faces crushed, their breasts scraped off, a sight too horrible to bear, until they die. Their bodies are then discarded in the wilderness, left for dogs to devour, as a warning to others. In the space of a month, tens of thousands have been "dragged by horses." Recently, they have also set a

"Three-Month Plan," — to completely slaughter all the local elites within three months. Directly and indirectly, countless people have died as a result. The remaining people, all those between the ages of eighteen and fifty, are all

"Forcibly Conscripted into the Militia." — If they resist or evade, they are immediately executed or their families are severely punished. The law of joint responsibility is also established to bind them. Each person is given four hand grenades and driven to the front lines to sabotage transportation and attack the National Army. When they launch sneak attacks, they adopt the inhumane

"Five-Wave Human-Wave Tactics," — that is, using militia, hundreds of times more numerous than the National Army, as the vanguard, attacking in five waves, while the communist troops cover the rear with machine guns to urge them on. The purpose is to use the lives of a large number of innocent people to deplete the limited ammunition of the National Army, using the common people as cannon fodder and human lives as tools. Their insidious motives and wolfish nature are such. Therefore, everyone feels insecure and strives to escape, but under their strict surveillance, it is impossible to escape the communist-controlled areas. For whenever the communist party arrives at a place, they first

"Block Traffic." — They force villagers to guard posts and interrogate pedestrians. Travel between neighboring villages is impossible without a pass stamped with a chain of seals from the district chief, village chief, head of the regiment, and head of the National Salvation Association. Recovered areas are all on the list of blocked areas and cannot be traveled to. Those who disobey will be buried alive. The reality of their policy of freedom of speech is that two people dare not whisper to each other, otherwise, once detected, they will be labeled

"Ideologically Stubborn, Reactionary, or a National Army Spy," — and few will escape with their lives. All radio receivers in small and medium-sized cities are confiscated within two days of the communist troops occupying the area, to implement their slogan of "freedom." Forcing donations and seizing weapons is no longer surprising. In the meantime, sleeping with closed doors is prohibited, and the communist party can enter and exit at will,

"Property and Chastity are Subject to Thefts." — During the day, they use the pretext of meetings to force young women to participate in order to satisfy their lust and insult them. If the women's fathers object to their going, they will be forced to make their "fathers and daughters, fathers-in-law and daughters-in-law dance" — in order to humiliate them. Therefore, everyone eagerly awaits the government's rescue, like a great drought longing for rain clouds. If this thought is detected, they will be severely tortured. After torture, more than ten tables are stacked up and the victim is forced to kneel on top, and then the tables are pushed over, causing the victim to fall to the ground and die, and this is called

"Looking at the Sky Celebration." — Intellectuals who refuse to be exploited are regarded as thorns in their flesh and needles in their eyes, either suffering assassination or disappearing at night. Recently, students in Yantai questioned the communist party's behavior of insulting women and more than ten were killed on the spot, and more than fifty disappeared that night. Private collections of books are all forced to be reported. Except for *On New Democracy*, *Coalition Government*, *Dialectical Materialism*, and other communist books, all are taken away and burned, to complete Qin Shi Huang's unfinished task of

"Burning Books and Burying Scholars Alive." — Hundreds of thousands of bags of relief supplies such as flour from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration were shipped to North China a month ago, but the people have not seen a single grain of flour. All of it has been used to supply the communist army, increasing its power to attack the National Army, sabotage transportation, disrupt the area, and harm the people. Recently, a large number of people have been risking their lives to escape. Seeing this, the communist party has resorted to even more vicious means. Men who are outside, whether they have recently escaped or were originally outside, are forced to have their families call them back before the end of May, otherwise, in addition to confiscating their family property, all the women in their families between the ages of sixteen and fifty will be

"Forcibly Assigned to Bandits to Satisfy Their Bestial Desires." — The various atrocities are too numerous to record. The hideous faces behind their masks, and the extremely cruel methods, are unimaginable to those who have not experienced them firsthand. The people of Shandong are in such a dire situation, like water becoming deeper, like fire becoming hotter. If they are not rescued quickly, then there will be no survivors left in Shandong! The Soviet Union's activities in the industrial areas of Northeast China aroused the suspicion of the Chinese people. Special drawing by the Newspaper Data Room.

### The Future of Peking Opera

— Shi Run

I am a layman when it comes to Peking Opera, but I am very interested in it, and I go to see a few performances every month.

I feel that Peking Opera is too conservative. It has not progressed or reformed at all. Are the signature performances of today's Peking Opera stars any different from those of Tan Xinpei when he served as an imperial performer? Forty or fifty years have passed since then. Can you find any signs of progress at all?

The wheel of time is moving forward and changing with each passing day. Yesterday's events are old history. If you don't keep up with the times, you will fall behind. Peking Opera has already fallen far behind the times. If it doesn't pick itself up and catch up, it will become like Kunqu Opera, and people will no longer pay attention to it. Fortunately, the distance between Peking Opera and the times is still visible, and it is still possible to catch up.

Mr. Ouyang Yuqian should be the pioneer of Peking Opera! It's just that his efforts ended in a Waterloo. I hope he deeply examines and reflects on the root causes of his failure. Remove the essence and keep the dross. Sitting on the cold benches of the theater to watch reheated leftovers is something that makes anyone's butt hurt. I wish Mr. Ouyang success in making a comeback and establishing a solid foundation for Peking Opera like that of film and spoken drama.

What are the strengths of Peking Opera? This is what those who want to reform Peking Opera should pay attention to. I think that the unique feature that allows Peking Opera to stand alongside film and spoken drama is its stylized singing, movements, music, and makeup, which are deeply in line with artistic principles. When we see the lines and actions in film and spoken drama, the throwing of a hand, a word, a movement, a state, an emotion, and a cough, all strive for realism and naturalness. However, the results are often unsatisfactory, appearing stiff, unnatural, and too mechanical. They never seem to be in the environment they are performing in, seeming artificial, making the audience feel goosebumps, feeling overdone, feeling that they are trying to look like it but failing. It cannot immerse the audience in the play. This is a shortcoming of film and spoken drama (especially spoken drama). As for why film and spoken drama have a wide audience, that is due to other reasons. Peking Opera sees through this point. Theater is ultimately theater. Rather than making the audience feel that it is not realistic or lifelike, it is better to make it conform to a certain rhythm, that is, to stylize it, and to devote itself to the expression of true art. Therefore, only Peking Opera can overcome the above-mentioned difficulties and immerse the audience in the play, because art is beautiful, and only the beauty of art can give the audience pleasure and regulation, which is in line with the purpose of entertainment. Therefore, Peking Opera audiences will unconsciously hum along to the songs and tunes. When opera fans are indulging in wine and women, they will hum "The Lonely King is Drunk in the Peach Blossom Palace," and answer questions with "That is indeed so." As for the amateur performers who put on makeup and perform, they are completely immersed in the play.

This stylized result allows the actors' skills to be very exquisite and sophisticated. Their signature plays can indeed leave people with endless aftertaste. The beauty of Peking Opera lies here. Now, several self-proclaimed reformers of Peking Opera in Shanghai have discarded these characteristics as if they were worn-out shoes. The facial makeup is gone, the movements are not paid attention to, and the accompaniment of string and wind instruments only has a small gong left. The so-called progress of Peking Opera through their efforts has only resulted in it picking up some of the dregs of spoken drama, adding some mechanical stage settings, sword-wielding heroes and deities, and the open fighting style of street performers, sacrificing the physical appearance in a sensual dance to attract the audience, selling gimmicks, and making money. Calling it Peking Opera is already not Peking Opera. It is extremely naive, pandering to the low-level tastes of clerks and servants, and resembling civilized drama.

The audience of Peking Opera no longer feels its supreme beauty. They want to see the cunning and treacherous manipulations of Jiang Gan. They still return to the old plays to seek satisfaction, even though the old plays have no progress or reform.

I hope that the farsighted gentlemen in the Peking Opera world will recognize the essence and dross of Peking Opera, and make the greatest determination to reform Peking Opera and crown it with the beautiful title of "National Opera."

### Film and Drama News

Fei has gone to his hometown of Suzhou to write a script. After returning to Shanghai, he is actively preparing for filming. Fei is one of the city councilors, and he has been busy preparing for the filming work, so he has not been able to attend this session of the council. Fei recently went to Suzhou again, not only to escort his mother back to his hometown, but also to shoot exterior scenes in Suzhou.

Wu Yonggang's "Loyal and Brave Family" has been prepared. The budget is being rushed to be made, and costumes and props are being prepared. The staff of China Electric Film Studio II are quite busy. The first set has also begun to be built. The film will be photographed by Xue Boqing, recorded by Tan Heming, and starred by Qin Yi and Liu Qiong. The set will be designed by Li Enjie of the China Repertory Theater.

The Shanghai Drama and Film Joint Company was founded by Shi Dongsha, Ji Zongde, and others. A thick book of plans was printed in Chongqing, and they are currently raising funds and recruiting shareholders.

The second program of the China Electric Film Studio Theater after coming to Shanghai, *Twenty-Four Hours in Chongqing*, has been staged at the Lyceum Theater. The play is a successful work by Shen Fu, with many gags. It was very popular in Chongqing, but the audience in Shanghai is not enthusiastic. The reason may be that the hype in the play is mostly from Chongqing, such as the terms and meanings of "hanging the ball," "air raid shelters," "Jiangnan people," and "Renewal Fortress," which may not be understood by people in Shanghai.

The arrival of American color films in Shanghai has not only broken the terrible record of Shanghai spoken drama, but also made several meaningful literary and drama films produced in the United States during the war, such as *The Rhine Watch*, *The Pied Piper*, and *The Bell of Adano*, have a dismal business.

Wu Yonggang collected a lot of information about life in Shanghai during the occupation when he wrote *Loyal and Brave Family*. There are many interesting details, and the film is sure to give people in Shanghai a high sense of realism when it is finished.

Chen Jingting will be filming a play for China Electric Film Studio II after Wu Yonggang's *Loyal and Brave Family*. The first draft of the script has been completed and is tentatively titled *Distant Love*. It will be starred by famous actor Zhao Dan.

Zhao Dan will also direct a play. Zhao has been revising the script and collecting information extensively out of caution, and is currently engrossed in creating it.

The newsreel work of China Electric Film Studio II (Beijing) is quite tense. Recently, seven more copies have been shipped to Shanghai, including *US-China Cooperation: US Troops in Beijing* and *Reception in Northeast China*.

Weekly Film Review

### Loyal and Brave Family

— Lang Huan

*Mrs. Miniver* was originally a popular American novel that caused a sensation when it was published. Readers have loved it for a long time.

The story tells of the joys and sorrows and everyday trivialities of a middle-class family in Britain during the outbreak of World War II. Mr. Miniver is in the construction business and lives with his wife in the village of Belham, near London. Their modest income is just enough for them to live a slightly "luxurious" and comfortable life. Life is so peaceful and leisurely.

Mrs. Miniver meets stationmaster Ballard while buying a hat. Ballard wants to use her name to name a flower and enter it in a flower competition, which attracts Miss Beldon. Miniver's eldest son, Wayne, falls in love with Miss Beldon, but at this time, the news of Britain and Germany declaring war suddenly arrives, and the whole village enters a state of war. This is followed by Wayne enlisting in the army, and Mr. Miniver driving a motorboat to rescue British troops retreating from Dunkirk. In these hurried and chaotic events, the wedding of Wayne and Beldon and the grand flower competition are interspersed. Just as the flower competition ends, an air raid alarm suddenly sounds, and the newlywed Miss Beldon unfortunately dies in the air raid.

The whole book tells of some trivial things and depicts some ordinary characters, but the good thing about the whole book is that the events are trivial, but the details are clear and not chaotic; the characters are ordinary, but their personalities are meticulously portrayed, full of the flavor of life. I really like the book *Mrs. Miniver*. I feel that after Austen and Galsworthy, it is rare to use a leisurely tone and pick everyday trivialities to depict the somber personality, rich sense of humor, appreciation of life, and exploration of human relationships of the British middle class. This book is indeed a very successful work. The only difference is that the background of *Mrs. Miniver* is taken from the recent war, which makes the readers feel more intimate and interesting, and at the same time, the war can more clearly reflect the tenacious personality of the British people.

This novel, which is worth recommending, was made into a film by MGM, directed by William Wyler, and starred Greer Garson and Walter Pidgeon. It is now being shown at the Grand Theatre, and the film is renamed *Loyal and Brave Family*.

After watching the film, I felt very satisfied. However, I feel that the success of this film is certainly due to Greer Garson, but the director's choice of the right protagonists is something that cannot be ignored. Greer Garson's somber personality is really perfect for the role of Mrs. Miniver. Walter Pidgeon's acting is very stable, and he is unwilling to let go of even small movements. Teresa Wright's Miss Beldon, Richard Ney's Wayne, and Henry Travers's stationmaster, all perform admirably in the scenes of arguing, dancing, and winning awards.

It is very difficult to please with literary and artistic films. This is partly because after a work is made into a film, after deletions and excerpts, it often loses the original harmony and beauty. It is also partly because in literary and artistic films, even if the protagonist's acting is superb and successful, if the supporting actors cannot grasp the plot even occasionally, it will often destroy the style of the original work. I remember that Greer Garson's acting in *Pride and Prejudice* (Austen's *Pride and Prejudice*) was quite successful, but the performances of Mrs. Bennet and Mr. Collins were too overdone, which made Austen's middle-class British family imbued with the breath of American small-shop women, and the style of the original work was completely lost. Of course, a literary film cannot be too拘泥to the original work, but in a film, if there are too many contradictions and incompatibilities in the national personality and the background of the times and society, it is not very good. I think this may be because of the times, and the actors feel it is more difficult to simulate. However, in the film *Loyal and Brave Family*, because the actors are evenly distributed, the spirit of the original work can be maintained. This is something that the original work can feel happy about.

### Answering Readers' Questions

Liu Xinqing asks: I have always been physically weak and first contracted a cough six years ago, suffering from multiple illnesses, including wheezing and rapid nasal breathing, and rapid heartbeat (symptoms resembling acute bronchitis). My throat is narrow, leading to difficulty swallowing and frequent choking. An X-ray examination diagnosed "tuberculosis of the lymph nodes on both sides of the pulmonary hilum, clear and normal lung fields, and a normal heart." Currently, my symptoms include a pale complexion and a thin physique. I implore medical experts to provide detailed guidance.

Dr. Yu Xinen answers: I believe it is due to the upper respiratory system being prone to infection. Physical weakness and excessive fatigue can both contribute to this condition. In addition to being especially careful about diet and health during cold and hot weather, it is important to focus on nutrition, such as eating more eggs, pig liver, spinach, and cod liver oil containing large amounts of vitamin A.

Fang Yanqiu asks: Eight years ago, my right ear and face became red and swollen, making eating very difficult. After ten days, it subsided naturally, but I lost hearing in my right ear. Questions: (1) Is the constant buzzing and ringing in my ear like cicadas or bells tinnitus or is my eardrum damaged, making me deaf? (2) If it is tinnitus, are there any economical and simple ways to diagnose and treat it? (3) If my eardrum is broken, will the ringing in my ear still occur?

Dr. Yu Xin answers: The initial illness was likely otitis media and mastoiditis (mastoid bone). The eardrum has either ruptured or thickened, preventing hearing. Medication is unlikely to be effective. You can try the Eustachian tube inflation method at an ear, nose, and throat specialist, but the results cannot be guaranteed.
