### Debate Opens on the Capital Issue; Applause Resounds in the First Review Committee; Zhang Ji Firmly Supports Establishing the Capital in Beiping

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 11th] The capital issue, which has attracted the most attention in the draft constitution, unfolded into heated debate on the 11th in the First Review Committee. Zhang Ji acted as the vanguard for those advocating establishing the capital in Beiping, while Liu Baimin was put forward as the speaker for those advocating establishing the capital in Nanjing. Social notable Chou Ao put forward a third proposal, suggesting establishing it in the most challenging location of Xi'an. Each presented eloquent arguments, deliberating for nearly two hours from 4:15 PM to 6:00 PM without reaching a final conclusion. It was decided to continue the discussion at 9:00 AM on the 12th, where another fierce debate is anticipated. Zhang Zhiben announced the discussion of the seventh article of the general outline, the capital issue, immediately after the discussion of the national flag issue. The entire hall burst into applause, the atmosphere shifting from silence to enthusiastic discussion. Zhang Jiyan, the Liaoning representative advocating establishing the capital in Beiping, was the first to speak, believing this issue was about "determining the capital" rather than "establishing the capital." He hoped everyone would follow their conscience and consider the nation and people first. He then pointed out the advantages of establishing the capital in Beiping from a historical perspective, using the Ming and Qing dynasties as examples to illustrate that establishing the capital in Beiping would allow the country to enjoy long-term peace and stability. In contrast, the Liang Dynasty of Emperor Wu and the Republic of China in Nanjing faced many internal and external troubles. Geographically, Beiping is also more advantageous for defense, unlike Nanjing which is easily threatened. He also explained that the Japanese coveting the Northeast was due to our government being far away in Nanjing, unable to attend to North China, let alone take care of the Northeast, which led to the September 18th Incident. The next to speak was Chou Ao. Although he was from Hunan, he considered the overall situation and strongly advocated establishing the capital in Xi'an. His reason was that our people should choose the most challenging and needy location for the capital. The Northwest is becoming increasingly desolate, with a declining population. We should not be greedy for the comfort of Nanjing or Beiping and forget the Northwest. Please do not forget the ancient saying of "born in sorrow, die in peace." At this point, Zhang Ji, a veteran of the party and the nation, spoke, and the entire hall applauded warmly. Zhang first explained that the capital is the most important and concrete issue in the entire constitution, hoping not to act impulsively. This matter is not a North-South dispute, nor a party dispute. The Kuomintang has not made a decision on this, so there is complete freedom of discussion. He analyzed the proposals related to the capital issue, believing that only a very small number supported establishing the capital in Nanjing, while the vast majority favored establishing the capital in Beiping, hoping not to go against the will of the people. Zhang explained the original intention of Sun Yat-sen's proposal to establish the capital in Nanjing, stating: "I can say with certainty that Sun Yat-sen's proposal to establish the capital in Nanjing was a temporary matter, not permanent. In terms of environment and reality, I support establishing the capital in Beiping. Some oppose establishing the capital there because it is close to powerful neighbors, fearing it is unsafe. However, we should know the ancient saying of "born in sorrow, die in peace." The more dangerous it is, the more we should move there. Even our military authority General Chen Cheng and others recently shared this view during discussions. If we establish the capital in Nanjing again, we will inevitably perish." After these words, the audience applauded greatly. He Sui, the original proposer of not specifying the location of the capital in the constitution, spoke, believing that the constitution is permanent and should not include the fluid issue of the capital. In this atomic age, if there is a war, Nanjing must move its capital, and Beiping will have to move as well. It is better not to specify it. The Hebei representative refuted establishing the capital in Nanjing with a humorous tone, stating: "Sun Yat-sen established the capital in Nanjing because the feudal colors were too strong, the warlord forces were deeply rooted, and there were foreign forces. Currently, all of the above have been swept away. Moreover, the representatives of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Guangdong provinces have jointly signed this proposal, which shows that it is not just the opinion of the northern representatives." He argued that there are not many houses, and government agencies can operate in Beiping after the relocation. He also explained that even if there are practical difficulties, the constitution will not be implemented immediately after the decision, but will be delayed. Sun Chunwu, the Beiping representative, and Qi Bihou, the Suiyuan representative, spoke on behalf of 200 million people of three nationalities, advocating establishing the capital in Beiping. Wu Xiaodao, based on border and national defense reasons, advocated establishing the capital in Nanjing and explained the difficulties of moving the capital, arguing that deciding but temporarily not moving is equivalent to writing a blank check. He Yangling said that the charter stipulates establishing the capital in Nanjing, and all parties have agreed, and explained that history is not a strong proof of establishing the capital in Beiping, while the three revolutionary governments of the Ming Dynasty, Hong Xiuquan, and Sun Yat-sen all established the capital in Nanjing. Ren Zhuoxuan believed that the capital is one matter, and foreign troubles are another. Establishing the capital in Beiping has also resulted in loss of power and humiliation. This matter should be blamed on the government, not on the location. Liu Baimin refuted Zhang Ji's theory, believing that Sun Yat-sen not only temporarily advocated establishing the capital in Nanjing, but also had a plan for permanently establishing the capital in Nanjing in his industrial plan. Nanjing is truly the revolutionary capital, and please remember the story of the Nanjing Massacre by the Japanese. The heated debate continued until 6:00 PM. Those requesting to speak were still eager, so it was decided to continue the discussion on the 12th.

### Second Review Committee Passes Resolution: Defining the National Assembly's Powers; The National Assembly is the Highest Organ for Exercising Political Power

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 11th] The Second Review Committee of the Constitutional Draft held its fourth plenary meeting at 9:00 AM on the 11th in the Assembly Hall. 257 representatives attended. Chairman Zhang Qiang first reported that the work of organizing the proposals had not yet been completed and deeply apologized. Shao Lizi then suggested saving time by not compiling and organizing the extensive opinions, and proposed that the proposals be discussed immediately and voted on quickly after the organizing work was completed. Kong Geng and others immediately objected, saying that not only should the extensive opinions from the past be compiled and organized, but extensive discussions should continue. Thus, the representatives spoke one after another until the meeting was adjourned at 11:50 AM.

The meeting continued at 3:40 PM in the Assembly Hall. 211 representatives attended, chaired by Zhu Hongru. They began discussing the third chapter, "National Assembly," of the constitutional draft article by article. Most representatives argued that the nature of the National Assembly must be defined. Although Shao Lizi and Tao Xisheng strongly advocated discussing the constitutional draft as it was, the assembly still passed a motion to add "The National Assembly is the highest organ for the people of the Republic of China to exercise political power" at the beginning of the chapter, as Article 26. The original Article 26 was moved to Article 27, and was partially amended to "The National Assembly shall be composed of the following representatives: (1) Each county and city, and areas of equal status, shall elect one representative, and an additional representative shall be elected for every 300,000 people. (2) The number of representatives from the Mongol leagues, Tibet, and minority nationalities shall be determined by law." The provisions for legislative and supervisory committee members to be representatives of the National Assembly were all deleted. The provisions for representatives of overseas Mongols and overseas Chinese were left for further discussion on the 12th due to insufficient time. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.

### Review Work Completed on the "President" Chapter of the Constitutional Draft
The Third Review Committee Continued its Meeting Yesterday

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 11th] The Third Review Committee of the Constitutional Draft held its forty-first plenary meeting at 9:00 AM on the 11th, with 112 representatives attending. Shi Shangkuan, Chairman, continued to discuss the articles of the "President" chapter of the constitutional draft. Article 44 was amended to "In the event of a national emergency, natural disaster (the words "plague and epidemic" were deleted), or a major change in national finance or economy, requiring immediate action, the President may, during the recess of the Legislative Yuan, issue emergency decrees based on the decision of the Executive Yuan Council and in accordance with the Emergency Decree Law, and take necessary measures, but must submit them to the Legislative Yuan for ratification within one month after the issuance of the order. If the Legislative Yuan does not agree, the emergency decree shall immediately become invalid." In addition, Articles 45 to 53, totaling nine articles, were passed to maintain the original text. The review work of the fourth chapter was completed at 12:00 noon.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 7th] When the Third Review Committee of the Constitutional Draft held its third meeting on the 10th, it made a detailed discussion on the articles of the fourth chapter, "President." In addition to Articles 36, 37, 40, 42, and 43, totaling five articles, being passed as is, Article 38 was discussed extensively due to its broad content. Article 39 was amended to "The President shall exercise the power to conclude treaties and declare war and make peace in accordance with the provisions of this Constitution (the five characters "Article 63" were deleted)." Article 41 was amended to "The President shall exercise the power to (the two characters "amnesty" were deleted) (grant pardons, reduce sentences, and restore rights) in accordance with the law (the entire sentence "The Minister of Judicial Administration shall submit the foregoing matters regarding pardons, sentence reductions, and restorations of rights to the President in accordance with the law" in the second paragraph was deleted)." Article 44, due to the issue of the Legislative Yuan recess, did not immediately reach a result. To be discussed on the 11th.

### Premier of the Executive Yuan Vacant, Deputy Premier to Act as Proxy
Resolution of the Third Review Committee

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 11th] The Third Review Committee of the Constitutional Draft continued its meeting in the First Lounge at 3:40 PM, with 109 representatives attending, still chaired by Shi Shangkuan. The review work of the fifth chapter, "Executive," of the draft constitutional amendment was started. Articles 54 and 55 were successfully passed. Article 56 was passed after an hour of heated discussion, based on the amendment proposed by Wang Shijie, adding the provision that the Deputy Premier of the Executive Yuan shall act as proxy during the absence of the Premier. It was amended to "The Premier shall be nominated by the President and appointed with the consent of the Legislative Yuan. During the recess of the Executive Yuan, if the Premier resigns or is absent, the Deputy Premier of the Executive Yuan shall act as proxy, but the Legislative Yuan must be convened within 40 days to submit a candidate for the Premier for consent. Before the candidate for the Premier nominated by the President is approved by the Legislative Yuan, the Deputy Premier shall temporarily act as proxy." Article 57 was amended to include the appointment of the Deputy Premier, and amended to "The Deputy Premier of the Executive Yuan, the heads of the ministries and commissions, and the ministers without portfolio shall be appointed by the President upon the nomination of the Premier of the Executive Yuan." At 5:20 PM, the discussion of Article 58 began. There was extremely fierce dispute over the Executive Yuan being responsible to the Legislative Yuan on certain matters. By the time the meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM, no conclusion had been reached. It was decided to continue the meeting at 9:00 AM on the 12th to continue the discussion.

### Press Conference of the Central Propaganda Department: Answering Questions on Constitution-Making

### "Double Twelfth" Anniversary: No Expanded Ceremonies in Lintong and Xi'an

[Our Xi'an Dispatch, 11th] This reporter returned from Lintong early this morning, along the way, the biting north wind and frost made the cold comparable to the snowfall on this morning ten years ago. The Lintong Valley Military Officers' Corps has no special plans for expanded ceremonies on the 12th to commemorate this turning point in Chinese national history ten years ago. Xi'an also has no expanded commemorative ceremonies on the 12th, presumably to be held together on the 25th.

### Article 1 of the General Outline of the Constitutional Draft: "The Republic of China is a Democratic Republic Based on the Three Principles of the People" Passed by Majority of the First Review Committee

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 11th] Article 1 of the General Outline of the Constitutional Draft was put to a vote again at the fourth meeting of the First Review Committee on the 11th. With 153 people present, it was passed by a majority of 107 votes, amended to "The Republic of China is a Democratic Republic Based on the Three Principles of the People." However, the Qingniantuan representative Chang stated in public that since the case had been passed by an absolute majority, the minority party did not intend to express further opinions in the meeting, but reserved the right to speak, so as to speak in the general assembly. The MinSheDang also reserved the right to speak on Article 1. Article 2 of the Constitutional Draft originally read: "The sovereignty of the Republic of China belongs to the entire people," was also changed to "The sovereignty of the Republic of China belongs to the entire nation" by a majority of 116 votes. The original Article 3, "Those with the nationality of the Republic of China are citizens of the Republic of China" was passed unanimously without dissent.

The first review meeting was held at the Central Party Headquarters at 9:45 AM on the morning of the 11th. Zhang Zhiben was the chairman, discussing how to deal with the issue of Article 1 of the General Outline, which was voted on at yesterday's meeting but did not pass the majority. At that time, opinions could be divided into two factions. Qingniantuan Min Da, Zhou Dou San, and others advocated sending the results of yesterday's discussion to the Comprehensive Committee for review. Jiang Wanping and others seconded, but most representatives generally advocated re-examining various opinions at today's meeting, based on Article 50 of the National Assembly Rules of Procedure, "If the result of the vote is still inconclusive, and if it is an issue that cannot be abandoned, it should be submitted for review again." Min Da and others believed that the second review was illegal, insisted on submitting it to the Comprehensive Committee, and once expressed their intention to withdraw. The atmosphere at the meeting was quite tense. Li Junfu of the MinSheDang rose to explain "the opinions of most people inside and outside the meeting," but before he could finish, dozens of representatives stood up to speak, the order was extremely chaotic, but Huang Shaogu, one of the conveners, spoke loudly, explaining the situation, and said "It is a pity that this kind of misunderstanding has been caused," and the meeting returned to calm. The vote should send to the comprehensive committee, and only seventy-one of the one hundred and fifty-four people present at the time agreed, which was less than half. However, in order to avoid involving political issues and to maintain harmony at the meeting, a reverse vote was taken again. Eighty-two people agreed to continue the discussion, and the review continued. First, it was decided to vote on the two proposals with the most votes. "The Republic of China is a democratic republic based on the Three Principles of the People" received only 33 votes and was rejected. "The Republic of China is a democratic republic based on the Three Principles of the People" passed with a majority of 107 votes, and the entire hall applauded.

At this point, Wu Yanhuan, the Hebei representative, rose to speak and said: "I am a member of the Kuomintang and I am willing to reconcile with the facts and not quibble over words." Qingniantuan representative Min Da Zheng Gong stated: "Since this issue has been voted on and the supporters accounted for an absolute majority, the minority party's opinion does not intend to be expressed in the meeting, but reserves the right to speak, so that they can speak in the general assembly." Those present applauded in agreement with this spirit.

After the passage of this important Article 1, the representatives calmly continued to discuss Article 2. The original text of this article was "The sovereignty of the Republic of China belongs to the entire people." The representatives put forward a total of nine amendments to the case, which can be summarized into major categories, the most important change being the proposal to change the words "people" to "nation." Qingniantuan Xia Erkang recognized that "people" and "nation" are different and cannot be considered as one. Zhou Zhi Shan, the Jiangsu representative, said: If "people" is used, it will be inconsistent with the foregoing and Article 3, and pointed out that the provisional law of the Republic of China stipulated "belonging to the nation." Jiang Wanping, a professional representative, also recognized that we came to the meeting as national representatives, why not use "nation." Ren Zhuoxuan recognized that foreign overseas Chinese reside in our country and enjoy the rights of the people, but they have not obtained nationality and are not our citizens, so they are not a source of sovereignty, and sovereignty should come from citizens who have obtained nationality.

Chen Guyuan said: The constitutional draft used "people" instead of "nation" because of its reasons. At the same time, sovereignty resides in the nation, and it is easy to turn the theory of people's sovereignty into national sovereignty, and evolve into a German-style centralized country, hoping that the original drafter will explain. Wu Jingxiong rose to report, explaining the contract law and the Temple of Heaven Constitution, saying that according to the latter, sovereignty belongs to the "people," and pointed out the difference between belonging to the people and being transferred to the government, but recognized that this point should be paid to the right of the word in the end. Voting, 160 people were present at the time, and by a majority of 116 votes, the "people" was changed to "nation," and the full text was changed to "The sovereignty of the Republic of China belongs to the entire nation," and the entire audience also applauded unanimously.

After discussing Article 3, "Those who have the nationality of the Republic of China are citizens of the Republic of China", the entire audience unanimously agreed to maintain the original case without dissent, and the amendment was not discussed.

### The Constitution Addresses the Territory Issue: Passed Using a General Approach

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 11th] How the constitution should address the territory issue was discussed in detail at the meeting of the First Review Committee on the 11th in the morning and afternoon, and by a majority vote, the original case "The territory of the Republic of China shall not be changed except in accordance with law based on its inherent territory" was amended to "The territory of the Republic of China shall not be changed without the resolution of the National Assembly based on its inherent territory." Article 5 "All ethnic groups in the Republic of China are equal" and Article 6 "The national flag of the Republic of China is determined to be a red background with a blue sky and white sun in the upper left corner" were briefly discussed and passed to maintain the original case.

### Sixth Review Committee Holds Fifth and Sixth Meetings

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 11th] The Sixth Review Committee of the Constitutional Draft held its fifth and sixth meetings on the 11th, chaired by Gu Zhengding and Fang Shaoyun, respectively. A total of Articles 114, 116, 118, and 119 were passed throughout the day. Article 115 was entrusted to Zhang Wei, Ruan Yicheng, Zhang Bolun, Deng Xianghai, Li Yu, Fang Shaoyun, and Liu Zhongyi for reorganization, and then submitted to the general assembly for discussion. For Article 117, the convener asked the drafter to attend and explain on the 12th before discussing. Article 120 was decided to continue the discussion on the 12th and then reorganize.

### Seventh Review Committee: Work of Two Groups Concluded

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 11th] In addition to the First National Defense Diplomacy and Fourth Social Security groups of the Seventh Review Committee of the Constitutional Draft having concluded their work, the Third Education and Culture Group held a reorganization group meeting at 9:00 AM, attended by Chuan Sinian, Lai Lian, and others, to summarize and reorganize the relevant proposals and various general opinions, actively carrying out the work, and only dispersing at 12:30 noon. The Second National Economic Group continued its meeting at 3:40 PM in the afternoon in addition to the morning meeting, with 88 representatives attending, still chaired by Liu Zhendong. According to the proposals of Wang Xiaolai and others, the following articles were discussed and passed to replace the provisions on agricultural land in the first half of Article 139 of the constitutional draft amendment: (1) "The land in the territory of the Republic of China belongs to all citizens. The ownership obtained by the people in accordance with the law shall be protected and restricted by law. Private land shall be taxed according to convenience, and the government may levy education according to price." (2) "Minerals attached to the land and natural forces that are economically available for public benefit belong to the state and are not affected by the ownership obtained by the people" (3) "The value of land that increases not due to the application of labor and capital shall be returned to the people for public enjoyment by collecting land appreciation tax" (4) "The state's distribution and reorganization of land shall be based on the principle of planting self-cultivating farmers and people who use land on their own." The meeting was adjourned at 6:00 PM. It was decided to hold a convener meeting at 10:00 AM on the 12th and a fifth group plenary meeting at 3:00 PM in the afternoon. The Third Education and Culture Group reorganization group also continued its work at 2:00 PM in the afternoon, and after referring to the 55 Constitutional Draft and amendments to the various established proposals and general opinions, ten articles were drafted and organized, including everything from the purpose of education to the protection of cultural and educational undertakings, and it was decided to submit them to the fourth group plenary meeting at 9:00 AM on the 12th.

### MinSheDang Issues Statement: Reserves Opinion on the Name of the Country: Requests the Comprehensive Committee to Resubmit for a Vote

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 11th] Jiang Yuntian, the spokesperson of the MinSheDang, issued a statement late on the 11th, saying: "At this evening's party meeting, based on the reports of the conveners of the various review committees of the constitutional draft, some resolutions were made. I am now ordered to make the following statement: (1) Today, the first review committee of the constitutional draft amended Article 1 of Chapter 1 of the constitutional draft to "The Republic of China is a democratic republic based on the Three Principles of the People," and our party representative immediately made a written statement reserving the opinions of the minority. (2) Today, the third review committee of the constitutional draft added the four characters "emergency events" to Article 44 of Chapter 4 of the constitutional draft, and our party representative immediately stated that the opinions of the minority party would be reserved and submitted to the Comprehensive Review Committee to request military payment for voting. If the opinions of the minority party cannot be respected and considered by the majority party, then our party will consider appropriate measures to participate in the constitution-making work." Jiang also said: "The third party people's news said that a small number of leaders of our party advocated implementing the Qing Party, which is absolutely not the case."

### The Stormy Waters of the Review Committee

— Our Reporter

——Arguments, Withdrawals, and News Reporters Blocked

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 11th] During the First Review Committee's discussion of Article One, a point raised regarding Ying Wugong's actions caused a huge uproar, with members of the Youth Party almost walking out. Min Da, Zhou Dou San, and others, wearing hats and carrying books, prepared to leave, but were dissuaded by other representatives. Li Junfu of the Democratic Socialist Party, who had requested to withdraw yesterday, again threatened to leave today because the representatives would not allow him to report, but was persuaded to stay by those nearby.

When discussing whether sovereignty belonged to the "people" or the "nation," a certain Guangdong representative and Wu Jingxiong had a lengthy discussion about the Queen of England, and Chen Guyuan spoke at length about the source of sovereignty, leading some to say that the meeting resembled a "Comparative Constitutional Law" class at a university.

Jiang Wanping's remarks were the most amusing. He said, "We are attending the National Assembly as representatives of the nation, so why does the constitution use 'people' instead of 'nation'?" The audience burst into laughter.

Representative Wu Yanhuan said that territory must never be changed, and if there is any further loss of land, the ancestors in the afterlife will surely scold us for "not being good sons."

Female representative Guo Changhe shouted, opposing the enumerated method of defining territory, saying, "We must also recover our past lands, such as Hong Kong, and the national territory cannot be forfeited by this National Assembly!"

When the Second Review Committee convened, there was another "extensive discussion." Kong Geng spoke for over ten minutes, and Youth Party representative Zhu Ruixi stood up to ask Chairman Zhang Qiang to pay attention to speaking time. Old Man Kong was greatly angered, and his dozen or so cronies jumped up, rushing from all directions to surround Zhu's seat, pointing fingers and verbally attacking him, like a punitive expedition, almost resorting to violence. Chairman Zhang loudly called for "order," finally suppressing the situation of all-out fighting. With the sympathy of the majority, Representative Zhu sat silently for a while and then withdrew from the meeting. Old Man Kong again jumped onto the stage and said, "Just now, because a certain representative interfered with my right to speak, it caused chaos. This is truly a case of 'one dog barks at a shadow, and a hundred dogs bark in response'..." The audience listened with unease, and he began to deliver his "grand pronouncements" with head-shaking gestures.

Article 45 of the Presidential Chapter, regarding the President's power to convene meetings of the heads of relevant departments to resolve inter-departmental disputes, was already debated in the Political Consultative Conference's Constitution Drafting Review Committee, and the Democratic Socialist Party ultimately conceded. Unexpectedly, differing opinions arose again among the Kuomintang representatives in the Third Review Committee. Wang Shijie and Luo Ding advocated for deletion, while Pan Gongzhan advocated for retention. After a vote, the original proposal was maintained by a majority of forty-four votes, and Pan won the battle.

Representative He Fuqing from the Henan region again made a clever remark about a "prospective president," saying how it should be done. Representative Zhang Ziyang from Hebei immediately stood up, saying, "I oppose this representative's opinion. There is no need for a 'prospective president.' If we are going to elect a 'prospective president,' then we can also elect a 'honorary president' and so on!" As a result, it was put to a vote. The first time, only He himself voted in favor of the "prospective president." The second time, Li Jingzhai, who originally proposed the motion, smiled and raised his hand, and the clever proposal for a "prospective president" was declared over.

The First National Defense and Foreign Affairs Subcommittee of the Seventh Review Committee suddenly refused reporters' attendance this morning. The reporter asked, "Is this a secret meeting? If so, we won't intrude." The "Military Police Lord" replied, "Don't you know? In any case, you are not allowed to enter." "Would it be alright for us to ask the staff?" "No, no news reporters are allowed to enter this door." "Then whose order is it? The platoon leader? The battalion commander? The section chief?" "None of them, it's the 'Higher Up'." Upon asking their "Higher Up," it turned out to be Chairman Leng Xin's silent order. After inquiring about the content of the discussion, it seemed very ordinary. No one could say it was a "national defense secret" or a "foreign affairs secret."

When Kong Geng was getting angry, Lai Lian came out from the Education and Culture Subcommittee meeting and stood in the lobby, observing. He smiled and shook his head. When the reporter looked at him, he quickly went back to the meeting.

Before the issue of the national capital was raised in the First Review Committee this afternoon, the whole audience applauded enthusiastically, as if it were before the start of a good show. Zhang Pu's long speech garnered more than thirty rounds of applause, like Mei Lanfang's final act. The dispute between those who advocated for Beijing and those who advocated for Nanjing was like a Peking opera and Shanghai opera singing against each other on the same stage, and finally, the whole thing was capped off with a dispute over a female representative leaving the meeting, almost resulting in a full-scale fight, from beginning to end, very much like a "Grand Variety Show."

When discussing the issue of the national capital, the representatives spoke extensively about geographical terms and historical lessons, a stark contrast to their earlier discussions about "sovereignty" and "national rights." One representative said that the morning felt like attending a constitutional law class, and the afternoon felt like attending a geography and history class.

Zhang Jiyan spearheaded the charge for the Beijing faction, speaking fluently and with great familiarity with place names. He believed that if there were no problems with the national capital, it would not need to be stipulated. Since there was a problem, it had to be explicitly stipulated. He also said that some people opposed returning the capital due to economic difficulties, but this reason was as insufficient as not convening the National Assembly due to economic difficulties.

Qiu Bie, a respected figure from Hunan, did not advocate for establishing the capital in Changsha but advocated for establishing the capital in Xi'an. He believed that for the sake of the overall situation, the most difficult and challenging location should be chosen, and the capital should not be established in Nanjing or Beijing, which are comfortable places for "eating, drinking, and procreation" and have spacious houses.

When elder statesman Zhang Pu spoke for over fifteen minutes, he first stated that "I am not trying to show off my intelligence." He said that as far as he knew, establishing the capital in Nanjing was not Dr. Sun Yat-sen's original intention. Dr. Sun's advocacy for establishing the capital in Nanjing was a temporary idea, not a permanent one. Finally, he pointed out solemnly that if the capital were to be established in Nanjing again, it would inevitably lead to national demise. The applause after his speech lasted for a long time.

Lai Jianjun, a representative from Chongqing, spoke in a strong Sichuan accent, hoping that people would not forget the wartime capital of Chongqing. Lai said sadly that Chongqing had been bombed by the enemy for years but never succumbed, and the words "wartime capital" were written in blood.

Wu Yanhuan, who opposed establishing the capital in Nanjing, said, "If Dr. Sun Yat-sen were still alive today, he would surely advocate for establishing the capital in Beijing." The whole audience burst into laughter. He opposed establishing the capital in Nanjing because Dr. Sun's mausoleum was in Nanjing. He said, "The ancestor of the Chinese nation is the Yellow Emperor, and his mausoleum is far away in a desolate county in central Shaanxi. Should we not establish the capital in central China because of that? Some say that moving the capital to Hualin is actually just to escape to Lushan for summer, and the money spent on that is not insignificant either."

Liu Baimin delivered the final act, strongly advocating for establishing the capital in Nanjing. His most brilliant remark was that today is the 11th, and the day after tomorrow is the 13th, the day of the Nanjing Massacre by the Japanese. How many compatriots died for Nanjing to be the capital? Nanjing became the capital with blood. Another representative also pointed out that although Nanjing was not able to defend itself for long during the War of Resistance, the fall of Beijing came before the fall of Nanjing. Therefore, Nanjing should not be denied the position of capital because it was once lost.

### The Chinese Communists Openly Launch Internal Rebellion, Lin Zuhan Calls for Mobilization of Soldiers and Civilians in Communist Areas, Communist Troops Gradually Lose Ground in Street Fighting in Yancheng, Northern Jiangsu

[United Press, Nanjing, 11th] Xinhua North News Agency reports: Lin Zuhan, Chairman of the Yan'an Border Region Government, recently called on all Communist soldiers and civilians to mobilize and participate in the "Defense of Yan'an." Lin requested that the entire region enter a state of combat from a state of bloody battle, rise up together, and "defend the fortress." He urged everyone to recognize the spirit of "everything for the front line" and work hard to assist the front-line troops in annihilating Hu Zongnan's forces. Lin said that in the past month, the National Army had concentrated large forces on the border of Yan'an, constantly making probing attacks on the border region, but all had been repelled.

[Reuters, Nanjing, 11th] After the National Army stormed into the south gate of Yancheng in northern Jiangsu, street fighting is still ongoing, and a tug-of-war situation has developed over the past 48 hours. Communist troops are still entrenched in the east and west gates, stubbornly resisting, but are gradually showing signs of collapse.

[Our Tiejiang Dispatch, 11th] The battle in northern Jiangsu is coming to an end. The National Army, advancing in multiple directions from Huaiyin, Suyu, Sicheng, and Dongtai, and dividing its forces to attack Suqian, Shuyang, Yancheng, and Funing, is now using its overwhelming military strength to protect the return of civilians to their hometowns in the aforementioned areas. The momentum is unprecedented. According to qualified sources in the military, the Communist forces in Yancheng and Funing have now been isolated, and the Communist forces in Lianshui and Shuyang are also vulnerable to attack. The situation in northern Jiangsu can definitely be clarified within this year. The fighting in Yancheng is still fierce today, and the Communist commander Xu Xiangqian is personally supervising the battle, attempting to defend it to the death.

[Our Taixian Dispatch, 11th] The Communist troops recently drew a large number of main forces from Lianshui and concentrated them near Yancheng, harassing the National Army positions at Liuzhuang. Another part of the force crossed Liuzhuang and moved south, possibly attempting to invade Dongtai. Currently, the Communist forces in the Jianfuning area include the entire First Division, the 30th Brigade, the 31st Brigade, the 13th Brigade, the Yancheng-Funing Independent Brigade, the Central China Special Service Regiment, the Second Jiangsu Sub-Regiment, and other local troops, totaling more than 40 regiments. The National Army is on high alert.

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 11th] Military news: The National Army, which is advancing from Huaiyin towards Lianshui and Shuyang, has made further progress after recovering Xiaowuji. Another route of the National Army simultaneously cut off the connection between the Communist forces in Shuyang and Funing. The Communist forces in Yancheng, after being severely attacked by Li's unit of the National Army, no longer have any ability to resist, and the city can be recovered today or tomorrow. It is also reported that the Yancheng Party and government organs are also advancing with the army.

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 11th] It is learned that after the National Army crossed the Liutang River yesterday, it has recovered Qianjiaji, which belongs to Shuyang County, again today. In addition, Communist troops in the Haishu area have been carrying weapons and surrendering to the National Army in Xinpu one after another in recent weeks.

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 11th] Political news: The Jiangsu Provincial Government ordered the governments of Yancheng, Funing, Lianshui, and Shuyang counties a week ago to prepare to cooperate with the National Army's demobilization at any time, appease the displaced, and expedite relief and rehabilitation. It is reported that Yancheng and Funing counties have suffered the most damage, and there are more than 500,000 refugees awaiting rescue. There is an urgent need for 1 billion yuan in relief funds and a large amount of cotton clothing, because the cotton clothing of the people in these two counties has been requisitioned by the Communist troops, leaving the people with only hemp cloth mourning clothes to get through the winter, and their situation is extremely miserable.

### Yan'an Military Conference Decides on Internal Rebellion Plan, Attempting to Rebuild Six Base Areas

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 11th] According to someone familiar with the inside story of the Communist army, after learning that the government had decided to convene the National Assembly as scheduled, the Yan'an side convened a military conference in Yan'an on the 10th of last month, and its resolutions for implementation are as follows: (1) In the Jiangnan area, Chen Yi of the New Fourth Army will be responsible for carrying out field operations, first threatening Nanjing and Shanghai to shake people's hearts, and making every effort to maintain the northern Jiangsu area and seize the Shanghai sea and land transportation routes to ensure the connection with central China. (2) In the Northeast region, Lin Biao will be responsible for using the name of the Democratic Allied Army to call on the masses, and then cut off the Beining Road, occupy various seaports, such as Huludao, Qinhuangdao, and their surrounding areas, to isolate the National Army in the Northeast. (3) In the North China region, every effort should be made to seal off the cities, shrink the encirclement, destroy transportation, and collect supplies, and to carry out piecemeal annihilation through mobile warfare. (4) Re-establish six base areas, including the Sichuan-Shaanxi Border Region, the Henan-Hubei-Anhui Border Region, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Border Region, the Sichuan-Hunan Border Region, the Guizhou-Guangxi Border Region, and the Qiongya Island Region.

### Communist Troops in the Northeast to Launch General Offensive, Spreading Sand on Ice in Preparation for Crossing the River, Press-Ganging Laborers and Seizing Grain, People Flee in All Directions

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 11th] Military news: The attempt by the Communist troops in the Northeast to cross the Songhua River and launch a general offensive towards Changchun is becoming increasingly obvious. An arc-shaped defense line has been formed along the north bank of the Songhua River, and a large amount of sand has been stored in Taolaizhao, Wujia Station, and other places, which is being spread on the ice in multiple routes to facilitate crossing the river.

[Our Changchun Dispatch, 10th] Military news: (1) The Communist troops gathered near Wujia Station are very busy preparing for war, requisitioning large carts and stretchers from the people every day, and press-ganging laborers and seizing grain. The people are fleeing in all directions, and the countryside is very desolate. (2) The Communist troops have recently concentrated 50,000 troops from the Yanji and Mudanjiang areas to Dunhua, showing signs of moving south. (3) The Communist troops have established a trade bureau in Yanji, specializing in seizing materials from the National Army areas.

### Communist Troops Destroy Historical Sites, Ming Tombs Dismantled and Transported Away

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] Since the Thirteen Tombs of the Ming Dynasty in Beiping County were occupied by the Communist troops, the Kang Tomb, Zhao Tomb, Xian Tomb, Tai Tomb, and Mao Tomb have all had their original palaces dismantled. The nanmu pillars have been transported and sold, and the pine and cypress trees have been felled and burned. The architecture of the Ming Tombs is grand and large in scale, and they are famous historical sites. Before the war, the government repeatedly ordered their protection, and tourists from abroad also came to visit in an endless stream. Now that they have been destroyed by the Communist troops, the losses are extremely heavy. The Hebei Provincial Government has, in addition to forwarding the matter to the Beiping Military Mediation Department to request that measures be taken to stop this, also sent a telegram to the Executive Yuan to request instructions on how to deal with the matter.

### Counterfeit Weighing Scales and Weights, Embezzling Two Tons of Food, Head of Guilin Storage and Transportation Station Arrested

[Our Guilin Dispatch, 11th] The Guilin Storage and Transportation Station of the Guilin Branch of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) counterfeited weighing scales and weights, using tin blocks to increase the size of the weights, embezzling a total of two tons of food. After reports from various parties, the person in charge, Jiang Yuancheng, has been arrested and is awaiting interrogation.

### Director of UNRRA Henan Branch Reports that Yellow River Closure Will Be Completed, UNRRA Representative Says Flood Area Situation is Terrible

[Our Report] Ma Jie, Director of the UNRRA Henan Branch, UNRRA representative Mr. West, and Song Tong, Director of Construction of Henan Province, gave a joint press conference at UNRRA yesterday afternoon to report on the progress of the Yellow River flood area restoration project. Mr. West gave the report first, saying: The Yellow River closure project is about to be completed, but the ultimate goal of the closure is to restore the old course and revive the Yellow River flood area, so that the people in the area can live and work in peace. Ma also described the three reasons why UNRRA is so eager to expedite the repair of the breach: (1) The breach was caused by the war, and now that the war is over, the refugees should no longer be displaced and should be stabilized as soon as possible; (2) If repairs are not expedited at this time, some of the good farmland in the area will no longer be able to produce and will become barren; (3) The land on both sides of the Yellow River is fertile and suitable for cultivation. If it is not remedied, the food supply in the area will be quite problematic. After the repair is completed, the area can be used as a test site for mechanized farming. However, this work is not easy, and problems such as child welfare and traffic sanitation are difficult to solve.

According to Mr. West, the situation in the Yellow River flood area is terrible. This kind of great flood only occurred in the Roman era in world history, and it took two thousand years to manage it. The complexity of the US TVA can be compared to the Yellow River, but its social situation is not as complicated as China's. Mr. West reported the results of the survey of the Yellow River flood area: the area covers a total of 16.5 million mu, of which 7.5 million mu are in Henan Province, and 990,000 mu of land are covered with weeds and need to be re-arranged before they can be cultivated. At the same time, according to a survey, Fugou County in the area had a population of 320,000 in 1938, but only 44,000 remained a year and a half ago. Most of the remaining population had fled, were scattered, or died in the disaster. Currently, it has increased to 140,000 people, all of whom are returning home from various places, at a rate of 500 people per week. However, there is still no way to solve the problem of food, clothing, and shelter after returning home.

Finally, Song Tong reported that the Henan Provincial Government is extremely concerned about this disaster and has specially organized a guidance committee to assist returning residents in carrying out various affairs and to find ways to solve land ownership problems. After receiving relief supplies from UNRRA, the committee has made great progress in promoting its work.

### Dong Biwu's Remarks

Pointing Out Unfair Distribution of Relief Supplies

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 11th] Dong Biwu spoke to reporters on the evening of the 11th regarding the distribution of relief supplies: (1) Of the 15 UNRRA branches nationwide, 8 are related to Communist areas, accounting for 69% of the population, but their distribution of relief supplies is only 10% of what they should receive, which is really unfair. Mr. Ray, the former head of the UNRRA office in China, also said that this ratio is a "bad conclusion." Jiang Tingfu and Ray had intended to improve it but failed. The current new director, Eggerton, also intends to improve it, and Huo Doushu has repeatedly stated that there should be no discrimination due to party affiliation, but the unfair phenomenon has been established. The news report quoted Huo Doushu as making three points, believing that the reason why the distribution to the Communist areas is less is because most of the supplies shipped are food, while the Communist areas are producing areas, which does not correspond to the facts. For example, the Jin-Chahar-Hebei area only produces black beans, while the Hunan-Jiangxi area is a grain-producing area, but there is still a distribution of relief supplies, so this matter should be carefully handled. (2) More than 30 tons of heavy machinery from UNRRA do not need to be distributed to the Communist areas. In fact, there is still some light machinery that has not been distributed either. (3) Regarding the Yellow River closure, the Communist area has completed the project, and UNRRA has inspected it, but the dangerous parts cannot be done due to lack of funds.

### Cotton Clothes Thin and Rotten, How Can They Resist the Cold?

Hankou Poor People March in Protest

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 11th] More than 300 poor people in Hankou protested to the relevant authorities yesterday because the winter clothes issued by the local relief branch were all thin and rotten and could not be used. They hung the torn clothes they received on the tops of bamboo poles and marched on Zhongshan Avenue with the words "Thank you to the Relief Branch" written on them. For a time, the spectators were as crowded as walls.

### US Establishes Consulate in Harbin, Rejected by the Chinese Communists

[United Press, Nanjing, 11th] Communist spokesman Wang Bingnan officially notified the US Embassy this afternoon that, on orders from Yan'an, the Communist Party will refuse the entry of Mr. Clubb, the US Consul General appointed to Harbin, on the grounds that the area is a military zone. He also said that if it were peacetime, Mr. Clubb would have been allowed to go. When asked if Yan'an's rejection of the US Consul's entry into Harbin was related to the Communist Party's usual accusation that the United States was aiding the government, he replied that Yan'an had not responded in that way.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 10th] The State Department today confirmed reports that the Chinese Communists would prevent the US government from establishing a consulate in Harbin. A State Department spokesman said that US Consul General Clubb had waited patiently for eight months for the Communist side to allow him to go to Harbin to establish a consulate, but because he was ultimately not granted permission by the Communist side, he is currently still performing his consular duties in Changchun.

### Several Issues Related to Elections in the Draft Constitution

— Our Reporter Yu Zhenji

(III) Women and Overseas Chinese

According to Article 129 of the draft constitution, "Citizens of the Republic of China who are 20 years of age or older have the right to vote in accordance with the law. Unless otherwise stipulated in this Constitution and the law, those who are 23 years of age or older have the right to be elected in accordance with the law." Chapter 2, Article 8 also stipulates that "Citizens of the Republic of China are equal under the law regardless of gender..." However, there are still some issues related to women in the proposals regarding elections this time.

Representative Chen Guyuan and 62 others proposed adding a proviso to Article 130, which states that "Candidates for all elections stipulated in this Constitution shall compete openly": "However, regarding the election of representatives to the National Assembly and members of the Legislative Yuan and Control Yuan, the minimum number of women to be elected should be stipulated by law." Their reasoning is that in today's patriarchal society, men will inevitably win in open competition between men and women. Therefore, in past cases in our country, the minimum number of women to be elected has been stipulated to avoid the idea of gender equality becoming a mere name. The British Parliament also has provisions for women. Representative Wei Tingsheng and 52 others proposed in Proposal No. 86 to add "representatives elected by women's organizations" under Article 26, "The National Assembly is organized by the following national representatives." They believe that this can prevent women from being disadvantaged when competing with men, and that "women's problems must be solved by women."

The recently deceased female representative Liu Chunyit she also proposed with Ni Guifu and 33 other representatives to add after Article 130, "In all candidate lists stipulated by party law, the number of women shall not be less than 30%." This is more concrete than Chen Guyuan's proposal. As for why it is stipulated to be 30% or more, the original proposal does not explain.

Another issue related to elections in the 100 proposals this time is whether overseas Chinese have the right to elect members of the Control Yuan. According to the provisions of Article 26, Item 2 and Article 95 of the draft constitution, overseas Chinese do not have the right to elect members of the Control Yuan. There are four proposals for supplementation proposed by Chen Shuren and others, and their reasons are as follows: (1) Article 65 of the draft constitution stipulates the allocation of seats in the Legislative Yuan, including the item of "citizens residing abroad," while the allocation of seats in the Control Yuan lacks this item, so it should be added; (2) Overseas Chinese are straightforward and dare to speak out, and are good at impeachment and oversight; (3) According to the provisions of Article 26, members of the Control Yuan and members of the Legislative Yuan have the same qualifications, that is, they simultaneously have the qualifications of representatives to the National Assembly. Therefore, their method of selection should be the same as that of other members of the Legislative Yuan, that is, directly elected by the people. However, the members of the Control Yuan stipulated in Article 26, Item 2 and Article 96 are exceptions, and are determined to be indirectly elected by the parliament. This is a case of different natures being treated differently by law, so it is advocated that all should be directly elected by the people.

In addition to the above issues, the election issues involved in the proposals also include (1) direct elections versus indirect elections, (2) whether representatives to the National Assembly have the right to elect important officials other than the president and vice president, (3) whether current officials in active duty can participate in the election of representatives to the National Assembly before being dismissed or approved, (4) the age of electors and those elected, (5) the election of representatives to the National Assembly in municipalities directly under the central government, etc. It is believed that these issues will be hotly debated in the review committee.

### Another Incident Occurs in Hanoi: Five Overseas Chinese Shot Dead; Conflicts Between French and Vietnamese Continue, Causing Displacement of Overseas Chinese

[Agence France-Presse, Hanoi, 10th] Since the 23rd of last month, railway and highway traffic from Hanoi to Haiphong has been interrupted and has not yet resumed. Consequently, transportation issues have become the most critical problem at present. An aerial survey revealed that the highway has been damaged at several points, and many railway tracks are also destroyed and unusable. Therefore, the only means of transportation between Hanoi and Haiphong is by air, resulting in the inability to transport heavy goods, European food, and newly arrived luggage from France. Furthermore, it has been learned that an incident occurred again tonight approximately ten kilometers northeast of Hanoi. It is reported that five overseas Chinese were shot dead by Vietnamese, further escalating tensions between the overseas Chinese and the Vietnamese people.

[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 10th] French-Vietnamese Military Conflict in Haiphong: Viewing Chinese as Neutral, as of yesterday, investigations have revealed that over 800 overseas Chinese have been killed, injured, gone missing, or been arrested. Property losses are estimated at over 29 million Vietnamese currency units. Displacement is widespread, and the situation is heartbreaking. The atmosphere of violence has spread to various parts of Hanoi. The French side is determined to resolve the Vietnamese situation by force, while the Vietnamese side insists that French troops must return to their original garrison areas in Haiphong and Lang Son as they were before November 20th before negotiations can begin. Both sides are taking extreme positions, sharpening their swords and preparing for imminent conflict. There has been no concrete solution to our request for the demarcation of a neutral zone and effective protection of overseas Chinese.

### Compensation for Wartime Losses of Private Factories; Industrial Associations to Participate in the Committee for Japanese Reparations

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] Two matters, namely, compensation for wartime losses of private factories in our country and the participation of the Industrial Association in the Committee for Japanese Reparations, have been approved by the authorities. Representatives from the China National Federation of Industries and the Shanghai Industrial Association, including Chairman Wu Yun-chu, Executive Directors Hu Bo-xiang, Jin Run-xiang, and Tang Xu-zhi, met with Deputy Executive Yuan President Weng Wen-hao and Economic Affairs Department Director Wu Cheng-luo and Chief Secretary Xu Bai-qi on the 11th to decide on these matters. Deputy Executive Yuan President Weng Wen-hao personally assured that wartime losses of private factories would be compensated by the Executive Yuan and relevant departments. The China National Federation of Industries will also be able to send representatives to participate in the Committee for Japanese Reparations to facilitate the handling of Japanese reparations to our country. Weng Wen-hao also entrusted the Industrial Association to collect data on wartime losses of private factories nationwide for the government's reference. The four representatives, considering that the purpose of their petition had been achieved, except for Wu Yun-chu who remained in Nanjing to attend the National Assembly, all returned to Shanghai the following day.

### The Municipal Budget for the Next Year

The revenue listed in the municipal budget for the 36th year of the Republic is 210,193,981,125 yuan. The total expenditure is 523,675,917,990 yuan, resulting in a deficit of 313,481,936,775 yuan. This deficit figure is already shocking. It is heard that after consultations between the municipal government, the actual revenue figure is only 190,800,000,000 yuan. Moreover, items such as housing tax and banquet tax are still estimated based on the current tax rates, without adopting the standards stipulated by the central government. Therefore, according to the most conservative estimate, the revenue is said to be only 110 billion yuan. In that case, the deficit would be over 410 billion yuan, exceeding the actual revenue by about three times and exceeding the revenue agreed upon by the municipal government by more than one time!

The municipal government's solution is to adopt the principle of living within its means, which means calculating roughly double the budget for the second half of this year, totaling 214,017,433,470 yuan, and then making appropriate cuts to reach the hypothetical figure of 190.8 billion yuan. New items that need to be handled will be included in a separate budget, and separate sources of funding will be planned. In other words, things will be done if there is money, and not done if there is no money; as much will be done as there is money. It is heard that the target of this new source of funding is likely to be government bonds.

As the saying goes, "Even a skilled housewife cannot cook without rice." With only so much money, naturally, only so many things can be done. The municipal government has not tried to find all possible ways to raise funds this time, but has very realistically maintained the status quo, adhering to the principle of living within its means, which is, on the whole, worthy of sympathy.

Currently, the finances of various regions are all suffering deficits. There are naturally many complex reasons for this, but the idea of revitalizing everything, trying to embellish as much as possible, and supporting the façade in many ways is, in fact, the main cause of the deficits and their expansion. The reason is that the heads of various departments, driven by a sense of responsibility, naturally want to do as much as possible within the scope of their responsibilities, holding the ambition of doing everything at the same time. Coupled with the instructions of superior agencies, the resolutions of long-term agencies, and the suggestions from various parties, they cannot but deal with things separately and advance on multiple fronts at the same time. Therefore, the important factor of finance is relegated to a secondary position. To reverse this trend and make up for the budget shortfall, apart from the highest officials of various ministries or localities making overall plans based on the time and place, weighing the priorities, there is no other way. For example, this time the revenue of Shanghai is limited to 190.8 billion yuan, while the expenditure required to maintain the status quo is 214 billion yuan. Looking at the figures, it seems that revenue and expenditure are still insufficient. In fact, the budgets made by various units in the first place (for the second half of the 35th year of the Republic) were not very realistic. Originally, when compiling the expenditure and policy plans, they wanted to do as many things as possible and ask for as much money as possible. However, when the budget was finalized, due to various reasons, the planned work could not be started, so many funds were frozen in the treasury and could not be withdrawn. According to someone in the know, the operational expenses of a certain agency that had not been spent amounted to one-third. If this is reliable, then doubling the expenses for the second half of this year to serve as the expenditure budget for the next year still needs to be discounted, because while this is ostensibly maintaining the status quo, it still carries some idealism.

The Legislative Yuan recently separately discussed and resolved that the tax rates for housing tax and banquet tax, etc., are much lower than those currently in effect in this city. At a time when the city's finances are suffering a huge deficit, if we were to say that taxes should be collected according to the central government's tax rates, it would seem like we are joking with the municipal financial authorities and being too unsympathetic. In fact, this concerns the spirit of the rule of law, not just a matter of a few dollars. If revenue is indeed insufficient after reducing taxes in accordance with the law, our ideal is that we would rather seek other legitimate new sources of funding to compensate, rather than openly disregard the central government's laws.

We must also admit that the difference of these few dollars is not enough to excessively affect the municipal budget. What will most severely affect the municipal budget in the future is prices, not a partial reduction in taxes. If prices continue to rise sharply next year, and civil servants' salaries still need to be adjusted every three months as usual, and various construction materials, purchases, repairs, and other expenses must be increased at any time, then the originally planned 5% reserve fund and the 36 billion yuan for adjusting living allowances will probably still be insufficient.

Therefore, in peaceful times, the figures in the budget are indeed worthy of attention. In this extraordinary time of economic hardship, rather than meticulously calculating the equality of revenue and expenditure, it is more practical to stabilize prices and resolve the crisis in industry and commerce. Looking at the revenue table of our city, business tax, license tax, wharf dues, etc., are certainly closely related to the prosperity and decline of the market. Even other taxes such as slaughter tax, banquet and entertainment tax, stockade tax, all kinds of fees, public business income, housing tax, and construction tax levied on public utilities, etc., are all closely related to the market. Therefore, the accuracy of our city's budget for next year lies not in the estimated figures at present, but in the changes in prices and the market.

### Improper Verdict in the Shibuya Incident; Our Representatives Express Objections; Investigation of Responsibility of Japanese Police Should Be Conducted

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 10th] The 36 compatriots arrested in the Shibuya Incident were sentenced this afternoon after two and a half months of interrogation. Among them, two were acquitted and released, one was sentenced to three years of hard labor, and the other 33 were sentenced to two years of hard labor. The Taiwanese compatriots who were convicted will be deported and will not be allowed to return to Japan during the Allied occupation. Qiu Jun, the Chinese member of the international tribunal, who formed a three-person committee with two American and French judges to be responsible for reviewing the Shibuya case, immediately raised an objection after the verdict. Qiu forcefully stated: "The prosecution has not been able to prove the guilt of the defendants beyond a reasonable doubt. This committee should make a decision to dismiss the plaintiff's lawsuit and acquit the defendants." Qiu's objection immediately raised the question of whether the verdict was appropriate, as the three-person committee only obtained a two-thirds vote to convict the defendants. It is reported that the head of our delegation to Japan, General Zhu Shiming, and Shen Guanding will visit the American Acheson to discuss the verdict of the Shibuya case. Shen will also raise the issue of the responsibility of the Japanese police in the shooting incident on July 19, as the defendants have consistently denied the responsibility of firing the first shot in the incident that resulted in the death of six Taiwanese compatriots and the injury of more than 20. When the Japanese police testified in court, they stated that they had used as many as 542 bullets in the incident. According to the chairman of the three-person committee, the case will be submitted to the occupation authorities for review. After the Shibuya incident occurred, our delegation in Japan has consistently insisted on conducting a complete and fair investigation. The continuous efforts of our representatives are aimed at ensuring that the Taiwanese compatriots receive a fair trial and that the responsibility of both parties involved in the conflict can be clarified. However, the investigation of the responsibility of the Japanese police has not yet been completed.

### National Army Demobilization Plan Affected by Political Situation

Huang Jie's Remarks to Reporters Yesterday

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 11th] General Huang Jie, acting head of the Central Training Corps, which is responsible for training demobilized army officers for employment, stated today during a reception for journalists that the National Army's strength is currently about 150 divisions after completing the first phase of the demobilization plan from January to September this year. General Huang also revealed that the speed of the National Army's demobilization has been greatly reduced due to the ongoing civil war and unstable political situation. The second phase of demobilization, which was originally planned to begin after the completion of the first phase, is still in the planning stage, but has in fact been postponed indefinitely. Huang stated that according to the original plan and the provisions of the National-Communist Army Reorganization Agreement, the army should be reduced to 90 divisions after the completion of the second phase of demobilization, and finally to 60 divisions by the end of next year.

### Gang of Thieves Cracked Down in Bengbu; Bandits Recruit Followers Under False Pretenses, Appointing Themselves Battalion Commanders and Engaging in Fraud

[This newspaper, Bengbu News] Since Bengbu City implemented winter defense measures, military and police security agencies have been stepping up patrols day and night. However, robbery cases still occur frequently. Chen Yi's family in Huangshanbao, West City District, was robbed at night, and Chen's father, Zhao Hui, was strangled to death. The Lao Fengxiang and Lao Tiandou silver shops were robbed of gold jewelry in broad daylight, demonstrating the rampant nature of the bandits. Recently, during the military and police investigation of bandits, a case of falsely using names, colluding with bandits, and secretly organizing convoys was cracked. The arrest of fake regiment commander He Dongshan and more than a dozen suspects has dealt a major blow to the bandit gangs that threaten security. The following is a detailed account of the case, according to the investigation: A bandit named He Dongshan had long colluded with bandits in the Hongze area of eastern Anhui, intending to use them for his own purposes. Someone introduced him to a person named Zhu Jiannong, who claimed to be a senior advisor to the Ministry of National Defense, often wearing a major general insignia and certificate, traveling between Nanjing and Bengbu, and appearing to be a high-ranking military officer. He Dongshan, Zhu Wei, and others colluded with him, openly recruiting bandits from Tianji'an in Hongze Lake, organizing them into the 7th and 8th Regiments of the Anhui Security Force, and appointing He Dongshan as the commander of the 7th Regiment, Cao Gan-chen as the commander of the 1st Battalion, Gu Yan as the commander of the 2nd Battalion, Zhu Wei as the commander of the 3rd Battalion, Shi Shurong as the commander of the 8th Regiment, and Zhang Yun-cheng as the deputy commander. The main cadres were mostly decided internally. He and others set up a secret agency at No. 526, Er Ma Road, Bengbu. Those who were accustomed to miscellaneous troops and had relations with the authorities flocked to it, gathering in the agency from time to time, with their actions being secretive and their activities very vigorous. Li Bo-ying, who had participated in puppet organizations and served as a puppet army detachment commander during the enemy and puppet occupation, also participated in the activities. Before long, He Dongshan was arrested by the police bureau on suspicion of being a bandit. The position of commander of the puppet 7th Regiment was temporarily held by Zhang Yun-cheng. Zhang, Li, and others continued to operate secretly, boasting everywhere, attracting bandits, and claiming to organize a security regiment, plotting wrongdoing. This was learned by the intelligence team of the political department of the 8th Pacification District. They notified the Bengbu garrison to investigate. The team sent squad leader Zhang Huayu, disguised as an associate, to infiltrate the puppet battalion commander Zhu Wei's place, pretending to join in the plan. After Zhang's investigation for half a month, he fully understood the truth of the bandit gang falsely using names and numbers. So he secretly reported to the military police and cracked down on the puppet agency, arresting bandits Zhang Yun-cheng, Shi Shurong, Cao Gan-chen, Li Bo-ying, Li Xing-ya, Zhang Zhi-wu, Zhu Wei, Yan Jun-kui, Sun Jian-tang, and 19 suspects in total.

### Suzhou Industries Struggle to Survive the Year-End; Banks Agree to Lend 5 Billion, Making Loans with the Lowest Interest Rates as Collateral

[This newspaper, Suzhou, 11th] The Suzhou County Chamber of Commerce, responding to the request of the Grain Industry Association, stated that as the end of the year approaches, business and the economy are as depleted as ever. If relief is not sought quickly, the wave of business closures by the end of the year will be even more severe than in the past. The current crisis is lurking on all sides and cannot be delayed. Therefore, on the 11th, it convened the chairmen of various industry associations and invited all state-owned and commercial banks in the county to discuss emergency relief measures.

### Suzhou City Councilor Election; Disputes Emerge from Beneath the Surface

[This newspaper, Suzhou, 11th] The preliminary election of city councilors from professional groups in this county has come to an end, with more than 200 candidates being produced for the runoff election. A formal election will be held at the end of this month to produce 43 county councilors. However, based on the views of various aspects of society, it is widely believed that the preliminary election preparations were insufficient and were held in haste. Therefore, there is no shortage of manipulation. Some member representatives of ten industry associations even reported in newspapers that they did not know how the winners of the preliminary election in their own groups were produced, and even did not know the date and location of the preliminary election. As a result, the tide of brewing disputes among various professional groups has become increasingly acute. Now, the Civil Shipping Industry Association has erupted, with member representatives Zhao Xiaosizi and others submitting a petition to the Provisional Council and the county government on the 11th, revealing that there was no prior notice given during the association's preliminary election. Therefore, the three runoff election candidates Wang Duanzhang, Zhu Zheng'an, and Chu Jinchun cannot be recognized as having legal qualifications. Moreover, Wang Duanzhang and others are currently being investigated by the county government for another case and are difficult to gain public trust. They requested a re-election, etc. The Provisional Council has now sent a letter to the county government for a detailed investigation to show that the election is serious.

### Newly Registered Households on the Chongming North Coast Are All Abolished; Years of Disputes May Come to an End

[This newspaper, Chongming News] In the past ten years, many newly accreted fields have emerged along the north coast of this county, with a total area of over 2,000 mu that can be cultivated. They are all fertile fields of exceptional quality. Some people paid the provincial government during the occupation of Chongming Island to register and receive ownership. Last autumn, the Japanese surrendered, and the country was restored. They jointly organized a reclamation agency, preparing to manage the land. However, the old households residing in the newly accreted area, holding old deeds for mudflat lands, claimed that the newly accreted sand fields were originally civilian lands that had collapsed into the sea and had been taxed for decades, with seals as proof. Therefore, the property rights of the land could not disappear. The two sides engaged in fierce disputes, lasting for more than a year. They presented their cases to the provincial and central government departments, but there were no concrete results. During the summer and autumn this year, the two sides engaged in armed conflicts, resulting in bloodshed and lawsuits. It has been learned that the county government has received an order from the provincial government to abolish all newly registered households who paid for registration during the occupation and to return the fees they paid. In the midst of calls for land system reform, this major case may be quickly resolved.

### Funding for the Qiantang River Seawall Repair Project Should Be Included in the National Budget; Zhejiang Province Is Unable to Bear the Cost Due to Economic Hardship; Two Department Heads Invite Relevant Central Government Officials to Discuss

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] Zhejiang Civil Affairs Department Director Ruan Yi-cheng and Construction Department Director Pi Zuo-qiong invited relevant central government departmental officials and representatives from Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Shanghai attending the National Assembly to discuss the repair of the Qiantang River seawall. It is reported that the central government approved 6 billion yuan for the Zhejiang seawall project for the second half of this year, of which 2.1 billion yuan will be allocated by the central government, 2 billion yuan will be allocated in relief materials by the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), and another 2 billion yuan will be borne by the people of Zhejiang. However, after the war, Zhejiang is in economic hardship and unable to bear the cost. It is requested that it all be allocated by the central government. The 11 billion yuan needed for next year is also proposed to be included in the national budget, as the Qiantang River seawall concerns the livelihoods of the people of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces and Shanghai City and is not a water conservancy project within a single province. Moreover, seawall repairs have always been funded by the state in the past, and the local people have never been required to bear the cost of the ancestors in addition to the labor force. Ruan and others also said that they hope to change the Seawall Works Bureau into a direct subordinate of the central government in order to increase efficiency and proceed actively.

### Bandit Sightings Frequent in Pinghu: Joint Defense Initiated by Four Counties

[Our Pinghu Correspondent] Following the change in weather, our county experienced two winter defense alarms in the past two days: (1) A kidnapping occurred in Baziqiao, where Yunping borders Jinshan County.

### Anti-Bandit Campaign in Zhejiang Province Nearing Completion: Over a Thousand Bandits Captured; Enhanced Transportation Protection During Winter Defense

[Our Hangzhou Correspondent, 11th] Zhejiang Deputy Security Commander Deng Mingqing reported on the anti-bandit campaign in Zhejiang Province. A total of 1,053 bandits have been captured, 198 surrendered, 251 were wounded or killed, and 76 short guns, 2 heavy machine guns, and 3 light machine guns, along with over 2,000 rounds of ammunition, were seized. Except for the borders of Su, Zhe, An, and Min provinces and coastal bandits, there are no bandit gangs of more than ten people in areas such as Siming Mountain, Kuaiji Mountain, Jiaojiang, and Yongle. However, bandits are like weeds, disappearing only to reappear, and the practice of dispersing and hiding among the people has not been eliminated. It is estimated that there are still over a thousand bandits, and the large number of unemployed and social unrest are the main causes. Only 269 stray soldiers and vagrants have been taken in, which is insufficient. Orders have been issued to intensify efforts. During the winter defense period, transportation protection will be strengthened, with armed village police organizing villages within 20 miles on both sides of the roads to guard and patrol sections. Mobile police duties will be undertaken by the National Army, and signal flares will be used to report bandit activity. Over 70,000 civilian firearms have been registered throughout the province, and there are over 25,000 police officers. With the combined efforts of civilians and police, there is no need to fear the winter defense.

### Commercial Slump and New Taxes Increase: Wuxi Business Community Requests Tax Relief

[Our Wuxi Correspondent] The guilds of seven industries in this county, including Chinese medicine, Western medicine, silk and cloth, printing, silver shops, food, and department stores, believe that the current commercial depression is a widespread phenomenon and that various expenses are difficult to list. Many businesses are struggling to survive, and business failures are happening one after another. Recently, the tax bureau has opened up regulations such as the collection of interest income tax, rental income tax, and salary income tax. Shops find it unbearable to bear these costs and are requesting relief. In particular, interest income tax is mostly due to merchants borrowing from households on a temporary basis for emergency needs. As for the interest already paid, it is impossible to recover the tax from households, so the merchants have to compensate for the payment. In addition, rental income tax has a similar structure with the current levy of property tax, and the tax amount is calculated on an annual basis instead of a monthly basis for this rental income tax collection, which is a very large rate. How can merchants and the public bear this loss? Furthermore, the salaries of employees in various shops are meager and far below the treatment of workers. If income tax is deducted, it will be even more difficult. Yesterday, a joint letter was sent to the Chamber of Commerce to forward to the authorities, expressing sympathy for the difficulties of merchants and requesting that the new taxes be temporarily suspended to alleviate the suffering of the people.

### A Police Officer Writes a Letter Expressing Grievances

First letter: We are all police officers standing in front of or downstairs of Guangshemen, and our families are suffering from the meager salaries we receive, suffering from cold and diseases... And what about us? Bravely running in the cold wind and rain, on icy and snowy ground, under the scorching sun, enduring and standing in our positions, what is it for? When there is a fire or bandits, we fight bravely, arresting... what is it for? A small number of conspirators want to create a tragedy using the vendor incident, and we use our own lives to protect the interests of the people, what is it for?

We certainly dare not claim credit, saying that we have fulfilled our responsibility, but we allow our families to suffer and complain, and we ourselves are enduring and struggling. In fact, it is because we want to take on part of the responsibility of a citizen to protect the security of society and the region, so although it is a little bitter, we feel a little comforted in spirit.

But some people say: "The police should serve the people, and should not have the psychology of managing the people." Is this not serving the people but managing the people? Should we serve bad elements or a small number of people, allowing them to disrupt or hinder the interests or security of the majority of people regardless of everything?

We shed blood for the benefit of the majority... I ask, who sympathizes with our burnt faces? Not only is there no sympathy or comfort, but we are subjected to slander from some people due to misunderstanding?

Gentlemen! Put yourself in our shoes and think about how angry and sad we would be, so we want to call out, we want to cry out, because we have been wronged? Because we have been subjected to unreasonable criticism, call out, cry out, and ask the wise gentlemen to give a little fair comfort! (A chief police officer representative from the Gaoqiao Police Station)

Second letter: I am a police officer, and also a loyal reader of your newspaper who must read it every day. In November, your newspaper published the good news of salary increases for civil servants, which tripled the original salary. But now I still only receive 101,500 yuan per month. Fair gentlemen; not only have we not received salary increases, but the five dou (a unit of volume) of yellow coarse rice that should be issued to us every month (October and November) has not been issued. With rising prices, how can a salary of 100,000 yuan allow the police to maintain their livelihoods? In addition, military blankets are distributed to high-ranking civil servants, but we have not only not received any, but we have also received no information. What is the authorities planning? The distribution is very nice to listen to, but each set requires 120,000 to 130,000 yuan. Please fair gentlemen think about it, if we buy a set, we would have to not eat for at least a month. Even if there are really cheap goods for distribution, where would we get the extra money to buy them? The police are the servants of the people, protecting the people's lives and property, allowing them to live and work in peace, but with our lives like this, fair gentlemen; give the police some sympathy! (Li Yaoxiang)

### Civil Servants Should Be Given Priority on Transportation

In September of this year, the City Council meeting and the case of free military rides for civil servants have not been implemented to this day. It is well known that civil servants are poorly paid, there is no need to say more. With only one or two shuttle buses every day, limited by time and routes, it is impossible to pick up and drop off all civil servants scattered everywhere. Therefore, the number of people who can enjoy these shuttle buses is extremely small. Most people take streetcars or public buses themselves. In today's high bus ticket prices, every civil servant feels this problem acutely. Fortunately, the British and French streetcar companies have preferential measures for civil servants to take the bus, selling monthly tickets at 10,000 yuan each, which greatly benefits the poor civil servants. However, in places where streetcar routes cannot reach, public buses of the Public Utility Bureau must be taken. Since public buses are operated by the city, they should be even more preferential, but the opposite is true. When officials from the city government and its subordinate bureaus take the bus, they must buy tickets in accordance with the regulations, without any reduction, while employees of foreign streetcar companies in the same industry are able to board the bus without issue and without purchasing a ticket under reciprocal conditions. Civil servants should of course abide by the law absolutely and must buy a ticket to take the bus. However, with prices rising endlessly and with monthly income of only over 100,000 yuan and the burden of family support on one's shoulders, the cost of transportation accounts for nearly one-third of the total income, how can one bear it? Public buses are vastly different in organization and nature from foreign streetcar organizations. They should do everything possible to obtain welfare for civil servants. We no longer foolishly imagine the implementation of free bus rides by the Council, but we only request the Public Utility Bureau to swiftly instruct the public bus company to sell monthly tickets to civil servants taking public buses, following the example of the streetcar company, starting in January. That would be a great favor! (A small civil servant)

### British Ships Detonated Mines in the Corfu Strait: Britain Sends an Ultimatum to Albania, Demanding an Apology and Guaranteeing No Recurrence of the Same Incident. Will Appeal to the Security Council if No Satisfactory Response Within Two Weeks

[Reuters, London, 10th] It was announced here tonight: The British government has issued a strongly worded ultimatum to the Albanian government regarding the unwarranted attack on British warships in the Corfu Strait, resulting in loss of life and property, requiring it to formally apologize to Britain within fourteen days and demanding compensation for damages. If a satisfactory response is not received, the British government will submit the matter to the Security Council. The first incident occurred on May 15, when the British cruiser "Orion" and the superclass number were fired upon by Albanian coastal batteries while passing through the Strait, but fortunately, they were not damaged. Then, on October 22, the British destroyers "Saumarez" and "Volage" were severely damaged by underwater mines in the Strait, with as many as 44 officers and soldiers killed. Between the two incidents, merchant ships were also shot at while passing through the area. The British government's note pointed out that British minesweepers cleared mines in the area in November and discovered that these mines were laid shortly before the British destroyers had their accident. From the perspective of Albania's strict coastal defense, there is no way the Albanian authorities would not have known that mines were laid in the Strait. Therefore, the British government suspects that these mines were either laid by Albania itself, or that the Albanian government must have known that there were mines laid. Therefore, the Albanian government has seriously violated international law. The British government now specifically requests that the Albanian government formally apologize to the British government for the successive attacks on British warships and guarantee that the same incident will not occur again. The British government also requests that the Albanian government compensate for the damage suffered by the British warships on October 22 and pay full compensation to the families of the 44 deceased officers and soldiers. If the Albanian government does not provide a satisfactory response within fourteen days of the delivery of the note, the British government will regard Albania's actions as a serious threat to international peace and security and will file a lawsuit with the Security Council. The note was delivered to the Albanian Embassy in Belgrade yesterday.

In short, the Soviet Union has broken its silence and clearly expressed its deep concern about Palestine, Italy, Libya, and the islands of the North Pacific near the equator.

[Our News] London, 11th Broadcast: The Four Powers Foreign Ministers' Conference temporarily stopped discussing the German problem last night while awaiting new instructions from Moscow regarding the procedures of the peace treaty, and instead discussed the Italian peace treaty. The Four Powers Foreign Ministers' Conference is currently stepping up its work to clear outstanding matters in the coming days and adjourn before Christmas.

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 10th] The Four Powers Foreign Ministers' Conference has reached an agreement on all issues related to the legal and territorial status of the Free Port of Trieste, except for one issue, which has been decided to be temporarily postponed. Experts who attended the Foreign Ministers' Conference and participated in the drafting of the Trieste plan said that if the economies of countries behind Trieste, such as Austria, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia, can be restored and a sufficient level of balance can be achieved, this step may enable the district to be self-sufficient within a few years. In short, the political system of Trieste can be summarized as follows: (1) The Port of Trieste will be opened as a free port, jointly ruled by the international community, but the political power is of an autonomous nature. (2) The free port will be ruled by the port governor, but this port governor must be nominated by the Trieste government committee and appointed by the chief executive of the district. (3) An international committee will be established, under the command of the port governor. The committee will be made up of a representative of the Trieste District, a representative each from Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, France, Italy, Austria, Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Switzerland. The chairman will be a representative of the Trieste District.

### Security Council Discusses Greek Complaint: Soviet Proposal Rejected; Discussion of Applications for Admission Extended

[Reuters, Lake Success, 10th] The Security Council met today and discussed the issue of Siam's application for admission to the UN, deciding to postpone consideration until the next meeting. It immediately debated the Greek government's memorandum accusing Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania of supporting Greek guerrillas, pointing out that this situation has caused friction between Greece and its neighbors, and if not quickly rectified, may endanger international peace and security. It therefore requested a speedy investigation on the ground. Greek Prime Minister Konstantinos Tsaldaris has personally come to New York to represent Greece.

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 11th] The Security Council discussed the Greek complaint today. The Soviet Union proposed inviting representatives of Bulgaria and Yugoslavia to participate in the discussion immediately, but without the right to vote. The proposal was rejected. At the same time, the Security Council unanimously passed a resolution inviting Greece to make a statement on the matter. It then discussed whether the Greek complaint was a "dispute" between Greece and its neighbors. It was immediately decided to postpone inviting representatives of Albania and Bulgaria to participate in the discussion until the Security Council decided on this issue. Finally, it was stipulated that Greece would participate in the discussion with Yugoslavia, but without the right to vote. The Security Council would invite Albania and Bulgaria to participate in the discussion when the Security Council determined that the issue was a "dispute."

### Independence for People in Trust Territories: Must Specify a Definite Date; Indian Representative Finally Withdraws Suggestion

[Our News] London, 11th Broadcast: An Indian representative in a UN committee recently suggested that each of the eight trusteeship agreements currently under consideration specify a definite date by which the trusteeship country should relinquish all sovereignty in the trust territory. In other words, the Indian representative aimed to secure a definite period of time to allow the people of the trust territory to become independent. However, the countries in charge of the territories strongly opposed this suggestion, and the resolution was withdrawn. However, the Indian representative, Menon, stated that he would re-submit the case after the UN Trusteeship Council was formally established.

### The UN General Assembly Has Approved the Budget for This Year

### UNRRA Holds Plenary Session, Emphasizes Future Relief Work, La Guardia Defends UNRRA Work, States Food Distribution Never Involved Politics

[United Press, Washington, 10th] With UNRRA's European operations ending this month and East Asian operations ending in March next year, representatives from UNRRA's 48 member nations convened here today in a plenary session. Director-General La Guardia vigorously defended UNRRA's food distribution efforts, stating that any claims of political manipulation in UNRRA's food allocation are absolutely incorrect. "I am completely unaware of any political considerations in food distribution," he said. La Guardia recounted that all UNRRA food shipments were decided by a nine-nation management committee. He claimed he had never heard any government object to political influence in food allocation. La Guardia's statement was a response to Undersecretary of State Acheson's statement on Sunday, in which Acheson said some countries received too much aid while others received too little, which was a grave error.

[US Information Service, Washington, 10th] UNRRA Director-General La Guardia today submitted a report on UNRRA's work for the third quarter of 1946 to the UNRRA Council's sixth session. According to the report, as of November 18th, UNRRA's work plan had been 72% completed. In total, UNRRA had shipped approximately 17,845,000 long tons (18,130,520 metric tons) of relief supplies, valued at $2,117,653,000. The main issue now is the continuation plan after UNRRA officially concludes relief efforts in Europe on December 31st of this year and in China on March 31st of next year.

### Investigation of National Armed Forces Becomes a Contentious Debate at the UN General Assembly, Nine Principles Agreed Upon Regarding Disarmament, Subcommittee Drafts Report for General Assembly Discussion

[United Press, Lake Success, 10th] British representative Noel-Baker today urged Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov in the United Nations General Assembly to approve the investigation plan for both foreign and domestic troops, saying, "We might as well let the facts be known, lift the curtain, and see the situation in all countries around the world, thereby dispelling suspicion." "I ask the Soviet Union not to follow a policy of isolation, creating suspicion." Shaw also stated that Molotov was actually opposing his own proposal. When the Political Committee passed the troop investigation case with 34 votes to 7, the Soviet Union expressed its dissent, stating that the issue of investigating the number of domestic troops was only related to the general disarmament case. Earlier, U.S. Representative Connally also stated, "We have no secrets, we should make our entire military strength public to the world, and hope that other countries can do the same," but Connally reiterated his opposition to the British proposal for the Security Council to send an investigation team to verify the reports of troop numbers on the ground.

[United Press, Lake Success, 11th] The United Nations General Assembly today continued to discuss the investigation of national armed forces. The Soviet representative agreed that an international organization should be responsible for investigating national armed forces, but insisted that the investigation of national armaments, including the atomic bomb, must be carried out simultaneously, merging the investigation of troops and armaments into one case. The British representative has "in principle" approved the method proposed by the Soviet Union. If this is passed by the General Assembly, the United States will inevitably have to make its atomic bomb secrets public immediately. The main point of contention at present is still the veto issue. The British representative insists that the international organization responsible for investigating national armed forces and armaments should not be bound by the veto power in the Security Council, while the Soviet representative argues the opposite. General Assembly President Spaak declared that if this motion is passed by the General Assembly, the entire organization for investigating national armed forces and armaments could be established by January 15th of next year.

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 10th] The drafting subcommittee of the UN General Assembly's Political and Security Committee is scheduled to hold its final meeting tomorrow to draft a report to be submitted to the Political and Security Committee, which, if passed, will then be submitted to the UN General Assembly for discussion. However, according to well-informed sources, agreements have been reached on all the key points to be included in the draft resolution, including: (1) Accelerating the work of the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission; (2) The Security Council should promptly review the reports submitted by the Atomic Energy Commission; (3) Recognizing the need to limit and reduce national armaments and armed forces; (4) Drafting agreements to prohibit atomic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction; (5) Establishing an international control agency under the jurisdiction of the Security Council, whose powers and duties will also be stipulated by the Security Council's agreement, but must be approved by all member states of the United Nations; (6) All member states of the United Nations should immediately place their necessary troops under the command of the Security Council to form an international army; (7) The troops of the United Nations member states stationed within the borders of former enemy countries should be gradually withdrawn according to progressive and proportional percentages; (8) The troops of the United Nations member states stationed within the borders of non-enemy countries should be withdrawn unless they have obtained the consent of the latter's government; (9) All countries should universally reduce their armed forces. Regarding the last point, the subcommittee discussed it for a long time, because it not only stipulated that domestic armed forces should be reduced, but also that the troops gradually withdrawn by member states from other countries should also be reduced. Finally, the British representative put forward an amendment requiring the United Nations to provide accurate information on their armaments and military strength, which was then passed by the subcommittee.

### The UN and the Universal Postal Union are Discussing a Draft Agreement

[Central News Agency, New York, 11th Dispatch] Experts from 38 countries met here today to study the draft agreement between the Universal Postal Union and the United Nations, drafted by the United Nations Secretariat. During today's meeting, many speakers considered several parts of the draft to be commendable. British expert Whitman said that one valuable contribution that the Universal Postal Union could make and use to assist the United Nations in maintaining world peace is to strip aggressors of the right to exchange mail with other countries.

### Iranian Government Troops Penetrate Deep into Azerbaijan Province, Capture the Important City of Mianeh, Britain Reiterates Non-Interference in Iranian Internal Affairs

[United Press, Tehran, 11th] According to reports, government troops, which entered Azerbaijan province to monitor the elections, have occupied Mianeh, southwest of Tabriz, the capital, about 200 kilometers from Tabriz. Frontline reports from Azerbaijan state that the news of the government troops occupying Mianeh after fierce fighting with the Azerbaijan Democratic Forces is likely to be true. If the city has been occupied, it means that the government troops have advanced 30 miles. The report also stated that the Soviet Ambassador to Iran, Sachekov, strongly protested to Prime Minister Sultaneh against the Iranian government's military actions, accusing the Iranian government of violating its promises by sending troops into Azerbaijan, which threatens the Soviet border. It is said that the Iranian Prime Minister is constantly being pressured by the Soviet side to stop military operations. Parliamentary elections have now begun in other parts of Iran, but elections in Azerbaijan will be held only when government forces are able to control the voting.

[Reuters, London, 10th] A British Foreign Office spokesman reiterated previous statements, declaring that the movement of Iranian troops within its own territory is purely an internal matter for the Iranian government. The spokesman denied rumors that the deployment of troops by the Iranian central government into Azerbaijan was based on British advice. When reporters asked whether the British government would still consider this an internal matter if war broke out in Azerbaijan, the answer was that the British government certainly believes that the turmoil within Iran should be resolved by the Iranian government.

### Soviet Union Expresses Concern

[This Newspaper] London, 11th Broadcast: Soviet newspapers today expressed concern about the civil war in Iran, and stated that the United States has assisted the Iranian government troops in their offensive with 404 bombers.

### Atomic Power Plant

To Appear in Chicago in Two Years

[Agence France-Presse, Chicago, 10th] Professor Burton, an American scientist who participated in the manufacture of the atomic bomb, recently stated here that the first power station utilizing atomic energy is expected to begin supplying electricity within two years. As for the entire city of Chicago being supplied with electricity generated by atomic energy, it will take ten years.

### Difficulties Abound in the New Egyptian Cabinet, Minister of Social Affairs Refuses to Take Office, Cairo's Security is Unstable and Tense, Future of Anglo-Egyptian Negotiations Difficult to Be Optimistic

[Agence France-Presse, Cairo, 10th] In response to the recent bombings and arson incidents, the authorities today ordered the police to shoot and kill anyone suspicious lurking in public places, in front of the residences of ministers and senior officials. In addition, it is learned that the new cabinet organized by Prime Minister Nokrashi was unable to be sworn in before King Farouk today because the newly appointed Minister of Social Affairs, Yarobaghan, resolutely refused to accept the position of minister. According to Yarobaghan, he was not consulted, so he cannot accept it. He always refused to sign an agreement with Britain in the previous cabinet, and he still insists on this view now.

[Reuters, London, 10th] Responsible political observers say that judging from the inaugural speech of the new Egyptian Prime Minister Nokrashi, the differences between Britain and Egypt regarding the future status of Sudan will continue to exist. Nokrashi said that his cabinet will lead the Sudanese to establish an autonomous government and be permanently unified with Egypt under the Egyptian king. Some believe that this is a formal explanation of the Sudan portion of the Bevin-Sidky Anglo-Egyptian draft. However, the idea of not allowing the Sudanese to be independent, but of permanently merging them with Egypt, has been rejected by both the Sudanese Governor-General Huddleston and the London Foreign Office. Since the British government has no tendency to abandon its position, it is expected that the Bevin-Sidky agreement will be difficult to serve as the basis for Anglo-Egyptian treaty amendment negotiations.

### Forcibly Kissing Vivien Leigh, Sentenced to Two Months in Prison

[Reuters, London, 10th] A 28-year-old university graduate, Vincent, attempted to forcibly kiss the famous actress Vivien Leigh when she and her husband Laurence Olivier got out of a car, and assaulted Olivier and two police officers nearby.

### US Denies Decision to Reduce Compensation Plan Demanded from Japan, Japan is About to Announce Five-Year Economic Plan

[Central News Agency, Washington, 11th Dispatch] US State Department personnel today denied rumors that the final plan for the amount of reparations the United States demanded from Japan was less than that requested by Pauley from Japanese industry. It is said that the reparations plan is still in the preparatory stage, and there is currently no final decision. It is not yet known whether it will be more or less than the Pauley plan.

[United Press, Tokyo, 11th] According to Japanese sources, the report on the Pauley plan for Japanese reparations, scheduled to be reported in Japan, has been postponed indefinitely in order to avoid causing international repercussions. It is said that the Japanese government is afraid that this will lead other countries to believe that Japan is planning to reduce the reparations conditions just as they are about to be announced.

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 11th] According to well-informed sources here, the Japanese government is about to announce the Five-Year Economic Construction Plan for 1945-1950. This plan will be based on the production of coal and hydropower, stipulating that 35 million tons of coal will be produced in 1950, which is equal to 80% of the 1937 level. Leaders from all walks of life in Japan firmly believe that the future of Japan lies in industry and foreign trade, not in democracy. The major issue at present is the reparations plan, and Pauley's reparations plan gives a clear concept of Japan's economic future.

### Billis Awarded US Gold Medal

[Central News Agency, Washington, 10th United Press] Former Prime Minister of Greece, Villis, was awarded the Gold Palm Calcium Leaf Medal by US Secretary of the Army Patterson for his meritorious anti-Japanese movement.

### Commander of US Fleet Discusses Future Wars, Arctic is Important, Coast Should Also be Emphasized

[United Press, New York, 10th] Lieutenant General Barber, Commander of the Fourth Fleet and expert on Pacific landing warfare, discussed the trends of future wars today. According to him, if the United States is attacked by weapons of mass destruction in the future, it may suffer 5 million casualties within a few hours. But the enemy cannot defeat us all at once. Within hours, our country will implement a large-scale retaliatory attack. The United States is at least ten years ahead of other countries in the manufacture of weapons of mass destruction, but we must continue to make progress. Military progress is the most powerful guarantee behind the success of the United Nations. If war breaks out again one day, it will never be a gentleman's duel, but a question of the existence of civilized people. In general, people value attacks coming across the Arctic, but I don't know why. I think it is more likely that foreign countries will send a dozen submarines and atomic bombs from locations hundreds of miles away in the Atlantic Ocean to the cities of the US East Coast. Rocket-type atomic bombs can still be launched even after the submarine sinks, but our retaliation will also be swift, and the enemy cannot avoid it and will suffer greater losses.

### China and India (Middle)

— (Written by Nehru)

Translated by Zhou Xiangguang, Correspondent of this Newspaper in India

Xuanzang tells us a lot about Nalanda University, and other records are similar. In the past few years, I have been to Nalanda University and was amazed to see a wide range of relics systematically excavated from the ruins. Only a small part has been excavated to this day and is still inhabited by people, but these places still include vast gardens surrounded by solemn stone houses.

Soon after Xuanzang passed away in China, another traveler, Monk Yijing, came to India. He set off from China in 671 AD and took two full years to reach the port of Derari in India, which is the mouth of the Hooghly River. He came by sea and stopped in Palembang (in Sumatra) for several months to study Chuwen. This decision to travel by sea was of profound significance, perhaps due to changes in the political situation that made Central Asia unstable and unable to come by land. Several Buddhist monasteries along the way were places for them to stop and rest. The sea route may have also been more suitable for the growth of India's colonies in Indonesia and for India to develop regular commercial relations with other countries. Records from Yijing and others show that at this time, there was regular navigation between Iran, India, Malaya, Sumatra and China. Yijing took a Persian ship from Guangzhou and initially arrived in Sumatra.

Yijing also studied at Nalanda University for a long time and brought back thousands of volumes of Sanskrit classics. His main interest lies in the key points of Buddhist rituals and rules, and he recorded these matters in great detail. He also told us a lot about clothing, food, and customs. The main food in North India is wheat, as it is now, while East India mainly eats rice. Although meat is sometimes eaten, it is also rare. Ghee, milk, and other things can be seen everywhere, and there are many biscuits and fruits. What Yijing recorded as very important to the Indians is relying on the purity of a certain specific religious ritual "Now the first most important difference between the five Indias and other countries is the sincerity of religious rituals. Moreover, "Food left over, which can be stored in China, may not be in accordance with Indian regulations."

Yijing talked about India, calling it the West, but he himself told us that India is named Aryadesha. The meaning of Arya is competition. The meaning of Desha is soil, which is competing soil - each is the West. The reason for this name is that the character of its people is noble and pure, and all the people praise this land with this name. India is also called "Middle Land" Madhyadesha because it is located in the center of a hundred teaching countries. All the people feel very close to this name. The northern barbarians (such as the Huns, Mongols, Turks) uniquely call the Pure Land India, but this is not a common term after all. This is just a name used locally and has no special meaning. The people of India do not know this name, and the most appropriate name for India is "Pure Land".

Yijing's discussion of Shendu is very interesting. He said, "Some people say that the meaning of India Indu is the moon, and the Chinese call India India, which comes from this. Although its meaning may be like this, this is not a common name. Or if the Indians call China Zhina, it is just a name and has no special meaning." He also mentioned the names used in Sanskrit for Korea and other countries.

Yijing had the utmost respect for India, and the same was true for things in India. He described these things in detail and first gave them to his motherland - China. India may be a "Pure Land", but China is a "Divine Land". "The people of the Five Indias are very proud of their sincerity and nobility. However, the emphasis on thought, writing, cultivation, composure, correct attitude, peaceful demeanor, etiquette for welcoming and sending, the taste of food and soup, and a kind and just mind can only be obtained in China, not in other countries." The healing of acupuncture and the subtlety of feeling the pulse cannot be replaced anywhere in India, and the extension of life with medicine can only be seen in China... Judging from the character of people and the quality of things, China is called Divine Land. Can any of the Five Indias not respect China?"

The ancient Sanskrit term for the Chinese emperor was Deva-Putra, whose accurate translation is "Son of Heaven".

Yijing himself was a Sanskrit scholar, he praised Sanskrit, and he also said that in the more distant countries of the north and south, this language is also respected: there are even some people from the Divine Land (China) and Paradise (India) who teach the rules of this language: Sanskrit scholars in China must have been extremely common. We find it interesting that some Chinese scholars wanted to use Sanskrit phonemes in the Chinese language. A good example is the Tang Dynasty Chinese monk Suwen, who wanted to make the Chinese language into an alphabetic phonetic system in this direction. As Indian Buddhism waned, although there were often pilgrims from China visiting the Buddhist holy sites in India, in fact, the exchanges between scholars from the two countries had ended. When the political revolution took place in the 11th century AD, all Buddhist monks carried their scriptures and went to Nepal, or crossed the Himalayas to Tibet. We already knew that the important parts of ancient Indian literature had reached China and Tibet, and in recent years they have been found there completely in their original form, and there are quite a few translations as well. Many ancient Indian classics, not only those related to Buddhism, but also those related to Brahmanism, astronomy, arithmetic, and medicine, are still preserved in Chinese and Tibetan. The best example of this scholarly connection that still exists today is the dictionary of Sanskrit, Tibetan, and Chinese Buddhist terms. This book was written around the 9th or 10th century AD and is called the Great Dictionary Mahavyutpatti.

### Lu Jingshi Convened Representatives of Textile Workers to Discuss the Distribution of Year-End Bonuses, Labor Expresses Concessions, Hoping to Still Follow Past Practices, Social Affairs Bureau Will Convene Talks with Business Leaders

[This Newspaper] Lu Jingshi, Director of the Organization and Training Department of the Ministry of Social Affairs, yesterday afternoon convened representatives of cotton textile workers at the meeting room of the Social Affairs Bureau to exchange views on the issue of year-end bonuses. Director Lu told reporters that the workers hope to receive a year-end bonus of six months' salary because the profits of the cotton textile industry are very high; however, the business side believes that yarn prices have been restricted and profits are limited, and although the books show cheap money, they have not increased when calculated in terms of materials, and cannot accept the workers' demands. After his persuasion, the labor side is willing to make considerable concessions, but at a minimum, they hope to follow past practices and divide the workers' year-end bonuses into 20%, 25%, and 33% of their total annual income, with production workers getting 20% and management personnel getting 30%. The so-called total annual income refers to the actual income after deducting holidays. I believe that the labor and management sides of the cotton textile industry will be able to work together harmoniously and reach an agreement on this issue under the principles of maintaining production and protecting labor. Furthermore, according to labor representatives, yesterday's meeting was an informal exchange of views, and the labor side has put forward its views as much as possible for reference. Lu will return to Beijing tomorrow and will come to Shanghai again on the 21st of this month. At that time, there should be a concrete resolution on the year-end bonus issue for the cotton textile industry.

It is also learned that Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, is scheduled to convene a discussion meeting with the standing directors of the city's General Labor Union, industry associations, and the City Chamber of Commerce at 4:00 PM on the 13th of this month (Friday). Notices have already been issued, hoping that all will attend at that time.

### Discussion of Relief for the Unemployed Postponed to Next Week

[This Newspaper] The Social Affairs Bureau originally scheduled a meeting yesterday to discuss a plan to provide relief for unemployed workers, but it was temporarily unable to be held due to unforeseen circumstances and it was decided to postpone it to next Monday. According to Deputy Director Li Jianhua of the bureau, the workers' hostel was originally scheduled to accommodate more than 1,000 workers, but the actual number of people currently accommodated is more than 1,800. Due to overcrowding, environmental hygiene has been greatly affected, resulting in more than ten workers' children dying from smallpox in November. At the meeting next week, discussions will be held on how to improve the medical and health facilities of the hostel, and the issue of raising funds for this. As for the placement of unemployed workers, Li believes that the symptomatic solution is to enable factories that have already started work to maintain operations, and to enable those that have not started work to resume operations as soon as possible. The fundamental solution is to improve the entire national economy to increase employment opportunities.

### Patrolling and Inspecting Restricted Construction Areas, Gently Persuading Residents to Demolish Shanties, Over 100 Acres of Vacant Land in Five Locations Approved for Shantytown Residents to Rent

[Our Newspaper's Report] Following the Municipal Council's decision to ban illegally constructed shanties within the city's restricted construction zones, the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, acting under orders, commenced patrol and enforcement operations yesterday in conjunction with the Police Bureau.

At 9:00 AM yesterday, the two bureaus formed a joint patrol team, led by Song Xueqin, Section Chief of the Demolition Section of the Bureau of Public Works, and Lu Xia, Section Chief of the Traffic Section of the Police Bureau, with six police officers and six artisans. Before the patrol team set out, Zhao Shekang, Director of the Bureau of Public Works, convened a briefing, instructing all personnel to persuade shantytown residents to demolish their structures with sincerity and kindness, explaining the reasons for the demolition, the public interest involved, and the resettlement measures to be taken, ensuring that residents have a way out. In the morning, the patrol team inspected along Changning Road and Kaixuan Road, and in the afternoon, they visited Yangshupu and the Suzhou Creek area. More structures were found in the Yangshupu area, while the situation on other roads was better. When the patrol team encountered a few shantytown residents constructing houses, they explained the demolition order. The residents were very cooperative and agreed to demolish their structures within two or three days. The artisans and police officers accompanying the team did not forcibly demolish any structures yesterday but issued warnings that if the structures were not demolished within the allotted time, the authorities would demolish them on their behalf.

Simultaneously, Director Zhao of the Bureau of Public Works, accompanied by Wang Yuankang, Director of the Construction Division, personally inspected Changshou Road, Xikang Road, Yuyao Road, Yichang Road, and Jiangning Road yesterday morning. The most construction was found on Yuyao Road (formerly Singapore Road), where most of the shanties in the central district were built on roads or in alleyways. Director Zhao will personally inspect the Yangshupu district again today. A reporter interviewed Director Zhao yesterday, inquiring about the measures for dealing with shantytowns. He stated that shanties under construction in the restricted areas would be demolished and that residents should build in non-restricted areas. Furthermore, according to urban planning, the Municipal Government has approved the transfer of instructions to the Bureau of Land Administration to purchase private land in five locations for the construction of affordable housing villages, totaling 163 acres. These locations are: 21 acres on Feihong Road in Yangshupu, 45 acres in Caojiadu in the Pusong District, 40.8 acres on Tianyaoqiao Road in the Hunan District, 15.6 acres in Yangjiapo in Pudong, and 40.8 acres on Zhaoju Road in the Hunan District. This land was originally intended to be included in next year's budget for the construction of affordable housing villages. However, before funding is secured, shantytown residents may be allowed to select and rent vacant land.

The Bureau previously constructed over 100 affordable housing units in Damuqiao in the Nanshi district. Currently, besides being rented by a small number of citizens, the remaining units are occupied by municipal government employees. Director Zhao also stated that to align with urban planning, building construction must be zoned. Building dormitories near factories could alleviate the housing shortage to some extent. Residential and commercial areas should also be zoned separately. Director Zhao also inspected bottle-neck shaped protruding houses in the city yesterday and will submit this issue for discussion at the next Municipal Council meeting.

[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding the city's road repair projects, Zhao Zukang, Director of the Bureau of Public Works, told reporters yesterday that the main road construction projects in the city have been completed, totaling 120,000 square meters. The repair of branch roads is also actively underway. According to the Bureau's plan, from the first day of this month to February of next year, within three months, 100,000 square meters of branch roads will be repaired. Roads that have been completed include Fansi Ferry Road, Central Lin Sen Road, and Central Fuxing Road. Roads that are about to be constructed include Yunnan Road, Shandong Road, Guangxi Road, Qiujiang Road, North Xizang Road, and Zha Pu Road. It is claimed that if the road repair funds allocated by the Municipal Government next year are sufficient, the roads in the central city, including the British and French Concession areas, can be fully repaired from April to December next year. As for all the roads in the city, including the suburbs, it is hoped that they can be repaired within two years.

### Launching Winter Relief Fund, Speaker Pan Takes the Lead, Municipal Council Begins Fundraising

Recently, cold weather has struck Shanghai. Yesterday was an entire day of wind and rain. Impoverished people suffering from cold and hunger are dying daily. Although the Municipal Government has actively raised funds, the amount is limited and cannot benefit all the poor. In view of this, Pan Gongzhan, Speaker of the Municipal Council, believes that it is necessary to mobilize all citizens of Shanghai to assist in order to be effective. Yesterday, he sent a letter to the Municipal Council instructing them to assist the government in actively launching winter relief efforts to achieve the goal of serving the people. Speaker Pan himself took the lead by donating all of the council's travel expenses of over 500,000 yuan to the relief effort. It is reported that the council has already complied and plans to start fundraising today. It is also hoped that various legal entities will participate together to support this righteous cause.

### The Opera "Meng Jiangnu" Performs Successfully, Madame Chiang Holds Tea Party to Thank Patrons, Mei Lanfang Critiques Performance, Fei Xi Praises the Plot

Yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM, Madame Chiang Song Meiling held a tea party at the second guest house of the Lixingshe to thank the Shanghai patrons of the "Meng Jiangnu" opera, which was performed to raise funds for the rehabilitation of the school for orphans of National Revolutionary Army soldiers.

Despite the heavy rain, Madame Chiang arrived on time, shook hands and exchanged greetings with the guests, and was in a very pleasant mood. After light refreshments were served, Madame Chiang first consulted Dr. Mei Lanfang and Wang Bosheng, president of the National Academy of Drama, separately, on their criticisms of the content of the "Meng Jiangnu" opera. Both believed that apart from some minor improvements needed in the performance techniques, the plot's meaning was profound and well represented a part of Chinese culture.

Subsequently, Huang Renlin, the general secretary, reported briefly that he was very grateful for the enthusiastic fundraising by all sectors of society for the Shanghai performance of the "Meng Jiangnu" opera. Based on the observations of the continuous performances, the total income may reach 400 million yuan. Among all the patrons, Mr. Du Yuesheng, Qian Xinzhi, and Xu Jikang provided the most assistance. Mr. Mei Lanfang and Mr. Wang Bosheng provided the most active guidance, which made such success possible, which was a rare opportunity. The performance on the 10th night was sold out. The closing night was originally scheduled for the 11th, but to satisfy the audience's interests, an additional performance was added on the 12th, and the daytime ticket prices were reduced to 2,000 and 4,000 yuan, and the evening ticket prices were reduced to 5,000 and 10,000 yuan so that ordinary citizens could enjoy the performance. After Mr. Huang finished his report, Madame Chiang gave a speech.

Madame Chiang then delivered a speech, saying that the "Meng Jiangnu" opera had achieved great success in Shanghai. She not only represented the orphan school in expressing her gratitude to all of you for fundraising for the education fund for our orphans, but also felt that it was deeply meaningful and heartwarming that Chinese culture could be introduced to foreign countries through the "Meng Jiangnu" opera, which would increase international understanding. After the "Meng Jiangnu" opera was performed, she and the Chairman watched it four times and felt that the content of the play was much improved compared to ordinary old plays. General Marshall was also interested in the play and often talked about it, which proved that the play could attract many audiences if it was performed abroad.

Patrons then expressed their opinions one by one on how to improve the play, which can be summarized as follows: (1) The music must be coordinated with the movements, (2) The actress playing Meng Jiangnu is too old, (3) Gods and ghosts are mixed together, and the movements are chaotic, (4) The makeup needs to be improved to distinguish between good and evil. Finally, Madame Chiang asked foreign guest Fei Xi for his opinion. He said that the plot was very good and hoped that it could be performed in Washington, New York, and other places in the United States. Madame Chiang expressed her agreement. Then, Huang, the general secretary, concluded by saying that everyone's enthusiastic support not only made a great contribution to cultural work, but also laid the foundation for the special nature of the orphan school. He expressed his great gratitude to everyone. The guests chatted happily until about 6:00 PM before the party broke up. After the meeting, Madame Chiang, accompanied by Huang Renlin, inspected each scene in the guest house for a week before taking a car back to her official residence on Dongping Road to rest. At 8:30 PM, Madame Chiang went to the Nanjing Grand Theater to watch the "Meng Jiangnu" performance again. She was very interested and returned home at the end of the show.

### Head of the Troupe Says Number of Performers will be Reduced When Going Abroad

Also, Deng Shiping, general manager of the China Youth Music Troupe, told reporters that the opera had been performed at the Lixingshe in Nanjing for nine days since November 6, attracting a large audience. The ticket prices were divided into two types: 10,000 yuan and 50,000 yuan, and the total income was over 100 million yuan. The opera has been performed in Shanghai since December 5, and the ticket prices are divided into three types: 10,000 yuan, 20,000 yuan, and 50,000 yuan. The total income will be calculated after the performance is completed. The results are generally good. However, there are still many shortcomings in the plot content and performance techniques. He hopes that people from all walks of life will give more guidance and support. The troupe will sincerely accept and earnestly improve. When asked about the total number of actors, he said that there are 35 actors, and about 60 people including the opera affairs. In the future, if the opera is performed abroad, the number of people will still be reduced as much as possible.

### President Song Returns to Nanjing After Finishing Public Affairs

[Our Newspaper's Report] President Song, after coming to Shanghai to negotiate with the banking, financial, industrial, and commercial sectors to finalize the production loan and eliminate the cotton note black market plan, took a China Airlines flight back to Nanjing with his secretary and adjutant yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM.

### Meeting with Taixu in the Jade Buddha Temple, Abbot Jiasha of the Buddhist Order Looks Gloomy

[Special Feature from Our Newspaper] In the cold rain, with the chanting of Buddhist scriptures, the Jade Buddha Temple looked even more quiet, solemn, and serene.

Master Songyue led us through a corridor, on the rear side of the Grand Hall, stopping in front of a quiet room. He stepped forward and said with a smile:

"This is the venerable Master Taixu."

Venerable Master Taixu was wearing a brownish-yellow monk's robe, with the cuffs of a white flannel shirt protruding from the sleeves. He wore a wool cap, also dark brown. Behind the tortoiseshell-rimmed glasses were a pair of kind and happy eyes, smiling at us. He extended his plump and elegant hand for a warm handshake. We sat down on the comfortable sofas. Master Songyue sat quietly on a chair nearby, listening.

The Buddhist order prohibits killing, and with the prospect of a large-scale fratricidal war looming, the conversation naturally turned to the current situation. The venerable master seemed to hesitate for a moment and said slowly, "Since the 26th year of the Republic [1937], the Kuomintang finally won the War of Resistance. In fact, the whole country should have been able to rest and recuperate, and things should have settled down. Who knew—that negotiations would fail to yield results, leading to this state of affairs!"

The venerable master lowered his head, unable to help but nod.

Buddhist Monks Forming a Party

We changed the subject: "Recently, there has been talk about Buddhist monks forming a party. What is your opinion on this, Venerable Master?"

"I discussed this issue in the first issue of the Juequn Weekly. Zhongshan Xisheng said that political power belongs to all the people, and monks and nuns are also people. They should ask about political affairs. We can participate in elections, go to the Senate, the Provincial Assembly, or the National Assembly—but I do not advocate forming a party."

Master Taixu has always been very concerned about Buddhist education. In Chongqing, he presided over the Haizang Buddhist Academy, which played a significant role in the border areas.

Speaking of Tibetan Buddhism, I could not help but think of Esoteric Buddhism, because the various miracles of Living Buddha Nuona in Shanghai were too strange. The master said: Esoteric Buddhism is indeed a bit strange, but it is indeed Mahayana Buddhism. Some strange things can be called "techniques," but what the Haizang Buddhist Academy studies are "teachings," are "learning."

The Jing'an Temple Incident

In the morning, we talked about the Jing'an Temple incident, which has attracted much attention.

Master Taixu scratched his head, already full of silver threads. He said firmly:

"I think this matter includes two parts. The first part is the matter of Dewu and Mijia being reported as traitors. To be honest, these two people cannot really be considered traitors. If anyone who participated in a people's organization once or twice during the enemy-puppet period is considered a traitor, I am afraid that there are four or five million people in the occupied areas who should be reported. The second part is the issue of how to manage Jing'an Temple and its property. I feel that the previous management system of temples is no longer suitable for modern times. The Haizang Buddhist Academy that I established in Chongqing was originally a dilapidated temple, because the management of the temple was poor and it was severely damaged. Later, when the academy was established, a board of directors was formed to manage the temple property, and a dedicated person was hired to be responsible for the academy's affairs, which led to success. I believe that the temple property of Jing'an Temple can also be managed by organizing a board of directors, and hospitals, libraries, or schools can be established on the temple grounds, and dedicated personnel can be hired to be responsible for administrative affairs—it can be operated as a business run by Buddhists. This may be a more appropriate method."

On Abbot Liugen

Jing'an Temple is currently managed by Abbot Liugen, but the master clearly believes that the current method is not a fundamental solution. He said: "In the future, when Dewu and the others return, there will definitely be disputes. Liugen is a useless and incompetent person. He also presided over Jing'an Temple in the early years of the Republic, but he has never managed it well since he came, and lawsuits have never stopped. Therefore, the fundamental management method must be improved."

The master is already fifty-eight years old this year. In recent years, because of high blood pressure, he cannot write too much or speak too much. Soon, he may go to Ningbo once. The National Buddhist Association meeting to be held in Nanjing next year will also be presided over by the master.

When leaving the Jade Buddha Temple, dusk in the rain was already very bleak.

### Christian Conference Concludes Successfully After Week-Long Meeting Gathering Representatives from Various Regions

The 12th National Delegates Conference of the National Christian Council of China, which opened in Shanghai on the 3rd of this month, concluded successfully yesterday after a week-long session. Delegates from as far as the nine northeastern provinces attended, making it the largest gathering in more than a decade. Leading churches in England, the United States, and Canada also sent representatives to participate, discussing how to advance the plan and seeking to send one hundred newly trained specialized technical personnel to China next year to assist in all construction plans, including experts such as musicians, scientists, educators, and social workers. Many insightful proposals were made by various groups. In response to the Chairman's call to engage in spiritual construction, the council specifically decided to launch a three-year national endeavor movement starting next year, concentrating all talents and resources to promote the success of the endeavor movement and improve the spiritual life of the people. Other proposals included welcoming missionaries to China to assist in their work, intensifying the training of talents, raising the salaries of staff, improving the methods of advanced studies, strengthening cooperation in various undertakings, paying attention to assisting in the promotion of national education, developing work in border areas, and planning the publication of a Christian Daily News, totaling dozens of proposals. Before the closing ceremony, the council also elected Liang Xiaoye as president, and Jiang Changchuan, Cui Xianxiang, Zhao Zizhen, Bao Zheqing, and others as members. In addition to issuing a declaration, the conference sent a telegram to Chairman Jiang to pay their respects.

### Coal Supply Has Improved, Sources Being Actively Developed, 6,000 Tons of Annam Anthracite Coal to Arrive

According to the person in charge of the Shanghai District Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs: In order to prevent the black market for coal in the city, the method of allocating coal to factories has been improved this month. Previously, the required quantity of coal for each factory was applied for by the coal industry association on behalf of its members. Now, factories directly submit applications with the actual required quantity. The association then reviews and allocates the coal. This can help factories increase production to meet demand and avoid the association manipulating the allocation. In addition, it can naturally reduce black market prices. As for anthracite coal, it is estimated that 6,000 tons may arrive from Annam on the 15th. Furthermore, the Committee had negotiated with coal mines in the Annam and had secured agreement for a substantial quantity. Unless there are unexpected twists and turns, 6,000 tons can be shipped to China each month, with the first batch arriving by the end of the month. As for lump coal, there is a shortage in various countries after the war, and merchants are free to purchase it. The Committee had previously negotiated with the United States to purchase 10,000 tons. If the dockworkers' strike in that area is resolved, the coal can be shipped. The allocation method will be determined separately.

Relief of Coal Shortage Depends on Increasing Supply

The person in charge continued: In order to solve the current difficulty of raw materials for coal briquettes, in addition to ensuring a regular supply of raw materials, another 2,000 tons of small anthracite coal blocks will be added this month to the coal briquette industry association to supplement the raw materials. Regarding the elimination of the general black market problem, it is still hoped that the local government will do its best to assist. The person in charge finally stated: The relief of the coal shortage depends on increasing supply, the most important of which is the transportation problem. According to the past, the arrival of goods from various places was ideal from March to September, but the performance in October and November was poor. Within the scope of ability, efforts will be made to strengthen it as much as possible. In addition to maintaining 140,000 to 150,000 tons per month from opening resources and more than 50,000 tons from Taiwan, which are allocated to traffic, hydropower institutions, and factories in the valley, the National Resources Commission is paying unusual attention to coal production. It is estimated that the Northeast can produce 5 million tons next year, and one-fifth can be transported for use within the customs. As soon as Huludao thaws next spring, it can begin. The Jiaozuo Coal Mine, which can produce 1,000 tons of anthracite coal per day, has been recovered by the National Army and is actively producing. The mine has 140,000 tons of coal in stock, but unfortunately, the railway from Jiaozuo to Xinxiang has not been repaired, and the road is long and the train transportation is difficult. Arrangements have been made with the UNRRA authorities to transport the coal by truck from the producing area to Xinxiang.

### "Jiang Ya" Ship Repairs Boilers, "An Shun" Ship Clears Expenses

[Our Newspaper's Report] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Shanghai-Ningbo route is operated by the "Jiang Ya" and "Jiang Jing" ships. The "Jiang Ya" ship is currently out of service for boiler repairs and is expected to be repaired within this week and resume service next week. Therefore, only the "Jiang Jing" ship operates between Shanghai and Ningbo. Other ships on this route, such as the "Da Hua" and "Jiang Su", operate as usual. The "Cai E" ship of the Beiyang Shanghai-Tianjin route returned to Shanghai last Saturday. It was originally scheduled to sail to Tianjin on the 10th, but the bow cabin was damaged and is being repaired. It is scheduled to sail to Tianjin tomorrow. The Taikoo Steam Navigation Company's "An Shun" ship left Shanghai on October 2, 1941 (i.e., the 30th year of the Republic), carrying cargo and passengers, via Xiamen and Hong Kong, to Singapore and Penang. A fire broke out en route and was extinguished, with some damage to the cargo. The company entrusted Jardine Matheson & Co. to apportion the water damage costs. At that time, each merchant paid a water damage guarantee deposit of 20%. However, the process was suspended due to the Japanese invasion of the South Seas and the tense war situation. Now that victory has been achieved, in order to clear the procedures, the company has decided that from the 16th of this month, anyone holding a water damage guarantee deposit receipt can register with Jardine Matheson & Co. until June 30 of next year. After the registration procedures are completed, the water damage apportionment method will be agreed upon.

### The City's Stadium is in Ruins, Visiting in the Rain Makes it Feel Even More Bleak, Chief of the Ordnance Department Ordered to Shanghai for Thorough Investigation

[Our Newspaper's Report] At 10:00 AM yesterday, Fu Wen, Commander of the First Supply Area of the Rear Service Headquarters, led his subordinates, together with Ling Chengxu, Deputy Director of the First Division of the Fourth Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, Yan Zi of the Shanghai East Intelligence Office of the Garrison Headquarters, and more than 20 reporters from various newspapers, to re-examine the site of the explosion at the old Jiangwan Stadium. At the time, the wind and rain were bleak, and the sky was gloomy. The four charred corpses beside the western grandstand looked even more tragic under the wash of the wind and rain. Commander Fu led the inspection of the explosion site for a week. Fearing that there might be unexpected dangers, he did not continue the excavation and drove back.

[Another News] Shang Jihui, Chief of the Ordnance Department of the Ministry of National Defense, was ordered by Chief of Staff Chen to come to Shanghai to thoroughly investigate the truth of this explosion and arrived in Shanghai at 4:00 PM yesterday. He immediately discussed the aftermath with Commander Chang and others in detail in the evening.

### Relevant Parties to Hold Meeting, Disappearance of Warehouse Manager Increases Difficulty of Investigation

According to sources from relevant parties yesterday, the personnel specially sent by the relevant agencies to Shanghai to investigate the case may hold a meeting in the next few days to exchange opinions. A reporter from the Central News Agency specially interviewed someone in charge of investigating the case yesterday and was told that the truth about the fire and the exact cause of the fire are still unclear. No one witnessed the situation at the time of the incident. Although the warehouse worker who escaped last claimed that the fire was caused by a series of grenade explosions in the warehouse, this was only based on the sound of the explosions, and the situation could not be completely understood. In addition, the disappearance of the warehouse manager Wang Renshan and the warehouse staff Wu Rulin has made the investigation of the case more difficult. Based on the situation at the time, it is judged that Wang Renshan and others are unlikely to have been killed. If they are fleeing out of fear of crime, if Wang and others can come forward and surrender and explain the daily handling situation, this can add to the clues for the investigation. In short, the truth about the incident is still under strict investigation to reveal the truth.

### Qian Changzhao Inspects South China, Departs for Taiwan This Morning

### Exemption from Transportation Business Tax, Inland River Shipping Continues to Strive

The Shanghai Inland River Shipping Industry Association, previously faced with the issue of the Shanghai Direct Taxation Bureau levying business tax on the shipping industry, which caused a strong reaction and led to repeated appeals to the authorities, has now heard that the Ministry of Finance's reply forwarded by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has been rejected. The association immediately convened an emergency meeting and unanimously decided to continue to strive for exemption to avoid the disastrous consequences of overtaxing shipping merchants, and if necessary, will unite with all relevant parties to petition the authorities in Beijing for a final effort.

### The Ugly Drama of the Disappearance Case Before the August 13th Incident: Miyazaki Sadao Appears in Japan After Ten Years of Imprisonment in China

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] Recent news from Japan indicates that a man named Miyazaki Sadao has resurfaced.

Who is Miyazaki Sadao?

On July 24th of the 26th year of the Republic of China, just seventeen days after the July 7th Incident and nine days before August 22nd, Shanghai was at its most tense. Suddenly, at ten o'clock that night, two Japanese officers reported to the Disraeli Road Police Station that a private first class, Miyazaki Sadao, was missing during the roll call of the Japanese Marines that evening.

The Japanese military requested an investigation from the authorities while the Marines immediately dispatched soldiers to patrol, block traffic, and inspect pedestrians, creating a very tense situation.

Yu Hongjun, the acting mayor of Shanghai at the time, notified the Japanese Consul General Okamoto, asking him to act cautiously and avoid further agitating the public.

However, how did the Japanese side react?

Major newspapers in Tokyo reported the news in special, large-print editions. Japanese warships, led by the "Izumo" cruiser, sailed into the Wusongkou port one after another.

By the 26th, the situation had calmed down, and the public was gradually reassured.

However, the whereabouts of Miyazaki Sadao remained unknown.

The Japanese Consulate was still frantically holding meetings daily when, suddenly, Miyazaki Sadao was found in the river off Bazhugang in Jingjiang County!

What follows is an excerpt from Miyazaki's "confession" at the police station, which he also signed with his fingerprint at the end:

"At around nine o'clock on the afternoon of the 24th, I went alone to a brothel on Bazilu Road. At nine-thirty, after paying two dollars, I wanted to walk back, but three men, who seemed to be Chinese, chased after me, demanding more money. After arguing for a while, I took a rickshaw towards the Peace Pagoda. However, when I left the brothel, a Japanese sailor saw me arguing with these three men. Because I was wearing a military uniform and afraid of being recognized, I discarded my military cap and collar before getting into the rickshaw to go to the Peace Pagoda. After passing the Peace Pagoda, I wrapped my uniform in a newspaper and hid for two nights. On the morning of the 26th, I boarded an English ship to escape. On the ship, I slept on the deck. The crew said they would report to the captain. Because I was traveling without a ticket, I was filled with fear, so at one o'clock in the afternoon of the 26th, I jumped into the Yangtze River. At that time, the ship had already reached Jingjiang. On the 27th, I was rescued."

Jingjiang County sent him to the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and on the afternoon of the 28th, he was handed over to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs returned him to the Japanese military authorities.

However, upon receiving him, the Japanese military felt greatly humiliated. The protagonist of this farce was immediately arrested and accused of some crime of selling appropriated goods, and sent back to Japan, where he was imprisoned until recently.

Miyazaki Sadao spent ten years in prison, and the Japanese military seems to have thought that this covered up the shame.

This is the behavior of a "samurai" in a country that often boasts of "bushido"!

### Two Beloved Sons Missing, Lingering in Government Offices: Owner of Money Exchange Suffers Business Failure, Misfortune Comes in Pairs, Enduring Fear

[Report from Our Newspaper] Jiang Yaotang, a 40-year-old man from Zhenjiang, opened the Xietai Money Exchange at 180 Nanjing Road and resided at 111 Zhaofeng Villa, Changning Road. He had a wife and a concubine, Ms. Gu and Ms. Wu, respectively, who got along well on weekdays. Ms. Gu gave birth to two sons, the elder named Lingdi, nine years old, and the younger named Maomao, only four years old. The family of several lived happily. Unexpectedly, Xietai Exchange suffered excessive losses recently and went bankrupt on the 9th. Rumors spread, and creditors flocked to Jiang's residence to demand payment of debts, carrying away redwood furniture as collateral. At that time, Jiang could only let them do as they pleased and voluntarily issued a written guarantee to clear the debt on time. After the creditors left, Yaotang also went out. Not long after, another group of creditors arrived, and amidst the commotion, unexpectedly, Jiang's two children, Lingdi and Maomao, disappeared at the same time. After Ms. Gu discovered this, she immediately reported to the Changning Road Branch Bureau, requesting an investigation. Police were dispatched to investigate, but no clues were found that night. By eleven o'clock yesterday morning, the two children were suddenly found in the French Park, reported by the gardener to the Lujiiawan Branch Bureau, who dispatched police to bring them back. The Changning Branch Bureau was notified and ordered the police to go and bring them back for investigation. According to the two children, two people took them into a car at that time and drove away quickly, detained them for a night, and then sent them to the French Park the next morning. This matter is quite suspicious, whether it was a prank by an enemy or there were other motives, it has not been clarified yet.

### Municipal Construction Donations Collected Last Month Only Exceeded 6 Billion Yuan

After the Municipal Council decided to levy additional municipal construction donations during its first conference, it was handed over to the Municipal Government for implementation. The Finance Bureau started collecting the autumn municipal construction donations in November and is now nearing completion, with only over 6 billion yuan collected, a huge difference from the ideal amount. The main reason for this is that the Finance Bureau collected the donations according to the pre-war housing donation registers of the Municipal Government's Public Works Bureau and the French Municipal Council, so there are only over 160,000 households in the city, which is less than half of the current number. It is reported that the bureau is now trying to improve so that such a phenomenon will not occur again during the winter collection.

### Fire Drill Postponed for the Second Time

The Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau's Fire Prevention Publicity Week, Fire Police Drill and Firefighting Performance, originally scheduled for November 30, was postponed due to rain and loose ground, which could not bear the weight of the fire trucks. It was originally scheduled to be held at 9:30 tomorrow morning in the Zhongzheng Park, but due to the wind and rain last night, it was decided to postpone it for the second time and will be held after the weather clears.

### Youth League Hosts the Last Batch of Demobilized Soldiers This Morning

The Youth League also arranged for the Jincheng Grand Theater to show the domestic film "Iron Bones and Ice Heart" for entertainment at nine o'clock this morning. Before the screening, the Shanghai Branch of the Youth League distributed a towel and other practical gifts to each person.

### Investigation of the Administrative Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) Section Chief's Embezzlement of Public Funds Completed; Public Prosecution Filed: Wu Suiren's Crime of Corruption; Beijing Office States in Letter that Wu Seemed to Have Been Preparing for Fraud

[Report from Our Newspaper] The case of Wu Suiren, a clerk in the Disbursement Section of the General Affairs Department of the Administrative Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), embezzling public education funds for lending at interest, has been investigated by Prosecutor Liu Yongzhi of the District Procuratorate, and a public prosecution has been filed for the crime of corruption.

According to the case, Wu Suiren used his position to embezzle 2.7 billion yuan of UNRRA's September funds for lending at interest. On October 28, when the department discovered the embezzlement, Wu immediately expressed remorse and returned the entire 2.7 billion yuan of public funds, along with the 14.6 million yuan in interest earned. Although UNRRA did not suffer any losses, the embezzlement of public funds violated the criminal code. Huo Doushu, the director of UNRRA, sent a letter to the District Procuratorate on November 16, requesting legal action. After accepting the case, the procuratorate issued an arrest warrant and detained Wu Suiren on the morning of the 27th. The prosecution has now been filed after investigating the case.

### Three Other Remittances Also Found Suspicious

[Another Report] The UNRRA office in Beijing sent a letter to the UNRRA headquarters, stating that Wu Suiren seemed to have been preparing for fraud. On August 16, Wu sent a letter to the Beijing office requesting that the checks be changed to named payee checks for easy collection. Therefore, in addition to the 2.7 billion yuan embezzlement, there are also suspicions that (1) 1.8 billion yuan remitted from Beijing to Shanghai on September 13 to cover the August UNRRA funds, (2) 2 billion yuan remitted to Shanghai on October 3 to cover the August UNRRA funds, and (3) 500 million yuan remitted to Shanghai on October 24 to cover the additional allocation of the September UNRRA funds were delayed in order to obtain interest.

Request for Confrontation

Next, Chen Mo was questioned. Chen, wearing a coffee-colored camel hair robe and black leather shoes, nodded to his family when he entered the court. Standing in the defendant's dock, he showed an arrogant expression. He stated that he was originally the leader of the Vanguard Corps of the Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army, and resigned around September 10 last year. He is now doing import and export business. In August of last year, because the Vanguard Corps had no place to live, he moved into the residence of the traitor Li Tuqun through the introduction of Tang Shengming, and left the residence when the corps was ordered to go to Liuhe for assembly at the end of August. He did not go there to seal it up. This matter can be inquired of Li's wife, Ye Jiqing. He does not know where Liang Hongzhi's residence is. Chen's residence was the residence of the Military Statistics Bureau. He denied that the Qianlong-era folding fan belonged to Liang Hongzhi. He testified that the circumstances of his purchase of the folding fan were the same as those described by his wife. The court presented two letters of accusation from the Sino-American Cooperative Organization for the defendant to read. Chen argued that he did not know the accuser, Wu Yongqing, and it would be best to have him appear in court for a confrontation. At this point, the court ordered Chen Mo to sit aside and then summoned the witness, Cai Depei, to testify.

Merchant Testifies

Cai Depei testified that he used to study at West China University in Chengdu and is now doing business in Shanghai. He met the defendant in Hong Kong in 1939. Around the first month of 1944, he accompanied Chen Mo and Chen's wife to the Wuhou Temple, and witnessed him purchasing a folding fan from a calligraphy and painting stall, one side with landscape paintings and the other with calligraphy, bamboo bone, one foot long; slightly old.

At this point, the court announced that further investigation was needed and rescheduled the trial. A request for bail could be made in a separate application. The defendant was taken back into custody after meeting with his family.

### Black Hat Persistently Quibbles; Jiang Shiyan's Trial Concluded and Awaiting Sentence

[Report from Our Newspaper] Jiang Shiyan, the "Black Hat," who was assigned as a deputy squad leader in the Central China Railway Company case, beat a female passenger, Xu Peiwen, in March 1945, causing her death due to serious injuries. The case caused a sensation in Shanghai at the time. As a result, Jiang Shiyan was sentenced to life imprisonment by the puppet court. After the victory, the case was reinvestigated by the Prosecutor's Office of the Shanghai High Court, and a public prosecution was filed in accordance with the law. The High Court is currently hearing the case. The High Procuratorate has now filed an additional charge of treason against Jiang Shiyan, accusing him of holding a position in the puppet regime, abusing the power of the enemy and puppet regime, and killing travelers. The High Court heard the treason part of the case yesterday morning. The defendant, wearing a dark blue woolen cotton robe, gave extremely cunning testimony, only admitting to a verbal argument and denying that he beat Xu Peiwen to death. The court then presented the medical record from the Shanghai Sanatorium and the statements from the puppet police station and the local court to question him. The defendant prevaricated. After the defendant's lawyer, Zhang Yongqing, stood up to defend him, the court scheduled the sentencing for the 18th, and the defendant was taken back into custody.

[Report from Our Newspaper] A man named Du Zhenhuai, from Taizhou, Northern Jiangsu, runs a Guanmei Soy Sauce shop at 245 Yangjiadu Garbage Pond, Pudong. On November 6th of this year, a young man came to reside there, claiming to be Rui Weiyin, the deputy chairman of the Three People's Principles Youth League and a reporter for the News Agency (which was ordered to stop publishing in September). He accused Du of coming from Northern Jiangsu and being suspected of being a Communist, and extorted 5 million yuan from him. Du refused. The next day, the young man, accompanied by two military policemen, went to threaten him again. Du dealt with them evasively while reporting the information to the Yangjiadu Police Branch Bureau, which dispatched police to bring the three back for questioning. The two military policemen were immediately transferred to the Military Police Headquarters for handling, while Rui Weiyin was transferred to the District Procuratorate for interrogation yesterday.

### Okinawa's Inventory is Small and Old, Supply Bureau Stops Selling Jeeps

[Report from Our Newspaper] Jiang Biao, Director of the Executive Yuan's Materials Supply Bureau, went to Okinawa Island last week to inspect surplus US materials. It is reported that during this inspection, Director Jiang discovered that some materials, especially jeeps, were scarce and badly damaged, with missing parts that could not be repaired. Therefore, it is planned to return them to the US military authorities and not count them in the purchase. As a result, the bureau will stop selling jeeps. Currently, there are very few jeeps in Shanghai under repair, and they have already been pre-assigned, so the purchase orders of other applicants will be canceled.

In addition, the bureau currently has about 400 employees working at the surplus materials storage and processing center on Okinawa Island. All their supplies on the island need to be transported from here. As the number of hours is large, the bureau has prepared a large number of winter clothes, which will soon be sent to the island by personnel.

### The Desolate Hardware and Secondhand Goods Industry: Unbearable to Recall Mantingfang; The Prosperous Period Has Become a Thing of the Past

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] "Jin Yuli" (Golden Jade Lane), "Mantingfang" (Full Courtyard Lane), these names are beautiful enough—almost sarcastically. Entering through an archway-style gate, one finds a dirty, dark alley. Following the damp cobblestone road, turning west, and passing through a dimly lit teahouse, "Jin Yuli" ends, followed by "Mantingfang." It's not a full courtyard of fragrant flowers, but rather some dim, rusty yellow brass and white iron. Although this place is called a "fang" (lane), it's actually a narrow street, reaching Shilu in the west and Xishangling Street in the east. In this short street, doors are set up as shops, displaying many stalls selling scrap copper and old iron. These stalls are similar to the loads carried by small coppersmiths, but larger in area. From east to west, there are more than twenty of them. Some people, because they have no business, may rest for a day or two.

Stall History Exceeds Forty Years

The place has historical origins. According to the stall vendors, stalls have been set up here as far back as forty years ago. Initially, they sold incense candles and hardware. Slowly, the incense candle business declined, while the hardware business became increasingly prosperous, growing from small to large, from insignificant to significant. Some vendors became shop owners; some small stalls expanded into large stalls; some helpers became independent operators; some flew far away and became wealthy giants in the hardware industry. In short, the people here have passed down their trade from father to son, from teacher to disciple. After forty years of ups and downs, the name "Mantingfang" has become established. The stall vendor extended his hand from his sleeve and pointed to a hardware store across the street, saying, "That store used to be a stall, but later it became a store." I looked at the store. The storefront was small and the items were cluttered, but compared to the stalls, it was outstanding. The store owner might feel proud. After so many years of effort, he has finally acquired this family business, although this business, as it looks now, is still inevitably suffering from depression and decline.

Fragmentary and Numerous Varieties

The goods here are mostly fragmentary, such as huge steel pliers, small copper locks, hammers, drills, iron rods, files, etc... There are also machine parts and vehicle materials, etc. Because they are messy and cluttered, it is most suitable for stall vendors to sell them. People with vision may want to rummage through them. A discarded machine may be able to find a cheap part here and be reused; a broken car may be able to find what it needs here and drive again. However, these are all things of the past. Now, this place has become very desolate. The stall vendor said to me, "You've been here for half a day, have you seen a single stall make a sale?" Indeed, not only has there been no business, but there has not even been anyone asking. Even if someone buys a small part, it is just a drop in the bucket for them. Their hope is to clear out all their goods together and change to another industry. They are not satisfied with selling one or two items occasionally. Perhaps they are happier when reporters come to talk to them, allowing them to complain about their hardships!

Victory Arrives, Inventory Devalues

Starting in 1944, during the period when the enemy was scavenging scrap iron, seemed to be their prosperous period. Their goods were not subject to scavenging, and things were scarce and expensive. They really made a small fortune at that time, but after the victory, the puppet currency was converted at a rate of two hundred to one, and the inventory devalued, so the business immediately declined!

### More Foreign Ships Will Arrive in Shanghai; The Port Affairs Committee Decides to Prepare Properly to Cope with Congestion at Docks and Warehouses

### Reader Consultation: Medicine and Hygiene

(1) Peeling Hands

Asked by Xu Wenkui

I suffer from a skin disease on my hands. The palms are red and peeling, and one joint of my fingers cannot be straightened. The skin that is not peeling is firm, thick, rough, and dry. I don't know if it is tinea manus. How should it be treated?

[Answer from Dr. Zhang Zhongming] Your condition may be tinea manus, but there are many types of skin diseases. It is advisable to consult a doctor for a diagnosis and medication.

(2) Many Diseases in Postpartum Women

Wei Jifu asked: Two months after childbirth, the woman suddenly suffered from swollen feet. A hard, movable lump appeared on the side of her neck and has been growing larger. Local doctors say it is a scrofulous neck and have repeatedly treated it without success. Recently, another lump has appeared elsewhere. Please advise: (1) What is this disease? What is the cause? (2) The woman has not had her period for nine months. Is this related to the disease? (3) What kind of doctor should be consulted for this condition? (4) The woman has suffered from this disease for a long time and is weak and emaciated. Can she take tonics? What is suitable? (5) The child is nine months old, and the fontanelle on the top of his head is not yet closed. Is this a sign of congenital deficiency? Is it beneficial to take calcium supplements, Helevita drops, and milk powder? (6) Will the hard lump on the woman's neck harm the child's health if he drinks her milk?

[Answer from Dr. Zhang Zhongming] (1) This hard object is a swollen lymph node, and there are many causes, including tuberculosis, syphilis, and inflammation. (2) Women may temporarily stop menstruating while breastfeeding. (3) All public hospitals in Shanghai can treat this, and the fees are relatively low. (4) If the woman is weak and emaciated, she can take cod liver oil and other tonics. (5) The anterior fontanelle of children usually closes at the age of one year. Your son is only nine months old, and the anterior fontanelle has not yet closed, so it cannot be said to be a congenital deficiency. Calcium supplements, vitamin supplements, and milk powder are all good to take together, but avoid excessive amounts. (6) If the hard lump on the woman is infectious, it can infect the child.

### Thoroughly Eliminating the Black Market for Cotton Yarn; Specific Plan Principles Have Been Determined; Government Provides Foreign Exchange but Must Exchange Yarn for Cotton; Cotton Textile Association to Discuss Implementation Plan Today

[Our Dispatch] In order to thoroughly eliminate the black market for cotton yarn, Premier Song convened another meeting yesterday morning at 10:00 AM with Wu, the concurrent Chairman of the Textile Management Committee, Wang Qiyu, Wu Weijing, Rong Hongyuan, Rong Yixin, and others to discuss specific plans. It is heard that the general principles have been largely determined, and the main points are recorded as follows: (1) Raw materials: (A) Establish a review committee for the allocation of raw cotton, with Li Yu, Director of the Allocation Department of the Executive Committee of the Women's Management Committee, and one representative from national and private yarn factories each serving as members. (B) Within the permitted import quota of raw cotton, each yarn factory is allowed to allocate it themselves. (2) Finished products: In principle, it is stipulated that yarn be exchanged for cotton. In other words, the government provides foreign exchange for purchasing cotton and, at the same time, recovers a portion of the cotton yarn at a negotiated price. If there is a surplus, it will still be for the free trade of each yarn factory. (3) Unify the business operations of national and private yarn factories. In addition to the Textile Construction Company, which has already resumed the listing system, the opening of yarn by private factories should be centralized at the Sixth District Cotton Textile Association. The association will still organize a distribution committee to list and open yarn for sale. (4) Before each opening of yarn, the standard price of each type of yarn should be negotiated based on its quality and type, under the principle of being lower than the market price. Price negotiations should adopt a flexible method, which can be adjusted according to market needs and the factory's own yarn inventory.

The Sixth District Cotton Textile Association, in accordance with the instructions of Premier Song, convened a meeting of the standing directors yesterday morning at 11:00 AM. Wang Qiyu, Wu Weijing, Rong Hongyuan, Tang Xinghai, Liu Jingji, Guo Qiong, and others attended. The principles decided at the meeting convened by Premier Song were made into a plan to be submitted to the regular meeting of the Textile Management Committee, which will be held at 3:00 PM on the 12th, for discussion. At the same time, the detailed implementation rules were also studied.

According to a person concerned who spoke to a reporter: The government's opening of foreign exchange settlement for American cotton imports will be handled on a quarterly basis (i.e., three months). Based on the current production volume of cotton yarn in China, the permitted import quota for each quarter is estimated to be approximately 200,000 to 300,000 bales. At that time, in order to promote domestic cotton, the government will allocate a certain proportion of domestic cotton based on the number of American cotton purchase applications. Furthermore, according to observations: If the yarn-for-cotton system is implemented, the government will be able to provide the textile industry with a large amount of raw cotton and, therefore, also be able to easily obtain a large amount of cotton yarn. Although there will still be a surplus for each factory to trade freely, it will be relatively small. Therefore, it is expected that the future trend of yarn prices will undoubtedly be stable. At the same time, from now on, national and private yarn factories will take the same steps in opening yarn for sale, and price negotiations will adopt a flexible method. Therefore, it is expected that the black market for cotton yarn can be eradicated as a result.

### Flour Mills Difficult to Maintain; Lack of Raw Materials and Price Limits Insufficient to Cover Costs

The flour milling industry in this city is second only to the cotton textile industry. The flour mills in the city have 4,800 large mills, 102 small mills, 114 motors, and 10,200 horsepower. Currently, due to power restrictions, production has been greatly reduced. According to a major player in the industry, production is limited on the one hand by electricity, so that all factories cannot operate at full capacity, and on the other hand by raw materials. The wheat required for flour production is insufficient in China and relies heavily on imports. Countries have restricted exports, so the source has become more problematic. If there are no more imports of foreign wheat, then some factories may stop operating next year. In addition, the manufacturing cost of the industry is very high, and the price limit is low, so it is difficult for factories to maintain operations.

### Factory Buildings Used as Mortgages; Relevant Authorities Are Studying

National banks provide industrial loans, and the restrictions on collateral are very strict.

Regarding collateral, the Four Banks Joint Treasury has recently decided that machinery can also be used as part of the collateral.

### Rice Market Without Much Change; Coarse Grains More Dynamic

The results of Southern Japonica are not very changing, and the trend of flour is also quite softening. Wheat bran is still declining as usual. There are slightly more transactions on Soybean Cake, and it has rebounded by 100 to 200 yuan. Yellow soybeans are collected by merchants and picked up by oil factories, and the market has stopped.

High-quality sesame is scarce, and Guangdong merchants have a very strong stomach, forming a situation where high-quality goods are cut down and settled down. The oil market is recently because the weather has turned cold, and most raw oil has frozen, so the sales are not good, and the turnover is small, 2,000 to 3,000 yuan, the market situation is fluctuating. Soybean oil is still abundant, and there is no change. Sesame oil has become a settled fall, and there is also little honor or disgrace.

### Silk Weaving Industry Requests Loans; Total Amount is 66 Billion Yuan; Each Loom Mortgages 12 Billion Yuan; Is Presenting a Petition to the Government Authorities for Assistance

[Our Dispatch] The electric silk weaving industry in this city is in a difficult situation and has submitted a document to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Four Banks Joint Treasury, requesting the government to provide assistance in terms of loans and orders. On the lending measures, the industry's specific requirements are:

I. Relax the number of loans and mortgage measures as follows:

A. The total amount of the loan is 66 billion yuan, and each loom is lent 12 million yuan. (The total number of looms is estimated to be 5,500)

B. Each loom and equipment mortgages 6 million yuan, semi-finished products on the machine mortgage 4 million yuan, and finished products on the machine mortgage 2 million yuan, totaling the above number. (If there are no semi-finished products or the number of finished products on the machine is insufficient, it will be calculated based on the actual amount)

C. Use of loans

(1) To repay old debts and high-interest loans

(2) To purchase raw materials

(3) To pay wages and other payments

Other than the above three items, it must not be used for other purposes

D. The interest rate is in accordance with the silk cocoon loan precedent, with a monthly interest rate of 2.2%.

II. Accepting orders from state-owned agencies will follow the same industry practice of releasing materials for weaving on behalf of the state-owned agencies. The state-owned agencies will issue raw materials to customize silk loans that meet export standards, and the detailed measures will be specified in a separate agreement.

In terms of ordering, the industry association recommends that the factory silk stored in the China Trust Bureau be processed by the industry's factories and transported to Nanyang, the United States, and Canada to develop overseas markets. The presentation also pointed out: The price of rayon distributed by the China Trust Bureau is 2.8 million yuan per box, while the price of the government's barter trade with Japan is only 500,000 yuan per box according to the Hong Kong market price, and the profit is more than 2 million yuan per box. As of now, the manufacturers have purchased 5,400 boxes from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and 4,300 boxes from the China Trust Bureau, for a total profit of 20 billion yuan for the government. Therefore, if the National Bureau of Travel can release a number at this time, it is really "taking from the same industry and using it in the same industry." Shareholders also expressed: If it is not approved, then the factory has no other way but to close down, and only the entire factory assets, machinery and more than 20,000 workers and staff will be transferred to the state for proper placement.

### Weakness in Early Morning Trading of Chinese Stocks, Strong Buying in the Afternoon

After the opening, No. 70 and No. 145 progressed in spot Yong Sha, and No. 151 and No. 92 progressed in current Yong Sha, showing a brief surge, rising by ten yuan. However, beyond 420 yuan for forward Yong Sha, it couldn't sustain. No. 173, No. 215, No. 152, and No. 16 quickly competed to sell, dropping to around 405 yuan. After slight purchases by No. 199, No. 87, and No. 99, it was still difficult to hold above 410 yuan. With No. 180, No. 61, and No. 160 coming to sell, it was pushed down again to the 400 yuan mark. After struggling, No. 89 seized the opportunity to pressure the price, breaking through the 400 yuan barrier. No. 186 also sold, signaling a decline. After No. 89 arbitrarily suppressed the price, spot Yong Sha immediately saw a low price of 390 yuan. No. 160, No. 215, No. 16, No. 229, No. 102, and No. 180 took advantage of the low price to buy in, causing a slight rebound. However, No. 89, No. 142, and No. 31 continued to sell, liquidating floating profits, pushing the price down again near noon. No. 180 bought in on dips, and No. 38, No. 151, and No. 44 came in to buy, stabilizing slightly before closing.

In forward trading, Yong Sha, Xin He, and Qin Xing fell by half a percentage point, Mei Ya fell by a little less than one percentage point, while Hua Xing, Jing Fu, and Xin Guang saw slight declines. After the market opened in the afternoon at a flat level, buying was boosted by gold and banknotes. No. 232, No. 233, No. 213, No. 224, No. 199, and No. 145 successively bought, and the buying sentiment was overwhelming. Outside the market, Cantonese traders bought enthusiastically, and "cross-trading" houses rushed to cover their positions in the market. Thus, news such as the abolition of price limits on yarn and cloth, the success of Sino-American loans, and changes in foreign exchange rates abounded. The buying frenzy became even more intense near the close, soaring by more than thirty yuan and ending at a high price. After the close, there were still calls for higher prices. Compared to the previous close, Yong Sha, Xin He, and Jing Fu rose by half a percentage point, Mei Ya was flat, Hua Feng and Xin Guang rose by a little less than one percentage point, Qin Xing rebounded by one percentage point, and the unpopular stock, Matches, rose to the limit.

### National Assembly Education Representatives Hu Shi and Others Submit Recommendations, Requesting the Government to Pay Attention to Education Issues

[Our Nanjing Dispatch] National Assembly representatives from the liberal professions and the education sector, including Hu Shi, Cao Ju, Ye Suzhong, Ge Wei, Yang Zhan, Huang Zhaoxiong, Chen Bai, Zhou Feicheng, Jiang Jianbai, Zhou Houchu, Wang Ziyu, Wang Yizhou, Xu Tonghe, Zhu Jingnong, Chen Xifang, Liang Xianda, Zhang Yi, and Ruan Zhidao, a total of eighteen people, have made suggestions to the National Assembly, requesting the government to pay attention to major issues currently related to education. The original suggestions are recorded as follows: Education is the foundation of a nation and the basis for implementing democratic politics. As the Constitution is being formulated and the government is about to return power to the people, it is especially important to promote education widely, so that the people have the ability to implement the Constitution and exercise political power. In addition to having inclusive and adaptable provisions for education in the Constitution, so that the basic policies of the country can be promoted without hindrance, we must express our views on important matters in education, so that the government can adopt them in educational facilities, and we hope that those in society who care about education will show sympathy, unanimously advocate, and promote their realization.

Use Specialists and Improve Efficiency

First, the government should employ specialists to handle education: In modern times, education has become a specialized discipline, and educational undertakings are particularly professional in general society. Therefore, those who handle education must have specialized knowledge and experience. Currently, those engaged in educational administration and teaching lack knowledge and experience. Most people still think that educational administration and educational undertakings can be done by everyone, and that anyone can be a teacher. Therefore, various elements enter together, and no achievements are made, and education is not valued. These errors must be corrected immediately. The government must carefully appoint educational administrators at all levels, and the education authorities must pay attention to employing specialists related to the education they handle. Primary and secondary school teachers should be filled by those who have received teacher training, so that educational efficiency can be improved, and the mission of education can be gradually accomplished.

Allocate Enemy and Puppet Industry to Fund Expenses

Second, the government should allocate large sums of money to actively handle education: During the War of Resistance, education and culture were most severely damaged. Since the victory, the restoration of education and culture has been most slow. The society has failed to provide widespread assistance, and the government has failed to do its best. In the entire economic system, some people often only see the consumption of education and forget the contribution of education to the future of the country, resulting in the inability of most destroyed schools to be restored, the inability of schools to be added, and countless children and youth wandering the streets with no schools to attend. The situation is extremely serious. The central government should take a long-term view and regard the restoration of education and the addition of schools as its unshirkable responsibility. It should immediately allocate large sums of money to subsidize the restoration of public and private schools at all levels and to add new schools to accommodate out-of-school children and youth and to reverse the current decline. Furthermore, the property of enemies, puppets, and traitors in various places should be allocated to educational expenses, because the property of enemies and puppets mostly comes from the exploitation of the people, and using it for education best meets the wishes of the people.

Restore County Education Bureaus Early

Third, the government should restore county education bureaus early and provide large subsidies for local education: Local education below the county level has been disrupted due to the destruction by enemies and puppets and the impact of financial centralization. The promotion of universal education has also been delayed, and the independent spirit of the original educational funding has been completely destroyed. It has also been diverted for other purposes in large quantities. For example, the original local educational funding was 40% or 50% or more before the war, but now it has dropped to about 10%. The original educational funding was already not abundant. Looking at the current situation of local education, school equipment is simple and insufficient for teaching, teachers' salaries are low, with monthly incomes of 40,000 or 50,000 yuan, which cannot even maintain their personal lives. Excellent teachers have changed careers, and unqualified personnel account for more than 300,000 of the 600,000 teachers, and even primary school graduates are employed as primary school teachers, with more than 80,000 people. The serious situation is self-evident. In the future, on the one hand, provinces should be ordered to restore county education bureaus from the 36th year, and on the other hand, the system of guaranteeing local educational funding should be restored, and it must be used for specific purposes only. On one hand, the central government should increase subsidies for local national education funding, and it should bear at least one-quarter of the cost in order to achieve universal education as soon as possible.

Reward Private Schools and Subsidize Them

Fourth, the government should vigorously support and subsidize private education undertakings: Currently, the number of schools run by private individuals in China accounts for more than one-third of public schools, which shows that private education has greatly benefited the national education undertaking. Since the victory, the government has turned a deaf ear to private education undertakings. Some excellent private schools have been unable to rebuild, and the government has not provided substantial assistance. This is a major defect in education. Private school teachers and staff are also national public educators, but they have not enjoyed the same treatment as the nation. We sincerely hope that the government will attach equal importance to education undertakings, regardless of public or private, reward and subsidize private schools, and give private school teachers the same treatment. As for private schools that were destroyed in the War of Resistance and still want to restore the school, we sincerely hope that the government will provide substantial assistance.

Quickly Increase Teacher Salaries

Fifth, the government should increase teachers' salaries: Educational personnel, whether engaged in national education or other levels of education, hold the hub of the nation's new life. Recently, due to high prices and difficult living conditions, teachers at all levels have felt pain, especially primary school teachers. If teachers cannot have enough to eat, how can educational efficiency be achieved? Currently, the phenomenon of teachers at all levels changing careers and retreating has become widespread. If we do not actively reverse this, it can cause extremely serious consequences. We hope that the government will have the greatest determination, make the greatest decision, and quickly increase teachers' salaries, so that they can meet the needs of actual local life, and increase them as the cost of living increases, so that they can feel at ease and specialize.

Strictly Order the Return of Occupied School Buildings

Sixth, the government should strictly supervise and order the return of school buildings that have been occupied: At the beginning of the victory, the order was not stable, and many troops and administrative agencies occupied school buildings and the houses of national cultural institutions. When order was restored, education should be restored at the same time, but the occupied school buildings often do not return for a long time, so that ten schools cannot be restored soon. Although the government has issued orders, they have not been thoroughly implemented. We hope that the government will strictly order its subordinates to seriously handle this matter and return them immediately, so as not to cause resentment in the education community.

When necessary, senior adult classes and women's classes may also be established. (Article 7) The curriculum, teaching materials, equipment, teachers and staff, and all other facilities of the substitute national school shall be handled in accordance with the rules of national schools and central national schools.

(Article 9) After a private school is converted into a substitute national school, if the original board of directors of the private primary school is unwilling to continue operating and is willing to donate all of the school's property to the public, its substitute nature may be revoked and it may be converted into a national school. (Article 10) These regulations shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.

The "Summer Camp Training Record" and the inaugural issue of the "National Education Counseling Monthly" will also be published this month.

### The First Pudong Cross-Country Race: Over 10,000 Meters, Route Announced Yesterday, Registration Very Enthusiastic

Jia Yiwei Jun, the police chief of the Yangjing district in Pudong of this city, recognizing that Pudong, adjacent to the urban area, lacked widespread sports activities, specifically organized the Jinghua Sports Association and held the first cross-country race. Since registration began, participation has been very enthusiastic. As of yesterday, there were already over forty participants. Lou Wen'ao and Wan Jinsheng, renowned long-distance runners from the 6th Corps Sports Association, have also registered to participate. The race is scheduled to take place on the morning of the 15th of this month (Sunday) at 9:00 AM, with a total length of over 10,000 meters. The starting point is in front of the Dongchang Sports Association on the Police Bureau Road, proceeding via Lanni Du Road, turning into Dongchang Road, crossing Zhuangjia Bridge, heading south via Shanjia Bridge, turning east into Shenjia Nong Cao'an, reaching Qinci Yangdian Temple, then heading north via the No. 6 Bridge of Jiu'an Cemetery, turning west to Qichang Zhan, Yangjia Zhai, heading north to Beihu Tang Road, then turning into Lanni Du Road, returning via Shantang Road to the Dongchang Sports Association on Police Bureau Road for the finish line. All participants who complete the entire course will each receive a medal. The top ten finishers with excellent results will receive additional prizes as encouragement. Those who aspire to compete but have not yet registered can register at the following two locations before 5:00 PM today: (1) 347 Dongda Ming Road, 6th Corps Sports Association, (2) Dongchang Sports Association on the Police Bureau Road in Pudong.

### University Ball Game Referee Issues

A Good Teacher Should Be a Good Referee

This Saturday, the University Football League will resume, and Fudan and Soochow will compete again. The venue and referee have both been changed. Although it was not the players and referees who participated in the brawls during the first game, it cannot be denied that the referee's unfamiliarity with the techniques was the source of the dispute. Chen Ling had stated at the first meeting of university sports directors that after ten years in the interior, he was no longer familiar with football refereeing and was prone to mistakes. However, the other directors present at the meeting believed that it was an insult for a university sports director not to be able to serve as a referee. Shen Kunnan, the Fudan sports director, also believed that a good sports instructor is not necessarily a good referee, and vice versa, a good referee is not necessarily a good sports teacher. Therefore, serious consideration should be given to the referee's qualifications before a game. When a reporter met with Fudan President Zhang Yi the day before yesterday, President Zhang also believed that the university ball game should invite people from the referee association to referee. However, we hope that the sports directors who teach at the university will also pay attention to refereeing in addition to teaching sports. Of course, "a good teacher is not necessarily a good referee," but "a good teacher should be a good referee." As university sports are currently unfolding, we should have no objections.

### Hong Kong Basketball Level Is Low: Qingbai Team Can Win All

Basketball Committee Chairman Qian Xucang Returns to Shanghai and Talks

Qian Xucang, chairman of the Shanghai Sports Association Basketball Committee, flew to Hong Kong on the same plane with the Qingbai Expedition Basketball Team on the 2nd of this month. It has been ten days since then. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Qian returned to Shanghai from Guangzhou by China Airlines plane. Due to weather conditions, it did not land at Longhua Airport until 5:05 PM. He immediately drove back to his residence. According to his conversation with reporters: Among the ball sports in Hong Kong Island, football is more active than any other sport, and the level is the highest in the country. However, the level of basketball is lower than that of Shanghai. Therefore, the Qingbai Basketball Team has won three consecutive victories as of yesterday. Based on the situation, it is expected that they will be able to return in triumph with a complete victory. The Qingbai Football Team, when he left Hong Kong, in addition to being defeated by Xingdong in the first game, there was still a game in the afternoon yesterday. It is expected that all games will be completed around the 16th of this month.

When asked about the Shanghai Star Expedition to Hong Kong, Qian said: He has contacted Mr. Zhong Zhiqiang, chairman of the local basketball association and sports director of the youth association, and it has been arranged properly. The Hong Kong side hopes that the Shanghai Star Team will arrive in Hong Kong around the 24th, so a meeting will be held in the next few days to discuss the expedition.

### Badminton Committee

Discuss Team Formation and Venues Tomorrow

The Shanghai Sports Association Badminton Committee will hold a meeting tomorrow at 6:00 PM in the Shanghai Stadium Conference Room to discuss the team formation and venue allocation for the badminton league.

It is also hoped that the players of the four teams will bring their rackets and shoes to practice at the stadium at the same time. The notice has been issued, but it is feared that the mail will be delayed and will not be delivered in time. It is hoped that the four teams Qianghua, Yefeng, Kangle, and Liangyou will pay attention.

### Wuxi Industry Moves Forward Against the Headwinds of Recession

— Our Reporter Ding Weidong

Three Pillars: Cotton Mills, Flour Mills, Silk Mills

The degree of industrialization in Wuxi is second only to Shanghai on the Beijing-Shanghai Line. The amount of electricity used by industry is enough to prove this fact. The Qi Yao power plant sends 8,000 horsepower of power to Wuxi industry every day. The amount cannot be considered low, but the power shortage is still a problem. Large industries have enough power with difficulty, and many small industries that arose during the war have to install their own power generation equipment at a considerable cost. According to the power plant engineers, to meet the full needs of Wuxi industry, I am afraid that another 8,000 horsepower of power will have to be added every day! And this is only the current situation. With the current high profits of cotton mills and the diligence and pragmatism of Wuxi people, there are quite a few people who are planning to expand. Those who have ordered spindles overseas will continue to come in the next year or two. As such, the production capacity will expand, and the need for electricity will be even more urgent. If we take this as a measure, we can see that the future of Wuxi's industrialization is truly limitless!

The three pillars of Wuxi industry are: cotton mills, flour mills, and silk mills. Due to objective environmental reasons, the prosperity and decline of these three types of industries today are vastly different. During my short journey, I had contact with people from all three industries and gained a general understanding of the difficulties and prospects of each industry. Now I will try to make a comprehensive report in the order of cotton, flour, and silk industries.

### Lucky Cotton Industry: No One Can Fail to Make Huge Profits as Long as They Manage Well

The cotton spinning industry is undoubtedly the darling of heaven among the difficult Chinese industries today. The demand is high and production is insufficient, the black market price is high and the raw materials are relatively cheap, and regardless of whether it is a large or small factory, as long as it is well managed, there is no one that does not make a lot of money. The price of cotton yarn in Wuxi is not limited, and the selling price is about 2.3 million yuan per bale, and the prosperity of the yarn weaving industry can be imagined. As for the cotton mills in the city, the larger in scale and more in output, there are Shenxin No. 3 Factory and other companies. Please refer to the attached table below:

The equipment in other smaller cotton mills with one or two thousand spindles is still more than ten. The above table lists the highest number of equipment in each factory. In fact, many were destroyed during the war, and some are still in the process of being repaired. Not so many are in operation today. How many spindles are spinning in Wuxi today? There are two estimates: one is about 100,000 spindles, and the other is about 110,000 spindles. This means that the current production of yarn is only about 60% of that before the war. At the beginning of the War of Resistance, when the enemy occupied Wuxi, they deeply hated the Chinese textile industry, which hindered the national policy of "industrial Japan, agricultural China." The 70,000 spindles of Shenxin No. 3 Factory were systematically destroyed, leaving only 10,000 spindles! As for the 1,478 looms, they were all destroyed and nothing remained. Shenxin's fate was like this, and the fate of other major factories was similar. However, one year after the victory of the War of Resistance, although the country is in turmoil and the social economy is turbulent, I have been able to witness that Shenxin has been able to recover to 50,000 spindles, and the weaving factory has begun to be equipped in the burnt factory building, and there may be 500 looms running in December. Workers and staff are working with the same enthusiasm under the brilliant electric light; other factories also have the prospect and expectation of tomorrow. The past experience seems to be just a nightmare, and everything disappeared with the victory. I deeply feel that the Chinese people's endurance and vitality are the strongest reliance to overcome all difficulties. The raw materials for the cotton mills in Wuxi are mainly American cotton, and sometimes Brazilian cotton is used. Before the war, they were able to produce fine yarn of 40 counts and 60 counts, but now the machines are damaged and they can only spin coarse yarn of 20 counts and 30 counts. The treatment of workers is also better than that of other industries, generally from 80,000 to 320,000, and the treatment of skilled workers can also reach 500,000 to 600,000 yuan. Their wages are calculated according to the cost of living. A friend in the factory told me! It is probably 80% of the wages in Shanghai. There are far fewer labor disputes in Wuxi than in Shanghai. There are two reasons: most of the main technicians in the major cotton mills have served for many years, shared hardships together, and have been together for a long time, gradually developing feelings. Even if they have any requests, they will come out of goodwill and negotiation, and rarely appear in the form of strikes. Second, Wuxi is not comparable to Shanghai. The local situation is simpler, and there is no large-scale organization and manipulation attempt for workers, so the situation is more stable. Recently, workers in Wuxi, in view of the high cost of living, requested to increase the basic salary by half. The capitalists will take a negative attitude on this matter, so it is difficult to predict whether the labor-capital relationship will be like before in the future. As for the efficiency of technicians, a factory owner said that it is only 70% or 80% of that before the war. It is not physical weakness, but a change in mentality, feeling that technicians are welcomed everywhere, "If this place doesn't keep me, there will be a place to keep me," so discipline is gone, and the teaching can be reduced. I usually feel deeply that in the current industrial situation in our country, in addition to the abnormally prosperous cotton spinning industry, the burden of wages will suffocate the national industry; but it is impossible to reduce wages today, so the only remedy is how to improve workers' sense of responsibility and enable them to spontaneously improve work efficiency.

### Flour Industry Is Gloomy

Compared with the cotton yarn industry, the flour mills and silk mills appear dim, and the latter is in a crisis of raw material shortage. Flour was originally the main industry in Wuxi before the war. The famous Rong family started with flour, and a piece of stone mill used when they started their business is still displayed as a family heirloom. During the nine years of the War of Resistance, due to the enemy and puppet control of food, Wuxi experienced a deformed prosperity. At that time, there were not a few people who raised funds to open flour mills. Today, the flour mills with a certain scale in the area are Maoxin, Guangfeng, and Zhenhua, among others, and there are more than ten others with smaller scales. The current recession is mainly due to three reasons: (1) Insufficient power supply makes it impossible to fully develop productivity, but expenses cannot be saved. According to an estimate by a gentleman in this industry: the current daily output of flour in Wuxi is only about 10,000 bags, but if there is enough electricity, it can be increased to 25,000 bags. This is quite reliable. In Maoxin No. 2 Factory, 8,000 bags of flour could be produced every day before the war, but now the output has been sharply reduced due to lack of electricity. 5,000 bags are produced on the first day, and 2,500 bags are produced on the second day, and the cycle repeats. The situation in other factories is similar. (2) The supply of raw materials mostly came from northern Jiangsu in the past, but due to the occupation of the area by the Communist army, the supply is not smooth, which affects production. (3) The current general recession in the grain industry is not an exception for the flour industry; the result is that the price of raw materials rises, while the selling price of flour does not rise, and there is no profit to be made. Under the above three unfavorable conditions, the current production of the flour industry is only 30% to 40% of that before the war. At the same time, the burden of taxation also makes the industry shrink. Now each bag of flour has to be taxed 400 yuan for goods tax, and there is also income tax and profit tax at the end of the year. A flour mill director told the reporter that the monthly tax expenditure is much larger than the salaries and food expenses of the employees. Under the current situation of poor sales, small factories are deeply troubled by high-interest loans, and one or two may announce liquidation at the end of the year.

### Silk Industry Crisis Is More Serious Than Flour Mills

The crisis of the silk industry in Wuxi is even more serious than that of the flour mills. There were 40 silk mills in the area before the war, and more than 20 small factories were established during the nine years of the War of Resistance, with a total of more than 60 factories employing more than 20,000 workers. Those with more equipment are shown in the table below:

Factory Name Number of Machines

Bada 156

China Silk No. 6 Factory 304

Zhengmao 104

Yongchang 114

Jincheng 272

Meixin 296

Yongtai 312

Dingxin 256

Jiangnan First Filature Factory 360

All these silk mills, regardless of size, are currently in a raw material panic. If the import of spring cocoons from Vietnam cannot become a reality, all of them will stop work before the end of this month. When autumn silk is on the market next year, cost will become the most serious problem. At present, the government's purchase price is 3.8 million yuan per dan (standard silk), but the cost of autumn silk is estimated to be more than 6 million yuan per dan; they are generally grateful for the government's intention to support the silk industry; they hope that the future purchase price can be adjusted again according to the actual cost. As for the export of raw silk, they have a common view: our silk production has two major weaknesses: the variety is not as good as others, so the quality of silk is also poor; second, the wages are too high, so the production cost of silk is also high; in the short term, we are still difficult to compete with the strong enemy Japan.

### A Productive City [Many Producers, Few Consumers]

The current situation and prospects of the three main industries in Wuxi have been briefly described above. Compared with other places, it makes people feel hopeful. This is true of industry, and so is commerce. Of course, Wuxi's commerce is also in a recession, and closures are also happening. On the day the reporter arrived in Wuxi, a large pharmacy was forced to close by high-interest loans, and a rice shop with a history of more than ten years was struggling with a debt of 700 million yuan. The situation is terrible enough. However, the wealthy people in Wuxi use their money to run businesses instead of lending at high interest rates for enjoyment, which has a very good impact after all. Because once a business is established, it employs a lot of people, and other industries also increase prosperity due to the so-called "multiplier effect" in economics. Therefore, the unemployment situation in Wuxi is better than in other places. At the same time, because it is a productive place, the people's purchasing power is stronger, so even in the headwinds of commercial recession, the market situation is still good. As for the lives of farmers in Wuxi, they are not as good as before. In the past, they had two incomes every year, one from rice and one from sericulture, and their lives were not bad. Since the year one cut down mulberry trees and planted rice, who knows that the rise in rice prices cannot be proportional to other prices! A farmer's hard work for a year cannot even afford one or two clothes. The major economic contradiction in our country now is: if the price of rice is raised, the price of labor will inevitably rise. Factories will not be able to maintain; conversely, if the price of rice is not raised, the lives of 80% of the farmers will inevitably decline day by day, their purchasing power will be weak, and commerce will not prosper. I asked this question to a friend from a Wuxi cotton mill. His opinion is: "In the past, the government worked hard to stabilize prices, but neglected labor prices; in the future, we should work hard to reduce labor prices in order to solve the problem."

Wuxi is a productive city, and there are very few idlers, "many producers, few consumers," so it can not only support itself, but also export surplus materials. The reason why it can do this is because the natural environment is one reason, but the main reason is the human effort. The people's thrift, pragmatism, and focus on utilizing resources have finally made Wuxi a "Little Shanghai" - a productive city with the advantages of Shanghai but without the disadvantages of Shanghai. If one-third of the cities in China can concentrate the wisdom and talent of the people and develop in productive undertakings like the people of Wuxi, the reporter believes that the goal of improving people's lives will be achieved earlier.

### Enterprising Spirit: Repairing the Wounds of War and Striving to Expand Business

The industrial circles in Wuxi have a very strong enterprising spirit. Their greatest advantage is that they live frugally, do not engage in extravagance, and use all their energy to develop their businesses. At present, most factories have development plans, not only to repair the wounds of war, but also to strive to expand their professions. In terms of the cotton industry, both large and small factories are placing orders overseas. For example, Shenxin Cotton Mill had 70,000 spindles before the war, and suffered heavy losses during the war. Now it has only recovered to 50,000 spindles, but they are now planning to increase to 126,000 spindles! On the eve of the end of the war, they ordered from American manufacturers, and it is expected that a part of them can be shipped in the spring. The other yarn factories ordered later, and there are only three factories in the United States that can manufacture spinning machines, and their own needs are also large; therefore, within a year, the production of yarn factories in Wuxi will not be greatly improved. In terms of flour mills, a temporary recession is not enough to discourage progressive industrialists, on the contrary, they have also set far-reaching development plans. For example, Maoxin No. 2 Factory is planning to purchase machines and establish a large factory in Wuxi with a daily output of 10,000 bags of flour; at the same time, Maoxin No. 1 Factory is also adding new British-made flour milling machines used during the war, and the output performance is particularly good. All of this shows their enterprising spirit.

### Power Issues

Insufficient power has limited industrial production in the Wuxi area, but this problem is being successfully resolved. The reasons for the power shortage in Wuxi are varied. Firstly, many small industries have sprung up in the past decade, and they all require electricity. Secondly, before the war, major factories all had their own generators. However, during these turbulent years, some generators were lost, while others were left unused. This additional electricity burden has affected the overall supply and demand balance. As for the power supply from the Qishuyan Power Plant, it has not been reduced at all because the wartime machinery was undamaged. The Shenxin Textile Factory's generators are currently being borrowed by the power company to supply electricity to Wuxi. However, this is still not enough. Many small factories cannot get electricity and have to generate their own. Large factories also have limited electricity consumption. If they exceed the limit, they must supply coal to the Qishuyan Power Plant as compensation. Now, with the efforts of all parties, major textile factories will be able to resume their own power generation by next spring, and the Qishuyan Power Plant will also receive supplies from the Executive Yuan's generators and British wartime generators. The power supply capacity will also be increased. Therefore, the problem of insufficient power in Wuxi can be completely resolved in two or three months. In the past and present electricity distribution and dispatch, the Qishuyan Power Plant has indeed worked hard and diligently.

### The First Key Artery of the Lifeline: Snapshots of Changchun

— November 28th Airmail Report by Our Changchun Reporter Fang Ren

Changchun is currently a patient suffering from anemia, a seriously ill person with paralysis on both sides and ravaged by numerous ailments, a desert, and some even say a stagnant pool.

Native-Born, Native-Grown: Senators Dare to Speak

First of all, the reporter must thank the establishment of the Changchun Provisional Senate. It allows me, as an audience member in the venue, to hear those who are "eloquent" report on their actual life experiences in recent years, or, to put it more seriously, report on their actual work situation in recent years.

The Changchun Provisional Senate was formally established on November 22nd. After its establishment, it continued to hold general meetings, which have not yet adjourned. There are a total of 31 senators in this assembly. Eight of them are from the countryside because there are eight districts in Changchun that fall within the city limits, but are inhabited entirely by farmers who make a living by farming. There are also representatives elected by labor unions, and their proposals and inquiries invariably emphasize the interests of workers as more sacred than the interests represented by any other representative. Elementary school teachers desperately exaggerate matters related to elementary school students. There are also two white-bearded elders who insist that the city government's five-hundred-person chorus of male and female middle school students on Double Tenth Day was "indecent" and that the mixing of sexes was too unrefined. What's more, several young lads, when discussing the proposal to eliminate superstition, shouted loudly, ordering the complete shutdown of factories that made joss paper and "shantytowns" that made paper figures of people and horses, because they were the main culprits in promoting the existence of superstition! The reporter wants to particularly emphasize this point: Indeed, some of the senators are people who have not seen much of the world. They are not only native-born and raised in Northeast China but also native-born and raised in the rural areas of Northeast China. However, they dare to speak boldly. One thing is a pity: among the 31 senators, there is not a single woman. Strangely, the female citizens in the audience have also been as rare as morning stars in recent days.

### Two Slogans: Production is More Important Than Taxation; Developing Resources is More Important Than Cutting Costs

Relying solely on taxation is not a viable method. Therefore, Director Xiao Renshu proposed two "slogans" as the standard for today's efforts to solve Changchun's financial problems: "Production is more important than taxation; developing resources is more important than cutting costs." What does developing production and resources mean? According to Xiao's opinion: (1) Open up production enterprises, because although Changchun does not occupy an important position in the production enterprises of Northeast China, it is secondary; and most of these were contributed and established by the hard work of the citizens, so a part of it should be taken out for the enjoyment of the general public. For example, if the Changchun Cigarette Factory were operated by the city government, the city government's expenses could be greatly improved, but this factory was taken over by the Jilin Provincial Government. (2) Under the arrangement of real estate rent, a monthly income of 20 to 30 million yuan is not a problem, but what belongs to the central government has been taken over by the central government; and what does not belong to the central government has been taken over by the Real Estate Management Bureau. (3) Establishing a municipal bank can make capital more active, unlike the National Bank, which is subject to excessive restrictions. The municipal bank can transfer existing funds from the four major banks, which will naturally make the market prosper and the city government's finances will naturally benefit from it. (4) Rectify tax collection so that municipal tax revenues can be fully credited to the public, which will greatly benefit the city government. (5) Establish a trading market to prevent taxes on livestock and grain from being evaded. (6) Make good use of post-war relief supplies. (7) Promote the circulation of materials and strive to meet the requirements of smooth flow of goods.

### Police Reform: The Authorities Spare No Effort

In Northeast China, due to the influence of the enemy and puppet regimes, "police" is always used interchangeably with "secret agents." When people mention "police" and "secret agents," people in Northeast China cannot help but feel disgusted and resentful. Because in the hands of the "police" and "secret agents," under the names of "ideological criminals" and "economic criminals," countless people were separated from their parents, children from their parents, and wives from their husbands. They were the hatchet men raised by the Japanese, the creators of human tragedies of life and death, the demons who killed without batting an eye, and the utter bastards who only knew themselves and not others.

After the central government took over Northeast China, the most headache-inducing thing was the establishment of a new police administration. Because to make the people of Northeast China change their minds, one must first try to completely eliminate all the bad habits of the past police and let these pro-people police officers gain new recognition from the people through new behaviors.

After the National Army entered Changchun at the end of May, considerable effort was put into rectifying the police administration. In addition to establishing a police training school on July 1, which has now trained three classes, totaling 547 police officers, daily training is also implemented, with two hours of training each day, as well as training during memorial weeks and various gatherings. However, after the police report, all the senators stood up enthusiastically to question, saying that on November 24, the police, while on patrol duty in the early morning, shot and killed an old man named Fu Shuming, who was holding a pickaxe and prying open the floor of an empty house near the Xiyang District. The police said that because they saw Fu approaching with an object, "the scene was not good, so they opened fire," which is indeed suspected of major negligence of human life. In addition, the police also accepted civil and criminal lawsuits in the suburban countryside, randomly beat and detained people, and judged matters of "marriage and land" in a complete mess.

### The Karma of the Big-Nosed Soldiers: Forming Pain Between Young Couples

In the police report, there was a report that everyone paid special attention to. That report was a statistical figure, which was the result of an investigation into some of the things that the people of Changchun were unwilling to experience after the Soviet army entered Changchun. The statistics are: 28 cases of rape, 53 cases of arson and murder, 2,842 cases of looting, and 16 cases of destruction, totaling 2,939 cases.

Even now, while the Provisional Senate is in session, such a bizarre thing has happened in Changchun. It can be said to be an embodiment of one of those statistics mentioned above.

A young couple, with deep affection for each other. One dark night last winter, a big-nosed soldier broke into their house. Without saying a word, he forcibly assaulted the woman before leaving. The young husband felt that this kind of "disaster" was irresistible and still treated his wife well. The wife originally wanted to die in anger, but seeing this, her love increased, and the two became even more "affectionate." Unfortunately, in October of this year, a child was suddenly born, and his physical features were unusual. After a doctor's examination, it was proven to be a thoroughbred mixed-race child. The young husband couldn't help but wonder if conception was possible after forced intercourse. The doctor replied that it was possible. But if this child is around, it will cause unpleasant feelings between the couple, and they are thinking of putting him to death. Friends advised: The little life itself is innocent, and there is no need to kill. If this child really evokes painful memories, then giving the child away to others is also an option.

Incidents like this are not uncommon, which can also explain one of the reasons why the people of Northeast China have unpleasant feelings towards certain people.

### Reviewing the Achievements of October

From "April 14th" this year, tracing back to December 22, 1945, the Changchun Municipal Government was engaged in taking over and promoting public administration under the occupation of the Soviet army. During this period, there are four things that can be said.

(1) Organize the Enemy and Puppet Industry Custody Committee. This organization was composed of local gentry and various agencies and organizations convened by the city government. They jointly took responsibility for the custody of enemy and puppet industries, compiled a list, so as to avoid losses, and prepared to hand them over to the people sent by the central government who were responsible for taking over.

(2) Organize the Property Adjustment Committee. This organization aims to take care of all enemy and puppet houses, so as to prevent them from being occupied by others. At the same time, it pays more attention to distributing some houses as civilian residences.

(3) Preventing corruption. At the beginning of the takeover, there were deep fears that unscrupulous officials would take the opportunity to engage in malpractice. As a result, one division chief and three takeover personnel were found to be derelict in their duties and were all punished.

(4) Reorganize the baojia system. At the beginning of the restoration, there was no way to talk about household registration and security. After the takeover, they started to handle it, with a total of more than 800,000 people. The situation at that time was quite effective.

From "May 23rd" to the present, the following points can be described:

(1) Sending back Japanese nationals and prisoners. Changchun has done a good job in handling this matter. The work of leaving behind Japanese nationals and prisoners in Northeast China began on May 17, while Changchun began after the National Army entered. Changchun has a total of more than 200,000 people left behind.

(2) Implementing baojia and police joint patrols. This is for the winter defense period, so that the people's strength can cooperate with the police to handle sentry duty, patrols, and household registration investigations. It is currently being actively promoted.

(3) Stabilizing commodity prices, wages, and rents. Regarding commodity prices, wages, and rents, price negotiation methods are adopted, and prices are jointly negotiated by various relevant groups, and then approved and implemented by the city government.

(4) Supporting cultural undertakings. In accordance with the central government's orders, citizens have extreme freedom of speech and publication. Therefore, there are quite a few newspapers and magazines published in Changchun.

(5) Appeasing young people. In the summer, they cooperated with the Forward Command Post of the Chief Executive's Office to run a summer training camp for young people, accommodating young people returning from the north of the Songhua River. It has also solved the employment problem for some of the trainees.

(6) Rectifying municipal finances. In accordance with the instructions of the Executive Yuan, streamlining administration and reducing staff, and delaying the handling of non-urgent needs. At the same time, the city's finances are working hard to develop resources and reduce expenditure.

(7) Improving public utilities and health undertakings. Improving tap water, especially paying attention to the cleanliness of drinking water. City trams and buses were completely destroyed in the war, but after active repairs, the number of vehicles operating in the city has greatly increased. The prevention of epidemics will not hesitate to use human and financial resources to handle.

(8) Strengthening education. Changchun not only seeks to increase the number of students, but also improves the quality of teachers, has held teacher training seminars for many times, and strengthens normal schools.

(9) Improving police administration. Changing the police's concept, cracking down on high-pressure work styles, improving service spirit, and cultivating patriotism. Especially in order to meet the requirement of Changchun's first priority for public security, all police facilities are mainly to cooperate with the military.

(10) Clearing real estate and land administration construction. In the past, real estate files were unfortunately destroyed in the "April 14th" fire, and now the takeover work is still not completed, and the ownership of enemy and puppet industries has not been determined, so a new Land Administration Bureau has been established, which will cooperate with the Finance Bureau in the future to be responsible for clearing and adjusting land administration and real estate.

The above are all the work achievements reported, and of course, there are also ongoing ones. However, from here, one can get a glimpse of the achievements of October.

### Looking Forward: Changchun Has Its Own Future

Changchun is currently in suffering. But precisely because of this, people see its "desolate" current situation. Inevitably, there are many feelings. In reality, Changchun has its own "future." Looking ahead, Changchun really has its beautiful future.

Changchun is located in the center of nine provinces, is an important town in Northeast China, is the capital of the puppet Manchuria, and is an important stronghold on the Sino-Soviet Railway connecting Europe and Asia. In a word, it is the first key artery on China's lifeline.

However, the serious fact at present is that the city's finances are insufficient. In such a magnificent city, it is desperately poor. If a fundamental solution to the financial resources is not considered, then the people of Changchun will not be able to maintain this city, nor will they be able to ensure that this city, built with the hard work of the people of Northeast China, will not change its old appearance for a long time. Not to mention reconstruction or anything else. Therefore, the senators of the Provisional Senate suggested that Changchun be changed to a secondary capital, Changchun be changed to a municipality directly under the central government, and that the Executive Yuan be stationed in Changchun, etc. Rather than looking at it from a positive perspective, saying that it is seeking to rebuild Changchun, it is better to look at it from a negative perspective, saying that it is seeking a solution to Changchun's financial resources. At the same time, it was also reported at the Provisional Senate: Although Shanghai and Tianjin are also municipalities directly under the central government, they are also cities with severe budget surpluses. Therefore, Changchun's request to be a municipality directly under the central government should be approved by the Executive Yuan.

### Officers and Soldiers of the 184th Division: Captured and Escaped

During the defense of Dashiqiao, a portion of the National Army's 184th Division was captured by the Communist Army. When Andong was recovered this time, the division, led by Regiment Commander Yang Chaolun, annihilated two battalions of traitorous bandits, broke through the encirclement, and returned to Shenyang. The citizens held a rally to express their welcome. (Northeast News Agency Photo)

### Penghu: The Key to Tainan

— Report on the 4th by He Minxian

Harbors and Bays Intertwined, Islands Stretching Across

The coastline of Penghu Island is winding and tortuous, with capes and headlands interlocking. The bay forms a peninsula, with an area of ​​four square miles, and the coastline is as long as five hundred miles. Facing Yuweng Island in the west, it forms a large bay, and the water depth can accommodate thousands of ships. However, crossing the current Taiwan Strait, the situation is extremely dangerous. Ships sailing on the sea must enter Penghu to take shelter in case of a storm, so as to avoid capsizing. The main ports are: Magong, Shili, Liangwen Port, Nanliao, Tudigongqian, Shasu, Zhenhai, Chikan, Tongliang, Da'ao Ye, Zhugao Bay, Jima Creek, Neian, Waianmen, Jiangjun'ao, Budai, Shui'an, etc. Of the eighteen, the east and west bays of Magong are the largest harbors, and the anchorage west of Xiangkou is 24 to 50 feet deep, with an area of 238,000 ping. Since ancient times, the islands of Penghu have been said to be 36 islands and 72 islets, or 49, or 55. In fact, according to precise surveys, there are only 64. Although the number of large and small islands and reefs included is said to reach more than 60, only 44 of them can be called islets. All can be divided into two groups: (A) Penghu Island Group (the collective name of Penghu Island, Baisha Island, Yuweng Island, and their affiliated islands, etc.). (B) Eight-Embrace Islands (the collective name of the Eight-Embrace Port, Jiangjunyu, Dongjiyu, Xijiyu, Dongyuping, Xiyuping, Dayu, Huayu, and their affiliated islands, etc.). Penghu Islands are the collective name of Penghu Island Group and Eight-Embrace Islands. This island (Dashan Island, namely Penghu Island) is in the center, the Eight-Embrace Islands in the south, Jibeiyu in the north, and Zhapo and Zhamu and other islands in the east. In the west, Yuweng Island (Xiyu) is sparsely and densely distributed, and they are layered one upon another, guarding the key point of the Taiwan Strait. Therefore, ships sailing nearby must use this island as the standard for their routes. However, the waves in the bay are turbulent, and the feet of the islands are densely covered with hidden reefs. It is not easy to moor for those who are not familiar with the waterways. The names of the islands are recorded as follows:

(A) There are 31 in the northern part of the island: (Baishayu, Nanmianguayu, Zhongdunyu, Jianyu, Junyu, Baishayu (two with the same name), Dacangyu, Yuanbeiyu, Jibeiyu, Woyu, Daxueyu, Yanqingyu, Jinyu, Maochangyu, Daoyu, Xiaoyu, Pingqiyu, Tudifengyu, Jilongyu, Baishayu (three with the same name), Caoyu (two with the same name), Xianjiaoyu, Niumujianyu, Hai'anzai, Baishadao, Tiezhenyu, Gupoyu, Maosiyu, Mudouyu, Quzhuayu, Beijiao.)

(B) There are 5 in the central part of the island: (Zhapoyu—Yangyu, Zhamuyu—Yinyu, Xiangjinyu, Dingdiaoyu, Jishanyu.)

(C) There are 20 in the southern part of the island: (Ba Zhaodao, Jinguazai, Jiangjunyao, Yuhou, Dizai, Toujin, Liyue, Ma'anshan Yu, Goushayu, Chuanfanyu, Dayu, Xiyuping, Dongyuping, Zhongzaiyu, Dongjiyu, Huayu, Xiaomaoyu, Damaoyu, Chutouyu, Caoyu (two with the same name).)

(D) There are 5 in the western part of the island: (Cetian Island—Xiao'anyu, Tongpanyu, Xiaomenyu, Hujingdao, Yuhua Wei Niao—Xiyu.)

Among the above islands, there are the most 31 in the northern part, and the least 5 each in the capital, western part. As for the area comparison, the area of ​​the main island is more than four square miles, and the combined area of ​​the 63 affiliated islands also reaches more than four square miles, which is similar to that of the main island, which is extremely coincidental. As for the origin of the island names, most of them are named after their shapes. The easternmost island is Zhamuyu, the westernmost is Huayu, the southernmost is Dayu, and the northernmost is Mudouyu.

### The Morality of Writing

— Chuantong Xian

Recently, this publication received a manuscript. It mentioned that a "Chemical Calculation Method" published by Kaiming in 1939 has recently been copied and published with a clever disguise. The analysis and comparison between the two are quite detailed, but unfortunately, due to space limitations, it could not be published. However, this made me think about the morality of writers. Writing is originally a very bitter thing. If someone makes a living by writing, it is already a dead end. If someone steals and exploits, it is simply too heartless.

This also makes me think of the lawsuit ten years ago between two bookstores because the English textbooks published by the two were similar. Some people say that Chinese people have a problem, that is, they don't know how to work hard to create. When they see that others have achieved a little success or made a little profit in a certain area, they rise up to follow, imitate, and counterfeit. For example, in Shanghai, no one knows which is the real one. What is strange is that this phenomenon can also occur in the publishing industry, which has a higher cultural level in China. Why can't we strive for progress and strive for improvement? We must find ways to eliminate this speculative psychology.

The Chinese publishing industry is extremely lacking in both material and spiritual aspects. This is undeniable. Therefore, on the one hand, we hope that people with capital will engage in the publishing industry, and the government will find ways to support them (such as issuing loans and exempting sales tax on publications). On the other hand, writers should enrich their own content, work hard in research, and maintain a noble personality. At the very least, we must maintain the minimum level of morality in writing.

### An Introduction to "Daily Chronicle of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom"—A Veritable History

— Luo Hongtao

Written by Guo Tingyi

Published by The Commercial Press

Over 1,400 pages

Price: 18,000 yuan

The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom's capital, Tianjing, fell to the Qing army on July 19, 1864 (corresponding to the 16th day of the sixth month of the third year of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty). More than eighty years have passed since its destruction, yet there is still no complete record of this great revolutionary movement. This is truly a great shame for historians. Now, the publication of Mr. Guo's book is sufficient to fill this major gap and is indeed a great boon to the academic community. It is observed that people's perspectives on the historical facts of the Taiping Rebellion can be divided into four periods. After its demise, both the Qing court above and the British and French imperialists from abroad jointly engaged in malicious counter-propaganda, vilifying the Taiping army to the point where they were considered worse than bandits and brigands. Simultaneously, the populace fabricated various imagined and brutal events. This constitutes the first period. Around the time of the founding of the Republic of China, the revolutionary atmosphere was already stirring, and people generally recognized the Taiping army as revolutionary martyrs. Consequently, various historical materials were fabricated (as Mr. Liu Yazi wrote on August 20th of the 23rd year of the Republic [1934], the original edition of Shi Dakai's poetry collection was edited by his deceased friend Gao Tianmei. Much of it was fabricated, mostly by Tianmei himself, as the purpose at the time was to promote revolution, using writing as a tool for propaganda. This can serve as a confirmation of this claim). Moreover, based on imagination, events that were seemingly true but actually false, such as Hong Xiuquan being a disciple of Zhu Jiuyu, Hong Daquan being named the Heavenly Virtue King, and Qian Jiang submitting memorials, were created. This constitutes the second period. In the ninth year of the Republic [1920], Liu Niu Chenruo copied and printed sixteen interesting documents related to the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom from the British Museum. Since then, an increasing number of people have been excavating historical materials related to the Taiping Rebellion from abroad. Mr. Cheng Yansheng from the library of the School of Oriental Languages in Paris; Mr. Xiao Yishan from the Oriental Department of the British Museum in London; Mr. Wang Zhongmin from the Cambridge University Library in England; and Mr. Yu Dawei from the Prussian State Library in Berlin, all made significant discoveries. (According to scholars, among the four mentioned above, Mr. Xiao's findings were the most abundant, and Mr. Yu's were the most refined. Mr. Yu's portion was proofread by Mr. Zhang Jusheng and compiled into my humble edition of "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Poetry and Prose Excerpts," which, regrettably, is now out of print.) The Palace Museum in China has also unveiled related original historical materials. These secrets, hidden for a century, are now re-emerging to the world, greatly aiding research. This constitutes the third period. However, although studying the historical facts of the Taiping Rebellion has become a trend among historians, the findings have been fragmented, and no one has been able to conduct a comprehensive study. This begins with Mr. Guo's book. In the preface, Mr. Luo Jialun stated that Mr. Guo spent over a decade silently working on this problem before achieving this great harvest. Mr. Guo himself, however, views his work modestly, considering his book a tool-like historical record, only seeking to prepare the groundwork for others, hoping that historians with talent and learning can benefit from this convenience and produce a complete record. This is said to be the fourth period. Frankly speaking, Mr. Guo's work is successful at the present time.

The book's chronology starts from the first year of the Jiaqing reign and ends in the seventh year of the Tongzhi reign. In addition to specifically recording the history of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom and the Nian Rebellion, it also attempts to describe the background of this great turmoil, such as the unrest during the Jiaqing and Daoguang reigns, popular uprisings in various regions, and the activities of the Tiandihui and the Triads, all within the scope of the record. The facts recorded consider all aspects, but limited by materials, military battle records constitute a large part. The recorded facts are arranged chronologically. The dates recorded include both the Chinese and Western calendars. Additionally, the new calendar implemented by the Taiping army, if verifiable, is also appended. The facts for each date are carefully verified. Those involving ambiguities are extensively researched and explained, truly worthy of being considered an excellent work. Simultaneously, the author believes that local gazetteers contain some important information not found elsewhere and therefore extensively utilizes them. This is a new path opened for those studying the history of the Taiping Rebellion. Although he was able to borrow reference books from Tsinghua, Central, Yenching, and Jinling Universities, as well as libraries such as the Central Political Library and the Peiping and Nanjing National Studies Libraries, giving him good advantages, his dedication to research is also admirable.

The main text of this book deserves praise, and the eight appendices attached are also worth introducing.

Appendix 1: Comparison of the Heavenly Calendar with the Lunar Calendar and a simplified table of days of the week. Several people have done this kind of work before Mr. Guo. However, the Heavenly Calendar's sexagenary cycle is not consistent with the lunar calendar's sexagenary cycle, differing by one day. Similarly, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom's day of the week does not correspond to the Western day of the week, also being one day earlier. Due to these two differences, previous works were completely abandoned. Mr. Guo's table, however, is worth using and guaranteed to be without error.

Appendix 2: Table of Figures of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. This is simply a small-scale biographical dictionary of the Taiping Rebellion. It begins with an explanation of ranks and titles, with detailed textual research. Each table is divided into ranks, names, birthplaces, experiences, birth and death dates, and annotations. The recorded events are rich, and the lookup is convenient, suitable for application.

Appendix 3: Table of Generals in Major Battles. Each battle records its commanders, subordinates, location, and opposing commanders. There are a total of eighteen tables on the Taiping army side and seven tables on the Qing side. These twenty-five tables could not have been written without having all the historical facts captured in one's mind. This is a truly rare effort.

Appendix 4: War Maps of the Hong and Qing Armies; a total of fourteen maps. "Left is the map, right is the history," as was valued in ancient times. With these maps, it will be even more interesting to study history. Mr. Luo Jialun also stated in his preface that the method of attaching maps is a modern concept. It would not have been possible without the progress of modern technology.

Appendix 5: Table of High Officials of the Qing Dynasty. Appendix 6: Table of Commanders in the Suppression of the Nian Rebellion. The two tables separately record positions, names, tenures, original positions, garrisons, and annotations, which helps with lookup. Appendix 7: Brief Biographies of Hong and Qing Generals. The collection is extensive, recording…

Appendix 8: Bibliography. The books recorded are limited to those that Mr. Guo has consulted and used as a basis for compilation. The books are divided into two parts: one is Chinese, with 197 titles, plus 380 local gazetteers, and 8 periodicals; the other is Western, with 43 titles. After each title, a brief explanation and commentary are added to clarify its nature. More than six hundred books were used. However, what the writer can say is that Mr. Guo's table is not intended to boast about his extensive collection. In reality, Mr. Guo did indeed quote each one individually. This is why it is so commendable.

Finally, it must be stated that Mr. Guo's book is an indispensable book for those studying the history of the Taiping Rebellion. Mr. Xiao Yishan is a leading authority on the history of the Qing Dynasty and has also contributed greatly to the study of the history of the Taiping Rebellion, possessing the most historical records related to the Taiping Rebellion. Mr. Guo's book should have been seen by him long ago. However, in recent correspondence, it was learned that he still regrets not having seen this book. Experts are still like this, let alone others. Therefore, without fear of being meddlesome, I am writing this article to introduce it.

### A Masterpiece of Human Geography: "The Geographical Basis of China"

— Junzhi

Authored by George B. Cressey, translated by Xue Yiyuan

Published by Kaiming Bookstore, September of the 35th year of the Republic [1946]

The relationship between geography and human life is the closest. It can be said that our understanding of the various human affairs in China depends on the study of geography, because only through it can we understand the factors of agriculture, resources, climate, regions, and human life.

Professor George B. Cressey, the author of this book, resided in China for a long time and completed this work after more than ten years of research and travel. At the same time, this work is precisely the result of his more than ten years of hard work. The author served in China as a visiting professor under the Cultural Affairs Bureau of the U.S. State Department, and as a representative in China for both the American Council of Learned Societies and the National Academy of Sciences of the United States. Due to these many conveniences, his research was even better than that of the people of our own country. Chinese geographers have never had the opportunity to conduct such long-term research, consuming so much funding. Therefore, although the author is an American, this book is still one of the more accomplished new geographical works in Chinese geography.

Today, this book is worth reading whether you are a geographer or not, just as the author states in his original preface: "China is now in the midst of unprecedented social, economic, and political adjustments. A great nation, traditionally isolated and conservative, is now rapidly renewing its life and becoming a member of the family of nations. Geography cannot claim to solve all the problems arising from this transformation, but it can shed light on some of the background of this evolution."

The Social Geographical Basis

This volume, "The Geographical Basis of China," is the general discussion part of George B. Cressey's geographical works on China, divided into six parts to separately explain: Geographical Landscapes, Topography, Climate, Farmers, Natural Resources, and World Relations.

Now, let's look at its contents: In the first chapter, "Geographical Landscapes," it points out that the most important factor in China's landscape is not soil, vegetation, or climate, but the people. This, we can believe. It is difficult to find a small piece of land on this ancient land of China that has not been rendered by human activity. At the same time, the author also points out China's natural isolation. In the past history, China was surrounded by obstacles, and had not been in contact with other parts of the world, so there was little exchange of knowledge. That is, the tropical jungle, the tall mountains, the vast deserts, and the vast oceans together maintained China's unity and isolation.

In "The Foundations of Social Environment," Thomas said: "It is now generally recognized that the most important factor in cultural progress is the contact of diverse cultures, while stagnation is caused by isolation. A certain environment is sufficient to touch another environment and provide a passage, to communicate with another area, which will encourage the susceptibility of people's minds and the progress of culture; conversely, an isolated environment will inevitably lead to psychological stagnation and repetition."

From this, we can understand the reasons for China's backwardness in science.

This chapter also describes contrasting places, charting the contrast between the South and the North, the pressure of population; and explaining the new and old transportation, listing tables of cars and highways in various places.

The author's concluding paragraph, "Understanding China," is inaccurate in several places because of the different era in which it was written. But as a reference, it is extremely valuable.

The Relationship between Climate and Farmland

In the second chapter, "Topography," it explains the geological foundation. China certainly does not have the glacial features of Europe and North America, but the author lists our characteristics. We cannot introduce them one by one here.

In addition, regarding mountains, rivers, alluvial plains, coastal seas, and changes in the Chinese territory, the author uses very sufficient materials to explain; and lists the population and area surveys of Chinese provinces for reference.

Climate—the factor that determines human activities—is discussed in Chapter 3 of this book. It describes the physics of China's climate, which is the monsoon operation that is sequentially transformed by topography and marine relations, the occasional tropical cyclone, and a series of continental storms that produce a climate zone. It also fully elaborates on the relationship between climate and life, and includes wind direction illustrations and tables of average temperature and average rainfall.

Chapter 4 is about "Farmers for Four Thousand Years." Of course, China is known as an agricultural country, and agricultural issues are the most important. In this chapter, the author first explains the morning landscape, and then returns to the foundation of agriculture, and the wide expression of cultivated land in China, lists and explains the cultivated land of the past dynasties and the cultivated land of various provinces, and also reports the detailed tables of cultivated land and crop area in various provinces. Crop yields are also explained in the table.

China's agricultural problems are still today. The author pointed out the general nature of the importance of China's agricultural problems in the past. China's fisheries can be science, and the transformation of society is needed. After the basic knots of the current situation are lifted, it can embark on this road.

The issue of natural resources is discussed in Chapter 5, which first discusses the historical background; the source of coal and the world's coal reserves, extending to the most important power—coal mining. Then, the storage estimates of coal and the coal production of each mine are listed and explained separately.

Other power sources, such as oil. The explanations of iron and other gold, non-gold, and non-metal types are also attached with tables; the chapter comes to explain China's mineral production and the prospects for China's industry.

Looking Forward to China's Trade

The last chapter is "China's Relations with the World." The author describes its historical background. China's furthest westward expedition and trade began only during the time of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty. By the 19th century, export trade gradually increased, and it lists and explains the goods directly exported to foreign countries, and the comparison of foreign trade commodities.

Of course, weaving trade is far beyond export trade. After the Opium War, international capitalism opened up China's independent and autonomous , and created the semi-colonial status mentioned by Sun Yat-sen. The author of this book also pointed out: "For many years, the value of tangible imports has greatly exceeded the value of exports. This so-called unfavorable trade balance has become increasingly harmful in recent years."

Finally, it explains China's trade and the foreign trade of various ports. So far, this book has come to an end.

After reading this book, we have a basic understanding of China's geography. Therefore, this book can be used as a basic understanding for young people in learning.

### Rereading "Fathers and Sons"

— Xinjun

Written by Turgenev, translated by Ba Jin

Published by Cultural Life Press, September of the 35th year of the Republic [1946], 365 pages

In the field of literature and art, French romantic literature, with its gorgeous writing, has attracted a wide range of readers. From this, we think of Turgenev, a famous writer. His novels and prose poems have intoxicated countless young people. Turgenev himself was Russian and of aristocratic descent. But he studied in France, so his works cannot escape the colors of French romanticism.

Most of Turgenev's works take the resistance of young people against the old forces during the Tsarist era in Soviet Russia as the theme. However, he only describes it from the side, using his refined writing and the "nihilistic" soul to depict those immortal figures in literature and art.

The novel "Fathers and Sons" depicts the conflict between new and old ideas in the era of the emancipation of serfs in Soviet Russia, and develops it through the prism of his view of life with his beautiful style.

The content of this novel is roughly:

A progressive landlord, a descendant of Russian aristocracy—Nikolai, and his son—Arkady, who returned home from the University of St. Petersburg, are the central figures. The author developed a magnificent masterpiece from the characters of the two.

Arkady is a mindless believer in nihilism, and it was his classmate Bazarov who gave him this confidence; this time he came home with Bazarov. Therefore, he criticized all of his father Nikolai's actions with his nihilistic eyes. And sometimes made his old father feel very unhappy.

Nikolai has an older brother, Pavel, who is a full-fledged maintainer of aristocratic dignity, a stubborn old man, so Bazarov often argues with him.

After a few days, the two like-minded nihilists met a beautiful Mrs. Anna at a welcome party; as a result, they unknowingly fell into the city of love, and all their actions in front of Anna seemed to be different from the past.

After the two nihilists walked into Anna's manor together, Bazarov gained victory. But Arkady was also very passionate about Anna's sister, Katya.

Soon, the two of them felt that it was not worth only going into the horns of love. So they broke away from the entanglement of love, and went to Bazarov's home to live together. Bazarov's father was a bright little serf. After they arrived there, the shackles of love did not break away from them; Arkady ran to Anna's manor on the pretext of Bazarov, then thought of Nikolai's "beloved concubine" Feni, and went to Nikolai's house, and got the chance to kiss Feni twice.

This secret was known by Nikolai's stubborn brother Pavel, and he was furious and agreed to duel with Bazarov. In the end of the duel, the stubborn old man was injured. Because of this lesson, the old man changed his previous stubbornness and compromised with the new trend.

Bazarov could no longer live in Nikolai's house; after he left, he ran to Anna and told Arkady about it, and also met Anna, and finally returned to his own father's farm.

Here, Nikolai, because of his changed brother's persuasion, broke the concept of class and formally held a wedding with Feni. Arkady also fell in love with Anna's sister and successfully married her father on the same day.

Fathers and sons combined two pairs of newlyweds on the same auspicious day; afterwards, the father and son jointly managed agriculture and did very well; the families were also very harmonious, and they lived a sweet life in that beautiful and happy environment.

What about Bazarov? After he returned home, he was engaged in the work of providing medical treatment to farmers, but, in a certain anatomy, he carelessly contracted a terrible disease and ended his life.

Bazarov's parents often confessed and wept in front of their son's coffin.

This masterpiece has reached its last page here.

After reading this work, it is very clear that it uses the ups and downs of love as a clue, fully expressing the atmosphere of romanticism and its non-reality. In the entanglements of love, various ideas are silenced.

Bazarov, originally a forward-thinking person, is encountering obstacles and suffering everywhere here. In the end, he destroyed himself.

Arkady, although he is an admirer of Bazarov, does not have the rebellious training of Bazarov; he was loved by his father and uncle, and as a result, he also became a follower of the cause.

What about Nikolai? His advanced thinking, cooperating with his son, entered a pink and happy family; his brother also reformed a stubborn aristocratic self-esteem and achieved a compromise.

This work has undeniable skills in its artistic quality in terms of literary description. The structure is also considered perfect. Only in terms of consciousness, as mentioned earlier, it cannot match the facts, and it is all in the manner of philistinism.

It uses a satirical pen to write about a forward-thinking youth destroying himself, while on the aristocratic side, the author has sympathy. Pavel's compromise and the sweet life of Nikolai's father and son are in contrast to Bazarov.

The writing of this work is very worthy of learning, because this work is a very good masterpiece to it as a constant artwork. The translator Ba Jin translated it based on the English version, and the translation is fairly fluent, but it may not be completely consistent with the original version. In short, this is a very beautiful artistic work!

### Concerning the Soviets

— Nine Chapters

A. WHITE: A REPORT ON THE RUSSIANS

The author of this book, Mr. White, visited the Soviet Union in the summer of 1944, when US-Soviet relations were extremely harmonious. He received "special permission" to "see what he wanted to see and write what he wanted to write after returning home." He visited the Malar industrial area in the heart of the Soviet Union, a place no foreigner had been to since the start of the 1926 Five-Year Plan. He entered the newly recovered rural areas of Ukraine, talking to farmers, hoping to hear their true innermost thoughts. Of course, there were one or two occasions when the iron fist of ideological control prevented Mr. White's freedom of access. They visited a factory in Siberia, where he had a very pleasant conversation with a German-speaking female worker. But as soon as White turned away, a secret policeman (NKVD, formerly GPU) spoke to her, and she became utterly submissive or silent. "In the Soviet Union, where can anyone freely talk to foreigners?" But, on the whole, Mr. White's group had a very free visit. In particular, he debated with a female translator in Moscow, frankly stating where he thought the Soviet Union was inferior to the United States; the frankness of this would probably surprise readers.

I am personally particularly interested in what life is like for ordinary Soviets. The author's viewpoint happens to be the same: he does not vaguely discuss Soviet policy, but often wants to know a worker's daily expenses. The standard of living of ordinary people is an achievement of governance and cannot be considered a military secret. Treating this kind of material as a military secret, thereby arousing suspicion, is always an unwise move.

In the third chapter, the author recounts his visit to three Moscow factories: an aircraft factory, an automobile factory, and a biscuit factory. In the first factory, he inquired about working hours and wages. Ordinary workers worked sixty-six hours a week and earned one thousand rubles. Eating one day in the factory cafeteria cost five rubles, which was very cheap. But what could you buy with the remaining eight hundred or more rubles per month? In the "store," ham cost over one thousand rubles a pound, and chicken cost around five hundred rubles a pound. Clothing was even more expensive. So this worker could fill his stomach by eating in the factory cafeteria and spend a few evenings watching plays in designated theaters, but "once he left the factory, his food and clothing immediately became a problem." He could not save money like an American. Mr. White said, "The factory is theoretically owned by the workers, but in reality, the workers belong to the factory."

In the second factory, Mr. White asked the "manager" what would happen if a worker was lazy at work. "First, there is a warning on the bulletin board, and then a speech at the trade union." Mr. White immediately understood! The trade union had become an organization for controlling the workers. On another occasion (Chapter 8), White asked a trade union leader if a worker could go elsewhere if he was dissatisfied with his current job. The answer was "He must apply to the factory." "If he leaves without asking permission, can he find work elsewhere?" The answer was "No, he will have a hard time finding work anywhere in the Soviet Union." Mr. White even asked: "Isn't this equivalent to a blacklist?" The answer was "It can't be considered a blacklist." The American concept of "freedom" cannot be found in the Soviet dictionary. As for the author comparing the lives of Soviet workers to those of American prisoners in the fourth chapter, it may be a bit too indignant. Similarly, "the treatment of workers throughout the Soviet Union is not much different, because all factories belong to the government, and all treatment is stipulated by the government." Some Chinese readers may agree with this approach, but most Americans are not accustomed to it.

"In the Soviet Union, the lives of employed workers are not as good as the lives of workers receiving unemployment benefits during the American economic depression." It is hard to say how reliable this statement is. But even the words of that Soviet female translator in the book can only be considered "comforting oneself." She said? "I myself am suffering, but I know that everyone else is suffering, so I am comforted." People with common sense all know that the banner of socialism is to realize "everyone's paradise," not everyone being equally poor. There will always be a gap between the banner and what is actually done. An ideal will always change somewhat when it is put into practice. This was true before and after the French Revolution, and it is no different with the Russian Revolution.

The writer has not studied the economic systems of the United States and the Soviet Union and can only briefly discuss what Mr. White believes are the shortcomings of the Soviet Union. (1) It is very difficult for the Soviet government to plan and guide the activities and development of factories throughout the country from one center (the Kremlin). The "managers" or people in charge of each factory tend to become complacent, lack initiative, and some technical and managerial talents are sometimes purged due to political lines. (2) The elimination of the profit motive reduces the desire to compete, and people generally do not want to improve production methods. According to Mr. White, the American system is more stimulating to new inventions than the Soviet system. The Stakhanovite movement was actually a covert restoration of competition, but the encouragement of "medals" is not as good as practical benefits. "Generally speaking, capitalism invents, and socialism imitates." This is White's view.

However, what is read in the book, that is, what the author saw, is that the Soviet Union also has many advantages. For example, the standard of living in the Soviet Union is lower than in the United States, but there are no beggars. During wartime, supplies are always prioritized for frontline soldiers. And the Soviet government is good at dealing with issues between ethnic minorities, etc. The author has never denied this.

Books like "impressions" or "memoirs" have become an important genre in English books. The writing is fluent, like a novel; the observations are insightful, sufficient for experts to extract. This book is also like this. But our post-war publishing industry rarely sees this type of book for the time being.

### Publishing News

Spring and Autumn

### Introducing [Meng Jiangnü]

— Wang Bosheng

As early as twenty-one years ago, I was engaged in the research and improvement of inherent and modern drama art in Beiping. I happened to see the premiere of Mr. Afuxialomov's opera in the Zhenguang Cinema. Twelve years ago, at the Shandong Provincial Drama Academy, I was involved in the pilot performance of the opera Yue Fei. Not long ago, at the National Opera School, together with Zheng Zhisheng, Lin Gangbai, Chen Tianhe, Zhu Chongzhi, and many friends in the music and dance world, I also participated in the experimental performance of the operas Jing Ke, Zheng Chenggong, and Going to the Country. Today, Afuxialomov and Mr. Chen Zhong's Meng Jiangnü has also been performed in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places. Some of the performers this time are former colleagues and classmates, who all told me that this time the approach is the same as our previous experiments in terms of the application of theory and techniques. Therefore, I watched it twice and made a serious introduction and explanation of its constituent principles and its influence on political philosophy and artistic philosophy.

One

Why introduce this type of art? From the perspective of political philosophy, since the Three Dynasties in China, due to the influence of feudal thought, the realm of national thought has gradually had invisible constraints, and society has therefore become increasingly rational. In the vast society, a certain attitude and belief have been created in the psychology of the people, so the culture itself has entered a stage of stagnation for two thousand years. This invisibly pathological society has felt the oppression of the international community in various economic aspects in the past century. Later, it became poor due to rationality, so it naturally formed selfishness and infighting, causing the society to fall into a state of collapse, fragmentation, and disunity. This is one of the reasons why Mr. Sun Yat-sen engaged in revolutionary work. After the revolution, followed by the arduous war of resistance, it has also achieved its full success. In terms of political and various improvements before and after the war, all staff who understand the overall situation have done their best under the daily supervision of the leader, but they still cannot save the decline of society in case of emergencies. The problem must have other causes.

As far as I can see, the way to revival in the future is science and art. The importance of science is well known, and the importance of art is more important than science, but it is not easy for the general public to understand. For example, in terms of industrial products of natural science, the more real the natural laws found in the universe, the greater the power and the more contribution to mankind. However, no matter whether it is an atomic bomb or an airplane, its performance power is ultimately limited. After all, it is mankind that manipulates the universe and shakes the universe, because mankind has a subtle soul. Therefore, the ancients governed the country and paid attention to the spiritual life of mankind, as well as the ears, eyes, mouth, and nose of the human body, the so-called residence of the soul, in terms of clothing, food, housing, and transportation. (Rites) served as the basis for its political measures, so its political philosophy was that rites regulated the people's hearts, music harmonized the people's voices, politics was used to implement them, and punishment was used to prevent them. Rites, music, punishment, and politics reached everywhere without conflict, then the royal way was fully prepared. From this, we know that punishment and politics are inevitable measures, and rites and music are essential elements of life. (Rites are nourishment, and should be seen as the rhythm of time and space art. In terms of human affairs, it is only the measure between people. Please refer to Sima Qian's discussion on rites and music in the Records of the Grand Historian)

Natural science has reached such a complex stage, so the art of cultivating people's hearts must also progress in parallel with the functions of natural science in order to produce a balanced effect. For example, ancient sedan chairs were so good, but no one rides them anymore, because their functions are too far from those of airplanes and trains. Therefore, some of the functions of ancient rites and music should be replaced by musical drama, because music must enter drama to prick people's hearts and respond to people's rhythms. We really cannot think that it is just a kind of decoration for life because there is a drama character, because opera is a powerful organism. The use of lines and colors is the creation of visual science in human spirit, and rhythm and melody are the creation of auditory science in human soul. All progressive arts are sciences that cultivate the soul. Only with good cultivation of the soul can heat occur between people, can people's minds be broadened, can there be elasticity and compassion, and can the society be activated and have new vitality. Therefore, any country with scientific development in Europe and the United States must also be a country with artistic development, because science has a foundation for social peace and governance, and society cannot expect peace and governance without spiritual alignment. There is mutual effect. This is one of the reasons why this kind of art career should be valued.

Two

From the perspective of the philosophy of contemporary art. Chinese society has fallen into a stage of rational poverty. If art is engaged in provocation or hints of divergence, it is the masses who will be directly harmed. In view of the historical facts of the feudal society that gave us too much rationalization, it seems that we cannot but ask for something in the creation of emotional art, because society cannot be improved by blindly destroying it, nor can it be effective by blindly whipping it.

The following I will say a few words from the point of view of creation, because this is necessary for the analysis of the Meng Jiangnü drama. All kinds of great art, he himself is a kind of beautiful realm, with an inviolable style, with this style, and then can regulate people, a kind of beautiful realm, must have his constituent factors, in music, because there is rhythm so can transcend reality, because transcend reality so people can forget its ugliness, and a kind of beautiful realm and great style, in opera, its success, often does not belong to the success of a kind of expression medium, because it must be the balanced development of various expression media, in order to produce a spiritual and fleshly harmonious organic organization. But sometimes, there are exceptions. If a certain expressive medium has its unique beauty, it can gradually induce other expressive media to cooperate with it, and gradually form a complete organization. For example, the human soul is a congenital endowment, and its clothing and action are dominated by the soul. Although a kind of embellishment sometimes makes people difficult to distinguish between true and false, so how an opera artist grasps the method of opening up and completing things is indeed not an easy thing. The most commendable part of Meng Jiangnü's music and dance is that it has a considerable foundation for the application of this kind of coordination.

What is the independent style of Chinese music? This is the first question to be studied. China is a society of ethics and morality, so in music, it does not create emotions with music, but uses medicine to create its ethical style, which is based on the composition of ethics and morality, so all the arts of its society also have their independent physical states with something to rely on, so there is a head, abdomen, and tail, mostly transcending reality, peace, and the expression of personality. Its value is more focused on personality than on emotions. That is, the bell is used to establish martial arts, the bamboo is used to establish meetings, the drum is used to establish movement, and the chime is used to establish辩. The reason why we cherish our percussion instruments is only for this reason. In terms of the era, the poverty of Chinese music has been swallowed up by the torrent of its era. Mr. Afuxialomov picked up things that had been forgotten for a long time, and gave him rich emotions and the power of the era, making a kind of Chinese unique language (music is the language of the world) become the language of the world, which is indeed a thing worth cherishing. If the chapter of Meng Jiangnü's music can further strengthen the creation of its main melody, so that its character is more powerful, or more extraordinarily distinct.

Regarding the movement, I believe that in the eyes of the artist, there is no distinction between new and old, good or bad for all his expressive media, because everything new mostly comes from the changes of the old. What the artist needs to consider carefully is the balance of power, the harmony of color, the distance of scale, and the speed of rhythm. In terms of movement, rhythm and lines are his expressive media of force. This kind of rhythm can achieve consistent harmony with music, installation, drama, and other related aspects, and it must be successful. Chinese inherent drama has many similarities with Indian drama. The main thing is movement. Two years ago, Zhongnong exchanged opinions with Mr. Gang Ge Li. He deeply praised the place where Chinese drama uses movement to represent words. I think that in drama, there is a need to make further development on the basis of what has already been achieved, because in the arts, it is still a new enlightenment. In the previous performance of Yue Fei, the expression of coordination and incoordination in movement was made, and the harmonic development with the harmony of music, its function sometimes exceeded music, because movement is after all much more distinct than music. The one who actually carried out the directing task of Meng Jiangnü was Mr. Chen Zhong, who had put in a lot of effort, which can be seen. I still hope that they will work harder to make the guests and hosts distinct, have climaxes, be able to increase the changes in patterns, and use movement and stillness more appropriately, so as to strengthen the creation of its character, then for the new harmonious introduction of inherent art, a pattern of independent creation can be established on the modern drama stage.

In terms of installation, its style is generally quite harmonious, but the center of gravity of each painting should still be strengthened, so that all sublimation effects transcend reality and have a basis.

In terms of clothing, it is also quite gorgeous, and no major problems can be seen. If you can not stick to historical facts, and increase the expression of character or make it more vivid on the basis of historical facts in lines and colors.

In terms of the drama text, the dialogue of the whole drama should be changed to poetry, and its sentence breaks do not have to follow the inherent yin and yang flat and oblique tones (as in the old drama), but should be created in terms of light and heavy speaking, and on the basis of emotion. As for the structure of the whole drama, the climax of each act, and the climax of the whole drama, should be strengthened to make it a three-dimensional style to accommodate all the techniques.

I think everything is easy to change now that she has established a commendable pattern, because these are all trivial issues.

From the perspective of political necessity and artistic philosophy, it cannot be said that the performance of Meng Jiangnü is the most cherished work, because under the same principle, our ancient great epics, and all cultural and artistic traces, can be used to have further opportunities to express to people at home and abroad. Although this kind of creation is not impossible for us to grasp ourselves, the examination of musical art is after all a task of genius, and requires a long time to work hard. Afuxialomov has been in China for thirty years. He is welcome to work for the cause of art. Handel was a German who lived in England and became famous. His Messiah oratorio was passed down as a beautiful story in the world because it was revered by the King of England. Chopin was a Pole who also lived in France and became famous, because art is a common property of mankind. As for the plot of the drama, it can be seen that Qin Shihuang is selfish and self-interested, disregarding the hunger and suffering of the people, and only trying to achieve the desire of one family to achieve a foundation for all generations, and making this brutal and unjust act against the public, destroying everything of the people, and building the Great Wall for the sacrifice of one person and one surname, then Wan Xiliang and Meng Jiangnü are only one representative of the whole people. Those who suffer from it are all like this in every family. If we face reality squarely, then after this great war, when people all over the world are suffering, all countries are suffering from expanding their military strength again with all their strength, then this drama cannot be said to be a most meaningful contribution to saving peace and saving the world, because its most cherished place is to regulate people with the style of art.

### Goethe's Quotations

— Stubborn Stone

Nature is eternally true and serious; it is never wrong. The incompetent cannot see nature, but those who are learned, pursue truth, and are pure in heart can see the mysteries of nature. Nature is constantly in progress, and it curses all lazy behavior.

Error is easier to see than truth, because error is on the outside. So it is easy to see, while truth is underneath, and most people are unwilling to look for it.

### Nude Woman

— Dai拉克窪

Dai拉克窪 (E. Deracroin 1798-1864) was a traitor among the students of David, an early French classicalist writer. He not only did not inherit his teacher, but also established a new banner and established the Romantic school, causing a great revolution in the art world, and enlightening later generations to establish painting theory. The style is novel, the colors are complex, and the subject matter is mostly legends, myths, and history. "Dante's Boat" is one of his representative works. This nude woman was modeled after a maid in the court at that time. The brushwork is concise and solid (lion).

### Fiddler

— Li Jinming

Yandong Hutong is in the western city of Beiping, and even the most detailed map does not contain its name. A secluded neighborhood, except for a few jujube trees bent at the corners of the walls, in the summer, only the rhythmic copper percussion of the water fruit peddlers is heard. On winter nights, the Muezzin chants in a long voice: "Allah Yang Yue..."

At the western end of the hutong is the city wall. The mule cart road is always so gray, deep and thick. Crows gather in flocks on the telephone wires and in the weeds on the city wall. Only the fish-white sky is a suitable view under the line of sight.

Especially in the autumn, I change with this environment. I often carry a lacquered cane that is convenient for use as a weapon for self-defense, and stroll to the vicinity of the city wall for sightseeing. I am very strange that I don't know what motive I have for taking a sightseeing interest in this gray scenery.

One day after the Mid-Autumn Festival, I followed the old road and walked to the bottom of the city wall, intending to go a little further north to find the stone steps that could go up the city for sightseeing. I met a short, fat man wearing a blue cloth gown. His head, like a steamed bun, was shaved very cleanly. He held a few pieces of tofu held in a lotus leaf in his right hand, and carried a bottle of sesame oil in his left hand. He smiled at me and said:

"Sixth Lord, you are really funny, why are you wandering around here?"

I looked at him for a long time.

"You forgot me," he made a grand gesture, choked by phlegm, and said. "Haven't you heard what Qu Ziqiu plays, how much! I live diagonally opposite your master's house."

Oh, yes, his surname is Qi, a fiddler. Every evening, the secluded erhu sound from the opposite courtyard came to my ears from his hands. Due to the inspiration born of art, I could not help but change my stubborn state, with some nostalgic expression, and said:

"It's you! How could I not know. Your craftsmanship, not only now, I have experienced a lot since I was a child. How are you doing now?"

"Alas, don't mention it. Now, now, now there is nothing."

"Nothing? Aren't you playing the erhu in the theater anymore?"

"I haven't done this job for two years."

Old Qi's eyes were a little cloudy, like a cloud of sorrow obscuring his mood. Indeed, I have also heard people say that this year, he has only been invited by a few amateur performers in a cold place - Bin Yan Hua Lou. His former glory has disappeared to where he knows. He has become the violin player of those "three people (Trio)" on the road, and sometimes it is difficult to find a partner. Is it because he is old? Or for some other reason, he lost the favor of the old men?

"I can't join the band, Sixth Lord. They are new, - they say they are new, and they regard us as old. The old Min also loves the new, composes new tunes, goes to Harbin, runs to Hong Kong, and Shanghai. I'm left with this unchanged, unmoved one. One is reluctant to part with the cheap coal noodles in Beiping, and the other is because I have an old mother at home. I'm just so frustrated, isn't it my fault?"

"You are too modest, you can start a class and recruit students."

"That's not true! It's easy to say, but it's not easy to say..."

Old Qi seemed to suddenly have an unpleasant thought, holding the tofu, and walked past me. After a few steps, he finished by saying:

"See you tomorrow!"

This time I left Beiping was in 1933, to find a few friends to do a small thing. Who knew that four years later, I still returned to the secluded old residence. I still live in the front courtyard - the room with two jujube trees next to the window. I started doing an editing job - according to the original text of Fan Ben, I extracted the general meaning of the main critical trends of modern times and wrote it into a booklet.

I hope to restore the inspiration of my early years in that light corner, writing prose poetry. But I can no longer hear that elegant erhu sound. This erhu sound, which used to make me nostalgic, fantasize, and sleepless, has now become silent, and I can't help but guess - ah, Old Qi, you are silent... You didn't abandon art, or did he move?

The servant Old Tian told me when I asked him once:

"Old Qi is in jail, and he hasn't come out yet. The year before last, he opened a small grocery store and lost hundreds of dollars. He went back to his hometown to sell land, and got into a lawsuit. He lost the lawsuit, so he was... Alas, what a pity, that good Xipi!"

Writer Anecdotes

### Voltaire

— Gan Si

In 1717, when the great French writer Voltaire arrived in England, he discovered that the English people were extremely resentful of the French. Walking the streets of London was a dangerous matter for his life. One day, while he was strolling, a group of angry Englishmen shouted, "Kill him, hang this Frenchman!"

Voltaire stood firm and, facing them, said loudly, "Gentlemen of England! You want to kill me because I am a Frenchman! But am I not already severely punished by my misfortune of not being English?"

The crowd couldn't help but cheer and escorted Voltaire safely to his own residence.

### An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood 120

— Ye Jingfeng

Why did Tsurumi come to Matsushima? Obviously, he knew his plan had failed. He thought he could use the Black Dragon Society, on one hand, to passively reduce the obstructing forces, and on the other hand, perhaps actively obtain more accurate news that could be used to uncover the secret of the "Seven Sealed Letters." Who knew that the Black Dragon Society would give him Pingzi instead, a formidable opponent; moreover, judging from the past dozen hours, he seemed to be still a love-stricken devil, a kind of entanglement hard to break free from.

From the Konoe residence, he realized that Konoe, this glory-hungry, bloodthirsty demon, was not as easy to deal with as he had imagined. In addition, he originally knew that the Fifth Column was quite formidable, but he never dreamed that there would be such alert and agile figures among them. And that elder Aoki was simply an incredible magician, able to grasp metaphysical power and manipulate people's minds. He still didn't know their views on this war of aggression, but if they happened to advocate annexing the entire Asia and becoming world hegemon, thinking like those demons, then their magic group would also be a great obstacle. In other words, Tsurumi wanted to reveal the "secret machinery" by himself and the power of a few comrades, which was tantamount to climbing a tree to catch a fish.

Moreover, listening to Pingzi's tone, there were many factions in Tokyo's political, governmental, military, and business circles, each with considerable power, and they even made a big fuss about his little involvement with the Black Dragon Society. This meant that his plan, before even starting, was already seen as destined to fail. Furthermore, the physical exhaustion of these past two days was also a major factor pushing him into despair. So, he temporarily put everything aside and ran to Matsushima in a puff of smoke. Madam Koyuan and Kikuko possessed a mixed warmth and understanding of mother, lover, and confidante, and the quiet and elegant location and residence were enough to dispel the adverse mood in his heart.

He sat for a while, daydreamed for a while, felt hungry, and put on his slippers to go downstairs. Kikuko was the first to notice Tsurumi coming downstairs, as if she had been waiting at the bottom of the stairs. She first gave Tsurumi a casual greeting, asking if he had slept well, and then, in her sweet and crisp voice, shouted towards the half-open dining room door, "Mom, Yu-ge is coming downstairs." Madam Koyuan also responded from the kitchen, "Kiku-er, quickly open the door to the Buddha hall." Soon, the old lady, who was over sixty but did not appear old, came out of the kitchen with a kind smile on her face.

Kikuko took the lead in opening the door to the Buddha hall, stepping aside to let Tsurumi and her mother enter. This was a small room with four tatami mats, already lit with oil lamps and sesame orchid incense. In the center of the small shrine was a Buddha statue, and below it on the offering table were several framed enlarged photos, one of which was a photo of Koyuan Keikazu, Kikuko's father, taken during his lifetime; and another was a photo of Meizi, Tsurumi's adoptive mother.

Madam Koyuan and Kikuko accompanied Tsurumi in the Buddha hall to pay respects and pray for blessings, and then they walked together to the living room, where everyone met again, exchanged greetings and inquiries, without any nagging or trivialities. At this time, Kikuko showed her housekeeping skills, first serving Tsurumi to sit down, and then instructing the maid to serve dishes and heat wine. This place was filled with warmth: Madam Koyuan sat near the window, watching Tsurumi drink with a smile, saying politely without making people feel embarrassed, "I seemed to have a premonition, so I didn't go to the market today, and I unintentionally bought these snacks, including the small dried fish you usually like, I don't know if your taste has changed..."

Kikuko poured wine cup after cup, occasionally interjecting a few elegant jokes, "Yu-ge's taste won't change much; look, his first chopstick is for fish slices, the second chopstick is also for fish slices, and the third chopstick is still for fish slices."

### To Dr. Mei Lanfang

— Zhao Chengbo

Four Seven-Character Quatrains with Preface

Dr. Mei Lanfang is fond of books and music, skilled in singing and dancing, and is the leading figure in the Peking Opera world of our time. During the war, he was trapped in enemy territory and sought to escape without success. He grew a mustache and refused to perform; his actions were not far from those who destroyed their appearance and swallowed charcoal to pledge their lives to the country. Is he perhaps a descendant of Lei Haiqing, a Tang musician? After the victory, he opened in Shanghai and performed "Fei Gongren Assassinating the Tiger." Tickets cost tens of thousands of taels of gold, and people rubbed shoulders as if flocking to a market. With both the drama and the person perfect, it is fitting that he attracts so many people! Mirroring Zhang Sheng's love, he defends the chastity of a loyal woman; with an empty flute case, he further shows his determination to care for his homeland. I have written four seven-character quatrains to praise him.

It is when the soldiers break through the enemy's sky,
That the memories of lantern-lit "Rainbow Skirt Dance" arise;
The Peking Opera world has its own sorrowful matters,
Mei's grub has been suffering for ten years.

Ghost fires light up autumn tombs with ten thousand mounds of earth,
The rise and fall of dynasties are like dreams, the waters flow endlessly;
Do not say that no one grows old in the war-torn world,
Dr. Mei today also has white hair.

With red powder and green robe, he shows patriotism,
With a dove-like figure and crane-like face, he is ashamed to steal life;
Now that the talented one has died and Turtle Longevity has aged,
Who else recognizes his name?

Ten years of loneliness, deserted opera houses,
Today, laughter and cheerful words fill the decorated building;
I beg my old man not to age too quickly,
Central Plains is still the land of Han.

### Lament for the Slum Dwellers

— Shaofu

Policies must be carried out, and we wholeheartedly support them. The authorities have a pragmatic spirit and wise plans, want to do things, and are willing to do things, and we also admire them very much; and we can even better understand and are willing to offer sympathy and support for all the difficulties and obstacles encountered during the implementation of policies. However, regarding the matter of demolishing slum dwellings, we would like to suggest that it be carried out after getting through this severe winter, in the coming spring, that is, implemented two months later. I wonder if this humble opinion can be heard?

For the safety of four million people, sacrificing forty thousand slum dwellers, even if it is not to such a precise extent, the urban construction has its own overall plan, not to mention that these forty thousand slum dwellers are by no means sacrifices, but are only being asked to move to non-restricted construction areas. Therefore, in principle, we absolutely support it without any doubt.

Why do we want to request a two-month delay in implementation on behalf of them? It is really a matter of humanity. This year, all industries have felt the economic recession, and the lower and middle classes, in particular, feel the economic pressure. Coupled with the extreme cold, the end of the year, demolishing and building, and carrying out large-scale construction will not only increase the financial burden but also make people feel embarrassed in terms of manpower. If you and I were one of these forty thousand households, in these urgent and declining times, what kind of sad shadow would be cast on our mood!

Human touch! We should be able to consider it a little!

Naturally, we are well aware of the authorities' careful handling of this matter, and we also know that the slum dwellers will be able to obey the law and follow the instructions, and there will definitely be no problems. Perhaps we are being a little too emotional, but wouldn't it be more considerate if these slum dwellers could barely manage to get through this severe winter?

It is the kindness of a woman!

### Ten Years Ago Today in Tokyo

— Xiaomai

…Remembering an important day in history…

Ten years ago today, Chairman Chiang suffered the Xi'an Incident. It took thirteen days for him to escape danger and return to Nanjing. Before leaving Shaanxi, Chairman Chiang addressed Zhang and Yang, saying, "This decision of the Xi'an Incident is related to the survival of China's fifty-year history and is also a critical turning point for the survival of the Republic of China." The history of the past ten years has proved that these two "prophetic" remarks were not exaggerated.

When the "Double Twelfth" Incident occurred, the writer was staying in Tokyo. The situation at the time is still vaguely remembered.

According to historical records, the "Double Twelfth Incident" occurred at 5 a.m. before dawn on that day. That morning, the Xi'an Telegraph Bureau had been monitored by the defense forces, so the news could not be transmitted. The first extra edition in Tokyo, I remember, was published before the usual evening paper, which seemed to have been sent from Nanjing. As far as I knew afterward, many of the telegrams from the newspapers at that time and later were censored and deleted by the Japanese authorities, so what was left was too short to be further shortened. After the evening paper at about 5 p.m., there was also an extra edition of a certain newspaper.

Enemies rejoice

From then until "December 25," when Chiang escaped danger and returned to Nanjing, the correspondents of the major Tokyo newspapers in China were ordered by their headquarters to compete in reporting. Even the city's on-site reporters desperately interviewed the external repercussions. At that time, the Chinese Embassy in Japan in Azabu District and Ambassador Xu Shiying were naturally the first targets, but Xu kept his mouth shut, and the reporters gained nothing. As I learned afterward, the information successively received by Japan's "Kasumigaseki" (Ministry of Foreign Affairs) and "Miyakezaka" (Ministry of the Army) in Tokyo was comparable to that of the embassy!

When the city's on-site reporters had nothing to write and nothing to record, the "Yomiuri Shimbun," which had risen suddenly in Tokyo and was competing with the two major hegemons, "Asahi" and "Mainichi," actually interviewed the dormitories of students studying in Japan. One student studying in Tokyo replied, "We know as much as what is recorded in the newspapers." This sentence (which was a bit like "diplomatic rhetoric" but was indeed the truth) was unexpectedly published on the front page of the city news section and was accompanied by several photos.

From the night of the twelfth, I clearly remember that Tokyo's teahouses, small restaurants, and bathhouses all used this as a topic and as the center of their chats.

The main figures of the Japanese military and government were naturally very "concerned" about the situation at the time. On the night of the thirteenth, I accidentally took a "metered car" for business and passed near the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs! I saw that their lights were still brightly lit, which was different from usual. It was not until I read the newspaper on the morning of the fourth that I realized that the main figures of the Japanese parties had held a long meeting there for four or five hours that evening to discuss the so-called "countermeasures," the primary goal of which was still the same: "to see if they could fish in troubled waters and take advantage of the situation."

The next day, the heads of the Japanese army and navy held a joint meeting and decided on the following two so-called "principles": (1) Take self-defense measures when necessary; (2) Maintain vigilance and observe quietly. Isn't this a "fishing" measure? The foreign minister at the time was Arita, the army minister was Terauchi, and the navy minister was Nagano.

After the incident, the first official contact between Ambassador Xu and the Japanese authorities was the day after Chiang Ting-wen returned to Luoyang from Shaanxi on the eighteenth. This conversation lasted more than fifty minutes. At that time, Foreign Minister Arita shamelessly requested: "I hope to obtain some special news about the Xi'an Incident in a private capacity."

The Japanese ambassador to China at the time was Kawagoe, but on December 5, he had already left Beijing and resided in Shanghai because the Sino-Japanese negotiations had come to an end. It was not until the nineteenth that he returned to Beijing from Shanghai upon the "Ministry of Foreign Affairs" instruction. However, whether Kawagoe was in Beijing or Shanghai, Tokyo's information during these thirteen days was equally rapid and detailed.

Interestingly, Toihara, the head of the intelligence division, expressed his views frankly: "Japan really should quickly re-examine China."

Disappointed

Despite the beautiful diplomatic rhetoric and the slippery newspaper editorials, the fact that the Japanese warlords at the time wanted to take advantage of the situation, no matter how big or small, is undeniable. I still remember that after the "Double Twelfth" Incident, the Tokyo stock market, cotton cloth trade, and rayon price plummeted, which proves what the Japanese were imagining in their hearts. Wasn't this trying to expand the conflict and cause a major war on the "wishful thinking" calculation?

On the evening of December 25, the Tokyo newspapers also issued extra editions, and many of them included photos of Chiang. That night was originally a night of Christmas celebrations, but on that night, many financial and military magnates were greatly disappointed. Because: What they hoped for had vanished. Only a few people in the stock market gained something.

Many students studying abroad did indeed party wildly that night, and some almost stayed up all night. But it is doubtful whether they were celebrating anything. On that night, how many people knew that the Sino-Japanese War, which would begin seven months later, had already planted the gunpowder fuse and the seeds of victory nine years later?

### Learn from Children!

### 12 and 13

— Momo

Some people believe that "thirteen" is the most unlucky number because Jesus' Last Supper had exactly thirteen people at the table, including Judas, who killed Jesus.

Therefore, some people say: the reason why the "Xi'an Incident" was resolved peacefully that year was that the incident occurred on the "twelfth" rather than the "thirteenth."

But he forgot that the number of days from the occurrence of the incident to the rescue and Chiang's escape was exactly thirteen days, from the twelfth to the twenty-fifth!

Some people also say: on the evening of the eleventh, Shao Yuanchong, Yang Hucheng, Chen Cheng... and other gentlemen ate at a table with thirteen people in Xi'an. Therefore, Shao was killed at dawn on the twelfth.

And Zhang Xueliang "Young Marshal" did not attend the banquet that night. Wasn't he later granted a special pardon?

Shao Yuanchong stayed in room 113 of the "Xijing Guest House" in Xi'an that night. The place of martyrdom was also "thirteen"!

Only Mr. Endner flew to Shaanxi on the thirteenth to mediate, and this "thirteen" was a good omen.

And today, that "guest house" has changed this room stained with historical bloodstains to room 130.

But the Arabic numeral code is still "thirteen," but after "thirteen," there is a "zero," indicating that the evil spirit has been eliminated!

[12], An eventful day

In terms of months, May is the month with the most anniversaries of the year. But in terms of day order, the "twelfth day" of each month seems to be an "eventful day."

Today, the twelfth, is an example. Ten years ago today, on the twelfth, someone caused chaos and almost caused a major disaster.

According to the author's knowledge, the following months also have festivals on the twelfth day:

February 12th, Commemoration of North-South Unification. March 12th, Anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's Death.

April 12th, Anniversary of the Purge of the Kuomintang in 1924.

November 12th, Anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's Birth.

December 12th, Anniversary of the Xi'an Incident.

Also, President Chiang escaped from Xi'an and returned to Nanjing on December 25th. This day is both the Anniversary of the Yunnan Uprising and the world-renowned "Christmas." (Ink)

### Women First?

— Chen Zhong

Our country has always valued men over women. Generally, parents regard their daughters as "other people's" people, and once they are married, they are no longer recognized as their own. Although we can exceptionally see records of valuing women in old books, they are, after all, exceptions. It is gratifying that in recent years, with the rise of the theory of equal rights for men and women, society has begun to look at women with new eyes and regard them differently. Especially in cities, women are the most glamorous. Snobbish parents value daughters even more, as daughters are their money-making trees, and sons are the ones who are unpromising!

In Shanghai's "upper class" society, where Chinese and foreigners mix, we often hear the slogan "Women First"—Ladies First—which is even translated into both Chinese and English. Is it an international saying? Therefore, many people believe in it: smoking must be permitted by women, men must take off their hats when they see women, and women are given priority when getting on and off vehicles, entering and exiting rooms. Even in some universities, female students are first, sitting in the first row in the lecture hall, which has become an unchangeable habit.

National Assembly representatives are not selected based on age, with separate old and young representatives, but there are women representatives as a separate entity. Is it possible that women are not qualified to be social elites and party representatives...? Is it possible that women representatives are only representing because they are women themselves? It seems that this is also influenced by "Women First." Is "Women First" an insult to women or respect for women?

The "Women First" trend comes entirely from Europe and America. We Chinese are just "copying" it without knowing that "Women First" is a contradiction in Europe and America.

Let's take English as an example: Except for the phrase "Ladies and Gentlemen" during speeches, where women come first, if you write a letter to Mr. and Mrs. Wang, they always write Mr. and Mrs. Wang and not Mrs. and Mr. Wang, with women coming second. This is one example. In articles, especially Americans often like to use "He or She" or "His or Her," always putting men first and women second. This is the second example. As for the word "humanity" in English, it is "Mankind" rather than "Womankind," which shows that men are sufficient to represent humans, while women are not. Calling "people" "Human Being" rather than "Huwoman Being" is also the same situation. Language is the main characteristic representing a nation and a country. In the UK and the US (the birthplace of "Women First"), there are still so many contradictions; how can we discuss others?

### Highly Optimistic

— Hui

A: "I heard that if the next world war breaks out, the war will be decided by bacteriological weapons that are more deadly than atomic bombs!"

B: "Oh! Lucky! After the next world war, China will definitely be a strong country in name and in fact!"

A: "How do you know?"

B: "Isn't it? China has plenty of bacteria!"

### Fable

— Guohong

One day, a young and vigorous youth suddenly developed a strange disease. His left hand hit his right hand, and his right hand hit his left hand, beating them until the skin was torn and the flesh was open, but he still beat them with more and more energy. Others shook their heads, confused.

### Milk and Biscuits—Blessedness Too Thin to Endure

— Xiao

National Assembly representatives transferred relief funds to Nanjing refugees, and the relief items included "milk" and "biscuits."

But it is strange that the refugees do not care about "milk and biscuits" but request "pancakes and fried dough sticks"—Is it possible that milk and biscuits are not as "nutritious" as pancakes and fried dough sticks? It is also a bit doubtful!

Logically, hunger makes one indiscriminate in food selection. There is no reason not to want biscuits but want pancakes. I guess the problem is whether they are filling or not. Although milk and biscuits have lovely names, the amount each person receives may not be more substantial than two pancakes and two fried dough sticks!

### Crying for a Blanket

— Meng Xian

"Where has the blanket gone? The old days are still filled with west winds." This has become the sigh of most public school personnel. But public school personnel would rather have tear-filled eyes and still hope that the blanket will return.

### Woolen Blanket Sobbing and Crying for Injustice

— Xiao Kangshi

Please investigate the truth thoroughly

Regarding the case of the public school personnel's wanted woolen blanket, which was announced in the previous issue of this journal, it is actually a case of injustice that cannot be redressed, and the distress cannot be expressed; the wanted warrant has been issued, and the fear is like what! Therefore, I have no choice but to express the following to the public school personnel for defense. I hope you will take a look at it so that the unjust case can be clarified—investigate the truth thoroughly and clarify where the responsibility lies!

The woolen blanket has a contract of sale, and the price is based on evidence; it was originally expected to be a lifelong companion for public school personnel, growing old together, to show warmth—but the original intermediary, the material supply agency, had malicious intentions, changed its mind halfway, slightly improved the appearance of the woolen blanket, and sold it to Pingkang at a high price; it was not voluntary, but forced! The body could not be the master, and it contained this injustice! I have never dared to violate faith and produce two hearts! It was actually the original intermediary who played tricks and profited from it!

Now that the woolen blanket has lost its body to others and the white jade has been tarnished! Public opinion is terrible, and I am extremely willing to jump out of the fire pit! I have repeatedly negotiated with the original intermediary, sincerely hoping to be a good wife (public school personnel), but the cunning intermediary is making trouble and is even using high prices to lure and threaten me to redeem myself! With the woolen blanket's weak and frail appearance, I do not dare to compete; I can only contain my grievances and weep, who will pity me? If the public school personnel and others miss the warmth and affection of the woolen blanket, they may sue the cunning intermediary for being disloyal, deceiving, and abducting the woolen blanket into Pingkang! Once there is a day for public trial, the woolen blanket will testify in court, so as to punish the cunning and vent the public's anger. I implore you to thoroughly investigate the case, as I am truly suffering!

American Blanket, respectfully

### The Organization of Beggars 18

— Huang Jiajin

True and False Travelers

The local beggar gangs in Shanghai, although trying hard to survive and penetrating everywhere, are still unkempt and haggard year after year. This is not the ambition of a man. Therefore, the general young and strong members decided to find another way, truly fulfilling their "a man's ambition lies in all directions" nature. These beggar streams, holding lofty aspirations, actually went far away and began their traveling career. This is the new route called "flying kites" in the beggar gang. However, this kind of livelihood still does not get rid of fraudulent methods. "Flying kites" means taking a boat or vehicle. Shanghai has convenient transportation, and its land and water routes are as dense as a spider web. The beggar gang can take advantage of the times and travel to various places frequently without spending a penny. Moreover, every time they go out, they are sure to "grab a hand" (beg for money). Without the true ability to be on your own, how can you start a family from scratch?

Performance on the Boat

These people pretend to be travelers on the boat every day, and their clothes are quite neat, not revealing their beggar nature. When all the passengers are on board and the boat sets sail, they begin their crying and laughing skills. First, they greet the passengers next to them and ask about their affairs, and then gradually talk about their own affairs, and then they invent their past identity, such as originally being a merchant in their hometown, but unexpectedly encountered disaster, their store went bankrupt, their wife died, and their children were scattered. It seems that all the suffering of life has gathered on them. Then they ask the passengers on the boat, and they all gather around to ask questions, listening respectfully to his speech. Chinese people have always been thick-skinned and good-natured, especially when traveling, they have plenty of leisure time and like to meddle in other people's affairs. Everyone meets by chance and feels particularly close. Soon, it spreads from ten to one hundred, and everyone can't help but feel compassion. The beggar believes that the good opportunity must not be missed, and asks the public for donations. At this time, everyone will generously donate money. In a moment, the collected amount is already considerable. When the ticket inspector comes and finds that there is no ticket, the passengers will intercede for him and give him preferential treatment. Therefore, the beggar not only rides the boat for free but also returns fully loaded. The next day, he takes another boat back to Shanghai, and can repeat the tragedy again in the same way. After a long time, the crew will inevitably see through his tricks, so he has to bribe them to silence them. Sometimes, he even needs to distribute some of the proceeds to keep things quiet. But in any case, as long as he travels a few times a month, the total income is far better than that of his peers on the streets.

This kind of "flying kites" farce is most common on the ships traveling along the Yangtze River. The second most common is on the sea ships traveling to Ningbo and Shaoxing. Originally, the Shanghai Ningbo Shaoxing Association had regulations that poor fellow villagers stranded in Shanghai could be given a free boat ticket back home by the association. The beggar pretends to be a fellow villager, but his goal is not the boat ticket but to get a letter of introduction. The letter states that he can receive two yuan from a certain place after returning to his hometown (the situation before the war). And on the boat, he can rely on a wonderful performance to get a lot of profit. It is conceivable that the association's preferential treatment has instead created a slippery business for the beggar.

Station drama

In addition to the waterway "sea mountain" (ship), they also operate in the military station. People in the gang call the train "flying centipede." But on the train, they cannot ask for help from the passengers because the feelings of the passengers are very weak, not as close as the passengers on the boat who "share the same boat." Moreover, even a fourth-class ticket cannot be avoided. They have to get off the train at their destination, and then start their crying and laughing performance when the passengers are crowded and getting off the train, asking the passengers for assistance. Several passenger cars arrive and leave a station every day. The passengers are also constantly coming, and the beggar can operate in station A one day, and then take a car to station B the next day. Although they are exhausted from traveling and working hard, the income is quite considerable. This is the new route of the "flying kites" gang out of the dock.

### If I Were to Establish a Party

— Gu

If I were to establish a party, first, I would certainly choose the best name: "Equality, Freedom, and Democracy Party." Perhaps some may think this name is too long, but because it must fit practical needs, it must be so.

Then, I must issue a declaration, stating that this party grew up among the people, therefore, we can certainly represent the true will of the people. The party's policies are based on "Equality, Freedom, and Democracy," so it must consider the people in all things. This declaration need not be long, but the words "the people" must be said as many times as possible.

As long as there are a few "cadres," then I would certainly claim that the party members are spread all over China, with an astonishingly large number—shocking, like saying the party already has 200,000,001 members. This way, it can be proven that the party represents the "majority" of the "will of the people."

With such a large number of party members, of course, some things should be done, because the party's purpose is "everything for the people"!

Therefore, I would request the government to appoint our party members to positions in the National Government organization. The president of the Executive Yuan is needed, the president of the Legislative Yuan is needed, and the director of a certain Ministry of Administration is also needed! The more, the better. When writing articles, then one should borrow a phrase: "Willing to be a dog and horse official."

If the government agrees, then we will talk about being officials later; (This party has a spirit of enterprise!) If it cannot be entirely satisfactory, then this is because the government is not democratic, we can organize ourselves.

My party will certainly soar, party members will certainly have official positions, and, "everything for the people"! Is there any party member "unsuitable"?

### Talking About Xi'an on Double Twelve

— Ye Zi

The Xi'an dialect has many dialectal components, which sounds quite interesting to outsiders. People in Xi'an call "what place" "yi ya da" (　　), like the trademark of a certain shirt in Shanghai. Also, Xi'an calls "there" "wu da" (ua), which is like the pronunciation of the Japanese surname "Uda." Other examples such as calling "head" "duo la" or "sha," are also very interesting.

The word "I" in Chang'an commonly has three pronunciations. One is "wu" (兀), like the Cantonese word for "I"; the second is "ngai" (兀), as far as the author knows, the Pearl River Delta also has this pronunciation. The third is "× ya" (wa), which is completely the same as the pronunciation of "ware" (吾) in ancient Japanese when referring to oneself. These three pronunciations have considerable value in phonological research.

A certain Western medicine store in Xi'an has the telephone number "606," and its branch has the number "914."

There is a movie theater in Xi'an called "E-pang Palace," and someone asked the owner, why not show the film "Burning of the E-pang Palace"?

In late autumn and early winter in Xi'an, there is a cheap and delicious snack called "persimmon cake," which is made by mashing ripe red persimmons, mixing them with flour, and then frying them in hot oil until fragrant. The taste is delicious, not inferior to Western "shortbread" or Cantonese "steamed sponge cake."

A week ago, the author saw an old countryman on the street, his nose painted red, wearing a sheepskin coat inside out, with the white wool exposed. He was riding backwards on a donkey, with his back facing the donkey's head and his face facing the donkey's rear end. What was most laughable was that he also hung a chamber pot (of course, brand new!) on his shoulder with a red thread. Before the procession, there were several people playing music and carrying offerings such as tea, fruit, and pastries for the gods. It was said to be the custom of an old man presenting offerings for the birth of his first child. But whether this old man was following Xi'an customs or transplanted from another village, it has not been investigated, and I dare not make a reckless judgment.

In Xi'an, at wedding celebrations, various kinds of pranks, more than half of them involve half-forced, half-willingly making the newly married couple kiss in public. It can be known that "rouge" is not imported.

"Dream of the Red Chamber" describes the customs and objects of Western Capital, and many of the place names and temple names mentioned in it still exist today. For example, the wealthy store opened by Granny Liu's (實玉嫂) maternal relatives, Wang Xifeng's (王鳳姐) family, is repeatedly mentioned in the book as being on "West Street" next to the "Drum Tower." This building and street name still exist, and it is one of the crossroads in the city center, but the "Drum Tower" has not had a drum for a long time. There is only a huge plaque on the top floor, inscribed with the words "Sound Heard in Heaven." Since the Anti-Japanese War, a simulated air raid alarm has been installed on the top floor, a coincidence.

The lowest-grade brothel district in Xi'an, "Duck Pit," is just like calling prostitutes "wild chickens" elsewhere, or Cantonese people calling them "cat holes." The idea that prostitutes are not human but domestic fowl is the same. A certain gentleman wrote "Ode to Duck Pit," and here are a few lines excerpted as follows:

"...

There are no ducks and no eggs in the pit,

The pit is full of pitiful people.

Ducks are better than people.

Ducks float on green water in the pond,

In Duck Pit, bodies are scorched by fire.

Ducks eat fish and shrimp, but don't eat ducks,

Only humans eat humans in this world!

..."
