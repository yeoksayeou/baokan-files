### Chairman to Fly to Xun Today, Then on to Lu; Marshal Ma Awaits Meeting with Stuart, Then Continues On with Madame Chiang; Three-Person Conference Expected Soon

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] Chairman Chiang is scheduled to fly directly to Jiujiang on the Meiling special plane tomorrow morning, and then proceed to Lushan. It is reported that when the special plane arrives in Xun, he will meet with the heads of the Jiangxi provincial government, military, party, and organizations, and comfort the elders of Jiangxi who have been separated for nine years, as well as compatriots from all walks of life. Accompanying him are Wu Dingchang, the Secretary-General of the National Government, and several senior officials of the National Government. The Chairman's entourage plans to travel to Xun on two separate planes. It is also learned that the Chairman, upon hearing that all sectors in Nanchang and Jiujiang were preparing grand welcomes, and fearing that the prolonged waiting in the sweltering heat would be tiresome, sent a telegram expressing his thanks. It is also reported that after a short rest in Xun, the Chairman will personally inspect Nanchang.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] It is reported that Madame Chiang plans to stay in Nanjing with Marshal Ma and his wife to await meeting Ambassador Stuart, so she plans to fly to Xun tomorrow afternoon. It is said that Marshal Ma still has matters to attend to in Nanjing, but will not stay long, as the Marshal Ma's residence in Kuanglu is ready and waiting.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 13th] Ambassador Stuart is scheduled to fly to Nanjing on the 15th.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] The negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party were unusually quiet all day today. The attention of reporters in the capital has now shifted to the Chairman's and Marshal Ma's trip to Lushan, and the arrival date of U.S. Ambassador to China, Stuart. It is reported that after Ambassador Stuart arrives in Nanjing, he will stay at Marshal Ma's residence. If Marshal Ma is to go to Lushan, it will be decided after Ambassador Stuart arrives in Nanjing. According to sources at Marshal Ma's residence today, Marshal Ma indeed intends to go to Lushan for a summer retreat. However, this is not enough to suggest that Marshal Ma is weary of the KMT-CPC negotiations. It is widely rumored in Nanjing today that the negotiations on various unresolved issues between the government and the CCP may be moved to Lushan to continue. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent personnel to Lushan half a month ago to arrange accommodation for foreign envoys stationed in China.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] According to a certain authoritative source: Judging from the current signs after the Chairman's visit to Jiangxi, it seems that the peace negotiations are still intended to continue in Nanjing. Whether the KMT-CPC negotiations will be moved to Lushan will depend on the degree of factual developments. As of 11 p.m. tonight, there has been no news of representatives from either side going to Lushan. The biggest difficulty in Lushan at present is the housing shortage, because in the past nine years, the enemy and puppets only engaged in destruction and not construction in Lushan. The Jiangxi provincial government is now actively planning to build houses.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] According to reliable sources: The military three-person conference may be moved to Lushan to be held. It is also reported that Chief of Staff Chen Cheng, due to his illness not yet recovered, is not suitable for flying and will take a specially prepared warship to Lushan. In addition, the five-person talks, which have been held four times, will not be convened at present because some issues cannot be resolved.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] The military three-person conference is expected to be held in the near future. The government is now drafting a plan in response to the CCP's request to transfer the Communist forces in the Subei and Central Plains regions to North China, in order to reasonably resolve this major side issue.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] Central Committee member Liang Hancao will return to Nanjing from Shanghai in the next few days and then proceed to Lushan to lecture at the Lushan summer camp at the invitation of the Central Headquarters of the Three Principles of the People Youth League. Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng and Minister Chen Lifu also plan to go to Lushan.

Zhou Enlai Visited Marshal Ma Yesterday
Discussed the Yellow River Blocking Issue

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] The attitude of the attendants and interpreters at Marshal Ma's residence towards the interviews of Nanjing reporters today has become more taciturn, because Marshal Ma believes that meaningless disclosures do not help the facts. However, it is learned that Zhou Enlai visited Marshal Ma at 2 p.m. today for a long talk lasting three hours, and left at 5:30 p.m. The content of the conversation covered two topics: the Yellow River flooding and relief supplies. Regarding the Yellow River issue, because the Yellow River dike repair and blocking project is imminent, the Huayuankou project is nearing completion, and the water should return to its old course. However, the Communist side has been delaying the dike repair project, and blaming the government for not paying the construction costs, making it impossible to proceed. It is reported that when Zhou Enlai met with Marshal Ma today, he said that if the government completes the Huayuankou blocking project and releases water into the old course, they will build a high embankment downstream as a "self-defense measure" to cause the Yellow River to backflow, placing Kaifeng and other places in a watery state, and asked Marshal Ma to present this idea to the Chairman on his behalf. Although this is a threatening statement, the sinister intentions of the CCP can be imagined from this. In light of the CCP's past practice of harming the people to achieve its goals, this move is particularly noteworthy. Regarding the issue of relief supplies, Zhou Enlai sent a telegram to the Director of the United Relief Agency. (Please refer to page two)

### U.S. Suggests Establishing a Buffer Zone

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 13th] Amidst the impending meeting between Du and Lin, it is reported that the U.S. is attempting to establish a buffer zone in northern Songhua River. It is learned that the Executive Group is now mediating on the north bank of the Songhua River, planning to use the Red House as a buffer zone, with the KMT and Communist armies retreating 3,000 meters each. However, the government and the CCP have not yet reached a complete agreement on this. The Songhua River is currently calm, but the situation north of Shenyang is slightly tense. It is reported that more than 10,000 Communist troops have been added to the Kuping area, seemingly intending to counterattack Faku. The signs of the Communist army withdrawing from Harbin are becoming increasingly apparent. Currently, 70 tons of vehicles are used daily to transport materials to Jiamusi and Qiqihar. It is rumored that Gu Zhutong's trip to the Northeast is related to preparations for receiving Harbin.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 13th] Du Yuming is scheduled to fly to Changchun on the 14th to meet with Lin Biao.

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 12th] Commander Du patrolled on the morning of the 12th. Fearing that it would interfere with his meeting with Lin Biao, he returned to Shenyang the same night after reaching Anshan.

### Urging Change in Political Style

[This City News] It is reported that Huang Yanpei of the Democratic League entrusted Zhou Enlai to forward a long letter to Mao Zedong, giving sincere and incisive criticism of the political style in Subei and North China. The letter included phrases such as "Whether for the sake of China or the sake of the CCP, rapid correction is necessary," and also expressed the hope for a reply from Mao.

### Zuo Shunsheng Speaks
### Convening the National Assembly is Reasonable

[French News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] Youth Party leader Zuo Shunsheng met with a reporter from the French News Agency today, discussing his views on the current situation. He said that convening the National Assembly is a reasonable move, and his party does not oppose it. There are still four months before the Assembly is convened. During this period, the following three issues must be resolved: (1) the exact number of representatives and the allocation of seats in the National Assembly; (2) the continued discussion of the constitutional issue; and (3) the reorganization of the government. He does not oppose convening a Political Consultative Conference to re-discuss the above issues, but he particularly supports adopting other methods, such as informal exchanges of views, or individual meetings between government and party representatives. However, the spirit of the five resolutions passed by the PCC should still be upheld.

### Communist Army Attacks Outer Periphery of Tianjin

[United Press, Beiping, 13th] Local newspapers reported today that the Communist army has for the first time attacked the KMT troops on the outer periphery of Tianjin. 10,000 Communist troops stationed southeast of Tianjin are advancing towards Tianjin. To ensure the safety of passengers, the weekend special train between Beiping and Tianjin has also been temporarily suspended. 10,000 Communist troops attacked Lutai, 90 miles northeast of Tianjin. The outcome of the conflict is not yet known. The Communist army in central Hebei is also becoming more active. According to military sources, the large-scale movement of the Communist army has made Baoding feel threatened. Ten regiments of Communist troops have concentrated in the Tang County and Zhengding areas. It is also rumored that the Communist army in Shijiazhuang, Gaoyi, Handan, Zhanghe, and Yuanshi are also on the move. In Shandong, 1,000 Communist troops attacked Jilei for 36 hours before retreating.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 13th] According to a Tianjin telephone call, the 76th Regiment led by Li Xiu and the 47th, 48th, and 49th Regiments of the Communist army were approaching Langfang, 20 miles south of Weishanzhuang, and east of Gu'an city on the 12th. They forced villagers to rush to build stretchers and ladders in various villages in Hewan, and requisitioned food. According to internal Communist army sources, they will disrupt the Beiping-Tianjin transportation in the next few days and attack the KMT strongholds along the route.

### He Long Commands in Fengzhen

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 13th] The Commander's Office reports that He Long has recently been personally commanding military affairs in Fengzhen, gathering six regiments of troops and is currently advancing towards Gushan (about 30 li north of Datong).

### Communist Army in Subei Occupies Linhongkou
### Advancing Towards Donghai in Separate Routes
### Communist Army in Huaiyin Prepares to Attack Yangtai

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 13th] According to military news: Linhongkou has been completely occupied by the Communist army, and it is rapidly advancing towards Donghai city in several routes. The KMT army stationed in Donghai city had to counterattack for self-defense. It is reported that there were fierce battles only ten miles northwest of the city.

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 13th] In recent days, the Communist army in Subei transferred more than 13,000 people from southern Shandong and concentrated them in Huaiyin, using civilian boats for transportation. They gathered in Gaoyou, wearing khaki uniforms with the words "Liberation" on their armbands, and were commanded by Zhang Aiping. In addition, Xu Xueshi (one leg), Mao Zedong's brother-in-law, recently led a rabble, falsely claiming to be tens of thousands of troops, with several heavy artillery pieces and more than 100 light and heavy machine guns, moving south from Huaiyin along Huainan, and it is said they are preparing to attack Yangtai counties. In addition, six regiments of troops from the Communist army under the command of Su Yu and Chen Yusheng are besieging Taixing city, and fierce fighting is underway.

[Associated Press, Beiping, 13th] It was learned here today: The situation in Xuzhou is becoming increasingly tense. The city is a strategic point connecting the Jinpu and Longhai railways. The Communist army is intensifying its attacks on the outer periphery of the city with a large force of several columns. It is reported that the Communist army in northern Anhui and northern Jiangsu has also begun to stir, apparently to probe the strength of the outer defenses of Xuzhou.

### Chen Yi Replies by Telegram that He Will Not Go to Qingdao
### Wang-Chen Meeting Fails
### KMT Army Recaptures Zichuan on the Jiaoji Railway

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 13th] The war in Shandong will continue to develop. The meeting between Wang Yaowu and Chen Yi failed to materialize. To extinguish the flames of war in Shandong, Marshall specially telegraphed the U.S. military commander in Qingdao, Clayman, to mediate the meeting between Wang and Chen. After several telegraphic exchanges, Wang Yaowu decided to fly to Qingdao this morning to meet with Chen Yi. The Military Mediation Department also agreed to this. Cai Wenzhi, Chief of Staff of the Government, flew to Jinan yesterday to study the matter with Wang Yaowu and decided to fly to Qingdao on the same plane this morning. However, Wang Yaowu suddenly received a telegram from Clayman last night, saying that Chen Yi had telegraphed him, saying that he could not go. Wang then canceled his trip. This morning, only Cai Wenzhi flew from Jinan to Qingdao, but he could not land due to a storm in Qingdao and returned. During the journey, the plane also lost its direction and nearly crashed. It could not land in Jinan, groped at low altitude, and flew back to Beiping.

[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 13th] The Qingdao peace talks originally scheduled for the 13th were canceled because Chen Yi, commander of the Communist New Fourth Army, could not attend. Clayman telegraphed Commander Ding Zhipan to inform Commander Wang Yaowu, asking him to stop coming to Qingdao.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 13th] The KMT army in Shandong recaptured Zichuan the day before yesterday. Half of the Zibo coal mining area can now be controlled. From now on, there will be no major problems with coal for Jinan city. The war on the Jiaoji Railway is still intense.

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 13th] Military news: More than 7,000 Communist troops launched a fierce attack on the KMT defense area south of Weixian again on the morning of the 12th. It is also reported that a large number of Communist troops are gathering in the mountains south of Boshan and on both sides of it, seemingly with new intentions.

### Luoshan and Hankou Agreements
### Completely Destroyed by the Communist Army

[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 13th] The Communist army (Central Plains Military Region) has completely destroyed the Luoshan Agreement of February 23 this year and the agreement established in Hankou on May 10 by Byrde, Xu Yongchang, and Zhou Enlai. Since June 25, the units under the command of Li Xiannian, "Central Plains Military Region," including Wen Jianwu, Wang Shusheng, and Zhang Tixue, have unauthorizedly crossed the area stipulated in the Luoshan Agreement (i.e., the area where the Communist troops should stay east of the Pinghan Road: Baiquanyuan, Chenjiafan, Zhoujiaweizi, Wenshusi, Zhangjiagang, Zhangjiawan, Huwan, Shitou'ao, and Zao Shu Cen), and moved east and west. Since the 29th, they have launched large-scale attacks on KMT troops in various places. Those expanding eastward have expanded about 220 kilometers, invading areas north of Huangmei and near Lihuang in Anhui Province. Those expanding westward have expanded about 270-280 kilometers, invading areas near Baokang and within the territory of Xichuan and Neixiang in Henan Province. Wherever the Communist army sets foot, they implement their consistent poisonous methods, killing the old and weak, burning houses, raping women, plundering materials, and coercing strong men, creating a great chaos in the local area. The tragic situation of ten empty houses out of ten is still expanding. On the 11th, the 2,000-strong column of Wang Shusheng of the Communist army had approached 10 kilometers southeast of Baokang and is continuing to press towards the city walls. Baokang was the rear of the front line during the War of Resistance. When the Japanese repeatedly crossed the Xiang River and invaded the west, it accommodated the refugees from the front and protected northern Sichuan, making great contributions to the War of Resistance. This area, which was not disturbed by the Japanese, is now suffering from the ravages of the Communist army, which is infinitely painful. More than 3,000 troops of Wang Shusheng's column attempted to continue crossing the Xiang River through Liushuigou (south of Yicheng) on the 12th, but were blocked by the KMT army and failed. The KMT army is also expelling the Communist army that invaded Nanzhang and recovered the city on the 11th. The people are returning from the surrounding villages and sorting out their industries that were destroyed by the Communist army. Three units of Wen Jianwu's column led by Li Xiannian crossed the Dan River on the 12th, south of Neixiang and north of Li Guanqiao, passing through Makuaipu (10 kilometers east of Xichuan), bypassing north of Xichuan, and sneaking to near Dashiqiao northwest of Xichuan, attempting to cross the Dan River to the south and invade Junxian. They are currently in fierce fighting after being blocked by the KMT army. The Communist army is now attempting to converge on Mount Wudang from the north and south, and then continue to invade the border between Sichuan and Shaanxi. Another unit of about 1,000 Communist troops sneaked to the Fangcheng Min area of Nanyang on the 12th, destroying highways and electric wires, and the materials of the local people were also looted.

### Communist Army's Intrusions in Hubei Become More Rampant
### Fierce Fighting on Both Banks of the Xiang River
### Hankou Group Flies to Laohekou Today

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 13th] Chief Cheng Qian of the Xingying recently stated at a joint party, government, and military reception for reporters: The Communist army's intrusions in Hubei are becoming increasingly rampant. The fighting on the east and west banks of the Xiang River is intense. The Communist army kills the innocent, burns homes, plunders property, and forcibly conscripts laborers wherever they go. The people are heartbroken by these four atrocities. When reporters asked about the Communist army's intentions and combat posture, Cheng replied that, judging from the current signs, the Communist army seems to be intruding towards the border of Sichuan or Shaanxi and may leave Hubei soon. When asked about the safety of Wuhan, Cheng smiled calmly and said, "The behavior of rats is difficult to prevent. Although the suffering of the people is worrying, the problem is not too serious." Finally, Cheng solemnly pointed out that all the areas intruded by the Communist army are KMT defense zones, which clearly shows who is the chief culprit. In addition, Zheng, director of the staff office of the Xingying, told reporters: Yesterday, the U.S. representative of the Ninth Executive Group asked if he was willing to hold peace talks again, and he immediately replied "Of course." The government and U.S. representatives of the group, Lu Jishi and He Zhujian, are scheduled to fly to Laohekou tomorrow to mediate peace with the Communist army headquarters. However, the Communist representative has not yet decided to go, citing that he has lost contact with the Central Plains Military Region.

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 13th] Two units of the Communist army secretly crossed the Xiang River yesterday in separate routes. Among them, the vanguard of Luo Houfu's troops has sneaked into Baokang County. Another unit of the Communist army had a fierce battle with the KMT army in Puhe Brain. They are currently being blocked on the east bank of the Xiang River and seem to be turning north. The KMT army is blocking and attacking. In addition, a unit of Li Xiannian's troops marched south from Mengjialou, attempting to invade Laohekou.

[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 13th] The Communist army has now launched an offensive against eastern Henan again and captured Zhecheng on the 12th.

Hankou Executive Group Discusses Mediation Work

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 13th] Major General Lu Jishi (newly appointed), the government representative of the Ninth Group of the Military Mediation Department, Xue Zizheng, the Communist representative, and He Zhujian, the U.S. representative, have been discussing mediation work for days after reporting on the conflict in central Hubei to Nanjing. In addition, Zheng Shaowen, the Communist Party's spokesperson in Hankou, has left Hankou with his entourage, and his office in Hankou has also been closed.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 13th] Related sources claim that Marshall summoned the Xuanhuadian and Hankou groups to inquire about the true situation after the war on the border between Henan and Hubei, and proposed a ceasefire between the two sides: (1) designate the Communist army's garrison; (2) supply the Communist army. However, no results have been achieved yet. Senior CCP officials here admitted that the Communist army's actions in the Laohekou area on the border between Henan and Hubei were to meet its "Central Plains Military Region" troops going north, and said that "the Central Plains war has a tendency to spread like wildfire." It also claimed that there would be a major war in Subei as well.

### Northeast Reaffirms Previous Order
### To Continue Arresting War Criminals

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 12th] When the Commander's Office left the pass, it followed the instructions of its superiors and promulgated regulations on the reporting of Japanese, Korean, and Taiwanese war criminals. It was re-announced in Shenyang on April 11. To date, the Commander's Office has captured 12 groups of war criminals based on public reports, totaling 52 people. After interrogation, it was determined that they were guilty. Among them, international war criminals Japanese Lieutenant General Yamaki, Major General Takeda Seiichi, Colonel Matsuda Genji, and three Italians have been transferred to the International Court for trial in separate cases. The rest have been escorted to the Northeast Military Tribunal for trial. Now that the period for sending back Japanese and Korean expatriates is approaching, it is deeply feared that war criminals who have not been reported will mingle among them and take the opportunity to escape. Therefore, the previous order is reaffirmed. All people in the Northeast who have been victimized are urged to quickly report them so that they can be punished according to the law. The names and crimes of the war criminals who have already been arrested will be announced successively.

### He Yingqin Travels from Tokyo to Yokohama to Inspect Our Naval Officers and Soldiers; Acheson Hosts Banquet Last Night

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 13th] General He Yingqin, accompanied by Qin Decheng, Vice Minister of National Defense, and Zhu Shiming, Head of the Military Representative Delegation to Japan, traveled to the Yokohama South Pier this morning to inspect our navy. Our naval officers and soldiers, dressed in immaculate white naval uniforms, stood in attention, respectfully listening to General He's address. General He arrived in Tokyo yesterday afternoon and visited General MacArthur. Ambassador Acheson, MacArthur's political advisor, will host a reception for General He, who is scheduled to depart for the United States the day after tomorrow to assume the post of Head of the Chinese Delegation to the United Nations Military Staff Committee. General He plans to visit the famous hot spring city of Atami tomorrow.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 13th, Associated Press] Acheson, MacArthur's chief foreign policy advisor and chairman of the Allied Council for Japan, hosted a banquet at the Imperial Hotel this noon to welcome General He Yingqin, and invited prominent figures from various circles to attend.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 13th] Since our naval officers and soldiers, wearing beautiful white uniforms, appeared on the streets of Tokyo, they have aroused speculation among the general public. The cleanliness and discipline of our naval uniforms have not only been highly praised by the Japanese, but have also left a deep impression on Allied personnel. A reporter overheard a Japanese woman saying to another woman, "The Chinese navy wearing the Blue Sky White Sun insignia on their shoulders have a very serious demeanor." This has aroused widespread speculation here, with Japanese people mistakenly believing that the Chinese naval officers and soldiers strolling on the shore are the vanguard of the Chinese occupation forces in Japan. Even reporters from the US military newspaper "Stars and Stripes" rushed to the Central News Agency's Tokyo office this morning to inquire whether the Chinese naval officers and soldiers appearing on the streets of Tokyo are the advance force of the Chinese occupation forces in Japan.

### UNRRA Agrees to Exclude Transportation Equipment from Suspension; LaGuardia Reports to US Senate Committee, China Office Must Be Reorganized

[Associated Press, Washington, 12th] According to reliable sources from China, due to the strong demands of the Chinese government to UNRRA in Washington, UNRRA has agreed to exclude medical supplies and transportation equipment from the suspended materials. Therefore, automobiles, locomotives, barges, gasoline, and lubricating oil have been listed alongside food and can still be shipped to China. Without the supply of transportation equipment, UNRRA will not be able to achieve the task of distributing food and supplies to the inland areas, as hoped by Director LaGuardia. In Shanghai, the UNRRA Shanghai office stated that it has not yet received official news on this matter, but believes that if this is the case, it will be announced publicly. It also stated that even if medicines and transportation tools can be shipped to China as usual, several supplies of the highest value, such as industrial and agricultural machinery and equipment, will still be on the suspension list. It also stated that it cannot currently confirm whether the complete suspension of these types of materials has been decided, but this view is very reasonable. It also stated that it is currently seeking confirmation that Chinese sources believe that LaGuardia's suspension order was caused by a mixture of misinformation, misunderstanding, and hasty action. They firmly believe that LaGuardia's actions were taken without first receiving a final telegram from UNRRA officials stationed in China, and without fully appreciating Chairman Chiang's response, "This matter is being handled by Premier Song." According to recent statistics, the situation in various Chinese ports has improved greatly in recent days. For example, in Shanghai alone, since June 27, a total of 491,237 tons of relief supplies have been accumulated, of which 464,512 tons have been distributed to the inland areas. What remains is only 10% of the original total. In fact, the handling of transportation equipment and food is better than what these numbers indicate. The delays are mainly for heavy equipment for agricultural and industrial reconstruction, which must first be unpacked and inspected in Shanghai, and then re-shipped to the inland areas.

LaGuardia Describes Details of the Suspension

[United Press, Washington, 12th] UNRRA Director General LaGuardia reported to the Senate Investigation Committee today on the details of the suspension of relief supplies to China. It is said that the telegram he sent to Chairman Chiang stated that the welfare of China is related to all the people of the country, and not just to any individual or group. Therefore, the wording was straightforward, not diplomatic, in order to make him understand the truth. The telegram stated: Assistance to China's reconstruction work must be genuine, and stated: "The welfare of your country is related to all the people of the country, and cannot be used to deal with the special interests of any individual or group. Therefore, individuals and politics cannot be involved. I believe the Chairman feels the same way." LaGuardia's telegram was sent before the announcement of the suspension of relief supplies, and also before the 300 UNRRA Shanghai employees jointly filed a complaint. LaGuardia, at the Senate Investigation Committee, attributed the responsibility for the dissatisfaction with the distribution of relief supplies in China to the Chinese government and the Executive Yuan Relief Administration, and said that the UNRRA China Office, from top to bottom, was completely ineffective and must be reorganized. LaGuardia's telegram to Chairman Chiang also stated that relief supplies were not being transported to the inland areas, but were being resold, causing most of the supplies to flow into the black market. This method must be changed. Government officials cannot be given preferential treatment in the distribution of these international relief items. UNRRA must receive more funding to facilitate its progress. To improve matters, the Chinese government can send three representatives to discuss with three UNRRA representatives to agree on a long-term plan to ensure effectiveness and integrity. LaGuardia also stated that he had not received a reply from Chairman Chiang before attending the Senate Committee earlier this week. LaGuardia appeared before the Senate Committee today at the request of Republican Senator Brewster. Brewster stated at the investigation committee that after the facts of how certain countries used UNRRA relief items are fully exposed, it will definitely become an "international corruption case." Brewster opposed the suspension of relief supplies to China, while continuing to provide relief to Yugoslavia and Poland. The abuse of UNRRA relief items in those two countries is also well known to us, he said.

### New York Times Comments on the Suspension, Only the Starving Suffer

[United States Information Service, New York, 12th] The New York Times commented yesterday that the UNRRA report submitted to Congress on June 29 believed that the difficulty of implementing relief work in China was akin to trying to climb a tree to catch a fish. It is said that unless one million tons of food can be shipped to China before the end of June 1946, five million to ten million starving people can be expected to avoid starvation. Given what "UNRRA" has done so far, these millions of starving people will obviously not be saved, and the $600 million relief plan has failed.

LaGuardia's suspension of the shipment of materials (except for staple foods) to China may be necessary in form, but only the millions of starving people suffer. We must intensify our efforts to bring about peace in China.

[Another dispatch] UNRRA confirmed today that it had received a joint complaint from 300 employees in Shanghai regarding the inefficiency of the China Office. However, LaGuardia made no comment. The Washington Evening Report commented that this matter should be given immediate attention at the highest level. UNRRA should conduct a thorough investigation and implement improvements so that United Nations aid to China can be honest, free from corruption, impartial, and with minimal waste. Americans have contributed the most to UNRRA, so they pay special attention to this case, it said.

### Legislative Yuan Finance and Economics Committee Makes Three Work Reports, Demands Responsible Officials to Give Concrete Answers to Important Current Economic Issues

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] At the 304th meeting of the Legislative Yuan, Zhang Zhaoyuan, a member of the Finance, Economics, Commerce, and Trade Joint Committee, made the third work report, reviewing recent related issues: (1) After the grain loan fraud case occurred in Shanghai, the price of rice per stone jumped from more than 30,000 yuan to 70,000 to 80,000 yuan. After the Resource Committee and the Taiwan Provincial Government jointly established the Taiwan Sugar Company, the domestic sales price of Taiwan sugar per catty suddenly rose from more than 600 yuan to more than 1,400 yuan. Gasoline, automobiles, milk powder, etc., which were originally imported goods, did not rise in price under the efforts of foreign merchants to eliminate the black market. (2) Domestic industries cannot operate due to excessive production costs, and there are cases where they stop production and sell raw materials and machines to pay workers' severance pay. (3) Due to the sharp rise and fall of the bond market in the Shanghai financial market, a major disaster occurred at the end of June, with estimated losses of 150 billion yuan. Several banks and firms went bankrupt as a result. The government's failure to dispel market rumors in a timely manner was largely to blame. (4) UNRRA recently suddenly announced the suspension of the shipment of industrial and agricultural machinery and other relief items to China, and made accusations against our country's distribution methods. The conclusion is that the occurrence of the above problems is further proof of human malfeasance and policy imprudence. Such things should be hated by the highest leaders, and the Executive Yuan certainly does not want to bear the responsibility. This committee has decided to ask the directly responsible主管人员 to give concrete answers, it said.

Authorities Crack Down on Illegal Private Banks

### Editorial: Overseas Chinese Compatriots Need Security

When the Father of the Nation was alive, he often said, "Overseas Chinese are the mother of the revolution." Because more than fifty years ago, we, the revolutionary patriots in the country, under the leadership of the Father of the Nation, opposed the autocratic rule of the Qing Dynasty and began a widespread movement to completely eliminate corrupt politics. We were often oppressed by the tyrannical politics of the time and had to flee overseas. Without the economic and manpower assistance of overseas Chinese compatriots, the success of the first national revolution of our Chinese nation would have been even more arduous and slower.

Overseas Chinese compatriots have also proven to have made great contributions during this long eight-year war of resistance. In the beginning, they donated money and aircraft enthusiastically. Later, during the Japanese invasion of Southeast Asia, the lives and property of overseas Chinese compatriots in Burma, Vietnam, Malaya, Java, Sumatra, Singapore, the Philippines, and other places were also subjected to extreme killings and damages. Overseas Chinese compatriots, regardless of the period or environment, although geographically separated from the motherland, have always looked forward to the revitalization of the motherland. In the future, under the guidance of the Chairman, we will begin to build a democratic country based on the Three Principles of the People. We need the overseas Chinese compatriots even more to contribute their strength to help the motherland achieve this task as soon as possible.

Our expectations of overseas Chinese compatriots are so great. However, judging from what overseas Chinese compatriots in various places are currently experiencing, it is truly too painful and too unfortunate. Overseas Chinese compatriots in Siam were the first to suffer massacres, and recently, overseas Chinese compatriots in the Dutch East Indies have also suffered large-scale massacres and attacks, which have not yet been completely quelled. In addition, according to the reports we have received, governments in the Philippines, Malaya, Australia, Vietnam, and other places have also imposed legal oppression and restrictions on local overseas Chinese compatriots. Overseas Chinese compatriots originally thought that because we had made great contributions in this war of the Allied nations to eliminate the Axis powers and established national prestige, after the end of the war, we could obtain security in our lives and receive more courteous treatment from local governments in various parts of Southeast Asia. Who knew that today, looking at the facts that are currently being presented, the result is the opposite. The overseas lives of our "mother of the revolution" are being subjected to humiliation, oppression, and massacre, even more severely than before August 13th. Upon careful reflection, the motherland has let them down in terms of responsibility and human sentiment!

It is well known throughout the world that the temperament of our Chinese nation is gentle, peaceful, and kind. Overseas Chinese compatriots abide by the law in various places and are unwilling to slightly overstep the rules, which is also recognized by local governments. Overseas Chinese compatriots have always responded to all insults with extreme patience and tolerance. In terms of work, overseas Chinese compatriots have always been diligent, thrifty, and tireless, using their blood and sweat to develop wilderness in various parts of Southeast Asia and create today's prosperity. It is not an excessive demand for overseas Chinese compatriots in various parts of the world to obtain safety and security, but a right that they should naturally be able to enjoy. However, as the saying goes, "Good people are bullied." The exceptionally honest behavior of overseas Chinese compatriots has instead formed the perception that they are easy targets for bullying, which is truly inappropriate.

The government should use all possible means to secure the safety of the more than 15 million overseas Chinese compatriots. When necessary, the government should not hesitate to adopt a strong stance and must not casually settle matters with a mere protest, and sometimes even be afraid to raise a protest. For example, Siam was originally a small clown role on the side of the Axis powers in this war. In theory, we have the right to punish her a little. When she even overestimated herself and massacred our overseas Chinese compatriots this spring, we could have immediately dispatched a large army from the Vietnam side to enter the northwest border of Siam as a backup for reasoning. Unexpectedly, the government was extremely tolerant and sent a delegation to humbly seek advice, saying many friendly words before perfunctorily settling the matter. However, if Siam again mistreats our overseas Chinese compatriots next time, we should no longer adopt such an overly gentle and humble attitude. For example, in Vietnam, as soon as the national army withdrew, the old laws that abused overseas Chinese compatriots were reportedly gradually being restored. If this is true, we can honestly tell the French government that Vietnam has deep historical ties with our country. All of France's rights in Vietnam were forfeited cleanly by the shameless Vichy government during this war because of its submission. Now that we have taken it back from the enemy and returned it to France, if France treats our overseas Chinese compatriots in Vietnam unkindly, we should also have the right to take it back again. We should now sincerely tell the Indonesian government that if that government can no longer restrain the anti-Chinese and abusive atrocities of the people, then the heroic independence movement of that country will not be sympathized with by us, and we must aid overseas Chinese compatriots and give them the power of self-defense and resistance. Regardless of the place, if we have reason to speak, our attitude towards protecting overseas Chinese compatriots should not be too soft or humiliating. Because overseas Chinese compatriots live scattered all over the world, often our well-intentioned concessions to one place will instead cause misunderstandings in other places, leading them to believe that our overseas Chinese compatriots can be bullied at will.

Regarding the question of how we should help overseas Chinese compatriots, from the reception of those returning to the country during the war to the repatriation to their original places after the war, the central government has stipulated many things. However, the most important and urgent thing at present is nothing more than safeguarding their safety in various parts of the world. We are a country that establishes itself through peace and will never use overseas Chinese as vanguards for invading other people's land. However, when others deliberately infringe upon the safety of our overseas Chinese compatriots, the government of the motherland cannot turn a blind eye.

### The Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference Concludes; Draft Peace Treaties for Five Nations Have Been Prepared; The German and Austrian Issues Remain Divided

[Our Newspaper] London, 13th - The Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference is nearing its end. The finalization of the draft peace treaties for the five nations of Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland shows that cooperation among the four powers is not only possible but also substantial. However, during the final stages of the conference when discussing the issues of Germany and Austria, opinions remained greatly divided, reminiscent of the stalemate at last year's London Foreign Ministers' Conference. The greatest achievement of this Foreign Ministers' Conference is the method for dealing with colonial territories and special ports. If the four powers cannot reach an agreement when ultimately resolving these issues in the future, they can be submitted to the United Nations for handling. This sets an important precedent and is a significant contribution to the collective power of world organizations.

[Reuters] Paris, 12th - The Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, after several weeks of meetings, concluded tonight. The remaining unresolved issues in the draft peace treaties for the five nations of Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland were all submitted to the Twenty-One Nations Peace Conference for discussion. During today's final meeting, Molotov opposed the Four-Power Foreign Ministers conducting preliminary discussions on the Austrian peace treaty and rejected Bevin's request to quickly determine the German assets within Austria. He also opposed the establishment of an agreement regarding the centralization of German administration. During this morning's meeting, Bevin stated that he would urgently consider the United States' proposal to unify the German economy and clarified that Britain could not accept the Soviet Union's interpretation of the reparations portion of the Potsdam Agreement. Byrnes today continued to strongly advocate for the unification of the German economy and presented several sections from the Potsdam Declaration to support his argument. The four foreign ministers also discussed the issue of distributing Italian warships to Yugoslavia and Greece tonight. They agreed to hand over 5,000 tons of warships and auxiliary vessels to Yugoslavia, with 50% being warship tonnage. The details of the distribution would be decided by the naval committee. British Foreign Secretary Bevin also suggested that an Italian cruiser should be given to Greece to compensate for the Greek cruiser that was sunk, and it was agreed to transfer a medium-sized cruiser to Greece.

[Central News Agency] Paris, 12th (Associated Press) - The four foreign ministers have approved the recommendations made by the Italian Colonial Territories Committee. According to the recommendations, Italy will relinquish all rights and titles to its African territories. The current regime in the territories should continue to exist until the final disposition is decided. The final disposition should be decided when the governments of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union sign the peace treaty.

[US Information Service] Washington, 12th - Acting Secretary of State Acheson stated at a press conference today that the President's special aircraft, "Sacred Cow," has arrived in Paris to transport Secretary of State Byrnes back to the United States. He said: "I do not know what plan Byrnes has decided upon, but I expect that he will leave Paris tomorrow with advisors Senators Connally and Vandenberg and arrive in Washington on Sunday." Part of the Secretary of State's staff will remain in Paris to arrange the Peace Conference, which opens on the 29th of this month.

### France and the Soviet Union Clash Over German Policy; Anglo-French Alliance to be Revived; London is Displaying Courtship; Churchill's Speech is of Great Significance

[Reuters] Paris, 12th - It is rumored that the British and French governments have resumed negotiations to conclude a treaty of alliance, and the accuracy of this rumor can be proven after Churchill delivers a speech in Metz, France, on the French border on Sunday afternoon. Churchill is going to Metz in a private capacity, but because he is the leader of the opposition party in the British Parliament, and it comes at a time when the Soviet Union's rejection of French policy towards Germany has greatly surprised the French, Churchill's speech is sure to have significant political significance. Since Molotov advocated for the establishment of a centralized German government at the Foreign Ministers' Conference, French public opinion has felt isolated. It is expected that Churchill's speech will make the French feel that at least Britain is expressing sympathy with them. Churchill will reiterate his previous remarks, expressing his belief that France has the ability to revive and acquire an important position in the international community. Regarding the Anglo-French alliance, British Foreign Secretary Bevin recently stated in the House of Commons that he was willing to conclude an alliance with France. Although this proposal has not yet begun to be implemented, it is expected that efforts will be made to make it a reality soon.

### Procedures for the Peace Conference

Distributed to Participating Countries

[Our Newspaper] Nanjing, 13th - Diplomatic sources: The Foreign Ministers' Conference on the 8th of this month decided on several principles of procedure and distributed them to participating countries as suggestions. The resolution is as follows: (1) The procedures shall be adopted by the Peace Conference with a majority vote; (2) The Peace Conference shall establish a General Committee of the whole body, voting by a two-thirds majority; (3) Political groups shall be established for Italy, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, and Finland, and only the declaring countries shall participate. Although France may participate in the discussions of the four groups of Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland, it shall not have the right to vote. Two other groups, economic and military, shall be established; (4) In cases passed by a two-thirds majority, a minority of countries may present their views to the General Assembly; (5) In cases not passed by a two-thirds majority, they may be submitted to the General Assembly for discussion and voting.

Anti-Communist Faction Holds Absolute Advantage

Among the 19 cabinet members, the Christian Democratic Party occupies eight seats, the Communist Party four seats, the Socialist Party four seats, the Republican Party two seats, and independents one seat. According to this allocation, it shows that the anti-communist faction holds an absolute advantage.

### The Soviet Union Denies Coveting Persian Gulf Seaports

### The British Government Announces the Contents of the Anglo-Polish Loan

[Reuters] London, 12th - The British government has published a white paper announcing the contents of the financial agreement concluded between Britain and Poland.

Repayment of the remaining £1.5 million will also not be requested for the time being. Poland's non-military debt to Britain, including refugee accommodation fees paid by Britain, totals £32 million. The Polish government will first repay £3 million of this in gold, and the remaining £10 million will be repaid in annual installments after five years, spread over fifteen years.

### The British Government is Confident in Securing Soviet Trust and Understanding; Bevin Declared in the House of Commons

[Central News Agency] London, 12th - During a short debate on Anglo-Soviet relations in the British House of Commons last night, Minister of State Hector McNeil stated that the British government deeply believes that it is possible to secure the trust of the Soviet Union and dispel its suspicions. The debate was initiated by Labour MP Aidan Esmond Crawley, who strongly advocated for close Anglo-Soviet relations. He solemnly pointed out the necessity of establishing close commercial relations between Britain and the Soviet Union and suggested the establishment of joint commercial companies in all areas where British and Soviet interests converge, in order to ensure cooperation and avoid conflict. McNeil, on behalf of the government, replied that the Labour government had sincerely sought cooperation with the Soviet Union in accordance with the spirit of the United Nations Charter and believed that Britain would eventually gain the trust of the Soviet Union. When discussing the importance of economic factors in establishing lasting peace, he regretted that many European countries placed too much importance on the importance of borders. He stated: "Economic factors cannot be separated from political factors, because if countries adopt policies of economic nationalism, it will inevitably lead to poverty and unrest, and then inevitably lead to war." He believed that a good understanding and concerted action between Britain and the Soviet Union could never be achieved by any system of diplomatic haggling or the establishment of spheres of influence. It must rely on compliance with the various principles of the United Nations Charter. He finally asked the members to recall the unpleasant experiences the Soviet Union had with Western democracies before the war, and it was natural for the Soviet Union today to suspect whether the new democracies outside the Soviet Union were genuine or fraudulent. Britain is eager to prove to the Soviet Union that Britain has the sincerity to dispel suspicions.

### The Soviet Union Receives German Assets in Bulgaria; US Authorities Issue Statement; The Declaration of the United Nations is Applicable

[US Information Service] Washington, 12th - When Acting Secretary of State Acheson was interviewed by reporters today, he was asked about the news of the Soviet Union receiving former German property in Bulgaria. The Acting Secretary of State stated that he had seen this report, but the State Department had not yet received official information about this Soviet action. He was asked what attitude the United States would take towards this matter. Acheson explained that the United States' relationship with Bulgaria was different from its relationship with Hungary. Acheson asserted: There is a common point between Bulgaria and Hungary, namely, the Declaration of the United Nations on January 18, 1943, regarding the forced transfer of materials, is applicable. Acheson explained: The United States believes that the ownership of property seized by the enemy from nationals or companies of the Allied countries still belongs to the Allied countries or their nationals. On the other hand, the Soviet Union's view is that property received by Germany is considered German property. Acheson further explained: The United States does not demand that genuine German property be returned to the Bulgarian government, but the situation in Austria is different because the Moscow Declaration of 1943 called for a free and independent Austria. Therefore, the United States is willing to discuss with the Allied countries and Austria the return of part of the German property acquired by the United States to the Austrian government.

After two consecutive accidents involving Constellation aircraft in half a month, the US government ordered the temporary grounding of this type of aircraft yesterday to investigate the accident near Reading, Pennsylvania, where a Constellation aircraft crashed, killing five people.

### Nehru Advocates Abolishing Foreign Territorial Rights in India - Postal and Telegraph Strike Spreads Nationwide

[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 12th Dispatch] Indian National Congress President Nehru presented a report to the party's general assembly today, expressing dissatisfaction with France and other countries enjoying territorial rights within India. He stated that France and other foreign countries cannot continue to retain territory in free India, but these countries can continue to maintain their culture in India. Therefore, the Pondicherry district (French colony in India) can become an area of French culture. In fact, we should welcome this, as we aspire to develop cultural relations with France. In short, the disposal of foreign colonies will be decided by the local residents themselves.

[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 12th Dispatch] The postal, telegraph, and telephone workers' strike in New Delhi and Bombay Province is expected to spread nationwide.

[United Press, Yokohama, 12th Dispatch] The commander of the US Eighth Army occupying Japan, Eichelberger, issued a warning to his troops on the 22nd of last month, stating that US military crimes are increasing and strict measures will be taken to stop them. The contents of the warning were announced today. It is said that the unlawful behavior of the US military has provoked retaliation from the Japanese, which endangers the occupation mission. Reports of US military crimes have recently increased, including individuals or groups beating Japanese people, breaking into homes to steal pocket money from poor residents, destroying furniture and windows, and assaulting women on roads and in homes. The arrogant attitude of some US soldiers has led to widespread reports, which I believe to be true, and will be severely punished.

### The Huge Devaluation of the Hungarian Currency - Unbelievable

Now Replaced by an "Index Coupon"

[United Press, Hungarian Capital, 12th Dispatch] The devaluation of the Hungarian currency, the "Pengő," has reached an unbelievable level, requiring 500,000,000,000,000,000,000 Pengős to equal one US dollar. Before the war, one Pengő was worth 29.12 US cents. The Ministry of Finance ordered today that the current Pengő be withdrawn and replaced with the "Index Pengő," also known as the "Tax Pengő," which was issued in January of this year and initially used for tax payments. The value of the Index Coupon is based on various other indices, with 6.5 million exchanging for one US dollar. Officials hope that the Index Coupon will remain stable until August 1, when a new currency, the "Forint," will be issued, the value of which has not yet been announced.

### Endless Wealth and Glory to See - Post-War American Society Appears - Inexhaustible Pessimism and Separation to Write

—Our Newspaper Special Correspondent in the United States, Mao Shuqing—

On Sunday morning, the sound of bright bells echoed over the Hudson River. The old pastor of the Claremont Church, with his sparse white hair, prayed for the devout men and women. He said, "Today, we Americans have inexhaustible material pleasures, but we have neglected a reasonable spiritual life. God has given us infinite grace, but we have let God down?" The old pastor's words touched the hearts of every American! A Life magazine reporter wrote a dispatch back to the country, saying that American children were participating in the black market trade in Shanghai. American reporters in Paris wired back reports of American children drinking, committing violence, and engaging in love rivalries. The landlady's child, who is still stationed in France, said, "The child once returned home after being discharged, but less than two months later, he voluntarily re-enlisted and went to Europe." The old lady asked me, "What charm do European girls have? What has captivated my child?" On the day that General MacArthur narrowly escaped an accident, every newspaper in New York carried the headline of a $663,000 fraud case. The photo of the fraudster, William朋吉朋, stood side by side with MacArthur's portrait. This big fraudster was caught in New York. "In just three months, it was $663,000!" New York newspaper readers, on the subway, in the office, and in coffee shops, all read this news very seriously. They could ignore the news of the Paris Four Foreign Ministers' Conference, because those meetings were "government affairs," or even "Bernanos' affairs."

Daughter's Lightning Marriage - Angered the Master of Humor

Similarly, the story of Miss Lin Rus, the daughter of Lin Yutang, eloping was published on the third page of the New York Daily News with a large headline. The young lady eloped to Boston to marry a 26-year-old Lieutenant Bi'e of the US Naval Aviation Corps in order to avoid her father's opposition. Lin Yutang called them both from New York: he was unwilling to bless them because he opposed any "blitzkrieg marriage." The American Evening News, which usually doesn't sell very well, broke sales records in two days because it published a special article: "How I Killed Mussolini." Colonel Fan Leo was an Italian Communist. When Mussolini's Republican Fascist regime in northern Italy collapsed at the end of April last year, Fan Leo rushed from Milan to Tango, snatched Mussolini and his mistress, 巴蒂湘, from another unit, and then used a jeep to transport them to a secluded town, where they were machine-gunned to death without trial. The disorganization of the marriage system in the United States is rare in any country. In Huston, Montana, a 74-year-old man named Han Dun married for the first time when his wife died, divorced for the second time, and recently married for the third time on Easter. The bride, Vina, was only 16 years old. Five days later, news reporters reported Vina's disappearance. It turned out that the 74-year-old Han Dun was a landowner with more than 800 acres of land. The condition of their marriage was that the bride could enjoy a certain percentage of the land after Han Dun died. But because there was no "spiritual life," Han Dun did not die, and the bride eloped alone.

Only Two Reporters Needed - No Shortage of News

Yellow news newspapers only need to send two field reporters every day to guard the prosecutor's office of the New York Court, and the newspaper's news sources can be inexhaustible and inexhaustible. With a large metropolis of 7.7 million people, social order is inherently difficult to maintain, and Americans admire their court prosecutor's office. American lawyers believe that the New York prosecutor's office is a miracle in judicial history. Americans say: If Mr. Dewey had not laid the foundation for this prosecution system back then, how chaotic would it be if we had to rely on a few police officers to maintain social order now? There are now as many as 70 judges, 10 accountants, 10 investigation experts, 60 plainclothes detectives, and more than 100 other staff members in the New York prosecutor's office. The prosecutor's office has the power to direct the police throughout New York City and prosecutes more than 40,000 cases each year. Among these 40,000 cases, there are stories of joy and sorrow, stories of murder and robbery, and terrible crises lurking in society. A sixteen-year-old child in the Bronx (across the river from New York) beat a fifty-six-year-old woman to death simply because he "hated her to the bone." Another fourteen-year-old child took care of a neighbor's baby. The baby cried, and the child suffocated her, for only two minutes, and the three-year-old baby died. The sixteen-year-old and fourteen-year-old children were brought to court one after another. Ingersoll, the editor-in-chief of the New York afternoon newspaper, wrote an editorial on a full page: How does the law judge a fourteen-year-old murderer? He said: This is not a simple legal issue, but the most serious educational issue in the United States.

Chalk Master's Life is Bitter - Education is in a Slump

Observing (Observing?) initially called out "American Education Bankruptcy." A Mr. Harlan Rogan loudly exclaimed: "American education now uses textbooks from the 1914 era and teaching methods from fifty years ago!" According to the American friends I have come into contact with, all those with intelligence and talent are unwilling to engage in education. The biggest reason is that the teachers' living conditions are too low, which is not enough to burden the life of a family. According to the old statistics of 1942 and 1943: the average annual salary of rural school teachers in the United States was 1,018 yuan, the average annual salary of middle school teachers was 1,901 yuan, and the average annual salary of university lecturers was 1,872 yuan. The annual salary of shipbuilding workers reached 3,375 yuan, and the annual salary of printing workers reached 3,249 yuan. After the end of the war, the statistical figures may have changed somewhat, but the harsh life of teachers in the United States, a country that is first in industry and commerce, is an indisputable fact. Because talents are eliminated instead, those who are unqualified fill the ranks of the American education sector. A few days ago, a female teacher in a rural elementary school near New York allowed a boy to go out and spend the night, and taught him various indecent behaviors, which aroused the accusations of parents throughout the village. American movies penetrate every corner of rural society, but the education that movies give to children is nothing more than love and assassination! Many people say that American university education is more lacking than before. The number of students has increased, but the teaching materials of professors are still the same old blueprints that have not changed for many years. A Chinese scholar recently came to New York because he had been sealed in Sichuan for many years and wanted to find some new American books on related subjects to supplement them, but he was very disappointed: "The textbooks used by American universities today are still the same set I used when I studied in the United States." But no university administrators are pessimistic. Wartime is an abnormal phenomenon. After the war, they believe that the golden age of academic culture will blossom and bear fruit in the United States. European exiled professors and first-class scholars have all been exiled in the United States. The United States, this great melting pot of the world, will create a brand-new road for the academic world throughout the world. (Sent from New York on June 14)

This was delayed until yesterday morning before they could be purchased.

[Further News] Director Chen Wenkuan's "No. 21" plane, which flew to Jinan for investigation, arrived in Jinan at 2:20 p.m. that day.

In addition, the Municipal Public Works Bureau hosted the Xi'an reporter delegation this morning at 10:00 a.m. to visit Wusong.

### A Category 10 Hurricane Discovered in Northern Guam - Will This City Be Spared from the Attack?

The city's third hurricane, after landing in northern Fujian the day before yesterday, will soon disappear. According to a report from the Sino-American Meteorological Bureau, a major hurricane of Category 10 or higher was discovered north of Guam on the afternoon of the 12th. The US Navy immediately sent planes to Guam to investigate, and the results confirmed that the hurricane was traveling northwest at a speed of 15 knots per hour at 14.9 degrees north latitude and 137.0 degrees east longitude yesterday afternoon. The strength of the wind is the strongest seen this year. If the wind direction and speed remain unchanged, it will invade the Philippines in four days, and this city will inevitably be hit head-on.

Obstructing the Resumption of Import and Export Cargo Ships

The hurricane that arose in the South Pacific has now disappeared. Cargo ships that were unable to export due to wind obstruction the day before yesterday, such as Taikoo & Co.'s Hanyang Wheel and Shandong Wheel, Jardine Matheson & Co.'s Hesheng Wheel (all sailing to Hong Kong), China Merchants Bureau's Peide Wheel (sailing to Guangdong), and Jinhai Wheel (sailing to Taiwan), Dalae & Co.'s Malkas Wheel, etc., a total of six ships, all cleared customs and exported yesterday.

### Two Ambulances Collide at Nanjing Road Throwing Ball Field - Sino-American Hospital Vehicle Overturns - Making it Difficult for the Sick

[Our Paper Report] At 1:50 p.m. yesterday, a collision between two ambulances occurred at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Henan Road. The Central Fire Department received a call from the Zhabei Police Station that a citizen was suffering from a sudden illness, so ambulance No. 81, driven by Xu Jinfu, went to the scene. Unexpectedly, just as it was about to turn north at the throwing ball field, an ambulance from the Sino-American Hospital, driven by Lu Xuming, carrying a Russian patient, Bai Liqie, and Bai's mother and younger brother, Haiqie Tuo, was coming from Nanjing Road from west to east. The two vehicles failed to yield to each other at the intersection, resulting in ambulance No. 81 colliding with the front wheels of the Sino-American Hospital's ambulance. As a result, the Sino-American Hospital's ambulance overturned, and the patient in the car was also injured. The traffic in the area was blocked for a long time after the accident. The Fire Department then dispatched another vehicle to send the Russian patient to Gongji Hospital for treatment. The police are investigating the responsibility of the two drivers.

### Today is French National Day - Overseas Chinese Celebrate, Knight Invested

[Our Newspaper's Report] Today is French National Day. The French expatriate community here will hold a celebration to commemorate it. At 10:00 AM, the French Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Pélissier, will hold a reception at the French Consulate on Jinling Road to entertain all French expatriates in Shanghai. At 10:30 AM, Mayor Wu and his wife, as well as diplomatic envoys from various countries, will be invited.

Mr. Davis has resided in Shanghai for many years and is an engineer with many French friends. During the occupation of Shanghai, when French citizens were being arrested by the Japanese invaders, Mr. Davis repeatedly risked his life to communicate with his French friends and assist them, sparing no effort. Later, he himself was arrested by the Japanese army and imprisoned in the Bridgehead Building, and later moved to the Jiangwan concentration camp, where he was subjected to brutal torture in an attempt to make him reveal the secret movements of the French. However, Mr. Davis endured the suffering and refused to disclose any information, resulting in him being crippled. After the victory, he was released, and the French have great respect for him, admiring him and calling him "Knight."

### Two German Overseas Chinese Who Fled - Arrested and Sent to Concentration Camp

[Our Newspaper's Report] When the first group of German expatriates in this city were sent back to their country on the 7th of this month, eight people escaped. According to an investigation by the German Expatriate Management Committee, two of them, Mr. Schott and Mrs. Heilborn, have been arrested and imprisoned in the Jiangwan Qimei Road concentration camp. Mrs. Heilborn claims to have divorced Mr. Heilborn. According to the investigation, Mrs. Heilborn is in her thirties, acts very mysteriously, and her lifestyle is quite unrestrained. Two others, Mr. Zippel and Mr. Borkeber, are reportedly hiding in the United States. Mr. Weisslandner and Mr. Klandt are hiding in Nanjing. Mr. Waffmeister claimed to have been granted permission by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to remain in Shanghai, but when the second notice was delivered, he was out, so the situation is unknown. His current residence has also been sealed off, and he went to the German Expatriate Management Committee to request its recovery. The whereabouts of Mr. Herschke are unknown. Mr. Laurence, who attempted suicide unsuccessfully, is now permitted to remain in Shanghai. Currently, there are approximately forty German expatriates, men, women, and children, detained in the concentration camp. There is still no news regarding the second batch of repatriations.

### Restaurants and Tea Houses - Night Market Hours Not Allowed to be Extended

[Our Newspaper's Report] Some restaurants and cafes in this city, due to the lifting of the curfew, have petitioned the Municipal Police Bureau to request an extension of business hours. However, the Police Bureau believes that extending the business hours of restaurants and entertainment venues is not yet appropriate, so all requests have been denied. Furthermore, the Jin Gu Hotel on Xizang Road in this city has frequently been operating beyond the permitted hours. Despite warnings from the Police Bureau, it continued to do so. Yesterday, it was ordered to close for three days as a disciplinary measure.

### Pork Article - Liberated Pigs Come Rolling In, Shanghai Smells of Pork Everywhere

Meat (referring to pork) should be placed in the most important position in terms of food. The famous line from the sage, "For three months, he did not know the taste of meat," has been passed down through the ages and is still widely recited. This is enough to illustrate that "meat" is indeed a tempting noun for human life.

The fortunate people of Shanghai are truly blessed when it comes to enjoying meat. Look, every corner of Shanghai is filled with the smell of meat every day.

According to reliable statistics, approximately 50,000 pigs are sacrificed each month to "tribute" to the citizens of Shanghai, averaging around 1,600 per day. Can you say that this is a small number? Of course, if we make further calculations: assuming each pig weighs 100 jin (approximately 50 kg), and Shanghai has 3.5 million people, the average allocation per person is still less than 1 liang (approximately 50 grams) of pork. This trivial amount is not worth mentioning, is it?

Don't just talk about how much pork there is; diners only know that pork tastes good in their mouths, but who knows the sour and bitter taste in the aroma? The source of pork is not easy, and the situation of merchants is also difficult.

Shanghai is a place where industry and commerce gather. Farmers in the suburbs also raise pigs. Except for a small number of people from Jiangbei (north of the Yangtze River) who raise pigs in the western part of Shanghai to supply the market, 95% of the supply must be sourced from the pig-producing areas north and south of the Huai River and the Jiangbei region.

The pork we usually eat in Shanghai falls into two categories: (1) Huai pigs (also known as train pigs because they are transported to Shanghai by rail), whose origin is in areas north and south of the Huai River, such as Xuzhou, Shangqiu, Suxian, Mingguang, and Bengbu. (2) Jiangbei pigs, whose origin is in areas such as Nantong, Huaiyin, Rugao, Taixing, Gaoyou, and Yangzhou. Currently, due to transportation and other factors, the supply of Jiangbei pigs is lower than that of Huai pigs. Jiang pigs account for 45%, and Huai pigs account for 55%.

Most of the above-mentioned production areas belong to the Chinese Communist "Liberated Areas". Merchants who sell must go through hardships to purchase pigs and enter "foreign territory". Banknotes are not commonly used in the Communist areas. The purchase of pigs in Jiangbei mostly adopts a barter system, exchanging miscellaneous grains for piglets, which is simply a "spectacular" sight in the market of the modern century. This method is very difficult for merchants because the prices in the two regions fluctuate, and if the prices are not right, they will lose money. Taking the recent pork market prices as an example, merchants are actually losing 20,000 yuan per pig.

Merchants transport the pigs to Shanghai through pig brokers, who then sell them to pork shops. Between the multiple transfers, plus more than a dozen other direct or indirect taxes and fees, the price of pork naturally increases.

It is the summer season, and people have reduced their appetite for pork, and the pork market is gradually declining. The source is not easy, the cost is high, the taxes and fees are heavy, and business is not as good as before the war. Pork merchants shake their heads and sigh.

National affairs are unpredictable, and the clouds of war are unpredictable. Some people are wondering: if a war breaks out and the source of pigs is cut off, will Shanghai experience a "meat shortage"? Pork merchants say: the magic lies in people's ingenuity, Shanghai people don't need to worry, there is plenty of pork. (Jiang Jun)

### Once Qingdao Port is Repaired - It Will Not Be Difficult to Become a Good Coastal Port

Mao Yisheng Goes to Hangzhou to Inspect the Qiantang Project

Hou, head of the Engineering Planning Team, and Du De, chief engineer, went to Nanjing a few days ago to discuss the reorganization of national transportation with the transportation authorities. They returned to Shanghai by plane on the 12th. Vice-head Mao Yisheng went to Hangzhou yesterday to inspect the Qiantang project. Reports from the railway and highway groups of the team have been drafted, and the report from the port group is also about to be completed. Regarding the restoration plans for Qingdao and Lianyungang ports, Mr. Liang, the secretary-general of the team, told reporters: (1) Qingdao faces a deep-water, ice-free port. During the German lease period, the port built six or seven large and small docks, as well as an inner harbor dock specifically for wooden boats and fishing boats to dock. Engineer Shao Fuwu's impression after visiting this time was very good. According to his report: the port's wartime losses were not very heavy. Only slight repairs are needed to restore it to its former scale, and it can become the primary good port on the coast. (2) Lianyungang is very close to the old course of the Yellow River and is affected by siltation throughout the year. Ocean-going ships cannot dock. The current scale of reconstruction is limited by natural conditions and cannot be started. In the future, it can only be used as a supplementary port, restoring the standard that allowed 3,000-ton ships to dock in the past. As for the freight transportation of the Longhai Railway, it can be rerouted through the ports of Qingdao and Pukou.

### Taishan Apartment - Sensational Murder Case - Lin Buwu and Wang Zhengzhong - Sentenced to Death

[Our Newspaper's Report] The sensational Taishan Apartment murder case has been heard three times by the District Court, and the trial has concluded. At 10:30 AM yesterday morning, Judge Cao Zuwei ascended the court to announce the verdict: "Lin Buwu, jointly committing murder, sentenced to death, deprived of civil rights for life. Possessing military-use pistol bullets without permission and without a proper reason, sentenced to one year of imprisonment. Receiving stolen goods, sentenced to eight months of imprisonment, to be executed with the death penalty, deprived of civil rights for life. Wang Zhengzhong, jointly committing murder, sentenced to death, deprived of civil rights for life. Possessing military-use pistol bullets without permission and without a proper reason, sentenced to eight months of imprisonment. Theft, sentenced to two years of imprisonment, to be executed with the death penalty, deprived of civil rights for life. One pistol (Yu Ning brand, No. 4160) with eleven bullets, one revolver (S.W. brand, No. 203) with eight bullets, thirty-one rifle bullet heads, and one hundred and twenty-two other various military bullets are to be confiscated." After hearing the verdict, the two criminals immediately changed their calm attitude when they appeared in court, and their faces suddenly turned pale, and they bowed their heads and said nothing. Judge Cao explained: "The defendants in this case are both intellectuals. If they could have stepped onto the right path, they would have been able to accomplish something. Now that they have strayed onto the wrong path, according to legal principles, their crimes cannot be reduced. If they do not agree with the verdict, they can appeal to the High Court." The two criminals still did not say a word, and were escorted to the detention center by bailiffs. When the verdict was announced, the wife of the principal offender, Lin Buwu, was also in the courtroom, holding a child who was not yet one year old. The child was ignorant and still smiled at people, opened his mouth and waved his hands, looking innocent. But Lin's wife did not show any emotional expression when she heard the verdict.

### Handling Enemy and Puppet Property - Liu Gongyun Reports on Work Progress - Received Materials Exceeding One Trillion Yuan

[Our Newspaper's Report] Mr. Liu Gongyun, Director of the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Region, held a second press conference at the bureau's conference room at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon. During the conference, he gave detailed reports on the general reception and handling of enemy and puppet property since its establishment. Mr. Liu first stated that the reception process was complex and multifaceted, and that it has now come to an end, but has not completely stopped.

According to the regulations of the Executive Yuan, the original inventory and the transfer inventory of various agencies should be consulted during the reception. However, because the bureau was established relatively late, the original reception inventories of the agencies that arrived earlier had either been lost or had omissions in the reception, making it difficult to verify the reception and inventory. Even the inventories that had been received had inconsistent content, with different product names, quantities, and units, making it necessary to carefully organize and verify them. As of recently, more than 2,600 inventories have been received. In addition, the Japanese Liaison Department was ordered to create a transfer inventory and compare it with the reception inventories of various agencies in detail. This work can be completed in the next week, and the exact amount of materials received will be clear. As for the leakage of materials, if it occurs after the reception, the bureau will bear full responsibility.

Received Materials

The total value of the received materials is of great concern to all parties. However, I am responsible for explaining today that it has already exceeded one trillion yuan, and the materials and traitorous properties outside of Shanghai, which are approximately one hundred billion yuan, are not included in this figure. Most of these materials are textiles, dyes, real estate, warehouses, docks, factories, gold, silver, cash, furniture, etc., and those received from the Japanese side account for approximately 50-60%, with the remainder being the property of puppet organizations and a small number seized by the investigation teams based on confidential reports.

Investigation Work

The investigation work is the most complained about and troublesome work for the bureau. The investigation teams have received a total of 6,800 confidential reports, and 2,500 cases have been accepted and seized. A portion is still being cleared. A portion of the funds of the informers have not yet been issued. In the future, reports of traitors' property will still be accepted and investigated jointly by the bureau and the court. As for the puppet properties, they were handled by the Military Statistics Bureau before the bureau arrived, and have now been gradually transferred to the bureau. The tally has been completed recently, totaling more than 270 cases. In addition, the bureau has seized a considerable number of cases based on confidential reports. Regarding the handling of traitors' property, the handling bureau and the court have agreed on cooperation methods, and are submitting them to the Executive Yuan for approval. As for the standard for deducting living expenses for the families of traitors whose property has been confiscated, the High Court is currently requesting instructions from the Judicial Administration Department. The department will have an interpretation of the laws on deducting living expenses in a short period of time, and the standard can be determined.

Handling of Auctions

The initial purpose of handling the auctions of enemy and puppet materials was to stabilize prices in the city. It achieved some results in the early stages. However, due to the small number of daily necessities in the received materials, the materials for sale gradually decreased. The prices in the city rose rapidly again due to other reasons. The bureau changed the flat sale method and entrusted various agencies, such as the China Textile Corporation for textiles and the Grain Administration for grain, to auction them separately. Although there were considerable achievements, it was not completely satisfactory. Moreover, as the national treasury needed funds, it was decided to open warehouses for large-scale sales, auctioning important materials and selling minor and scattered materials. A Committee for Auctioning Investigation Materials was formed to handle the materials seized by the investigation teams. A Committee for Auctioning Factory Materials will also be formed to be responsible for the auction of materials in the factories in order to increase government revenue and empty the warehouses. According to reports, half of the warehouses managed by the customs have been emptied. Most of these warehouses are privately owned and have been returned. They have been rented out by the China Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. As of today, materials worth 283 billion yuan have been auctioned, of which more than 100 billion yuan were sold in Shanghai, more than 20 billion yuan were gold, and more than 90 billion yuan were textiles, purchased by the Ministry of Military Affairs. Recently, the Executive Yuan stipulated that the bureau must increase the amount of money turned over to the national treasury by 200 billion yuan within six months to reach the amount of 500 billion yuan. If the city's credit is tight, auctions will be more difficult, so whether there is certainty is difficult to predict. The bureau will do its best to do it. In addition, the bureau has decided to adopt a low-price public method for auctioning materials or factories in the future, which will make auctions easier.

Review of Property Rights

The most troublesome matter in the bureau is the review of property rights. The Review Committee holds three meetings per week, and has held 103 meetings so far. What is discussed is the ownership of private property, with factories, houses, and ships accounting for the majority. The review process must be approved by the Executive Yuan in the end. Regarding property rights cases, the bureau has handled more than 2,000 cases belonging to factories and more than 4,900 cases belonging to houses, totaling more than 7,000 cases. If these cases are handled too loosely, outsiders will think there is corruption; if they are too strict, the owners will appeal to the Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan. Secondly, there is the evaluation part. The evaluation of all materials and factories, and the determination of the reward money for confidential reports, are all decided by the second group of the bureau. If the evaluation is too high, outsiders will not accept it; if it is too low, the government will suffer losses, so this work is also extremely heavy.

Sale of Factories

Eighty-six units of factories have been sold (all small factories). The government stipulates that all factories received, except for those allocated to the China Textile Corporation and the China [missing text], must be auctioned. However, the government has decided to allocate eight or nine of the factories to factories relocating from the rear. Afterwards, Mr. Liu answered reporters' questions: (1) The bureau had less than [missing text] before this year, but it does not have to wait until all the materials have been sold to close. The internal groups are actively downsizing. (2) The Reception and Review Team will arrive in Shanghai around the 20th of this month. The bureau will provide all [missing text] and original inventories for reference. (3) The Social Bureau Director [missing text] has discussed with me twice about labor-management and government-cooperative factories, requesting that two factories be allocated [missing text] from the received factories. The principle has not yet been determined. [Missing text] The sale of received houses is the government's original plan. The bureau has received more than 2,000 rounds of [missing text] houses, but every round is inhabited, and there are very few empty ones. It is now planned to start selling them in two weeks. The government has the greatest determination to order everyone living in the property to move out within a time limit when it is sold, guaranteeing that the buyer will not pay until the house is cleared. 300 buildings will be auctioned first, and the [missing text] size and low price of these 300 buildings will be announced in advance. Purchasers must apply to the Central Trust Bureau before publicly auctioning.

### Ye Jiqing Undergoes Second Trial - Claims to Have Interceded for Wu Kaixian, Helping Him Escape Danger - Wang Manyun Also Claims to Have Saved Wu

[Our Newspaper's Report] Ye Jiqing, wife of Li Shiqun, the chief of the puppet 76th Special Agent Headquarters, underwent a second trial at the High Court yesterday afternoon. Ye wore a Xiangyun gauze shirt and pants, barefoot in black soft leather flat shoes, and wore a bun, but her hair was already gray. According to her testimony: she was listed as an accountant at the "76th Headquarters", but had no salary or work. She only lived at the 76th Headquarters for a few months and then moved out, and did not interfere in special agent matters. As for serving as a member of the puppet Economic Committee, it was because Mrs. Chen Qun was humiliated on the road, and my husband had me listed on the Economic Committee to receive a pass, which made travel easier. Li Shiqun was the deputy director of the [missing text] headquarters, and the director was Ding Mocun. At that time, Wu Kaixian was arrested by the Japanese, and I interceded for him, so Li found a way to release him and return him to Chongqing. Li later died in September of the 32nd year because he repeatedly rescued underground workers and was dissatisfied by the Japanese. After the adjournment, Ye requested to meet with her daughter, and the judge granted her request. The case was adjourned for another hearing.

[Another Report] Wang Manyun, who held various puppet positions, was tried in High Court yesterday. Wang is 42 years old and from Hangzhou. In August of the 28th year, he served as a member of the puppet Central Executive Committee and Deputy Minister of the puppet Ministry of Social Affairs. In March of the 29th year, he transferred to the position of Vice Minister of the puppet Ministry of Agriculture and Mines. In July of the 30th year, he was transferred to the position of Deputy Secretary-General of the puppet Qingxiang Committee, specializing in suppressing my underground comrades. In September of the 31st year, he was reassigned as Vice Minister of the puppet Ministry of Judicial Administration. In the autumn of the 32nd year, he was transferred to the position of Director-General of the puppet Executive Yuan Qingxiang Affairs Bureau, responsible for suppressing anti-Japanese elements until the victory. However, Wang argued in court yesterday that: in the 31st year, Wu Kaixian was arrested in Shanghai, and he helped rescue him. He joined the puppet government under orders to cover for underground work. The case was adjourned for another hearing.

### Promoting the "Love Chinese Products" Movement Through Active Propaganda

Care should be taken during promotion to avoid confusion. Therefore, the "Love Chinese Products" Movement Committee has decided to adopt "Using Chinese Products is Most Glorious" as its sole slogan.

### National Standard Textbooks; Joint Printing and Sales

Aiming for Universal Supply

[Report from the Dahua News Agency] Since the National Standard Textbook Supply Office moved from Chongqing to Shanghai, it has requested the Housing Allocation Committee to allocate rental housing, but after a long time, there has been no result, which has greatly affected the work. Recently, the supply office was forced to spend a large sum of money to rent multiple houses in the Songbai Alley in Hongkou, actively speeding up the work for the autumn sales supply. In order to quickly adapt to the situation, the Shanghai Regional Distribution Committee was organized, with Li Bojia as the chairman, to be responsible for the autumn national standard textbook printing, storage, transportation, quantitative distribution, and contract negotiations with educational administrative agencies in Shanghai, Nanjing, Qingdao, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Henan, Fujian, Jiangxi, and other provinces and cities. Recently, due to a sharp increase in costs in the past six months, the selling prices of all books have been submitted to the Ministry of Education for approval and are being sold at 48 times the price. The office has organized supply groups in various regions and has decided to adopt joint printing and sales. The country is concentrating on six locations to jointly print, distribute quantitatively according to the educational statistics of each province and city (the Ministry of Education has recently made precise statistics, which are more reliable than the number of books requested by each educational agency), and jointly sell through the branch offices of each province and city using a pre-order method. If this method can be promoted with the cooperation of the educational departments of each province, it can reduce costs, the price of books, and avoid book shortages.

### Amateur and Professional Sports; Removing Boundaries

French Sports Organizations Urge Government Nationalization

[United Press, Paris, 12th] Various French sports organizations today requested the government to remove the boundaries between professional and amateur sports, which, in effect, would amount to nationalizing French sports. The resolution of the organizations advocates that French sports champions who are admired should be known as national athletes and supported by the state. It also requests that in national sports competitions, whether amateur or professional athletes, as well as coaches and instructors, should be allowed to participate. The distinction between amateur and professional originated in England, where amateur sports were generally favored by the privileged class, and those lacking financial resources were at a disadvantage. Obtaining the championship required rigorous training, and the ticket revenue from commercialized sports put amateur athletes at an unfair disadvantage.

### South China's Northern Expedition Becomes a Bubble; Qingbai Expresses Refusal to Play

In the Future, Revenue from Charity Football Matches Must Consult Their Distribution Methods

Regarding the China Welfare Fund Raising Committee's invitation to South China to come to Shanghai for a charity match, South China may have the possibility of going north, but due to the problem of the opposing team, it will likely fall through. As for the rumors that Qing and Dong teams intend to participate in the charity match, according to the person in charge of Qingbai authorities who firmly stated to the Huadong News Agency yesterday, the football season has passed, and most of the team members are not used to running in the hot sun. People are not cattle or horses, and cannot be forced, and some players are also leaving Shanghai. As for Li Chongshi, one of the Qingbai organizers, although he sympathizes with the charity match, Li cannot force the players to take the field either. He also said: According to what he knows, Donghua is also unable to participate in the charity match for the above reasons. It is also heard that Dong and Qing teams have recently indicated that in the future, when inviting the teams to participate in charity matches, they must explain the exact use of the revenue to the teams beforehand, and the two teams must consult on the distribution methods, otherwise, even during the season, the two teams will refuse to take the field.

Civil Affairs Brief Report

The Civil Affairs Department received instructions from the Municipal Government yesterday that, according to a report from the Municipal Police Bureau, it has been reported that in recent times, bandits and unscrupulous individuals in this city have often impersonated military police and falsely claimed to be investigating household registrations, breaking into residential homes and committing robberies, which should be effectively prevented to maintain public order.

It is heard that the department, after receiving the order, has instructed the district offices to comply.

### Baojia Chiefs Rescue Public Property

The Fourth District Office Requests the Municipal Government to Reward Them

At around 11:00 AM on the 27th of last month, the Relief Administration hired a lighter, carrying 290 bales of cotton, to sail into the Huangpu River. Due to the strong wind, it was unable to berth, causing it to capsize. Fortunately, Zhu Qiaosheng, chief of the 10th Jia of the 64th Bao (waterborne Bao) of the Fourth District, Lu Genyi, chief of the 17th Jia, Qiang Agen, chief of the 18th Jia, and Gao Zhengxing, chief of the 19th Jia, together with the boatmen on the shore, salvaged the cotton and returned it to the administration one by one without any loss.

The District Office has reported to the Social Affairs Bureau the names of twelve rice shops in the district, including Huang Ruitaifeng, for the allocation of low-priced rice.

### Questions and Answers

The Municipal Civil Affairs Department recently replied to a resident of Jiaotong University who inquired about the district office filling out the household license, which is based on the resident's household registration. The resident's household registration, except for the first investigation by government personnel, is usually based on the resident's application. Faculty and staff of your school should directly apply for entry registration with the Bao office in their place of residence, so that the district office can fill out the household license accordingly. The National Identity Card must also be filled out by the resident and the application form submitted to the Bao office for processing. As for blank application forms, you can inquire at the nearest district office or Bao office."

### Household Registration Implementation Details (Answers to Questions)

Q: What is identity registration? Since there is already origin registration, why is identity registration necessary?

A: Origin registration confirms a person's origin; identity registration certifies a person's status in private law. At the same time, the gain, loss, or change of identity may change one's origin. For example, acquiring the status of a spouse through marriage means the wife should take the husband's origin as her origin. Losing spousal status through divorce requires changing one's origin. Therefore, there is origin registration, and there must also be identity registration.

Q: How many types of identity registration are there?

A: There are eight types of identity registration:

(1) Birth registration – for children born and found abandoned children.
(2) Acknowledgment registration – acknowledging children born out of wedlock requires acknowledgment registration.
(3) Adoption registration – adopting other people's children requires adoption registration.
(4) Marriage registration – those who marry must register their marriage.
(5) Divorce registration – those who divorce must register their divorce.
(6) Death registration – death or declaration of death must be registered.
(7) Guardianship registration.
(8) Inheritance registration.

Q: For the six types above—birth, death or declaration of death, marriage, divorce, adoption, acknowledgment—on the one hand, it is necessary to apply for household registration or deregistration, and here it is also necessary to apply for identity registration. Isn't that two application procedures?

A: No, it's called one application, two registrations. Article 21, paragraph 2, of the Household Registration Implementation Rules stipulates: "If the same matter involves two or more registrations, two copies of the application form must still be filled out." Therefore, as long as you apply for various identity registrations, the registration agency can make household registration or deregistration based on this after receiving the identity registration.

The Thirty-Second District Office wrote to the Civil Affairs Department, asking: In the "address" column of the birth registration application form, does it refer to the address of the registration obligor, or the address of the person concerned? It is not clearly stipulated, so it is often confusing when filling it out. According to Article 39 of Chapter 6 of the amended Household Registration Law, "Children born in hospitals, prisons, or other public places, if their parents cannot apply for registration, the hospital director, prison warden, or other public place manager shall be the registration obligor." There are two questions: (1) If the column is the address of the person concerned, it will be impossible to find the registration obligor for inquiries in the future when questions arise regarding the registration. (2) If the column is the address of the registration obligor, the form will not be able to identify the location of the person concerned. Please provide an explanation.

Answer: (1) The address column under the name of the registration obligor on the birth registration application form refers to the address of the registration obligor. (2) Those who apply for birth registration other than parents, guardians, or cohabitants should indicate the address of the person concerned in the "Remarks" column for investigation purposes.

### Household Registration Implementation Details (9)

(Article 27) Changes, corrections, or cancellations of registration shall be recorded in the "Registered Items" column of the household registration book. If the paper is insufficient, the original column shall be labeled with a note and affixed with the name stamp of the household registration director.

The provisions of Article 25, paragraph 2, shall apply mutatis mutandis to those registered using cards.

Chapter 4 National Identity Card

(Article 28) Counties that issue national identity cards shall prepare them in a unified manner, send them to the township offices, and issue them on a regular basis after household registration.

When issuing national identity cards, the township offices shall assign numbers, complete the inspection and filling, submit them to the county government for review and stamping, and then return them to the township offices for distribution to the recipients.

Those who replace the national identity card with a household registration transcript shall be subject to the provisions of the national identity card mutatis mutandis.

### Domestic Production Costs Exceed Foreign Prices; The Inspector General of Customs Greatly Concerned; Not Enough Trade Development Customs Officers to Handle; Nothing Heard Regarding Adjustment of Tariffs

[Our Report] Our reporter recently visited Mr. Li Du, the Inspector General of Customs, and asked him several questions about customs matters, to which he graciously provided answers one by one. The main points are summarized below: (1) Regarding customs revenue matters, Mr. Li said that the situation is very good, with figures increasing rapidly month by month, exceeding the original expectations, but the exact figures could not be disclosed to the public. (2) Regarding rumors of adjusting import and export tariff rates, he declined to comment and said that he had not heard anything about it, stating that this was a matter for the Tariff Committee. (3) Regarding whether there would be any improvements in the current customs administrative measures, Mr. Li said that there are no special improvement measures that can be announced at present, but he pays close attention to customs administration and constantly seeks improvements. The most difficult thing recently is the shortage of customs personnel. On the one hand, Shanghai's foreign trade is expanding day by day, and the customs clearance procedures are also increasing day by day, so sometimes there are inevitable delays in handling matters. If it were not for the housing difficulties in this city, he would try his best to transfer customs officers from the interior to Shanghai in batches to alleviate the immediate needs. (4) After the victory, customs offices in various places have been restored one after another, from Qinhuangdao in the north to Dihua in the west, and Haikou in the south. There are already 40 customs offices established across the country. Among them, the newly established ones include Tainan, Taipei, and Guangzhou Bay. There are several customs offices in the interior, such as Suzhou, Hangzhou, and Zhou, which have recently been considered for closure because the government has abolished the inland transit tax. Other places such as Yantai, Weihaiwei, Longkou in Shandong, and Harbin, Hunchun, Andong, Dalian, and Fanyang in the Northeast cannot restore customs offices due to the special circumstances in those places, but the customs has been fully prepared and is ready to station and rehabilitate them at any time when the situation permits. (5) At the end, Mr. Li spoke about the current imbalance of imports and exports in our country and hoped that it could be adjusted as soon as possible. Mr. Li said that the international market has a strong demand for our country's products, but the domestic labor and raw material costs are too high, and transportation is not smooth, resulting in expensive prices that cannot meet the foreign price levels. He hopes that the points of stagnation can be improved to the best of his ability.

### Gold Prices Stable, U.S. Dollar Continues to Fall; Hong Kong Notes Rise Another Ten Yuan Compared to Previous Closing

Yesterday's ingot was stable and strong, opening with a good start in the morning. The U.S. dollar continued to weaken, and there was a flow of profit-taking at high prices, gradually declining. After ten o'clock, the central bank distributed 90 bars at a price of 1.95 million, with the lowest price falling to 1.945 million. After that, the demand for supply was slack, and it continued to struggle around 1.95 million yuan until noon. After that, it continued to be stable, rising to over 1.96 million, resulting in an increase of 12,000 compared to the previous day. Decorative gold rose, while standard silver and silver dollars were flat. The unofficial credit was still loose, and the interest rate was around 15%.

Foreign currencies were still suppressed by profit-taking, unable to rally. Initially, there were sellers at 2,580 yuan, gradually declining without any special changes. By noon, it had fallen below 2,540 yuan. In the afternoon, the gold market was slightly stronger, with a slight increase, resulting in a decrease of 15 yuan compared to the previous closing. Hong Kong notes rose to over 560 yuan before leveling off slightly, resulting in another increase of 10 yuan. Hong Kong exchange rates were constrained by the immobile interbank rate, rising slightly to around 550 yuan. Indian exchange rates were 670 yuan, and British exchange rates were 9,000 yuan, both lacking buyers. U.S. exchange rates remained flat.

### Scarce Public Debt Trading

Public debt transactions have suddenly become sparse again, leading to a lack of support. The "Bing" series, since opening at 810 yuan, has consistently seen more supply than demand. Midday trading fell to 660 yuan before short covering provided support and the market rebounded somewhat. Ultimately, it closed 180 yuan lower than the previous close. Series "Jia" and "Yi" fell 50 yuan, "Ding" fell 130 yuan, and "Wu" fell 190 yuan. Price differences have thus converged.

### Easy Monetary Conditions; Chinese Shares Rebound

Chinese shares are rebounding due to easier monetary conditions, which are being used to boost large-cap stocks. Small-cap stocks are still struggling to recover. At the morning's lowest points, Wing On Spinning was at 475 yuan, Mei Ah at 2770 yuan, King Fook at 165 yuan, Sun Kwong at 183 yuan, and Chun Hing at 145 yuan. Prices rose near midday. Buying interest in less active small- and mid-cap stocks was strong, and the upward trend is just beginning, making supply difficult to obtain. Compared to the previous close, Wing On Spinning, Mei Ah, King Fook, and Sun Kwong all showed slight gains. Chun Hing remained flat. Among the less active small- and mid-cap stocks, only Sino-French Underwear rose by half a percentage point; the rest also saw slight increases. The veteran blue-chip stocks continued to make slight progress. The panic atmosphere in foreign stocks has not yet dissipated, with operators mostly on the sidelines. After a weak opening, the recovery of Chinese shares provided some stimulus. Ewo Silk was able to rebound from 7200 yuan to 7650 yuan. Ultimately, Ewo Silk, British & Chinese Corporation, and Kwong Yick Hong saw slight declines, while Ewo Brewery, China Paper, and Jardine Matheson saw slight increases.

### White Tung Oil, Hankow Telegram Falls

White tung oil prices had risen in the past two weeks due to domestic sales activity, but a lack of export demand limited the gains. The market has now stabilized after the slight rise. With another telegram from Hankow reporting a slight decline, the general market price is around 57,000 yuan per picul, causing a similar weakness in the local market. Relying solely on domestic sales is unlikely to be sustainable. Local traders are also loosening their selling prices slightly, generally around 76,000 yuan. However, Hongjiang tung oil is relatively stable due to peak summer sales, with West Deputy brand oils around 80,000 yuan, and local Hong oil at 70,000 to 67,000 or 68,000 yuan.

### Central Sand White Spot

Yesterday's sugar market was tight due to it being a Saturday and spot goods being scarce. The Association's quoted spot price for 20th grade central sand white sugar initially started at 95,000 yuan, then 4500 yuan and 4000 yuan. It then turned tight, rising to 67,000 yuan, up 3000 yuan from the previous day. Wenzhou central sand white sugar, due to being double-wrapped, was only 85,000 yuan, while warehouse receipts were 94,000 yuan, up 3000 to 4000 yuan. Semi-refined white sugar was 140,000 yuan. Chaozhou merchants were offering delivery certificates for 81,000 to 82,000 yuan for grade A, and 79,000 to 80,500 yuan for Huang Wanqing, also slightly tight. Xinghua merchants were offering ordinary red sugar at 95,000 to 97,000 yuan, and second-grade white sugar at 100,000 yuan. Jian merchants were offering grade A at 78,000 yuan. Total transactions amounted to approximately 300 lots.

### Taiwan Black Tea Hot

Export tea is extremely dull. After repeated consultations by Jardine Matheson & Co., the Keemun aged black tea issue was finally resolved. However, market sentiment is very weak. As for domestic mixed teas, supply and demand are balanced. However, demand for new Shaoxing fried tea and Taiwan black tea from Suzhou merchants has suddenly strengthened, boosting morale and driving prices up. As a result, prices rose by 7,000 to 8,000 yuan per picul compared to the previous day.

### Rediscount Measures; Executive Yuan Has Not Yet Approved

There is general expectation for the Central Bank to implement rediscounting. It has been learned that the Central Bank has drafted measures and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for approval. Once approved, they will be implemented. According to Deputy Director Gao of the Military Finance Inspection Office, very few commercial banks are currently investing in factories, which often hinders industrial production. Rediscounting can alleviate the difficulties faced by factories. However, the resulting increase in market credit may stimulate inflation, which must be addressed in advance. This issue requires careful consideration and is related to the measures of both the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Finance. Therefore, the implementation measures must be submitted for approval.

### Ramie Soars

Hemp was originally intended for export, but due to high prices after the war, export trade has not been very active. Although goods from various production areas arrived in Shanghai this spring, the market remained stagnant due to sluggish sales, hovering between 60,000 and 70,000 yuan for several months. Recently, due to the activation of domestic sales, mainly for weaving summer cloth, the market has suddenly soared. The current highest price for high-grade bundled hemp is around 100,000 yuan per picul, while Yuanjiang hemp is also at 90,000 yuan.

### Swedish Currency Revaluation

English and American Currencies Lowered by 14 Percent

[Reuters, Stockholm, 13th] The Swedish National Bank announced last night that it was reducing the statutory parities of the pound sterling and the US dollar against the Swedish krona. Effective from the 13th, one US dollar is worth SEK 3.60 (previously SEK 4.20), while one pound sterling is worth SEK 24.5 (previously SEK 16.92). The dollar and pound values are approximately 14 percent lower.

### The National Bank's Business; Not Yet Fully Specialized; Remarks by Manager Li of the Bank of Communications

[Our Reporter] Mr. Li Daonan, manager of the Bank of Communications, recently expressed his opinion on the specialization of national banks, saying that the specialization of banks is still in its early stages. Generally, all banks engage in common banking businesses, such as facilitating domestic and foreign trade finance, and ordinary deposits and loans. Each national bank focuses on different areas. The Bank of China focuses on handling foreign exchange. The Bank of Communications focuses on developing industries. The Farmers Bank of China focuses on agricultural loans. The Central Trust Bureau focuses on procuring materials for the state and operating warehousing businesses, as well as providing loans for cultural undertakings. The Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau focuses on lending for public utilities. The division of business boundaries can only be described as focusing on different areas, rather than pure specialization. For example, the Bank of Communications provides loans of 100 million yuan, with 50% specifically for industrial and commercial enterprises, and the rest allocated to commerce and other sectors, showing that the business has indeed focused on industrial development, while still taking into account sectors outside the industrial sphere that require loan assistance. The same is true for other banks. In the future, we should follow national policies and gradually move towards specialization based on social conditions and the needs of the economic environment.

### Diverging Yarn and Cotton Markets

Yesterday's yarn market was extremely ordinary. Sales of large-sized yarn were weak, with prices falling by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Medium-sized yarn lacked the strength to rise. Small-sized yarn was being purchased by customers from Nanjing, Wuhu, and other places, so prices remained stable. Other counts were also very ordinary. Overall trading volume was low, and morale was temporarily neutral, with the future seemingly entering a consolidation phase.

Yesterday's New York cotton futures telex showed gains of 23 to 29 points. Nearby was at US$34.03, distant at US$34.39, and the Middling spot price was US$34.85. Spot cotton trading in the local market was still good. Shen Hsin No. 1 Factory and Nantong Dasheng, Wuxi Zhenxin, and Dahua and other private cotton mills were all purchasing. Market prices continued to rise by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, following US cotton.

### American Silk Price at $8.50; Manufacturers Still Think It's Too High; Hope to Return to Pre-War Standards

[Reuters, New York, 13th] Silk traders here are firmly of the view that raw silk prices should be reduced. They believe that the current level of $10 per pound should be lowered to $6 per pound by the end of 1946. Before the war, silk prices were $3 to $4 per pound. It is reported that traders have rejected recent sales of Italian raw silk below $10. The State Department has recently set a minimum selling price of $8.50 for 5,000 bales of Japanese raw silk that were recently sold, but manufacturers believe this price is too high. They believe that natural silk will compete with rayon in the future, so prices must be lowered.

### January to April; Customs Import and Export Ship Table

[Our Reporter] According to Customs news: Between January and April of this year, the number of ships and their tonnage entering and exiting Shanghai for international trade were as follows:

### Costs Will Be Vigorously Reduced; Japanese Silk Is Still a Major Competitor; Annual Production to Increase to 150,000 Bales

[Reuters, New York, 13th] Mr. D, President of the US Testing Company, the person in charge of inspecting imported silk, recently discussed the future of the Japanese silk industry in the Commercial News, saying: Japan's production in 1945 was 85% lower compared to 1940, while silk reeling capacity was 91% lower. However, Japan still has a stockpile of 50,000 bales reeled during 1940-1942 ready for export, plus 120,000 bales that can be reeled in 1946, bringing the total to 170,000 bales. 120,000 bales can be exported, 130,000 bales will be available for export in 1947, and 150,000 bales may be available in 1948. Currently, silkworm farming has become a major agricultural issue in Japan. Mulberry trees are being cultivated extensively in poor and remote areas unsuitable for other crops. The silkworm farming work is being done by the elderly, weak, women and children who are not suitable for heavy field work. The female workers employed in silk reeling factories are the daughters of rural families, and their parents sign work contracts with the factories. Furthermore, all factories are located far inland, isolated from major industrial cities. Therefore, in the future of the Japanese economy, no industry can replace the silk industry. Mr. D believes that Japan will use its talents to produce silk manufacturers to compete with rayon. However, during the reconstruction period, Japan will face competitive pressure and gradually reduce its production costs so that the final price of silk exported to the United States, except perhaps for a short period, will be at the lowest possible level. Italy and Chinese natural silk are also attempting to compete in the US market. The number of Italian silk arrivals is quite considerable, while Chinese silk initially appeared active but has recently shown signs of loosening.

### Passenger and Cargo Transport to Shanghai Gradually Increasing; Rice Market Transactions Becoming Clearer; Rice Weevils Moving to Nanxiang

The rice market trend has been gradually stabilizing in recent days. The source of passengers and cargo has increased sharply, and various grades are gradually softening. Due to profit opportunities, merchants are working diligently to transport rice, and the amount of rice transported to Shanghai has increased by about half compared to half a month ago. It is heard that a large amount of rice is being collected by merchants in the production area, preparing for shipment. Currently, all rice stores in the city have resumed selling rice, but the most common is second-grade indica rice, and high-quality japonica rice is in short supply. The Social Affairs Bureau is paying close attention to this point. Yesterday, the registration volume of passengers and cargo at the Nanshi market was 1,412 piculs, at the Beishi market it was 1,523 piculs and 4.5 dou. Rice stores were transporting and selling 820 piculs on their own. Flour remained flat. Bran softened. Wheat prices were high in the production areas, and sellers were firm, with prices rising by 300 to 400 yuan. Soybeans also increased by 500 to 600 yuan due to active cake making. Soybean cake continued to rise by 300 to 400 yuan. Raw peanuts were scarce, and prices rose again by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. The oil market was stable.

Also, recently, some unscrupulous merchants in Shanghai, due to strict food control in Shanghai, have been moving their operations to Nanxiang, causing rice prices in Nanxiang to be higher than in Shanghai. There is a trend of rice being transported to Shanghai being redirected to Nanxiang. The municipal authorities are now paying close attention to this, and the mayor has appointed Section Chief Ji to personally inspect Nanxiang yesterday morning, to strictly crack down on this unhealthy trend.

### The United States Welcomes Menthol; Inventory Estimated at 200,000 Pounds

[Reuters, New York, 13th] A recent shipment of menthol arriving here from China, a total of 50 boxes, is of excellent quality and can be called the best. It is estimated that China currently has about 200,000 pounds of menthol. The ideas held by traders here are very different from each other, but they may be coordinated quickly when Chinese goods can start to compete fiercely with Brazil. It is reported that the price of the menthol has already increased.

### HSBC Bank Annual Meeting; Overview of China's Economic Situation; Paying Close Attention to Sterling Bonds

[Reuters, Hong Kong, 13th] Mr. Morse, Chairman and General Manager of HSBC Bank, in the first annual meeting after the war, mentioned the situation in China, praising President Chiang Kai-shek's leadership in resisting Japan and ultimately winning the final victory. Regarding the economy, Mr. Morse said that the famine and inflation in China are still very serious. The amount of paper money issued is unclear, and the government does not publish figures on the state of receipts and expenditures. The practice of tax evasion has not been eliminated, and prices continue to rise. Although the official exchange rate of legal tender to the US dollar is 2020 to 1, the Chinese government refuses to determine the exchange rate of the pound sterling based on the London and New York telex rates, so the black market is very inconsistent. He also mentioned China's foreign debt, stating that the total amount of sterling foreign debt is no more than £60,000,000, while the foreign debt in other currencies may reach £75,000,000. Therefore, sterling bondholders naturally hope that the government can resume repayment, because the smaller amount of foreign debt is guaranteed by the Chinese government.

### Hong Kong Pawnshops Strike

[Reuters, Hong Kong, 12th] The police ordered all pawnshops to restore the interest rates of 1930. The pawnshops believe that it is difficult to comply, so they are going on strike. There are 77 pawnshops in the Kowloon area. They have stopped pawning items, but redemption and renewal are not affected. During the Japanese occupation, the pawnshops stipulated a maturity of 15 to 30 days, with a monthly interest rate of about 10%.

### The Eighth Air Force Group, Trip to Tokyo (3)

— Zhu Minwei

As a reporter, while on the 30-mile road in Tokyo, Japan, I not only admired the Japanese Kamikaze Air Force, but also saw the array of American military trucks, jeeps, and tanks parked on the vacant field by the roadside near Yokohama (these things, like garbage, have been parked in the open space 20 feet from the road since the US military landed in Tokyo Bay last year. These things have now become completely worthless, but they symbolize the reason why the owner was able to subdue Japan. These numerous things, forming an almost military ocean, are worth watching with wide eyes in the eyes of someone from an empty country. But here, they are just a pile of junk. The Americans use them as a symbol of their rule without moving them. Just like the four million citizens of Shanghai saw the array of tanks of the Japanese military headquarters at the end of North Sichuan Road in those years. Because they knew that flesh and blood could not stop the crushing of iron tracks.

After we entered the Yokohama urban area, the scene of the destruction of the Japanese mainland and the structure of Japanese capitalism appeared simultaneously. Although Yokohama and Tokyo are two cities, they are actually like Shanghai and the Jiangwan New City district that is about to be built. They have merged into one. Yokohama, with its harbor, dockyards, piers, warehouses, and cranes, serves as Tokyo's port of entry and exit, while Tokyo serves as Yokohama's inner chamber, restaurant, and bath, relying on each other. The roads we drove on were wide, flat, and clean. The density of streetcar tracks on the road and the overhead tram cables is the crystallization of 40 years of Japanese material progress. The great bombings destroyed six-tenths of the houses in Yokohama and Tokyo, but did not destroy the transportation systems and road administration of these two cities. On this point alone, Tokyo and Yokohama are better than Shanghai. And besides, there are many cities like Tokyo and Yokohama in Japan.

### MacArthur is a Savior, Healing the Japanese

The reason why MacArthur distributed so few occupation troops militarily is that MacArthur has achieved great success politically and does not need to use a large number of troops. By granting Japan some superficial sovereignty, for example: the Emperor is still the highest political power in Japan. The House of Representatives of the Japanese government is composed of parties with democratic tendencies, but the cabinet is usually led by leaders of moderate parties, implementing the decisions of MacArthur's headquarters. The regulatory effect that MacArthur urgently wants to achieve at present is not to promote the prestige of the occupying country or to satisfy the occupying country's needs, but to seek stability for the 70 million people on this land based on the minimum living requirements of the Japanese people. Therefore, a Japanese publication drew MacArthur bandaging the wounds of the injured Japanese. MacArthur's true intention is also to hope that the Japanese can be reassigned to labor tasks after their wounds heal.

Based on this, we can understand why MacArthur allows Japanese fishing boats to go to the surrounding oceans to fish. The 40 ships going to the China Sea are only a small number of the thousands of fishing boats that Japan is allowed to send to the outer oceans. We can also understand why MacArthur wants the countries of the occupying army to transport grain by ship to supply the occupying army stationed in Japan, instead of purchasing it locally in famine-stricken Japan. We can understand why American newspapers and Japanese newspapers in Tokyo specifically highlighted the news that the headquarters had transported flour from the United States to Japan in large characters.

Although MacArthur has given Japan various supplies in terms of economy, the Japanese food problem this year and in the future is still a major issue. 70 million Japanese live on these four islands. Due to the narrow land and too little arable land, it is impossible to meet their food needs. Therefore, in the past few decades, Japan has always exchanged industrial products for rice from Malaysia, Vietnam, and Siam. The rice production of Korea and Taiwan was unconditionally supplied to the Japanese mainland. Now, Japanese prisoners and Japanese nationals are being repatriated to the mainland from all over the world, the source of food has disappeared, and there are many people who need food. The Japanese food problem is ultimately the most serious problem for Japan in the future.

MacArthur's second method is to maintain Japanese light industry so that it can exchange surplus products for food. The 2,570,000 spindles, 100,000 looms, and 130,000 rayon spindles that have started production are all working hard to exchange for foreign food for Japan. Those who are clear about the situation in South America and Southeast Asia should know that these two regions can export food. MacArthur's use of Japan's existing three million tons of ships is enough to maintain Japan's needs for exporting yarn and silk and importing food.

The Japanese now know that they cannot be autonomous, because in this war, they caused too much trouble. After surrendering, they only seek to survive. All early propositions and arguments have been abandoned. MacArthur's rule of Japan seems to be aimed only at obtaining an obedient follower of the United States, so he focuses on economic supplies to heal Japan's post-war wounds, politically makes any Japanese cabinet implement headquarters decisions, and militarily uses symbolic methods to make Japan understand that resistance and sabotage are useless, and bow to accept the implementation of all terms. The end is to psychologically make Japan gradually awaken from the contempt for the United States and the exaggerated Japanese strength to friendliness and admiration for the United States. Therefore, after MacArthur occupied Japan, except for arresting Japanese war criminals to complete the psychological warfare purpose, the US military did not arrest or mistakenly arrest a single Japanese person. The impression that the US military gave the Japanese was that they were innocent, lively, cheerful, handsome, and polite, and did not infringe on the civilians at all. The good reactions of the Japanese to the US military that I saw in any place can prove that this impression is not wrong.

This psychological effect of doing many righteous things is actually the application of the principle that we Chinese have had many examples of since the Warring States period. But it seems that because our own affairs are messy, we have no time to care about the outside world. The United States, with a year of youthful national vitality, can use the ancient magic of inviting good people.

What is the purpose of doing many righteous things? Today, when we look at the uncoordinated arrangement of the world, we can always know that, therefore, the cunning Japanese are secretly happy in their hearts. When they can still exert their strength in their lives, another era of Japanese turnaround will always come. Therefore, the lower-level Japanese are sincerely obedient, the upper-level Japanese have been imprisoned or died, and a small part of the middle-level Japanese are waiting for a great era to turn around. Their dream, in my opinion, will not succeed, because the American governing experts have a deep memory of the Pearl Harbor lessons and the three years of disastrous defeat in the Pacific. The 25-year plan to control Japan is the best way to erase the resurgence of a strong group on the earth by "a long period of years." After 25 years, the Japanese middle-level figures who are secretly happy today will all be old or materialized. Japanese children in their teens have been educated and influenced by pro-American education. After 25 years, they will be in power. No one can imagine that the dissatisfied 100 million Japanese on those four islands at that time will have the power to be autonomous and resist the United States, which has a population of nearly 200 million (the population of the United States after 25 years). Besides, the United States not only seeks friendship in Japan, but also universally seeks good people in any land on the earth.

### The Far East International Tribunal: A Stage for Psychological Warfare

The Far East International Tribunal, with American Judge Webb as its chief, is truly a well-directed play by the American Psychological Warfare Department. The court convenes almost daily at the former Japanese Army Ministry Military Tribunal. On June 21st, Mr. Ruan Weixin, the director of the Chinese delegation, said he would accompany us to observe the trial of the 28 war criminals, including Tojo. Early in the morning of the 24th, Adjutant Qian Mingnian drove us to the hearing. I sat in the stuffy air upstairs for an hour and felt like I couldn't breathe. Exiting and watching at the gate, American military police were playfully slapping each other on the silent guard post, chatting with a British driver.

The eleven judges are truly representatives of eleven countries that were wronged and harmed by Japanese aggression since the "September 18th Incident" (China, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, France, Australia, Canada, India, the Netherlands, the Philippines, and New Zealand). However, because the grand production of the future world's human history must have substance, they are too embarrassed to simply shout "Give me back my head!" and chop off the heads of the Japanese war criminals. Therefore, judges and prosecutors were selected to form the Far East Tribunal, and Tojo and the other 28 Japanese people who should be held responsible for returning their heads were subjected to exhausting interrogations time and time again (already more than fifty times). Especially in this hot weather, the judges and war criminals in the Far East Tribunal are all wearing thick clothes during each trial, and the room is crowded and stuffy. Only the American military police with white helmets have cold light radiating from their green eyes. The eleven judges seem to be enjoying it tirelessly, and every member of the occupying forces who comes to Japan seems to consider seeing Tojo's true face as a major accomplishment. After receiving visitor passes, they squeeze into the ordinary seats upstairs or the VIP seats downstairs to sweat and listen. I really think this is just a piece of psychological warfare drama.

On the evening of June 20th, I entered the Tokyo district, and on the morning of June 25th, I left Tokyo for Atsugi Airport. I only stayed in Tokyo for a little over four days, one of which was spent touring the scenic area of Atami, a hundred miles away. I was actually in Tokyo for three days, and my experiences were limited. I plan to record them in several sections. First, I must talk about the part of the American rule in Japan.

The MacArthur Headquarters in Tokyo, facing the Japanese Imperial Palace from afar, appears on the surface to be a purely military headquarters, and its representative, General MacArthur, seems to be a pure military man. However, in reality, it is a group of various American experts. These experts are not famous, but in fact, every order and decision of MacArthur is the result of the research of these experts on specialized issues or their responsible departments. These experts do not allow their "specialized" or "biased" views to hinder the overall American policy towards Japan. On the contrary, the common and comprehensive opinions of these experts constitute the content of the American policy towards Japan.

The United States' offer of surrender to Japan, although intended to reduce casualties on its own side and to reduce casualties on the Japanese side, was mainly motivated by the desire to bring the people, land, and resources of Japan into the sphere of obedience to the will of the United Nations. If Japan had been invaded, the postwar occupation of Japan would have inevitably led to dock destruction, port destruction, transportation system destruction, and hatred and hostile actions of the Japanese people towards the Allied occupation. That situation would have been even worse than the reaction Japan received from invading and occupying China. Therefore, when Japan decided to surrender, seeking only to preserve the Emperor system, the United States quickly accepted this condition and took on the task of accepting Japan's surrender.

The initial occupying forces in Japan consisted of only 200,000 American soldiers. Except for the Kuril Islands north of Hokkaido, which were first occupied by Soviet forces, all four major islands of Japan were occupied by American forces. Until this year, British, Canadian, Australian, New Zealand, Dutch, and Philippine forces appeared in Japan in small numbers. MacArthur Headquarters stipulates that the total number of Allied forces should not exceed 0.4% of the Japanese population, that is, one Allied occupying soldier for every 250 Japanese people. In reality, there are only 170,000 Allied soldiers stationed on the Japanese mainland, and the ratio of Allied soldiers to the Japanese population is 1 to 411, which is still within the prescribed "point" and does not constitute a "line," let alone a "surface" occupation.

As we passed a steel bridge, a white-painted sign with red characters faced us, which read: "Now you have arrived in Tokyo!" This is a sentence with profound meaning. This sentence includes many tragic and joyful stories. Under this sentence, Americans died the most, and Chinese died even more than Americans. I thought of the scene of the United Nations forces entering Tokyo from this bridgehead last September, and the meaning of this sentence became even more profound!

Looking at the broken walls and rubble in the Tokyo city area, we realized that the bombing of Chongqing, Sichuan, was insignificant. Our car stopped at the Imperial Bank Yurakukan in Ginza Yurakucho. Although the night in Tokyo was mysteriously attractive, we hid on the fourth floor and silently pondered the events of the day.

I thought that most plane crashes are caused by clouds blocking the ground, and encountering hills higher than the ground and obscured by clouds during landing. Although Shanghai has no mountainous terrain, the cloud height during takeoff is less than 300 feet, which is very dangerous if landing. Fortunately, the plane was in good condition, and the weather in Tokyo was clear when my plane arrived, so the plane took off according to the scheduled time without hesitation.

We lay in the rooms of the American lieutenant's guest house, listening to the low-pitched conversations of the American officers, and fell asleep without realizing it.

### Touring Atami

On June 23rd, Captain Luo Linbao and Lieutenant Yan Zhiliang, Chinese officers stationed in Japan, accompanied me and Huang Eryi, Chen Gongmao, and others on an excursion to Atami Onsen. After a two-and-a-half-hour train ride, I felt that the Japanese transportation system was undamaged and deeply rooted. There were more than twenty mountain tunnels along the way, one of which was about five minutes long, more than twice as long as the Zhenjiang tunnel on the Beijing-Shanghai Line.

Atami is located on the shore of Sagami Bay, about 100 kilometers southwest of Tokyo, at the foot of Mount Hakone, a branch of Mount Fuji. The hot springs gushing out, the small town city, leaning against the mountains and facing the sea, the scenery is excellent, making it a popular suburban resort for Tokyo residents for summer sea bathing and winter hot spring bathing. This small town city has not been disturbed by the war at all. The storefronts in the streets are more beautiful than those in Tokyo, but the prices of the items sold are also very expensive. There is nothing else besides food, toys, and daily necessities. Two black American soldiers bought a painting called "Floating Boat" for their Japanese female companions in a bead shop.

Touring the seaside bathing beach, watching the green boats floating on the sea, Japanese men, women, adults and children swimming in the water, the scene is really moving. I didn't bring swimming clothes, so I just acted as an observer. I feel that the Japanese live on an island, and the sunlight, seawater, and the beautiful scenery of the island can cultivate this nation. Every citizen becomes a healthy member. If they don't dream of dominating the world and other races, other countries are willing to cooperate with them and supply them with the food they lack. This island nation specializing in technological development could easily become the modern-day shadow of the ancient Greek nation in the East.

We had a meal at the Heian Chinese Restaurant, climbed to the fourth floor to see the panoramic view of Atami Bay, and listened to the sound of the tide lapping against the shore in the twilight. I thought that if this wonderful travel opportunity had not been approved by General Zhou Zhirou, I would not have had it. Although the travel of a few days was in a hurry, the scenery and objects of Japan were always presented before my eyes like a mirage. If I have the opportunity in the future, I would like to live in this country often.

At 9 pm, I and Brother Chen Gongmao and others took the last train back to Tokyo. We were not sitting in the velvet Allied special car but in the tail-end military car full of goods, among which there were dozens of chicks chirping and singing, which aroused an old American soldier's idea. He said:

"I really want to raise such a group of chicks in my home, but I still have five months before I can go back. This regulation really makes me depressed."

We told him that we also wanted to return to our hometown to raise chickens, and did not want to be a foreign soldier outside, but we kept secret about the fact that we were about to return home, fearing that he would take out the wine bottle in his bag and pour it down again because of this.

### Weekday Forum: On the So-Called "Financial Turmoil"

— Xie Kangsha

For the past two weeks, the Shanghai market first saw a sharp drop in public bonds, several speculative firms went bankrupt, and some speculative friends fled, involving employees of several banks. This was followed by the liquidation of Daya Bank, coinciding with the "end of June" settlement and the transfer of large amounts of cigarette tax revenue to the national treasury, tying up a portion of funds and leading to a tightening of credit. After the opening of the customs earlier this month, the situation remained the same. A few banks and firms were unable to make up for the exchange differences as early as possible, which caused a delay in smoothing things out, thus causing many rumors. Newspapers reported this and exaggerated the situation, publishing news that certain banks and firms had suspended business, causing widespread panic. In fact, daily exchange of notes among banks and firms, whether the difference is large or small, is common. In today's absence of a joint reserve institution, those who are temporarily short of funds must seek funds from all sides, especially when everyone is tightening lending. There is nothing surprising about this. To conclude that the entire financial industry is experiencing "turmoil" is an exaggeration. This situation is just like when a four-foot-long green snake appeared on Guangxi Road some time ago, and the newspapers deliberately exaggerated it as "a giant python has appeared," which is as ridiculous!

Of course, the blow suffered by some speculators in the past two weeks cannot be said to be insignificant. But this is unrelated to the entire financial industry. Because everyone has long known that the public bond trading on the black market is out of the ordinary, and the general financial industry and prudent speculators have regarded it as a snake, not paying attention to it. This is in contrast to the days of the pre-war Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, where a few consecutive drops in public bonds would shake the entire market. Currently, it can be said that public bonds have almost no impact on the financial industry. The manipulators first fabricated the false news that customs gold would be returned, raising the price of a hundred-yuan ticket to over two thousand yuan. The government already had rumors at the time, but they still went further, falsely claiming that "Sun banknotes" would be returned, even saying that a ten-thousand-yuan ticket could be exchanged for ten taels of gold, and forcibly raised the market price to over eight thousand yuan. Originally, who would be fooled by such absurd rumors, except for foolish friends who were blinded by profit and lambs waiting to be slaughtered? Therefore, this time the market price has fallen sharply. Although the amount of losses suffered by speculators is quite alarming, the scope of the impact is not widespread. However, they are accustomed to using fraudulent methods to defraud stocks and cash from various sources to make up for their discounts, causing many people to be implicated. Because of the fall in public bonds, they then cut stocks to make contributions, so the stock market price also fell sharply. At this time, the secured creditors rushed to redeem and shrink their loans, so the stock market became smaller and smaller, and the credit in the speculative market became tighter and tighter. A series of embezzlement cases by employees of firms and banks were exposed. As a result, Daya Bank was forced to close, and the news spread, so the market could not avoid turbulence.

Facts tell us that the funds used by Shanghai speculators in the past six months have come entirely from the speculative market. Because the interest rate for savings in the banking industry is low, and the hidden interest rate outside is high, many wealthy friends have directly or indirectly lent funds in the market to earn interest. Therefore, the fluctuations in the speculative market have no connection with the financial industry. But in the end, it will inevitably be implicated. The reason is very simple. Originally, the market is a whole and cannot be separated. "Pull one hair and move the whole body" is a fitting description of this situation. However, as far as the entire financial industry in Shanghai is concerned, they have experienced many hardships and seen many changes. With their long history and experience, they don't regard these small waves as anything at all. Although some newspapers are exaggerating the financial tension, the staff in the banking and money industries associations are always quiet and leisurely, which shows the truth about the so-called "turmoil."

The Chinese secret to success is "Everyone sweeps the snow in front of their own door, and doesn't care about the frost on other people's tiles." In the past, when the economic organization was simple, one could take care of oneself. But in today's complex economic organization, if the financial industry continues to adhere to the old rules and watch the fire from across the river, it may eventually spread to itself. Recently, everyone in the industry has tightened credit and stopped lending, and checks are not allowed to be used on the same day. This is commendable in terms of business policy. But if Company A does this, Company B will follow suit, and Company C and D will follow suit. As a result, the clearing house will return bills worth one or two hundred billion, which will cause many unnecessary rumors. This measure seems to be worth studying.

In times of financial turmoil, the most important thing is to stabilize people's minds and eliminate rumors. Otherwise, unfounded rumors will spread more and more widely, and depositors' psychology will panic, causing them to rush to withdraw their deposits. At this time, if the response is not handled properly, it will really cause a disaster. The financial industry's main business is to provide and receive credit. However, any loans issued by banks and firms cannot be recovered in a short period of time, and currently 95% of deposits are floating in nature, which can easily be withdrawn in full within half a day. Even banks and firms with good credit and sufficient reserves will be helpless in this situation. During the American financial panic in the past, a well-known bank stood firm. However, one day, because the clock in the bank was inaccurate, the opening of the gate in the morning was delayed by a few minutes, which immediately triggered rumors that the bank was closed. One spread to ten, and ten spread to a hundred. When the gate opened, countless depositors poured in, and the cash was withdrawn in an instant, making it impossible to turn around, and the bank was forced to close. This was truly an unwarranted disaster, but it also shows the significant impact of rumors on public psychology in times of market turmoil. Therefore, it is not the best way for each bank and firm to hold its ground.

Not only that, but the economic illness of Shanghai is getting more and more serious every day. Factories are breathing their last breath because of high costs and the inability to compete with foreign goods. Shops are eating their way to ruin due to high expenses and sluggish business. The heavy burden of interest is the fatal wound of all industries. If industry and commerce do not hurry to open up a new path, the future will be in danger. The situation of the financial industry may be a hundred times more serious than the consequences of the recent collapse of the bond market. "Treading on thin ice leads to danger," and I deeply hope that the entire financial industry in the city will prepare as soon as possible.

It has been almost a year since the victory, and Shanghai's financial industry still lacks an institution to maintain collective security, which is a great regret. Stabilizing the market is not only the obligation of the financial industry, but also the responsibility of the financial authorities and national banks. If they only know to tighten up indiscriminately, regardless of the severity or urgency, and the regulations on deposit reserve are too rigid, forming a freeze, and the central bank is unable to do its best to support the industry when necessary, it is inevitable that people will have something to say. We sincerely hope that with the full support of the financial authorities and the central bank, a joint reserve association for the banking and money industries will be established as soon as possible, so that the financial industry can concentrate its strength and funds, shoulder the burden of helping each other through thick and thin, maintain collective security, and cope with possible future difficulties.

### Reply Letter from the Relief Sub-Bureau: Explanation of Milk Powder Quality

Nutritional Value of Skim Milk Powder Unchanged

I have received your letter of the 5th of this month, and the four letters from readers attached to it, and I will reply to you as follows: (1) For questions asked by Mr. Zhang Yingzhi and Mr. Zhu Yunsheng, please refer to the Interim Measures for Applying for Milk Powder. Five copies of the measures are attached. (2) Regarding the points asked by Mr. Wang Sheng and Mr. Wang Gengcai about the milk powder distributed to students, the milk powder issued by this bureau is "skim milk powder" rather than "whole milk powder" containing butter. Therefore, this type of milk powder, in addition to milk fat, retains all the various nutrients that should be in milk and has not lost them. However, the powder is coarser, has no butter aroma, and has no turbidity. This milk powder is not suitable for direct drinking and must be prepared. For the method, please refer to the "Instructions for Skim Milk Powder" issued by this bureau. Five copies of the instructions are attached. Corresponding to the above two points, the original four letters are returned with the letter. I hope you will check and reply separately. It would be greatly appreciated if it could be published. Sincerely, the Social Service Section of the Shen Bao Editorial Department. Five copies of the attached form, Instructions, and four copies of the original letter. Shanghai Branch of the Post-War Relief Administration, July 11.

Recruiting Talent: A certain English publishing company in another port plans to hire several men and women who are proficient in Chinese-English translation. College graduates who are interested in news and propaganda and can work hard, please send your letters and recent works to this column for handover. Those who meet the requirements will be contacted for an interview.

### Difficult Days After Victory

Editor: Today, after victory, terrible facts have been brought to our classmates. Students have no books to read, the cost of living is rising, parents have no ability to bear it, and teachers cannot receive their salaries. Such facts have to fall into stagnation. Victory has brought some hunger and bandits to the people. Peiping is a city of culture, and the number of bandits is due to the pressure of life. The prices after victory are indeed astonishing. The heavy burden of life is really too much for the people to bear. Many people die on the line of life! (Zhang Hongwen, sent from Beiping)

### How Heavy are the Excessive Taxes?

Mr. Editor:

After the July 7th Incident and the outbreak of war, I took my wife and children to the rear, enduring all kinds of hardships along the way. With victory, I returned to my hometown. The house was burned, the fields were barren, everything was gone. With great difficulty, I borrowed tens of thousands of dollars from various sources and started a small business in the township. The income wasn't much, but it was enough to barely maintain our current life, and I was satisfied. But before long, a gentleman with a Mauser pistol came, saying he was investigating the population, asking questions endlessly. In the end, he left with a smile. Then a certain committee member came, investigating the population, organizing Baojia (local security units), and left with investigation fees, handling fees, and registration fees. The police station wanted compilation fees for compiling house numbers. The township security team wanted funding (the people in the occupied areas even had to pay opening fees and regular annual fees, which is truly outrageous). The tax bureau officials wanted to levy business tax, commodity tax, stamp tax, house and shop donation, and land donation (merchants in the occupied areas had to pay back taxes from before the victory. The director of the tax bureau was from another province and was followed by many armed men, a truly imposing sight). After the president of the Chamber of Commerce negotiated (it is said that there is something shady here), the Chamber of Commerce took over and offered a huge "Feng" character as a complete offering. The government, to protect the safety of the people and strengthen self-defense forces, apportioned gun fees, and urged collection day and night with the utmost urgency. However, until now, a certain Baozhang (local security head) still privately owes tens of thousands of dollars in gun fees at the time of handover, and it remains unresolved. This is probably because he worked hard as Baozhang for several months, and made some minor contributions, right? A certain section chief and a certain director apportioned cigarettes sold by the Chamber of Commerce at "honest prices for all ages". There were also numerous other items such as welcome fees, comfort fees... too many to list. Under all this exploitation, I left my hometown again and resumed a life of wandering. What should I do?

Sincerely, (Huang Fu)

### Statement from the Coffin Repository Regarding No Price Increase

To Whom It May Concern: I recently read Mr. Huang Chunfu's article "The Coffin Repository Raises Prices Again and Again" in the Reader's Opinion column of your newspaper on June 28th, which is inconsistent with the facts. Our repository's regular coffin storage fee is 26,000 yuan per year, and there has been no increase to more than 38,000 yuan. The funeral procession fee of 10,000 yuan also does not include items such as sanitation donations or handling fees, and to say that we demand more than 100,000 yuan under various pretexts is truly surprising. Furthermore, coffin storage, funeral procession and other fees are fixed, how can we collect them indiscriminately? Mr. Huang Chunfu can come to our office to discuss this matter immediately in order to clarify the situation. (Respectfully, Pu'an Coffin Repository).

### Milk Powder Distribution Was Not Embezzled

Mr. Editor: We recently read a letter in the Reader's Column of your newspaper on July 4th entitled "Students Cannot Receive Milk Powder", which is inconsistent with the facts. This school, when applying for Relief Administration milk powder on behalf of students this time, consulted the Education Bureau regarding the National Compulsory Education Classes attached to our school. According to the Education Bureau, "the National Compulsory Education Classes can also apply", so the 104 students in the National Compulsory Education Classes of our school were included in the application form. After receiving the milk powder, it was distributed in full. As for the Public Education Classes, this school did not apply because it did not receive a clear affirmative response, so there was no way to distribute it. The statement in the letter that "the milk powder was received in the name of students and taken away completely by the school" is absolutely false. The Relief Administration and the Education Bureau can investigate this matter. If it is true, our school is willing to accept the most severe punishment. Xu Chenfei, a student at our kindergarten, and Xu Jingfen, a student in the second grade, had a dispute with our school regarding the distribution of milk powder. Later, a newspaper published a false letter under a pseudonym accusing our school of profiting from the milk powder. Our school sent a letter correcting the facts. Now your newspaper has received a similar false letter. It is likely from the same source. Please publish this letter to correct public opinion. Private Jingrui Elementary School.

Spring and Autumn

### Random Thoughts on Reading

— Zhong Yuan

A young man with slender eyes and delicate eyebrows read a moving novel and told people with a smile: "Ah! I drank a glass of fine wine!" He read a light and淡雅 essay and told people with a smile: "Ah! I drank a bowl of clear tea!" He read a serious论文 and told people with a smile: "Ah! I ate a dose of good medicine!"

This young man can truly be said to be outstanding, because the general phenomenon is always like this: Confucian scholars look down on novels, scolding them for encouraging theft and lasciviousness, and damaging morality. Young people hate boring论文, saying they are like催眠符 and灵灵灵。People who love plain and profound文章 also嫌浪浪,一律一律。

In fact, nothing in the world can be generalized. There are indeed many novels that encourage theft and lasciviousness, but the power of valuable novels to teach and move people is more than ten thousand times greater than the great theories of Confucian scholars. Many浓浓文字 are indeed a waste, but we cannot deny the loveliness and greatness of a beautiful poem. As for serious说教, it does indeed give people a headache, but as the saying goes, "good medicine tastes bitter"; moreover, modern "good medicine" has been gradually improved, some are coated with sugar, and some are mixed with sweet juice, so they are not necessarily "bitter"!

People often call books the "food" of the spirit, and I think this is very appropriate. It is indeed beneficial for a person to "love all kinds of fish, meat, vegetables".

### Little Qing (Fiction)

— Shi Bei

For years I have wandered, time passing in loneliness. Though I am not yet white-haired and wrinkled, after being weathered by the elements and dust, the luster of my radiant youth has faded a little. In order to isolate myself from the muddy and superficial world, I often use the pure innocence of childhood and the willfulness and frankness of youth as the courage to live on.

Whenever I am close to children, their words, laughter, and jumps seem like all the emotions accumulated in my heart are poured out, creating a lively and active model. This is why I love them and easily become their little companion.

Little Qing is my friend's niece. Her hair is deep, dark, and dense. Her eyes are bright and sparkling, moving very cleverly and intelligently. At first glance, she seems like a six- or seven-year-old girl, but she is only four years old this year. Because she doesn't live with us, she often comes to play with her grandmother.

When I first met her, she looked at me strangely. Because I had just come from the south not long ago, and was staying at my friend's house, she knew that she had never seen someone like me in this house. She was a little suspicious and timid. My friend said to her, "Little Qing, this is also an uncle, you should call him uncle."

She didn't call me, just stood there, but the suspicion had lessened. I greeted her in Southern Mandarin, but she didn't understand, just "uh, uh,"ed. She saw her uncle laughing beside her, and she laughed too. I then learned to say in awkward Shanghai dialect, "You don't understand what I just said, do you?"

"Don't understand! Don't understand!"

"I just came back from America, I'm speaking American, no wonder you don't understand," I deliberately teased her.

"You're really lying, what American is that? Halloo, yes, Halloo, yes, you don't even know how to say that!" she retorted. In a moment, she seriously repeated Halloo, yes... shaking her head and approaching me.

"Little Qing, really, he doesn't understand American. What he just said was actually Indian. Look at his dark face, he's Indian, just came from India, you should call him Uncle Asan," my friend joked.

"Ah! Uncle Asan!" she repeated with great interest, a lot of fresh pleasure flowing from her lips. From then on, Little Qing called me Uncle Asan. This is how I met Little Qing, and we quickly became familiar with each other.

"Little Qing, have you studied yet?" I asked her.

"I have, I study with little girls, we all read books at night."

She ran to the bookcase, took out a few children's magazines from the box, held them in her hands, opened one, sat on the low stool beside me, and began to read in a flurry. In fact, she didn't understand, she was just mimicking the way of reading, chanting and humming in a muddled way! Seeing her shaking her head and swaying her body, I couldn't help but laugh.

"Little Qing, you read really fast, I can't really hear what you're reading," I asked her seriously.

"Hush! What do you know," she said, then quickly went to get an English book, opened it on her lap, and heavily and laboriously read, "A, H, B; A, H, B," read a section and looked at me.

"Who taught you to read these?"

"My second uncle and third uncle both taught me," she said happily.

"You don't understand, you don't understand, the teacher will hit you!" she suddenly stood up, her two small arms wrapped tightly around my head, her mouth close to my ear, chattering; her feet stepped on the chair, and she climbed onto my shoulders. I don't know why, but I started yelling like she did just now "A, H, B, A, H, B;" I was thrown into a dreamlike and primal naivete.

"Why don't you ask little aunt to play?" I asked her one day.

"She's shy, I asked her, she won't come." She thought for a moment, then puckered her lips and said,

"What's there to be shy about, she's older than me, she's afraid to speak to people; adults are all like that, I really hate them!"

Because I had to write a letter, I didn't talk to her, and didn't pay attention to her. When I finished writing the letter, I looked back and saw Little Qing standing on a small stool, leaning against the dressing table, spreading hair oil with a comb, and combing her hair while looking in the mirror, with a few uneven piles of snow flower cream smeared on her cheeks. I couldn't help but laugh and ask her:

"Little Qing, what are you doing?"

"Combing my hair." At this time, she seemed a little shy, and said softly.

I fixed it for her, and she looked at her image in the mirror in contentment, a knowing smile on her face. Like a little angel, she was much more beautiful and delicate. This little soul already understands how to dress up and understands the pleasure produced by beauty. I thought to myself, isn't this the innate goodness of man?

Sometimes, when she saw me spacing out, she would scold me like she was lecturing me:

"You're really a dork!" Then she would tell me how to play and sing for a long time without stopping...

Once, she found a few envelopes on my desk, and asked me to give her a piece of stationery, saying she wanted to write a letter to her little aunt. After I gave her a piece of paper, she picked up the ink brush and drew many crooked lines, covering the whole paper without writing a single word.

"Have you finished writing? What did you write? Read it to me." I looked intently at her lovely appearance.

"I wrote this: Little Aunt, Uncle is in Shanghai, tell him to buy me some books." She clicked her head and read these two sentences, then reminded me, saying:

"Oh, and I also wrote to buy a doll." She pointed to the last line of lines, folded it up, and put it in the envelope.

Although I saw that what she wrote was not words, I didn't laugh at her; I thought that when her虚托文字 were read repeatedly, there would be errors that did not correspond to each other, so I asked her to take out the letter again and read it again, but she could still read the words she had just said, without any errors.

These are magical lines, woven into pure and innocent images! I was deeply moved, and when I looked at the full of nothing things I had written, I felt the shame and sadness of being fooled by age and worldliness!

It's been more than a week. Little Qing hasn't come to play with us. The letter she wrote last time was not taken away, I unfolded it again to see it; I hope to use this pure and innocent line to weave a human heart that is always brilliant and pure.

Long Serial

### Staying Together as a Pair of Lovebirds (84)

— Zhao Qingge

Brigade Commander "Dry Father" ran over and grabbed Lihua's hand, muttering again:

"Silly child, Dry Father will naturally let your mother come together! Dry Father will buy a house for you two; send orderlies to serve you, no matter what you eat or wear; Dry Father will take care of it."

Lihua knew things were not going well, and quickly stood up and said:

"I should go to the garden now. Dry Father!"

However, Brigade Commander "Dry Father" hugged her like an old eagle grabbing a chick, chuckled and said:

"It's early, my dear! Don't sing opera anymore, see how hard singing opera is! Dry Father has a lot of money, Dry Father will let you enjoy yourself, and raise you to be as fat as Dry Father! "Saying that, he touched Lihua's spine. "Oh! Your body is as thin as a bag of bones, my treasure! Don't do this anymore, tell your mother tomorrow, your mother will definitely be happy too." Brigade Commander "Dry Father" said, then drank a full glass of wine, and picked up a chopstick of vegetables and fed it directly to Lihua's mouth. "Eat! My sweetheart!"

"Dry Father, put me down, Dry Father, put me down!" Lihua turned her head away, struggling to break free from Brigade Commander "Dry Father's" embrace.

"Don't make trouble, sit obediently on Dry Father's body! Dry Father loves you!" Gentleman "Dry Father" said softly. He held Lihua tightly, and brought his mustache-covered lips over to kiss Lihua.

A scene from five years ago flashed in Lihua's mind again, and she resisted Brigade Commander "Dry Father" as she had resisted Zhang Xian back then. She felt even more serious terror! She dodged and shouted:

"Let me go! Dry Father! Let me go!"

Brigade Commander "Dry Father" didn't seem to hear, and gently turned Lihua's face, using his wine-scented mouth to kiss Lihua's mouth. This made Lihua unable to shout anymore, made Lihua fall into suffocation; made Lihua almost faint!

Just at this moment of extreme danger, a clap of thunder shocked Brigade Commander "Dry Father"—the door suddenly opened, and a woman with the majesty of a lion walked in, Brigade Commander "Dry Father" raised his head, "slap slap slap", met with a few slaps, he fled in a mess.

At this time, Lihua had not yet recovered her senses, and "slap slap" sounds flew to her cheeks!

### Random Thoughts in the Garden

— Xie Zi

Today because I didn't take a nap, my mother asked me to come to the room to rest for a while, but I really didn't want to sleep. I felt that it was too wasteful to spend this quiet and happy day in my sleep. This kind of happy day will turn into a relic in the blink of an eye, and my childhood has indeed turned into a relic. Where should I look for it?

I gently closed the door and walked along the green fence. It was really windy today, and the courtyard was full of fallen leaves dancing in the autumn wind. I closed my eyes and walked forward against the wind on the old path that I used to run on. I felt like I had returned to my old life, everything here was so familiar: the creaking sound of the small wooden door turning; the sound of leaves blowing from the branches and rubbing against the fence; and the sound of groups of birds shaking their wings and flying in the wind.

I opened my eyes occasionally, and I saw several clumps of silver chrysanthemums gathered together, blooming so brightly. Because we don't like yellow chrysanthemums, there are only purple and white ones here. The fence had been broken by the wind, and the entire chrysanthemum bed looked a bit desolate. Beside the chrysanthemum bed was a damp and winding stream. On the other side of the stream was a thatched pavilion. In this season of autumn wind and falling leaves, everything was dyed with the atmosphere of autumn.

I remember the first time I left home, I cried to my heart's content here. Later, when I heard my mother calling me, I hurriedly wiped away my tears, but I didn't dare to go directly to my mother's side, and only hesitated by the window. When my mother asked me questions, I answered through the window. At this time, there were a few swallows chirping on the beam. I felt that my voice was also as unclear as the swallows' chirping, but the swallows were happy, while I was carrying a crying mood. This mood may not have completely disappeared even now! However, I have returned home.

——Home, this is what I have been missing for the past two years, and what I have been searching for alone in countless similar dreams. Two years cannot be considered a very long period, but this time when I came home, everyone said that I had changed. My mother told me that I was thinner than before, less childish, and saw a little bit of melancholy in my expression that she didn't want to see. I said maybe it was because I missed home too much. My mother asked me again and again if I had encountered anything unpleasant in the past two years; whether I had a feeling of being helpless after leaving home; whether there were any unexpected shocks and hardships on the journey. She stroked my hand and asked me with a smile, why are my eyes always teary, I still can't get rid of my childish temper, so I simply leaned in my mother's arms and cried bitterly. I didn't encounter anything unpleasant, but mother, after more than two years of separation, I have a deeper understanding of the warmth that the family gives me, and a deeper understanding of my mother's affection for me, it is truly engraved in my heart!

It wasn't just me who changed this time, the whole family has changed a bit. My brother is already a complete adult, and my mother's cloud-like temples have also added a lot of silver threads. Even the small garden I dreamed of no longer has its former appearance. I stood beside the messy chrysanthemum bed, the distant scenery was hazy with smoke. The sun had revealed the pale color of the day after tomorrow. I walked along the stream and went all the way to the stone steps of the pavilion. I sat there, watching the leisurely stream, I wanted to see in the stream what changes I have made, but the stream was always gurgling, making me unable to see my own shadow clearly. Gradually, I forgot my original intention, my eyes followed a fallen leaf, drifting to a distant place.

Suddenly, a past impression floated in my heart again, the situation was almost exactly the same as now, but how different was my mood at that time! At that time, my mother, my brother, and I were sitting together in the pavilion. I don't know how, my mother suddenly remembered to ask us about our future aspirations. My brother said that he hoped to travel all over the world, and after experiencing a career, return home to show filial piety to his mother. I said that I don't have such a big wish, I would feel very happy as long as I can always be with my mother. Later, we did a kind of test. Each person picked a flower and threw it into the stream. Whoever's flower drifted far away meant that they would have a wandering life in the future. As a result, as soon as I threw my flower down, it was tripped by the stream grass, while my brother's flower floated all the way to the end of the stream. We were all so happy that we clapped our hands, as if our future destiny had been decided here. But in fact, in the past few years, my brother has been near the family, but I have been more than a thousand miles away from my mother. What will the future years be like? That is truly an elusive mystery!

But returning home, everything is stable after all. We returned from a life of moving with joy and sorrow to a life of leisure and simplicity, from passion to warmth. Even this barren garden has a kind of intimate local flavor. Look at the few bird nests on the elm tree over there, still as before, and the sparrows on the broken walls are still singing happily. All this symbolizes how peaceful and satisfying! Let me be as happy as them! We are reunited now, whether in reality or in dreams, we have obtained what we longed for, let us step with brisk steps and seek our happiness!

In this way, I embraced a full of new hope, carrying the setting sun, and ran to my house!

### Remembering My Hometown

— Qi Fan

Without my hometown, I am not saddened, for I know that one day soon I will be able to happily tread upon those lands, searching for the footprints I left in my childhood – covered with a layer of blood, and also covered with a layer of glory.

As if in a medieval dream, a line of dilapidated city walls swirls before my eyes. Facing this structure, once used for attack and defense but now a mere ruin, I can't help but sigh. In the years of raging war, I left this place of fond memories; now, with victory won, I began a journey back to my hometown by chance, though for such a short time. Amidst the rapid current of time, I felt that the people in my village had suffered enough in this great upheaval. From the overcast, I saw the spring-colored clouds; in the desert, I saw fragrant grasses and oases. It was a dream, not left in memory, but just a scar, a brand seared by fire, those are the footprints on the snow – left to time by time.

The old house after the calamity, the house where I had spent some of the beginning years of my life. The winding corridors were entwined with elegant window lattices, lingering with the splendor of the past, and inevitably covered with the faint webs of spiders. Outside the window lattice, a field of green rice paddies, indeed the mountains stones, and the rolling river.

The golden setting sun painted the dilapidated window lattices, the city walls, and the river surface. Just as dusk was dressing up, one could listen to the distant flute sounds of the shepherd boys, clear and profound, a solo of infinitely intoxicating vitality. The shepherd boy passed by the door, jumped down, tied the rope pierced through the ox's nose to the root of the tree beside him, and would gently say "Good evening" to me, his eyes radiating depth.

In the distance, several thatched cottages dyed with a strong primitive flavor, all the tunes of life were being played here, so simple and carefree.

At night, the azure forest, like blue steel, draped joy over the night sky, and the river flowed towards the distant horizon.

Under the moonlight, I invigorated myself, and the knot of anger that had been stuck in my chest for the past few years slowly melted away.

My heart was clearly illuminated.

### Offering Flowers

— Song Mengqin

In recent years, my flower vase has often been empty.

The room lacked beautiful spring scenery, and also lacked refreshing autumn colors. Living there, if there was no strong stimulus from the heat or cold, I would forever be muddle-headed and unaware of winter and summer. Friends all said that lingering in this room could make one forget the years. But who knows that this desolation, this emptiness, this lack of vitality, is not by choice?

I love flowers the most. Cut flowers are rarely seen in the north. When I was a child living in a northern city, I could only secretly break off a few branches of magnolia, chrysanthemum, or plum from the garden to put in a vase. If my father ever noticed, he would always scold me for being a selfish child.

After coming south, the first good impression that entered my mind was the constant sound of flower sellers in the streets, which not only reduced the scolding for secretly breaking off flowers from the garden, but also gave me endless leisure and aesthetic pleasure from that clear, sweet, and gentle tone. There was not a day that I didn't get up early, not a day that I didn't secretly open the side door to buy a few bunches to carefully put in the vase, a task that would often sacrifice the entire morning.

Day after day, month after month, year after year passed, and strangely enough, offering flowers did not give me any aesthetic comfort, but only layered up the crux of doubt. I wondered if it was because the flowers in the north were easier to arrange, or if my flower arranging skills as a child were better than now? Was this change in the flowers, or in the flower arranger? Why could I never be satisfied, even with arranging flowers every day?

Experience is like this: a vase on a high table in the corner of the room is easier to be satisfied with; you only need to arrange a few branches in a staggered manner, and it will not lose a kind of pure and tranquil charm. A vase on a desk against the wall is also relatively easy to make barely satisfactory, as long as you take care of the beautiful points on three sides. Only a vase on a table in the middle of the room! For years, it has never been possible to be satisfied with it. If you arrange the front well, there will inevitably be omissions in the back; if you pay attention to the left side, you will surely find unevenness on the right side; even if you can barely succeed on all four sides, when you stand in front of the table and look down occasionally, that kind of messy and unsightly appearance will give you the greatest disappointment.

Because of this, I have smashed flower vases, scolded servants, and also crushed fresh flower branches.

I remember a friend smiling and comforting me: "Why bother! You only need to decorate the side facing the door carefully, so that people who just enter the room will have a good impression at first sight, and preconceived notions will naturally arise in their hearts, making them feel that there is beauty everywhere. Why be so perfectionist?"

My brother advised me: "You only need to arrange the side opposite the sofa you usually sit on artistically, because only you can truly understand yourself. Why be serious about the rest!"

My father said with a smile: "This child really has some obsessions! Let me ask you, is there anything in the world that is perfect? Even if there is, it still has the limits of perfection, and what about one in ten thousand and one?" My father said, patting me on the shoulder, and I also smiled inexplicably.

My flower vase has been empty for a long time under a cloud of doubt and hesitation. Every time I see it, a feeling of sadness and anxiety makes me feel lost.

### Formalism in Acting

— Ye Zi

This school of theatre is represented by Meyerhold, who opposed psychological theatre and raised the banner of new aesthetics and new ethics. He was an enemy of naturalism, unwilling to reproduce real life, and created a special stage world, concentrating and refining the atmosphere of modern life through honed formal techniques. Therefore, his position is in clear opposition to the Moscow Art Theatre. He was originally a member of the earliest group in this theatre and worked with it for four years. But later he discovered that this theatre did not fit his ideals, and left because he was thoroughly dissatisfied with the methods used. He felt that Stanislavski's naturalistic expression restricted the expression of the stage and could not get a response from the audience. He believed that the duty of theatrical expression lay in expressing and conveying to the audience.

In his theatre, the director is the center. It can be said that the entire performance is dominated by Meyerhold's strong and poetic personality. Therefore, he calls himself the "author of the performance." In order to express this personality, he takes full responsibility for expressing his ideas. He observes life from his own special angle. Playwrights, actors, stage scenery, furniture arrangement, props, lighting, and colors are all only for him to express his ideas. He leads them, guiding them with a firm and unwavering hand. Therefore, Meyerhold once said: "The most precious thing in art is the work created by the artist with his own spirit. The content of the artwork is the artist's spirit. The actor on the stage is like the clay placed in front of the sculptor, and must, like the sculptor, make the content - the eruption of his own spirit and his feelings - concrete in a clear form. For...the actor, his spirit must be assisted as if explained to the audience - this is the only mission of acting." For Meyerhold, acting is not a realistic and active reflection, but a form of self-expression. The so-called objective world is just a creation that is essentially different.

Meyerhold had long felt that theatrical art must be independent, and that playwrights and directors should have the freedom to interpret the script. This led him to bolder conclusions. Therefore, he believed that all kinds of changes made to the script were unavoidable and legitimate. And during the October Revolution, because of the lack of suitable plays, he decided to create some himself. Based on theatrical history, he believed that theatres should have their own playwrights, so he himself took on the role of the absent playwright.

In terms of basic artistic methods in performance, he proposed the principle of conditionality, which was used as a fighting weapon against naturalism. He hated the reproduction of naturalistic phenomena, believing it to be crude and ugly. Therefore, he once said in "Collected Essays on Theatre": The audience in the theatre "is not coming to see real life, but to see human art. But how can the repetition of oneself on the stage be called art? The audience is craving fiction and acting. Simply giving them a repetition of oneself is just real life or slavish imitation." He paid special attention to external techniques in order to oppose the internal techniques of the art theatre. He said that any art is conditional, and that the purpose of acting, like all other arts, is not a life reflection of a certain worldview, but the explanation of the author's, director's, and actor's outlook on life. Therefore, he said, "The clarity of the image does not necessarily require strict depiction. The static acting technique is more important for the simplicity of gestures and the economy of movement than the entirety of gestures."

Therefore, he proposed a stylized and stylized creative method. He believed that the naturalistic method of treatment was too complex and too detailed. The purpose of naturalism was to express real life, while concealing the inner spirit of life. It only expressed the phenomena of things and hid the activities behind things. His opinion was that the performance of a play should show activity or spirit. For this purpose, it should be simple, extremely concentrated and concise, rather than too detailed, dispersed and redundant. If one wants to successfully convey the perfect spirit, one should try to put the spirit or activity on the stage instead of things or real life. This requires the thorough elimination of details in real life and historical details, seeking the greatest possible generalization of the era and phenomena, and exposing the hidden characteristics with all means of expression, seeking their clear inner meaning. This kind of spirit or activity is the essence extracted by the performer for the sake of theatrical communication, creating a good style. A good style on the stage can make everything belonging to the real world equally belong to the spirit and the soul. Understanding this can convey important experiences using symbols and hints. He restricts all expressive objects and media, and uses these objects to interpret. Therefore, the ideas of conditionality, generalization, and symbol are inextricably linked to the concept of stylization.

Meyerhold spent his life seeking the true way of theatrical communication. He constantly explored new methods that approached the structure of the script, and attempted to theatricalize the theatre and dramatize the drama. He focused on extracting the essence of the drama from the script, and exhausted every possible method to fully convey it to the audience. If we examine the progress of his work path, we will know that it is completely based on the search for unified symbols to convey the highest form of theatrical expression. His consistent problem was how to improve the level of understanding in the theatre, so that the important meaning of the script could be conveyed without any loss. He often said: "There are two things that are most important in the performance of a play. First, we must explore the author's ideas, and then we must express these ideas in a theatrical form. This form, we call it the 'theatrical center', and we build the performance around this center."

But the plan and attempt of acting is the work of the director, starting from himself and practicing a subjective view of art. The actor is a practitioner, a soulless puppet. The actor is not the creator of the image, but a mechanical practitioner of the living image. Removing the spirit of the actor establishes the dictatorship of the performer's creation. Therefore, talking about the performance of the actor cannot be separated from his theory and practice. Based on the principle of conditionality, and dramatizing the drama, he began by praying to integrate the audience and the actor, requiring the stage to be a mysterious connection for the audience, giving the audience the highest theatrical performance communication. Therefore, during the experimental period, he called on the actors to perform directly to the audience on a shallow stage, always thinking in their minds that they were in the theatre. The audience also thought this way when watching the play. The actor must eliminate all real life from the stage, and simplify the technique as much as possible. The audience uses their own imagination to complete the creation of the hints given by the stage, even if there are only a few. It is better for the actor to underact than to overact, and it is better to say less than to say unnecessary things. The audience must supplement what is implied with their own language. At the same time, he developed the musical ideal applied to the theatrical form, and he coordinated the actor's movements with music, creating the plasticity of the movements. (To be continued)

### The Mystery of Movie Titles

— Xin Ming

During the time when this great war was spreading, every film company in Hollywood, in order to adapt to the environment, constantly produced many war films with propaganda significance and news documentaries filmed on location. The screen was full of gunpowder and fighting scenes. Their intention was to make their own people know how bravely the soldiers of their motherland were serving the country and sacrificing themselves, in order to awaken the people of the whole country to unite and resist the enemy! On a grander scale, to let people around the world know the greatness of America's human and material contributions in this great war. As mentioned before, many such films have been shown in Shanghai after the victory. Such as: "The Lone Ranger", "Fighting Lady", "Flying Tigers", "Heart of a Nation", "Immortal Battalion", etc.

Assuming that "The Lone Ranger" is a powerful army force, and "Fighting Lady" is the alias of a giant aircraft carrier, then "Flying Tigers" is an air force that is famous around the world and has repeatedly made great achievements on the Far East front, and is most familiar to the Chinese people. The above movies include the army, navy, and air force!

### Americans Look at Chinese Farmers

— Tao Xiong

In "China Shall Rise"

In "China Shall Rise," we can see that there are several scenes that do not conform to Chinese customs, which is because Americans do not understand us well enough; at least the screenwriter and director of this film are not familiar with China.

In the film, there is such a scene: the father holds the plow, the mother leads the ox, and this old couple is plowing in the field; their daughter - a modernly dressed female student - gets out of the car and runs forward to call out "Papa" and "Mama".

China is an agricultural country, with farmers accounting for 90 percent of the national population; the vast majority of farmers till the land of small landlords, giving 50 percent of the harvest to the landlord; among this small collection, they still have to pay taxes and public expenses in the village, and the remaining grain is truly a small number among a small number. It is extremely rare for a tenant farmer to be able to work twenty mu of land. Most people work more than ten mu of land. It is impossible to support a family with the small collection of more than ten mu of land. How can they afford to send their children to school?

Self-cultivating farmers who are slightly better off mostly cultivate about thirty mu of land; if there are no helpers in the family, they have to hire short-term workers during the busy farming season. Although their lives are more comfortable than those of tenant farmers, they definitely do not have extra money to send a daughter to college. Most parents in our rural areas believe that daughters belong to other people's families, and will never spend a lot of money to send a daughter to school. Even for boys, they can only go to elementary school for three to five years at most. Otherwise, how could China have more than 90 percent illiteracy?

The lives of small landlords mostly depend on exploiting tenant farmers. If they have one or two hundred mu of land, then there are ten tenant farmers shedding blood and sweat to support them. Although they have money to send their children to school, they will not let their children receive secondary or higher education. They think that being able to keep accounts and write letters is enough. Why must they graduate from middle school and university? Anyway, being an official does not depend on knowledge, but on personal connections. If the parents' minds are not stubborn and they have modern ideas, then their children can receive more education, but they have no connection with university, at most only high school. Because the parents cannot afford their children's university education expenses.

The Chinese old couple depicted in "China Shall Rise" will definitely not be small landlords; because small landlords are unwilling to go to their own fields to cultivate; so, at most, they are just self-cultivating farmers. Is it not a strange thing to have a daughter in a self-cultivating farmer's family receiving higher education outside?

Of course, it doesn't matter in the United States, but it is different in China. Chinese farmers rely on a pair of hands to work in the fields, and the efficiency of work is limited; the United States uses machines to farm, and the harvest they get from using machines to farm can of course have extra money to let their children go to school. At the same time, they are a progressive country, and men and women are equal, so education is also equal. What about China? The amount of harvest from manual labor will definitely not exceed the performance of machine harvest; at the same time, gender equality is just a sign for the intellectual class to benefit society for both men and women, and it does not exist in the countryside and all families; this is related to economic conditions.

Therefore, this point in "China Shall Rise" is just an imagination in the minds of Americans, not our Chinese situation. From this, we can see that Americans do not have a real understanding of our Chinese rural economy, farmer life, the feudal consciousness that has not been eliminated, and the old concept of valuing men over women. Their so-called understanding is only a superficial layer!

### Prospects for the Experimental Drama School

— Gu Zhongyi

The Municipal Experimental Drama School has been established since last November, and it has been seven months. Of those seven months, two were spent on renovations, and the spring semester has lasted nearly four months. Soon, summer vacation will begin. Although only a little over seven months have passed from its inception to now, the hardships and struggles could fill a book. I plan to start writing this book when I have some free time in the future, as a precedent for those who run drama schools later, hoping to reduce some of the unwarranted suffering and avoid many detours. However, at present, things are still chaotic and I am overwhelmed, so writing it down now would not be presentable. Nevertheless, in order to give the public a clear understanding of the drama school, I must give a rough overview of the current situation.

(1) Facilities

The drama school is located in the former First Japanese National Primary School at the northern end of Yokohama Bridge on North Sichuan Road. It is a large four-story Western-style building. The ground floor houses offices, a carpentry workshop, an electrical workshop, a dining hall, a reception room, the student union office, and a social room. The second floor contains classrooms, rehearsal rooms, a singing room, and a library. The third floor is the Municipal Museum. The fourth floor includes a small theater, student dormitories, and storage rooms. In front of the school building is a playground and a sports field. There is a swimming pool in the back.

The equipment inside the building has not been fully furnished due to funding constraints. For example, the carpentry workshop only has a few old set pieces, the electrical workshop is completely empty, the classrooms are filled with small desks and chairs (left over from the Japanese primary school), and the library contains mostly Japanese books, except for a small number of newly purchased scripts. Only the small theater has been largely completed, with a stage depth of 24 feet and a width of 28 feet. The lighting equipment and curtains are mostly adequate. It has been used for one public performance, staging several one-act plays.

(2) Departments

Currently, there are regular and research programs. The regular program is divided into drama and film departments, each with technical and acting groups. The research program focuses on research in writing and directing. Applicants must have a university degree or equivalent qualifications, experience in writing and directing, and the ability to read English and French directly. The regular program requires a junior high school education, but there are also high school graduates and university dropouts. Currently, there are over ninety students in the regular program and only three in the research program.

(3) Faculty

The only thing the drama school can be proud of is that all the full-time professors and the director are the nation's top theatrical figures. Mr. Wu Renzhi is our director of academic affairs and a lecturer. Mr. Huang Zuolin is the director of our drama department and a professor of basic rehearsal and directing techniques. Mr. Zhang Junxiang is the director of our film department and a professor of basic rehearsal and directing guidance. Mr. Li Jianwu is the director of our experimental theater and a professor of script analysis and selected famous plays. Other professors include Shi Tuo, Yu Nanqiu, Ru Ji, Hu Xin'an, Yan Gongshang, Sokolsky, Chen [blank], and Lu Baike, who teach important subjects such as literary history, introduction to art, makeup, stage technology, rehearsal, Mandarin Chinese, dance, and singing, respectively.

There are also special training courses outside of the curriculum, such as Kunqu opera studies and piano training, taught by experts like Bi Bing [blank] and Pan Meibo. Morning exercises are held at 7:15 a.m., and ball sports are played at 4:00 p.m., with guidance from experts such as Mr. Cao Yu and Mr. Wang Jihuai.

(4) Performances

In just seven months, there have already been two official public performances. The first was in early March at the Lyceum Theatre, staging "Beacon Fire in the Ancient City," written by Mr. Gu Yiqiao and directed by Mr. Wu Renzhi and Mr. Hu Xin'an. The second was at the end of May in the school's small theater, staging two one-act plays, "The Executioner" and "Fiancés." The third public performance is planned for the beginning of the summer vacation, with the program tentatively set as "Compatriot Sisters" and three one-act plays before the opening, "Gilding," directed by Mr. Hu Xin'an, Ji Zuolin, and Wu Renzhi, respectively.

Postscript

This drama school, which is just beginning to take shape, still faces many difficult problems. These difficult problems require not only the continued efforts of all the teachers and students but also the support of the public. Now, I will write down the most important issues below:

(1) Urgent Need to Add Books and Equipment: Books and all technical equipment are the soul of the drama school, but the Bureau of Education, due to budget constraints, has no dedicated funds to allocate to us for the purchase of books and technical equipment. Of course, the more funds we need this time, the better, but at a minimum, we need around two million yuan to achieve even a basic scale.

(2) Not Enough Full-Time Professors: The Bureau of Education stipulates that there are only twelve full-time teachers. According to the current situation, this is not enough. The professors of many important subjects are still part-time. Next semester, at least two more classes will be added, and at least one-third more full-time professors will be needed. In addition, singing and dance professors should also be full-time so that they can have individual teaching time.

(3) Society Does Not Value Drama Enough: Our compatriots still look down on drama, and often prevent their children from studying at drama school. As a result, many talented people cannot enroll because they cannot get their family's consent, and many young people with aspirations in drama drop out halfway due to family opposition. Drama education is truly the most effective tool in social education, and engaging in drama is the noblest profession. Actors are artists, not ordinary "entertainers." This poses a great obstacle to the drama school. Society is not sympathetic enough to the drama school, and young people who aspire to study drama do not have enough freedom to choose their careers.

(4) Too Few Publicly Funded Spots: Many young people who study drama are poor, and the number of publicly funded spots in the school is too small (due to funding constraints), so many poor but aspiring young people cannot enter. The drama school hopes that the public can sympathize and provide loans, and plans to hold practical performances, using the income and profits as living allowances for poor students. On the other hand, it hopes that the government will understand the importance of drama education and provide many public-funded spots in particular.

Whether the drama school has a future depends entirely on whether the many difficult problems above can be solved smoothly in the shortest possible time. Our own strength is very weak, but there are many people in society who show us great sympathy. We hope that they can give us material or spiritual assistance.

### Cholera Exports

— Shao Fu

Last night, I went to the station to see a friend off. As soon as I entered the station, I saw two tables covered with white cloths, with people in white coats sitting there. This was a team dedicated to giving vaccinations to travelers.

It is said that because cholera is rampant in Shanghai, those who buy train tickets must present proof of vaccination. I asked my friend if he had done so, and he said that the ticket was bought by someone else and he had not heard that any proof of vaccination was required. I then went to the traveler exit and looked, but I did not see any personnel checking proof of vaccination.

We know that the Chinese people are behind in intelligence, and their inherent laziness is deeply rooted. Even though getting vaccinated is beneficial to oneself, it often requires coercion. Setting up vaccination teams at train stations, docks, or airports is certainly welcome for any traveler to get vaccinated, but if you don't check the vaccination certificates of travelers entering Shanghai at the exit, how many travelers will take the time out of their busy schedules to take care of the vaccination team! Should we only prohibit cholera "exports" and let cholera "imports" happen?

Furthermore, it seems that travelers who do not buy tickets in the usual places do not need to have proof of vaccination, so even the prohibition of "exports" has "smuggling."

### Old Goods Stalls and Bargains

— Gang Ren

Shanghai, of course, has many rich people; but there are even more "people who are made rich," middle and lower-class citizens. Therefore, it is not surprising that there are many old goods stalls.

You can find old books on Fourth Road and Fuxing Road, with every volume complete; buy old clothes on Linsen Road, and you are guaranteed to be satisfied; if you want to buy wooden furniture, of course, go to Pingjili Road, where you can find everything; and Kade Road and Hongkou Qiujiang Road can indeed be called "Old Department Store Companies"; the "out-of-stock" goods sold by the Japanese some time ago should now be the enemy and puppet materials sold by the Jianghai Customs.

In these places, people can often find the suitable and cheap things they need; therefore, business is quite developed. Now that summer has arrived, the evening, when there is no scorching sun, should be the most active time; strolling the streets, enjoying the cool breeze, and "getting cheap goods," what could be better?

However, don't be too happy. If you are too dull, you may be tricked and suffer a loss, and you may even be scolded as "wrongfully dead."

Seeing others boasting about how good and how good the bargains they bought are, people who are willing to be practical and want to save a little money should be tempted!

Therefore, why don't you go there too!

At a glance, you can almost see a smiling face that immediately follows up with a fierce and vicious look.

Upon asking, the price is "sky-high," which first makes you have to be shocked, and quickly "haggle down," but sometimes the price is so high that even if you "haggle down," it is still not very cheap. If he has a bigger air, he will sell it to you, and if you happen to see some minor flaws, you think about it and feel uncomfortable; but just wait for you to hesitate and ask a question! Hum! Then

His eyes will bulge, and his arms will be crossed, "Are you planning to buy it? (!)"

You will have to be forced to buy it uncomfortably, and then walk away amid curses.

There are "good people," but such things are indeed very common.

There are plenty of bargains! Can you "handle" this kind of incident!

Therefore, you must have a method!

Tell you, don't be too greedy for cheap things, because no one in the world is willing to "suffer losses," you must first decide what you want to buy? Do you want to see anything else? How much money are you prepared to spend? (Of course, this refers to a considerable degree of cheapness.) Then go boldly.

Originally, there is no fixed rule for buying old goods; in short, you must have an idea and have vision.

You will never encounter eye-bulging, and you will not expect anything to happen, and you will smoothly bring back "results."

Otherwise, if you are not prepared like this, and you do not have this ability; you must be prepared to receive a scolding, with bulging eyes, "Are you worthy to buy it? (!)"

At that time, are you angry?

### Penicillin Allocation - Cancel Control

— Ying Dai

The US government is said to be implementing the cancellation of control over the allocation of penicillin in the country starting on July 1st. Therefore, drug merchants sent representatives to hold a meeting with officials in Washington on June 15 to discuss the issue of prohibiting the movement of penicillin in various regions. Because the production of penicillin is currently quite abundant, it is enough for doctors to use. The entire new drug industry in the United States can now produce 200 billion units of penicillin per month, which is four times more than last summer, and the production of 18.38 billion units in February has obviously increased a lot.

As for the control of exports, it seems that it cannot be cancelled at the same time as the cancellation of domestic control. However, according to people in the pharmaceutical industry, it will definitely be cancelled after a considerable period of time. The reason for controlling exports is to prevent large-scale sales from resulting in certain countries purchasing large quantities and reselling them to other countries, profiting from them, which would cause countries that need it to be unable to buy it. According to past situations, it has been confirmed that at least one country has resold imported penicillin to other countries, causing it to be traded on the black market.

Recently, countries around the world need to purchase penicillin from the United States. The Latin American countries that need it may be adequately supplied, but many countries in Europe and the Far East still do not have enough penicillin allocated to them. Letters and telegrams applying for export have been sent to the United States one after another. The pharmaceutical industry believes that adequate quantities can be supplied overseas soon.

Since domestic distribution is no longer controlled, it is important for pharmaceutical merchants to hold meetings to discuss issues related to the production and sales of penicillin. The panic of hospitals lacking penicillin will soon be eliminated, and adequate supplies will be provided. Although the range of penicillin treatment is very wide, people in the American pharmaceutical industry believe that the need in summer will definitely be less than usual.

Regarding the manufacture of penicillin, not only injections, but also tablets and other forms are being actively manufactured for swallowing and topical application. The selling price of penicillin has been quite stable, with no excessive rise or fall. According to people in the pharmaceutical industry, there will not be an excessive increase in the short term, but at the same time, it will not fall sharply. Future changes will only be a few percent up or down.

Currently, oral penicillin is as popular as injections. In terms of the selling price in the United States, a box of twelve tablets containing 300,000 units of penicillin sells for US$2.25, while an injection containing 300,000 units sells for US$1.80. The main reason why tablets are more expensive than injections is that the cost of manufacturing is naturally added to the selling price. Therefore, the selling prices of tablets and injections are different.

### Cruel "Love"

— Jin Fu

Undeliverable Letter

X: In your sweet honeymoon period, please forgive me, the forgotten one, for bothering you for a few more minutes. Do you remember when you got married, you complained about why I didn't go to congratulate you? Miss, when these words entered my ears, the ups and downs of my mood were not difficult to imagine.

X: Do you remember when we met, do you remember the dream of the two of us walking under the moon? From that time on, I dare not say that I must think of you every day, but I can say that at least four or five times a day your image has been in my mind, until now, until forever. Although we haven't known each other for long, I can say that I have fallen into an inextricable deep sea. In that sea, I have hope, I have comfort, I have sweetness. Who knows that these have all become the bitter cup of today. Hardships and pain are not the harvest of what was planted before. Who says it's just hardships and pain, shouldn't the heart also wither, the tears also run out, and the fresh blood also burst out?

The moon guarded by the stars is still the same as last year. I remember this day last year, I had to leave Shanghai temporarily because of a factory matter. Like tonight, the night before, you and I slowly paced on the asphalt road. On that quiet road, the branches were playing Qing Festival rhythms for us, the breeze was sending our harmony, and the drizzle was brushing on our faces, making it impossible to tell whether it was worry or sorrow, and it was impossible to express the emptiness in my heart. My mouth whistle was blowing a farewell tune for me. What about you? Without a sound, I was just tightly clinging to my side, and the shining eyes were only expressing attachment to me. No, those were glittering water droplets.

I also held you tightly, holding you as if afraid of losing you. I don't know if it was because of the drizzle. Water droplets also hung on my cheeks, but these were not water droplets.

X: Do you remember how the glasses hidden in my upper pocket were broken, just a silent hug. After saying everything that I wanted to say in my heart, who cares about the glasses that were broken in my pocket? But the movement of the clock broke us apart. Who knew that this farewell would become a permanent farewell. This hateful clock! Why didn't you stop forever at that time?

The victory firecrackers called back the people from other lands, but the victory firecrackers also shattered a heart full of hope.

The returnee, full of joy of reunion, did not even see your face once, until one day I saw your name in the wedding announcement, and at the same time, I received a pair of letters from you. But where is this a letter, it is simply a death warrant - a pink invitation. Fei, having suffered all kinds of humiliating oppression in foreign lands, how could I bear this great blow. You asked me to be sure to attend your wedding banquet. Isn't this like holding a knife to my neck and asking me to go to the guillotine? So, I became decadent, I fell, but the times called me back, and national affairs awakened me. I still have my future!

My eyes are blurred, my heart is sobbing, and my hand, the hand that can convey one ten thousandth of my mood, is also trembling.

I can't think anymore, I can't write anymore, I'm afraid my words will be diluted by my tears. I'm afraid my trembling heart will stop because of this. I'll stop writing here.

Although I have written the letter, who should I send it to? I am disappointed, because the world has already lost a Miss and added a Mrs. How can I send this letter to this Miss? I can only wish you here forever

You

The one you forgot, Huo, midnight, July 8

### Do You Remember the Lido Road?

### A Beggar's Words

— Wen Yi

Yesterday, I passed by Henan Road and saw a middle-aged beggar making a very meaningful announcement. He drew a bowl full of rice grains on the sidewalk and wrote: "Alas, although the rice is full, what can I do if I can't take it to fill my hunger!" He also attached a couplet: "Those who are full don't know the suffering of those who are hungry; those with the same face should not laugh at those who are out of luck." It was also very meaningful. For a time, the onlookers were like a wall, but those who generously donated money were still few.

### Opinions on the Municipal Library

— Qian

I went to the Municipal Library on Sunday and felt that this repository of spiritual food for the city had many areas that needed improvement:

First, there are more Western books than Chinese books, and there hasn't been much change since it was run by the Public Works Department. Apart from some miscellaneous bound Western-style ancient books and propaganda pamphlets, there isn't much else in Chinese. Even the newspapers are not complete. Not a single new magazine can be seen, which makes readers feel disappointed.

Second, the catalog boxes are all in Western languages. Even if you find an item, you have to ask the staff to find out where the book is located. The catalogs of newly purchased Chinese books are copied in pencil, which is blurred and illegible, and it is also unknown where the books are stored. We hope that the catalog cards can indicate the storage cabinet numbers so that readers can find them immediately upon searching.

Third, library services should not be suspended on Sundays. Although the Municipal Library is still open, all services such as borrowing books are suspended, and the elevator is also not open.

Fourth, the library environment is still quiet, and the layout is very orderly. However, the stairs are full of paper scraps, dust, and dirt, which is unsightly. I imagine that because the elevator goes up and down every day, these small details have been overlooked.

### Weak Thief

— Li Sheng

The newspaper on the 9th reported a news item about "Deidro": a beautiful female student from the University of Michigan, "Qi Yue Rushiqi," encountered a thief at night and kicked the gun out of his hand with her jade leg, and tied up the "robber" with her skirt. After reading this, I couldn't help but sigh with emotion:

Ordinary people always add the word "weak" to women, calling them weak women. And the fierce face of a robber always has a hideous appearance in the ideal, which is frightening and terrifying. Now, according to this news, it's not right at all! The robber took out a gun, but was kicked out of the hand by a woman's powder leg. After being kicked out, he didn't even escape, but was bound by the woman with a skirt belt. This is a big failure! A useless person like this can be a law-abiding citizen, but he overestimates himself and insists on being a robber. In fact, how can he be a robber? He is just a pitiful weak thief! It's no wonder that a weak thief immediately made a fool of himself when he met a strong woman.

### Explanation of the "Milk Powder and Flour Mystery"

— Hen Xin

The "Free Talk" column on July 9 published an article "The Mystery of Milk Powder and Flour". The author raised two mysterious strange things: First, the milk powder freely distributed to students by the Executive Yuan contained fine sand and had sediment. Was it really shipped from the United States by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and why did it not taste like Carnation milk powder? Second, the neighborhood chief instructed residents to collect flour, but when they took their flour sacks to collect it, the neighborhood chief replied that it was notified by the ward chief, and the ward chief replied to ask the neighborhood chief, causing that friend to run around for nothing.

In fact, these two things are not strange. I might as well explain them from the perspective of a commoner and see if these meanings are different from what the responsible authorities said.

The milk powder distributed to students by the Executive Yuan was indeed shipped from the United States, but it was skim milk (Carnation milk powder is whole milk), which can only fill the stomach and has no nutritional value. After these relief milk powders were shipped to Shanghai, they were probably left in the warehouse. When the relief officials remembered it, the milk powder had already deteriorated (milk powder is very easy to spoil, even whole milk is the same. The milk powder that the students received had already formed hard lumps the size of pebbles when they received it), so naturally, there would be sedimentation or sour taste. "Oranges across the Huai River become trifoliate oranges," so don't blame others, just blame yourself for not having the luck to eat good food.

The common people originally looked forward to receiving household flour as much as they looked forward to rain after a long drought. Therefore, the author hurriedly ran around, but why couldn't he receive it in the end? Probably the ward chief felt sorry for the people. Since receiving flour was not a fact and he had no ability to distribute it himself, he deliberately said so to give the common people the hope and happiness of a cloud. As for shirking responsibility afterwards, it can be said to be an inherent habit of the officialdom, so there is no need to be surprised. On the other hand, the author, who longed for Qing American milk powder and household flour but was disappointed, is very pitiful!

### Milk Powder Ration

— Hu Delin

I read your esteemed publication's July 9th article, "The Mystery of Milk Powder and Flour," which mentioned that consuming rationed milk powder can cause diarrhea. I have had a similar experience and consulted a doctor, who said, "Milk powder currently sold on the market, such as Carnation, Horlicks, and Golden State, are all whole milk powders with a high fat content. Consuming too much can be difficult for the stomach to digest, and a slight chill can cause diarrhea. For ordinary adults, the daily limit for milk powder consumption is generally one tael (approximately 37.5 grams), and excessive consumption is not suitable. For children, whose digestive systems are weaker, the amount should be reduced accordingly. Regular milk powder consumption can easily lead to constipation, so it is necessary to eat fruit occasionally to aid digestion.

When preparing milk powder, it is common to use a small amount of cold or lukewarm boiled water to dissolve the milk powder, stirring thoroughly with chopsticks or a teaspoon to ensure no undissolved particles remain. Then, gradually add boiling water while continuing to stir with chopsticks or a teaspoon. If this process is not followed carefully and undissolved particles remain, yellow clumps will float to the surface, and the milk powder will coagulate, making it difficult to digest. This requires careful attention.

As for the milk powder currently being rationed to students—skim milk powder—it contains no fat, is white in color, and has a fine texture, unlike whole milk powder, which has a yellowish tint. When mixed with water, it does not coagulate. When mixed with boiling water, a layer of white substance settles at the bottom, and it has a slightly sour taste, suggesting it has spoiled. No wonder students do not like to eat it.

### To My Deceased Wife, Feng Jun (6)

— Zhou Shoujuan

As the sun began to set, a clerk from a silk and satin store, acting on the orders of Zou Jinglao, delivered a large package of materials for funeral garments. There were Sheng spun fabrics, plain silk, soft satin, a vibrant mix of red and green that was truly beautiful. Bao Mei measured the dimensions and found them to be perfectly accurate, and because they were meant to be particularly loose-fitting, each piece was generously sized. The quality of the materials was also exceptionally good. If you could have opened your eyes to see it, you would surely have been pleased. Gen Yun, the son of , has always made clothes for our family. He also put in extra effort, enlisting five of his fellow tradesmen to diligently work on your funeral garments. He was quite optimistic, saying it would bring you good luck. However, the sound of the knives and rulers constantly reaching my ears simply shattered my heart. They worked together until three o'clock, almost finishing the work when a miracle suddenly occurred. Your body, which had been lying stiff and motionless all day and night, suddenly moved. Your eyes, which had been tightly closed all day and night, suddenly opened, two watery eyes staring directly at my face, as if awakening from a long dream. This sudden miracle, most likely bestowed by God, drove all of us mad with joy, even Gen Yun put down his knife and ruler. , anxiously ran to see you, his rush . After you awoke, you did not sleep again. We gave you medicine, rice porridge, and orange juice, all of which you drank without issue. For some reason, your spirits were particularly high that night. You kept talking to us, calling out to one person and then another, as if all the children were by your side. But aside from Peng'er, who was studying in Suzhou, they had all gone to Shanghai after wishing you a happy birthday. Seeing you talking so much, we feared you would tire yourself out and tried to persuade you to rest, but you would resume talking within a minute or two of stopping. You said to Bao Mei: "I had a very long dream. In the dream, I was walking alone along a bumpy road, one foot high and one foot low, which was very difficult to walk. I met my mother and our Rong'er on the road." Hearing this, we couldn't help but shudder. We knew that you had already walked the road to the underworld and met deceased relatives. Perhaps because our fate was not yet exhausted, you returned? At that moment, I couldn't help but secretly thank God for returning my twenty-nine-year-old companion who I was about to lose!

That night, I was joyfully sleepless, as sweet as on our wedding night thirty years ago. I stayed close to your side, reluctant to leave your bed. My eyes were glued to your face, reluctant to look away, sitting there until dawn. Experiencing the return of a priceless treasure after losing it, nothing in life could bring more joy than this. After dawn, I immediately wrote a letter to Zou Jinglao, reporting this unexpected good news, and also asked him to invite the renowned Western-trained doctor Yu Qihua to come and treat you. For the entire morning, I kept trying to coax you to sleep, but you remained wide awake, still chattering non-stop. One moment, you would call for Yun'er, asking if he had eaten his snack. The next, you would call for Shijing, asking if his three children were well. Then you would call for Bao Mei and Ye Ma, asking them why they weren't going to sleep. Since you were always worried and anxious, which led to this serious illness, I took advantage of this moment of near-death revival to advise you to seek pleasure and enjoyment from now on, and not to create trouble for yourself. You glanced at me with a mixture of surprise and joy and said, "You pig-head, what do I have to be unhappy about!" This "pig-head" made everyone laugh. Even though I was scolded, I was secretly pleased, feeling like I was back in the joyful, teasing days of our honeymoon.

My shock had subsided, my heart began to bloom, and I naturally regained my appetite. Around one-thirty in the afternoon, Zheng'er and Ling'er received a long-distance phone call and telegram, and they rushed back from Shanghai in fear. I heard them and went out to greet them. As soon as they saw me, they anxiously asked how their mother was, and tears started to fall.

I smiled and comforted them, saying, "Congratulations! Congratulations! Mother is out of danger." Then I led them into the room to see you. When you saw them, you were perfectly lucid, still recognizing your beloved son and daughter. You didn't know they had just come from Shanghai, and we didn't tell you, fearing that knowing you had escaped death would add to the stress. At three o'clock, Zou Jinglao kindly came with Doctor Yu. I was overjoyed and quickly asked Doctor Yu to examine you. After the examination, the doctor said that the illness was severe, had affected the heart, and was in a state of extreme weakness. For the time being, it was necessary to proceed steadily, starting with strengthening the heart. Once the heart was strengthened, blood transfusions could be used to help. I thought this sounded right and entrusted the important responsibility of saving you entirely to him. Doctor Yu then wrote a prescription very carefully and also ordered German vitamin B and C injections, to be given along with heart-strengthening injections the next day. For the next four days, we gave you injections and medicine every day, doing everything we could to proceed steadily. During those four days, you were sometimes very clear-headed and sometimes a bit confused. When you spoke to us, two-thirds of what you said made sense, while one-third seemed abnormal. You often repeated the same sentence several times, mostly advising us to eat nutritious foods, saying the word "vitamin" over and over. Zheng'er and Ling'er patiently served you medicine and stayed by your side. You once said to Bao Mei, "I think I am happy. My husband is good, and my children are good, especially Zheng. He is my heart!" Zheng'er, hearing this from the side, couldn't help but cry. In fact, you loved me, you loved all six of your children; who did you not love, who was not your heart?
