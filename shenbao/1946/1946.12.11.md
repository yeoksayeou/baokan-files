### The Constitutional Review Committee's Multi-Day Meetings Lead to Rapid Progress in Constitution-Making; Youth and Social Democratic Parties Speak Actively

[Our Nanjing Office, 10th] The Constitutional Draft Review Committee will continue its meetings on the 11th, morning and afternoon. The morning session, from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM, will address ten articles in total: Articles 1, 2, 3, and 4 (divided into three groups), 5, 6, and 7 (divided into two groups). The afternoon session, from 3:00 PM to 6:00 PM, will address six articles in total: Articles 2, 3, and 4 (divided into three groups), and 6 and 8.

[Our Nanjing Office, 10th] The preamble to the Draft Constitution of the Republic of China, after repeated debates over several meetings of the First Review Committee, was passed in its original form at the committee's third meeting on the afternoon of the 10th. The original text is as follows: "The National Assembly of the Republic of China, entrusted by all the people, based on the teachings of Dr. Sun Yat-sen in founding the Republic of China, in order to consolidate national sovereignty, protect civil rights, ensure social stability, and promote the welfare of the people, hereby enacts this Constitution, promulgates it throughout the country, and forever adheres to it." Furthermore, regarding Article 1 of the General Principles, only a minority in the meeting advocated maintaining the original text. During the final vote, all those present favored amending it and voted on the five proposed amendments that had been compiled. Of the 129 people present, 58 voted to change the article to "The Republic of China is a Democratic Republic based on the Three Principles of the People," which was the largest number, but still not a majority. Discussions will continue on the 11th.

Today's meeting was held at the Central Party Headquarters at 3:00 PM, chaired by Li Junfu of the Social Democratic Party. 134 people were present, including Zhang Ji and Zhang Mojun. The first decision was that the Review Committee would no longer be divided into three groups for discussion but would conduct collective reviews. Following this, the "Preamble" was discussed. The chairman reported that the assembly had received a total of five proposals related to the "Preamble." Representatives then spoke and discussed, focusing on the phrase "based on the teachings of Dr. Sun Yat-sen in founding the Republic of China." However, the differences were only in wording, with no major changes to the original meaning. Zhang Zhiben and others advocated maintaining the original proposal, and Yu Jiaju of the Youth Party no longer insisted on whether to use the word "based." The original proposal was ultimately voted to be maintained. Next, the meeting proceeded to discuss Article 1 of the General Principles: "The Republic of China is based on the Three Principles of the People and is a democratic republic of the people, by the people, and for the people." Regarding this article, the assembly had received a total of 24 proposed amendments, which were categorized into five major types by the convener, Huang Shaogu. The most important of these was to change it to: (1) "The Republic of China is a Republic based on the Three Principles of the People" (i.e., the original text of the May 5th Draft Constitution) (2) "The Republic of China is a Democratic Republic based on the Three Principles of the People" (with the addition of "Democratic" compared to the former). Yu Jiaju of the Youth Party believed that the original text of the May 5th Draft Constitution should not be restored, as this Draft Constitution was an amendment to the May 5th Draft Constitution by the government, proposed after government research, and therefore the original proposal should be maintained. Another Youth Party representative, Zhou Baosan, opposed adding phrases such as "Three Principles of the People" to the Republic, believing that it was rare in other countries to crown the form of government with an ideology, hoping not to leave people with the impression of a one-party monopoly. Another representative of the party, Min Da, said that if the amendment was passed by the Review Committee, the party would respect the principle of the minority obeying the majority but would reserve the right to speak, to speak at the assembly regarding the point of adding "Three Principles of the People." Wu Yanhuan said that adding it did not have a partisan color, and Tong Hangbai also believed that adding "Three Principles of the People" did not mean a one-party monopoly; the consultation draft also contained the words "Three Principles of the People." Qiu Jianyuan also said that foreign countries do not add an ideology, so why can't we be unique? Several representatives advocated adding the word "Democratic" to "Republic." Chen Guyuan said that he had come today specifically to advocate adding the word "Democratic," as economic democracy is the people's livelihood. Zhang Mojun also did not oppose adding the words "People's Rights" but said that what we are adding is "True Democracy." An Qingting said that adding the two words could reassure those who are suspicious. Female representative Zhang Xiulan and others opposed adding the word "Democratic," believing that with the Three Principles of the People, the meaning of the word "Democratic" was already included. Pi Yishu believed that adding the two words was like gilding the lily. Wu Yanhuan believed that the word "Democratic" was interpreted differently by different parties, with each person having their own saying, so it was better not to add it. Another representative gave a literal interpretation, saying: the "People" in the four characters "Republic of China" already has the meaning of democracy, and except for Turkey and Spain, very few countries in the world add the word "Democratic" to the form of government in the constitution. Finally, it was voted whether the original proposal should be amended, and all present favored amending the original proposal. Based on the five amendments summarized by Huang Shaogu, it was voted. Of the 129 people present, 11 voted to change it to "The Republic of China is a Democratic Republic," 43 voted for the original text of the May 5th Draft Constitution, 26 voted for "The Republic of China is a Democratic Republic based on the Three Principles of the People," and 58 voted to change it to "The Republic of China is a Democratic Republic based on the Three Principles of the People." Although the latter received the most votes, it did not reach a majority. It is reported that discussions will continue at the fourth meeting at 9:00 AM on the 11th. The meeting adjourned at around 4:00 PM.

[Our Nanjing Office, 10th] In addition to the second national economic subgroup, which only organized opinions from the morning meeting before noon by the convener and relevant proposers, the remaining three subgroups of the Seventh Constitutional Draft Review Committee continued their meetings in the afternoon. The first national defense and foreign affairs subgroup, with 37 representatives in attendance, was chaired by Leng Xin. The 12 proposals related to national defense were decided to be sent to the president of the country for reference by the government. After a ten-minute break, the meeting discussed Article 137 of the constitutional draft regarding foreign policy. As a result, the phrase "comply with the Charter of the United Nations" was deleted, and the phrases "equal and mutually beneficial diplomatic principles," "protecting the rights and interests of overseas Chinese," and "promoting international justice" were added. The original text was revised to "The foreign policy of the Republic of China shall be based on the spirit of independence and autonomy, the principle of equality and mutual benefit, good neighborly relations, respect for treaties, so as to protect the rights and interests of overseas Chinese, promote international cooperation, promote international justice, and ensure world peace."

The review process began, and the second item was to discuss the articles of Chapter 11 of the Constitutional Charter and the amendments proposed in the proposals, with a total of nine proposals.

(3) Pu Ru et al. proposed to include the Manchu people in the constitution in accordance with the principles of five ethnic groups coexisting in harmony and ethnic equality, according to the methods of the Mongolian and Tibetan ethnic groups. First, the name of Chapter 11: "Provincial and County System" was changed to "Local System." After voting, the majority had no objection, and the name was changed to "Local System."

The decision was that for cases related to the province, several representatives spoke to maintain the original proposal and not to change it. Zheng Yan Cai then stood up to explain the case he proposed in 337, first, to change the chapter title of Chapter 11 "Provincial and County System" to "Local System"; second, that this chapter should not be divided into sections; third, to stipulate in detail the basic principles of the general rules for provincial and county autonomy. The chairman then summarized the opinions of the various proposals into four categories: (1) This chapter is not divided into chapters and sections. (2) Divided into continents but not provinces. (3) Divided into administrative regions. (4) Maintain the original proposal. After voting, the majority voted to maintain the original proposal and passed it.

Then, Article 114 was discussed item by item. The original text was: "The province may convene a provincial people's representative assembly and formulate a provincial autonomy law based on the general rules of provincial and county autonomy, but it shall not conflict with the constitution." Divided into three key points: (1) Provincial autonomy (2) General rules of provincial and county autonomy (3) Formulation of provincial autonomy law. It was discussed immediately.

### The Fourth Review Committee Argues Fiercely Over the Right of Consent of the Control Yuan

[Our Nanjing Office, 10th] The Fourth Constitutional Draft Review Committee held its third plenary session at the Public Recreation Club at 9:00 AM on the morning of the 10th, with more than 70 representatives in attendance, chaired by Gao Yihan. The audience discussed Article 95 of Chapter 9 of the Constitutional Draft Amendment, the right of consent of the Control Yuan, for quite a long time. Some representatives believed that since the Control Yuan already has the power of impeachment, prior consent is unnecessary; otherwise, the exercise of the right of consent could prevent the Control Yuan from transcending partisanship. Other representatives believed that the power of the Control Yuan was not too great, and only the right of consent to the President of the Judicial Yuan, Grand Justices, and Examination Committee members should be retained. The two sides argued fiercely, and the meeting was adjourned at around 12:00 noon.

### Argument Arises in the Review Committee; Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioner Ding Cuying Requests Medicine to Be Included in the Constitution; Fu Sinian Strongly Argues That Science Is Medicine

[Our Nanjing Office, 10th] Anyone who is not forgetful should remember the story of Fu Sinian and Kong Geng pounding the table and roaring in the Senate over the issue of traditional Chinese and Western medicine, almost resorting to violence. At the meeting of the cultural and educational subgroup of the Seventh Review Committee on the 10th, Fu Sinian and Ding Zhongying had another big argument. Proposal No. 146 was submitted by Zheng Manqing et al., 44 people in total, "For the case that medicine should be included in Article 45 of the Constitution." Ding Zhongying, a famous doctor from Shanghai and one of the cosigners, stood up to explain. Ding was wearing a melon-skin hat, a wide robe, a long cashmere scarf around his neck, and a pair of large black round-rimmed glasses on his nose, dressed in national quintessence from head to toe. He said, "For culture, new and good things should be absorbed, and old and good things should also be promoted. Traditional Chinese medicine does not cut open the abdomen or amputate legs, but still treats diseases. It should not be obliterated. This is related to the survival of the country and must be listed in the Constitution." As soon as he finished speaking, Fu Sinian stood up immediately. Ding understood in his heart, so he stood there, cupped his sleeves over his ears, and straightened his throat to listen to Fu say: "First, doctors are free professionals. If their medical skills are high and their reputation is great, they can make money without the need for protection. Second, medicine should be science. Science is clearly stipulated in Article 145, so why list it again? I think that the issue of traditional Chinese and Western medicine should not be discussed in the National Congress again. I propose to retain this proposal." He was wearing a suit and a coat, holding a pipe in his hand, completely Westernized. Ding waited for Fu to finish speaking, then pulled down his scarf and shouted loudly, "I object to what this gentleman said. At the same time, I personally believe that Chinese people know too little about medicine and feel deeply pained. Traditional Chinese medicine is a combination of philosophy and science. Saying that medicine is science is to destroy traditional Chinese medicine. Those who do not understand traditional Chinese medicine, speak nonsense..." At this time, Chairman Hu Shuhua said, "Please do not talk about things outside the topic." Ding trembled with anger, "I won't talk about it, okay." So Chairman Hu sought everyone's opinion on how to handle this proposal. Someone suggested merging it with Proposal No. 161 and transferring it to the social security and health administration subgroup. Ding jumped up, "Let me say one more thing." Fu also jumped up, "Chairman, if he says it again, I have something to say too." He pushed his coat aside, put the pipe in his mouth, and sat down. Everyone said, "Don't say it." The dispute ended in laughter, and Ding had no choice but to sit down angrily. Later, the audience decided to transfer it to the social and health subgroup.

###  Debates Among Representatives Over the Fine Points of Wording - A Sideline Account of the Constitution Drafting Committee Meeting

— Our Reporter

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] During the meeting of the First Review Committee, there was no shortage of quibbling over the fine points of wording. Participants often argued back and forth over a single word or phrase. The most intense debate was over whether to use "based on the teachings" or "in accordance with the teachings" in the "Foreword," and especially whether to add the word "democratic" to the first article. Chen Yuanyuan strongly advocated changing the first article to "The Republic of China is a democratic republic based on the Three Principles of the People," stating, "I am attending this meeting today solely to argue for the two words 'democratic'," and explaining that the Principle of People's Livelihood is economic democracy. Ren Chexuan also rose to explain, but Di Ying, impatient to listen, quickly called out, "The bell has rung twice already, don't say any more." Pi Yishu and others opposed adding the word "democratic," believing that adding it would be "gilding the lily." Zhang Zhiben believed that adding foreign terms like "government of the people, by the people, for the people" to the first article would be equivalent to using "foreign goods to resist domestic goods." Another representative also stated: "If a great nation has something, I don't necessarily have to have it. If a foreign nation doesn't have something, why can't I create it uniquely?"

The First Review Committee meeting experienced two power outages. Representatives spoke in the dark, their voices heard but their faces unseen, resembling a movie theater during a power outage. Representatives from the Youth Party and the Social Democratic Party spoke very actively in the First Review Committee. Yu Jiaju, Min Da, Xia Erkang, Zhou Baosan, and others all spoke, explaining their respective parties' views on the draft constitution and making some concessions. The chairman of the meeting, Li Junfu, also a member of the Social Democratic Party, nearly stormed out of the meeting due to accusations from some representatives, but was persuaded to stay by Huang Shaogu, Chen Yiyun, and others. The atmosphere at today's meeting was indeed quite heated. Often, five or six hundred people simultaneously requested to speak, calling out their seat numbers, as chaotic as an auction house in Shanghai. Without Huang Shaogu's calm analysis, order would have been nearly impossible to maintain.

When the first article was put to a vote, Chairman Li Junfu read out the various proposals, but his voice grew softer and softer. The representatives raised objections, and Li said, "I am hoarse; my voice is already gone." However, his tone gradually became higher towards the end. A representative told a story in the meeting, saying: "Zhang Zongchang once advocated the Four People's Principles to counter the Three Principles of the People. His so-called Four People's Principles were the four classes of people: scholars, farmers, workers, and merchants." Everyone laughed after hearing this.

The Third Review Committee was chaired by Wang Shijie. Because the conveners, Pan Gongzhan and others, had done thorough and complete preparatory work, and Chairman Wang handled matters in an orderly manner, the meeting proceeded very smoothly. They discussed and voted on each article in a harmonious and cooperative manner, without wasting time or engaging in acrimonious disputes. It can be said that it was the most reasonable review meeting.

A cold wave from Siberia has arrived again. The water on the ground freezes in the mornings and evenings. Fires are lit in every meeting place, making it feel warm as spring inside. However, the plenary hall was neither heated nor equipped with radiators. The Second Review Committee, which met there in the morning, ended quickly. The Seventh Review Committee's Education and Culture Subcommittee, which met there in the afternoon, also felt cold and deserted. One proposal after another was passed, with few heated moments.

In the morning meeting of the Seventh Review Committee's National Defense and Foreign Affairs Subcommittee, He Guoguang and Leng Xin engaged in a fierce "struggle" over whether soldiers could join political parties. He said: "The army is the army of the nation. Since it cannot interfere in administration, it should be above factions." Leng said: "Soldiers are also citizens and should enjoy the freedom to believe in ideologies and exercise political power." As a result of the debate, the first half of Article 134 was not changed, and He was victorious.

During the afternoon discussion of Article 137, the proposed amendment to the constitution regarding foreign policy, two Catholic tycoons, Yu Bin and Pan Chaoying, stood out. Yu Bin, filled with the fervor of a religious leader, appealed for international justice on the one hand, opposing the use of power politics, and pleaded for the interests of 20 million overseas Chinese on the other, demanding that provisions to protect overseas Chinese be explicitly stated. Pan Chaoying, a scholar of international affairs, requested that the United Nations Charter not be rigidly stipulated in our constitution, so as to avoid constitutional amendments caused by modifications and changes in international law. As a result, both men achieved all their goals.

### The American China Policy Association Sternly Condemns Fan Xuande's Letter to Byrnes Requesting Denial of Fan's Statement That It Was Rude to Ambassador Gu and Should Apologize

[Central News Agency, New York, 9th] The American China Policy Association (Chairman is Powell) today released the full text of a letter sent by the Association to Byrnes on the 6th, requesting that the State Department deny the statement made by Fan Xuande, Director of the Far East Division of the State Department, on November 11 regarding China, and apologize for Fan's rudeness towards Gu Weijun. The letter stated: "Fan Xuande said that we believe it would be unwise to invest public or private capital in a nation or government that is corrupt, wastes resources excessively on armaments, is threatened by civil war, or has a government that intentionally despotic and wants to reject American merchants, or has no democratic ideas"! "This kind of irony can largely be applied to countries around the world today." "However, Fan Xuande's statement only specifies one country, that is, China." "However, there is something even more to be condemned, because when Fan Xuande made this statement, Gu Weijun, the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, was also present. Gu was unable to refute it on the spot, so he adopted an apparently unresponsive attitude. This is not a good American foreign policy, nor is it the traditional etiquette of the United States towards representatives of friendly countries." Fan's sympathy for the Chinese Communists and his statement, which completely match the policies stated by the Communist newspapers, are obvious. Fan may hope that the United States will stop all loans to the Chinese government, which we can understand, but when the State Department announced its policies and cooperated with its allies, Fan actually made this statement representing the State Department, which we cannot understand. Fan's statement will help create chaos in China. What's more, this statement will prevent the United States from ever lending to any country that violates Soviet policies. The Communist Party in these countries can always create the situation that Fan described, such as losing the civil war, nationalizing industrial countries, and military spending. If we accept this principle, we will inevitably not be able to lend to any country except those praised by the Soviet Union, or even the Philippines. In a letter to President Truman on September 6, the Association requested "reorganization of the Far East Division of the State Department, and that all important positions in the Division be held by those who fully comply with the American Open Door Policy." The Association bluntly told Byrnes: "After Fan was first appointed as the head of the China Section and then promoted to Director of the Far East Division, our long-term observation has convinced us that he does not have the above qualifications." The article concluded: "We only ask that Your Excellency (referring to Byrnes) publicly clarify, deny Fan's statement, and apologize to Gu Weijun for Fan's rudeness."

### Studying the Yellow River Management Plan - Savage and Others Scheduled to Depart for Inspection of the Entire Yellow River Course, Many Chinese Experts Accompany

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] The Supreme Economic Council, considering the extreme importance of the Yellow River problem, hired American experts in June of this year: Lieutenant General Le Baron, an engineer with the US Army Corps of Engineers; Dr. Savage, a consultant for the Reclamation Bureau; and Mr. Grothe, the chief hydraulic engineer of the Aluminum Corporation, to come to China this year to study and manage the Yellow River. The three American experts arrived in Shanghai on December 2 and are scheduled to depart from Nanjing on the 12th for inspection. Several Chinese experts will accompany them. They will take a China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) plane directly from Nanjing to Wei Yin, then travel along the Grand Canal to the Yellow River, then fly along the old course to Haikou for inspection, and then fly back along the old course to Kaifeng. On the 13th, they will fly upstream along the Yellow River from Kaifeng to Ningxia, stopping for one day to inspect the conditions of various canal projects.

### Issues Related to Elections in the Draft Constitution (Part 1)

— Our Reporter Yu Zhenji

Analysis of Proposals Submitted by National Assembly Delegates

The total number of written proposals submitted by the National Assembly delegates is about 400, of which cases 1 to 100 have been printed and distributed by the General Secretariat of the Assembly. This article briefly analyzes the 24 proposals related to elections in these 100 cases to see the hopes of the National Assembly delegates for the constitutional provisions related to elections.

The election issues that the representatives value most are: (1) the occupational electoral system, (2) increasing the number of border representatives in the regional representative system, (3) women's election and being elected, and (4) overseas Chinese electing supervisors and so on. Most representatives hope that the above four points can be expressly stipulated in the constitution to conform to world trends. Of course, there are also dissenting opinions on the above points, but the number is not very large.

(1) Occupational Representative System

The strongest advocates for the occupational representative system are Gu Zhenggang, Ma Chaojun, and Wang Xiaolai and other 528 representatives who proposed Case No. 98. This case lists the following reasons to explain the necessity of adopting the occupational electoral system: (1) Occupational representatives come from all walks of life and can represent the interests of various professional organizations and have a sense of supra-locality; (2) After regional representatives and occupational representatives are elected separately, the people who can best represent occupational consciousness can easily be elected by various industries; (3) Gathering representatives of different occupations from all over the country in one place is easy to achieve the effect of coordination. And it cites that when the National Father went north in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China (1924), he advocated that the National Assembly should adopt a system of occupational representative; when it was officially convened in the twentieth year (1931), it followed this claim and representatives were elected separately by national professional groups to participate in the formulation of the Provisional Constitution for the Period of Political Tutelage. The current National Assembly Representative Election Law, the County and City Council Organization and Election Regulations, and the County Councilor Election Regulations all adopt an occupational electoral system. According to past experience, the implementation of this system is beneficial and without disadvantages.

The case "National Assembly Preparatory Committee Draft Constitution Research Association Republic of China Draft Constitution Amendment", proposed by Zi Rui and other 218 representatives, also advocates the adoption of the occupational representative system.

Looking at the 100 proposals, there are eight cases mentioning occupations, of which seven cases agree to this system. The proposers are as many as 974 people (there are some overlaps), accounting for one-half of the total number of representatives, and the proposers Gu Zhenggang and Ma Chaojun are the heads of party and government agencies responsible for guiding the morning industrial and commercial professional groups, and Wang Xiaolai and others are also the chairman of the National Federation of Industry and Commerce. Other representatives are also mostly National Assembly occupational representatives, so they can represent the opinions and requirements of all farmers, industry and commerce. Other regional representatives have also signed to agree. This requirement of the public will definitely be realized.

The only opponent is Case No. 87 proposed by Wang Xuan and other 29 representatives. This case advocates that the National Assembly representatives should only be divided into regional representatives and overseas Chinese representatives, because the above two types of representatives have already included all the people and conform to the legacy of electing representatives by autonomous units to organize the National Assembly. They believe that occupational representatives are not seen in the legacy regarding the National Assembly. The National Assembly advocated in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China (1924) is another matter. In the 100 proposals published this time, there are five cases involving the number of border representatives, of which the most important are (1) Case No. 18 proposed by Bai Yunti and other 222 representatives, (2) Case No. 89 proposed by Huang Zhengqing and other 62 representatives, and (3) Case No. 59 proposed by Yang Zhizhong and other 20 representatives. Bai Yunti and Huang Zhengqing's proposals are for Tibet, and Yang Zhizhong is making demands on behalf of the indigenous peoples of various provinces.

Bai Yunti and others proposed that although the National Assembly. The Legislative and Supervisory branches list the Mongolian clauses, there are many omissions and they are not fully suitable, and should be supplemented. Regarding the electoral part, it is advocated that in Article 26, under "1. by various provinces and Mongolian leagues", add the four words "and special banners"; under "2. by various provincial councils and Mongolian leagues", add the four words "and special banners"; under "3. by the counties", add a "banner" character; the five words "and equivalent to counties" are changed to the four words "and its equivalent". The reason is that the area of ​​each league and special banner is equivalent to a province, and the area of ​​each banner is equivalent to a county.

The original number of Legislative Yuan members was "8 people in total from the Mongolian leagues", but Bai and others advocated changing it to "30 people in total from the Mongolian leagues, departments and special banners". The reason is that there are 13 leagues and departments in total, and there are special banners that do not belong to the leagues and departments. The area of ​​each league and department is very large. If it is set to 8 people, there will be less than one person per league and department, which is too few. Furthermore, the status of the league and department is the same as that of a province. The province with the smallest population has 5 members of the Legislative Yuan. It is not too much to increase the total number of Legislative Yuan members from the league and banner to 30. The number of supervisors is also proposed to increase from 8 to 17.

Huang Zhengqing and others' proposal intends to clearly stipulate in the constitution the National Assembly representatives, Legislative Yuan members and supervisors that the Tibetan region under the province should elect. It is advocated that in Article 26 of the draft constitution, the words "and Tibetan areas under the province" should be added under "Tibet" in each paragraph. In addition to the original 8 Tibetans in the Legislative Yuan, "8 Tibetans under the province" are added, and 8 supervisors are also added.

The reason is that the "Tibetan region" generally refers to the front and back Tibet. In fact, there are Tibetan people living in certain places in Gansu, Sichuan, Qinghai, Kang, and Yunnan provinces, with a total population of more than 3 million people. However, these Tibetan areas cannot be included in the so-called Tibetan region, and there are no explicit provisions in the constitution for elections and voting rights in various provinces, so this proposal is made. Another case with a similar nature to this case is the proposal of Yang Zhizhong and other 20 people, suggesting that the indigenous peoples of Yunnan, Sichuan, Guizhou, Kang, Hunan, and Guangxi provinces should be allocated National Assembly representatives and Legislative Yuan members and supervisors in proportion to the population.

Regarding the proposals of Bai Yunti and others, the representatives of the provinces of Chahar, Suiyuan, and Ningxia believe that the above provinces are currently treating Mongolian compatriots quite favorably, and it seems that there should be no other regulations. (To be continued)

Editorial

### Please Do Not Close the Door to Peace Talks!

Since the National Assembly convened to draft a constitution, the people of our country have sincerely hoped that the Assembly can create a practical and feasible democratic constitution, laying a solid foundation for democracy and the rule of law in our country. However, they still eagerly hope that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party can reopen peace talks, so that this special phenomenon of one side convening to draft a constitution while the other fights and sheds blood can end as soon as possible, and a genuine peaceful resolution can be achieved. Therefore, after the opening of the National Assembly, we, the common people, still hold a heart of urgent expectation for the reopening of peace talks, especially closely watching Special Envoy Marshall's trip to Beiping and Tianjin. Because Special Envoy Marshall has the determination to overcome all difficulties in mediating the Kuomintang-Communist issue, when the Communist representative Zhou Enlai left Beijing to return to Yan'an, he had concrete and specific suggestions to pass on to the Yan'an authorities to explore the possibility of reopening peace talks. Marshall, with great patience, waited for the CCP's reply, and only received Zhou Enlai's reply a few days ago. The content of the reply was very simple: the CCP put forward two preconditions for reopening peace talks: one was to dissolve the National Assembly, which was in session to draft a constitution, and the other was to restore the positions of both sides' troops when the ceasefire order was issued on January 13 of this year.

After receiving this reply, Marshall naturally felt that the possibility of reopening peace talks was slim. Even to us ordinary people, it is known that the CCP lacks sincerity in reopening peace talks, and the government has no room to accept the two conditions proposed by the CCP. Therefore, everyone felt extremely disappointed and believed that the CCP had decided to fight to the end militarily, seemingly unafraid of any sacrifice. This spirit of bravely fighting internally is indeed brave, but how can we, the common people, endure the performance of this great tragedy after twenty years of bloodshed! Fortunately, the government still adheres to its consistent position. On the 9th of this month, Chairman Chiang reported at the National Government Memorial Week, stating that in addition to expressing that the two conditions proposed by the CCP could not be accepted, he solemnly declared: "The government has never closed the door to peace talks and has consistently advocated a political solution to domestic problems, waiting for the CCP to participate in peace talks and reorganize the government at any time." These words are nothing less than the gospel of peace, rekindling a glimmer of hope for the prospects of reopening peace talks. The government sincerely hopes for peace and consistently advocates a political solution to domestic problems, which is indeed the most powerful guarantee for a peaceful resolution of national affairs. At the same time, according to the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the government is currently considering a plan to send important officials to Yan'an to make a final effort for domestic peace; and the voices for Zhang Qun, Wang Shijie, and Shao Lizi are the highest for the selection of important officials. If this plan is not opposed by the CCP and can be realized, it will be of great benefit to the reopening of peace talks and can be regarded as a turning point in the long-stalled peace talks. Therefore, the people of the whole country are looking up to Nanjing, eagerly hoping for the realization of this plan.

However, what is the CCP's attitude towards this plan? Initially, they remained silent and refused to comment. Only the day before yesterday late at night, they suddenly announced to the press the news that the National Army had begun to attack the Yan'an area, and emphasized that the six regiments of the National Army under General Hu Zongnan had penetrated thirty miles into the "Gansu-Shaanxi-Ningxia Border Region," calling this the largest offensive in the attack on the Yan'an area. The intention of the CCP spokesperson Wang Bingnan in releasing this shocking news is nothing more than to prevent us, the common people, from foolishly expecting the reopening of peace talks. Yesterday, Wang Bingnan spoke again, saying that the government's plan to send personnel to Yan'an was a kind of "peace offensive" adopted by the government. Yan'an can never express its agreement. According to this, although the government has opened the door to peace talks and is ready to reopen peace talks with the CCP at any time, the CCP has closed the door to peace talks again.

Therefore, we, the common people, must recognize the crux of the failure to reopen peace talks. The responsibility for this should be borne by the CCP, which is self-evident. What is valued in the third party is that it can transcend all partisan prejudices and adhere to its spirit of impartiality and selflessness, seeing clearly what is right and wrong, and distinguishing clearly between black and white. Therefore, in the current issue of responsibility for the failure to reopen peace talks, there is no room for ambiguity and there is a need for investigation.

Although we have no personal experience in party politics, we still have the insight to witness the political evolution of advanced democratic countries. We always feel that the Chinese Communist Party cannot be compared with ordinary political parties in advanced democratic countries. In advanced democratic countries, any party's competition is based on its domestic and foreign policies. We have never heard the CCP clearly announce its policies, and what it is arguing about is the issue of territory. We would like to say a few honest words to the CCP: Today, the people of the whole country are eager for peace and democracy. The task of the National Assembly is to formulate a practical and feasible democratic constitution, and it has no other role. In addition to the Kuomintang, there are also social elites, the Youth Party, and the Democratic Socialist Party present. This is the first step for our country to move towards democracy and the rule of law, and it is also an indispensable first step. The CCP's demand to dissolve the National Assembly is not only completely unreasonable, but also violates the public will of the people across the country who yearn for democracy. This is the first point. In order to realize domestic peace, the people have to earnestly request the reopening of peace talks day and night, but the territorial issues of any party are not what we, the common people, are concerned about. Using this as a condition for reopening peace talks, from our people's point of view, there is no sufficient reason. This is the second point. While the CCP is publicizing and claiming that the National Army has begun to attack the Yan'an area, on the other side, the Communist Army is launching offensives on various fronts. Not only is Yulin surrounded by the Communist Army, but Baoding has also become a besieged city. The Northeast Communist Army is also very active in the ice and snow. The so-called facts speak louder than words, and it is extremely difficult for the world to believe the CCP's propaganda offensive. This is the third point.

In short, things have come to this point, we are still foolishly hoping that both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party can lay down their guns, stop fighting and bloodshed, and reopen peace talks so that domestic problems can be resolved politically. We, the common people, are really too eager for peace. Especially under the current circumstances, whether for the sake of the people or the country, internal strife cannot be allowed to recur. Therefore, we have to advocate peace first, without dwelling on the past, without talking about gains, as long as the Kuomintang and the Communist Party can reopen peace talks, we will never express despair and firmly believe that human conscience and common sense will prevail. May the leaders of both sides be determined to make a painful decision and make good use of their wisdom, especially the CCP, not to close the door to peace talks, and strive to turn conflicts into reconciliation for the country and the nation, leaving a glimmer of hope.

### Professors from Universities in Beiping and Tianjin Request Prompt Improvement of Treatment, Submitting Suggestions to the Chairman, Executive Yuan, and Ministry of Education

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 9th] Professors from Peking University and Tsinghua University believe that after enduring hardship in Kunming during the Anti-Japanese War, their lives must be stable after victory in order to contribute to academic and educational endeavors. Their current treatment is insufficient to maintain even the lowest living standards, let alone education and research. The professors from the two universities recently submitted a recommendation with over 150 signatures, and professors from Nankai University, upon hearing the news, have also come to Beiping to sign. The recommendation has been copied into three copies and submitted to the Ministry of Education, the Executive Yuan, and Chairman Chiang. The main points of their recommendations include: first, requesting a reasonable standard of living that meets the minimum living needs; second, ensuring fairness, as rice prices in Beiping and Tianjin are three times higher than in Nanjing and Shanghai, while treatment is one-third lower, and the income of state-owned production enterprises in Beiping and Tianjin far exceeds that of the education sector. Furthermore, presidents of national universities in Beiping and Tianjin also jointly telegraphed the Ministry of Education last month, requesting improvement of the treatment of teachers in the Beiping-Tianjin area.

### A Large Iron Ore Deposit Discovered in Liaoning Province

Reserves Exceeding Those of Anshan and Benxi

[United Press, Tianjin, 10th] This newspaper reports today that iron ore deposits have recently been discovered in Tonghua and Huanren in Liaoning Province. The reserves exceed the total reserves of Anshan and Benxi, and the mining area is eight times larger than Anshan and Benxi. It is estimated that it can produce 400 million tons of iron, as well as tens of millions of tons of coal, which will occupy an important position in China's industry and national defense. The Anshan iron mine has been abandoned after being occupied by Soviet troops and destroyed by the Communist Army. Therefore, the discovery of the Tonghua and Huanren iron mines is even more important.

### Arson Case at Old Taoist Temple in Beiping Adjudicated by the Court Yesterday

All the defendants were returned to the detention center.

### UNRRA Reduces Shipment of Medical Supplies, CNRRA Sends Personnel to the United States to Negotiate, Requesting Allocation of Easier-to-Collect Items

[This newspaper report] The UNRRA authorities previously stipulated that some items in the medical supplies shipped to China were not easy to collect, so they reduced the shipment of medical supplies to China by one-seventh. According to UNRRA's announcement, a total of 30,000 tons of medical supplies and equipment were shipped to China. As of the end of October, CNRRA had received about 5,000 tons in total. After the reduction, the actual amount will be more than 3,400 tons less than expected. Calculated in US dollars, the value of the originally allocated medical supplies was US$41 million, which will be reduced to US$34.7 million.

After obtaining this information, the Department will send Liu Ruiheng, chairman of the Department's China Medical and Health Business Committee, to Washington this week to contact the UNRRA authorities and request a delay in the reduction and will request the allocation of easier-to-collect items.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 9th] UNRRA Director LaGuardia reported to the UNRRA Council today that as of November 18, UNRRA had shipped 119,611 English tons of supplies to China, worth approximately US$211.8 million, accounting for 44% of the total amount to be shipped.

### Zhejiang Provincial Government Decides to Implement the Policy of Wealthy Counties Assisting Impoverished Counties, Earmarking a Percentage of Business Tax Revenue for Overall Planning

[This newspaper, Hangzhou, 10th] The Zhejiang Provincial Government previously received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance, hoping that in order to achieve balanced development of political affairs in various counties, a percentage of tax revenue from wealthier counties would be earmarked to assist impoverished counties. The 1481st meeting of the Provincial Government Committee decided that 30% or 20% of the business tax collected by each county and city should be earmarked to assist impoverished counties. Specifically, 30% will be earmarked from Hangzhou, Yin County, Shaoxing, Yongjia, Jiaxing, Hai Ning, Wu Xing, and other seven counties and cities with higher collection amounts, and 20% will be earmarked from Pinghu, Yuyao, Lanxi, Jiashan, Hang County, Jinhua, Huangyan, Ruian, Wenling, Pingyang, and other ten counties. The funds will be deposited in the provincial treasury on a monthly basis for overall planning. Telegrams have been sent to the relevant counties and cities to handle the matter.

Shaoxing residents have repeatedly appealed, and it is now learned that Tax Bureau Chief Chen has been dispatched to Hangzhou to inspect and will go to Shaoxing, Ningbo, Jinhua, and other places to supervise taxation in the near future.

[This newspaper, Hangzhou] The Hangzhou City Council, at the beginning of conscription in Hangzhou City in October, was aware that conscription in Hangzhou City was still the first time and was afraid of disturbing the people's hearts and affecting social order. It had a thorough discussion with the municipal government on the method of enlisting volunteer soldiers. Volunteers who joined the army would be given a resettlement allowance by the government, and the Bao chief would solicit 10,000 yuan from each conscriptable young man within the Bao to raise a "Bao Min Preferential Gold" of 1 million National Currency. However, it was feared that this decision would hinder national laws or cause malpractices during the solicitation process, so it was delayed. Recently, it has been learned that the municipal government has followed the military service laws under the "fair" and "just" principles and ordered each district to select two people from each Bao and report them to the municipal government for verification by the 15th of this month. The municipal government held a military service review committee meeting at 3:00 p.m. on the 9th and decided to allow those on the publicly announced list of applications for exemption or postponement who meet the application standards but whose documents and procedures are unable to be legally prepared to apply for review early.

As the news spread, the gallery became even more crowded. The court president Ju Xuanguan appeared in court to pronounce the sentence. Li Shengwu was carried into the court by a bailiff. The court briefly asked his name and then pronounced the sentence: "Li Shengwu is sentenced to death for murder, deprived of political rights for life, and sentenced to 16 years of imprisonment and deprived of political rights for 10 years for two counts of attempted murder.

Other parts are not guilty." After hearing the sentence, Li was initially miserable and silent, then gave a wry smile. After the sentence, he was ordered to be returned to detention. Then, Li Qinlu, who was related to Li's case, was brought in. Li bowed his head and said nothing, only admitting his guilt and swaying, seemingly extremely uneasy. The prosecutor read the indictment, and the defendant's defense lawyer made a favorable defense. President Zhou immediately pronounced the sentence: "Li Qinlu is sentenced to seven months of imprisonment." Li Qinlu was returned to detention. The case of the sensational thief Li Shengwu has come to an end.

### Huangyan Honey Tangerines Come on the Market in Season, Tangerine Orchards Stretch as Far as the Eye Can See, with an Annual Output of 60 Million Jin, The First to Be Transported and Sold to Shanghai Were the Tian Tai Shan Farmers

— Taizhou News · Our Correspondent Shen Bo

Huangyan honey tangerines, the only special agricultural product of Taizhou, are now coming on the market in season. Because the honey tangerines produced in Huangyan have a sweet, fragrant taste, they are indeed a fine product among fruits, so they are famous far and wide. In order to understand the situation of the Huangyan tangerine industry, this reporter took the Jiangda steamer from Taizhou and arrived at Huangyan County. As the ship entered the Sanjiang Estuary, I saw golden tangerines hanging on the green tangerine trees on both banks, stretching for dozens of miles as far as the eye can see. This is a natural scenic tangerine orchard.

According to a Mr. Xu, a tangerine merchant, the first person to transport and sell Huangyan honey tangerines to Shanghai was the calligrapher Mr. Liu Wenjie (号 Tian Tai Shan Nong). At that time, because the honey tangerines were transported to Shanghai for the first time, they could not be sold for a while. In order to sell them, he came up with the idea of using the famous Mount Tian Tai as a tangerine name, calling it "Tian Tai Honey Tangerine". The tangerine trees are planted on the Hua 项 Mountain Peaks, etc. However, soon Huangyan honey tangerines gradually became popular at sea and sold very well, so even now, many tangerine merchants still use this "Tian Tai Honey Tangerine" as a well-known brand for sales.

The total area of tangerine tree planting in the county is about 13,000 mu, and there are more than 13,800 tangerine-growing households. The planted fields cover more than 50,000 mu, with more than 1.5 million tangerine trees planted. The annual output is more than 60 million jin, of which early tangerines account for more than 70% of the county's tangerine production, and vermilion tangerines account for 20% of the total production. Among the county's agricultural products, besides rice, the tangerine industry accounts for the largest share. The annual income is quite large, and the economy of Taizhou's rural areas is also revitalized. Although the region suffered from drought and typhoon disasters during the summer and autumn of this year, the tangerine production was not reduced. Now that the early tangerine market has opened, the price is more than 70,000 yuan per 100 jin, but because sales are weak, the price has gradually fallen to about 60,000 yuan.

There are more than ten varieties of tangerines planted. The six more productive varieties are briefly introduced below:

(1) Early tangerines, also known as honey tangerines on the market, have yellow skin, a fragrant smell, a larger size, and mature the earliest. They are harvested and eaten between September and October and are the earliest-developing variety of tangerines.

(2) Local early tangerines also have yellow skin, which is thicker than early tangerines. They have a very sweet taste and a lot of juice. They are the best variety of tangerines, and the "Tian Tai Honey Tangerines" sold in Shanghai are this fine fruit. They can also be stored for a long time without rotting and mature between November and December.

(3) Milk tangerines are the young ladies among tangerines. The fruits are smaller than early tangerines, with thin skin and luster. They have a clear, sweet taste, and the fruit skin has a special aroma.

(4) Vermilion tangerines have red skin, different shapes and sizes, and very rough skin. They are the rough product among tangerines. They taste very sour when first picked, so it is not advisable to eat them early. Only when other tangerines start to stiffen in the first month of the new year does the sour taste of vermilion tangerines turn sweet.

(5) 　　The fruit is larger than other tangerines, with thick and rough skin and a slightly bitter and sour taste. It is the latest-maturing variety of tangerines. Harvesting only begins in mid-to-late December, and when stored until February or March of the following year, its taste turns sweet and juicy.

(6) Baozi tangerines are the Washington navel oranges produced in the United States. They were imported from Japan in the early years of the Republic of China. They have few seeds, a lot of juice, and the sweetest taste. Their quality is better than local early tangerines. There are also Shantou seedless tangerines, mandarin oranges, yellow-skinned tangerines, Fujian tangerines, and kumquats, but the production is not large.

For planting methods, during the winter plowing each year, the soil is first piled up into mounds in the field, four to five feet in diameter and two to three feet high. Broken pottery pieces are buried at the bottom of the mounds to prevent the tangerine tree roots from extending deep into the soil. In the following spring, saplings are transplanted onto the mounds. After fertilization, irrigation, soil cultivation, pest control, and pruning, they can bear fruit. If the tangerine trees are to be healthy, the fruits that grow must be picked off early, before they mature, to prevent the dispersal of nutrients. Generally, it takes seven years before there is a return. During each winter season, it is best to pile up river bottom silt for cultivation. If the cultivation is appropriate, good fruit can still be produced for 60 to 70 years. However, fertilization must be based on the variety and age of the tree. Newly planted saplings should be given more frequent fertilization, with less fertilizer each time, twice a month. When the tangerine trees reach the fruiting stage, fertilization should be done two or three times a year.

Huangyan honey tangerines have a wide market. The major sales destinations are Shanghai, Ningbo, Hangzhou, Suzhou, Nanjing, Wenzhou, Lishui, and various commercial ports along the Yangtze River. During the War of Resistance, due to transportation obstacles, the tangerine industry plummeted. Many tangerine farmers converted the planted tangerine fields into rice fields. After the victory of the War of Resistance last year, shipping between Shanghai and Taizhou resumed, and ships sailed regularly between the two places. As a result, tangerines could be sold smoothly to other places. As all goods rose in price, tangerine merchants and tangerine farmers all made several times their profits, grinning from ear to ear. The packaging for export has also been gradually improved. In order to avoid being crushed and rotten during transport, the bamboo baskets have now been replaced with boxes. As a result, the consumption of Huangyan wood materials has also increased.

For rented business premises, the rate shall not exceed 10% of the annual rent; for owner-occupied business premises, the rate shall not exceed 12‰ of the current value of the premises. For rented residential premises, the rate shall not exceed 5% of the annual rent; for owner-occupied residential premises, the rate shall not exceed 5‰ of the current value of the premises, etc. (Omissions). Upon investigation, the housing tax currently levied by the Municipal Finance Bureau is calculated based on the rent from 1937, divided into three categories A, B, and C, multiplied by 2,000 to 1,000 times respectively. A total of 20% is added for military tax, and another 20% is added for municipal construction tax, totaling 40%, which is a harsh tax unprecedented in ancient and modern times, both domestic and foreign. Citizens have listed reasons and sent letters to the North China Daily News and the Continental Daily News, etc., strongly objecting. Some believe that the current municipal administration is worse than during the enemy-puppet period, some believe that collecting harsh taxes is no different from violent robbery, some believe that collecting harsh taxes is fraudulent, and some believe that collecting harsh taxes is no different from sucking the people's blood. The public is indignant, expressing public opinion and advocating immediate improvement, which is commonly seen by readers. Now that the National Government has clearly stipulated the tax rate, the Shanghai Municipal Government should immediately comply. For uncollected housing tax, the amount should not exceed the limit stipulated in the Housing Tax Regulations. Therefore, the payment forms for housing tax and municipal construction tax should be uniformly canceled by the Finance Bureau. I hereby request that your newspaper publish this letter in the Reader's Column so that the public may know it. Sincerely, (Lawyer Lu Xingyuan)

### The Constitution Endows Citizens with Health

Editor: The National Assembly representatives Hu Ding'an, Zhu Qi, Wu Zhimei, Hu Xuanming, Guo Zuyuan, Wang Ziji, Chen Jixian, Yang Dopu, etc. proposed to add a special article on promoting national health to the basic national policy of the Constitution. Its content is quite commendable. As far as I know, the wording of the article is "The state shall actively promote public health and improve national health." The reason is "We believe that the health of the people is the foundation of national strength. Since the European War, most countries in the world have included the protection of people's health in their constitutions. Articles 120 and 122 of the Soviet Constitution are the most obvious examples. After the outbreak of World War II, countries such as the United States, Britain, and France further recognized health as the wealth of life. The health of the people is the resource of the state. Therefore, the Atlantic Charter clearly stipulates freedom from want. And the Health Act announced by Britain in March of this year and the New Declaration of Human Rights in France have all been designated as special chapters of the Constitution. Even the recent Constitution of Japan stipulates that the people have the right to live a minimum standard of living that is healthy and cultural. The health of the people in our country is not up to the standards of several countries. At the beginning of nation-building, if we do not determine the national policy of promoting national health, then no matter how perfect the politics are, it will be difficult to achieve the goal of economic construction due to the lack of human strength. To protect the health of the people, we must vigorously implement public health in order to achieve the purpose of protecting the health of the people," etc. It is worthy of attention. I hope to publish it in the newspapers to advocate it together. (Reader Leng Xiaoyuan)

### Q&A on Raw Silk Loans

Reply to Zhang Naihong: Regarding the various points raised in your letter about government-sponsored raw silk loans, the United Management Office of Spring Silk Loans in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui has replied: "(1) The original letter stated that "the issuance of loans to small silk factories is particularly delayed, even up to 20 days or more, so that the silk loans are still under review, and the factory has experienced strikes due to unpaid wages." Upon investigation, this office is an institution jointly established by the bank and the China Silk Corporation. All loans have separate regulations. According to the regulations for this year's spring silk cocoon loans, each manufacturer should transport the raw silk to Shanghai and store it in a warehouse, obtain a formal warehouse receipt, and submit it to the Commodity Inspection Bureau for qualification. After obtaining the inspection certificate, they can apply to this office for silk cocoon loans. The handling of warehousing, inspection, and other procedures takes considerable time and is not a special delay in the issuance of loans to small silk factories. The responsibility for unpaid wages and strikes lies with the factory owner and is a separate matter from the loan and cannot be confused. (2) The original letter stated that "large factories or those with close connections to the company can receive payment based on the 'transport company's' bill of lading, regardless of whether the silk has been reeled well." Upon investigation, this office, in view of the time-consuming nature of the aforementioned regulations, has consulted with the Central Bank and temporarily allowed the waiver of the inspection certificate, instead relying on the warehouse receipt and inspection report to approve the loan. Furthermore, the transport of raw silk to Shanghai often involves delays due to the difficulty in finding warehouses. To meet the urgent needs of manufacturers, the manufacturers are allowed to have the bill of lading stamped by this office and stored in a warehouse on their behalf, and loan procedures are processed simultaneously. All of these repeated improvements are to streamline procedures and facilitate manufacturers. Regardless of the size of the silk factory, the procedures are handled uniformly, without any favoritism. (3) The original letter stated that "The reorganization of the Shenxi Gongcheng Transportation Co., Ltd. was forced by the fact that the goods could not be delivered in time." Upon investigation, the Shenxi Gongcheng Transportation Company has not had any instances in the past where the goods could not be delivered in time. Its internal reorganization is not related to the loan. The corresponding explanation is hereby given for your information." Specially delivered.

### Student Parents Protest Assigned Donations

It has been reported that on October 29, Nanjing Electricity wrote, Chairman Jiang telegraphed to fellow countrymen across the country to conserve manpower, material resources, and financial resources. Regarding donating to build schools, paper should be freely donated, and absolutely no amount should be stipulated, which is close to assigning. Today, the country is not yet peaceful, and fellow countrymen are in deep pain. All levels of government personnel and fellow countrymen across the country should deeply understand this kind of keen instruction and stop them all. Unexpectedly, the seven children of this humble person are studying at a certain middle school and a certain elementary school (three middle schools and four elementary schools). The amount is still stipulated, with 60,000 yuan for each person, and 30,000 to 20,000 yuan, totaling 280,000 yuan, ordering children to raise donations separately. Not only are there clear orders from the distant words, but also giving immature children a bad influence. This is not the case for this humble person alone. All student parents in our province are like this. Relatives and friends tell each other that they are all heartbroken, and they all say that this is far from the purpose of parents educating their children. Children are ignorant and are forced to donate everywhere because of the school's threat. All relatives are public servants who are deeply distressed, and they are often glared at by others. They don't know a word and cry bitterly when they go home. This kind of strange phenomenon is actually done by someone who dares to do it without scruples. What is his heart! It is really confusing. The people of the country have always been good at profiting from opportunities. I didn't expect that the authorities of a few schools in Fuzhou could collect money with such skill that they could rival the so-called school shops. It's magical and amazing! This humble person has served in the customs for twenty-two years, abiding by the law, being honest and self-disciplined. In the July 7th Incident, I was working at the Sandu Customs, and I felt that the national crisis was imminent. I voluntarily donated and contributed all the five liang of goldware stored in my home to the Central Finance Committee of Nanjing through Mr. Chen 　英, chairman of the Fujian Provincial Party Department and chairman of the Anti-Enemy Relief Association (the event was published in the Fuzhou Fujian Minbao Lin Sitao donated a large amount of gold and silverware). I hope that victory will come, but after a year, the treatment of public servants is meager, and it is difficult to support the seven sons and two daughters. Education is even more costly. I use the strength of borrowing from the future to cultivate children and make them useful talents in society. As a result, it has come to this! My heart is hurt when I see it with my own eyes, so I hereby send a letter on behalf of student parents in the province. I hope that the school will stop students from raising donations immediately, and those who are unable to raise donations should not be discriminated against, so as to preserve the vitality of the country, educate the future, and benefit the future of the country immensely. (Lin Sitao of Fuzhou)

### Forthcoming Meeting of the Four Foreign Ministers Scheduled for Next Spring in Soviet Capital; Molotov Puts Forward Concrete Proposals on German Issue

[Special Dispatch from Our Correspondent in New York, 10th] The four major powers' foreign ministers have recently agreed that the next foreign ministers' conference will be held in Moscow starting March 10th next year, to draft the German peace treaty, and to allow news reporters from various countries to freely report on the conference proceedings. According to reports, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov requested last week that the next foreign ministers' conference be held in Moscow. During the talks held last night by the four powers, U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes expressed his agreement with this proposal, but first asked whether Mr. Molotov would permit news reporters to freely report on the conference proceedings. Mr. Molotov replied that he was willing to follow the precedents of the two previous foreign ministers' conferences in Paris and New York and grant the press the same convenience. However, Mr. Molotov intends to reserve his response until Tuesday regarding Mr. Byrnes' plans to reduce the Allied occupation forces in Europe and to immediately convene a foreign ministers' conference to study the German issue.

[Dispatch from Agence France-Presse, New York, 9th] U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes, acceding to Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's request, held talks with him today for an hour. According to political observers, Mr. Molotov is expected to present several concrete proposals aimed at achieving an early conclusion to the German peace treaty. Meanwhile, official announcements confirm that the four foreign ministers have decided to hold the next meeting in Moscow on March 10th next year. Tonight's meeting of the four foreign ministers discussed the agenda for the upcoming Moscow meeting, including a proposal to appoint representatives to prepare for the Moscow meeting. Mr. Molotov opposed this proposal, requesting time to consider it, but agreed that the four foreign ministers should instruct their representatives to review the drafts proposed by the United States, France, and the Soviet Union regarding the agenda. French Foreign Minister Bidault seized this opportunity to state France's views on certain points. Mr. Bidault stated that France hoped the German border issue would be discussed first, but ultimately agreed to consider the report of the Allied Control Council for Berlin first. Mr. Bidault also proposed changing the wording in the U.S. proposal discussing the "future provisional and permanent government of Germany" to "Germany's provisional political institutions under the control of the four powers," to which Mr. Byrnes agreed. A decision was then made to discuss the issue of the foreign ministers' representatives' preparatory meeting. Mr. Molotov expressed his opposition, arguing that before the four powers determine Germany's borders, if the foreign ministers' meeting were to hear the territorial claims against Germany from several European countries, it might provoke a strong reaction from Germany. Mr. Bidault concluded by explaining France's views on the Saar issue, but it was not discussed at the meeting. The four foreign ministers will meet again tomorrow, at which time Mr. Molotov is expected to make a final decision on the foreign ministers' representatives' meeting.

[Dispatch from Reuters, Paris, 9th] Semi-official sources report that Yugoslav Foreign Minister Simić has asked France to inform the foreign ministers' conference that Yugoslavia wishes to participate in the upcoming foreign ministers' conference to discuss the German and Austrian issues, as Yugoslavia is a country with a direct interest in the German and Austrian peace treaties. In a letter to French representative Bidault on December 4th, Mr. Simić strongly emphasized Yugoslavia's concern for the economic and territorial provisions of the German and Austrian peace treaties.

[Dispatch from Reuters, New York, 9th] France's draft agenda for the next foreign ministers' conference was submitted to the secretariat yesterday. The United Kingdom has not yet formally submitted a draft agenda, presumably because it believes that the drafts already submitted by the Soviet Union, France, and the United States are sufficient for discussing the formal agenda. The points in the draft proposed by France are as follows: (1) Future borders of Germany; (2) Measures to control European security (based on the U.S. draft previously submitted for the four powers to supervise Germany's disarmament); (3) France's proposals regarding the Ruhr and Rhineland regions; (4) The Allied Control Council's reports on disarmament, repatriation, elimination of Nazism, reparations, and economic unification, central institutions, and provisional political organizations; (5) The outline of permanent German political institutions; (6) The purge of Prussia; (7) The report of the coal experts committee (decided at the foreign ministers' conference in Paris this summer); (8) The outline of the German peace treaty; (9) The outline of the Austrian peace treaty and related matters; (10) Restrictions on occupation forces within Europe.

### UN Political Committee Eliminates Disputes, Drafts Universal Disarmament Proposal; Indian Proposal Passes, Including Three Points; Disarmament Control Agency Independent from Security Council

[Dispatch from the United Press, Lake Success, 9th] The disarmament proposal review committee of the UN Political Committee today eliminated disputes over the disarmament issue, effectively completing the preliminary drafting of a universal disarmament plan. This is a victory for France, Egypt, and India. These countries promoted the inclusion of a clause in the disarmament plan stipulating that troop withdrawals from foreign countries by the relevant countries should be considered when discussing disarmament steps, and that the issue of a UN guard force should be considered. The dispute was resolved due to the following two reasons: (1) General Assembly President Spaak, impatient with the continued debate, asked the delegates to stop wasting time on irrelevant issues. (2) British representative Shawcross asked the delegates to consider the newspaper criticism of the meeting and urged the delegates not to become a laughingstock. Initially, the debate over the French and Egyptian proposals was inconclusive. Finally, it was merged into the Indian proposal, and at the suggestion of the Brazilian representative, it was divided into three parts for a vote, which passed. The first part stated that the General Assembly, recognizing the close relationship between the security issue and the disarmament issue, proposed that the Security Council strive to expand the application of international guards as stipulated in Article 48 of the Charter. The second part proposed that governments implement gradual and balanced withdrawals of their troops stationed in non-enemy territories. The third part suggested that motorcades stationed within member states' territories should be withdrawn as soon as possible. This clause was proposed by Egypt, and the United States advocated for its amendment, stipulating that troops stationed abroad according to existing treaties should be an exception, which was passed by a vote.

[Dispatch from Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 9th] The UN General Assembly's disarmament subcommittee resolved tonight that the agency responsible for supervising international disarmament should operate independently from the Security Council. Although Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky refused to clarify whether the veto power would not be applied to this agency, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov had previously indicated that the veto power only applies within the Security Council.

### Political Committee Rejects Motion to Sever Relations with Spain; Amendment Calls for Recall of Ambassadors to Spain

[Dispatch from the United Press, Lake Success, 9th] The UN Political Committee today passed Belgium's proposal on the Spanish issue with 27 votes to 7, with 16 abstentions. The proposal recommends that all member states immediately recall their ambassadors and ministers from Spain under Franco's leadership, with embassy affairs to be managed by chargés d'affaires. If a democratic government has not been established in Spain within a reasonable period, the Security Council should consider further appropriate measures. This proposal is less drastic than the one proposed by the subcommittee, which advocated that member states individually sever relations with Franco, but was rejected a few minutes earlier by a vote of 20 to 20. A proposal submitted by China to prohibit the United Nations from purchasing grain from Spain was also rejected.

[Dispatch from Agence France-Presse, Marseille, 10th] A demonstration was held here last night demanding Spanish independence and non-interference from foreign countries. Demonstrations will be held throughout the country today, and shops in the planned demonstration areas will be closed to prevent unforeseen circumstances. This morning, all newspapers featured news of last night's demonstration on their front pages, claiming that 700,000 people participated, severely protesting the UN's attitude. However, neutral observers believe that the number of participants was exaggerated.

### Stalin Retreats Behind the Scenes, Soviet Policy Undergoing Transformation; Recent Concessions to Britain and the United States, Whether Expedient Measure Remains Uncertain

[Dispatch from the United Press, New York, 9th] The Soviet Union's policy towards the United States and Britain has recently become more moderate. Western diplomats believe there are four reasons for this, the main one being the preparation for Soviet leader Stalin's less active role in governance. Whether Stalin is old and infirm and unable to cope is a matter of speculation, but it is well known to diplomats here that Stalin has retreated behind the scenes in recent months, with Molotov and other key figures in charge of everything. Therefore, it can be concluded that even if Stalin is not ill, he has already become a prophet and philosopher of Soviet communism, rather than a hands-on leader. The power center in Moscow is shifting. In other words, if external problems of the Soviet Union can be easily resolved, then its internal problems will also be easier to handle. From the perspective of British and American diplomats, the Soviet Union's recent softening of its stance at the UN and the four-nation foreign ministers' conference is the main driving force. In addition, there are three other reasons: (1) The Soviet Union is deeply concerned about the United States possessing the atomic bomb, and its most important diplomatic goal is to find ways to prohibit its use and subject it to international control. (2) Domestic construction has a direct impact on a large portion of the Soviet people and is always of greatest concern to the Soviet authorities. On the one hand, it needs to obtain more reparations from Germany, and on the other hand, it needs to obtain U.S. financial and technical assistance, which requires a more friendly international relationship. (3) The political failures of communist parties in Europe and other countries have caused the Soviet authorities to feel a significant degree of disappointment. For example, in the elections in Eastern European countries, although the communists had Allied military police as their backing, they still failed to secure a victory. Even in France, they did not achieve complete victory. In addition to the above reasons, the firmness of U.S. foreign policy seems to have had a considerable impact. However, whether the Soviet Union's recent concessions represent a genuine change in its policy, enabling it to permanently work together with Western countries, or are merely a temporary expedient to overcome domestic difficulties, remains to be answered.

### Standardization of Armaments, Britain and the United States Have Exchanged Views

[Dispatch from Reuters, London, 9th] Lord President of the Council Morrison said in Parliament in response to a question from Labour Party member Piratin that there had been no formal decision regarding the standardization of British and American armaments, but that weapons had been exchanged within a large scope during the war. There is still this cooperation between British and American occupying forces in Germany today. Therefore, for the sake of economy and efficiency, informal exchanges of views on the issue of weapons standardization have inevitably taken place.

### French National Assembly Holds Third Round of Prime Ministerial Elections

[Dispatch from Agence France-Presse, Paris, 9th] The French Fourth Republic Senate is holding re-elections, which have not yet been completed. The Assembly is scheduled to hold a third round of voting tomorrow to elect a Prime Minister. Observers here today are trying to estimate the final distribution of seats in the Senate. The Senate will have a total of 315 members, 214 of whom were elected yesterday (including 200 from mainland France and 14 from French Algeria), with 101 more members to be elected.

### Combination of Chinese and Western Music, Appreciated by Parisians

[Dispatch from Agence France-Presse, Paris, 10th] The Chinese delegation to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) held a concert last night to entertain the delegates to the UNESCO conference. The program included a piece composed by the head of the delegation, Zhao Yuanren, sung by Miss Ge. The melody blended traditional Chinese music with Western music in a unique and interesting way, and the audience was full of praise.

### Iranian Elections Imminent; Central Army Enters Azerbaijan Province, Occupies Many Towns Without Resistance

[Report from Our Agency] London, 10th Broadcast: Iranian government troops are currently advancing along the southern border of Azerbaijan Province, having entered the province and advancing towards the provincial capital, Tabriz. Government troops have destroyed border defenses and occupied twelve towns.

[Dispatch from Reuters, Sri Lanka, 10th] A spokesman for the Iranian General Staff said that government troops entered Azerbaijan Province yesterday without encountering any resistance. Some democratic soldiers in Azerbaijan Province surrendered after a brief battle. Government troops entered from Qazvin and advanced 50 miles into Azerbaijan Province to Mianeh, which has already captured Faraj Quch, a city strongly defended by democratic soldiers. Meanwhile, Idris Sultana informed Javid, the Governor of Azerbaijan Province, that government troops entered Azerbaijan Province to supervise the holding of general elections and hoped to follow government orders, facilitate the implementation of government tasks, and maintain security and good order.

[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, New York, 9th] The UN Economic and Financial Committee held the last meeting of the current General Assembly today, passing a compromise proposal on relief matters after the termination of UNRRA, and finally resolving the international issues with many disputes. According to the recommendation of La Guardia, the outgoing Director-General of UNRRA, a special technical committee will be established to organize a new agency to replace the International Emergency Food Fund Committee. The Special Technical Committee will consist of Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, France, Poland, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union. The chairman of the Economic and Financial Subcommittee later decided that the amount of contributions from member states would not be specified, but rather only urged each member state to assist in completing relief matters when and where relief is needed next year. Some representatives in today's committee stated that this method cannot reflect the international principles guiding UNRRA's various activities, nor can it achieve complete international cooperation. However, given the United States' refusal to support international relief agencies after the termination of UNRRA, this may be the only practical compromise.

[Report from Our Agency] San Francisco, 10th Broadcast: The 48 member states of UNRRA expect that the agency's Director-General, La Guardia, will soon submit his resignation, but still advocate continuing UNRRA-style relief, and recommend establishing a $400 million emergency food relief fund.

[Dispatch from Reuters, Washington, 10th] Authoritative sources say that UNRRA is scheduled to hold its sixth, and final, board meeting here today. Director-General La Guardia is expected to announce his resignation at that time.

### Lewis Case to be Retried

Supreme Court to Open Next Month

[Dispatch from the United Press, Washington, 9th] The Supreme Court today approved the government's request for an expedited judgment on the coal miners' strike case and agreed to decide the issue of whether foremen can organize unions, which is of great importance to John L. Lewis, President of the United Mine Workers of America. Although the strike has ended and most workers have returned to work, the Supreme Court still allowed the government to appeal and legally resolve whether the injunction issued by Federal District Judge Goldsborough was lawful. The case is now scheduled for argument on the 14th of next month and can be ruled on any Monday thereafter, approximately before the April 1st deadline, as Lewis indicated when he ordered 400,000 miners to return to work last Saturday that a possible strike might resume on or after April 1st. As for the issue of foremen organizing unions, it was a major obstacle in Lewis's negotiations with private mine owners for a new contract. The mine owners decided not to make concessions until the Supreme Court ruled.

### Smuts Arrives in London Today, Emphasizes Relations Between India and the Soviet Union; Indian Assembly Applauds the U.S. Constitution; British House of Commons to Discuss the Indian Issue

[Dispatch from Agence France-Presse, London, 9th] South African Prime Minister General Smuts arrived here by plane this afternoon from New York. He declined to comment on the world situation, only saying: "I will stay here for two or three days and then depart for South Africa." According to informed sources, General Smuts will hold talks with British Foreign Office officials. The main topic of discussion will likely be the issue that the Indian delegation in the UN General Assembly and the Soviet Union, Byelorussia, Ukraine, Yugoslavia and other countries have maintained a close "joint" relationship. According to diplomatic observers, the Slavic group and the Indian representatives always take the same position whenever the issue of the South African Federation is raised, especially when accusing South Africa of racial discrimination, indicating that there is a close joint relationship. Therefore, diplomatic circles here attach great importance to this matter and the South African Federation's request to merge with Southwest Africa, especially given General Smuts' visit to Britain. In addition, informed sources told this agency's reporter that at a time when the British-Indian negotiations in London have failed, making the situation in India more delicate, the "joint policy" adopted by the Soviet Union and India is particularly noteworthy.

[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Washington, 9th - United Press] British Foreign Secretary Bevin, accompanied by British Ambassador to the United States Inverchapel, called on President Truman today and met with the new U.S. Ambassador to Britain, Gedney. Regarding the Palestine issue, Truman reiterated his support for the partition plan.

### Fifth Anniversary of the Pearl Harbor Incident; World Situation Still Unstable; Atomic Bomb and Biological Warfare Threaten Peace; People Still Not Relieved from Fear of War

— Translated by this Newspaper's Translation Department from an Original United Press Article by Miller

On this day of eternal remembrance, the fifth anniversary of Pearl Harbor, war remains the greatest fear in the world. For many people, peace is still that old cliché, flickering like a will-o'-the-wisp.

We fought in Europe for more than nineteen months. The war in the Pacific lasted for sixteen months.

But the lingering trends of calamity are now greater than anything humanity has ever seen, because the Second World War produced two weapons: the atomic bomb and biological warfare. According to scientists, they can destroy human civilization.

New Terror

A new terror and the atomic bomb were brought to Earth together on August 6th and 8th, 1945, at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. But it wasn't until several months after the war ended that the world began to realize the extent to which another new terror, biological warfare, had developed.

If this type of warfare were to be completed and applied, the size of the death zones would be measured in continents. With other weapons, including atomic bombs, the destructiveness is only regional. The fear and suspicion that were budding among the nations united in the desperate war against Germany and Japan took root and fueled the development of these new weapons.

At the same time, although the major war has passed, small wars are still going on. In many parts of the world, the peace that came on May 8th and August 14th, 1945, seems very unpleasant, simply not peace at all.

Since the end of the great war, there has been no peace in Palestine and China.

The blood flowing in the mountains along the Greek border is as red as that shed on any battlefield in World War II.

Guerrilla fighters who died in the jungles of Luzon after the peace are just as dead as the Filipinos who died on Bataan Peninsula and Corregidor.

Another War

Even in countries where blood is no longer being shed, peace seems to be just another kind of war. We have witnessed strikes in the United States, unfree elections in small European countries, and famine and misery in Italy and Denmark.

The countries that launched the war have all been defeated. Japan, which launched a shocking attack on Pearl Harbor in the United States on December 8th, 1941, and caused the war to begin.

Her bombs and torpedoes nearly wiped out the U.S. Pacific Fleet, which made it possible for Malaya and Singapore, the Philippine Islands and Indonesia, and the Southwest Pacific Islands to be recaptured without resistance.

Japan was finally defeated three years, eight months, and seven days after the Pearl Harbor incident. Her fleet was sunk, and major cities were destroyed. Hiroshima and Nagasaki were devastated by a kind of violence that had never been seen in the universe since the beginning of time.

Hopeless for Peace

Germany's surrender was three months earlier than Japan's. Following the war against Germany, the only real hope for peace to this day has been created — the United Nations organization.

But the hope in the hearts of most people is now less bright than it was in the summer of 1945, when the United Nations was just born in San Francisco. The Allied military occupation has only had no major problems in Japan.

During the Second World War - the establishment of a peaceful work - the politicians dedicated to it - seemed too daunting.

Since its birth, the United Nations has - experienced all the congenital - of babies, - and has also suffered all - the difficulties.

The almost non-stop arguments between Eastern and Western allies seem poised to doom the United Nations to an early death when the time is right. Deep-rooted disputes between large and small countries have also plagued it. Sullied by greed, terror, and hatred, the United Nations often looks like it is dying.

Are these just the normal illnesses of a young child? Will the United Nations finally grow into a glorious youth, and let us see it reach adulthood? This human effort is still in progress. Politicians say they believe they can make the United Nations do things.

On the other side of this, we also have the stumbling blocks created by biological warfare and the atomic bomb. (Translated by Shan Fengyu)

### Japan Plans to Request Reduction in Reparations; U.S. to Adopt a More Lenient Attitude; Japanese Reparations Agency Being Established

[French News Agency, Washington, 9th] Regarding the future level of Japanese industry, sources here have stated that the United States will allow Japan to maintain a higher level of industry, slightly exceeding that stipulated by U.S. Reparations Commissioner Pauley. [United Press, Tokyo, 10th] Japan appears to be conducting an organized campaign to reduce reparations. It has been learned today that the Japanese government will request a reduction in the Pauley reparations plan, arguing that the plan would bankrupt Japanese industry.

[Reuter's News Agency, Tokyo, 10th] To implement reparations, the Japanese government established a Reparations Council last year. Recently, a Reparations Countermeasures Department was established within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and a Reparations Department was established within the Rapid Termination of the War Affairs Bureau to serve as a liaison with the Allied forces. Additionally, a Reparations Implementation Cooperation Council was established within the Ministry of Commerce and Industry to serve as an administrative body for reparations. In June, essential guidelines for the handling of reparations factories to be dismantled were determined, and a Reparations Dismantling Law was drafted, which is expected to be submitted to the current Diet session. Local reparations councils will also be established in various local agencies to oversee the dismantling work. It is reported that the production equipment for reparations, totaling 12 million tons, will require 170 million cubic feet of timber, dismantling costs will amount to 3.5 million to 4 million yen, and the process will take one year.

### Commercial Air Route to be Opened Between the United States and India

[Special Dispatch from the United New Company, Washington, 9th] Transcontinental & Western Air (TWA) of the United States is scheduled to open a commercial air route between the United States, Palestine, and India in January of next year. The flight from Washington to Bombay will cover 9,000 miles and is expected to take 42 hours and 40 minutes, with stops in New York, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, Karachi, and other locations. The total ground time is estimated to be 10 hours.

### Artificial Snow Experiment Successful

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] The China Natural Science Society reports: The recent successful artificial snow experiment conducted by American scientist Schaefer at the Schenectady airport is a major victory in humanity's conquest of nature. Schaefer, at the General Electric Company's scientific research laboratory, discovered that snowflakes formed when microscopic particles of dry ice were added to supercooled, moist air. Based on this theory, Schaefer recently conducted a large-scale artificial cloud experiment at the Schenectady airport. He ascended into the clouds by plane and dispersed six pounds of microscopic dry ice particles into the sky. Shortly thereafter, snowfall was observed in the clouds. The latent heat from the condensation caused turbulence in the cloud layer, ultimately leading to snowfall. According to Schaefer, only one microscopic particle of dry ice is needed to produce several tons of snow after falling 2,000 feet.

### China and India (Part 1)

— By Nehru

Translated by Zhou Xiangguang, Our Correspondent in India

China and India have become increasingly connected and developed close relationships due to the spread of Buddhism. Whether this initial connection between China and India occurred as early as the reign of Emperor Ashoka is unknown. It was only when items such as silk were frequently transported from China that maritime transportation developed. However, in the earliest periods, there must have been people traveling and land transportation routes, as the people along the eastern border of India resemble the Mongol race. This is even more evident in Nepal, and is also commonly seen in the provinces of Assam and Bengal. History tells us that Ashoka's missionary work was widely promoted, and as Buddhism spread in China, travelers and scholars traveled between China and India for over a thousand years. They traveled by land, crossing the Gobi Desert and the mountains and plains of Central Asia, and crossing the Himalayas—a long and difficult adventure. It is unknown how many Chinese and Indian travelers braved this route. According to some, 90% faced dangers along the way. Many people, upon reaching their destination, did not want to return and settled there. But there was another route, though less safe, which was shorter. This was by sea, through Vietnam, Java, Sumatra, Malaya, and the Nicobar Islands. This was a commonly used sea route, but sometimes travelers would come by land and return by sea. Buddhism and Indian culture spread throughout Central Asia and parts of Indonesia, where many monasteries and academic research institutions existed. Thus, travelers from India or China traveling by land or sea had places to stay and rest upon reaching their destination. Sometimes, scholars coming to India from China would first study Sanskrit for some time in the Indian colonies of Indonesia before arriving in India.

The earliest recorded instance of Indian scholars arriving in China is that of Kāśyapa Mātanga, who arrived in China during the reign of Emperor Ming of the Han Dynasty, perhaps at the invitation of Emperor Ming. Kāśyapa Mātanga established himself in Luoyang, accompanied by the Indian scholar Dharmarakṣa. Later Indian scholars who came to China included Kumārajīva and Bodhidharma. Each of them had several monks and disciples. It is said that in the sixth century AD, there were three thousand Indian Buddhist monks and over ten thousand Indians residing in Luoyang.

These Indian scholars not only brought many Sanskrit scriptures to China and translated them into Chinese, but also wrote scriptures in Chinese. Their work greatly contributed to Chinese literature, including poetry. Kumārajīva arrived in China in 401 AD. He was a prolific writer and left us forty-seven types of scriptures. He translated the works of the great Indian philosopher Nāgārjuna into Chinese. Later, Jñānagupta went to China in the mid-sixth century AD. He translated thirty-seven original Sanskrit scriptures into Chinese. His great knowledge was so revered that the emperor of the Tang Dynasty in China became his disciple.

There were both land and sea routes between China and India, and several Chinese scholars went to India. Among the most famous, and whose travelogues survive to this day, are Faxian, Xuanzang, and Yijing. The monk Faxian came to India in the fifth century AD, and he was a disciple of Kumārajīva. When Faxian left his teacher for India, his teacher told him something very interesting. Kumārajīva told Faxian that when he arrived in India, he should not only spend all his time on religious knowledge, but also study the lives and customs of the Indian people, so that China could understand the whole situation of India. After arriving in India, the monk Faxian studied at Pāṭaliputra University.

Among the Chinese scholars who went to India to study Buddhism, the most famous was the monk Xuanzang. He came to China in the seventh century AD, during the height of the Tang Dynasty in China and the reign of King Harsha in North India. Xuanzang traveled by land, passing through the Gobi Desert, Turpan, Kucha, crossing the Pamir Mountains, crossing the Himalayas to India. Xuanzang told us about his adventures along the way, and about seeing many Buddhist rulers and monasteries in Central Asia, as well as the worship of Buddhist monks by the Turks. Xuanzang traveled all over India, and in every place he went, he was worshipped and respected by the local people. He carefully examined the local people and local conditions, and recorded everything he heard. He lived at Nālandā University for many years. (Translator's Note—According to Huang Chenghua's History of Chinese Buddhism, he stayed for five years). Nālandā was also not far from Bodh Gaya. At Nālandā University, he was able to conduct many kinds of academic research and get along with students from far and wide. It is said that there were about 10,000 monks living permanently at Nālandā University at that time. Xuanzang obtained a degree in law from this university and later became the vice-chancellor of the university.

Xuanzang's book, Records of the Western Regions, is a book that one never tires of reading. He came from a country with a high level of culture, at a time when Chang'an in China was the center of art and literature, so his articles describing the situation in India are of great value. He told us about the educational system and progress of Nālandā University after its establishment, and listed five courses for students: (1) Grammar, (2) Crafts, (3) Medicine, (4) Logic (today輯), (5) Philosophy; he was also admired by most Indian students. Some elementary education was very developed, and monks and teachers became teachers. Regarding the people, he said: "Although the character of ordinary people is frivolous, they are upright and loyal. They are extremely honest in matters of money. They also consider the fairness of their actions; their behavior is not fraudulent or dishonest, and what they say or promise is truthful. The laws established by their government are very fair, and their behavior is very gentle and kind. Crimes and thefts are very few; however, sometimes they do occur." He further said: "The government's administrative facilities are built on the principles of benevolence, and the things done are very simple, and the people do not belong to power. Therefore, in this regard, the taxes levied on the people by the government are very light. Merchants are busy with business affairs."

Xuanzang returned to his country along the same route through Central Asia, carrying a large number of scriptures. From his recorded books, it is recorded that Buddhism had great influence in Khurasan, Iraq, and Mosul, and even to the borders of Syria. At this time, Buddhism gradually declined in those places and in the Islamic world; but at the same time it had spread to Arabia, and soon spread throughout this land. Regarding the people of Iran, Xuanzang made an interesting observation: "They do not pay attention to the way of learning, but they can completely devote themselves to art work. They often profit from neighboring states."

Iran's past and future have been devoted to the beautification and expansion of life, and this situation has influenced the rest of Asia. Turpan is a small, unfamiliar kingdom on the edge of the Gobi Desert. Xuanzang told us about it, and in recent years, thanks to the efforts of archaeologists, we have gained a lot of knowledge. The culture here is a hybrid culture formed from the inspiration of Chinese, Indian, Persian, and Greek literature and art. Its language is one of the Indo-European languages, taken from India, Iran, and some similar European Celtic languages; religion was also transmitted from India, its way of life belongs to China; and some works of art were transmitted from Iran. The murals and sculptures of the Buddha and the male and female gods are beautifully made, and the statues often have Indian robes and Greek headdresses. According to Groset, "These goddesses are a happy crystallization representing the gentleness of Hinduism, the emotions of the Greeks, and the charm of Chinese women." After Xuanzang returned to his motherland, he was welcomed by the Tang emperor and the people, and decided to devote himself to writing and translating the scriptures he brought back from India. When Xuanzang began his journey from China many years ago, a story was passed down that the Tang emperor held a handful of mud powder in a cup and gave it to Xuanzang, saying: "You must drink it well, because I have told you that a handful of soil in your homeland is worth more than ten thousand taels of gold in a foreign country."

Xuanzang's visit to India was highly respected by the people of both China and India, and further established the political relationship between the rulers of China and India. At that time, King Harsha of Kanyakubja in North India and the Tang Emperor of China sent envoys to each other. Xuanzang himself remained in India, exchanging letters with his friends or collecting scriptures. There are two very interesting letters, originally written in Sanskrit, preserved in China. One of them was from the Indian Buddhist scholar Prajñadeva to the Dharma Master Xuanzang in 654 AD. After inquiring about the news of his friends and their literary work, he went on to say: "We are now sending you a piece of white cloth, expressing that we have not forgotten you. The road back is long, and we hope you do not mind this small gift and that you can accept it. Regarding the Sūtras and Śāstras collections, we believe that you will also need them, please give us a catalog, and we are willing to copy one for you to use." Xuanzang said in his reply: "I recently heard from the envoys returning from India that the great teacher Śīlabhadra has passed away. The news made me so sad that I could not carry on. As for the books in the two scripture collections, I have brought them all back, and have already translated the Yogācārabhūmi-śāstra and other thirty volumes of scriptures into Chinese. However, I must now tell you that when I passed through the Kōu Dú River, I lost a large number of sacred scriptures. I have attached a catalog of these scriptures. I ask you, if you have the opportunity, please give me a copy. I offer some short articles as gifts, and I hope you will accept them."

### Trial Opens for the Zang Da Er Zi Case; Three Rickshaw Pullers Testify to the Events; Next Hearing to Confront the Murderer; Deceased's Brother Demands 140 Million in Compensation; Instigator Lai Ling Nai Returned to Custody After Questioning

[Our Dispatch] The case of rickshaw puller Zang Da Er Zi (Zang Yaocheng) being fatally injured by American soldier Roderick, instigated by Spanish sailor Lai Ling Nai, was prosecuted by the District Procuratorate after being reported by the deceased's brother, Zang Haicheng, according to law. The American soldier Roderick, who committed the assault, is being handled by the US military authorities according to law. The case opened in the Criminal Division of the District Court yesterday afternoon, with Lai Ling Nai being questioned, who denied the charges vehemently. Witnesses Chen Xuedong, Ren Xiaozhu, Mao Guifu, Liao Yuanshou, and the plaintiff Qi Haicheng were questioned. The answers of the witnesses differed quite a bit under individual questioning. There were several American soldiers in the audience. The court adjourned for another hearing. The murdering American soldier will be summoned to court next time for confrontation.

Lai Ling Nai looked old, with gray hair and a damaged right heel, wearing a dark blue woolen coat, a yellow khaki shirt underneath, yellow khaki pants, and black leather shoes, holding a grass-green canvas cap. He answered questions in Spanish, which were translated into English and then into Mandarin. He stated: He is 57 years old, Spanish. He is a sailor on the American merchant ship Morris. He first arrived in Shanghai on August 27th and stayed on the ship. On September 22nd, at around 4:30 PM, he went to the Seamen's Club and went out alone at around 10:00 PM, taking a rickshaw to the Huadu Dance Hall, paying the rickshaw puller one US dollar, and then went inside. He drank two or three bottles of beer, each costing US$1.25. After waiting for a while, he wanted to return to the ship. After going out, he was surrounded and pulled by many rickshaw pullers, including the rickshaw puller who brought him. He did not argue with him, only that he wanted to pull him. When he went out, an American soldier in blue uniform came out, whom he had not seen while drinking, and did not know the name of the American soldier. As for why the American soldier hit the rickshaw puller, it was because the rickshaw pullers were fighting to pull and tug, and the American soldier was also drunk at the time. By the time the rickshaw puller fell to the ground, he had already left three or four steps away. The court asked, "When you argued with the rickshaw puller, you called to the American sailor, 'Friend, come and help me.' Did you say this in the prosecutor's office?" Lai replied, "I would not say that."

### Four Witnesses Questioned; Liao Yuanshou First to Describe the Incident

Immediately after, the questioning of witnesses began. Liao Yuanshou was questioned first. Liao stated: He works as a tricycle driver and does not know Zang Da Er Zi. On the evening of September 22nd, at 9:00 PM, he was waiting for business at the entrance of the Anle Palace Huadu Dance Hall. Zang Da Er Zi was already there when he arrived. At 9:30 PM, Zang told everyone that a foreigner with a bad eye took a rickshaw here and went inside without paying. He asked everyone to take care of it when he came out. When the Spanish man came out, he was seen by another tricycle driver, Zhao Adi, who called out to Zang Da Er Zi. Zang followed to ask for money. The old man (referring to Lai Ling Nai) pretended to be drunk, swaying back and forth, and refused to pay. The two pulled and tugged, walking east. At this time, an American sailor came by tricycle and got off in front of the Anle Palace, but did not go inside. The old man called "Friend." I knew it was a friend. The two talked for a few sentences, which I did not understand. At that time, the old man and Zang Da Er Zi were still pushing and pulling. The old man punched Zang. When Zang got close to the American soldier, the American soldier raised both hands and punched Zang in the right temple area, and Zang fell to the ground. After the incident, the two perpetrators walked east, but were surrounded and stopped by passers-by. Later, a car came with four or five American soldiers on it. The two perpetrators got into the car, but Chen Xuedong grabbed the steering wheel and refused to let it drive away. Later, MP and SP cars arrived. The old man got into the MP car, and the American soldier got into the SP car and went to the police station.

### American Soldier Punches, Falls to the Ground

Dong Xuedong stated: He works as a rickshaw puller and is a cousin of Zang Da Er Zi. He arrived at Anle Palace at 8:00 PM on the afternoon of September 22nd, waiting for business, and left only when the fight occurred. Zang pulled the Spanish man here at 10 o'clock, but he did not go upstairs to pay the fare immediately. More than ten minutes later, the Spanish man and an American sailor came down shoulder to shoulder. Zang followed to ask for the fare. The Spanish man did not pay. The American sailor let go, the Spanish man fell, and the American sailor punched Zang in the chest. Zang fell to the ground and fainted. Later, two jeeps came, and the American soldier was taken back to the American military headquarters, while the Spanish man was taken to the police station in another car. I saw the Spanish man come to hit.

### Ren Xiaozhu's Testimony

Ren Xiaozhu stated: He works as a tricycle driver. On the night of September 22nd, he arrived at the entrance of Anle Palace at about 10:00 PM. Around 10:30 PM, Zang pulled a rickshaw over, and the old man in the rickshaw did not pay the fare. More than ten minutes later, the old man and an American soldier came out together. Zang went forward to ask for the fare. The old man ignored him. They pushed and pulled each other. Later, the old man said a few words to the American soldier. The American soldier wanted to pull Zang Da Er Zi away. Zang refused to leave. The American soldier punched Zang in the chest. Zang fell to the ground and fainted. The two then went east.

### Police Officer Mao Guifu Speaks

Mao Guifu stated: He is police officer number 5912 of the Huangpu Branch. On the day of the incident, he was the first police officer to arrive at the scene. When he arrived, Zang had already been helped up and was leaning against the wall. He immediately notified the bureau by phone to send a car. Later, two American military jeeps came. The Chinese military police on them told us to go to the police station together, but one of the cars carrying the American soldier did not go, only the car carrying the Spanish man went to the bureau.

### Re-questioning Liao Yuanshou on Qingdao Incident

The court then questioned Liao Yuanshou about being invited by the American military to go to Qingdao. Liao stated: He was invited by a Chinese man surnamed Zhu to inquire about the details of the incident on the fourth floor, room 409, number 2 Beijing Road, and asked if he could go to Qingdao. After he agreed, he was taken to the American Consulate to get a passport and quarantine certificate. At 9:00 AM on October 16th, he took an American military plane to Qingdao from Jiangwan Airport. In the days after arriving, he was taken to military ships several times to be questioned. The American soldier who committed the assault was on one of the ships. During this time, he was asked if he could help the American military speak. He replied that he would say what he saw and do what was convenient. Until 12:00 PM on October 19th, he took an American military plane back to Shanghai. Others thought he had taken money from the American military, but he had not taken any money. When he went to Qingdao, he promised to compensate him for 20,000 yuan per day for the loss, but after returning to Shanghai, he went to claim it several times, but it was delayed and not paid, so he did not want it.

### Incidental Civil Suit; Demanding Compensation

Zang Haicheng, the deceased's brother, stated: He is 38 years old and is a cleaner. Zang Da Er Zi is my elder brother. There are only two brothers. The deceased only left behind a daughter named Genbao, who is 14 years old. He also filed an incidental civil suit demanding compensation for losses. Zang's lawyer, Chen Zhen, stood up and read the contents of the petition, requesting the defendant Lai Ling Nai to compensate for (1) funeral expenses of 8.704 million yuan; (2) loss of the victim's income, based on the deceased's daily income of 20,000 yuan, calculated from the actual age of 42 to the age of 60, totaling 131.4 million yuan; (3) consolation money for the bereaved family of 5 million yuan. The total of the three items is 145.104 million yuan. It was stated that if the American soldier Rott, who committed the crime, were to pay compensation in the future, Lai Ling Nai could be allowed to pay a reduced amount proportionally. The court instructed that the American soldier perpetrator would be sentenced by the American military, but a civil claim for compensation could be attached to the American military through diplomatic channels. The lawyer replied that he had submitted a document to the Ministry of Justice requesting it to handle it. At this point in the trial, the court ordered that the case be adjourned for another hearing, and the American soldier would be summoned to court for confrontation next time. Lai Ling Nai then declared to the court that the charges were unfounded and requested bail, which the court did not grant, and ordered him to be returned to custody.

### Professor Roper Receives Reporters to Discuss the Tasks of the British Council

[Our Dispatch] Professor Roper, the British Council's representative in China, and his wife arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday to take charge of the preparatory work for the Shanghai branch. He specially received reporters at the Cathay Hotel at 3:30 PM yesterday afternoon to report on the tasks of the Council and the progress of the preparations.

Professor Roper stated: The Council has been established for ten years. In 1942, Dr. Joseph Needham, a famous scientist from Cambridge University, and others visited China to prepare for the establishment of the Sino-British Science Cooperation Office, which has close cooperation with various schools in the mainland and provides great assistance. The British Council's office in China has its headquarters in Nanjing, establishing contact with various schools and cultural institutions in Nanjing, and establishing a reference book library there. At the same time, a branch is set up at No. 27 Bund, Shanghai. Its main task is to distribute British books, magazines and other materials to universities and educational institutions throughout China. The Council also plans to establish a branch in Peiping soon and hold a library branch in Guangzhou.

The Council also provides various scholarships for Chinese university graduates and professors to study in the UK, but due to the current lack of places in the UK, it has to be slightly restricted, admitting 20 university graduates each year, who are selected by a selection committee jointly organized by the Chinese Ministry of Education, the Sino-British Educational and Cultural Fund Committee and the Academia Sinica. There are quotas for various subjects. At the same time, it will select the same number of Chinese government scholars, and the British Industrial Association will provide them with opportunities to go to the UK to inspect factories and industries. In addition, the Council will also send a small number of university professors to the UK to study British education, life, society, books, administration and local administration. In addition, the sculpture exhibition held by the Council will be open to the public at the Great New Company starting next week.

### Fu Wen's Reception for the Press Reports on the Whole Story of the Disaster Caused by Military Supplies, With Over 28,000 Artillery Shells Lost, and the Exact Cause of the Fire Still Unknown

[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding the First Branch of the Second Ordnance Depot of the Jiangwan First Supply District of the Joint Logistics Headquarters, where the explosion occurred on the afternoon of the 7th of this month, after days of efforts by firefighters to reduce the heat with Shanghai water, the explosions have completely stopped since yesterday during the day. Fu Wen, Commander of the First Supply District, will lead his subordinates to the scene of the accident at 9:00 AM this morning to continue excavation and cleanup, and will invite reporters from various newspapers to visit together.

At 4:00 PM yesterday, Commander Fu, in order to clarify the details of this disaster and the handling process to all sectors, specially held a detailed report at the headquarters for the press in this city. The following is a record of his entire speech: (1) Overview of the warehouse: Its name is the First Branch of the Second Ordnance Depot of the First Supply District of the Logistics Command. The location is the oval-shaped track and field at the Jiangwan Stadium (now called the Sports Ground). (2) Time of the fire: 1:15 PM on the 7th of this month. (3) Location of the fire: Warehouse No. 7 next to the west commanding platform of the track and field.

Measures Taken After the Fire

(4) Measures Taken After the Fire: After receiving a report from warehouse chief Chuan Jimin at 1:20 PM, the following measures were immediately taken: 1. Telephoned Chief of Staff Tan of the Garrison Command to dispatch a fire brigade for rescue. 2. Dispatched a company of soldiers to the fire site for security. 3. Instructed the head of the Ordnance Department, Mao Shenghua, to take emergency measures immediately. 4. Notified all other warehouses and the Transportation Brigade under its jurisdiction to implement martial law. 5. Notified Commander Wu Shi Xuan by telephone. 6. From 2:00 PM onwards, he went to the scene of the accident to work with the local police station to find ways to rescue. 7. After inspecting the scene of the accident for an hour, he returned to the headquarters and reported to Commander-in-Chief Huang of the Joint Logistics Headquarters by telephone. 8. Telegraphically instructed the head of the Ordnance Department to detain Wang Renlan, the head of the First Branch, but Wang had disappeared in the chaos, and Wu Rubiao, the warehouse officer in charge, had also fled. Wang's wife, Ye Suhua, and Wu's wife, Zhao Shengtang, were detained. Wang's wife had just arrived in Shanghai on the 6th of this month. Warehouse chief Chuan Jimin was still at the scene to rescue. 9. From that afternoon to midnight, he visited the accident site four times. Due to the violent explosions, the fire brigade was unable to force its way to put out the fire. At that time, he also telegraphed the Garrison Command to request the US Air Force to send planes to drop fire extinguishing bombs, but it happened to be Saturday afternoon, and the US military was on holiday, so it could not be realized. (5) Range of the fire: From the southern end of the west commanding platform to the gate of the east commanding platform, exactly half of the entire warehouse.

The Reason is Still Unknown

(6) Cause of the Fire: After consulting with relevant parties on the afternoon of the 8th, warehouse chiefs, warehouse soldiers, transport soldiers, and four officers and soldiers from the First Sub-station of the Zhejiang Supply Bureau were summoned (according to the sub-station, more than 10,000 hand grenades were sent, with one officer and four soldiers escorting them, one of whom had already died). Also interrogated the wives of the escaped branch chief and warehouse officer, and villagers. According to the injured transport soldiers Luo Debiao, Chen Chunji, and Yuan Mingcai, the escort soldier of the Zhejiang Supply Bureau, who were the last to leave the warehouse, after they had handed over all the ammunition and retreated, the receiving warehouse worker Rao Xingwang and the escort sergeant platoon leader Zhu Weizhang were still inside, sorting things out all day. They had just boarded the truck a few steps away from the warehouse door when they heard continuous explosions. From this, it is speculated that the hand grenades exploded due to improper handover. However, the exact cause is still pending further investigation in conjunction with the Garrison Command, the Garrison Headquarters, and the Logistics Headquarters.

Investigation of the Number of Losses

(7) Number of Losses: All were ammunition received from the enemy and puppet regime, of which the usable parts included 10,730 hand grenades, 6,310 75mm mountain artillery shells, 19 Japanese Type 10 illumination bombs, 83 flare bombs, 109 signal flares, 9,043 Japanese Type 89 heavy grenade discharger rounds, 83 one-kilogram smoke canisters, 96 Type 94 smoke tubes, 103 Japanese Type 10 detonators, 43 Japanese Type 1 ignition tubes, 78 meters of slow-burning fuse, and 645 fire extinguishing bombs. The scrap parts included 8,721 82mm mortar shells, 11,490 75mm mountain artillery shells, 3,896 French-style 77mm blank cartridges, 45 tons of miscellaneous rifle and machine gun bullets (approximately 28,000 bullets per ton), 1,099 miscellaneous artillery shells, 18 empty boxes of 30-second fuses, 11 small anti-electric appliance replenishment boxes, 33 150mm grenade heads, 580 Japanese Type 92 77mm bullet plates, and 1,500 safety plug covers. Also, one three-ton six-wheeled truck (number 02757).

In total, there were 28,515 usable and scrap mortar shells and mountain artillery shells.

Re-examination This Morning

Investigation Process: From 4:00 PM on the 8th, military and police organs and subordinates were gathered to summon officers and soldiers of the branch warehouse and injured escort soldiers for separate individual interrogations, which ended at 11:00 PM late at night. All stated that the explosion started in the warehouse, and hand grenades exploded continuously in an instant, causing the fire. On the 9th, an inspection was made at the scene of the accident, and the wreckage of a truck was found next to the west commanding platform, with two charred bodies beside the truck and inside the warehouse. It is now scheduled to conduct a thorough investigation again on the morning of the 11th. In addition, on the morning of the 8th, personnel were sent to the Army Hospital to investigate, and three artillery soldiers and four transport soldiers from the 146th Brigade were found to be injured. As for the civilian houses near the warehouse, there was no damage except for shattered glass windows.

Rushing to Handle the Aftermath

(9) Aftermath Measures: 1. Sent warehouse chief Fu Jimin to supervise and lead officers and soldiers to clean up the remaining bullets and debris at the bombed site and tidy up other nearby warehouses. 2. Requested the fire brigade to extinguish the remaining fire. 3. Detained the wives of the escaped branch chief and warehouse officer and investigated the introducers and guarantors. It was found that these two people have shady backgrounds, so it is believed that they fled in fear of punishment and will not have other functions. 4. Warehouse chief Chuan Jimin was released on bail, with Deputy Director of the Ordnance Department Deng Guangze as the guarantor. 5. Appointed Mao Qifang as the acting branch chief. 6. The loss list was urgently drawn up overnight, and drawings were made and reported to Chief of Staff Chen of the Ministry of National Defense and Commander-in-Chief Huang of the Joint Logistics Headquarters for the record. 7. Sent soldiers to repair doors and windows in various places. 8. Continued to send officers and soldiers to investigate the damage to nearby civilian houses. 9. Continued to investigate the cause of the accident.

### Responsible Personnel, Submitted for Punishment

(10) Responsibility: From the responsible warehouse officer, branch chief, general warehouse chief, up to the responsible section chief, director, and himself, all should be subject to joint punishment, and will be submitted to superiors for disciplinary action.

Finally, Commander Fu also expressed his feelings, saying that this city has no military storage facilities. The track and field was originally a storage warehouse for the Japanese. After the victory, a large number of munitions from various places were received. The warehouses were not enough. Although a request was submitted to build more than 20,000 tons of warehouses, it could not be realized due to excessive costs. We had to accommodate as much as possible in the existing warehouses. Everything was not ideal, and there were not enough talents and transportation vehicles, resulting in this disaster. I am extremely sorry for disturbing all the people of Shanghai. Fortunately, with the assistance of all sectors, it was calmed down in a short period of time, and I am especially grateful.

### A Pair of Little Wealth Gods Extorted 50 Million, The Case Cracked at Hongqiao Road, The Hostage Found in Danyang County, Seven Male and Female Bandits Arrested Successively

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Detective Section of the Police Bureau cracked a kidnapping case yesterday, arresting seven male and female bandits one after another. The two hostages were safely rescued in Hanlin Town, Danyang. Wang Youfu, a Dongtai native who runs a brothers' store at 902 Changning Road in this city, lives at 36 Kangfu Lane on the same road. On the afternoon of the 1st of this month, his son Rongxin (9 years old) and the son of his neighbor Lu Tong (now a salesman at Ronghua Xiang Hardware Store, 182 Daming Road) Weiguo (9 years old) disappeared while playing in the alley. Later, it was reported to the Jiangning Road Police Station and a missing person notice was published, but their whereabouts were unknown. On the 5th of this month, a letter was received from the post office, stating: Your sons are currently safe and sound. If you can prepare 50 million yuan to buy 20 gold bars as a ransom, they will be sent back; otherwise, they will be killed. The letter also stated that whether you agree or not should be indicated by your store's large discount flag. If the flag is still there the next day, it will be considered a refusal; otherwise, it must be taken down.

After receiving the letter, Wang and others knew that their sons had fallen into the hands of bandits, so they secretly reported to the Jiangning Road Police Station and the Detective Section of the General Bureau, requesting an investigation. They immediately followed the bandit's letter and took down the large discount flag. Waiting until the 9th, they received another letter, agreeing that his wife alone, wearing a red handkerchief, should take a rickshaw to the cow shed near the Hongqiao Road Airport to hand over the money between 12:00 noon and 3:00 PM that day. At this time, the Detective Section of the Police Bureau had also received a tip-off. Section Chief Deng Youli led Section Chief Ren Gongqin, clerks Chen Jinsheng, clerk Chen Xingrong, sergeants Xu Shutian, Ye Kui, etc. disguised themselves and waited in the wheat field near the cow shed until 2:30 PM. Wang's wife arrived by rickshaw. After the rickshaw left, a man resembling a farmer came and whispered to Wang's wife. At that time, Wang's wife claimed: Because I am short on funds, I can only raise five gold bars today. The bandit immediately ordered her to throw the gold bars into the cow shed and said that the remaining amount would be discussed at the entrance of Kangfu Lane at 6:00 PM in the afternoon. The police officers jumped out of the field upon witnessing everything and captured the bandit. At the same time, another accomplice was arrested in the balance field 200 yards from the cow shed. After strict interrogation, they confessed that their names were Wang Bingsheng, 25 years old, from Jiading, and Liu Chunlin, 25 years old, from Danyang. There were also two accomplices on the lookout, who were still in a nearby small teahouse. Wang Shougen (38 years old, from Jintai) and Liang Amao (33 years old, from Danyang) were immediately arrested and brought to the bureau together. After interrogation, the five criminals, Liu, confessed to the kidnapping and extortion. As for the two hostages, they were taken to Suzhou on the night of the kidnapping on the 1st and stayed there for two nights, then taken to Hanlin Town, Danyang. They are currently hidden in Liu Chunlin's house, guarded by his sister Liu Lianying. As for the motive for the kidnapping, it was due to gambling debts that could not be repaid. Therefore, Liu's wife, Yuan Gendi (a maid at 33 Kangfu Lane), and Yin Yongfu, who shared information at 39 Kangfu Lane, provided information. However, Wang Shougen and Liang Amao claimed that they came to Shanghai due to unemployment and asked Wang Liu to find them a job. Only today were they instructed to wait in the teahouse and report if they saw the police. After the police bureau obtained the confessions, in addition to continuing to arrest Yin Yongfu and Yuan Gendi at their addresses, they sent personnel by night train to Liu Chunlin's house in Hanlin Town, more than 20 miles from the city, on the 9th to retrieve the hostages and arrest the guard Liu Lianying. They all returned to Shanghai at 5:30 PM last night. In addition to notifying their families to claim the hostages, all the bandits are still under further investigation.

### At the Gate of the High Procuratorate, People Scramble to See Female Movie Stars, Chen Yan and Li Lihua Report in Full Dress, After Interrogation, They Were Released on Bail Pending Trial, Zhang Shankun and Other Ten People Still Did Not Appear in Court Yesterday, Zheng Ping and Hong Liezheng Were Busy Running Around for Their Husbands

[Our Newspaper's Report] The High Court Procuratorate interrogated the third batch of thirteen shadow play personnel suspected of being attached to the enemy yesterday, but only Chen Yanyan, Li Lihua, and Zhou Shimu reported. Prosecutor Qu Rong opened the court for interrogation and ordered them to be released on bail pending trial.

At 8:40 AM yesterday, Zhou Shimu was the first to report with a summons. Zhou is a photographer for "China Film" and currently works for Cathay Pictures Company, claiming that he felt quite sudden about being summoned this time. At 9:32 AM, Chen Yanyan arrived in a No. 1735 1941 Studebaker Champion car with two empty seats. She got out of the car in front of the Shanghai Prison and went to the High Procuratorate to report with a summons. Chen was wearing a black呢cloak, long red絨linen gloves, and black mid-筒leather shoes. After reporting, she sat in the bailiff's office. Before long, the horn sounded, and a No. 14535 1946 light gray Ford car drove into the Shanghai Prison Plaza. The first person to get out of the car was Li Lihua, accompanied by her husband Zhang Xupu and others. Li was wearing a玄fox fur coat, gray flannel trousers, and green 鷄skin shoes. After reporting, she sat opposite Chen Yanyan and talked quietly. The bailiffs' office suddenly became lively, and there were quite a few people who came to "admire the demeanor of the movie stars." At 9:45 AM, Prosecutor Qu Rong took the stand and Li Hua entered. At 10:26 AM, Zhou Shimu was also summoned to court for questioning. They each stated the process of participating in "China Film." They left the court at 10:38 AM, and Prosecutor Qu immediately ordered each to be released on bail pending trial. He ordered bailiff Wang Junhua to accompany Chen Yanyan, Cai Yunlong to accompany Li Lihua, and Shan Yiquan to accompany Zhou Shimu to check the bail separately. When Chen and Li were leaving, Zheng Ping, the wife of Mei Xi, hurriedly arrived to state the reason why Mei Xi could not attend court. Bian Hongliezheng, the wife of Bian Yuying, had already submitted a statement a day earlier claiming that Bian was abroad and was now on the way to Hong Kong, and claiming that Bian was currently suffering from heart disease and could not rush to the hearing. Others who were summoned but did not arrive included Zhang Shankun, Chen Yunshang, Zhang Shichuan, He Furan, Hu Junkang, Zhong Baoxuan, Jin Longzhang, Wu Shenchu, and others.

### Chen Yanyan Gave a Bitter Smile, Claiming That She Was Outdated in Filmmaking

According to Li Lihua yesterday, she went to Qingdao after the victory. The summons from the High Procuratorate was sent to her home in Baokang Lane, Xiafei Road. My mother sent a telegram to inform me, and I came to Shanghai on the 6th of this month to respond to the summons. Chen Yanyan said that she had returned to her old home in Beiping for a trip and recently came to Shanghai. She was a little confused about being summoned this time. Since Chen had not participated in the filming of the two puppet films "Regret of the Spring River" and "Eternal Remembrance," the group of reporters asked whether being summoned this time was related to Zhang Shankun? Chen replied: Maybe a little, but I was not asked about this today. When asked if she planned to make films again, she smiled bitterly and said: "I am outdated, now they are advancing!" Her words seemed to be full of sadness.

### Director Wu Talks About Year-End Bonuses, Not Necessarily the Same for Each Company, All Depends on Profit and Loss

[Our Newspaper's Report] Social Affairs Bureau Director Wu Kaixian said: At the meeting held at the Municipal Government on the 9th, it was decided that the year-end bonus should be limited to one month's salary increase, and it does not have to be the same for each company, all depending on the profit and loss situation. This decision will soon be submitted to the Municipal Government meeting for approval, and then announced by the Mayor for compliance. This resolution applies to all state-owned enterprises in this city. When asked how to determine the profit and loss situation of each factory, he replied: In principle, it is reported by the capitalists, but if the workers have different opinions, the Social Affairs Bureau will investigate and decide. Wu believes that the yarn factories are currently more prosperous, but when calculating their profits, the depreciation of machinery and equipment should be taken into account, and small yarn factories should also take into account the economic situation. Regarding the issue of labor discipline, Wu evaded answering, but agreed with the opinion of improving labor efficiency.

### President of the Executive Yuan Convenes Various Institutions and Organizations to Discuss the Development of Production Enterprises, Deeply Hoping for Assistance and Collaboration from Relevant Government Agencies and Industry and Commerce Leaders to Resolve Difficulties in the Shortest Possible Time

[Our Report] In order to assist the development of production enterprises and promote economic recovery, President Song convened a meeting at the Bank of China Building at 11:00 AM yesterday, inviting the chairmen and executive directors of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Banking Association, heads of national banks and bureaus, and responsible officials from the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs to discuss the matter. Those who attended included Bei Songsun, Wu Guozhen, Xu Boguo, Huo Yamin, Li Fusun, Xu Jiguan, Qin Runqing, Luo Qinghua, Lin Fengbao, Li Shuming, Xu Zixiang, Li Daonan, Huan Yanglun, Li Yunliang, Shou Jingwei, Xu Weiming, Liu Gongyun, and over twenty others. The meeting lasted for two hours.

Establish a Production Loan Review Committee to Actively Provide Loans Based on Needs

President Song delivered a speech, stating in brief: The government has always been extremely concerned about production enterprises. The consolidation of foreign exchange in August and the recent revision of the Provisional Regulations on Import and Export Trade are all aimed at reviving production enterprises and accelerating national construction. However, after eight years of long-term resistance against Japan, our country has suffered severe destruction and devastation by the enemy and puppet regimes, and it is not easy to restore the social and economic order to a normal state in a short time. In addition, the general psychology, after the victory, is overly optimistic, which easily leads to disappointment. Communist troops are again destroying production and transportation facilities everywhere, causing the national economy to fall into a state of chaos and instability. Therefore, although the government has given various assistance to the production sector in terms of administrative measures, all industries still feel that it is difficult to operate and difficult to sustain. The government has repeatedly discussed remedies for this, hoping to make overall arrangements and seek the revival of enterprises. What can be announced to you first are the following: First, for the lending of funds to normal production enterprises, the method has been approved and the national financial institutions and commercial firms, etc. are urged to actively provide loans according to the actual needs of each industry. A Provisional Review Committee for Production Enterprise Loans has been specially established by the Joint Treasury of the Four Banks to be responsible for handling it. The committee members have been invited to be responsible personnel from relevant agencies, chambers of commerce, and banking industries. In order to gather wisdom and deal fairly. Second, the interest rate on this production enterprise loan should be reduced to a reasonable limit, and the Central Bank will adjust it by means of transfer and collateral. Third, procedures and mortgage guarantee methods, etc., must be simplified as much as possible to meet the needs of various industries. Fourth, the machinery, raw materials, etc. needed for legitimate production enterprises should be given priority supply by the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, the Materials Exchange Supply Bureau, and other material management agencies as much as possible. Fifth, issues such as transportation, equipment, transportation costs, the handling of labor disputes, and the revision of tax systems and tax rates that are conducive to the professional development of assisting production are also being studied separately to improve methods. The overall goal is to resolve the difficulties felt by production enterprises in the shortest possible time and to actively seek development. This depends on the concerted efforts of all levels of competent authorities, relevant social organizations, and industrial and commercial leaders to help each other and achieve success on a daily basis, which is not something that the financial sector can accomplish alone.

Pooling Efforts to Achieve Practical Results

There is something that cannot be left unsaid. The prosperity of a country's economy and the progress of production enterprises depend not only on whether the national policy is sound, but also on whether the competent authorities at all levels and the competent business agencies can support the government's policies and implement them unremittingly. This is a key factor. Whether it can be fully utilized and achieve practical results is not only a matter of whether the competent authorities can work hard to promote it. All relevant social organizations, production enterprises themselves, and even every member of society must be able to cooperate with the government's policies, appreciate the difficult environment, pool their efforts, and prioritize the interests of the country and society over their own gains and losses. This is even more important.

Striving to Promote Three Expectations

I will strive to supervise and promote the maintenance and development of production enterprises in the future. However, I hope that you will pay special attention to the following three points:

(1) National banks and commercial firms should strive to be quick, convenient, and active in assisting the lending of funds to legitimate production enterprises, but they should automatically and effectively restrict loans that are not urgent or illegitimate.

(2) Production enterprises themselves should actively improve management, improve technology, increase efficiency, and reduce costs in order to seek self-reliance in survival and development, and should not rely solely on loans and material assistance.

(3) Economic and administrative authorities should effectively supervise the businesses under their jurisdiction, improve operations, and jointly seek promotion. Those who operate improperly or violate national policies should be strictly corrected immediately. The improvement of economic undertakings involves a wide range of issues. Post-war construction is undoubtedly difficult. The Democratic Party in the United States and Churchill in England were not spared the criticism of the people because of their great achievements. Even in Soviet Russia, prices have risen a lot since the armistice. China's economy has always been backward, and the impact of the war has been the longest, so the recovery work is also the most difficult. It is hoped that leaders from all walks of life will provide opinions at any time. If it is beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood, it will always be adopted and implemented at any time.

Various Sectors Express Opinions

Subsequently, Xu Ji, Li Fusun, Qin Runqing, Luo Qinghua, Jin Runxiang, and others spoke successively. The following is a summary of the opinions of each member: First, the most difficult problem currently faced by the industrial and commercial sectors is the high cost of wages. Because wages are issued according to the cost of living index, and the base salary has been increased several times, it excessively increases production costs and has a fatal impact on the industry. It is proposed that the government seek a reasonable solution to the handling of labor disputes and wages as soon as possible.

Second, the interest rate on black market loans is currently high, and commercial firms, in addition to paying the universal deposit reserve to the Central Bank, must also maintain a considerable deposit of exchange bank guarantee reserve. The Central Bank should allow for flexible use and domestic allocation, which can gradually suppress high interest rates.

Third, it is hoped that the scope of collateral for production enterprise loans will be expanded to allow the use of machinery as collateral without age restrictions.

Fourth, the import management method is well-intentioned and beautiful, and all sectors unanimously support it. However, please provide convenience for the prompt withdrawal of various imported goods that are in transit and have arrived at the port in order to save costs. As for how the government purchases and subsidizes various export goods or provides differential awards and preferential treatment, please also seek appropriate policies from the government as soon as possible.

President Song instructed separately on the above items, saying in brief: In addition to the approved methods, the opinions of Gu Ren will be submitted to the competent authorities for separate study and implementation.

### Illegal New Shacks in Restricted Areas to Be Demolished Starting Today Director of Public Works to Inspect Areas with Police and Artisans and Persuade Shack Dwellers to Relocate Voluntarily

[Our Report] Illegal new shacks in the restricted areas of this city will be demolished starting today. Zhao Zukang, Director of the Public Works Bureau, will personally lead Lu Xia and Song Xueqin, responsible persons of the Traffic Division of the Police Bureau, and six policemen and six artisans to inspect the restricted areas at 8:30 AM this morning. If the new shacks have not been demolished, they will be persuaded to relocate to non-restricted areas voluntarily, otherwise the artisans will dismantle them on their behalf. Director Zhao told reporters yesterday that the purpose of the measure is to protect the safety of everyone and also to prevent the shack dwellers from being in danger. Because the new shacks often do not comply with the regulations of the Public Works Bureau and are adjacent to each other. In the event of a fire, the consequences would be unimaginable. Therefore, it is necessary to ban them.

### Advocating Family Production New Activities in the Women's Circle to Organize Handicraft Production Cooperatives

[Our Report] The preparatory office of the Shanghai Women's Handicraft Production Cooperative hosted the news media and people's representatives from various districts of the city at the New Life Club on Weihaiwei Road at 3:00 PM yesterday. Wang Bihua, the initiator of the cooperative, reported on the motivation for its organization, saying that in recent years, prices have risen sharply, and the monthly salary income of general public educators and staff is only enough to cover the expenses of a few days, and family life is severely threatened. It is impossible to serve with peace of mind. In order to seek a solution, our women should take part of the responsibility and spontaneously organize women's handicraft production cooperatives to meet the needs of the current era. The cooperative's business is divided into two types: cooperative-run and self-run, which are promoted separately. The cooperative-run departments are divided into six types: sewing, embroidery, weaving, children's educational toys, art books, and by-product processing. The raw materials are purchased or the goods are manufactured by the cooperative for unified management, distributed to the members, and guided to make them at home. After the finished products are made, the cooperative pays reasonable wages according to the number of pieces, and at the end of the year, the members engaged in production can also withdraw product dividends. In the self-run part, all members who have production skills, regardless of the type of business, can operate individually in their family unit and entrust the cooperative to sell them at home and abroad and supply them to various consumer cooperatives in the city. The self-run production is responsible for its own profits and losses, but at the end of the year, if there is a surplus, 5% or more of the net profit should be withdrawn as the cooperative's public surplus.

The cooperative was initiated by Wang Jihua, Tian Shujun, Jin Zhenzhu, etc., and has been supported by municipal councilors Xu Ji, Xi Yushu, Zhan Wenhu, and Wang Xianqing. It is scheduled to publicly recruit shares starting on the 15th of this month, with each share costing 10 yuan in national currency. The minimum purchase for a member is 1,000 shares, totaling 10,000 yuan. It has been decided to formally establish it in April next spring. The preparatory office is located at 75 Wujiang Road.

### Labor-Management Disputes Abound, Social Affairs Bureau Mediating

[Our Report] Workers of the French tram company requested adjustment of job grades and the formulation of annual promotion regulations. Because workers' grades have been lowered and their treatment has been poor in the past few years, they demanded compensation. Because it involves public utilities and is of great importance, Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau and Director of the Labor Department are directly mediating.

Workers in the city's oil pressing industry demanded improvement in treatment, with two main requirements: (1) Salary increase. The minimum salary is 1.3 yuan, and the maximum salary is 2.2 yuan, calculated according to the worker's living or index. (2) The daily work is limited to eight hours. The employers said that the oil pressing industry is currently in a downturn and could not agree. The mediator of the Social Affairs Bureau proposed a compromise: (1) The maximum daily salary is set at 2 yuan. (2) Daily work is 10 hours. Mediation is still in progress, and no settlement agreement has been reached.

Labor-management disputes have occurred in the British American Tobacco Company, and the head of the Social Affairs Bureau and the Director of the Labor Department are directly mediating. In addition, the annual bonus issue of the China Tobacco Factory has not been resolved as of yesterday.

### Former Residents of Enemy and Puppet Real Estate Continue to Bid, Appeal to the City Council

The Central Trust Bureau, entrusted by the Enemy and Puppet Industry Processing Bureau of the Su, Zhejiang and Anhui Regions, held a second auction of enemy and puppet real estate. A portion of it was formally auctioned on the 26th of last month. According to Item 11 of the Bidding Instructions: "The enemy and puppet houses that have been auctioned must be cleared out within 20 days after signing the reservation." The original residents were in an uproar when they heard the news and are now running around in many ways, hoping that the Executive Yuan will withdraw the order. In addition, all residents of this city who use enemy and puppet houses have now sent a letter to the Municipal Council, appealing, the original letter said: "I read in the newspaper that the Central Trust Bureau announced the auction of 39 units of enemy and puppet houses, and claimed that once the houses are auctioned, the original residents must move out within one month, etc. It is found that some of the tenants in the 39 units of enemy and puppet houses were old tenants before the victory. Under the oppression of the enemy, they still maintained their lease rights. How can they be forced to move after the restoration of the country? Some of them are government officials who came to Shanghai from the rear. During the Anti-Japanese War, they have worked hard to chase the government. Now they have returned to Shanghai with the government. Under this severe housing shortage, how can poor government officials have gold bars to rent and top off the houses? It is not easy to obtain a unit of enemy and puppet houses from the Central Trust Bureau. Now the government wants to auction it off and force them to move. May I ask what remaining money government officials have to rent and top off gold bar houses? They will inevitably sleep on the streets. How can the government bear it? It seems inappropriate in terms of emotion and reason. Therefore, since the Central Trust Bureau announced the auction, all residents of the enemy and puppet houses in various alleys have unanimously opposed it, requesting to maintain the original lease rights, and the opinion community has also risen to discuss it, saying that the government's auction of enemy and puppet houses to enrich the national treasury is, in principle, extremely supportive, but after the auction, the original residents must move out. The authorities in charge seem to have not considered the reality too much. Because very few people went to register for the auction before, and the Central Trust Bureau also temporarily retained it because all sectors of society did not agree with the opinion. However, it is read in the newspaper today that the Central Trust Bureau is going to auction 12 units of enemy and puppet houses such as 181 Minhang Road again (bidding is scheduled to open on the 12th of this month). Is this decision to auction another test after the attitudes of all sectors have calmed down, or has the original proposal been revoked and the lease rights of the current residents maintained? Before we understand, we will not discuss it for the time being. However, we are deeply afraid that the Central Trust Bureau will ignore public opinion and stick to its own opinions. We dare to appeal to the officials of the Municipal Council and ask them to suggest to the government that it should deliberate on the facts before implementing a policy and correct the unreasonable measures of the Central Trust Bureau. Auction as you may, the lease rights of the original residents must be maintained. The minimum living standards of the people, such as food, clothing, shelter, and transportation, must not be deprived. Otherwise, the residents of all enemy and puppet houses in the city (about 10,000 people) will unite to petition the government and the people's opinion organs such as the Municipal Council in order to avoid the suffering of displacement. I hope that the wise officials will pay attention to this."

### Reader Consultation Medicine and Hygiene

(1) Child with Ringworm on Back

Zhu Hengzi asks

A two or three-month-old boy has ringworm on his back. At first, it was only the size of a silver coin, round. In the past month, it has gradually expanded. I am afraid that it will spread to other places, so I applied "Amolin", but this medicine is very painful after application and damages the skin. A two or three-month-old child cannot bear it. I don't know what method or medicine to use for treatment?

[Answer by Dr. Tang Renjin of Medicine] Whether it is ringworm is a question. It is best to consult a dermatologist for a detailed diagnosis, which is more appropriate. "Amolin" may be irritating and is not suitable for children.

(2) Persistent Cough

Zhu Xiuzhen asks My little daughter is one year and nine months old. She had a cough in the first half of the year. The doctor said it was whooping cough. After taking the medicine, it improved a little, but she still coughed and choked in the second half of the night. Last month, she had the flu and coughed frequently. She still played as usual during the day, and her diet was normal. Every morning at five o'clock, there was a wheezing sound in her trachea, and her breathing was not smooth, so she could not sleep anymore, which was very painful. After being diagnosed and treated by a doctor, the medicine did not work. Taking Paleto and cough syrup did not work either. I don't know what disease it is and how to treat it?

[Answer by Dr. Tang Renjin of Medicine] Go to the pediatric hospital for examination and X-ray fluoroscopy of the lungs, take cod liver oil and strontium tablets daily, supplement with fresh air and sunlight, and whooping cough vaccine injection must be decided after a doctor's examination.

### Visiting Traces

Looking for Cao Xiaochun A neighbor, Mrs. Yang, adopted an orphan nephew named Cao Xiaochun more than a decade ago. Zhou, an underground worker in Shanghai, introduced him to the army in western Zhejiang in the winter of the year before last. He has not communicated since he left. The old man is looking forward to it and washes his face with tears every day. I would like to ask your newspaper to publish it on his behalf. Those who know his whereabouts, please send a letter to Mrs. Yang, No. 1, Lane 857, Huazhong Road. Reader Zhou Jiahui

Looking for younger brother Qu Qi A native of Nanhai, Guangdong. Since the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, he has been in the army in Qujiang. It is rumored that he has been promoted to the rank of colonel due to his accumulated merits. However, due to the evil forces of the enemy and puppet regimes at that time, he was unable to communicate. Now, where has he been promoted and transferred to? There is no way to find out. Now, please ask your column to find him on his behalf. If I see the newspaper, I hope to contact 294 Nanjing West Road, Shanghai, on the second floor as soon as possible. Qu Baoguang, from Nanhai District, Guangdong, respectfully informs

Looking for friend Wu Wenzhi (Loyalty) 22 years old, male, from Yangxian County, Shaanxi. He joined the Third Regiment of the Youth Expeditionary Force in Chongqing in August 1944, went to India and then graduated from the first training class of the New First Army. Since then, there has been no news of him. It is heard that this unit has returned to China, but I don't know where it is stationed. If his colleagues or friends know his whereabouts, please send a letter to Wan Baoquan, Police Branch of Changshu Road, Shanghai.

Looking for younger brother Yang Shizong (from Pingyuan, Guangdong) He studied in the junior high school department of Jinan University in Shanghai in the autumn of 1935.

Since then, news has been cut off. Since the victory, I have been working in Beijing and Shanghai, and I have visited everywhere without success. I am deeply saddened by the separation of my flesh and blood. I have always admired your newspaper for serving the public and caring for the people. Please publish it so that the flesh and blood can be reunited. I am grateful. If Shizong's teachers, friends and classmates hear about his whereabouts, please also send a letter to "The General Headquarters of the Fifth Ordnance Depot in Xuzhou". Yang Shicheng bows

### Hope for Prompt Settlement of Foreign Exchange for Imported Cotton The Cost of Waiting One Day for a Barge is Not Small

[Our Report] The import and export industry in this city is actively investigating the amount of cotton used annually before the war, the amount of cotton used after the war, and the current actual needs. Detailed statistics will be made and submitted to the Provisional Import Management Committee as a reference when deciding the import volume of cotton. In addition, the Import and Export Association of this city held a group meeting today. Because raw cotton is currently the main import product, the Cotton Group held a meeting on the 9th to discuss the issue of applying for the history of cotton ordered abroad on November 17 and the issue of import permits for cotton that has already arrived. In particular, the solution to the latter problem is imminent, because the cost of waiting one day for each barge is about 1 million yuan, which is really beyond the ability of import and export merchants to bear. Relevant people hope that the government can deal with this matter leniently, because the announcement of the import permit system was completely sudden, and the business community was not prepared in advance, so the orders placed abroad could not adapt to the government's intentions. At the same time, President Song has expressed his willingness to release the foreign exchange quota for real cotton purchases. The government is currently still studying the quota limit for the import of various commodities, and the decision is pending. Once the decision is made, the distribution will be handled by the association itself in principle. It is reported that British and American import and export merchants have strengthened contacts with the Import and Export Association. According to insiders in the import and export industry, the amount of foreign cotton imported today is the largest for American cotton, followed by Indian cotton, and then Egyptian and Brazilian cotton. Indian cotton is already under the control of the Indian government, and a permit must be obtained before export.

### Gold Weak, US Dollar Firm, Hong Kong Notes and Exchange Rates Also Slightly Recovered

Yesterday, spot gold continued to weaken due to tight credit. The morning opening price was between 2,865,000 and 2,870,000, but it immediately showed instability. The Central Bank still intervened with force, and floating prices were quickly cut. Physical gold also became weak as it entered the market. After 10:00 AM, the Central Bank allocated 150 bars at a price of 2,840,000. Subsequently, the price briefly dropped below 2,835,000 before stabilizing. Soon after, the wind shifted slightly, and those with surplus funds, as well as remittances from other regions, pushed the price up to 2,865,000 near noon. At noon, the price fluctuated around 2,855,000. In the afternoon, the next-day delivery market was initially stable but then weakened, and the price ultimately hovered around 2,850,000. As a result, the closing price was 20,000 lower than the previous day. Gold ornaments were priced at 3,020,000, while sycee silver and silver dollars remained unchanged. Hidden interest rates remained between 1.2 and 1.5 jiao.

Foreign currencies turned weak again yesterday. The US dollar on the black market fell from 5050 yuan to below 5000 yuan. At noon, it fluctuated around the 5000 yuan mark. The afternoon was stable with little change, and there was demand at 5000 yuan. As a result, the closing price showed no significant change from the previous day. Hong Kong notes weakened slightly due to the gold market's telegraphic transfer rates, resulting in a slight recovery of ten yuan compared to the previous day's close. The Hong Kong exchange rate slightly recovered to around 990 yuan yesterday. Indian exchange rates were between 1180 yuan and 1200 yuan, and British exchange rates were between 15,800 yuan and 16,000 yuan. Only Hong Kong exchange rates saw some trading activity, while the rest remained quiet.

### Dispute Over Yarn Allocation to Yarn Merchants: Mayor Wu Decides to First Allocate to Retail Merchants; Overall Adjustment Measures Are Being Drafted

[Report from this Newspaper] The 1,500 bales of cotton yarn allocated by the Municipal Cotton Yarn Joint Distribution Association to retail merchant members of the Yarn Merchants Association could have been distributed last Saturday. However, the distribution was interrupted because the wholesale merchant members of the association insisted on equal treatment and requested the distribution association to temporarily reserve the 1,500 bales until a solution was found. It is learned that yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the chairman of the association, Tang Zhiliang, and executive directors Zhou Jiasheng and Shen Boqin, went to the Municipal Government to meet with Wu, the concurrently serving chairman of the Textile Control Committee, to seek a solution. Chairman Wu stated that the request from the wholesale merchants of the association could not be considered for the time being and personally wrote an instruction, stating: "The 1,500 bales of cotton yarn allocated to retail merchants by the Yarn Merchants Association should temporarily be distributed to retail merchants according to the decision of the Textile Control Committee. As for the overall adjustment measures, the textile associations of the six districts are currently consulting with the central government and the Textile Control Committee to draft them." The above instruction will be posted in the yarn market today and will be implemented immediately.

### Bond Market Dull; Series E Unified Bonds Draw 18 Winning Numbers

The bond market fluctuated yesterday. Series C Unified Bonds opened at 1110 yuan in the morning, and were sold by Fuyuan and others, falling to 1090 yuan. Rooms 5013 and 6004 bought in, and the price rose to 1210 yuan mid-day, eventually fluctuating between 1150 yuan and 1170 yuan.

### Tea Sales Exceptionally Quiet

It has been observed that various domestic teas such as Longjing, Shuangdang, Dafang, and Baozhong have traditionally been sold in large quantities to merchants from other regions. However, because the fancy teas that fellow merchants shipped to Tianjin and Yingkou after the Mid-Autumn Festival in the lunar calendar have not yet been sold out, trading is exceptionally quiet. As for the foreign tea market, high-end aged Keemun tea is being purchased by foreign firms such as Jardine Matheson. Unfortunately, market supply is depleted, and those holding the goods are asking exorbitant prices, leading to mostly unfavorable negotiations. As for green teas like Chunmee and Gunpowder, there is demand from places like Africa and Morocco. However, due to a lack of ships and demanding pricing, as well as the lack of clear regulations on the exchange rate between China and the French franc, it is reported that a large sum of French francs was telegraphed from that area to a certain bank in this city some time ago, but it has been difficult to exchange it, making it difficult to promote sales for the time being. Currently, tea merchants in this city are deeply hoping for assistance from the local authorities.

### Silk Generally Flat and Weak

Yesterday afternoon, the price of 120-count bright rayon fell again due to sellers entering the market. Tianqiao new goods were quoted at 3.6 million yuan in the morning, but fell by 100,000 yuan in the afternoon. Gaoshan was traded at 3.3 million yuan in the morning and 3.2 million yuan in the afternoon. The remaining Dull Rayon and 150-count bright rayon remained unchanged from the previous day due to a lack of allocation. The raw silk market was quiet with very little activity. Quotations did not change much, and the price of dried silk was slightly lower due to few buyers. Piece goods remained flat and weak, with very little trading. Although yesterday's damask prices remained at the previous day's levels, there was a lack of demand. Checkered satin saw a small decrease of 100 yuan, while the prices of other goods remained unchanged.

### Mulberry Seedling Loans Totaling 400 Million Yuan to be Handled by China Sericulture Corporation

The China Sericulture Corporation is actively promoting the silk industry improvement plan for the coming year. Currently, the first thing to be implemented is the mulberry seedling loan program. The corporation estimates that a total of 27 million mulberry seedlings will be planted next year: (1) 5 million Yang (Jiaxing Yangdong) grafted seedlings, with a loan of 5 yuan per seedling; (2) 20 million Guang (Guangde) grafted seedlings, with a loan of 8 yuan per seedling; (3) 2 million common grafted seedlings, with a loan of 10 yuan per seedling; (4) 100 million transplanted seedlings, with a loan of 3 yuan per seedling. The total amount will be limited to 400 million yuan in national currency. It is planned that an agreement will be reached with the lending bank this month to begin processing the loans.

### Woolens Market Calm

Yesterday, inspections of various tea house markets showed that the woolens market could be described as calm. Standard prices were mostly stable. Due to the pressure of high-interest loans, the entire commercial sector, both local and out-of-town, was unstable. Although there was still a whole month left for winter sales and news of profitable deals was heard from time to time, the overall woolens market remained difficult to improve. The practice of hoarding has not only disappeared, but most merchants have reversed their attitude from previous years and are looking to sell off their inventory to raise funds.

### Silk Weaving Industry Calls for Relief After the Closure of Xin Da Silk Factory; China and Communications Banks Continue to Process Loans

Since the Four Joint Offices approved the silk weaving industry loan, which was to be handled by China and Communications Banks, the industry has repeatedly requested flexibility regarding the loan terms, which were initially set at 70% for raw materials and 30% for finished products. Subsequently, President Bei of the Central Bank, sympathetic to the difficulties faced by the industry, approved a change to 50% for raw materials and 50% for finished products, which the industry agreed to. On November 25, China and Communications Banks began processing applications. On December 5, after Xin Da Silk Factory received a loan of 1 billion yuan, it immediately announced its liquidation. Therefore, on December 7, the industry association sent Cai Yitao and Liu Qingyi to meet with Lin Fengbao, director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, and deputy director Gong Zishuang, while also inviting Sun Zuirui, deputy manager of China Bank, and Zhu Tongjiu, chief auditor of Communications Bank, to report on the current plight of the industry. Director Lin then stated that a meeting would be held again on December 9. At 3:00 PM on December 9, the meeting was held at the Central Bank, attended by Lin Fengbao and Wang Zishuang from the Central Bank, Wang Zhitong and Zhou Dagang from the Central Trust Bureau, Sun Fengrui and Ma Zhunliang from China Bank, Zhu Tongjiu and Yu Jieqiong from Communications Bank, Ge Jingzhong and Wang Yinyao from the China Sericulture Corporation, and silk weaving industry representatives Liu Qingyi and Cai Yitao. First, Liu Qingyi reported on the current situation of the industry. Then, Mo Jingzhong from the China Sericulture Corporation expressed his opinion, stating that the silk weaving industry is one of the largest industries in China and is of great importance to the national economy and people's livelihood, and that efforts should be made to solve its current difficulties so that it can overcome the challenges. Subsequently, ways to resolve the situation were discussed, and the results were very satisfactory. China and Communications Banks continue to process loans today. It is reported that the silk weaving industry will hold a general membership meeting this afternoon (December 10) to discuss solutions and provide them to the authorities for adoption.

Mung beans saw very little demand from Southeast Asia, but domestic demand was very active, with prices rising by 1,000 yuan. Red beans saw both arrivals and sales slow, showing no significant change. Sesame saw active sales to merchants from Guangdong, with prices rising by another 1,000-2,000 yuan. Raw peanuts were also being purchased by Guangdong merchants and were active in the local market, with prices rising by another 1,000-2,000 yuan. Corn from Qingdao saw very strong demand, with demand exceeding supply, making it a scarce commodity, and prices rose sharply by 2,000-3,000 yuan. Broad beans remained stable. The oil market saw active retailer purchases, with both raw soybean oil and refined soybean oil rising uniformly by 3,000-5,000 yuan. Rapeseed oil also rose by 2,000-3,000 yuan.

### Leather Goods Industry Sluggish; Two Companies Have Declared Bankruptcy

There are over one hundred leather goods firms in the city that engage in export, with about ten of them being larger in scale. Only one or two firms trade directly with foreign countries. Recently, due to the sluggish leather goods market, it has been reported that two firms have declared bankruptcy, with the debt of one firm being 160-170 million yuan and the other being 70-80 million yuan. The reasons for the bankruptcies are that their capital was insufficient, their businesses were too broad, and the interest on their external debts increased daily. In the current lifeless leather goods industry, they were unable to sustain themselves.

### Fertilizer Prices Soar

The price of fertilizer has risen by 150,000 yuan per ton, from 1,500,000 yuan to 1,650,000 yuan, in the past week. Demand from out-of-town merchants and the local market is strong. Zinc powder was previously imported in large quantities, and the goods were quite sluggish. However, since there have been no recent imports, the market inventory has also decreased, so the price has increased from 1,500,000 yuan to 1,800,000 yuan per ton. Glycerin sales have become more active, and the market price is 180,000 yuan per dan. Merchants are unwilling to sell easily. In February of this year, the market price of glycerin was once as high as 400,000 yuan per dan. Later, due to the large number of imports from the US, the price gradually fell. Currently, US goods are scarce on the market, and only Chinese-French triangular glycerin is available. Sulfuric acid is no longer being purchased, and the price is still falling.

### Shandong Education Repatriation Faces Two Major Difficulties

Li Taihua Scheduled to Fly to Beijing to Report

[Report from this Newspaper in Jinan] Before the Shandong Provincial Government repatriated to Jinan after the victory, various colleges and universities remained in Fuyang, and the issue of repatriation had not been fully resolved. Regarding this issue of education repatriation, Education Director Li Taihua stated, "There are currently two major difficulties with the repatriation of colleges and universities remaining in Fuyang. First, the repatriation funds have still not been secured. The three yuan issued by the Ministry of Education has already been completely spent. Second, there are difficulties in relocation after repatriation. It is impossible for the colleges and universities remaining in Fuyang to return to their original campuses in Jinan, and finding new school buildings is beyond our capabilities. I am scheduled to fly to Beijing next week to report to the central government on this issue and the general issue of education repatriation throughout the province, in the hope of a quick solution."

### Middle School Speech Contest to be Held for One Week

The Municipal Middle School Students' Mandarin Speech Contest was originally scheduled to hold preliminary rounds on the 15th of this month and final rounds on the 22nd. More than sixty schools have registered, but many have requested that the dates be postponed, citing the short timeframe and lack of preparation. The Bureau of Education believes that since the original intention of this speech contest was to have widespread participation from public and private secondary schools, it should take their difficulties into account and avoid excluding them from participating. The bureau has approved a one-week postponement, with the preliminary rounds rescheduled for the 22nd of this month and the final rounds rescheduled for the 29th. The registration deadline has been extended to the 20th.

### French Journalist's Novel, "Dust of the Times," Wins Literary Prize

### Importers with Registered American Goods to be Allowed to Import; Those Without Registration Will Be Treated as Abandoned

The Import Management Committee originally stipulated that importers who ordered goods from the US before the 17th of last month that had not yet been shipped, or that were shipped before the 24th of last month, had two weeks to complete registration procedures. Subsequently, at the request of import businesses, the deadline was extended to yesterday (the 9th). It is reported that the committee has decided not to extend the deadline further. Any importers who fail to register by the deadline will be considered to have waived their rights and will not be allowed to import their goods. It is reported that the claim that some goods will not be allowed to be imported is not true, according to the person in charge of the committee. Furthermore, it has been learned that importers can apply to import goods at any time that arrive after the 17th. Production equipment listed in Appendix 1 and various goods listed in Appendix 3 do not require allocation measures. Only imported goods listed in Appendix 2 will be subject to allocation. However, before the allocation measures are determined, those who are interested can apply at any time. If manufacturers do not entrust import businesses, they can apply directly. As of yesterday, a total of over 3,000 import businesses have registered, and the Committee is currently reviewing them. Many of the application forms filled out by import businesses do not comply with the regulations, especially in the sections for the name of the imported goods and the applicant's quantity. The Committee has returned these forms to the original applicants for completion.

### 28 Leather Factories Close Amidst Industrial and Commercial Crisis

There are a total of 350 small and medium-sized leather manufacturing factories in the city. Due to the pressure of high-interest loans, 28 factories have closed so far. With the end of the year approaching, it is expected that many factories will have difficulty surviving the year-end closure. In addition to high-interest loans, the reasons for the closures include: (1) The dumping of glazed leather goods, (2) Increased wages, (3) Difficulties in transportation to other cities. Currently, most leather goods factories are in a semi-suspended state, with only a dozen workers manufacturing large leather trunks to keep the business alive. It is reported that over a thousand leather workers have lost their jobs under these heavy pressures.

### Fertilizer Prices Rise

The price of fertilizer has increased from 1.5 million yuan to 1.65 million yuan per ton in the past week. Demand from merchants and local buyers is strong. A large quantity of zinc sulfide powder was previously imported, and the goods were quite sluggish. Since there have been no recent imports, the market inventory has also decreased, so the price has increased from 1.5 million yuan to 1.8 million yuan per ton. Glycerin sales have become more active, and the market price is 180,000 yuan per dan. Merchants are unwilling to sell easily. In February of this year, the market price of glycerin reached 400,000 yuan per dan. Later, due to the large number of imports from the US, the price gradually fell. Currently, US goods are scarce on the market, and only Chinese-French triangular glycerin is available. Sulfuric acid is no longer being purchased, and the price is still falling.

### Tianjin Soybeans and Soybean Oil Arrive in Shanghai

[Report from this Newspaper] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company ship transported goods from Tianjin to Shanghai, including over 1,880 bags of soybeans and 305 barrels of soybean oil. Furthermore, the Haixuan ship sailed to Keelung the day before yesterday, carrying 18,300 large soybean cakes, 55,400 small soybean cakes, over 540 bags of soybeans, and 275 pieces of hemp heads.

### Sugar Market Slightly Higher

Yesterday, the sugar market trend was flat. The price of grade A sugar set by the association was 134,000 yuan, up 500 yuan. Raw sand grade A was 118,000-119,000 yuan. Shantou's grade A sugar was 95,000-96,000 yuan, and re-roasted red sugar was 100,500-103,000 yuan, with 200-300 bags traded. Guangdong's Runde grade A sugar was 98,000 yuan, and Qingyuan's covered slice grade A sugar was 83,000 yuan, with dozens of pieces traded. Xinghua's grade A white powder sugar opened at 131,000-130,000 yuan, and red sugar opened at 120,000 yuan to 115,000-116,000-118,000 yuan, with one hundred or more bags traded.

### Casing Trade Depressed; Fresh Casing Purchase Prices Still Low in This City; Finished Product Exports Still Require Discounts

The market price for fresh pig casings in this city is still around 1,300-1,400 yuan per set. It is reported that market prices in inland cities such as Songjiang are even higher than in this city. According to people in the trade, the price of fresh casings before the war was equivalent to the price of fresh meat. For example, if fresh meat was 2 jiao per jin, fresh casings should also be priced at that amount. However, at that time, the price of casings abroad was also high. Although the current price of fresh casings is considered low, the finished product still requires discounts because the price in New York is still uncertain. Although the market in Europe is better, the French franc exchange rate makes it impossible to settle accounts, so it is still unprofitable.

### Agricultural Bank Decides to Support Taiwan Tea Exports

Tea exports are still extremely difficult due to high costs and large price differences. However, Taiwan tea is very inexpensive. President Chou Jingwei and other directors of the Tea Industry Association plan to engage in export operations and have requested loan funds from the China Land Bank. The Agricultural Bank has decided to provide financial assistance. It is reported that Shou and others will travel to Taiwan within the week to plan. It is understood that the Union Tea Company is targeting Europe and the United States and has an annual production of 3,000 tons. Prices are stable in Taiwan, life is stable, and the cost of tea is extremely low, more than half that of tea in the mainland. Therefore, the prospects for export are very promising.

### Cotton Industry Association Deems Restrictions on Indian Cotton Exports Inappropriate

[Reuters, Bombay, 9th] The East India Cotton Association has written to the Indian government, urging the central government to consider and announce its cotton policy as soon as possible. The letter pointed out that the Indian government's cotton control policy has violated government regulations and created a black market. Regarding the cotton export policy, the association agreed with the large quantity of exports allowed this season, but opposed the principle of levying a cotton export tax. The association stated that cotton has always been a surplus commodity in India, and India has always exclusively produced short-staple cotton. Therefore, exports of this type of cotton must be maintained to ensure that the economic interests of the country and cotton farmers are not affected. The association fears that restricting the export of cotton with a staple length of 11/16 inch and above would be dangerous, as Indian mills have never consumed all of the cotton produced with a staple length of 13/16 inch. Some quantity of this type of cotton can be allowed for export without hindering Indian mills. Otherwise, if this type of cotton remains in the market, the general price of cotton will inevitably be suppressed.

### Nanjing Middle School Students Begin Physical Fitness Tests; Ministry of Education Issues Testing Methods

[Our Nanjing Report] The Ministry of Education is conducting nationwide physical fitness tests for middle school students, starting with Nanjing City. According to this newspaper, the tests will begin on the 11th of this month, school by school, starting with Mingde Girls' Middle School in Nanjing, followed by Ginling Girls' Middle School, and then other schools. The testing in each of these two schools will take one week. It will take three months to complete the tests for all nine municipal middle schools and twenty-three private middle schools in Nanjing. The methods for each physical fitness test have recently been finalized, printed, and distributed, as detailed below:

Methods for Height Measurement

(A) Height: When measuring height, the person being measured should remove their shoes (preferably wearing only shorts), stand in front of the height scale, arms naturally hanging down, chest out, abdomen in, knees straight, heels together, and toes apart. The heels and back should be in contact with the vertical post of the height scale. The head should be held straight, with the eyes looking straight ahead. The measurer should stand to the side of the person being measured, using one hand to support the back of their head and the index finger of the other hand to touch the lower edge of the eye socket to see if it is level with the upper edge of the ear canal. The measurer should also gently press the abdomen with one hand to make it contract. At this point, the measurer can observe the posture of the person being measured from the front and side to ensure it meets the standard. Then, with a swift movement, place the horizontal ruler on the vertex of the person being measured and accurately read the value. The unit of record is centimeters, rounded to the nearest centimeter.

Methods for Weight Measurement

(B) Weight: When measuring weight, the person being measured should wear at most shorts or an outer garment with a known weight, which should be subtracted after the measurement. The person being measured should stand upright (or sit upright) in the center of the scale, and movements when getting on and off the scale should be gentle and slow.

Methods for Chest Measurement

(C) Chest Circumference: When measuring chest circumference, the person being measured should stand straight, with the right foot half a step forward, head straight, and arms naturally hanging down. The measurer should stand to the right side of the person being measured. Before measuring, the measurer should gently tap the arms or engage in simple conversation to reduce mental tension. Use a measuring tape from behind, under the armpits, around to the front, so that the measuring tape is below the shoulder blades in the back and on the upper part of the nipples in the front (for women with large breasts, it should be placed on a slightly higher chest surface), so that the measuring tape crosses at the right nipple. The value should be recorded at the end of exhalation but before inhalation. The unit of record is centimeters, rounded to the nearest centimeter.

Methods for Total Body Strength Measurement

(D) Total Body Strength: During the test, the person being tested should stand on the footplate of the total body strength meter, feet ten centimeters apart, toes at a forty-five-degree angle, body slightly leaning forward (thirty degrees), hands gripping the bar. The hook at the bottom of the total body strength meter is fixed to the footplate chain. The knee and elbow joints should not be bent. Pull upward slowly with all strength. The unit of record is kilograms. Each person is limited to three attempts, with the highest record used as the official score.

Methods for Lung Capacity Measurement

(E) Lung Capacity: Before the test, have the person being tested loosen their upper garment, hold the air inlet with their left hand, first take a deep breath until they cannot inhale any more, then quickly place the air inlet on their mouth and slowly blow into it. The unit of record is cubic centimeters. Each person is limited to three attempts (if the records increase with each attempt, it can be continued), with the largest record used as the official score.

Methods for Running Test (Boys and Girls)

(F) 50 Meters (Girls, Junior High Boys), 100 Meters (Senior High Boys): (1) When testing the 50-meter or 100-meter run, two people should be in a group and start simultaneously, using a crouching start. Before starting, the person being tested should stand behind the starting line. When the starter calls the first command, "On your marks," they should squat on the ground, preparing for the starting position. After the second command, "Set," is called, the buttocks should be raised slightly. After the starter blows the whistle, the person should sprint out with force. The starter should wave a red flag when blowing the whistle. (2) The person being tested should run straight ahead. (3) The timer should start the stopwatch when they see the starter wave the red flag and stop the stopwatch as soon as the body of the person being tested reaches the vertical plane of the finish line, and record the time.

Methods for Standing Long Jump Test

(G) Standing Long Jump: (1) There is no limit to the running distance for the person being tested. (2) The person being tested should jump from the takeoff board. (3) The jump distance should be measured at a right angle from the nearest point where any part of the person's body lands to the outer edge of the takeoff board or its extended line. (4) If the person being tested runs past the takeoff board or its extended line, or if any part of their foot touches the ground in front of the takeoff board, it should be counted as one trial jump, and the score will not be measured. (5) Each person is limited to three jumps, with the longest record used as the official score.

Methods for Softball Throwing Test

(H) Softball Throwing: (1) Use a twelve-ounce softball. (2) Throw with one hand from behind the throwing line (must be over the shoulder). If the throwing line is crossed or thrown in any other way, it will be counted as one failure. (3) Each person is limited to three throws, with the longest record used as the official score.

Methods for Pull-Up Test

(I) Pull-Ups: (1) Pull-ups are performed on a single bar. (2) Grip the bar with a forward grip and hang. (3) The pull-up is considered complete when the chin passes over the horizontal bar. When the body is hanging down, the arm and elbow joints should be vertical. If the pull-up is attempted again before the arm is fully extended, it will not be counted as one pull-up. (Note) Before the test, the testing methods should be explained in detail to the person being tested and demonstrated.

### Election of Senators at All Levels Limited to Registered Candidates; Ministry of Interior Sends Letter to Municipal Government for Verification

### New Agricultural Facilities in Jiangxi

— Quwo Fast News on the 10th, Special Correspondent Yu Ningpo

Jiangxi is an important agricultural province in southern China. The production of various crops is relatively abundant compared with other provinces. In the past and present, the authorities have made considerable efforts to improve, relieve, and revive agriculture in this province. The reporter may as well give a summary report on the general facilities of agriculture in this province in the past and present:

Evolution of Agriculture in the Past

In the winter of the 21st year of the Republic of China (1932), in order to revive the rural areas and eradicate banditry, the Jiangxi Provincial Government sent personnel to organize inspection teams to visit agricultural areas such as Ding County, Zouping, and Wuxi to inspect rural undertakings and establish rural improvement societies. Wanjiabu, Anyi County, was selected as the experimental area, and politics, economy, and culture were determined as the goals of improving farmers' lives. At the same time, with the support of the National Committee, three experts from the League of Nations were invited to Jiangxi to conduct on-site inspections. More than one million yuan was allocated from the US cotton and wheat storage funds to subsidize the establishment of cooperative, agricultural, and health agencies. In the autumn of the 23rd year (1934), Shangdundu in Linchuan, Yaocun in Nancheng, Gangshang in Fengcheng, Sanhu in Xingan, Zaotang in Gaoan, and Tujiapu in Yongxiu were selected to establish six rural service areas. In the spring of the 24th year (1935), Qingyunpu in Nanchang, Dunhou Village in Ji'an, Shaxi in Shangrao, and Shishang and other places in Ningdu were selected to establish four service areas. The province's agricultural, educational, health, and cooperative undertakings were used to jointly devote themselves to rural revival and construction. Regarding

Adjustment Work

The "Jiangxi Rural Improvement Undertakings Committee" was established as the agency for adjusting the work. The functions and powers exercised by the committee include: (1) To oversee the implementation of rural experimental undertakings in the province. (2) To review the budgets of the rural experimental areas. (3) To train rural workers. (4) To guide the working methods of the rural experimental areas. (5) To coordinate the implementation steps of the rural experimental areas. (6) To assess the working steps of the rural experimental areas. (7) To preside over economic and social surveys and statistics in the rural experimental areas. (8) To compile and publish work reports from the rural experimental areas. (9) To review the working areas of newly established rural experimental areas in the province. (10) To supervise and urge local governments to promote rural improvement undertakings. And to formulate a

Three-Year Plan

The content of the plan is divided into four items: management, education, cultivation, and health. Regarding the cultivation item: (1) At least 50% of farm households in the entire area can adopt improved seeds. (2) Wastelands and barren lands in the entire area can be fully utilized. (3) Cooperatives are organized in the entire area. (4) 40% of farm households in the entire area should have at least one sideline business in addition to raising pigs and ducks. (5) At least one or two of the following should be available in each Bao in the entire area: Bao forests, Bao ponds, Bao fields, and Bao warehouses. (6) Water conservancy projects such as dike construction and pond excavation should be carried out as needed in the entire area. (7) Farmers in the entire area should make full use of private ponds to raise fish and plant lotus roots to increase production. (8) Farm households in the entire area should effectively reduce the extravagance of weddings and funerals.

### Current Various Facilities

This year, Jiangxi Province's agricultural facilities, in addition to the central government's allocation of funds to assist agricultural recovery, are all jointly handled by the Provincial Government's Reclamation Office, the Agricultural College, and the Relief Branch, three relevant agencies. Regarding agricultural loan promotion and subsidy, they are actively pursuing them with all their might. In recent years, the three agencies have worked quite hard on matters of agricultural revitalization.

Assisting Recovery

The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has allocated a special recovery fund of 83.375 million yuan for assisting the province's agricultural recovery this year. More than ten million yuan have already been allocated to the province. Agencies in this province that implement the distribution of relief materials for post-disaster relief, promote agriculture, the joint federation for propagating and distributing vegetable seeds for agricultural affairs, and guide the use of disease and pest control medicines and machinery and fertilizers for agricultural affairs can all receive special subsidies. In addition to the above-mentioned recovery funds, insect pest control powder, vegetable seeds, chemical fertilizers, and small agricultural tools are being transported from Shanghai to Jiangxi. Furthermore, given that Jiangxi Province's rice harvest loss this year amounted to over 200 billion yuan, in order to increase grain production next year, a movement to protect rice seedlings is being launched in Jiangxi, with the selection of several key points to spray DDT as a demonstration work for seedling cultivation. The Taiwan Cooperation Management Office of this province, in order to support agricultural development, has specially requested an 8 billion yuan loan from the Four Banks Joint Office through the Department of Construction, which has been handed over to the Agricultural Loan Committee for separate approval of its use. The approved amount for agricultural loans in Jiangxi Province this year has reached over 968.76 million yuan, including loans for production, transportation and sales, agricultural warehouses, promotion, sideline industries, water conservancy, and recovery areas. The Agricultural Bank's remaining loan of over 1.49 billion yuan will also focus on assisting farmers' associations in handling agricultural loan business in the fourth quarter of this year.

Promoting Winter Plowing

In order to encourage farmers in various counties to diligently create a winter plowing atmosphere and seek an increase in agricultural production, the Agricultural College has decided to launch a winter plowing campaign starting this month. The college will be in charge of agricultural publicity throughout the province, while county governments will directly organize activities within their respective counties. Five key points for promoting winter plowing have also been established: (1) This year's winter plowing promotion should be implemented universally. All land within the territory must be planted with winter crops or plowed and irrigated, with no idle land. (2) The personnel responsible for the winter plowing promotion agencies in each county this year and the steps to be taken should be handled in accordance with the previously promulgated regulations of the 34th year of the Republic, and should be earnestly implemented. (3) All barren mountains reclaimed this year must be planted with winter crops. (4) Winter control of rice stem borers must be carried out in accordance with the winter rice stem borer control implementation measures. (5) Winter plowing supervision should be carried out in accordance with the regulations of the 34th year of the Republic.

Improving Agricultural Tools

The Provincial Government believes that agricultural production after the war urgently needs to be strengthened. It is now using 20 sets of new-style agricultural tools allocated to Jiangxi by the Executive Headquarters to set up factories in Qi Yan for manufacturing, so that agricultural tools can be mechanized.

Demonstration Farms

(1) To harmonize the relationship between landlords and tenants, improve the lives of tenant farmers, and implement the 25% rent reduction; (2) To realize "land to the tillers" in four counties, namely Ganxian, Shangyou, Xinsheng, and Nankang, seven demonstration areas for supporting self-cultivating farmers will be established. In one township in each county, land will be requisitioned by district segments and allocated to self-cultivating farmers for contracting. (3) In Zhanggongdu, Gao'an, and other places with the most barren land, demonstration farms for revitalization will be established. The Hangzhou cooperative reclamation area and the righteous people's re-cultivation area will be jointly managed by relevant business agencies of the provincial government and economic agencies for military rehabilitation to support rural revitalization.

Supporting Cultivating Farmers

One to three townships have been selected in 13 counties, including Nanchang, Fengcheng, Linchuan, Nancheng, Nanfeng, Guangze, Fuliang, Poyang, Jiujiang, Ganxian, Nankang, Shangyou, and Xin, to establish experimental townships for supporting self-cultivating farmers, implementing a kind of loan for supporting self-cultivating farmers, and allocating public barren land, or requisitioning and allocating private agricultural land and tenant agricultural land. The total area of each demonstration area is 13,290 mu, with a total of 1,681 farm households and a total of 7.962 million yuan in loans.

Increasing Grain Production

For the work of increasing grain production, the Agricultural College is mobilizing farmers to make use of idle or barren land to widely plant miscellaneous grains, while promoting dryland rice. It is also designating nine counties in the Xin River basin, namely Shangrao, Yushan, Qianshan, Hengfeng, Guangfeng, Guixi, Yiyang, Yujiang, and Yugan, to promote planting, allocating 1,000 mu per county and setting a deadline for completion of planting.

Cooperative Farms

The Jiangxi branch of the Relief and Salvation Administration and the Provincial Reclamation Office are assisting in establishing the Zhanggongdu Cooperative Farm. The farm is located in the triangular area on the north bank of Zhanggongdu, with an initial area of 5,000 mu, which will be expanded to 10,000 mu. Initially, 100 reclamation households will be recruited, gradually expanding to 200 households. The farm will provide free plowing cattle, agricultural tools, seedlings, and construction water conservancy materials. The total cost is estimated to be about 200 million yuan, which will be subsidized by the branch office. 100 tents, two bundles of old clothes, and 2,550 small bags of flour will also be allocated to solve the initial problems of clothing, food, and housing. In principle, machinery will be used for power application, and mechanized plowing and irrigation will be tested. Mechanization will also be used as much as possible for dryland farming and sowing. Agriculture will be the main business, with animal husbandry and agricultural product manufacturing as secondary.

Agricultural College Work

From July 1st to September 15th of this year, the Agricultural College has carried out 16 agricultural-related tasks: (1) Conducting rice variety investigations and analysis experiments; (2) Promoting rice seed varieties and guiding seed retention and variety exchange; (3) Adding meteorological observation to facilitate agricultural research; (4) Conducting cooperative crop experiment research with comprehensiveness; (5) Promoting American bridge propagation and management work; (6) Preparing to restore the work of the Southeast Hemp Improvement Institute of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry that has been taken over; (7) Actively carrying out epidemic prevention and control, and enriching equipment and facilities; (8) Preventing and controlling insect pests and trying to manufacture insecticides; (9) Sampling and nurturing tung forests and pre-collecting forest tree seeds; (10) Researching and manufacturing new-style agricultural tools; (11) Propagating and promoting excellent fruits and vegetables; (12) Guiding the establishment of tea gardens and improving tea-making technology; (13) Distributing agricultural relief supplies; (14) Establishing agricultural post-war promotion and guidance agencies; (15) Adjusting the organization of agricultural extension offices in administrative districts; (16) Guiding farmers' associations to carry out self-help undertakings.

Seeking a Way Out

The various agricultural facilities written above are all aimed at the needs of agriculture in this province, that is, the urgent need for the authorities to catch up and find a way out. Because the foundation of Jiangxi's economy is entirely built on agriculture, but the phenomenon of rural collapse has spread from the bottom to the surface, from the countryside to the cities. Especially in the future, the goal of revitalizing the industry is to work from the surface to the bottom, so that the foundation of Jiangxi's social economy will be more consolidated. Other construction problems can be easily solved, and this belief is also the most sincere expectation of the 30 million people of Jiangxi.

### Vignettes of Jiangxi Province

— Air dispatch on the 3rd.  Reported by Liu Zao, our reporter in Nanchang

Dividing Kuling – Xingzi and Jiujiang Compete with Each Other

The division of Kuling has already become a major topic of discussion in the Xingzi County Assembly. Although some people in Jiujiang are considering voluntarily moving Kuling away, due to the dispute over county boundaries, it is unlikely that they will willingly "move it away." Looking at the reasons put forward by Xingzi, it is clear that Kuling does not belong to Jiujiang. Therefore, the current dispute is about whether Kuling belongs to Jiujiang.

Xingzi County believes that the "Detailed Map of Xingzi Borders" attached to the Xingzi County Gazetteer compiled in the tenth year of Tongzhi shows that Kuling is within the jurisdiction of Xingzi. However, the Jiujiang County Gazetteer does not mention that Kuling belongs to Jiujiang. The watershed between the two counties of Jiujiang and Xingzi runs from Wuzhang Mountain, through Xiaotianchi, Dagushan, Tubaling, Zhichuan Peak, Shangshen Peak, to Matouling Peak. Kuling is south of this watershed, so it should be under the jurisdiction of Xingzi. Xingzi County also put forward the recent reason for handling the household registration of Kuling, saying: In the 25th year of the Republic, the Xingzi County Government sent personnel to Kuling to handle household affairs. A Juren from Dehua secretly sold Kuling to foreigners, but Xingzi gentry strongly opposed it, and it was changed to leasing. They are now determined to argue their case based on these reasons.

### Commissioner's Office – Equivalent to a Document Forwarding Agency

Regarding the argument that the Administrative Commissioner's Office should be a business agency, all parties believe that there is a need for improvement. The Five-Year Construction Plan of Jiangxi Province may also suggest that the central government abolish the Commissioner's Office and change it to a supervisory agency. The agency will be named the Supervisory Office, with two directors or chiefs. All the inspectors of the provincial government's various units will be concentrated in each region for supervision, without handling general administrative affairs. The current Commissioner's Office, although named as supervision, is actually only equivalent to a document forwarding agency.

### The Tomorrow of the Longhai Railway

— Air dispatch on the 3rd.  Reported by Li Chi, our reporter in Xi'an

On the map of China's railway system, if the Pinghan Road and the Yuehan Road are connected like the "dressing to the right" posture in the "Infantry Drill Manual," then the Longhai Railway is like the "arms outstretched in a 'T'" position. This major trunk line, running continuously eastward, forms a large cross with the two straight lines.

In recent years, the transportation status of the Longhai Railway has been unsatisfactory to all parties. This is an undisguised fact. The reporter is not very clear about its "reputation" in Henan, but in Shaanxi, the criticism of the Longhai Railway has become a routine item at every Provincial Assembly and Municipal Provisional Assembly meeting, especially the fact that the transportation volume is insufficient for people's needs has long been the central issue.

Of course, the railway authorities also have difficulties. Summarizing the reasons for their past defenses, they are nothing more than the lack and obsolescence of transportation equipment, the heavy traffic of troops and military supplies, and the insecurity of some sections of the railway line... But we also want to ask: The rampant black market ticket sales at stations, the blatant extortion by ticket inspectors on trains, the lack of order on stations and trains, even the open-top freight cars, crammed with people groping in the dark, without even a light on each car... Are these things theoretically or actually related to the "United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration" not providing new locomotives?

The reporter once heard someone who had been recording price data here for several years say that almost every price increase in Xi'an in recent years was attributed to reports that the Longhai Railway lacked military wagons. The reporter has also felt the same way during his two years in Shaanxi. Not to mention distant events, but recently, food prices have soared by more than double, coal has also risen, and so has oil. There is no incident that is not blamed on the railway bureau's lack of transportation capacity. However, is the transportation capacity really so unavailable? We are quite hesitant to give a definite yes or no answer. I remember that two months ago, fuel was expensive in Xi'an, so the kerosene transported from Gansu to this place via Lingbao was also expensive. People wanted to buy from the state-run domestic kerosene operating agency, but they said they had no stock, because "for several months, our public kerosene has been piled up in Lingbao, unable to find military wagons to transport it!" However, at the same time, the kerosene transported eastward by "merchants" through the railway bureau was continuously arriving in the market, with no real shortage. For such things, the reason is obvious?

On December 2nd, the director of the Longhai Railway Bureau was replaced by Mo Heng, who was transferred from Nanjing. People in the transportation industry seem to have high expectations for him. This new director inspected the line from Xuzhou to Xi'an. His first "diagnosis" was that the Longhai Railway was "born with deficiencies and acquired maladjustments." Based on this "diagnosis," we might as well let "time" test what the "prescription" will be tomorrow. However, in the few days before the new takeover, the railway schedule was considerably delayed. Some people say that this is a common phenomenon when "the baton is being passed." But to outsiders, it seems to be throwing a thorn at the "personnel system" of the railway, which has always been known as one of the three major systems along with the postal service and customs!

According to Mo's statement, "The Zhongmou section can be rushed to completion before the end of this year. In this way, train services can be increased west of Zhengzhou. Passenger and freight transportation west of Zhengzhou is expected to improve within three months, get on track in six months, and return to normal in one year." Given the length of the railway line in that section and the perfunctory nature of the current construction, if it can be normalized in one year, it will certainly be a major event in railway restoration.

"However," Mo made the following "proviso": "The supply of materials still needs to be resolved, because the source is either from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration or purchased by the government using credit loans. However, the former does not want to provide relief to the Longhai Railway because it is close to the war zone, and the latter, the purchase and transportation are not immediately feasible. Moreover, it is now deep winter, and all construction work must wait until next spring to begin. At present, we can only store materials..." The reporter records the above as it is, in order to verify it with the facts in three months, six months, and one year.

Looking further west from Lingbao, the Lintian (Shuishui) Railway, which was hastily started during the war and perfunctorily completed and "reported" after the war, is still not open to traffic. Statistics show that since the beginning of this year, the number of days that traffic was disrupted due to landslides has clearly exceeded the number of days that traffic was barely possible. (Since the major collapse this autumn, although active repairs have been carried out, it was originally planned to complete the work in early winter to facilitate the travel of merchants during the Lunar New Year. But judging from the situation, this possibility is extremely slim. If it cannot be repaired by the end of this month, it will be impossible to start due to ice and snow. What if we wait until the snow melts and the ice thaws next spring? That's even worse, because the increase in rainfall and the non-compliant slopes and roadbeds will only increase the number of collapses!

Looking further west, the preliminary work on the "Tianshui-Lanzhou" section has been done over the past few months using the "work-for-relief" method, but recently, due to the weather, the sky is covered with ice and snow, making it impossible to start work. We have to wait until the spring when the weather is warm and the flowers bloom to resume work. It is said that next year we will continue to use "work-for-relief" to recruit laborers. It is expected that it will take three years to complete the project in the most favorable circumstances.

Looking back east to the section from Xuzhou to Haizhou, it is said that track restoration has also begun. The details are not within the scope of this reporter's coverage, so they are omitted here.

### Japanese Land Reform

— Translated by Zhang Deqian from The Christian Science Monitor

The Japanese government's plan to break the feudal agricultural system, approved by the Allied Supreme Commander, has been initially decided to be announced. Most non-Japanese experts believe that this plan lacks the spirit of democratic reform and is insufficient as a means to break one of Japan's most undemocratic economic systems.

According to Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Wada's explanation to reporters, this new land reform bill is a kind of land economic revolution, the purpose of which is to eradicate the original autocratic system, because Japanese farmers have always been subjected to ruthless exploitation and forced to sell their labor cheaply, and used by urban industrialists. Therefore, it is proposed to divide large estates, assisted by the government, and resell them to small tenant farmers who have been enslaved by tyrannical landlords for hundreds of years.

Regarding this new bill, MacArthur expressed his opinion: "I am satisfied with the courage and determination shown by the current government to eradicate the ancient landlord system." MacArthur replied in a letter that the bill "will eliminate the pests of communism from the Japanese soil."

In fact, this new bill is only a redistribution of land. At least on paper), but according to qualified land experts here, the bill has many loopholes, and Japanese officials can arbitrarily reduce its original purpose of reform.

One expert here described the bill as "like building a fence to protect grain, to prevent wild rabbits, but only covering three sides."

In essence, the purpose of the land reform bill drafted by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry this time is to give tenants the opportunity to obtain four-fifths of the country's arable land. For example, if the bill can be fully implemented, more than 500 acres of the 650 acres of land currently cultivated by tenants will be owned by the tenants. At that time, only about one-tenth of all arable land in Japan will be tenanted land.

The Japanese government will purchase land from landlords at a price of 757 yen per dan (Japanese system: each dan is equal to one-fifth of an acre), and resell it to future owners with long-term loans. The former tenant farmers will pay about one-third of their annual harvest to the government for a period of 30 years, roughly equal to the land rent they should pay in peacetime.

The main loophole in the bill seems to be that it does not specify the amount of land that each family is allowed to own, nor does it specify the amount of land that tenants or "others" are allowed to purchase.

A few weeks ago, when MacArthur submitted the land reform issue to the United Nations Control Commission for Japan, the committee unanimously recommended that the land owned by any person should be limited to seven and a half acres, and that any excess should be redistributed and sold to other small landlords, so as to prevent rich farmers from taking the opportunity to purchase more land and hire workers to cultivate it.

Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Wada frankly told reporters yesterday that this plan "will not be implemented, whether now or in the future." He declared with great certainty that as long as farmers agree to cultivate the land themselves, the new bill does not prohibit them from buying large tracts of land.

The new bill also stipulates that self-cultivating farmers who own more than seven and a half acres of land do not need to sell their excess as long as they cultivate it properly. This clause is particularly biased towards large tracts of poorly cultivated land, because this kind of land is actually better distributed to small farmers who are in urgent need of land.

There is another loophole, that is, according to the provisions of the bill, the implementation of the land reform plan must be carried out mainly by the local committees, which are organized by an equal number of tenants and landlords.

If the current Japanese leaders really want to implement democratic reforms, this matter can be realized. But the current administrative authorities have a tendency to maintain the old system with all their strength, so the achievements of the committee will inevitably be difficult to meet expectations. Because Japanese tenants have been subjected to the tyranny of landlords for a long time, once they are asked to discuss matters together with the landlords, they will inevitably follow the landlords' lead. Even when things that cannot be resolved need to be transferred to the prefectural governor for handling, the prefectural governors are mostly backed by landlords, so they will still be detrimental to the tenants.

According to the Japanese government's estimate, when the entire reform plan is implemented, only 700 of the current 37 million tenant farmers will remain tenant farmers. However, according to Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Wada's statement to reporters yesterday, the government has not yet set up a separate budget agency for the plan, so there is no budget available at present. Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Wada also declared that the Japanese government will follow the provisions of the Allied Supreme Commander to complete the plan within two years, because MacArthur had endorsed the end of the bill, limiting the bill to be completed within two years.

According to Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Wada, there is no time limit in the original text of the bill, and its implementation depends on whether the local committees can abide by the original purpose of the bill. Therefore, the biggest weakness of the bill is that although there is a method of democratic land reform, it does not contain compulsion. Whether it can be realized depends on whether Japanese officials are faithful or not, and it is no different from other democratic reform bills that are just paper tigers. In fact, according to the feelings of most observers here, whether Japanese officials are faithful at present is still quite problematic.

### Masked Bandits Rob Steamship; A Word Provokes Fury, Soldier Shot

As the year enters winter, the security situation in Jiangxi Province is becoming increasingly serious. Not only do people feel uneasy when walking alone, but cars are also attacked when they break down. A two-amphibious jeep, after crossing Zhanggongdu, was also patronized by bandits. Then, two steamboats were robbed in the same area, on the Sanjiadian River, 15 miles from the outskirts of Nanchang. The silver and goods from the ship's accounting office, as well as the passengers' luggage, were all tied up and carried away by masked and disguised bandits, leaving no trace. A soldier of unknown name on the "Xin Yunsheng" steamer, seeing the bandits speaking with a provincial accent rampaging and robbing, said, "Comrades! Why do you have to do this?" These words provoked their anger, and he was shot dead. His body was pushed into the river, and another shot was fired.

Traveling in Jiangxi now really feels like "traveling is difficult." Chairman Wang Lingji traveled from Nanchang to Jiujiang and then to Nanjing one day. For the sake of security along the way, a large contingent of guards escorted him. This was not Yu Shi's ostentatious display of power, but mostly a practical necessity.

### Xinyu County Station Master Commits Suicide Due to Grain Shortage?

Jiangxi's actual grain collection this year has been underway since November. According to information from the Grain and Food Office, the amount collected by various counties and reported to the province totals 180,000 shi. Taihe and other counties have achieved better results. According to this proportion, it is possible to collect enough grain by the end of this year. It was previously rumored that the head of the Xinyu County Grain Transport Station committed suicide, reportedly because he owed too much grain (40,000 shi) and tried to hide in this way to shirk responsibility.

### Taichung Travels

— December 1st, Taipei Air Mail, Special Correspondent for Taiwan, Yang Yu

For someone arriving from within the country, Taipei City, as the political and economic center of Taiwan, seems to offer sufficient spiritual satisfaction. However, if you venture out from here and explore every corner of the verdant island, I dare say your heart will be filled with even newer things. On the morning of the 27th, I packed a simple bag and boarded a train heading towards the western plains of the solid island, embarking on a short trip to Taichung.

Coastal Scenery, Deep Azure

The coastal railway stretches westward, parallel to the Taiwan Strait. Sometimes they are far apart, and sometimes they embrace each other. White sand, green pines, and blue waters peek shyly through the train windows. I especially love the large streams filled with sparkling pebbles, slowly flowing towards the vast, misty sea from under the high bridges, tens of meters away from the train. A stone, a blade of grass, a tree – here, they all become poetic embellishments. It's already December, but the warm, gentle spring breeze still caresses you.

The wide streams, such as Dakekan Creek, Dadu Creek, Dajia Creek, and Dagai Creek, drain westward from the towering mountains, creating a fertile western plain rich in rice and sugarcane. Although the current is not rapid now, and some even clearly show dried riverbeds, a heavy rain can cause the water to surge rapidly, like thousands of troops galloping and flooding everywhere. To prevent such disasters, many riverbanks are protected by concrete retaining walls. Chief Chen has recently emphasized afforestation. To truly protect the fertile western plains and reclaim barren land, a permanent and large-scale protective forest should be established in the upper reaches of the streams. Simply relying on retaining walls is not enough.

The coastal railway runs directly from Taipei to Tainan and Kaohsiung. To reach Taichung, you need to change trains at Changhua. Although the journey into the Taichung Basin is only a short half hour, the deep azure coastal scenery transforms into the green of vegetables and the yellow of rice paddies, a rural landscape.

Cultural City, Infinite Tranquility

From the gate of the station, I began to encounter Taichung City, the sixth largest city in Taiwan, known as "Little Kyoto" and a "Japanese-style model city," bringing a sense of infinite tranquility. It has always maintained its leisurely demeanor. The railway line divides it into two parts: the industrial area to the east and the bustling city area between the Luchuan and Liuchuan Rivers to the west. In fact, it is incredibly quiet. On the glossy asphalt roads, only the sparse sounds of footsteps can be heard. Tropical palm trees sway in the breeze, carrying a refreshing fragrance. In the past, everyone called this a cultural city. Indeed, there are many well-established primary and secondary schools, and dozens of public and private libraries... but what about now? Take bookstores, for example. A man who has lived in Taichung for twenty-one years opened a large Lixing Bookstore, but it only has twenty or thirty books of poor quality. Other bookstores, such as Central Bookstore and Cultural Bookstore, also fail to offer any worthwhile books, unless you search in second-hand bookstores. Although the war brought misfortune to this cultural capital, the damage was relatively light. The magnificent primary and secondary schools are already filled with the sounds of the national anthem every morning. "Thunderstorm" is being staged here, and Lin Henian's concert has attracted many listeners. The revival of the cultural capital seems to have begun. In such a beautiful environment, I hope everyone will spread the new seeds of culture as much as possible!

Walking the streets at night, the once bustling "Rongcho" and "Jincho" have been renamed Zhongshan Road, Zhongzheng Road, and Ziyou Road. Although the shops are brightly lit, the number of customers is pitiful. Sitting in the "Red Wing Tea Room," under the dim light reflecting on the potted plants, listening to a segment of "The Blue Danube," this kind of sentiment makes me feel an extraordinary love and longing for this cultural capital!

The Scent of Wine Everywhere, Drooling

There are a total of thirty-four state-owned wineries under the Monopoly Bureau throughout Taiwan, distributed in Taipei, Taichung, Tainan, Taitung, Chiayi, and Hualien Harbor. The largest is the Banqiao Winery in Taipei, followed by one next to Fuxing Road on the east side of the Taichung Railway. I took some time to visit it once. In the past, the Taichung Monopoly Bureau and the winery were combined, but they were separated in August of this year. The Monopoly Bureau is responsible for the distribution of monopoly goods, while the winery focuses on production and manufacturing.

Section Chief Chen of the winery first led the reporter to the workshop where "Bailu Wine" is made. The factory, established more than twenty years ago, looks very old from the outside. Moreover, the war did not spare it, as a bomb was dropped next to it. After the retrocession, it was repaired and put into operation for a period of time. However, it has now been shut down again due to damage. "Bailu Wine" is commonly called rice wine. The raw material is rice, with added sugar or honey for fermentation. In the fermentation room, there are fourteen large iron vats. After the rice and sugar are placed inside for more than ten days of fermentation, countless iron pipes carry the initially brewed wine to the distillation room for rigorous distillation. Because there are many impurities mixed in, the distilled wine is then transferred to a copper-colored boiler for filtration. After these steps, the rice wine is made, and then it flows from the pipes into large vats in the warehouse for storage. It can be transferred to the packaging room for bottling at any time. Because the production method relies mostly on machinery, not many workers are employed. In total, there are about two hundred people in the entire winery. The alcohol content of rice wine is 22%, which may be a bit strong for the average person. Although this part of the factory has been shut down for a long time, after turning around a few times inside, I could smell the pungent aroma of wine everywhere. Those old drunkards who believe "one cup in hand, all worries are gone" would undoubtedly drool here.

Currently, they are manufacturing "Fragrant Wine," which contains 17% alcohol. The process is a bit more complicated. Although the raw material is also rice, it must be carefully selected and whitened. It is first soaked in water and then taken out to make koji. Then it is fermented in many large iron vats. After that, the specially stored alcohol is piped into it. In this way, the wine can be made after only eight or nine days. However, because the purity of the alcohol is very low, there is a risk of bacteria and spoilage. Therefore, after the initial production, it is filtered and then passed through a boiling water furnace with a very high temperature to kill the bacteria before being transferred to the storage room. However, once it reaches the large vats in the storage room, it must stay there for two months before it can be taken out for bottling.

Daily Wine Production, Two Hundred Metric Tons

The bottling room is filled with the roar of machines, and the clanging of bottles is deafening. At one end of the machine, a female worker places rows of empty bottles on the racks. They are rolled into the machine layer by layer and take several baths in cold and hot water. When they come out from the other end, they are still neatly arranged. Then they mechanically move forward, passing a female worker who specializes in inspecting the bottles. Then, one by one, they are guided onto a filling machine, filled, and then moved to another capping machine to be capped. At this time, many female workers put them into a large machine and take another steam bath. You might think this is the last sterilization and disinfection, right? Actually, no. After they come out dripping wet, they must go through another female worker who uses an electric light to carefully check them for cracks and impurities before the labels are applied manually and they are packaged. It is said that in the past, labeling and packaging were also done by machines.

With such high-speed production, two hundred metric tons of finished products can be produced every day, which can fill twelve thousand bottles of wine. However, sales have not been as good as in the past, because many people do not fully understand the nature of the monopoly business, resulting in the prevalence of illegal wine, which has become a major obstacle. In the past, when the Japanese ruled Taiwan, 79% of the fiscal revenue relied on the monopoly business, but now we are lamenting the difficulties of the monopoly business. The difference is immeasurable. Where do we even begin?

### Brick and Tile Industry in Jiangnan

— Sixth Dispatch, Special Correspondent for Hangzhou, Chu Yusheng

The Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway line, the great artery of Jiangnan, is indeed worthy of being called abundant. However, it only has achievements in agriculture, while its industry appears very fragile. Besides the silk factories in Chang'an and Jiaxing, the weaving and sock factories in Xiashi, the silk screen factories in Hangzhou, the paper factory in Jiaxing, and the brick and tile industry in Jiashan, there is simply nothing else to introduce. After the victory of the War of Resistance, this fragile industry not only did not recover but also appeared even more desolate and declining. There is no way to export silk, and domestic sales are also difficult. The same is true for cloth, socks, and paper. Moreover, a large number of foreign goods are sold in the Chinese market, bringing this small, vulnerable industry on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line to a serious crisis.

However, the brick and tile industry seems to be able to raise its head at this time, because the widespread destruction in the country urgently needs construction, and the housing shortage everywhere urgently needs the construction of residences. Moreover, foreigners are definitely unwilling to transport bricks to China for sale, because bricks and tiles are bulky, which is very uneconomical in principle.

Seven Kiln Areas

The production of bricks and tiles in Jiashan began during the Hongwu reign of the Ming Dynasty. By the late Qing Dynasty, with the opening of the Shanghai and Hangzhou concessions, the demand for bricks and tiles increased dramatically. Around the tenth year of the Republic, there were company organizations. By the twentieth year, fifteen brick and tile companies had been established in the county. At that time, the transportation and sale of bricks and tiles spread throughout Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, making it the center of the Jiangnan brick and tile industry. The Jiashan market also prospered considerably.

The county can be divided into seven kiln areas. At its peak, there were more than seven hundred kilns in operation, and farmers engaged in brickmaking as a side business accounted for more than 80%. The kiln areas are Yuhai, Fanjing, Xiadianmiao, Tianrenzhuang, Hongjiatan, Qingliang'an, and Qianyao. All seven of these areas have small ports for transportation. Boats travel from morning to noon. Later, motorized boats converted from rowing boats began to operate, making transportation convenient. There are about seven hundred and fifty kiln owners, one hundred and twenty-five brick traders, and brickmakers account for about 80% of the population in the kiln areas. Brick and tile blanks are mostly made by local farmers. The source of brick clay is Lunan in Jiashan and the southern countryside of Jiaxing, as well as Luxu in Wujiang, Jiangsu. The types and quality of bricks and tiles produced in these seven kiln areas are different, so their sales areas are also different. For example, Yuhai produces No. 2 bricks, Dingsheng, and Huangdao, which are sold in Suzhou and Jiaxing. Fanjing produces No. 3 bricks, Huangdao, and paving bricks, which are sold in Pudong, Shanghai. Xiadianmiao produces No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3 bricks, which are sold in Shanghai. Tianren produces No. 3 bricks, large and small tiles, and paving bricks, which are sold in Hangzhou and other ports in the interior. Hongxi produces No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3 bricks, large and small tiles, and square bricks, of which 70% are sold in Shanghai and 30% in other ports in the interior. Qingliang'an produces No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3 bricks, Dingsheng, and Huangdao, of which 80% are sold in Shanghai and 20% in other ports in the interior. Qianyao produces No. 3 bricks and flat tiles, which are sold in major cities and the surrounding countryside of the county.

Kiln Distribution

As for the distribution of kilns: Yuhai has eighty-three, Fanjing has sixty-five, Xiadianmiao has one hundred and twenty-four, Tianren has one hundred and twenty-one, Hongxi has two hundred and forty-five, Qingliang has thirty-three, and Qianyao has one hundred and fifty-six, for a total of eight hundred and twenty-seven. Before the war, almost none of these eight hundred and twenty-seven kilns were owned by brickmaking workers or kiln workers. They were all built by people with some money, who hired people to make bricks and operate the kilns during the farmers' off-season. These kiln workers did not consider it their main occupation but rather a source of side income. The work process is very simple: after the mud is brought in, it is put into a grid-shaped blank mold to make blanks, and then the blanks are carried to the place where they are fired. The kiln looks like a cemetery hill, with a chimney standing on top. The kiln workers put the blanks inside and burn them with straw and coal ash. During the firing process, water carriers constantly carry water and climb to the top of the kiln to pour water on the bricks below. The kiln workers have to enter the kiln to take out the fired bricks. In the heat of summer, some kiln workers would faint on the ground after coming out of the kiln because the temperature inside was too high. After the bricks are made, they are loaded onto boats and transported to the market for sale.

After the victory of the War of Resistance, because of the widespread war damage, many people who wanted to build houses were hesitant. At the same time, the instability of land and housing prices also made those with intentions hesitant to move forward. The countryside was devastated, and many people could not even cultivate their fields. Who would bother with the meager profits of brickmaking? As a result, many kilns stopped smoking, and the brick and tile industry was on the verge of bankruptcy.

Improving the Kiln Industry

Based on what we have said above, we know that in the past, the kiln industry was in the hands of the kiln owners, and the workers who directly produced the bricks had no share. At this time when the brick and tile industry is on the verge of bankruptcy, we thought of a better way, which is to support the kiln workers in developing the kiln industry. Because bricks and tiles are transferred by brick traders and kiln owners, the cost has increased and exploitation has intensified. The kiln workers who directly produce the bricks and the engineers who directly build the houses are both subjected to unreasonable exploitation. We might as well bring the people in the construction industry and the brick and tile workers together to eliminate the middlemen's profits. People who are preparing to build can lend money to the kiln workers who produce the bricks, and the kiln workers can produce and supply the bricks to the people who are building. Wouldn't that be great? But this is closer to the ideal. In this complex society, there are more people who are eager for quick success and instant benefits than those who uphold justice for the public. If we want to do this, we must put politics on the right track and use the power of politics to support the kiln workers before there is a way. Otherwise, we ask the government to use relief materials and lend money directly to the kiln workers so that they can produce directly. If the kiln owners do not cooperate, the government can build new-style kilns and purchase machines from abroad to start firing kilns. I think this huge expense can be solved within the relief materials. This is true relief for the toiling masses, and truly revitalizing the brick and tile industry in Jiashan. Because the kiln owners' intermediate profits prevent the kiln workers from benefiting and make builders feel that the price of bricks and tiles is too high, which affects the construction industry, affects the kiln workers' work enthusiasm, and affects the improvement and development of the brick and tile industry.

Kiln Industry Organization

Now, some enlightened people in Jiashan are carrying out kiln industry organization and have begun to demand kiln industry loans. I think the appeal for kiln industry loans is appropriate, but the loans should be lent to the workers. During the War of Resistance, so many destroyed places need to be rebuilt. In a province like Zhejiang, there are also a large number of calls for building houses. If the brick and tile industry is exploited by middlemen and the cost is increased, it will be a huge threat to the millions of people who have no houses to live in. Do we still want to wait for foreign bricks and tiles to be transported to China to build houses on Chinese land in order to alleviate the Chinese housing shortage?

### Random Notes from the "Liberated Area"

A cadre in charge of struggle returned home at night and was picked up and thrown into a well. Because the well was small and the person was positioned horizontally, he did not sink to the bottom. The next day, several water carriers rescued him. It was obvious that this was a reflection of his struggle, but the cadres insisted that it was done by special agents. Thus, the "Serving the People" anti-espionage movement was launched, and the people there were arrested en masse. In these years of being arrested and released, it is unknown how many people died or were maimed. In the families of those arrested, it is unknown how many fled, were scattered, or were even "hit by guerrilla warfare" by those cadres (meaning men and women cohabiting). I personally saw two doctors named Ma being detained for a year and two months by those cadres for "not understanding." I also personally saw those cadres, as if joking, drag five people out to be shot. One of the young men wanted to speak, but the cadres used the butt of a gun to hit him hard on the head. In the instant that the red blood stained the black iron, the young man's head drooped, and his legs gave way. At this time, those cadres dragged him to their never-fixed execution ground like dragging a dead dog. These five people who were killed had not been subjected to a so-called public trial beforehand, nor had a single word been announced afterward. This kind of unexplained death is really too miserable! (Zhu Xiaotian)

### Yugoslavia's Dictator Tito: Opportunistic, Once Helped Tsarist Troops Fight the Red Army

— Translated from the American Chronicle by Cassini

For millions of Serbians, Croatians, Slavs, and the vast masses outside the Iron Curtain, the name "Tito" is a symbol of terror, a madman worshiping communist ideals.

Tito launched a brutal campaign in the Balkans to sanctify communism and for political purposes. Although he suffered a bad reputation internationally because of this campaign, he has become the ruler of millions of innocent people under Stalin's support, a "obedient" puppet leader of the Kremlin.

If his master Stalin were to trace Tito's background—Tito's former name was J. Broz—a former leader of the White Russian anti-communists—then Tito's face would be as red as the flag he is holding high and the "bloody hands" he used to kill people.

Originally Anti-Communist

No matter how Tito—Broz—boasts of his pure communist background, he was not born speaking Russian. He is a Croatian Catholic—and still a Catholic—who was an anti-communist when he first emerged. His father and mother were God-fearing Croatian farmers. If they were still alive to see Tito's great achievements in killing people, they would scold him and drown him.

Changed His Name Three Times

Tito wants to put a period of his life from 1915 to 1920 behind him, because during this period he participated in the Austro-Hungarian army on the Soviet-Russian front to resist revolutionary troops. In 1915, he was captured and sent to Siberia. According to his own account, he was indeed captured, but some say he defected to the Soviet Union.

At that time, the Tsar was persuading the Slavs to rebel against the central government and organized South Czech volunteer troops to help the Imperial Russian army fight. However, Tito only recently denied to an American journalist that he had ever participated in the South Slavic army.

General Graves, the leader of the American Expeditionary Force in Siberia, wrote a book. In this book, there is a photograph with several French, American, British, and Japanese officers, as well as a Major Broz (i.e., Tito) wearing the uniform of the White Russian army. This book proves that Tito's loyalty to the Communist Party is impossible.

What Tito did from 1915 to 1920 cannot be told. However, during this period, the historian Alexander Tai Shanzi, in his book "Tsars and Presidents," which describes the relationship between the United States and Russia from 1777 to 1917, has the following description:

When the March Revolution broke out in 1917, Broz (i.e., Tito) was still far away in Siberia. When Austria collapsed in November 1918, Tito was in the South Slavic army, an officer in the anti-communist home of General Kolchak. After the collapse of General Kolchak's rule, Tito defected to the Red Army. This time Tito's transformation was no different from his previous defection from Austria to the Tsar.

In the above photograph (which is still in our hands), Tito has a Chaplin-style mustache, and his hair has temporarily fallen out due to typhus, but his face is still the same as it is now. Tito emphatically denied the fact that he participated in the Spanish Civil War, but his friend at that time, Maier Nalux, said: Broz served as the political commissar of the Lukacs army (belonging to the International Army), at that time Tito's name was "Antonio."

Tito's entire career seems to have benefited from changing his name, beliefs, and doctrines. Finally, he went from a completely pure clergyman to Yugoslavia and was expelled from the church.

Now communism is powerful, but who knows what new ideas tomorrow will bring, causing Tito, Broz, Antonio, plus a new name, to seek the protection of the church and deal a serious blow to Stalin?

The Changeable Tito

Having changed his name twice, first a clergyman, then joined the anti-communist army, now pro-communist, the diagram shows Tito wearing the uniform of the anti-communist army in 1918, planning how to destroy the communist army.

### Southwest Africa

— Zuo Qi

At the Second General Assembly of the United Nations, the Prime Minister of the Union of South Africa, Smuts, proposed the annexation of Southwest Africa, which was opposed by China, the Soviet Union, and several Eastern European countries.

South West Africa borders the Union of South Africa to the south, Portuguese West Africa to the north, the British Bechuanaland Protectorate to the east, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west, with an area of approximately 835,000 square kilometers. When various European powers explored Africa in the mid-19th century, this area was designated as a sphere of influence by Germany. At the Berlin Conference in 1884, it was agreed to be a German protectorate. It was occupied by the Union of South Africa army in 1915 during the European War. After the European War, it was entrusted to the Union of South Africa for trusteeship. (Walvis Bay on the Atlantic coast of Southwest Africa, and the surrounding area of more than 1,100 square kilometers, has belonged to Great Britain since 1878 and is managed by South Africa.)

The interior of Southwest Africa is dry land, suitable for livestock raising. Cereals are produced along the coast. In recent years, diamond and copper mines have been discovered in the territory. The capital, Windhoek, has a thriving livestock industry, and the railway extends to the coast.

### U.S. Government Actively Promotes Pacific Base Plan

— Translated by Xi from the New York Times

The issue of American bases in the Pacific has now become a major key to the future of the United Nations. World attention is focused on this, and it is also a major difficulty for the future "peace treaty with Japan," which is extremely closely related to our country. This article is a special commentary from the New York Times, and is translated here.

U.S. President Truman's proposal to place the Japanese mandated islands in the Pacific under the trusteeship of the United Nations, with the United States as the sole administrative authority, has broad implications for the United Nations and the U.S. relationship with other powers.

The islands involved in this proposal include three major categories: the Mariana Islands, the Caroline Islands, and the Marshall Islands. However, in addition to the former Japanese mandated territories, there is another category of Pacific islands, such as Okinawa and Iwo Jima, which are Japanese territories that may become important American military outposts. Therefore, whenever the United States discusses strategic bases in the Pacific, it inevitably involves these islands.

The mandated areas that the United States proposes to place under conditional trusteeship were originally German territory, and were entrusted to Japan by the League of Nations after World War I. However, Japan violated the terms of the mandate and established powerful defensive bases in that million-square-mile area.

Pacific Security

Now, in order to safeguard its position in the Pacific, the United States has driven Japan out of these fortresses. The United States is unwilling to give up these islands easily without obtaining guarantees that they can be used as military bases. Not only that, although the U.S. government has begun to discuss the trusteeship issue internally, the Navy Department has already selected locations that can be used as bases and is proceeding with plans to build them. Construction work on Guam is actively underway, and the breakwater being built in Apra Harbor is nearing completion, costing millions of dollars. At the same time, the deployment of naval, land, and air forces is being arranged.

Admiral Nimitz, Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific Fleet, recently announced a grand plan to build Guam into a base as important, or even as large, as Pearl Harbor. Pearl Harbor is 4,000 miles east of Guam, and the two major bases face each other from a distance, controlling the entire Pacific. However, according to the Navy Department, Guam should not be an isolated American outpost as it was in the past, but the core of a vast fortress network, with the Aleutian Islands, the Hawaiian Islands, American Samoa, the Palau Islands, the westernmost Caroline Islands, and Okinawa and Iwo Jima as its outer sentinels. Uleithi Island in the Palau Islands has been used as a fleet anchorage since it was recaptured by the U.S. Navy. Truk Island in the Caroline Islands was originally a Japanese naval fortress and was later used for the same purpose by the U.S. Navy.

U.S. military leaders and government authorities have given lengthy consideration to the possibility that the United States will lose control of strategic bases after the Pacific mandated territories are placed under the trusteeship of the United Nations. As a result, they believe that the United States should not only incorporate the Japanese mandated territories, but also retain Okinawa in the Ryukyu Islands, Iwo Jima in the Ogasawara Islands, and other islands deemed necessary for security.

Strategic Area Trusteeship

The U.S. proposal is based on the provisions of the United Nations Charter, which allows countries to establish "strategic area" trusteeships under the Security Council rather than the Trusteeship Council. Article 83 of the United Nations Charter stipulates: "All functions of the United Nations relating to strategic areas, including the approval of the terms of the trusteeship agreement and their alteration or amendment, shall be exercised by the Security Council."

After establishing this jurisdiction, the article also allows the Trusteeship Council to exercise very limited powers in strategic areas and authorizes the Security Council to consult the Trusteeship Council on political, economic, social, and educational matters within strategic areas. However, this action by the Security Council shall be subject to the terms of the trusteeship agreement; that is, the United States, as the initiator of the agreement, has the final say in this matter.

Blocking Base Areas

According to the U.S. plan, the United States has the right to refuse the Trusteeship Council access to the "blocked base areas" within the trust territory. This can be regarded as an American military base, and sometimes as the entire trust territory. The trusteeship agreements proposed by the U.S. State Department and other trusteeship proposals, such as those proposed by the United Kingdom and France regarding certain territories in East Africa, differ in this aspect. The introduction of the "Strategic Area Agreement" to the United Nations began with this U.S. plan.

This plan preserves the special rights of the United States in the blocked areas, which, in the eyes of Americans, is sufficient to guarantee the security of the United States in key areas of the Pacific. However, there will certainly be objections in the Security Council. It must be known that the passage of a proposal in that council requires unanimous consent.

First, some may raise the question: Is the United States asking for nominal trusteeship, or actual annexation? In terms of the content of the U.S. proposal, the United States is in the position of the administrative authority, holding "full administrative, legislative, and judicial powers," and the administered territory becomes part of the United States. However, the U.S. State Department explains that the rigid wording in the agreement is only used to illustrate the special terminology of American administrative power.

Second, there may also be objections to the U.S. proposal to prohibit foreign aircraft from flying over the trust territory, except as specifically agreed.

Focus of Controversy

However, the biggest reaction is likely to be to the provision on blocked base defense areas. Taking the Soviet Union as an example, even if it is not surprised by this part of the proposal, it can almost be certain that it will never agree to it. The Soviet Union has always been very concerned about the U.S. position in the Pacific, and it is feared that it will be difficult to tolerate the U.S. plan to establish secret fortresses within bombing range of the Soviet border. The Soviet Union will regard the U.S. proposal for the mandated islands as the fate determined by President Truman for any Japanese islands to be managed by the United States after World War II.

The ultimate fate of these islands depends on the resolutions of the peace conference. So far, the United States has not made any demands. A U.S. Navy Department spokesman insisted that these islands are of great importance to security. Those who agree with this view argue that Okinawa and Iwo Jima, which the United States sacrificed countless lives to obtain, should be "incorporated" into the United States.

The United Nations is very clear about the substantial interests of the United States in these Japanese islands and will certainly not forget this when discussing the U.S. trusteeship agreement in the future.

Current Affairs Commentary

### International Progress: Post-War Cooperation Among the Powers Still Possible

— Chu Yukun

In this week, the international atmosphere has once again been filled with compromise. After lengthy discussions on the issue of arms reduction, the United Nations General Assembly has repeatedly put forward compromise solutions. Finally, the opinions of the five major powers, China, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, have gradually converged. The only remaining issue is the veto power, with the Soviet Union still insisting on the principle of unanimity among the five powers and refusing to budge. In addition, the various countries have different methods for restricting the exercise of the veto power by the five powers, so it is still a major issue in the international arena.

However, the Council of Foreign Ministers, after several meetings, has achieved significant results. The foreign ministers of the four countries have reached a complete agreement on the draft peace treaties with Italy, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Finland, which were passed by the Paris Peace Conference. Not only have French officials expressed satisfaction with this, but also the Soviet political commentator Zhukov published an article in "Pravda" praising it, saying, "Judging from the success of the Council of Foreign Ministers, it can be seen that the four powers working together is still possible." However, the Council of Foreign Ministers did not thoroughly discuss the German issue because France insisted that it should not be discussed before Foreign Minister Bidault arrived in New York. Therefore, the last meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers is scheduled to be held on the 21st of this month, and it is feared that it will still not be able to discuss it.

Merger of Two Occupation Zones

Although the Council of Foreign Ministers has not been able to discuss the German issue, the economic merger of the British and American occupation zones was signed in New York by the foreign ministers of the two countries and will be implemented from January 1 next year. The contents of this agreement can be summarized as follows: (1) The common goal is to enable Germany to become self-sufficient by 1949; (2) The import and export trade of the two occupation zones after the merger will be resolved by the Joint Anglo-American Committee; (3) To raise the living standards of the residents in the two occupation zones, especially to increase the amount of food rations; (4) If the import and export trade cannot be balanced, the amount of the import surplus will be borne equally by the two countries.

Although this agreement is limited to the United Kingdom and the United States, according to the intentions of Foreign Minister Bevin and Secretary of State Byrnes, it is hoped that France and the Soviet Union can also participate. However, France believes that this agreement is purely technical in nature and has not solved the entire issue, so it refuses to participate and declares that France's position on Germany remains unchanged. As for the Soviet Union, it remains silent. Therefore, the solution to the German issue can only be hoped for when the Council of Foreign Ministers is convened next year.

Rumors of an Anglo-American Alliance Grow Louder

The British Communist Party's Daily Worker suddenly reported that the United Kingdom and the United States are about to conclude a military alliance treaty. This news shocked the world. Although the British War Office denied it, the doubts in the hearts of the world have not been dispelled. Even Labour MP Zilliacus, in a speech at the Anglo-Soviet Association on the 8th, opposed the conclusion of an Anglo-American alliance. He said, "The negotiations currently being conducted by the United Kingdom and the United States will inevitably result in the establishment of an alliance to prepare for a third world war against the Soviet Union. This secret diplomacy is no different from the Anglo-French Entente that was established on the eve of the First World War." Afterwards, he appealed to the British Labour Cabinet to treat the United States and the Soviet Union equally and not to show any favoritism.

From this, it can be seen that the rumors of an Anglo-American alliance are growing louder. We should not want this unfavorable rumor to become a reality. Because the current world is still at a crossroads, if the United Kingdom and the United States form an alliance to oppose the Soviet Union, then the post-war world being divided into "two worlds" will be unavoidable. And in the confrontation between the "two worlds," there can be no true peace.

### Heavy Workload Shortens Lifespan: Being President Is Not Easy

— Translated by Lan

Here we reprint an interesting table from the statistical bulletin of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. We think that this table is worth reading for everyone.

This table records three facts about every U.S. president except Hoover and Truman: their age at the time of their inauguration, the life expectancy estimated at that time, and their actual age at the time of death.

Messrs. Hoover and Truman are still living well with us today, so the records for them are of course incomplete.

After looking at this table, we can know that being the president of the United States is a job that shortens one's life.

This table should be studied in three parts: (1) Those who took office before 1850 – from Washington to Fillmore; (2) Those who took office between 1850 and 1901 – from Fillmore to Theodore Roosevelt; (3) Presidents after Theodore Roosevelt.

In the first group, the presidents from Washington to Tyler lived an average of 2.9 years longer than their estimated life expectancy.

In the second group, three presidents, Lincoln, Garfield, and McKinley, were assassinated, and therefore cannot be included in the calculation. As for the rest, they were the opposite of the first group, living an average of 2.9 years shorter than their estimated life expectancy.

Finally, speaking of the presidents who have died in the 20th century, we find that, with the exception of Taft, their lifespans were all significantly shorter than the estimates made at the time of their inauguration, with an average difference of more than eight years.

Of course, as the statisticians at Metropolitan Life Insurance Company point out, "One cannot simply infer from these numbers that the position of president today shortens the life of the president from the date of inauguration, but these numbers do exist. Regardless of the reason, the fact is that presidents before 1850 lived longer than their estimated life expectancy at the time of their inauguration, presidents between 1850 and 1901 lived an average of 2.9 years shorter, and after 1901, they died an average of eight years earlier than their reasonably predicted life expectancy."

It is well known that the office of president is an incredibly arduous job, even for broad-minded and self-confident people like Harding and Roosevelt, and its onerousness is increasing day by day. All of this is sufficient to support a suggestion we have made before, that every presidential candidate should undergo a thorough physical examination before the election.

The purpose of doing this is to ensure, as far as possible, that the voters do not elect someone who is about to die, as they did when they thrice elected Roosevelt in 1944.

Or, going a step further, as has been repeatedly suggested, to amend the constitution to limit each president to only one six-year term. There is absolutely no possibility of re-election or re-election after a period of retirement.

The advantage of this one-term limit is that it allows each president to focus on working for the welfare of the entire people in the White House, without being distracted by political activities aimed at planning for re-election. In fact, every president is now doing this.

In any case, we believe that the table above strongly supports the belief that "the office of president is a killer." The next inference is that the president is only a position that can be held by a person who is healthy and energetic, and in addition, he should also have a reasonably long life expectancy.

Spring and Autumn

### In the Ancient Castle of Combourg

— Written by François-René de Chateaubriand, Translated by Dachun

In the Castle of Combourg, there lived four masters: the father, the mother, the elder sister, and myself. Our servants included these: a cook, a maid, two male servants, and a groundskeeper. In addition to these, there was also a hunting dog and two old mares, confined in a corner of the sheds.

My father would rise every day at four o’clock, even in winter. After rising, he would walk to the entrance of the tower stairs in the inner courtyard and call to wake his servants. At five o’clock, coffee would be brought to him. After breakfast, he would sit and work in his study until noon. My mother and sister would each take breakfast in their own rooms at eight in the morning. I had no fixed time; I would rise and take breakfast at no set time; I would pretend to study until noon; for most of the time, I would do nothing.

At half past eleven, the lunch bell was rung, but the meal was only served at noon. The main hall served two purposes, as a dining hall and as a living room. We ate lunch and dinner sitting on the east end of the hall, and after the meal, we moved to the other end - the west end, to sit in front of a large fireplace.

After we finished lunch, we would all remain there together until two o’clock. After two, when it was summer, my father’s pastimes were nothing more than fishing, inspecting the vegetable garden, or taking walks around the castle; in autumn and winter, he would go hunting. My mother, on the other hand, would go to the family chapel to recite scriptures, which would take several hours...

After my father left and my mother went to recite scriptures, my sister, Lucille, would lock herself in her room, and I would return to my little room, or wander aimlessly in the countryside.

At eight o’clock, the bell announced dinner. After dinner, on clear days, we would sit on the stone steps. My father would take his shotgun and shoot at the owls that emerged from the battlements at dusk. My mother, Lucille, and I would gaze at the sky, the forest, the last of the sunlight, and the emerging constellations. At ten o’clock, we would return indoors to sleep.

Autumn and winter evenings were spent in a different way. After finishing dinner, the four of us retreated from the dining table to near the fireplace. My mother would lie sighing on an old couch made of Siamese silk; in front of her was placed a one-legged round table, upon which a candle was lit. Lucille and I would sit by the fireplace. The servants would clear away the dishes and withdraw from the hall. My father would begin to pace back and forth until bedtime. He wore a white crepe dressing gown, almost a greatcoat, which enveloped him, and I could scarcely see him. His bald head was neatly covered with a large white brimless cap. He would leave the fireplace and walk in the hall, illuminated by that single candle. When he walked away, we could barely see him, hearing only the sound of his footsteps in the gloom; then, slowly, he would pace back into the light, gradually emerging from the darkness, like a ghost, dressed in a white gown, wearing a white cap, his long face pale. When he was at the other end of the hall, Lucille and I would speak a few words softly; when he drew near, we would stop. As he walked past us, he would ask: "What are you saying?" We would be choked with fear, not answering him; he would continue walking. During the rest of the evening, we would only hear the sound of his measured footsteps, my mother's sighs, and the wind.

When the castle clock struck ten, my father would stop, and when the hammer of the clock striking the clockwork stopped, it seemed as though his feet were also suspended. My father would feel for his watch, wind it, take a large candlestick with a large candle lit upon it, and go to the west wing (Note 1), then return, holding the candle, to his bedroom in the east wing. Lucille and I would stand in the place where he was sure to pass, to embrace him and wish him a good night's sleep. He would lower his dry and sunken cheeks, say nothing, and continue on his way, reaching the bottom of the stairs, we would hear him close the door behind him.

That mood that had been interrupted—Mother, Sister and I, when Father was present, were all turned into statues, was now restored. The most important thing was to break our restraints, to open our mouths and begin talking.

We would talk for a while, and I would summon the maid to escort my mother and sister to their rooms. Before I left, they would always ask me to look under the bed, in the fireplace, behind the door, on the stairs, in the passageway, and in the nearby corridors. Because this castle had many legends, of thieves and ghosts, which often occupied their minds. The residents believed that there was once a Count of Combourg, who had died three centuries ago, who for a time often appeared with a wooden leg. Some people had met him at the foot of the grand staircase of the keep. Sometimes, it was only his wooden leg and a black robe that came out for a walk. These legends would always come to my mother and sister's minds when they slept, and they would be half-dead with fear when they were in bed. I would inspect the place for them and then go to my small tower; the cook would go to sleep in the main building, and the male servants would descend to the dungeon where they lived.

The window of my small tower opened onto the inner courtyard. During the day, I could see the raised section of the opposite castle facade in the distance, where several Scolopendrium (Note 2) and a wild plum tree grew. Every summer, a few sand martins would cry as they flew into the holes in the walls; they were my only companions. At night, I could only see a small patch of sky and a few stars. When the moon shone and its light penetrated the rhomboid glass of the window, casting its image upon my bed, then I knew that it had set in the west. At that time, the owls would fly from that tower to this tower, passing and repassing between the moon and myself, the shadows of their wings dancing on my tapestries. I slept in the most desolate part of the wilderness. No sound of the wind would be lost to my ears. Sometimes, the wind seemed to be moving with light steps; sometimes, it made sounds of resentment, and suddenly my door would shake violently, and a roar would come from the dungeon. These sounds would stop for a moment, and then come again after a while.

At four o’clock in the morning, my father would call to his servants at the entrance to the centuries-old arched section, as if the voices of the last ghosts of the night. This sound seemed to me comparable to the harmony with which Montaigne's father would awaken his son (Note 3).

Note 1: The father's study was in the west wing, and his bedroom in the east wing.

Note 2: A fern plant that resembles a tongue.

Note 3: Montaigne's father would play music in the morning to wake his son.

### An Inch of Territory, An Inch of Blood 119

— Ye Jingfeng

He Jian was still wearing that suit. As soon as he got off the train at Matsushima, he hired a taxi and drove straight to Tianmu Village, so as not to startle the passersby. When he arrived at the edge of the village, He Jian got out of the car and walked along the secluded path behind the mountain to Mrs. Xiaoyuan's residence. The scenery here was exactly the same as He Jian had seen six years ago, without any change. Besides the maid who opened the door, the first person to greet He Jian was Juzi; Mrs. Xiaoyuan's daughter, a twenty-six-year-old young widow.

"Oh!" Juzi exclaimed with surprise and joy, "Why didn't you send a letter first?" She wanted to say something else, but seeing the fatigue on He Jian's face, she swallowed all the words she wanted to say and wiped her tears with her sleeve.

Juzi can be said to be a typical Japanese woman, with a mind that is neither new nor old, just keeping up with the general society of Japan, moving at the same pace. She is not beautiful, but she is not repulsive; she finished junior normal school at the age of eighteen, studying kindergarten experimental education. After graduating, she worked as a kindergarten assistant teacher for two years, and then married an elementary school teacher, and soon became a widow. Because her brother was in Nagasaki, starting a family and career, leaving her old mother alone, too lonely, so she asked to return to her mother's home, to accompany her mother, one old and one young, two generations of widows, living together. He Jian was a few months older than her, she called He Jian "Yu Ge", and also called him "Comet Brother", because He Jian did not come often.

This time He Jian came suddenly, and dressed like this, of course, she was very surprised; and because she had experienced a small period of life's vicissitudes in these six years, once she saw this fraternal heterologous flesh and blood, of course, she could not avoid touching some parting sadness. Seeing that He Jian did not speak, she instinctively knew what He Jian needed. Within five minutes, she helped the maid to prepare what He Jian needed - a warm bath, a set of pajamas, a clean sleeping place. Before He Jian entered the bath, she only said softly, "Mom went to the city to buy something, she will be back in two or three hours." Common sense and reason made her do exactly what He Jian wanted.

It was after nine o'clock in the evening when He Jian woke up from his sleep, because he slept peacefully and comfortably, he felt that his spirit had completely recovered. He lay there without moving, the room was not very bright, only on the small table in the corner of the room, there was a low-intensity table lamp, the lamp had a delicate flower shade, and on top of it was covered with a layer of green gauze. This was He Jian's favorite arrangement in the old days. Along with this dim light, he saw several photos on the wall, one of which was taken when he graduated, riding on a tall white horse, wearing full armor. On the clothes rack in another corner of the room, hung his suit, top hat, and on the ground were his leather shoes; at a glance, he knew that the clothes had been cleaned up, and the shoes were also polished clean. This was to prevent He Jian from having anything else to do, and he could put them on as soon as he got up. On a small chair next to him, draped a kimono with a blue background and white dots, a waistband, and a pair of slippers on the ground.

It was extremely quiet! Only the sound of waves came from afar; however, if you did not listen carefully, this subtle, mournful sound of waves would not be heard.

He Jian put on the kimono and stood by the window, gazing at the silent night scene under the faint light reflected by the stars. These were exactly the same as six years ago, without any change: according to the old impression, like rereading a familiar book, he could still see the small tail of the mountain on the side, planted with tall and low black pine trees, and in the places with prominent hills and valleys, there were Japanese-style pavilions, recognizing a corner or half a face from the pine forest. At the foot of the mountain, a beach reflected the starlight, showing a dark silver color, which contrasted with the ink-like sea water in the distance, forming a kind of pale comparison. This kind of pale scenery, harmonized with He Jian's depressed mood, instead felt a kind of pleasant and sympathetic pleasure.

When people are in a state of emotional tension, the best way is to find a quiet place, relax the body and mind as much as possible, so that the tense emotions can naturally relax and gradually restore the balance of mind. However, in a state of emotional tension, at the same time feeling frustrated, disappointed, and even the plans do not go smoothly, the future is bleak, the terror of failure, on a mind, like a dark shadow, sweeps back and forth, causing you to go to despair, even suicide; at this time, the most effective and wonderful elixir is to throw yourself into the arms of your mother, or into the jade arms of your lover, or into the sympathy and understanding of your confidant, and try to tell them as much as possible, or let them use such a big warmth to comfort you. In this way, without much time, you can also restore the balance of body and mind.

### New Anecdotes

— Xi Xi

During the Jin and Song dynasties in China, a kind of folk literature emerged, compiling short essays with fresh and bizarre news and materials, such as Gan Bao's "In Search of the Supernatural" and Liu Jingshu's "Garden of Wonders." From this kind of book, we can see the philosophy of life of our nation, and the traces of historical development and transformation. Moreover, Chinese mythological stories almost all have a characteristic, that is, the reflection of social system and thought, which can also be said to be realistic. Try to look at Hong Mai's "Yi Jian Zhi" and Ji Yun's "Notes from the Cottage of Close Observation," what is the difference from reading a social history of the Song Dynasty and the Qianlong era of the Qing Dynasty?

Western stories, however, are more surreal, and many places are simply unbelievable, but they also contain very deep philosophies that are very thought-provoking.

About ten years ago, there was a woman in Germany who had not received higher education, but could speak a dialect. No one could tell which country it was from. Later, several professors who studied ancient literature studied it carefully and found out that it was the language of the Aramaic people in the Jewish era. Even though the nation is destroyed, the books still exist, so we can still know a thing or two, but no one can speak it. This woman can actually speak it fluently. Except for the Buddhist theory of reincarnation, that a person from the ancient Aramaic people came to be reborn, it is difficult to explain. This was what a deceased Jewish-German doctor, Dr. W61ff, told Nie Yuntai in Shanghai. This kind of thing has certainly happened in the West, but not so incredible. For example, in 1935, the World News Agency's correspondent in Brazil reported: In Sacramento, Brazil, there was a poor child named Almeida, who was only twelve years old. His parents were both ignorant. This child was born with a special talent, able to speak and write a special language that no one knew. He could also translate it into Portuguese without any grammatical errors. In fact, he had never learned Portuguese, which is very similar to this.

Recently, Bennett Cerf, a publisher in the United States who specializes in writing notes, recorded such a real event.

Two female teachers drove from the northeastern United States on a cross-country trip. One day, in the Kansas wilderness, it was late and the car broke down again. These two people did not know how to repair the machine, so what should they do? Fortunately, they found what seemed to be a two-story country house in the distance, so they stumbled to the door and gently knocked on the door. Who knew there was no response? They knew it was an empty house, and the door was not locked. These two people relied on the flashlights in their bags and found that the living room and dining room were still quite orderly, and the equipment was still good, but the entire house was covered with a layer of dust, indicating that it had been uninhabited for a long time. They picked up some firewood and lit the fireplace, found blankets, and lay down on the sofa to wait for dawn, thinking that they had found a great place. Late at night, one of them suddenly felt as if someone had entered the house and was awakened by it. The other one also jumped up at the same time without expecting it. Suddenly, the room was filled with cold, and they smelled a smell of sea water (this place is always thousands of miles away from the sea). Then they saw a young man floating in as if swimming, clearly wearing oilskin clothes and boots, and water droplets were still reflected on his hair. He walked to the fireplace, shivering, and knelt down. One of the women could not help but scream, and the man looked back and disappeared suddenly. Later, as the morning light gradually appeared, the two people were stunned and questioned each other. They clearly saw the same thing, it was definitely not a dream! Moreover, looking closely at the fireplace, there was actually a pile of salt water and a green seaweed. When they found the car repairman, they learned that the owner of this house was named Newton, who had been sailing to the East for almost two years without any news. Later, they also learned that this person was a sailor on the Robert B. Anthony cargo ship on April 14, 1937. Six weeks later, it sank in a storm near Greenland, and all the people on board were killed. As for the seaweed, experts confirmed that it was indeed a marine organism and often grew on corpses.

Cerf is in the United States, very similar to the ancient Chinese Qi Xie Zhi Guai, and his writings are very popular.

### Two Kinds of Literary Criticism

— Yang Tongfang

Some opinions on literary criticism

There are many kinds of modern literary criticism, the important ones are Inductive Criticism and Judicial Criticism. The main points and mutual relationship are briefly described below:

Inductive criticism applies the inductive method in science, and explains the content of the work in detail with an objective attitude, so that the reader can judge its value. All the elements contained in the work, the critic should fully explain them. Inductive criticism can be divided into two types according to its inductive method: one is consistent with the work being criticized, the purpose is to carefully examine the work and sequentially describe its content, and then determine the value of the work. Moulton's "Shakespeare as a Dramatic Artist" is a representative of this kind of criticism. The other is not only to delve into the content of the work, but also to examine the relationship between the work and its surrounding environment, the purpose is to study the value of a certain work compared with other works at the same time, and determine the status of the work. Sainte-Beuve and Taine both take this attitude. The purpose of inductive criticism is mainly to penetrate the center of the work, analyze the meaning of the work and induce it into a formula, so it can also distinguish the qualities of power and beauty contained in the work, as well as what is temporary and what is permanent in the work. Inductive criticism also has a great attempt, which should be specially mentioned here: to explain the various artistic and moral principles that the writer intentionally or unintentionally is guided and dominated by.

Judicial criticism is a kind of criticism that directly gives a value judgment to the writer or the work. Critics judge the value of writers or works with fixed standards, and their attitude is like a judge, very arrogant. Critics evaluate the value of the work based on how well it conforms to the standard. Because judicial criticism focuses on value, it is also called Criticism of Values. Jeffrey, a British critic at the end of the nineteenth century, was known as the representative of this school. Judicial criticism is often limited by two conditions: (1) a judgment must be made after inductive criticism; (2) the critic must regard what is expressed in the judgment as his own feelings and thoughts, not the true appearance of the writer or the work.

Regarding these two kinds of criticism, each has its own claims. Inductive criticism and judicial criticism are exactly on two different sides. The former only needs to explain, unfold, and illuminate the content of the work, and thinks that the value is self-evident and does not need to be judged, while the latter only relies on the critic's own likes and dislikes to make a subjective judgment. Among the two, inductive criticism is naturally more objective. Sainte-Beuve said: "For those who have fully studied what I have written, they must regard me as an appropriate critic, and a critic who does not flatter any code." Therefore, when he criticizes a certain work, he must first study all the author's works, study his character, family, and all living environment. After careful research, he explains the characteristics of the work and the author. Sainte-Beuve is only the founder of scientific criticism, and Taine, the builder of scientific criticism, has a more precise method than Sainte-Beuve. Taine's criticism; starts from the three elements that constitute art—race, environment, and era—he believes that every artistic work is not isolated, it must be affected by his race and environment, social influence, and the spirit of the times. When criticizing any work and author, we must use these influences to explain the characteristics of the work and the author. This attitude is really very correct.

The method of inductive criticism is of course more objective and in line with scientific principles, but I think that literary criticism cannot only focus on one side of explanation or judgment. Because the function of literary criticism must include both criticism and judgment. In my opinion, correct literary criticism should be a comprehensive and concrete unification of explanation and judgment. However, because the procedure of explanation comes before judgment, explanation is more important than judgment. If the content is not recognized in detail first, the value cannot be judged. Therefore, inductive criticism is the foundation of all criticism. However, using only inductive criticism is not enough to exhaust the functions of literary criticism. Since literary works have their advantages and disadvantages, it is natural to judge the value of their merits. After we have deeply understood the content of a certain work or writer, we should proceed to evaluate its value, or re-evaluate the works that have been previously determined by the predecessors. In this case, we still have to use judicial criticism.

How do I explain the comprehensive and concrete unity of induction and judgment that I said? Ideal literary criticism, of course, cannot lack explanation, but it is not enough to just interpret the external form. The main thing is to use the method of analysis to make a concrete analysis of the work, and to lay out the content nakedly and frankly, which is not a good explanation. A good explanation should be analytical. A good literary work must have a three-dimensional and intricate content, and literary criticism is certainly not satisfied with a superficial explanation. If you don't use the method of analysis, how can you explain the complex and intricate work? As for judgment, it is indispensable for literary criticism, but it should also avoid personal prejudices as much as possible. You must completely abandon your own likes and dislikes, and not allow the slightest arbitrariness. In everything, take a purely objective attitude, do not have a self-righteous mentality, and base the relative judgment of the value of the work on the analysis of the content and the true components of the work's response to the objective society. In this way, you will naturally not be blinded by prejudice and personal emotional thoughts about the true value of the work.

The field of literary criticism in our country is very underdeveloped, even more backward than creation. Even if you occasionally see literary reviews and book reviews, they are at most limited to explanation, and accurate judgments are rarely seen. As for saying that this is an objective tendency, in order to avoid arbitrariness and prejudice, no judgment is made. It is better to say that this is due to the barrenness of literary criticism in our country. Critics have not yet trained a sharp eye and cultivated a superb appreciation ability, so correct judicial criticism has not been universally established. We do not need the harsh attitude of a judge announcing a verdict today, but we urgently need an objective and relative judgment of the value of the work.

### Sports Field

— Shao Fu

The Jiangwan arsenal explosion destroyed half of this Far East's number one sports field. Thinking about the difficulty of reconstruction at present, winter goes and spring comes, where will the large-scale sports meeting be held next year and in the future? I am really saddened.

It was built with an investment of 1.5 million yuan in 1934. Today, in terms of 10,000 times, it would require 15 billion. What's more, the municipal government has thousands of things to be taken care of, and the people's livelihood is so dilapidated. Where does the manpower and financial resources come from?

The fate of the sports field is tragic enough. After its completion in the spring of 1935, it only held the Sixth National Games once on National Day of that year, displaying its power. Since then, it has not been used as a larger venue. In the past nine years, it has suffered from war and frost, which is very bleak. After the victory, it was not reorganized, but instead, military supplies were piled up haphazardly and used as warehouses, which is really like using Longjing tea as feed, wasting things! Now, it is simply an explosion, so that what was spared from the eight-year fall of the Battle of Shanghai has been destroyed in one fell swoop. What misfortune does the sports field can anticipate.

Now that things have come to this, how can we make up for it?

First, the municipal education authorities should quickly take it back:

Second, raise funds for repairs. (Whether this repair fee comes from compensation or from donations is decided by the organizers through consultation.)

This not only concerns the welfare of all Shanghai citizens! At this time, the Municipal Council should urge the municipal government to take active action without delay!

### Distribution and Relief: Like This, Like That

— Wu Shuyu

Melton and Wool Blanket

Returning to my home, when I dragged my family through Changsha, Hunan from Chongqing, the Hunan branch of the Executive Yuan was distributing American food products; milk powder, canned meat, biscuits, etc., were rolling out of the warehouse of the distribution station, onto the road in front of the distribution station, and into the stalls and baskets of hawkers all over Changsha. At first, I thought that these things that foreigners eat were brought here to make a fortune, and they must not be very good; later, after trying them out with my friends, I realized that these distributed goods were not only cheap, but also of good quality. For example: 14-pound American bacon sells for only 12,000 yuan, and it tastes so good that our famous Hunan bacon has to give way; a 1 1/2 pound box of soda crackers or a 1 3/4 pound box of sweet crackers sells for only 1,000 yuan, which is so many times better than Jiu Ru Qi's soda crackers that sell for 5,000 yuan per catty; a 5-pound can of Golden Mountain milk powder costs 13,000 yuan, which is almost the same as the locally produced lotus root powder; in addition, there is also "ten-person provisions", which costs only 12,500 yuan, which includes cigarettes, candies, biscuits, and canned goods.

Seeing these good things with my eyes, and tasting these good things with my mouth, my wife said to me: "Let's buy some too"? I listened to her words with my ears, and the thought of these things made my mouth water, so I unhesitatingly agreed to her suggestion: "Okay! Let's buy them"! We bought: three 14-pound cans of American bacon, eight 1 1/2 pound boxes of soda crackers, four 1 3/4 pound boxes of sweet crackers, and two 5-pound cans of Golden Mountain milk powder. In addition, we also planned to buy "ten-person provisions", but because the goods were good and the price was low, it was difficult to buy. After entrusting them again and again, I found a friend who worked in the Hunan branch of the Executive Yuan. This friend initially said that it was "difficult to buy", but when I pressed him, he came up with an excuse: "Speaker Zhao of the Provincial Council entrusted our Director Yu to buy two copies of 'ten-person provisions' for him, and he hasn't been able to buy them yet"!

Thinking about what my friend said, although it was a bit exaggerated; but Hunan people have Hunan characteristics, maybe they won't take advantage of others like Shanghai people? Moreover, although I wanted the cigarettes, candies, and biscuits in the "ten-person provisions"; but, for a person who is used to eating chili peppers, when there is no proper way to settle the small amount of sweet meat cans, I had to temporarily give up.

When I arrived in Shanghai, the distribution offices here were distributing American all-wool army blankets and Melton wool fabrics. Thinking of the distributed goods in Changsha, I hurriedly registered and borrowed money to pay the fees; after paying the fees, within a few days, I saw a notice from the distribution office in the newspaper, saying that preferential treatment would be given to public teachers and employees, and the distribution price of Melton wool fabrics would be reduced from 30,700 yuan per yard to 25,500 yuan. Good! The market price of Melton wool fabrics has already fallen to 28,000 yuan, shouldn't the distribution goods for public teachers and employees be reduced a little? However, although that's the case, the gentlemen at the distribution office can adjust the price at any time according to the market decline. This quick and refreshing style should be set up a memorial tablet for them in the hearts of every public teacher and employee who benefits from it.

Later, I was not able to get these items that I had registered and paid for, because of personal matters I ran to Nanjing; when I came back from Nanjing again, the colleagues in the office told me: "The Melton wool fabrics have been received, but there is no news about the army blankets." I felt relieved and said, "It doesn't matter." But when they handed the fabrics to me, I looked closely: "Ah! How is this Melton wool fabrics"? At this time, I didn't dare to suspect that our office colleagues were engaging in corruption, but I still smiled and said what I thought in my heart.

"This is the kind of goods that the distribution office sent down." The office colleague replied.

"The Melton wool fabrics that are being sold in the market are not like this"! I said.

"The ones sold in the market are American goods, these are woven by Chinese themselves."

At this time, I was silent. On the one hand, I was regretting that I didn't ask the price clearly before registering and paying for the distributed goods when I returned to Shanghai this time; on the other hand, I was complaining to the gentlemen at the distribution office, since they are doing business as agents for manufacturers, why didn't they stipulate one more item in the distribution method, like selling rat poison: "If it is fake, we will replace it, and if it doesn't work, we will return the money"? However, when it comes to "returning the money", it is best to calculate the interest rate according to the reality of rising prices and the daily depreciation of the currency; otherwise, all these methods, in black and white, although they say that they are giving preferential treatment to public teachers and employees, in reality they are making the public teachers and employees not know whether to laugh or cry.

In the end, I will take this opportunity to talk about the survival of the distribution system, and the expenses of staff and workers. Since it is an extra expenditure of public funds, then I hope that it can truly be beneficial and truly give preferential treatment to public teachers and employees, and not just waste public funds as agents for manufacturers... Of course, the gentlemen in charge may think that now American goods are attacking, and domestic manufacturers can't resist, so by doing this, they can get the reputation of giving preferential treatment to public teachers and employees, and also rescue manufacturers, and themselves... It's really killing three birds with one stone. And as time goes on, the manufacturers will be rescued, and naturally there will be people who support them; the trade deficit will be reduced, and they should be promoted for their achievements. However, what I am worried about is that "the future is long", and who can guarantee that the "bright future" that they have set their sights on will not "dream more at night"? The proper way is to be realistic, then I can only ask the gentlemen at the distribution office to go to some domestic goods companies or domestic goods exhibition halls and sit and chat, which is more practical.

So, this is what Melton wool fabrics are like. Army wool blankets have already flown to the hands of Jewish merchants on the border. It is ridiculous and hateful, and we must speak out; whether it is "wool fabrics" or "blankets", we must investigate this kind of scam!

(Note: In the previous article "Official Distribution of Melton Wool Fabrics" published in this journal, it was assumed that this so-called Melton was genuine American Melton, so it was pointed out that the government should distribute more domestic goods. Now we have learned that the "Melton" distributed by the government is only a fake American product, which can be said to be well-intentioned and admirable!)

### Inside Story of Seeking a Spouse

— Qiao Sheng

One day, in the classifieds of a certain newspaper, an advertisement for seeking a spouse appeared: "Miss ×, aged 20, possesses both beauty and virtue, and has a gentle temperament. She now wishes to find a boyfriend, aged between 23 and 26, with a university education and a clean family background. Those who meet the requirements can send letters to ×× P.O. Box 235, and those who are a good match will be interviewed."

The next day, a great many applications were received. The applicants all described how beautiful they were, how profound their knowledge was, and how wealthy their families were...

A few days later, the applicants all received a letter, the gist of which was: Not knowing the level of the other party's education, please write a love letter.

Thus, the applicants put their minds to work, wholeheartedly writing a perfect love letter, hoping to win an interview with the "beautiful and virtuous, gentle-tempered" beauty. Some even went through back channels, seeking ghostwriters, and at the same time, respectfully addressed the envelope and solemnly dropped it into the mailbox. Thus, they waited for the arrival of good news; however, strangely enough, this love letter seemed to be a stone thrown into the sea, without any response.

Several months later, an advertisement for ×× Bookstore appeared in the newspaper, revealing that Dr. ××'s great new contribution—the Complete Collection of Love Letters—had been published!

Unexpectedly, the "love letter masterpieces" of those applicants from several months ago were all typeset and printed in it! Unfortunately, the author was not you, but Dr. ××!

The world-renowned pianist Kreisler has sold his precious violin to a friend. The price has not been announced.

Shanghai Cross-section

### The Organization of Beggars 12

— Huang

Genuine and Fake Refugees

"Liao Di Gang" is one of the street scams run by veteran beggar gangs. It is a kind of group begging performance. But since its purpose is only to seek voluntary donations, although it is a trap, it is not an illegal activity. The organizational method of the group is to select six or seven men, women, old and young from the beggar gang, resembling a family, complete with parents, children, and daughters-in-law. It would be ideal if an old woman with white hair and wrinkled skin could be found. The method of composition is like a theater troupe selecting actors, and it does require some effort. China has suffered from frequent wars and constant famines for years. In addition, the Japanese invaders have been harassing the country for many years, and the number of refugees fleeing to Shanghai from the interior is increasing daily. The influx of genuine refugees has provided an opportunity for the sharp-eyed and quick-handed veteran beggar gangs to organize fake refugees from the original beggars, in order to absorb donations from the public. Those engaged in "Liao Di" must wear broken but not tattered clothes, so as not to be seen as beggars in disguise by discerning people. When passersby stop to watch, the crowd grows larger and larger. Then everyone puts on a mournful face, and one of them, a good speaker, tells the audience about the disasters in their hometown or the tragic circumstances of their plight in a touching voice, in the guise of a spokesperson. They say that they have left their hometown and come to Shanghai, but unfortunately, they have not met their relatives, their funds have been exhausted, and the whole family has not had food for several days, begging the audience for donations. Passersby then throw money, and those who do not donate can only leave. And because there are many passersby, the income is also considerable. When the accounts are settled at dusk, after deducting 10% for the local gangster beggar boss, the remaining amount is distributed in different proportions, not equally according to the number of people. For example, the main actor gets a higher reward, and the elderly are valued for their rarity, so they cannot be treated shabbily. The remaining supporting actors, known as "mahjong tiles" by insiders, are common talents who are easily found, and they are not afraid of quitting if they are given less. The most valuable is the old woman playing the white-haired grandmother, because this kind of talent is the most scarce in the beggar gang, and young people cannot be disguised as old. They must be genuine old people. A group with such an old person can get the most money. This is a secret of the trade that deeply understands the psychology of the audience. Who doesn't have parents, especially a white-haired old woman? Extending this to others, it is inevitable that they will feel compassion. However, this kind of group is also constantly changing. A certain beggar may be in Group A this week, and next week he may be mixed into Group B. Although their situation is pitiful, it is a deceptive tactic, and the fake is mixed with the genuine, which in turn prevents genuine refugees from receiving donations. This is really hateful!

This kind of "occupying land" beggar gang originated very early, and passersby are used to seeing it, so they gradually see through the inside story, and donations are less. Moreover, it is difficult to spread it by word of mouth, and sometimes it is not as convenient as written propaganda, so the tricks are renewed, and the "white-headed business" has emerged. This is what Shanghai people call "complaining on the ground." This gang must have someone who can read and write a little, and use a piece of chalk to beg on the street. They write mournful words all over the ground, eloquently expressing their feelings. This is what it means to sweep away civilization! But sometimes the beggar is uneducated, so he has to ask "passersby" to write a draft, formulate the words, and then the beggar who knows a little "classical Chinese" memorizes it and writes it on the ground in the same way. A more straightforward method is to ask a down-and-out scholar to write the words early in the morning when there are few pedestrians, and then have the beggar stand guard, pretending to be his own masterpiece. The scholar has already received his fee and retreated. Who would have thought that beggars could afford a secretary? Pedestrians come and go, and no one goes to the bottom of it, only thinking that the scholar is in a desperate situation, and they all generously donate. At first, this kind of begging was quite profitable, but over time, the flaws gradually became apparent. And it can be seen everywhere, and it is difficult to absorb money anymore!

### Prediction

— Jiang Liu

In order to increase the national treasury revenue, the Ministry of Finance is now planning to levy a "special wealth tax." One of the targets of the tax is: those who win the first prize in the lottery will be taxed uniformly. And it is said that the execution is extremely strict, and if the report is false, all of their property will be confiscated. It is expected that a new pattern of "secret lottery" will appear in Shanghai soon, and the advertisements will definitely promote: guaranteeing that customers will not "lose the chicken and the rice"!

### "Corrupt Officials" Laugh

— Hua Shi

It is said that because of the depression in Shanghai, the funds of wealthy merchants and officials here have been fleeing to Hong Kong for the past month, totaling more than 30 billion yuan. Hong Kong's industry and commerce are booming. Even though the British brutally killed Zhang Tianxiang in Shenzhen, the Chinese are still rushing to it, fearing to be left behind. Who says that merchants are hateful? They are indeed shouldering the great ambition of opening up friendly relations and turning hostility into peace!

### Suggestion

— Que Chou

The surplus materials stored in Nanyang are coming in large quantities again. I suggest to the Shanghai Municipal Authorities: open up temporary markets as much as possible to accommodate vendors, otherwise, the price of glass in Shanghai will rise like a rocket again.

### Public Opinion

— Zhong Yi

If I were also a National Assembly representative, then I would definitely advocate making Jiangdu, Jiangsu, the capital, because that is my hometown.

Common Sense Test

### Let's Talk About Customs Gold Units

— Ding Yi Chang

There are probably no countries with more styles of banknotes than China! Even if we are not people from banks and money shops, we always have many various banknotes coming and going in our hands every day for the sake of life. If that is a straight-edged, brand-new banknote, when you are free, take a magnifying glass or your sharp eyesight to explore it, and you will find many patterns and unspeakable "secrets." I think the interest is no less than that of "a certain stamp."

Here, let's first take the "Customs Gold Units" note as an example, and write down ten questions, hoping that the readers of "Free Talk" will all try it. It includes some general knowledge and printing knowledge. This time, it is difficult for us to set a standard saying how many questions must be answered at least. However, guessing the answers separately with friends and family and comparing them with each other is still the best way to measure.

The questions are entered into the topic, please rely solely on memory to think and answer, without taking out a few Customs Gold Units notes to "search for the steed from the picture."

(1) When you carefully count whether there are enough 100 sheets in a stack of brand-new, straight-edged "Customs Gold Units" notes that are exchanged from the Central Bank in unopened bundles, a pleasant fragrance rushes into your nose. Who says it is the smell of "copper"? But I want to ask where this fragrance comes from. Do you think it is because:

A. The banknotes were shipped from the United States to China and happened to be placed in the same cabin as oranges and bananas?

B. It was just a deposit that a certain lady took out of her handbag, so "there is still a lingering fragrance"?

C. Or, is it the smell of a special solvent in the printing ink?

(2) There are often sparse small red, yellow, and blue dots on the front and back of the "Customs Gold Units" note. Do you think this is:

A. Printed on the paper to increase the beauty?

B. A unique secret sign of the "Customs Gold Units" note?

C. Or, when manufacturing banknote paper, small circular colored paper pieces are mixed into the paper to prevent counterfeiting?

(3) In addition to the text, do you think the pattern of each "Customs Gold Units" note, whether on the front or back, is:

A. Completely the same on the left and right halves?

B. Completely different on the left and right halves?

C. Or, generally the same, but there are great differences in the details?

(4) Regarding the "Customs Gold Units" notes with different denominations, according to your memory, do you think the size of the note surface is:

A. Completely the same?

B. The larger the amount, the larger the area?

C. Or, except for the three largest amounts being the same, the larger the denomination of the smaller amounts, the larger the area of the note?

(5) Do you believe that there are several English letters hidden within the oval frame of Sun Yat-sen's portrait on the front of the "Customs Gold Units" note? Can you explain its meaning?

(6) Whether it is next to Sun Yat-sen's portrait on the front or in the graphic of the Central Bank photo on the back, there is an English letter "C" hidden in a circle of less than half a millimeter. Do you think the meaning of this C is:

A. An abbreviation for "Copyright Reserved, Reproduction Prohibited"?

B. An abbreviation for "American Bank Note Company"?

C. Or, the signature of the draftsman?

(7) The serial number of the "Customs Gold Units" note is a six-digit number, with two English letters added before it. Taking the "Customs Gold Units" note with a denomination of 50 yuan, which is equivalent to 1,000 yuan in legal tender, as an example, if the first one is "AA000000" and the last one is ZZ999999, without any breaks in between, what is the total value in national currency? Can you choose a suitable number from the following three numbers within two minutes?

A. 676,000,000,000 yuan.

B. 756,000,000 yuan.

C. 70 billion yuan.

After answering the above eight questions, for the remaining two questions below, please take out a Customs Gold Units note and "savor" it before answering:

(8) To sum up various printing techniques, there are only three types: "relief printing," "planographic printing," and "intaglio printing." However, it is quite difficult for the various printed materials we usually see to have all three. Only "Customs Gold Units" notes and certain securities have relief, planographic, and intaglio printing. Please indicate which printing technique each of the following three parts of the Customs Gold Units note belongs to by filling in "relief," "planographic," or "intaglio" appropriately in the parentheses!

A. The part with the same color on the front and back and occupying the largest area ( )

B. The part with the most colors and the greatest changes in the middle and lower part of Sun Yat-sen's portrait on the front ( )

C. The red serial number and the two red square seals ( )

(9) Careful people may have already noticed that in the "Customs Gold Units" notes with different denominations, the blank spaces on the paper always have some very faint colors. For example, 100 yuan and 200 yuan have a bit of light gray, 400 yuan has a bit of light green, and "purple Customs Gold Units" and "red Customs Gold Units" also have some light purple or light red, respectively. What do you think the reason is:

A. The color of the banknote paper used is different?

B. The original plate was stained during planographic printing?

C. Or, the residue of the printing ink during intaglio printing?
