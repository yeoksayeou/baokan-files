### Marshall's Fifth Trip to Lushan: Before Leaving Nanjing, He Met with Yu Dawei and Zhou Enlai Separately, Exploring New Avenues for Peace Talks

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] Special Envoy Marshall received Yu Dawei at 9:00 AM on the 23rd, and then received Zhou Enlai at 11:00 AM. He left Nanjing for Lushan at 2:00 PM.

[Our Guling Dispatch, 23rd] Special Envoy Marshall arrived at Lushan for the fifth time at 6:30 PM on the 23rd. Mrs. Marshall greeted him at Xiaotianchi. It is reported that Marshall is scheduled to pay a visit to Chairman Chiang on the 24th.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] Ambassador Stuart spent the 23rd with limited external contact. Shao Lizi visited him at 11:00 AM for about an hour, conveying the People's Political Council's stance on peace from the morning session. In the afternoon, besides meeting with Canadian Ambassador Odlum, Stuart also summoned his staff.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] US Embassy personnel informed reporters on the 23rd that Marshall and Stuart's mediation efforts are still focused on understanding the differences between the Communist and Nationalist sides. After repeated meetings, the positions of the two sides remain the same as before June 29th. Although both sides have expressed their willingness to resolve the issue politically, neither has made any new concessions. The Political Consultative Conference resolutions, military reorganization plan, and restoration of transportation are the main topics of discussion. The differences on transportation are relatively small, but the main sticking points between the Communists and Nationalists remain the location of Communist troops and local administrative power. The government believes that it has already made five points on the troop location issue and has no reason to concede further. The Communist Party continues to disagree. Therefore, Marshall and Stuart are seeking new avenues for mediation. They do not intend to propose any new plan until the crux of the problem is thoroughly understood. Marshall has flown to Guling to convey the Communist Party's views and seek Chairman Chiang's opinion. He is expected to return in the next few days.

[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 23rd] Before leaving Nanjing, Special Envoy Marshall held two important meetings. The first was with Minister of Communications Yu Dawei at 9:30 AM, which lasted until 10:30 AM, discussing the restoration of transportation according to the agreements signed by both the Nationalist and Communist sides. The second meeting was with Communist representative Zhou Enlai at 11:00 AM, which lasted until 12:30 PM. According to Communist sources, the discussion involved the "current situation." These sources said that this was Marshall's fifth trip to Guling, and it may be his last, but this does not mean that negotiations have broken down.

### Canadian Ambassador Odlum Speaks: The Visit to the Chairman Was Merely a Social Call, Denying Marshall's Request for Him to Participate in Negotiations

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] When Canadian Ambassador to China, Major General Odlum, met with our reporter at the embassy on the 23rd, he firmly denied the foreign news agency report that Marshall had asked him to explain to Chairman Chiang in order to break the current stalemate in negotiations. In the straightforward manner of a military diplomat, he said: "I have visited Chairman Chiang several times in Guling, and I have also met with Marshall after returning to Nanjing. However, these were merely social calls, too ordinary to be considered significant, just like my current conversation with you (the reporter). It should not be inferred that I will participate in peace negotiations." His tone suggested dissatisfaction with the matter. When the reporter visited the US Embassy at 5:00 PM, Ambassador Odlum was seen arriving by car at 5:45 PM. When the reporter left at 6:30 PM, he had not yet departed, presumably still engaged in his "social" conversation with Ambassador Stuart.

### The Standing Committee of the People's Political Council Held a Discussion Yesterday

A Declaration Calling for Peace Will Be Issued

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] The Standing Committee of the People's Political Council held an ad hoc meeting at 9:00 AM on the 23rd. Due to the lack of a quorum, it was changed to a discussion. The main topic was the proposal by seven councilors, including Fan Yuzui, Yin Shuxian, Wu Zhaoxu, and Wu Chunwu, calling for peace and the resumption of negotiations to achieve peaceful unification. Wu Zhaoxu and others explained that they hoped military conflicts could cease immediately. Regarding military reorganization and unification, they hoped the Communist forces would comply with the military reorganization plan. Regarding the expansion of the government structure and convening of the National Assembly, they hoped the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference would be followed. If there were difficulties, they hoped the opinions of third parties such as Marshall and Stuart would be respected, and they proposed persuading Mao Zedong to stop mobilization. Because some councilors also wanted to speak, it was decided to hold another meeting in the afternoon of the 24th to draft a declaration, and to hold a meeting on the 30th to approve and publish it. The meeting also discussed the government's recent adjustment of exchange rates. The councilors hoped the government could find ways to prevent prices from rising in response to the exchange rate adjustment. The meeting lasted for two hours and forty-five minutes.

Shao Lizi Agrees to the Early Convening of a Constitutional Draft Committee

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] When a reporter visited Minister Shao Lizi on the 23rd to inquire about the opinion of Mr. Zhang from Guling to convene a Constitutional Draft Review Committee, Shao said: "In my personal opinion, the Constitutional Draft Review Committee should also be convened as soon as possible." When the reporter asked whether the rumor that the People's Political Council would meet on Double Ten Day was true, Shao said: "Someone has made this suggestion, and it may be possible." Regarding the Lushan talks, Shao believed that if they did take place, they could not be called "talks" because they would have no formal structure and would not lead to any resolutions.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] Councilor Wu Chunwu told reporters that it was necessary for the People's Political Council to hold another meeting before the National Assembly was convened, but it was not yet decided whether it would be held on Double Ten Day.

### Minister Peng Corrects Foreign Reporters' Records

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] A reporter recently visited Minister Peng Xuepei, who stated that the content of his conversation recorded by the United Press reporter at the foreign reporters' reception on the 21st did not fully match his original intention at the time. The following are the more important points that need to be corrected: The reporter asked, what is the significance of the Communist Party's mobilization order? I replied, there are not many regular troops in the Communist Party, but more so-called "local Communists." What is called mobilization is simply driving more farmers to join the local Communist forces. The foreign reporter asked, does the government attach importance to the Communist Party's mobilization order? I replied, it cannot be ignored either. Asked, is the mobilization order tantamount to a declaration of war? I replied that the term declaration of war is not applicable, and I meant that a party cannot declare war on the government. Asked, when will the government be reorganized to expand its base? I replied that the Executive Yuan already has non-Kuomintang members as Ministers of Agriculture and Forestry, Economy, and Transportation, and this expansion can continue at any time. Asked, is the government not reorganizing immediately because the conditions proposed by Chairman Chiang have not been accepted by the Communist Party? I replied that the so-called conditions are mostly the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference or the agreements signed by both parties, and only urge implementation. However, because the Communist Party has expanded its territory in the Northeast, Shandong, and northern Jiangsu, the situation has changed, so the content of the conditions must also adapt to this situation. As for the main dispute, the United Press reporter's conjecture that the main conflict lies in whether northern Jiangsu counties should be governed by the Communist Party or the government is entirely their own. Asked, does the government support a referendum in northern Jiangsu under international supervision? I replied that I had not heard of such a peculiar suggestion, but there would be no freedom of voting under Communist rule. Asked, is the Political Consultative Conference dead? I replied that there is no question of life or death, and I meant that the terms of life and death are not very accurate. This issue is quite complex and cannot be summarized by the words life and death. In short, the Communist Party has recently put forward terms such as national mobilization and launching an offensive, loudly proclaiming that it is treating the government as an enemy, driving hundreds of thousands of illiterate people with no military training to blindly run onto the battlefield, and the object of its so-called offensive is the national army that has fought for eight years to defend the country and protect the people. How can we not feel pain and regret when we witness this scene? The government has a responsibility to defend the land and protect the people and cannot hand over the power of local and central governments to the Communist Party, which is a minority. This is definitely not the will of the Chinese people. I sincerely hope that the Communist Party will quickly follow Chairman Chiang's declaration on August 14, withdraw from areas that constitute a threat to peace and obstruct transportation, and withdraw its so-called mobilization offensive, so as to avoid涂炭 to the people. The government is like a parent to the people. Although it sometimes rebukes a few or snatches the knives and guns in their hands, the purpose is still to maintain the well-being of the whole family. Peaceful unification is always what the government desires.

### Closing Ceremony of the Lushan Summer Camp: Chairman Chiang Delivers a Personal Address, Encouraging Students to Take on the Mission of Revolution and Become the Most Loyal Disciples of the Founding Father

[Central News Agency, Guling, 23rd] The Lushan Summer Camp held its closing ceremony at the auditorium of the Chuanxi Study Hall at 10:00 AM on the 23rd. Chairman Chiang, in his capacity as concurrent head of the团, personally presided over the ceremony. After leading the attendees in performing rituals, he delivered an impromptu address encouraging the students to focus on two things: practicing what they learn and studying academic methods. The address lasted for forty minutes. After the ceremony, he returned to the 行辕 to rest. At noon, he returned to the camp to have lunch with all the officials. When the chairman entered and exited the dining hall, cheers echoed throughout the valley. Dai Chuanxian, Zhou Zhongjun, He Haoruo, and Liu Keshu were invited to the camp as guests or lecturers to observe the ceremony on the 23rd. All the students in the camp who were not elected as delegates to the Second Plenary Session of the Youth League left Lushan on the 23rd.

[Another Dispatch] Chairman Chiang gave an address at the closing ceremony of the Lushan Summer Camp at 10:00 AM on the morning of the 23rd. He first said that all the students in the summer camp should encourage each other to become the most loyal disciples of the Founding Father and take on the mission of completing the national revolution. Our revolutionary history is so long, and the Three Principles of the People are so great. Why is it that our principles have not yet been realized, the revolution has not yet succeeded, and the Founding Father's wishes to save and build the country have not yet been fulfilled? The only reason is that our successors cannot practice what they learn. Although the War of Resistance has now been won, the work of construction cannot yet be actively carried out. The country is in difficulty, society is in decline, and the suffering of our compatriots has not yet been alleviated. These are all our common shames, which we should deeply remember and take as our own responsibility. In the future, the success or failure of the revolution and nation-building will depend entirely on our spirit of practice. If everyone can recognize their responsibilities, be pragmatic in every task, and faithfully adhere to the oaths they have sworn and the principles they believe in, and can unswervingly practice and implement them, then the success of the revolution is without doubt. The Chairman then pointed out that in order to improve the efficiency of practice, everyone must cultivate a scientific spirit and learn the scientific order of doing things. The so-called scientific spirit is to be pragmatic and strive for excellence. The scientific order of doing things is to distinguish between importance and urgency, and to proceed from the fundamental to the superficial, and to adapt to the circumstances, grasp the key points, and make practical efforts. The basic work lies in careful analysis and research. If any problem can be thoroughly researched and discussed, then the essence of it can be discovered and a satisfactory solution can be obtained. Revolutionary party members must serve society and be loyal to the country, and they must use scientific principles to judge things and solve problems, so as to simplify complex matters and achieve twice the result with half the effort. The training given to you in the summer camp is not only to temper your body and mind and cultivate good living habits, but most importantly, to practice the principles, especially to have a practical understanding of work methods, and to unite to shoulder this sacred mission of saving and building the country. At 12:00, the chairman participated in the lunch with all the teachers and students and stood up to give an address amidst enthusiastic applause. He briefly said: "Revolutionary party members must have the compassion to care for all living things and serve the society and the people with the heart of one who is hungry and drowning. If there is one person in society who has no food to eat, no clothes to wear, or one person of any age or gender who is not in their proper place, then it is our revolutionary party's responsibility that has not been fulfilled and the efforts of the party members are not enough. They should be pointed out and criticized by others. Therefore, we revolutionary party members have no so-called rights, but only know that there are obligations, no so-called enjoyment, but only know that there is sacrifice. We must work hard and serve the people to relieve their suffering and improve their welfare, so that we will be worthy of being disciples of the Founding Father."

### Finance Minister Yu Arrives in Guling from the Capital; Reports on Financial Measures to the Chairman

[Our Guling Dispatch, 23rd] Finance Minister Yu Hongjun and Chief Secretary of General Affairs Sang Xiqing arrived in Guling at 4:00 PM on the 23rd and checked into the Xianyan Hotel. At 4:30 PM, Mr. Yu met with the Chairman and reported in detail on the Ministry of Finance's recent handling of financial and monetary affairs, which lasted for approximately one hour.

Q: After the foreign exchange adjustment, gold prices fluctuated in various places for a time. Now that the government has taken appropriate measures, gold prices have fallen. But I wonder what good strategy the government has to prevent gold prices from rising again?

A: The government has achieved practical results in suppressing gold prices. Because the foreign exchange reserves and gold holdings controlled by the government, as well as food supplies, are sufficient to control gold prices and stabilize grain prices. In addition, the autumn harvest of grain has been very good recently. In principle, gold prices, grain prices, and general daily necessities unrelated to foreign exchange should not skyrocket.

Q: In the Communist-occupied areas, the local people are suffering deeply because the Communist Party issues banknotes and the currency system is inconsistent. I wonder how the government will properly handle the banknotes issued by the Communist Party in Rugao and other newly recovered areas in northern Jiangsu?

A: The government is properly studying this matter.

### Traitor Chu Minyi Executed by Firing Squad in Suzhou; In His Dying Words, He Hopes the Government Will Educate His Children; He Wishes His Body to Be Sent to Boji Hospital for Autopsy

[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 23rd] The Foreign Minister of the puppet government, Ambassador to Japan, and Governor of Guangdong Province, traitor Chu Minyi, was executed by firing squad at the Shizikou No. 3 Prison in Suzhou on the morning of the 23rd. This generation of treacherous evildoer, although his family repeatedly requested a retrial, ultimately failed to escape death and was brought to justice under strict law. He was sixty-four years old. Our Suzhou-based reporter received advance notice and rushed to the execution ground at dawn to observe from a distance. The details are as follows:

The Supervising Execution Officer Was Temporarily Reassigned

At around 6:00 AM, more than thirty reporters from newspapers in Nanjing, Shanghai, Suzhou, and Wuxi gathered at the No. 3 Prison. At 7:45 AM, the Suzhou High Procuratorate temporarily reassigned Prosecutor Liang Yiqing as the supervising execution officer, accompanied by Clerk Wang Xue____, leading six bailiffs, arrived by car, and were greeted by Warden Chen Songnian and led inside to rest briefly. At 8:00 AM, a temporary courtroom was set up in the prison's instruction hall. Prosecutor Liang, together with Warden Chen and Clerk Wang, took their seats and ordered the bailiffs to bring traitor Chu from Cell No. 2 in the Li-Zi ward. At that time, traitor Chu had just finished washing _____ and was sitting silently_____ on the bed. Seeing the situation, he knew that his final day had arrived and asked the bailiffs to go to the women's ward and inform traitor Chen _____ Jun. Traitor Chen turned pale upon hearing the news and hurriedly instructed the bailiffs to wait a moment. He then wrote a note to Prosecutor Liang, which read: "Yesterday I received the court's ruling rejecting the appeal, and this morning the appeal has been sent out." The intention was to stop the execution. Prosecutor Liang then contacted Chief Han by phone for instructions, and was instructed: "Do not stop the execution." He immediately ordered the prisoner to be brought back. Traitor Chu then knew that it was impossible to reverse the situation, so he changed into new clothes, including a dark gray woolen long gown, a white thin blue striped poplin short shirt and trousers, black silk socks, and black satin shoes. In his left hand he held a string of Buddhist beads. At the gate of the women's ward, he shook hands with Chen _____ Jun and said, "Goodbye." Traitor Chen covered her face with a handkerchief and sobbed without saying a word.

Forced a Smile While Posing for Photos Before the Execution

Traitor Chu was then escorted by the bailiffs to the temporary courtroom. As he passed through the side alley, photographers from various newspapers took pictures. Traitor Chu forced a smile, stood still, and said: "This is the last time, take good pictures." At 8:15 AM, traitor Chu stepped into the temporary courtroom. Although he tried to remain calm, his face was pale, accentuated by his bald head and long beard, making him look quite frightening. He did not salute the court, but stood proudly in front of the docket. It was evident that traitor Chu was filled with regret and hatred, which was endless. Prosecutor Liang first asked his age and origin. Traitor Chu answered loudly, _____ unusual, and the sound of his heart beating erratically could be clearly heard. When asked if he had a will, he initially replied, "No dying words," then continued.

Claimed to Be Ill and Volunteered for Dissection

"I am extremely calm about both life and death. I have nothing to be ashamed of in life, and death must have value. I hope my body can be sent to Boji Hospital in Tianci Village for dissection, because although I look very strong on the outside, I actually have internal illnesses. I am willing to provide it for medical researchers to study, so that they can make a specimen, as my contribution after death." He further said: "I studied at Boji Hospital for a year when I was seventeen, so I have a great connection, and they should accept my body without refusal." His words were quite incoherent. Prosecutor Liang continued to ask about the address of his family, and he replied: "Although someone should be coming to meet me, I don't know where they are currently living. I originally had a residence in Nanjing, but it has long since been moved." When asked again, "Do you have any dying words?" Traitor Chu pondered for a moment and then replied: "I have no will for my family, but I have one son-in-law, two daughters, and three sons. I hope the government can educate my children for me. As for the section on confiscating property, the fact is that my property is extremely pitiful. Since the government has regulations to provide living expenses for the families, I hope that it can be left a little more generously, so as to prevent my wife from having to work for food and clothing in her old age." Prosecutor Liang instructed, "The government will naturally be responsible for the education of your children. Do you have anything else to say?" Traitor Chu shook his head. Prosecutor Liang immediately ordered him to be removed from the courtroom and ordered the bailiffs to escort Traitor Chu to the execution ground. As he passed by the prison cells, the prisoners craned their necks to look out, and Traitor Chu frequently raised his hand and greeted them, saying, "I'm going first."

### Minister Gu Inspects in Jinan and the Acting Chairman Conveys His Sympathy to the Refugees; Promises to Submit a Request to the Central Government to Allocate Relief Funds as Much as Possible

[Our Jinan Dispatch, 22nd] Gu Zheng_____ on the 22nd, representing the Central Government and Chairman Chiang, conveyed his sympathy to the refugees in Shandong. Together with Yan Guofu, Liu Zhiping, Zhang Jingyu, and others, he personally inspected the various residences of the refugees. Most of the refugees in Jinan live in various county associations and the homes of relatives and friends, so refugees are everywhere in the streets and alleys, and every household is full. Eight or nine out of ten were fugitives from various counties who had been struggled against by the Communist army. The formerly wealthy families have all become starving paupers. Even those with a few acres of land have not been spared, and they have fled to Jinan with their families, enduring hardships. In a family, even if a few young adults work as laborers, it is difficult to maintain a family. Several families live together on broken mats in narrow alleys and cramped houses. In the cold of late autumn, there are entire families without a single quilt. The food is of poor quality, which is even more surprising. Even moldy, inferior millet cornbread that cattle and horses would not eat is still regarded as a treasure by the refugees, who soak it in water and swallow it. Mr. Gu couldn't stop the tears from flowing when he witnessed the situation. When Mr. Gu inquired about the situation of the refugees' families and the reasons for their flight, the refugees wept and said that most of them were law-abiding and well-behaved people who had enough food and clothing, but the Communist army confiscated their land and wanted to put them to death. Unable to bear the oppression, they fled to Jinan. Among them, Dong Zhongzhu, an elder from Feicheng Township, cried and described the tragic situation of his family of four generations fleeing to Jinan after their property was seized, which was even more moving______. The refugees are estimated to number no less than two or three hundred thousand. Their unanimous request is for the government to assist in restoring their homeland by force and to provide relief for their current livelihood. Mr. Gu delivered speeches everywhere, conveying the _____ concern of the Central Government and Chairman Chiang for the refugees, and reported that the government would definitely assist the refugees in returning to their homeland and do its best to allocate funds to maintain the lives of the refugees. He promised to convey the plight of the Shandong refugees to the Central Government and ask for as much relief funds as possible to meet the urgent needs. The refugee shelters run by the Shandong Post-War Relief Branch, which combine education and training, have achieved excellent results, and Mr. Gu expressed his deep appreciation. Furthermore, the _____ Orphanage has no funding and needs 30 million yuan per day. Mr. Gu promised that the Ministry of Social Affairs would take over the operation. Because the Executive Yuan allocated 1 billion yuan for urgent relief in northern Jiangsu, while only 300 million yuan was allocated to the entire Shandong Province, refugees from various counties in Shandong will jointly petition Mr. Gu within a few days, demanding equal treatment. In addition, refugees from more than ten counties in eastern Shandong have gathered in Qingdao, hoping that the government will have concrete relief measures. The _____ areas of Zichuan and Boshan are also crowded with refugees, and unemployed workers account for the majority. They are also waiting for Mr. Gu to inspect Zibo on the 23rd and petition him for relief.

Editorial

### The World Situation as Seen Through US-Yugoslav Relations

After the issue of the Dardanelles Strait was raised by the Soviet Union, causing turmoil in the Eastern Mediterranean, and as the Paris Peace Conference entered its fourth week without reaching any agreement, the situation in Central Europe became tense due to the deterioration of relations between the United States and Yugoslavia. Most recently, the tense relationship between the US and Yugoslavia finally forced the United States to issue an ultimatum to Yugoslavia on the 22nd, demanding the release of the detained American pilots within 48 hours. The British government, while ostensibly staying out of the matter, in fact sympathized with the United States. If Yugoslav President Tito does not adopt a compromising attitude, Britain and the United States will act in unison. Some members of the US Congress have even advocated pressuring Tito to resign. Although Yugoslavia released the American airmen one hour before receiving the ultimatum, the mere presentation of this "note" has further destabilized the already turbulent European situation. Tinderboxes are everywhere; a slight misstep could ignite a conflagration. Indeed, in the year since the collapse of Nazi Germany, the crisis-ridden situation in Europe has never been more severe than it is today!

The direct cause of the deterioration of relations between the United States and Yugoslavia was the August 9th incident in which Yugoslav fighter planes attacked an American passenger plane forced to fly over Yugoslav airspace due to bad weather. The passengers and crew were detained by the Yugoslav authorities. The US Ambassador to Yugoslavia had previously been instructed by the State Department to send a note to the Yugoslav government. However, the Yugoslav government's reply, while seemingly mild on the surface, was in fact very strong, ignoring the US demands. This forced the US government to issue its ultimatum, demanding the immediate release of all detained personnel and their return to the border, or else the United States "will request the United Nations Security Council to convene immediately and take appropriate measures." American planes being attacked by Yugoslav planes and forced to land in Yugoslav territory has become increasingly common. According to news reports, this has happened three times in the past month. The repeated occurrence of these aircraft attacks without satisfactory resolution has naturally led to a deterioration in relations between the two countries. In addition to these aircraft attack incidents, US troops stationed in the port of Trieste have also been fired upon by Yugoslav troops. Therefore, the relationship between the United States and Yugoslavia has been tense recently. The presentation of this "note" is in fact the result of the accumulation of deteriorating relations between the two countries.

According to news reports, the language of the ultimatum presented by the United States to Yugoslavia was unusually harsh, unseen since the Pearl Harbor incident, and full of indignation. A Yugoslav spokesman also stated that Marshal Tito might reject the demands in the American ultimatum. The wording of the reply was unknown at the time of writing. However, given Yugoslavia's release of the American personnel detained for many days, it seems that Yugoslavia's attitude has softened, and the overall situation may improve. If the impasse cannot be broken and the United States indeed requests the United Nations Security Council to convene immediately to take appropriate measures, then we must also consider whether the United Nations Security Council's convocation and the use of the veto power can provide an appropriate resolution to this incident. This will undoubtedly become the most significant test of whether the United Nations organization has power.

From the serious situation in US-Yugoslav relations, we should be able to glimpse the evolution of the world situation. Because for a economically backward country like Yugoslavia to repeatedly instigate events that provoke the United States, everyone knows that there is an international background to this. If there were not a stubborn force supporting her, Yugoslavia would never be so reckless. And everyone knows that the supporter of Yugoslavia is the currently dominant tense power, and it is definitely not entirely an event between the United States and Yugoslavia. To put it bluntly, it is a contest of power between the United States and the Soviet Union. If it were a purely Yugoslav affair, the United States would never resort to such harsh measures given its temperament. Yugoslavia was merely a tool after the war. Those who manipulate and use it are originally someone else. Looking deeper, the occurrence of this incident is closely related to the issue of the Dardanelles Strait, the Iranian issue, the disposal of Italy, and other events that appear everywhere. On the Soviet side, Yugoslavia's actions may be a test of the United States' reaction; and on the American side, after issuing the ultimatum, they also want to use Yugoslavia's response as a test of the Soviet Union's attitude. Therefore, how the Yugoslav incident is handled, how it evolves, and how it ends are deeply related to other issues. If this issue can be handled properly, other issues will naturally be easier to resolve. In other words, whether Yugoslavia's attitude turns to moderation and becomes less stubborn than before is related to the Soviet Union's attitude. How the international situation evolves thereafter depends not only on the development of US-Yugoslav relations, but also on whether the Soviet Union continues to act unilaterally on the international political stage, which is the crux of the matter.

At this point, we cannot help but recall that the Allied authorities must bear considerable responsibility for the development of the situation in Yugoslavia to the present stage. Yugoslavia had heroic resistance to the invasion of the Axis forces and had a glorious page in the early days of the anti-Axis war. After the capital was occupied and the government went into exile, the Yugoslav people continued to struggle. The Tito regime, which was a minority in Yugoslavia, adopted the consistent communist approach of using a minority to oppress the majority, and also used its propaganda tactics to gain sympathy abroad. Today, Tito's rule in Yugoslavia is partly due to the lack of a firm and far-sighted policy towards Yugoslavia by the Allies in those years. It is a pity that American congressmen only today have expressed angry words that Tito must resign, but it is too late. Given the past lack of a firm policy towards Yugoslavia by the Allies, which has led to today's outcome, we wonder if the Allies will continue to use appeasement policies everywhere and plant the seeds of future destruction of peace? As we look at the world situation today, we believe that democracy and totalitarianism are irreconcilable forces. No matter how much democratic countries seek compromise with totalitarian countries, world peace is still unattainable. The maintenance of world peace cannot be achieved by appeasing violence!

### US Ultimatum Rejected by Yugoslavia; Tito Released US Personnel Beforehand

(Comprehensive News from Our Newspaper) Regarding the incident of two US transport planes flying over the Yugoslav border due to navigational errors and being shot down by Yugoslav planes, attention has been focused on this issue since the US issued an unusually harsh ultimatum, requiring a response within 48 hours, as the deadline approaches. According to Agence France-Presse (AFP) Belgrade on the 23rd, Marshal Tito has decided to reject the US ultimatum, but the Yugoslav Embassy in London stated that it was unaware of this matter.

Yugoslav President Tito

### Nine US Personnel Released, One US Plane Lost

[United Press, Belgrade] Nine of the ten detained personnel were released on the 22nd, exactly one hour before US Ambassador to Yugoslavia Patterson presented the ultimatum to Prime Minister Tito. The released nine personnel were accompanied by the US Consul General in Zagreb and left Glibuje, the place of detention, at around 1:00 PM on the 22nd. It is understood that there were two US planes shot down, which were protested in the US ultimatum. One plane was shot down on the 9th of this month, and its detained personnel have now been released. However, the whereabouts of the second plane, which was shot down by Yugoslav fighter planes on the 19th of this month, are still unclear. According to Radio Yugoslavia's broadcast on the 22nd, the personnel of the second plane that was shot down jumped from the air with parachutes and could not be found, and may have died on the ground, with no one surviving. In this case, the issue of the release of the personnel of the second plane remains unresolved. Prime Minister Tito's rejection of the US ultimatum may also indicate that Yugoslavia does not know the whereabouts of the second downed plane and cannot be held responsible. The United States is making very tense preparations for this matter, so that if Yugoslavia's official response to the ultimatum after the deadline is not satisfactory to the United States, appropriate measures will be taken.

Before this news was released, general indications on the 23rd seemed to hold promise of easing tensions. After the ultimatum was issued, US Ambassador to Yugoslavia Patterson flew by special plane to Prime Minister Tito's summer resort of Bled to personally negotiate with Tito. According to United Press International (UPI) Belgrade, Patterson told reporters on the 23rd, "The Yugoslav government has agreed to provide a fully satisfactory response," and that Tito had given assurances that such incidents would not happen again and that US representatives would receive all assistance and facilities to investigate the circumstances of the downed planes. According to United Press International (UPI) , Prime Minister Tito stated in a written response on the 22nd to inquiries from United Press International (UPI) and New York Times reporters, which were relayed by US Ambassador Patterson, that he had issued "strict orders" to the commander of the Yugoslav Fourth Army not to shoot down foreign "military or civilian" aircraft.

### Peace Conference Delegates Focus on Yugoslav Incident; Molotov Meets with Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister; Balkans May Again Become the Powder Keg of Europe

[Comprehensive News from Our Newspaper] Due to the dispute between Yugoslavia and the United States not being resolved before noon on the 23rd, the work of reviewing the draft Italian peace treaty is bound to be greatly hindered. The US delegation did not issue any comments on the ultimatum issue on the night of the 22nd. Only Connally and Byrnes, after their meeting, declared that Yugoslavia was our ally during the war, and we want to maintain the same relationship with them in peacetime. The shooting down of our airmen is disappointing and will only harm the international situation. According to United Press International (UPI), Molotov met with Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Kardelj for forty minutes on the 22nd, and the discussion may have been about the US ultimatum to Yugoslavia. Molotov and Kardelj spoke in a room in front of the Luxembourg Palace, while Ukrainian Foreign Minister Manuilsky warned the delegates that "the Balkans may again become the powder keg of Europe." Manuilsky condemned the so-called greedy policies of the Balkan countries, saying that "this has a obviously negative influence on international relations."

### Italian Prime Minister Returned to Rome Yesterday

[AFP, Rome, 22nd] Italian Prime Minister De Gasperi, who is in Paris, notified the Cabinet by long-distance telephone that a meeting would be held at 10:00 AM on the 24th of this month, and said that he would return to Rome tomorrow.

### Soviet Union Has Preconditions to Attending Japanese Reparations Conference

[AFP, Washington, 23rd] The US government invited the countries concerned to participate in the Japanese reparations conference, requiring a response before the 15th of this month. All eleven countries of the Far Eastern Commission, except the Soviet Union, have responded, expressing their approval. The Soviet Union's attitude has not yet been clarified. According to reliable sources, the Soviet government has informally expressed its willingness to participate in the reparations conference, but has put forward some preconditions, which are being considered by other countries. The Japanese reparations conference is scheduled to be held in early September this year.

### I am Extremely Willing to Contribute to the Arduous Work of the Paris Peace Conference; Forming a Group with France, Australia, etc., to Strive for a Favorable Peace for Italy

[Comprehensive News from Our Newspaper] According to Agence France-Presse (AFP), the Chinese delegation to the Paris Peace Conference issued a formal statement on the 22nd stating: Although the Paris Peace Conference is not directly related to China's national interests, the Chinese delegation attaches great importance to the work of the conference. The delegation will strive to contribute to the fair resolution of all major issues, because the negotiations of the Paris Peace Conference and its spirit will serve as a precedent for another conference in which Japan's fate will be determined. The date for the next plenary session of the conference will be determined by Secretary-General Dubois, but the Political and Territorial Committee for Italy is scheduled to meet at 3:00 PM on the 23rd. All committees will not meet on the morning of the 23rd, presumably because the delegates of various countries have put forward many amendments to the draft treaty, and they must be translated into English, French, and Russian before they can be discussed, which is a cumbersome procedure. According to United Press International (UPI)

Our newspaper listens to Paris radio broadcasts: The Political and Territorial Committee for Italy met on the 23rd and passed the first section of the preamble to the treaty with Italy. All 21 member countries of the Peace Conference, except Norway, will sign the treaty with Italy. Yugoslavia originally proposed including Albania, but later withdrew the proposal, allowing the first section of the preamble to be passed. However, difficulties were encountered when discussing the wording of the second section. US Representative Connally attended the meeting for the first time on the 23rd. According to United Press International (UPI), China, France, Australia, and Canada have formed a group to strive for a more lenient peace for Italy. It is expected that the countries of this group will explain their new position at the meeting of the Political and Territorial Committee for Italy on the 23rd, supporting the principle that the draft treaty with Italy should be lenient, because Italy assisted the United Nations in the war after overthrowing Mussolini.

According to United Press International (UPI), the Iranian delegation of three has left Tehran by plane for Paris on the 22nd to participate in the Peace Conference. The Soviet delegation denied external reports that Molotov had sent a telegram to UN Secretary-General Lie requesting the postponement of the UN General Assembly. The UK and the US believe that there are many important items on the agenda of the UN General Assembly and it should not be postponed, but the work of the Paris Peace Conference should not be interrupted. Therefore, the number of delegates who agree to a partial recess of the Peace Conference is increasing daily.

### Yugoslavia Proposes Amendments to the Trieste Issue

Our newspaper listens to Paris radio broadcasts: Yugoslavia's proposed amendments to the Trieste issue are roughly as follows: The task of the administrative body is to agree on the management rules of the port, prepare budgets, determine taxes, etc., and to appoint and remove the administrative director, deputy director, and port affairs officials of the special port. The administrative director is responsible for governing the special port, all levels of offices, and guiding its financial policy, and is granted full authority to handle everything by the aforementioned administrative body. The section on port management rules should be part of the treaty with Italy. Regarding the disposition of the Free Territory of Trieste, Yugoslavia considers it an agreement between the country and the Free City, and it cannot be modified without the consent of both parties. Yugoslavia's participation in the treaty with Italy is limited to the urban area of Trieste. The area is still under the governance of military authorities, and Yugoslavia proposes adopting a provisional government method, in which the military government should withdraw from the Free Territory one month after the treaty comes into effect. At this time, an international committee should be organized by the US, Soviet Union, UK, and France to exercise the relevant powers before the parliament is elected. The four countries should form four military regiments, each with 1,000 people, with each country sending one regiment to maintain security and order. These troops should be under unified command and withdraw one month after the parliament is elected. Administrative power belongs to the temporary government committee appointed by the international committee. The temporary government committee is composed of six members, four from the Italian side and two from the Yugoslav side. This temporary committee should form a temporary parliament with 60 members, including 40 from the Italian side and 20 from the Yugoslav side.

### Provisional Indian Government May Be Established Today; New Delhi is Under Strict Guard; Possibility of Renewed Conflict Between the Two Religions

[Report from Our Comprehensive News Service] Preparations for the provisional Indian government are largely complete. According to a London broadcast, it may be announced on the 24th. According to Agence France-Presse (AFP) from New Delhi, Indian National Congress President Nehru and others met with Governor-General Wavell to conduct final discussions on the organization of the provisional government. The list of cabinet members for the provisional government was submitted by Nehru to the Governor-General on the morning of the 21st, but it is still subject to change and is not yet finalized. The cabinet will consist of fifteen members, with two seats reserved for the Muslim League, held vacant so that the Muslim League can join the provisional government at any time. Before assuming the position of Prime Minister of the cabinet, Nehru plans to resign from his position as Chairman of the National Congress Party. It is expected that the provisional government may be established in early September, and the Constituent Assembly is scheduled to open on September 15th. British Indian Army Commander-in-Chief General Auchinleck, who previously returned home to report on his duties and is currently in England, is planning to return to his post ahead of schedule due to the imminent establishment of the provisional government organized by Nehru. It is expected that he will arrive here within the month.

On the eve of the establishment of this provisional government, the conflict between Indian and Muslim ethnicities has not shown any signs of easing. The great riots in Calcutta, which lasted for four consecutive days, have just subsided, and New Delhi is now facing a crisis of bloodshed. People in New Delhi generally expect that conflicts may occur between Muslims and Hindus in the coming days because September is the Muslim month of "Ramadan," which traditionally involves fasting and prayer. This year, the religious ceremonies have been turned into political gatherings, and the situation has become tense, with fears that Muslims may instigate serious disturbances following the Calcutta incident. Muslim newspapers report that in the Calcutta incident, Muslims suffered four times the losses of Hindus. The majority of Muslim opinions believe that the disturbances caused by "Direct Action Day" were not only the first battle in the holy war to demand "Pakistan" (i.e., the partition of India and Pakistan) but also a humiliating defeat that requires immediate retaliation. Therefore, there is deep unrest in this ancient city. Police have been ordered to go out and take all necessary defensive measures to prevent incidents. On the evening of the 22nd, patrols were dispatched to key points in the city streets, and police officers were temporarily doubled. According to reliable sources, Muslims are not hiding their eagerness for revenge and their hope to cause trouble in the next day or two. Conversely, Hindus are more willing to avoid conflict but are determined to counterattack if attacked.

### Arab League To Attend London Conference With Conditions

Demands Recognition of Hajj Amin al-Husseini as Representative of Muslims

[United Press, Alexandria, 22nd] The seven countries of the Arab League today submitted a note to the British government demanding recognition of Hajj Amin al-Husseini, the former Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, as one of the representatives of Palestinian Muslims. They stated that the Mufti is an indispensable figure in Palestine and that recognizing his leadership is extremely important. Meanwhile, some Arab leaders expect that the next meeting of the Arab League will nominate Hajj Amin al-Husseini as Chairman of the Palestinian Arab Executive Committee and will send representatives to discuss this matter with the British government. Other conditions include that since Jews have no right to discuss the Palestinian issue, Arabs do not want to attend the conference at the same time as Jews. In addition, the rights and interests of the Arabs should be the basis of these negotiations, and the issue of the Mandate or the Balfour Declaration (a declaration regarding the future of Jews in Palestine) should not be the basis for negotiations.

### Iran Denies Requesting U.S. Mediation in Anglo-Soviet Dispute; Minor Conflicts Occur in Anglo-Iranian Oil Region

[Agence France-Presse, Tehran, 22nd] Rumors that Iranian Prime Minister Sa'ed-Maraghe'i requested the United States Ambassador to Tehran to mediate in the Anglo-Soviet dispute have been denied by the local radio station. It was stated that the policy adopted by the Iranian cabinet is based on the principle that foreign countries must not interfere in Iran's internal affairs.

[United Press, Tehran, 22nd] Several minor conflicts occurred today in the Caspian Sea area north of Khuzestan, which is within the Anglo-Iranian oil field area. The central government has launched a campaign to collect "illegal arms" in northern Iran, and Prime Minister Sa'ed-Maraghe'i has extended the curfew by one hour "to prevent the incitement of trouble by rioters."

### Turkey Determined to Maintain Territorial Integrity and Sovereignty; Resolutely Rejects Unreasonable Soviet Demands; Britain Denies Deploying Troops on Iranian-Turkish Border

[Reuters, London, 22nd] The Turkish radio station quoted the country's Ulus newspaper as saying: "We do not want war, but we are also determined to resolutely reject unreasonable demands. During the war, we contributed to the Allied countries, and after the war, we should also prevent threats to peace. We are willing to support the United Nations organization, but the prerequisite is to maintain the integrity of our territory."

[United Press, Ankara, 22nd] Turkey today responded with an unhesitating "no" to the Soviet proposal for joint control of the Dardanelles Strait. The wording of the Turkish reply was quite diplomatic, but very firm, clearly stating to the Soviet Union that Turkey alone is capable of managing this important strait, and if any changes are desired, they must be handled in accordance with the provisions of the Montreux Convention. According to a Turkish government spokesperson, American intervention has removed the Soviet threat to Turkey. "We blindly accept all of America's suggestions, and we fully trust America and its political views." The general impression is that the entire Straits issue has gradually relieved Turkey of its burden and has become an Anglo-American issue against the Soviet Union.

[United Press, London, 22nd] A War Office spokesperson declared today: "The Moscow radio station's broadcast that British troops are moving towards the Turkish-Iraqi border is completely unfounded." The radio station quoted news from a Syrian newspaper that more British troops are expected to arrive in Iraq, with a portion concentrated on the Iraqi-Turkish border. According to a report from Iraq to a Beirut newspaper, more British Indian troops will continue to arrive in Basra, preparing to be transferred to the Iraqi-Turkish border. Furthermore, Syrians traveling from the Iraqi border to Beirut stated that British Indian troops are concentrating on the Iraqi-Turkish border.

### Sino-Greek Relations Deteriorating; Diplomatic Ties Hanging by a Thread

[Reuters, Athens, 22nd] A "New York Times" correspondent reports that after the Greek government withdrew its ambassador to Yugoslavia, it is now considering recalling its ambassador to Yugoslavia as well. The general public is speculating that Yugoslavia's actions are about to sever diplomatic relations completely. According to most people's views, this move is part of a nerve war in the Balkans.

[Reuters, Athens, 22nd] The British Embassy in Greece announced tonight that the Yugoslav ship "Alexander I" was used for target practice and destroyed by British aircraft after it ran aground. Yugoslavia has protested to the Greek Foreign Ministry about this matter.

### Soviet Union Manufacturing Weapons in Germany; Three Powers Demand Investigation

[Central News Agency (CNA), Berlin, 22nd, United Press] Senior officials of the U.S. military government in Germany stated today that the U.S., Britain, and France may once again demand an investigation into the complete demilitarization of the four occupation zones. This is the result of Britain's formal accusation that the Soviet Union is continuing to manufacture weapons in its German occupation zone. Britain's accusation reminds people of rumors circulating among Germans that there are still munitions factories operating at high speed in the Soviet occupation zone (this rumor has long been dismissed as mere Japanese rumors and ignored). At the same time, there is news similar to the British reports, stating that the Soviet Union is manufacturing weapons in Germany, and this has been happening for quite some time.

[Reuters, London, 22nd] A Foreign Office spokesperson said that after reports of the Soviet Union manufacturing arms in Germany have been repeatedly circulated, it is expected that some action will be taken, but the spokesperson declined to reveal the nature of the action.

### Military Staff Committee Drafting World Security Force Plan; Meetings Are Absolutely Secret and Content Cannot Be Fully Known

[CNA Special Dispatch from New York, 23rd] The United Nations Military Staff Committee is continuing to hold secret meetings to draft a plan for a world security force, but there has been no news of its progress so far. This is because all representatives of the Military Staff Committee have agreed to maintain secrecy given the sensitivity of this work. Therefore, He Yingqin, the chief representative of our military delegation, also refused to discuss the work of the Military Staff Committee when interviewed by a CNA reporter. He Yingqin said, "This is our solemn oath. Any news related to the Military Staff Committee is best handled by the secretary of the committee." It is said that recently, one representative mentioned the progress of the Military Staff Committee's work in a broadcast. After another representative heard about it, he lodged a strong protest. Since then, every representative in the committee has kept their mouth shut.

### King of Siam Arrives in Switzerland

[Agence France-Presse, Geneva, 23rd] The young King of Siam, accompanied by his mother and attendants, arrived at the airport here last night from Bangkok and immediately drove to a villa near Lausanne for rest.

### Impasse in Anglo-Egyptian Negotiations May Be Broken Soon

[Reuters, Alexandria, 22nd] After Egypt rejected Britain's latest proposal to revise the Anglo-Egyptian treaty, the British government's reply will be sent shortly. British Chief Delegate Stansgate spoke with the Egyptian Prime Minister for two hours yesterday and has submitted a report to London today. The crux of the negotiations is almost entirely on the issue of Middle East defense. Egyptian sources are confident that this hurdle can be overcome soon.

### Puyi Continues to Testify at the International Military Tribunal

Surprisingly Says the Soviet Union Has No Ambitions in the Northeast

[CNA Special Dispatch from Tokyo, 23rd] Puyi testified at the International Military Tribunal for the Far East this morning, stating that the Soviet Union has no aggressive intentions in the Northeast. Puyi pointed out two incidents: "The Zhanggufeng Incident and the Lake Khasan Incident." Although the Soviet army won victories, they did not continue to advance, which is clear evidence of the Soviet Union's intentions in the Northeast. Puyi compared these two incidents with the various incidents involving Japan in China, believing that Japan's actions clearly indicated aggressive intentions towards China. Puyi's analogy aroused dissatisfaction from the defense attorneys. One defense attorney asked Puyi: "What benefit is there in presenting such examples in court?" Puyi then reiterated: "I have not received any promises. I am very willing to testify here, as this is my opportunity to expose Japan's oppression of China." A defense attorney then asked: "You have not been advised that if you refuse to give such testimony, what impact will it have on you?" Puyi burst out laughing and said: "This is ridiculous. I am of course here to testify of my own free will." Puyi went on to tell the court that after he went to the Soviet Union, he was questioned by the Soviets. He made statements to the Soviets, but the Soviets did not make any statements. Puyi testified for the fifth day today. Unlike yesterday's testimony, he has now regained the great trust of others.

### Australia Plans to Protest Japan's Whaling in the Southern Ocean

[Reuters, Canberra, 22nd] The Australian government hopes to obtain a Japanese whaling mother ship and eight whale catcher boats as part of reparations. The Australian government has a company with capital of three million pounds as its backing and plans to engage in whaling in the Southern Ocean. The Australian government also plans to strongly protest General MacArthur's permission for Japan to resume whaling in the Southern Ocean at the whaling conference to be held in Washington, D.C. in September.

### Korean Typhoon, Central Asia Earthquake

[United Press, Tokyo, 22nd] The typhoon that struck Kyushu on the 19th has moved towards Korea. Seven people have died in the typhoon, and another person is seriously injured. Other losses include 75 houses destroyed, 112 houses and 45 buildings damaged, four bridges collapsed, railway tracks cut in seven places, 40 highways destroyed, and heavy crop losses.

[Reuters, London, 22nd] Moscow radio said that two earthquakes occurred in Tashkent, Uzbekistan Republic, at 7:37 this morning, with the epicenter about 100 miles southeast of the city of Tashkent.

### Greek Plebiscite to be Held on September 1st; Military to Maintain Order

[Reuters, Athens, 22nd] Greece is scheduled to hold a plebiscite on September 1st to decide whether King George should return to the country. From today onwards, all troops nationwide are not allowed to leave their barracks in order to be dispatched at any time to maintain order. Official Greek reports state that there has been very little activity by left-wing armed bandit groups in the past 48 hours, and the government has been able to fully control the situation in Central Macedonia. British experts, based on official British and Greek reports, stated that a total of 36 political murders occurred nationwide last week. At the same time, with the voting day approaching, both Republican and Royalist factions have intensified their activities, and Republicans have protested to the government about the restrictions on their actions.

### Amidst Tense International Situation, Rumors Spread of a Meeting Between the Big Three; However, Not Yet Officially Confirmed; Truman Arrives in Bermuda to a Warm Welcome

[Agence France-Presse, London, 22nd] Regarding the rumors of a meeting between British Prime Minister Attlee, U.S. President Truman, and Soviet Marshal Stalin, the London Evening Standard quoted a New York report stating that President Truman welcomed the holding of a Big Three conference, believing that it would be the best way to quickly resolve the most important current international problems. If the international situation cannot be improved, the Big Three will meet somewhere in Europe before November. The United States wants to hold a Big Three conference before the congressional elections in November. The Democratic Party's power in the House of Representatives is waning. If the Big Three conference is held after the elections, President Truman will not be able to convince the other two leaders that he is speaking on behalf of the American people. According to well-informed sources here, it seems unlikely that a Big Three conference will take place. British officials also said that they have not heard of any Big Three meeting.

[United Press, Paris, 22nd] It is widely rumored here that the leaders of the British, American, and French governments will hold a meeting in the Atlantic Ocean. Cabinet Director Faure denied today that the French President had been invited to participate in the Atlantic meeting between British Prime Minister Attlee and U.S. President Truman, but said that it is possible that the British and American leaders may meet. The American side considers the rumor of a Big Three conference to be "ridiculous."

[Agence France-Presse, Hamilton, Bermuda, 22nd] President Truman arrived here this afternoon aboard the yacht "Williamsburg." British officials and the public went to welcome him warmly and will hold a grand reception, but President Truman requested that there be no extravagance and that things be kept simple.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 23rd] As President Truman is currently cruising near Bermuda aboard a yacht, rumors are spreading that the President will meet with British Prime Minister Attlee at sea. When Ayers, an assistant at the State Department, was asked about this matter, he replied that he knew nothing about it.

### The Crux of the Three-Power Problem: Mutual Suspicion and Distrust

— Written by European Affairs Authority, Shaw Desmond

Many Russians fear that the United States and Britain will dominate Eurasia to ensure their safety—because in that case, the security of the Soviet Union would be threatened. If war breaks out, the Soviet Union would be unable to resist the power of the United States and Britain. Similarly, many Americans and British fear that the Soviet Union will dominate Eurasia to ensure its safety—because in that case, the security of the United States and Britain would be threatened, and the United States and Britain would be unable to resist the power of the Soviet Union. The fear of both sides is unfounded, and even more, such psychology is a shortcut to death because another war will inevitably result in mutual destruction. Secretary of State Byrnes recently said, "The pursuit of security may not increase, or even decrease, the security of the world." He also said, "We are surrounded by taboos and distrust, which only increases taboos and distrust."

In this situation—where both sides firmly believe that the other wants to control the world—the two sides will never trust each other. From the American perspective, every move of Russia, such as seizing territory, controlling (?) communists in the United States and Britain, and striving to create pro-Russian groups in Eastern Europe and East Asia, can easily be seen as a conspiracy to destroy the democratic bloc and establish a Greater Soviet Union. Similarly, from the Russian perspective, America's Pan-American military cooperation policy, important bases, political loans, as well as the attempts of the Anglo-American bloc, and the emphasis on the propertied class in the Bahamas and China, all prove that the United States and Britain are adopting a plan to first encircle and then annihilate the Soviet Union, creating a connected "Greater Britain" and the "American Century." Both sides' suspicions have no basis whatsoever. However, both sides are busy devising means and strategies to protect themselves and deal with imagined crises. This fear has expanded to such an extent that the resolution of every international issue is based neither on the merits of the issue itself nor on the purpose of the United Nations to unite the world's nations. The most important thing in dealing with an issue is: how will this resolution affect the other side's (Britain and the United States or the Soviet Union) combat effectiveness.

However, Russia's fear is mostly formed by past experience. The United States and Britain cannot change the past, but if they can understand the impact of the past on today's Soviet Union, they can reduce insecurity and thus change the future.

The Soviet Union Secures Its Own Safety By Any Means

In our generation, Russia has been invaded and destroyed three times, and all three invasions were stopped at the last moment. The tragic experiences of places like Leningrad, Moscow, and Stalingrad are unforgettable for the Russian people. According to official Soviet estimates, from 1941 to 1945, the Soviet Union lost a total of 1,700 towns and cities, 70,000 villages, 84,000 schools, 43,000 libraries, 31,000 factories, 13,000 bridges, 40,000 miles of railway, and 7 million people. The Soviet Union's losses in World War II were greater than those of all the Allied countries combined. Therefore, the Soviet people are determined to protect their own safety by any means, as long as it can provide them with security. This stubborn determination cannot be explained by ideological characteristics. However, if someone therefore concludes that today's Soviet Union is merely a re-enactment of the old Russian Empire or a red fascist tyranny, they would be ignoring human nature and the dynamics of Soviet society. Soviet socialism, whether good or bad, is definitely not fascism, nor is it an aggression that develops outward due to the inability to solve internal problems.

Gromyko, the Soviet representative to the United Nations Security Council, said, "The Soviet Union will defend peace in the future, just as it has in the past. The Soviet people firmly believe that the peace policy adopted by the Soviet government is in line with the interests of peace-loving and war-hating people." However, if the means used do not reduce but increase the suspicion of foreign nations, the result will not be peace, but more risk of war. The Soviet Union is unable to seek security from "equilibrium" because the unity of the United States and Britain is too strong. Russia is also unable to seek security from "world revolution" because this will incite the resistance of all non-Soviet countries against Russia.

The Soviet Union Builds Two Lines of Defense, Creating Spheres of Influence

What remains for the Soviet Union is only one path to take—that is, to promote three-power cooperation within the core of the United Nations; however, the opinions of the three powers diverge, and the United Nations is weak, so, as a last resort, Russia, like the United States and Britain, can only rely on its own industrial and military strength and relevant allies, buffer zones, and territories, but this approach hinders three-power cooperation. It is at this point that the Soviet Union feels the most contradiction. If Britain, France, the United States, and China all harbor fear and hatred towards Russia, then how can the United Nations Charter, the Soviet-British, Soviet-French, and Soviet-Chinese alliances and treaties of friendship serve as guarantees of security? As a result, the Soviet Union has no choice but to build a "second line of defense"—creating a vast sphere of influence, although this line of defense is no longer applicable in this age of rockets and atomic bombs. Unfortunately, this strategy has only thickened the attitude of foreign hostility and suspicion. All defensive plans have unfortunate consequences: the three powers clash, the United Nations organization weakens, countries feel insecure, and therefore strengthen defense work, resulting in more new troubles and new resentments.

Up to now, there has been no way to resolve this phenomenon of mutual causation. To resolve it, one must have a deep understanding of the relationship between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. This approach is actually quite simple. The Soviet government consistently interprets the Soviet security conditions as allied co-management of neighboring countries and the division of Eurasian border areas into Soviet and Anglo-American zones. This does not mean that the Soviet Union has territorial ambitions; it is really that the Soviet Union fears that other countries will use the surrounding areas to attack Russia. In the past, in 1904, 1918, 1937, 1938, and 1939, foreign forces came from the northeast; in 1915, from Turkey; in 1918, from Iran and Turkey; in 1915, 1918, 1920, and 1941, from Poland and the Balkan Peninsula.

Therefore, the Soviet government insists on controlling all waterways and land routes that have been used to invade Russia. The movement of Slavic ethnic groups in Eastern Europe to seek unification under Soviet rule further strengthens the Soviet government's territorial demands. Unless there is overwhelming power, the Soviet government will not change the aforementioned security policy. At Yalta, Roosevelt, Churchill, and their advisors accepted some of the Soviet Union's proposals, but since last August, the Soviet Union has believed that Bevin and Byrnes intend to reduce or eliminate Soviet power in areas that already belong to the Soviet sphere of influence.

What threatens the Soviet Union the most is of course the atomic bomb. The Soviet government's response is: to sit tight on new territory; to question the British and American policies in Indonesia, the Near East, Greece, and Spain; to propose counter-conditions; and to prefer indefinitely delaying peace rather than accepting the British and American plan.

Establishing a World Government is the Only Way Out

The current struggle for hegemony can only have one of the following two results: (1) a major war, or a new reconciliation; (2) both sides mutually accept and respect each other's definition of security conditions. The first result is really the end of humanity. To restore the spirit of unity shown at the Yalta Conference, the governing authorities of the three countries must speak more frankly and fairly than they do now, with more honest aims and clearer definitions, and the relationship between the three powers must be more equal and reciprocal. Even to have this kind of unity bear fruit, far more conditions are needed than ordinary old-fashioned diplomacy can achieve.

This business of dividing up the world is really a necessary condition for survival. But it cannot save the world. To save the future, we must have a new concept of world order. In today's three-power situation, there is a lack of the boldness and creativity that this era needs. Similarly, such a spirit cannot be found in the current Versailles Treaty style. If the three powers adopt the methods of the post-World War I era, making treaties, establishing alliances, and creating a League of Nations, then the result will be that this world, which humanity could have had the power to turn into a paradise, will become a barren field full of scars.

What our new era urgently needs is to eliminate power politics and establish a government to govern all nations. To achieve this goal, the scope of the United Nations must be expanded and its responsibilities must be greatly increased. If the Soviet Union and Britain, one out of fear and the other out of doubt, are unwilling to come forward and initiate this, then the United States should use its power to lead the world towards this new goal.

### Hardly Any Room for Spectators in the Gallery, Wen Lantao Still Not Brought to Court, More Than Ten Witnesses All Favorable to the Defendant, Wen Had Requested Bail and Was Rejected

[Reported by This Newspaper] The Wen Lantao treason case, which has been postponed again and again, was tried yesterday afternoon in the Special Criminal Tribunal of the High Court in Shanghai Prison. Spectators flocked to the scene, and there was hardly any room to stand in the courtroom.

At 3:10 PM, Judge Cao Jun ascended to the bench with the clerk and immediately informed Wen's defense lawyer that the defendant's health in prison had not been good recently, so the defendant would not be brought to court today, but only evidence would be investigated and witnesses questioned. Many of the spectators had come to see the "Old Wen" in person and to hear how he would defend himself. When they heard that the defendant himself would not appear in court, some of them left their seats.

Judge Cao then summoned the witnesses who had arrived in court one by one to provide favorable evidence for the defendant. (1) Wu Kunsheng, Manager of Shenxin Textile Factory No. 9, stated: More than a dozen large yarn factories in Shanghai were managed by the enemy army after the Pacific War. At that time, the defendant was the chairman of the Yarn Factory Association and negotiated with the enemy to have them returned. (2) Yang Zhiyou, Manager of Minfeng Yarn Factory, stated: In addition to the yarn factories being returned through the defendant's negotiations, the yarn flower raw materials, machines, motors, etc. that were occupied by the enemy were also preserved thanks to the defendant's negotiations. (3) Lin Zengwang, Manager of Daxin Yarn Factory, stated: At that time, the enemy planned to destroy 33% of the total number of yarn spindles of all Chinese yarn factories in Shanghai for military use. When the large yarn factories heard the news, they successively sold off their yarn spindles. I obtained the defendant's hint and purchased 800 spindles from Yong'an Yarn Factory, and set up a small yarn factory in the suburbs, which was a method of breaking up the whole into parts. (4) Huang Hanzhi, Chairman of the Shanghai Charity Organizations United Association, stated: The defendant has devoted himself to charity for decades, and there were many refugees and wounded soldiers rescued when the August 13th War broke out. (5) Zhu Xiechen, Standing Director of the Shanghai Renji Shantang, stated: The defendant has done his best to preside over relief efforts in various provinces over the years, and the number of refugees and wounded soldiers who have benefited is not small. (6) Chen Huimin, Female Lawyer, wife of former City Party Headquarters Chairman Du Ganglie, stated: When I was arrested in Shanghai on October 29th, 1941 for underground work, the defendant bailed me out at 12 o'clock that night. (7) Zhang Hongwei, Female Lawyer, stated: After I was arrested by the enemy in Shanghai in 1941 for working on the Women's Movement in the City Party Headquarters, the defendant entrusted someone to find a way to bail me out. (8) Qi Zaiyu, Major of the Military Intelligence Bureau, stated: I often reported to the Central Committee in Shanghai through the defendant, and I acted as an intermediary. I was arrested four times in Shanghai, and each time the defendant entrusted Li Guohua to negotiate with the enemy military police to rescue me. (9) Wu Shenyi, Currently Employed by the Military Intelligence Bureau, stated: The defendant had frequent contact with Li Mingyang, the former acting chairman of Jiangsu Province, regarding military intelligence. I was arrested in 1942 and rescued by the defendant. The radio station of the Jiangsu Provincial Government's Shanghai Office was once attached to the defendant's home. (10) Hu Guoan, Representative of the Catholic Church, stated: After the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the defendant and Father Rao and others contributed a lot of money and effort to the refugee area in Nanshi. The defendant also provided a lot of assistance to the expenses of the Tiren Hospital and other organizations. (11) Jiang Jun, Director of General Affairs of Guangci Hospital, stated: When the Shanghai War broke out, Guangci Hospital established the 24th Wounded Soldier Hospital, which was jointly organized by the defendant and Guangci Hospital. Over the years, the defendant has also made frequent donations of rice, grain, and money to Guangci Hospital.

Yan Huiqing, Xu Jiyun, and Others Present Four Written Documents

After the questioning of the witnesses came to an end, the defense lawyer presented four written documents, (1) a joint certificate for the defendant from Yan Huiqing, Xu Jiyun, Zhao Jinqing, Wang Zhixin, and others, (2) a statement that Xie Chengzhe, Administrative Commissioner and Security Commander of the Third District of Jiangsu, came to Shanghai in February 1945 to negotiate with Zhou Fohai, Ren Yuandao, and others to turn against the enemy, and the defendant also participated in the matter at that time, (3) a statement that Zhu Juntong, Director of the National Education Department of the Municipal Education Bureau, was arrested on February 9, 1941, and rescued by the defendant, (4) a statement that Zhang Xiaoxing, a comrade of the Sino-American Cooperation Institute's Shanghai Work Station, was arrested by the enemy and rescued by the defendant.

The defense lawyer then stated to the court that the defendant was suffering from illness in prison, which had been certified by a forensic doctor. Wen Chunnan, the defendant's son, had previously submitted a petition requesting that the defendant be released on bail, and he did not know what decision had been made. Judge Cao replied that the application had been rejected. The lawyer continued to say that the two defense lawyers were willing to apply on behalf of the defendant for bail and suspension of custody. The court immediately informed him that a written application must be submitted, and the decision would be made by the collegial panel of the court. The two lawyers still wanted to argue further, but Judge Cao informed them that the court had not granted him the power to make a decision in court, and that this matter must be applied for in writing and decided by the court after deliberation. After saying this, he announced the adjournment of the court, which was already 5:00 PM.

### Sun Tianchang's Identity is Unclear, Zhang Binzhen's Case Awaits New Evidence Search, Investigation Team Releases Investigation Truth

The Su-Zhe-Wan Area Enemy-Puppet Property Reception and Handling Work Investigation Team, stationed in Shanghai for nearly a month, the team leader Zhang Zhiben, the commissioners Cheng Zhongxing, Zhang Qingzhen, Wu Wangyi, Fan Zhengbo, and all the staff of the team, handled the investigation work with extreme seriousness, successively reviewed the reception work reports of various agencies, reaching more than 70 pieces, and there were a total of 200 conditions for the confidential cases being processed. In recent days, those who came to the team to submit confidential cases were still very enthusiastic. In addition to questioning the original defendant in detail based on the case, in order to obtain the truth of the case, the commissioners did not hesitate to overcome any difficulties and collected evidence in various ways. When necessary, the commissioners also went out to investigate privately, so that every case could be brought to light. The various shady phenomena in the early stage of reception that were exposed by the team were not few. Among the confidential cases that had been received, in addition to the Wang Zhuchen case that had been transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for legal trial and came to an end, the important cases being processed included two cases of Sun Tianchang's secret sale of received materials. Yesterday, the reporter went to the team and asked Commissioner Zhang Qingzhen and Commissioner Wu Wangyi for details on the handling of the two cases, and they said as follows:

Twists and Turns in the Case

Regarding the case of Guanfang Sun Tianchangzhi, after receiving the confidential report, the team once summoned the defendant and searched for some evidence. At 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, Yu and other commissioners and Commissioner Fan went to Sun Tianchangzhi's factory on Pei'er Road, residence on Bei'dang Road, and warehouse on Xi'mo Road to inspect, spending several hours, but the location of the factory and warehouse could not be found. They only patrolled the residence once, which was purely a modern architectural warehouse, with a small amount of goods stored inside. At that time, because the defendant was out, no inquiries were made. On the 24th (today) morning, Yu and others will continue to go to the address to find and investigate. After the case occurred, the Sino-Korean Cultural Association sent a letter to the team, saying that it was also sending people to inspect, and requested that the association's right to speak be reserved. Therefore, the case is very tortuous. The first question seems to be to determine Sun Tianchangzhi's personal identity, whether she has any suspicion of colluding with the enemy, and then determine the handling method. The team is still searching for evidence as quickly as possible.

Emphasize Two Points

Regarding the case of Zhang Binzhen, Director of the Shanghai Economic Experiment Farm of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, who was accused of privately selling received materials, the content of the secret investigation focused on two points: (1) Whether more than 1,000 dairy cows had been received and secretly exchanged and sold, (2) Whether the farmland received had been divided and sold without authorization. The team notified the farm director to come to the team for inquiries yesterday. According to reports: The dairy cows on the farm were received from the Third Front Army, totaling more than 300 heads, and some of the sick cows and dead cows were sold and reported to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. The calves born by the dairy cows were also reported in detail, with files available for review and accounts available for checking. As for the farmland received, there were original registers available for review. The part belonging to private property had been returned separately. Only more than 50 acres of the 1,000 acres of land on the Jiangwan Farm were reclaimed, and there was no unauthorized division and sale. He also submitted the original register at the time of receipt and relevant case files to the team for review. The case had previously been reported by the National Senate. The team believes that if no new evidence is presented in the case, the case is not very serious, or it is a misunderstanding. It is still collecting new evidence from the original informant in order to decide on a handling method. In addition, after the team randomly inspected the receiving warehouse, it was found that 60% to 70% of the internal materials had been unloaded, and there was no accumulation of mold and rot. As for theft and losses, the receiving agency claimed that it was inevitable, and random inspections would continue in the future. The team is still investigating the malpractices that have occurred in the allocation of houses.

Stopping the Receipt of Confidential Reports is Not True

In addition, according to the person in charge of the team: It is not true that the receipt of confidential reports will be stopped and the handling will be completed on the 24th of this month. The team had previously notified various agencies that had not submitted reception work reports to submit them on schedule before the 24th for review, which may have caused a misunderstanding. In fact, in addition to ordinary confidential cases, the team intends to leave people in Shanghai to continue receiving and handling important confidential cases when working in Hangzhou in the future.

### Municipal Fourth Hospital is Being Investigated After Being Reported

According to reports from relevant sources to the reporter: After the Municipal Fourth Hospital was reported and accused of privately selling received materials, the team sent members to the hospital yesterday to investigate with Cao Jizheng and Peng Kezhang of the Health Bureau and others.

### No New Developments in the Forging of Fake US Dollars, Main Culprit Swiss National Weidrele Has Actual Evidence of Collusion with the Enemy, Investigation Reveals He Once Forced the Enemy Army to Purchase Copper

[Reported by This Newspaper] Swiss national Weidrele, a war criminal who colluded with the enemy, has been under interrogation since being arrested by the Garrison Headquarters. It is reported that the copper he sold to the Japanese side was originally purchased by our Central Mint from the American firm Mufeng Yangxing before the war. When the batch of copper arrived, the War of Resistance had already broken out, so it was temporarily stored in the firm's food warehouse. In October 1941, Weidrele, relying on the power of the Japanese side, forced Mufeng Yangxing to sell it to the Japanese army in the position of an intermediary. At that time, the market price was about 10 million yuan, but the Japanese side only paid 1 million yuan. Weidrele made huge profits from this, and his residence on You'nigan Road was one of the gains. Currently, the Garrison Headquarters is still searching for detailed evidence and will consult the Swiss Consulate on the reasons for expelling the criminal from Swiss nationality and ask Mufeng Yangxing to reply in writing about the situation of being forced to sell copper at that time. As for the manufacturing of fake US dollars, there have been no important new findings to date. It is heard that the criminal will be sent to court in a week.

However, after the court's investigation, it may entrust the Enemy-Puppet Property Bureau to execute it. (2) The traitor's property that has been confiscated by the court's judgment shall be transferred by the court to the Enemy-Puppet Property Handling Bureau for handling.

### Leather Industry Appeals for Loans, Unable to Compete with Foreign Goods

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Leather Industry Association hosted a press conference yesterday to report on the industry's plight and appeal to the government for active lending. According to the person in charge, the current influx of foreign goods into China, due to large-scale manufacturing, has lower costs than domestic goods, making it difficult to compete. Although the situation is expected to improve after the recent relaxation of foreign exchange controls, the biggest difficulty for the leather industry is the turnover of funds. The interest rate on the market is at least two cents per month, which is unbearable. The government's loan regulations for industry and commerce require a considerable scale and more than fifty workers. However, most leather manufacturing is small-scale manual labor. Therefore, they hope that the government will consider the actual difficulties and provide flexible loans.

### Press Circles Prepare to Celebrate September 1st Journalists' Day and Commemorate Martyrs Who Sacrificed Themselves During the War of Resistance

The "September 1st" Journalists' Day is fast approaching. Although this year's Journalists' Day is the second after the victory, the city had not yet been recovered and the press was just beginning to be re-established during last year's festival, so no celebration was held. In view of this, the Shanghai Journalists Association, upon the approval of the Standing Council, will hold a grand celebration on Journalists' Day this year. In addition to a memorial meeting on the morning of the 1st, a garden party and dinner will be held on the same evening. At the same time, in order to commemorate the colleagues in the press who fought bravely against the enemy and puppets in Shanghai during the War of Resistance and were tragically sacrificed, a "Shanghai Press Circle Commemoration Meeting for Martyrs Who Sacrificed Themselves During the War of Resistance" will be held on the afternoon of the 2nd to express condolences.

These will be awarded at the Journalists' Day memorial meeting. Press colleagues who suffered during the War of Resistance are also requested to register with the General Affairs Group of the Association starting today.

Dai Ailian's Tibetan Dance (Ba'an String Dance)

### Rong Yongming's Crime is Minor; Released on Bail Pending Trial According to Law; Likely to be Sentenced to a Fine

[Our Newspaper's Report] Rong Yongming, manager of Wuchang Rice Store, has been released on bail by order of the Garrison Headquarters. However, according to a person in charge of the Military Law Office, Rong Yongming's release does not mean that he is innocent. Because Mr. Rong has been detained in prison for a long time, the evidence is insufficient after review. A letter has been sent to the municipal government to provide more convincing evidence, but there has been no response so far. Since the case should not be suspended for long, it has been submitted to the Ministry of National Defense for review based on the results of the investigation. According to the law, those whose crimes are minor can be released on bail pending trial, so he has been temporarily released. It is understood that Rong Yongming's case may end with a fine.

### A 200-Year-Old Giant Eagle with a Wingspan of Over Ten Feet; Open to Public Viewing for Ten Days Starting Today

[Our Newspaper's Report] At the end of last year, a villager in Luoxi Village, Tiantai Mountain, was washing a cow's stomach by the stream when he suddenly felt like his shoulders were being grabbed tightly, and he couldn't move. Looking back, he saw a huge and ferocious giant eagle. (See picture)

The villager fought with the eagle. The eagle pecked at him, tearing his clothes and flesh. When he tried to escape, the eagle grabbed him and tried to fly away. After struggling for about an hour, he was covered in injuries and had to scream for help. Fortunately, Mr. Xu Ziqiang of the Chinese Ornithology Research Society and his friends were passing by on a hunting trip and rushed to rescue him, but they couldn't get close to the eagle! Finally, he fired a shot and hit the eagle's left wing, and only then was he able to catch it.

According to scholars, this eagle is called the "Lammergeier." It usually lives in high mountains and deep valleys, specializing in catching snakes, rabbits, and sheep. Its feathers are all black, its ears are like those of an ape, its top is covered with animal fur, its neck is like a python, its beak is like an owl, its shoulders are like a jackal, its eyes are like a jackal, its back is like a bear, its belly is like a cow, its wings are like sickles, and its claws are like iron! Its cry is terrifying, and it is even more mournful at midnight, sending shivers down the spines of those who hear it. It stands over four feet tall, has a wingspan of over ten feet, and weighs over forty-two and a half pounds!

It is said that this kind of eagle usually grows in the high plateau and desert areas of the Himalayas. This time, it came to the coast, following Allied aircraft and finally fell due to exhaustion. Now Mr. Xu Ziqiang has escorted this amazing bird to Shanghai. After more than eight months of breeding, it has become much more docile than before.

This lammergeier is said to be between 150 and 200 years old. It is scheduled to be exhibited at the Ningbo Fellow Association for ten days starting on the 24th. Shanghai people who love novelty can once again feast their eyes.

### Committee for the Restoration of Factories in the Rear Area Sends Representatives to Guling to Petition

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Committee for the Restoration of Factories in the Rear Area of the China Production Promotion Association, in order to request relief for factories relocating from the rear area and to suggest the organization of joint factories to seek rapid restoration, sent representatives to Nanjing at the beginning of last month to petition. Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Yunwu not only expressed his sympathy, but also submitted it to the Executive Yuan for approval on his behalf, giving a 30% discount when selling enemy-puppet factories. However, the suggestion of joint factories was not agreed to. Now, the factories in the rear area feel that the estimated prices of the enemy-occupied factories sold by the Enemy-Occupied Property Administration are too high (the price of one factory ranges from hundreds of millions of yuan to tens of billions of yuan), and the factories still feel unable to bear the burden. Therefore, there were very few bidders for the seventh phase of the enemy-occupied factory sales, which ended on the day before yesterday. It is said that there were only a few. The committee decided today to send representative Xie Tiansha to Guling to visit the Chairman and present everything in person.

The settlement method will be based on the contract between UNRRA and the buyer. If the contract does not specify, it will be based on legal provisions. If the payment method does not comply with these principles, the person in charge will be responsible for the assets.

### Dispute Over the "Double Bao" Case Between Qiu Tianbao Jewelry Stores

[Our Newspaper's Report] Qiu Tianbao Deji Jewelry Store at 383 Nanjing Road in this city was originally located in Xiaodongmen, Nanshi before the war. On the 14th of last month, it saw a newspaper advertisement stating that Chongqing Qiu Tianbao Fuji Jewelry Store was moving to Shanghai and opening for business at 39 Baoshan Road. Deji believed that it had applied to the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs for registration and establishment as early as 1933, and had obtained a business license from the Ministry of Industry, and had legally obtained the exclusive right to the name, and others should not re-use it for establishment. The two sides then posted large advertisements in the newspapers, attacking each other, and finally took the matter to court. The case was heard in the Civil Court of the local court yesterday. Yao Lianfang, the legal representative of the plaintiff Deji Qiu Tianbao, was represented by lawyers Jiang Pingfan. Qiu Jiahe and Zhang Liantang, the legal representatives of the defendant Fuji Qiu Tianbao, were represented by lawyer Chen Zhen. They argued that the defendant's name already had the words "Chongqing," and had the distinction of "Fuji," and further stated that it was moving to Shanghai from Chongqing, and had published the Chongqing Bureau of Social Affairs' approval to move to Shanghai for business. It cannot be considered that it would affect confusion, and the court is requested to reject the plaintiff's claim. The court ordered the case to be heard again at a later date.

### Witness in the Murder of Hong Kong-American Pilots; Isogai Questioned Yesterday; Applicability of Japanese Regulations on the Treatment of Pilots from Enemy Countries Becomes Focus of Debate Between the Two Parties

[Our Newspaper's Report] Lieutenant General Isogai Rensuke, former Governor of Hong Kong, who was escorted to Shanghai from Tokyo a month ago and detained in the Tilanqiao Prison by our military court, appeared in the US military court yesterday as a witness to testify in the murder case of Major Hook. Because during the trial in the past two days, the defendant claimed that the death sentence for Hook was based on the emergency regulations on the treatment of pilots from enemy countries promulgated by the Japanese government at that time, Isogai was called to testify yesterday morning. After the trial began, prosecutor Dewey first questioned the defendant Yamaguchi Kyoichi, who was acting as a witness. Dewey pointed out that Yamaguchi's testimony was very different from the interrogation he received in Hong Kong in December last year, and criticized the Japanese military court for being extremely negligent in collecting evidence, and even failing to investigate what goods were carried on the sunken fishing boat. Dewey then instructed Yamaguchi to say which article of the regulations on the treatment of pilots from enemy countries was used to sentence Hook to death. Yamaguchi replied that it was Article 3, "crime of attacking merchant ships." Dewey immediately produced the sentencing document at the time, which clearly stated that it was based on Article 2, "destroying non-military property." At this time, Yamaguchi was extremely embarrassed and claimed that it was a memory error. The court immediately ordered Isogai to take the witness stand. Although Isogai was old and haggard, with a very ferocious face, after reading the regulations that Yamaguchi had written down based on memory, he declared that he did indeed promulgate them in Hong Kong in 1942, but he could not remember whether the details were consistent. The prosecutor immediately pointed out that he did not believe that this regulation existed. Even if it existed, it was not applicable to this case. The defendant's lawyer requested that the court either accept Isogai's testimony or put the case on hold so that Tokyo could send a copy of the regulation before re-opening the trial. The court adjourned to discuss this for more than two hours, and there was still no result when the reporter left the court. It is understood that the case may end in a day or two. In addition, two Japanese soldiers who abused American prisoners of war at the American prisoner of war camp in Shenyang will be tried by the American military court recently. The two are Lieutenant Colonel Matsuda and Captain Kawashima.

### Several Money Exchanges and Jewelry Stores in Taiwan Accused in Stolen Gold Case

[United Press Shanghai Report] Regarding the case of the theft of a large number of gold bars in Taiwan, the Taiwan authorities filed lawsuits against more than six jewelry stores and money exchanges in the local court yesterday. When recovering all the stolen goods, it was discovered that a former US Army lieutenant colonel who had been discharged and returned to the country had stolen Taiwan gold bars worth US$150,000. At the same time, it is said that the total value of the stolen goods received by the jewelry stores and money exchanges is about US$1 million. It is understood that the American officer arrived in Taiwan first at the end of the war and received 3,992 ounces of gold bars from the Japanese army and transferred them to the Chinese authorities. However, the officer transferred only half of them to the Chinese government and swallowed the rest himself. When he returned to Shanghai last year, he sold 1,996 taels of gold privately through another American officer. The Chinese authorities only cracked the case after interrogating a Japanese officer in Taiwan. According to official news from Washington received by the Taiwan authorities, the law-breaking officer has already been discharged and will not be tried by a military court. If it is not intended to open a trial in the American court, the Chinese authorities can request that the criminal be extradited to the Chinese court for trial.

### Wei Jimin Talks About Slight Changes in Personnel of Eight Warships

Wei Jimin, Chief of Staff of the Naval Fleet Command, returned to Shanghai yesterday after completing his official duties in Nanjing with the Tai Kang and other eight warships donated by the United States. A reporter from the Central News Agency specially visited him to inquire about the situation of the new fleet. According to Wei, after the new fleet sailed back to China from the United States, it was appropriately adjusted to suit the organization of our navy. Former commander Lin Zun is currently in Nanjing handling transfer procedures. Once the transfer is completed, he will go to the United States to return to his post. Therefore, the position of commander is held concurrently by him. All kinds of rumors from outside are not true. He also said that he did not know the basis for Xu Heng's detention. The fact that Xu Heng has been ordered to serve in the Navy Headquarters has already been proven, so there is no need to elaborate. The warship is currently staying in Nanjing to strengthen training, and will sail to other places to serve after a considerable period of time. As for the changes in personnel of the new fleet, Liang Xuzhao, captain of the Tai Kang, was replaced by Gao Ju. Cao Zhongzhou, captain of the Taiping, was replaced by Mai Shiyao. Xu Heng, captain of the Yongning, was replaced by Wang Enhua. There were no other major changes in personnel.

### All Criminals in the Case of the Robbery and Murder of a Pedicab Driver Have Been Arrested

[Our Newspaper's Report] On the night of July 19, several bandits robbed Zhang Zilong of a pedicab at the intersection of Ouyang Road and Xiangde Road in Hongkou, and strangled him to death with a rope. Accomplices Zou Chunmao, Zhou Yongtai, Zhu A'gen, and others were arrested by the police one after another. Details have been reported in this newspaper. Now, the main culprit in the case, Zhang Changgen, also known as Cai [Blank], was secretly reported to the North Sichuan Road Police Station, and Criminal Section Chief Zhou Nan, along with police officers Zhang Decai, Chen Junfeng, Cong Wendou, and Tang Lunmei, went to the Wuzhou Road market on the 10th of this month and arrested Zhang from among the sleeping crowds. After being brought to the station for interrogation, he confessed to stealing more than ten tricycles, bicycles, and rickshaws in Nonglin Department and other places on Shigaota Road. All the stolen vehicles were then recovered and handed over to the owners for collection. However, he denied participating in the murder of pedicab driver Zhang Zilong at the intersection of Ouyang Road and Xiangde Road. Later, the branch station interrogated the three accomplices Zou Chunmao, Zhou Yongtai, and Zhu A'gen from the Garrison Headquarters separately, and they confessed the truth. They confessed that on the evening of July 19, Zhang Changgen, Zou Chunmao, and Zhou Yongtai went to the Hongguang Theater on North Sichuan Road to watch a play, and discussed ways to rob a military vehicle. Later, Zhang Changgen ordered Zhou Yongtai to ambush at the intersection of Ouyang Road and Xiangde Road. When Zhang and Zou left the theater after the play, they chose a brand-new pedicab, the vehicle of the victim Zhang Zilong, and hired it to the above-mentioned location for a price of 1,500 yuan. After arriving at the destination, Zhang Changgen pretended to pay the fare and took the opportunity to put the pre-hidden rope around Zhang's neck. Then, Zou Chunmao and others tied Zhang's hands, feet, mouth, and nose with a towel and threw him to the ground. After a while, Zhang Zilong died. At that time, Zou Chunmao drove the pedicab away. After his accomplices were questioned one by one, Zhang was speechless and directly admitted the above facts without denying them. The case has been investigated and is planned to be submitted to the Garrison Headquarters for investigation and handling in accordance with the law.

### The Main Culprit in the Shanghai-Minhang Long-Distance Bus Robbery, Su Jingwen, is Arrested

[Report from this Newspaper] Su Jingwen, the main culprit in the Shanghai-Minhang long-distance bus robbery in April, and his wife, Su Gao Suzhen, have been arrested by the Investigation Department of the Garrison Headquarters in Room 216 of the Central Hotel. According to reports, on April 26th, when the Shanghai-bound Minhang long-distance bus departed from the entrance of the Zhongnan Hotel on Avenue Edward VII, it was infiltrated by six robbers disguised as passengers. When the bus reached the vicinity of Bridge No. 2 on the Longhua-Minhang Highway, a prearranged signal was given, and the robbers brandished pistols to intimidate the passengers, initiating the robbery. None of the passengers were spared, and over four million legal tender was looted. After succeeding, they also intercepted bicycles on the highway to escape back to Shanghai. When intercepting the fifth bicycle, the owner resisted and was shot dead. Following the case, the Longhua Police Precinct successively apprehended Jin Long, Li Changgen, and Sun Shuqin. They were sentenced to death by the Military Law Department of the Garrison Headquarters and executed by firing squad in July. The main culprit, Su Jingwen, will soon be handed over to the Military Law Department for sentencing.

### Conducting a Citywide Occupational Census, Police and Baojia Cooperating in Registration

Comprehensive Consideration for the Convenience of Residents

The municipal authorities of this city, in order to understand the occupational status of the general public for policy-making reference, have decided to periodically conduct a citywide occupational census of citizens. To provide a basis for the census workers to carry out the census, occupational census measures have been specially formulated. The census scope stipulates that all citizens residing in this city, regardless of nationality, shall be registered. The census categories are divided into: 1. Employed persons, 2. Unemployed persons, 3. Jobless persons. Children under the age of twelve will not be registered. The census takers will be accompanied by police and Baojia personnel carrying household survey forms and citizen occupational census forms, and will visit households in order of street and house number for registration. Each police precinct will cooperate with the district office as a census area, each street or several streets will be a census sub-area, and each sub-area will be divided into several census teams.

Census Instructions

Occupational Census Instructions have also been formulated, which provide a detailed explanation of the definition of occupation. For the convenience of citizens, Census Taker Precautions have also been formulated, such as: 1. The daily survey start and end times for each census area are set from 7:00 or 8:00 AM to 6:00 or 7:00 PM, depending on the customs of each area and the convenience of the work. 2. Each census taker must knock on the door outside the household being surveyed (regardless of whether the door is open or closed), and after someone inside answers, explain the purpose of the visit before entering for investigation, limited to the reception room or hall. Unauthorized entry into inner rooms, such as attics, kitchen sheds, lofts, drying platforms, or rooms where meals and lodging are all in one place, is prohibited. Those who are inconvenient to enter should be recorded on the door. 3. When questioning the person being surveyed, the attitude should be humble, the words concise, and no irrelevant conversations beyond the prescribed items should be made. 4. If a household with a wedding, funeral, celebration, or special event is encountered, which is inconvenient to inquire about immediately, the survey should be postponed and only the address recorded for a later follow-up. 5. If the residents of the household being surveyed are out early and return late due to occupational reasons, or have gone elsewhere for some reason and there is no one at home, inquiries can be made indirectly from their co-residents or neighbors. If the inquiries are not detailed, inquire about their return time, record the address, and conduct a follow-up survey separately. 6. To avoid misunderstandings among citizens and to prevent petty thieves from impersonating census takers, the census takers should be neatly dressed and accompanied by Baojia personnel. In short, this occupational census takes comprehensive consideration for the convenience of residents. However, the start date has not yet been determined, and it is said that preparations are currently being intensified.

### Measures for Recalling Students Studying in Japan, Ministry of Education is Formulating Them Carefully

Problem Research

### How to Promote Art Education?

— Shi Chongpeng

What exactly is the significance of art education? We can understand this by looking at the curriculum standards set by the Ministry of Education regarding the goals of art courses in primary and secondary schools. Roughly speaking, "love of beauty" and "creative beauty" are innate human instincts. How can we satisfy and develop these instincts? That is the mission of art education.

Although art education has its value and the Ministry of Education has set standards, it is generally not given attention, and schools do not implement it earnestly. This was true during the War of Resistance, and even before that, in Shanghai's secondary schools, more than 60% did not have art departments. Now that we have won, we should catch up with scientific education, such as "atomic energy," but art, which can develop human love, kindness, and virtue, can also be developed in parallel with scientific education under the goal of "education first." Perhaps there will be a day when all of humanity is immersed in the atmosphere of art, moving from beauty to goodness, from goodness to truth, so that the prosperity of science does not become a weapon of murder but a tool for benefiting people, achieving a world of common good, peace, prosperity, and strength.

Promoting art education requires the supervision and guidance of educational authorities and the earnest implementation by schools. From a proactive perspective, there are two main issues: equipment and teachers. Equipment requires funding. If there is sufficient funding, then ideally, art education should have special classrooms, such as drawing classrooms, crafts classrooms, music classrooms, etc. Various tools, as well as lighting arrangements, must be perfect and reasonable. Crafts – such as metalwork, woodwork, clay work, and rattan work – require many tools. Drawing – such as plaster models, sketching easels, and work samples. Music – such as organs, pianos, and violins. Regardless of whether schools are public or private, they should allocate a portion of their purchasing budget to equipment for art departments.

As for the issue of teachers, it has become the most serious problem at present. Xie Haiyan, the former dean of academic affairs at the National Art Academy, wrote from Chongqing with a concrete estimate of the need for art teachers: currently, there are a total of 3,455 secondary schools nationwide, including middle schools, normal schools, and vocational schools, with 24,664 classes and 1,111,000 students. At least 7,500 art teachers are needed (including crafts, music, and art), but there are only 4,500 art teachers in secondary schools, leaving a shortage of more than 3,000. Therefore, many schools cannot find art teachers at all. The Minister of Education reported to the Political Council that, in order to adapt to post-war reconstruction, the number of secondary schools will be expanded by two to three times the current number. In this case, there will be a shortage of 25,000 art teachers in secondary schools. This is the situation nationwide. Even in Shanghai alone, there are currently 240 public and private secondary schools, most of which do not have art departments. Once all schools implement art education in accordance with the standards set by the Ministry, the panic over the shortage of art teachers will be difficult to resolve for a while.

The target audience of art education is not limited to schools. It can be spread anytime, anywhere in the general public. However, art educators and art teachers are a long-standing problem that requires active training. Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, recognizing this, has begun to prepare for the establishment of an art normal school, which will be established and enroll students this semester. In the future, the problem of art teachers can be gradually resolved. In general, art facilities, given the current financial difficulties of the municipality, should be combined with existing social organizations to carry out art-related work, launching various art movements, music concerts, art exhibitions, and gallery lectures, so that the public can receive the cultivation of art education anytime, anywhere, which is extremely necessary.

### China Textile Corporation Holds Board Meeting Today; All Parties Concerned About Distribution Issues; Actual Sales Remain Stagnant; Black Market Driven by Speculation

[Reported by our newspaper] The China Textile Construction Company will hold a board meeting today (24th). Cotton spinning and replication industries using yarn and cloth as raw materials, such as dyeing and weaving, knitting, towel and blanket, handkerchief, and underwear industries, have been closely watching the policy that China Textile will take after the foreign exchange fluctuations and the surge in the cotton yarn black market. The private yarn mill industry, which is closely related to China Textile, is also very concerned about this. According to industry insiders, the listed prices of China Textile's yarn and cloth have not followed the sharp rise in exchange rates, and although the prices of private yarn mills have risen, they have been limited by this. The rise in the black market is due to the unwillingness of a few yarn mills to increase production on the one hand, and the creation of an atmosphere by unscrupulous brokers in the market on the other hand. In fact, actual sales have not increased. Various replication industries in this city are closed or have little work. From the perspective of supply and demand, there is no reason for price increases. Moreover, China Textile's production capacity has increased. After Deputy Manager Wu personally reorganized the Qingdao factories, production has also increased. Recently, many Qingdao goods have been matched with the goods distributed in this city, which can be taken as evidence. As for private yarn mills, they have abundant cotton in stock, and there is no problem with production. Unless there is external stimulus, the yarn and cloth market is expected to be stable. According to sources close to China Textile, the number of companies in the replication industries using yarn and cloth as raw materials, and those selling yarn and cloth as commodities, that have registered with China Textile through industry associations to obtain distribution quotas is as high as several thousand. When the market is bullish, requests for purchase are overwhelming, but when it is sluggish, few people come to the door. Since the foreign exchange fluctuations, people's hearts have been stimulated, and purchase requests have flocked in. The quantities they fill in on their purchase orders are often unreasonably large, so the company has to seriously reduce them, and distribute the entire number of factory numbers on the registration book in batches every other day to maintain order. The person in charge of China Textile stated that they must pay attention to production enterprises to prevent opportunists from reaping huge profits on the difference between listed and black market prices, and stated that they will seriously screen the qualifications of each factory number. The person in charge of the private cotton product replication industry stated that yarn prices have been rising for several months, while finished products are being dumped by foreign goods, and domestic sales are low. They cannot raise prices, so they are becoming increasingly weak in the face of the double attack. The industry has not improved after the foreign exchange fluctuations. If China Textile's listed prices do not stimulate the market, they can avoid accidents. It was also said that the reason why various factories have been requesting so much from China Textile recently is that they cannot bear the pressure of the black market. They hope that resale distribution can be effectively reduced, and production distribution can be put on the right track. As for those who distribute without factories, or those who apply for distribution while the factory is closed, they should be thoroughly reorganized. However, whether the selling business should be distributed in the same way as factories still needs to be considered by the authorities. According to well-informed sources, the cotton product replication industry is gathering opinions and planning to present them to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Mayor Wu to balance yarn prices, and to ask China Textile to set an example.

### Chinese Stocks Fluctuate Upward; Undervalued Stocks Show Stronger Gains

Chinese stocks are still fluctuating. The situation of Mei Ya is gradually improving with the support of powerful banks. Various small stocks are flourishing within the scope of retail investment. The market prices of undervalued small and medium-sized investments are rising steadily, which also proves the impact of the resumption of trading. Popular stocks are rising and falling passively. In the morning, the low prices were Yong Sha 640 yuan, Mei Ya 3,600 yuan, Jingfu 210 yuan, Xin Guang 225 yuan, and Qin Xing 163 yuan. The high prices near noon were Yong Sha 675 yuan, Mei Ya 3,950 yuan, Jingfu 240 yuan, Xin Guang 253 yuan, and Qin Xing 182 yuan. The market turned around near closing. As a result, Yong Sha rose slightly compared to the previous close, Mei Ya rose by half a percent, and Jingfu, Xin Guang, and Qin Xing each rose by more than half a percent. Undervalued small and medium-sized stocks each rose by between half a percent and one and a half percent, while Yuan Lao stocks also rose by around half a percent.

Foreign stocks opened poorly, but later, securities firms bought popular stocks, and the situation changed. Yi Sha rose from 8,300 to over 9,000, and Ying Lian rose from 8,600 to 9,500. As a result, Yi Sha, Ye Guang, Zhi Pi each rose by around half a percent compared to the previous close, Ying Lian rose by half a percent, Asia rose by one percent, and Gang Ye alone rose by two and a half percent and closed at the buying price.

### Unified Bing Bonds Decline

When public bonds rose, a certain household on the seventh floor took the lead and sold more than 2 million yuan face value, taking advantage of the opportunity. Unified Bing bonds opened at 1,400 yuan in the morning, and then gradually declined from 1,400 yuan. There was some struggle in the middle, and it fell to 1,120 yuan. However, there was some support buying at the low, and it once rose back to 1,300 yuan, but finally hovered around 1,150 yuan. As a result, it fell by 210 yuan compared to the previous close. Unified Wu also fell from 1,050 yuan to 900 yuan, a decline of 150 yuan. Jia and Yi rose slightly by 30 yuan, while Ding remained flat.

### Stable Prices; New Rice Arrives Continuously

Yesterday, the digestion of rice in the North and South markets remained slow. The South market received 2,177 shi, and the North market received 3,148 shi. The Social Affairs Bureau sold Brazilian rice at 52,000 yuan per bag: 410 bags in the South market and 1,300 bags in the North market. The Social Affairs Bureau also sold two types of Western rice: 70 bags of rice number 2 in the South market and 150 bags in the North market. Rice stores have large inventories and weak demand. The Social Affairs Bureau's distribution of foreign rice has led to a significant decrease in the number of applicants. Baiyuan goods are scarce and stable. High-quality new rice is still available, while medium and low grades have fallen by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Old rice is stable, but various early-season new rice from Nanjing, Liyang, and Jiaxing, Jiashan in Zhejiang, and Kunshan have arrived in Shanghai in small quantities, so new early rice has declined slightly by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Because the quality of the rice from the port is very good, the decline has been small. The future trend is shifting. Yesterday, the state-owned China Merchants Bureau landing craft "Hua Zi No. 203" transported 3,159 bags of rice and grain from Nanjing, weighing 334 tons and 5975 kilograms. In addition, a barge, number 49, also transported 3,174 bags of rice and grain, weighing 289 tons and 1885 kilograms.

### Rayon Soars to One Million; Silk Weaving Industry Cannot Recover

[Reported by our newspaper] Silk weaving factories thought they could catch their breath a little after the extension of the foreign exchange period, but unexpectedly, rayon has suddenly soared in price recently. The price allocated by China Textile has increased by a huge amount of over one million per carton compared to the previous period. The asking price for 150-denier rayon was 1.27 million in the previous period, but it rose to 1.48 million yesterday, causing the black market to rise without end. In addition to enduring high labor costs and high interest rates, factories are suffering from high costs and all look worried.

### South Seas Silk Sales Show Slight Activity

Australia and India have been gradually increasing their orders for silk fabrics from us. Last month, the silk industry in this city transported 50,000 bolts to Australia. Recently, Australia has ordered another batch of silk fabrics from the China Silk Company, and the quantity is said to be considerable.

In addition, the silk fabric markets in Australia and India were previously dominated by Japan, but now that Japan has no production, they are all ordering from us.

### Yarn and Cloth Brokers Urge Resumption of Trading

[Reported by our newspaper] It is learned that some brokers of the Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange believe that the exchange is an organization that assists both yarn mills and cotton merchants in buying and selling. During the War of Resistance, they suspended business in accordance with government orders, which has been nine years. Now that the country has been recovered, it is urgent to resume business as soon as possible so as to fulfill the functions of the exchange and maintain the livelihoods of member brokers. Therefore, they have jointly sent a letter to the brokers' association, urging them to prepare a plan for resumption of business as soon as possible so that they can contribute their opinions to the board of directors of the exchange and the competent ministry, and promote the early resumption of the exchange.

### Fellow Traders Tend to Resell; Yarn Slightly Declines

Yesterday, the yarn market softened slightly. People were shaken by attacks from public opinion, and fellow traders tended to resell. As a result, all types of yarn declined. At the same time, Tianjin yarn prices were weak, and Tianjin merchants in Shanghai were selling off their stocks, so all yarn except for Shuang Ma remained unchanged. The highest price for double-strand yarn was once hyped up to 2.18 million, but it closed at 2.1 million. At noon, Fangjian still sold yarn at the listed price, and all industries competed to purchase it.

The cloth market rose at first and then fell back, but actual sales were not very enthusiastic. However, there was demand for dark-colored goods in the north and south of the Yangtze River. V Longtou and Minfang had smoother consumption, but Fangjian's cloth supply was still sufficient, so the price increase was not large. However, the momentum of the notification list was increasing. There were more buyers in the morning, and then more people sold, and it fell back again. As a result, it rose by 500 to 1,000 yuan.

### Local Sugar Prices Remain Tight

Yesterday, trading in the sugar market was still suspended by the trade association. There were only direct transactions between companies, with a little embellishment. The prices of green sugar are relatively tight because new supplies have been scarce and production prices have risen. The price rose by another 1,000 to 2,000 yuan yesterday, while the prices of other red and white sugars also rose. The situation is expected to ease only when subsequent goods arrive.

### Firewood and Timber Prices Return to Normal

Imported timber prices had briefly risen due to foreign exchange rate adjustments, but market transactions were sluggish, and prices quickly returned to their original levels. Domestic timber prices remained largely unchanged. Timber industry insiders claim the current market slump is unprecedented.

Kerosene retail prices have fallen. The quoted price for a five-gallon can was previously 15,000 yuan. Due to lack of buyers, retailers have already lowered prices by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan yesterday. It is reported that retailers purchase from distributors for 1,400 yuan per gallon, plus 4,000 yuan for the can, bringing the cost to only 11,000 yuan. However, gas stations still sell at 140 yuan per pound.

### Disrupted Supply from Longhai Railway Causes Surge in Soybean and Peanut Prices; Soybean Oil Prices Also Increase

[Our Dispatch] Yesterday, in the grain market, flour prices were soft due to the availability of miscellaneous brands, retreating slightly by a few hundred yuan. Factories haven't opened yet, and inventories are low. There was a slight appetite for wheat from Shantou and Ningbo, so market sentiment was clearly stable, though covertly tight. Supplies from all production areas are already dwindling. The north continues to select white wheat. Soybean supplies via the Longhai Railway are scarce, bolstering market confidence. Retail demand is strong, creating a situation where supply cannot keep up with demand, leading to a sharp increase of 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Peanut prices also rebounded by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, as arrivals from Henan province were scarce. In the oil market, Qingdao raw oil arrivals continued, dropping by 1,000 yuan. Soybean oil prices increased by 1,000 yuan, tracking the rise in raw materials. Vegetable oil, the lowest priced oil, saw a revival in sales, also rising by 1,000 yuan. Soybean cakes arrived at the docks, with a slight number of transactions, causing prices to rise by 100 to 200 yuan.

### Reducing High-Interest Loans: Interest Reduced to 13.5%

Industry and commerce are currently suffering from four high costs: high wages, high taxes, high transportation costs, and high interest rates. The exemption of export taxes is considered a reduction in taxes. Regarding interest rates, local banks and financial institutions originally charged 16% interest (including handling fees) to their clients. The authorities have ordered a reduction, and the institutions requested it to be lowered to 14%. It has now been decided to reduce it to 13.5%, with no additional surcharges allowed.

Loan Agreement for Salt Including Amount, Term, Interest, Region, Method, and Guarantee Submitted for Signature

[Our Dispatch] The 21.2 billion yuan salt loan jointly organized by the Salt Administration of the Ministry of Finance and the Shanghai salt loan banking syndicate is currently being taken to Beijing for signature by Yu Tianyun, Deputy Director of the Shanghai Salt Affairs Office of the Ministry of Finance, along with the loan agreement. The total loan amount of 21.2 billion yuan consists of 16.8 billion yuan for transportation and sales loans and 4.4 billion yuan for production loans. The distribution of the 16.8 billion yuan for transportation and sales loans to various salt sales areas is as follows: Hunan 4.03 billion yuan, Hubei 5.04 billion yuan, Jiangxi 2.3 billion yuan, Anhui 3.03 billion yuan, Jiangsu (five counties) 1.9 billion yuan, Xiaguan and Jiangning area 500 million yuan. The term of the agreement is set at six months. However, the term of each individual loan cannot exceed four months. Salt merchants registered with the Salt Administration and holding a guarantee letter from the local salt affairs agency are eligible to apply for loans. Loans can be obtained through remittance, deposit, overdraft, and discounting methods. The loan amount per dan (unit of weight) of salt is calculated at 70% of the actual cost of the transportation merchant at the time, plus transportation fees. The monthly interest rate is 4.5%. The remittance fee is 20 yuan per 1,000 yuan, and the handling fee is 10 yuan per 1,000 yuan. Salt deposit remittances are temporarily limited to salt transported from the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Huai, and Shandong production areas to Shanghai for sale, or from Shanghai to Bengbu, Wuhu, Anqing, Jiujiang, Nanjing, Hankou, Yuezhou, Changsha, Nanchang, and other areas.

### Tightening Credit and Flat Gold and Currency Markets

Gold prices were sluggish yesterday. The opening price was 2.165 million, rising slightly from 2.16 million, with the high reaching only 2.178 million before facing downward pressure. After 10:00 AM, the Central Bank allocated 141 bars at a price of 2.1575 million, after which the market became even more lackluster. Transactions were scarce, fluctuating between 2.16 million and 2.17 million. The market was initially weak and then stabilized in the afternoon, with little change compared to the previous day. Prices for gold ornaments, refined silver, and silver dollars remained flat. The informal credit market was slightly tighter, with informal interest rates rising slightly to around 13%.

Foreign exchange rates were also stable. The opening price for US dollars was 3,380 yuan for buying and 3,400 yuan for selling. Prices briefly rose to 3,410 yuan before slightly decreasing following gold prices. The situation remained remarkably stable, fluctuating between 3,380 yuan and 3,400 yuan until noon. Prices slightly decreased in the afternoon, hovering around 3,390 yuan, ending 15 yuan lower than the previous close. Hong Kong dollar prices have retreated, falling from 770 yuan to below 750 yuan, eventually recovering slightly by 5 yuan. Hong Kong exchange rates remain firm, between 750 yuan and 76 yuan. Indian exchange rates are 900 yuan to 920 yuan. British exchange rates are offered at 12,200 yuan. US exchange rates are still settled at the official rate.

### Artificial Butter: Monthly Production of 600 Tons, Cost Half That of Real Butter - A Miracle of the Nazi Era

[United Press, Weiden, Germany, 22nd] A factory in the British occupation zone was discovered producing butter from coal, known as the Inhersohn factory. According to British officers, the butter produced is excellent and indistinguishable from real butter. The factory is located in the Ruhr area and has been shut down since Germany surrendered and the war ended. The British are currently trying to restore it. According to Dr. Inhersohn, the factory manager, the factory could produce 600 tons of butter per month during the war, at half the cost of natural butter.

### Refined Tung Oil: A New Venture for Sichuan Exporters

[Chongqing, 22nd] Some exporters in the city believe that Sichuan's past exports of tung oil have all been crude, containing impurities or proteins, making it unsuitable for use in paint. To improve quality, they are planning to raise funds to establish refined tung oil plants in Wanxian, Chongqing, and Fuling. All parties believe this is timely.

### Longan Prices Decline

Although there have been sporadic sales of miscellaneous Longan recently, the quantity is not large, and the supply is also limited. As the old and new harvests are transitioning, there is a sense of supply not meeting demand, and prices have gradually increased. Yesterday, the market opening price increased by another 20,000 yuan.

### Aged Pearl Tea: Market in Africa; Taiwan Red Tea Trading Also Strong

Recently, foreign tea firms, including Chinese merchants like Yongfa, have received telegrams from Africa stating that there is a strong preference for aged pearl tea, with a willingness to accept any quantity offered. The prices offered are not far from what the suppliers want, and it is feared that a considerable quantity will be shipped overseas soon. As for the Taiwan fine red tea, which has been actively purchased by Indian firms for several days, the market inventory is dwindling. However, demand remains strong, and coarse red tea and scented tea are temporarily used to fill the gap. Therefore, the trading of the above varieties is becoming increasingly popular, and the collection of other varieties is extremely urgent, creating a uniformly active market atmosphere.

### Excessive License Fees: Chamber of Commerce Appeals for Exemption Based on Legal Grounds

[Our Dispatch] The City Chamber of Commerce held a discussion meeting regarding business license fees yesterday at 3:00 PM, gathering representatives from relevant associations, including warehouse, hardware, industrial, silk, Western clothing, hardware parts, shipping forwarding, northern goods, radio, electrical appliance, clock, shoe, egg, auto parts disassembly, and steel industries. According to Secretary-General Yan of the Chamber of Commerce, the industries convened are not legally subject to business license fees, but the City Finance Bureau's collection rules include them. Therefore, the meeting was held to allow each industry to report on the fee collection process. It is understood that the Finance Bureau has not yet universally collected the fees, but none of the industries legally exempt from the fees have paid. It has now been decided that the Chamber of Commerce will resubmit the situation to the City Finance Bureau and the Ministry of Finance for approval of exemption.

Detailed Order for Purchasing Raw Silk Not Yet Arrived in Shanghai; Autumn Cocoon Loan Decided to Continue as Planned

According to information from the China Sericulture Business Office, the office and the China Trust Bureau have not yet received the detailed order regarding the purchase of raw silk. According to the office's speculation, the purchase situation will likely be based on the manufacturer's costs, since the Spring cocoon loans and reeling labor loans were all government-funded, and the accounts of factories in various regions have mostly not been cleared yet. The government is now purchasing, so it's simply a matter of finding and paying.

The autumn cocoon loan will not be suspended due to the increase in foreign exchange rates. Detailed plans and implementation measures have been jointly discussed by relevant parties, and the interest rate will be lower than that of the spring cocoon loan.

### Ningbo Fishery Loan: Cooperative Handles a Total of 40 Million

The 200 million yuan fishery loan organized by the China Farmers Bank is loaned to fishermen related to the Shanghai Fish Market, with the Shanghai Fish Market acting as the repayment guarantor. It has been three months, and the results are excellent. Now, a representative from the Ningbo Fish Market has come to Shanghai to negotiate with the China Farmers Bank, intending to follow the same example and lend 100 million yuan. The China Farmers Bank agreed to lend 40 million yuan, using the Ningbo Cooperative as the borrower. The loan method involves the cooperative borrowing from the China Farmers Bank at an interest rate of 4%, and the cooperative lending to fishermen, with a term of three months. There are two types of loans: credit loans and mortgage loans. Credit loans require a reliable store as guarantor, and mortgage loans use the fishermen's products and fishing gear as collateral. Repayments must not be overdue by more than two periods (i.e., six months). The funds borrowed by the fishermen are limited to repairing fishing boats, purchasing fishing gear, storing and purchasing grain, and purchasing fish salt and bait. The maximum loan amount in Shanghai is set at 500,000 yuan, while Ningbo is lower. The exact amount is being discussed by the lending agency.

### First Shipment of Japanese Tea to the US

[Reuters, Yokohama, 22nd] The first shipment of tea from Japan since the war, 15,000 boxes, has been shipped to the United States aboard the Victory ship "Jackson". This batch of tea was loaded in Shizuoka Prefecture, which produces 85% of Japan's total tea output.

### World Timber Shortage

[Reuters, Washington, 22nd] The head of the US Forest Service, Watts, said that the world's timber shortage is becoming increasingly apparent, posing a major threat to construction projects. He said that South America and Africa still have many forests, but large forests in China and India have been severely damaged. Stocks in the United States and Canada are declining daily. Australia and South Africa are already seeking supplies from abroad. Although South America has reserves, it is unable to export them due to a lack of labor.

### The Tumultuous "CNRA"

— Our Reporter Pingzhai

On November 9, 1943, representatives from forty-four United Nations countries gathered at the Presidential Palace in the United States to sign the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) Agreement. Following this, the representatives went to Atlantic City for the First International Relief and Rehabilitation Conference. At this conference, a historically unprecedented undertaking was decided: the establishment of "UNRRA." Under this organization, the forty-four countries worked together to manage systematic and planned relief and rehabilitation efforts.

### A Grand Experiment

In March 1944, the Relief and Rehabilitation Survey and Design Committee of the Chinese Executive Yuan began its work, with Mr. Jiang Tingfu as the chairman. However, as Mr. Jiang was in the United States at the time negotiating externally, Mr. Gu Jigaoc, the General Manager of the Farmers Bank of China, was actually in charge of the committee's affairs. He worked with senior officials from more than ten relevant ministries and commissions, as well as three experts dispatched by UNRRA, to produce a detailed report. According to this report, the cost of relief and rehabilitation in China would require a total of US$2.5 billion, plus 2.7 billion pre-war purchasing power in legal tender.

However, UNRRA's total funds amounted to only US$2 billion.

As a result, China submitted the report to UNRRA on September 30. The plan and budget of the Survey and Design Committee were largely maintained, but China expressed its hope that UNRRA would assist with US$945 million, with the remaining portion to be raised by the Chinese government and people.

UNRRA accepted China's request. In January 1945, the organization responsible for executing this relief and rehabilitation task was finally established: the "Chinese National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration" (CNRA), often referred to as "行總" (Xingzong).

The work of CNRA was arduous and important, because if the organization was successful, China could quickly recover its vitality during this unprecedented opportunity. Conversely, if it failed, not only would the Chinese people suffer more displacement and starvation, but China's position among the United Nations would plummet. Furthermore, in other new experiments, the lessons from failure could be used as a reference for the next effort, ultimately contributing to eventual success. However, there were few opportunities for improvement when running CNRA, because the experimental period was only three years at most. Even if errors were discovered and corrections were immediately initiated, it was often too late.

### How to Proceed?

Mr. Jiang was not unaware of the difficulties CNRA might encounter. In his booklet "The Chinese National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration - What to Do? How to Do It?" he first pointed out three conditions that CNRA should possess: First, it should act quickly, because "if we cannot complete the things we should do within two years, we will not be able to obtain UNRRA's assistance." Second, CNRA should sincerely cooperate with other ministries and commissions under the Executive Yuan, avoiding friction and, especially, conflict, and preventing all pointless and unnecessary disputes. He clearly stated: "Based on experience, I know that it is not easy for organizations to divide labor, and cooperation is even more difficult. This endeavor is particularly complex because we must not only carry out relief work domestically, but also deal with UNRRA and its affiliated assemblies, committees, and offices abroad." Third, CNRA personnel must be honest and incorruptible. He said, "If unfortunately there are cases of corruption, not only is the loss of materials regrettable, but the government's loss of reputation internationally is even more regrettable." At the same time, he pointed out that having materials without personnel would not make the endeavor a success. He believed that when CNRA's business was fully launched, it would need about 1,500 foreign experts. He believed that if this experiment of extensively employing foreign advisers could succeed, it would become one of CNRA's important contributions.

That booklet was published in July 1945. Mr. Jiang's meticulous planning and enthusiasm for the endeavor encouraged the people across the nation, who were in dire straits, and various places called for CNRA to start working quickly, with a sense of hope. Moreover, because the enemy surrendered quickly, it was even more necessary to immediately advance these efforts.

In the winter of 1945, CNRA arrived in Shanghai, which had recently been liberated. In mid-December, it began selling low-priced flour in Shanghai, and vaccines were shipped from Shanghai to Hankou, Guangdong, and other places. Fifteen CNRA branch offices were successively established in the recovered areas, and the work accelerated. When Mr. Jiang arrived in Shanghai and hosted reporters with Mr. Han Reisheng, then Deputy Director of UNRRA, Mr. Jiang said, "UNRRA will have a large number of aid materials coming to China, and the plan can definitely be implemented." Then, he said, "There will be no famine in China in the next year or two."

Millions upon millions of people who had been trampled under the iron hooves of the god of war for eight years had indeed shed tears of gratitude after hearing these promises!

### What to Do?

One of the most striking features of this post-war relief effort is that it differs from previous disaster relief efforts in that it is "systematic and planned." "Systematic" can be included in "planned," so what exactly is the content of this "plan"—what does the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總) intend to do?

On September 30, 1944, Mr. Chiang Kai-shek, on behalf of the government, submitted a document to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), titled "China Post-War Relief Plan"—a total of eleven volumes! And "various data are not yet complete."

According to this plan, the scope of relief extends north to Heilongjiang, south to Guangdong and Guangxi, west to Sichuan, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia, and east to Taiwan, divided into eleven districts. The total population of these eleven districts is 461 million, of which 266 million in the occupied areas are in urgent need of relief. The items for which UNRRA's assistance is hoped are roughly as follows:

1.  Food—In the initial twelve months, the hope is to import 3,270,000 metric tons. This includes not only rice and wheat but also 25,000 metric tons of fish and meat. Special attention is paid to the nutrition of women and infants, with milk powder and meat broth powder (annual request for 40,000 metric tons), as well as cod liver oil, calcium tablets, and sugar. The total value is over US$150 million. By the end of June of this year, 918,978 tons should have been shipped to China, but by the end of May, only 378,235 tons had arrived, barely four-tenths of the original amount.

2.  Clothing—China requests the United Nations to provide cotton, cotton cloth, spindles (400,000), spare parts, sewing machines, thread, and needles, totaling 140,000 metric tons, worth over US$150 million. (By the end of June, 135,424 tons should have been shipped to China, but by the end of May, only 39,033 tons had arrived, less than three-tenths of the original amount.)

3.  Housing—Divided into two categories: first, temporary accommodation, with stations set up at various water and land transportation hubs for refugees to stay overnight during their journey. Second, assistance to the people in repairing, renovating, and rebuilding their houses destroyed by the war. Here, China requests the United Nations to provide 50,000 metric tons of materials, worth US$5 million.

4.  Medical and Health—To carry out medical relief, epidemic prevention, maternal and child health, and drug relief, while also training personnel, a total of 74,000 metric tons of materials are requested, valued at US$66 million, and the United Nations is asked to assist in hiring 725 foreign experts. (By the end of June, 14,721 tons should have been shipped to China, and by the end of May, 13,988 tons had already arrived.)

5.  Transportation—This is the most important item in China's request for assistance, including railway networks, highway networks, and water transport equipment. The figure for which China requests UNRRA's assistance is 1.6 million metric tons of materials, valued at US$330 million, which is almost equivalent to the sum of food, clothing, and housing assistance. (By the end of August this year, 734,309 tons should have been shipped to China, but by the end of May, less than one-third had arrived, totaling 179,325 tons.)

6.  Agriculture—The Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總) hopes to achieve (1) increased food production (including grains, vegetables, livestock, and fish), (2) increased production of clothing materials (including cotton, silk, wool, etc.), (3) increased production of export goods to seek foreign exchange to pay for essential imports, and (4) restoration of rural agriculture to alleviate farmers' hardship and stabilize the rural economy. It requests the United Nations to provide 660,000 metric tons of materials, valued at US$77 million. At the same time, it requests the assistance of 39 foreign experts to work in China and to sponsor 59 Chinese experts to study abroad.

7.  Industry—The Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總) plans to establish some modern industries, including flour mills, oil presses, sugar refineries, cotton spinning mills, wool spinning mills, cement plants, sawmills, brick factories, glass factories, coal mines, power plants, water plants, machine factories, electrical equipment factories, steel mills, fertilizer factories, soda ash plants, caustic soda plants, soap factories, paper mills, and rubber factories. It requires 8,022 Chinese engineers and 26,983 technicians and plans to invite 351 foreign engineers and 729 technicians. The requested assistance from UNRRA is 190,000 tons of equipment, valued at US$115 million.

8.  Flooded Areas—Including the Yellow River Huayuankou closure, dike restoration, Huai River repair, and drainage improvement projects in the Yu-Wan flooded area. The assistance required in terms of equipment is approximately US$4 million, weighing 9,000 metric tons. It also needs to hire one or two foreign engineers and twenty technicians. The plan specifically points out in this section: "The national currency portion of the funding is very large, totaling 68 million national currency. If UNRRA's assistance in food can be used for work relief, the national currency expenditure can be greatly reduced. It is estimated that the rice, wheat, and other grains needed for this project total 109,000 tons."

9.  Social Welfare—Including relief for orphaned children, the disabled, etc. The Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總) plans to establish 30 regional relief teams, 300 county welfare relief service centers, and 800 village and town relief groups, requiring a total of 7,000 personnel. In addition, it will provide household utensils and tools for the people to make a living, and it will set up 500 nurseries, each accommodating 500 children. For assistance in refugees returning home, 500 refugee reception centers will be set up. 500 food supply stations will provide two meals a day for 1,000 people each. In addition, five training centers for the disabled will be established. The assistance requested from UNRRA is 27,000 tons of materials, valued at US$32 million, and it plans to hire 230 foreign experts and sponsor 100 Chinese experts to study abroad.

10. Refugees—Reception centers and relief supplies require assistance valued at US$5.6 million, including 1,000 tons of materials.

The total amount of foreign-imported materials needed for China's post-war relief and rehabilitation efforts within eighteen months is US$2,530,000,000, totaling 10,000,000 metric tons. China's request for assistance to UNRRA is only 37% of this amount, totaling US$945,000,000, weighing 4,000,000 metric tons.

After this plan was announced in the United States, public opinion paid close attention to it. Mr. Chiang Kai-shek said, "At that time, the feelings of all parties can be summarized in two sentences: (1) How large are the numbers! (2) Considering China's long war of resistance and the size of the war zone, the numbers are within reason."

However, despite being "within reason," UNRRA made an "unexpected" decision. They discounted our already discounted numbers by another 60%, approving only US$560 million for this US$945 million request. Moreover, many of the materials shipped were not in the original plan. As a result, the work that the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總) can do has become simply processing and transporting the materials shipped by UNRRA to the places where they are needed.

### "Exceeded Expectations"

Three months later, the situation has turned to a very serious stage. Mr. Chiang Kai-shek frankly and sincerely pointed out the seriousness of the global food problem. He admitted that "the actual need for food has exceeded the amount previously estimated," while what UNRRA can supply is far below the original plan. Therefore, he had to take the opportunity to go abroad to attend the fourth UNRRA General Assembly to personally promote the issue of food assistance.

He said, "The situation facing us is more serious and more difficult than planned." The destruction of railways, houses, cities... etc. has all exceeded initial estimates, especially in provinces such as Guangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Henan. UNRRA is unable to supply the bricks, tiles, and wood needed to build Chinese-style houses.

New difficulties have also arisen when sending refugees back. Detailed statistics on refugees are not available, and cases of impersonating refugees have been discovered in Chongqing. In Hankou, people were found doing business with morphine and heroin among the refugees.

The transportation situation is also very serious. Land transportation has been completely destroyed by the war, but there are not enough ships urgently needed in inland rivers and coastal areas. This difficulty forced the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總) to rely on the ships of Swire and Jardine Matheson for help, which immediately caused fierce protests from the shipping association, triggering a huge wave of defending inland river shipping rights.

These difficulties were personally pointed out by Mr. Chiang Kai-shek in his speech to the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總) personnel in Shanghai on March 7. After delivering this speech, he rushed to the United States. On April 17, Mr. Chiang Kai-shek told a United Press reporter in the United States, "I am here in the United States on behalf of China to request a continuous supply of food, but I must admit that the mission I bear has failed. UNRRA has reduced the amount requested by China, and the British-American-Canadian Joint Food Committee has further reduced it. We requested 500,000 tons of fertilizer, but only received 10,000 tons. Britain is unwilling to provide China with surplus grain from Siam due to political and economic reasons..." After former US President Hoover investigated the food situation in China, Kilpatrick, the American representative who came to Shanghai to attend the UNRRA Far East Regional Conference, said on May 25, "Washington is deeply convinced that the food shortage in China is very serious, but whether this will lead to an increase in rations depends on the improvement of the global food situation."

However, in Hunan, northern Jiangsu, Guangxi, Jiangxi... thirty million starving people are struggling every day, and the bark and roots of trees are almost eaten up!

### "A Powerful Organization"

When preparing to organize the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總), Mr. Chiang Kai-shek said, "What we need is a powerful organization that is less administrative and more business-oriented."

Under this principle, the organization of the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總) is relatively new and special. Its internal units are divided into four "departments": Storage and Transportation, Distribution, Finance, and Disaster Relief. There are also four "sections": General Affairs, Accounting, Investigation, and Translation. In addition, there are three committees for Industry and Mining, Agriculture, and Health, as well as a personnel office. The Storage and Transportation Department is responsible for checking and receiving materials and transporting them to the places where they are used. The Storage and Transportation Department sets up several storage and transportation bureaus in key transportation locations. The Distribution Department is responsible for deciding on the amount to be distributed and the order of priority based on the needs of various provinces, cities, counties, and various undertakings. The Finance Department is in charge of the sale of materials and the use of the proceeds. Mr. Chiang Kai-shek pointed out that the purpose of this move is "first, to assist other government agencies in stabilizing prices, and second, to raise funds for work relief projects." The Disaster Relief Department is responsible for handling emergency relief, helping refugees return home, and planning work relief. In charge of all the affairs of the entire administration is the director, who is assisted by two deputy directors in everything. In addition, there is an executive director who is responsible for carrying out all business and supervising the various departments and sub-administrations. The sale of materials must also be approved by the executive director first. In addition, the Executive Yuan also sends a representative to work in the Distribution Department of the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總), and the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總) also sends a representative to the Executive Yuan to be responsible for liaison, much like countries sending envoys to each other to handle diplomacy.

Of course, there are also counselors, secretaries, department directors, deputy department directors, section chiefs, inspectors, technical officers, section chiefs, editors, technicians, and clerks—as well as hired domestic and foreign specialists and employees. The UNRRA office in China also sends "consultants" to various departments to "observe."

In addition, in areas more severely damaged by the war, the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總) has also established fifteen sub-administrations (Northeast, Taiwan, Ji-Re-Ping-Jin, Jin-Sui-Cha, Lu-Qing, Henan, Shanghai, Su-Ning, Zhe-Min, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi), with four groups under them: Relief Affairs, Storage and Transportation, Health, and General Affairs, as well as several work teams, each responsible by group leaders, deputy group leaders, and team leaders.

Of course, there are also secretaries, inspectors, technical officers, technicians, group members, and employees.

In areas where there are no sub-administrations of the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總), a "Post-War Relief Review Committee" is established, with members selected by the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總) from among people of prestige in various political, military, and social circles in the area.

Therefore, taking Shanghai as an example, there is the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總) headquarters, the Shanghai sub-administration of the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總), plus the UNRRA office in China. When you get to Zhenjiang, there is the Su-Ning sub-administration of the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總), and when you get to Nanjing, there is still a part of the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總) headquarters.

To give another smaller example: the headquarters in Shanghai has a Storage and Transportation Department, the Shanghai sub-administration has a Storage and Transportation Group, and Shanghai also has a Storage and Transportation Bureau (because Shanghai is a place with a lot of material to be loaded and unloaded).

The duties of the director and the executive director are difficult to define, especially in recent months, the powers of the executive director seem to have waxed and waned. Recently, it seems that the director has become the chairman of the National Government, and the executive director seems to be the premier of the Executive Yuan, but the heads of various departments under this "Executive Yuan" are appointed by the director, who took office earlier than the executive director.

As a result, official documents are constantly going in circles, and when something goes wrong, it is often very easy to shirk responsibility.

### It Depends on Human Effort

With such a large organization and such a difficult task, the problem of personnel is of course very important. In his book "The Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總)—What to Do? How to Do It?" Mr. Chiang Kai-shek's first chapter is "Human Power Can Overcome Nature," and the last chapter is still "It Depends on Human Effort," which shows his emphasis on the problem of "people." The Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總) has indeed recruited many outstanding talents. They are enthusiastic, capable, and many of them have already achieved considerable success and status in various undertakings.

However, even in this new organization, the most annoying phenomenon inherited from the Chinese bureaucracy—sectarianism—has not been able to be avoided. In addition, this organization is also "using both personnel who have passed the civil service examination and personnel who have not passed the civil service examination," so it is not easy to be closely integrated, and therefore it is impossible to exert the highest degree of efficiency. Moreover, the organization of the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總) is temporary in nature, and many people who can find a more permanent position are unwilling to work for the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總). Even those who are currently working for the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總) often try to find a more permanent position. The mentality of "a five-day magistrate" more or less exists in the hearts of every employee of the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總). As for the many people who are trying to join the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總) every day, as Mr. Chiang Kai-shek said, they want to become officials. This phenomenon is more obvious in the several sub-administrations that are "far from the emperor." We only need to look through the records of the questioning during the meetings of the provincial assemblies to find that the most fiercely attacked at present is not other agencies, but the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總), which specifically goes to these provinces to save the people. The individual heads of the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總) sub-administrations who have been criticized are not few, but we have not seen the headquarters resolutely replace them. Of course, the headquarters may have other difficulties, but the fundamental lack of a suitable successor must also be one of the main reasons.

### We Need Foreign Experts to Help

Precisely because there are not enough good talents, some people just come to work every day, perfunctorily deal with things, and then leave. There are also some people among the field staff who are causing controversy. The Storage and Transportation Bureau in Shanghai is even more full of shady deals, and people are gossiping. Mr. Chiang Kai-shek has recruited many "guest ministers" to make up for the lack of talent, but unexpectedly, even among the guest ministers, there have been unpleasant incidents that have caused UNRRA to have to send someone to audit the accounts.

Recently, after UNRRA ordered the suspension of material shipments to China, Mr. Chiang Kai-shek was unexpectedly criticized by foreign reporters at a press conference for the statistical figures in his report not matching UNRRA's figures. Although it was later found out that it was due to the use of light tons and heavy tons, in this situation, we cannot but point out that the officials in charge of storage and transportation in the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總) are too negligent. This kind of negligence could have caused serious misunderstandings, especially when UNRRA's perception of us was most easily provoked! If the director of the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總) often receives such careless information and statistics, can the consequences be imagined?

There are many employees in the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總), but how many are really working hard and diligently? Mr. Chiang Kai-shek said, "The agency in charge of post-war relief and rehabilitation cannot be used as a relief agency for the unemployed." However, there are people in Zhenjiang and Guangzhou who have said that the Relief Administration has become the "Relief of the Administration." I am unwilling to criticize the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總) with this irresponsible criticism, but I hope that the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總) authorities will make up their minds in the few remaining months and use facts to eliminate this criticism!

Mr. Chiang Kai-shek said, "When the business of the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總) is fully developed, there will be 1,500 foreign experts serving here." These foreign experts do not necessarily work in the agencies affiliated with the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總). Many of them are invited from abroad by the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總) after consultation with the various ministries of the Executive Yuan and work in these departments—such as the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the Ministry of Communications, and the National Health Administration. However, as of the end of May this year, only about 400 foreign experts had arrived in China.

China's science is backward, and the lack of technical personnel is an undeniable fact. Among the experts who have been invited to China, there are indeed many who are driven by enthusiasm and want to do a good job in China. For example, Mr. Todd, the engineer in charge of the Yellow River closure project, is truly hardworking and has made great efforts to cope with all aspects. He fully demonstrates the friendship of the allied countries to China. The American magazine "Time" praised him as "succeeding Dayu," which is not an exaggeration.

However, there are obviously areas that need to be improved in the procedures for sending these experts to China. As far as we know, they often do not notify the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總) before coming to China, and the procedures for UNRRA's material assistance are not fully coordinated. The experts often arrive suddenly, and there are naturally delays in the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總) assigning them positions. For example, when many fisheries experts arrive, the machines they need to teach how to use are often not available. Of course, there are also cases where there are machines but no one to instruct how to use them. The funds are wasted, and the time of these experts is also wasted.

In addition, there are many foreign employees in the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總) who are not experts, such as typists, stenographers, inspectors... etc., and the number is quite considerable. Some of them are "borrowed" by UNRRA to the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總), especially military personnel. The Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總) has to provide them with fairly good dormitories and meals, and if this expense could be used to hire Chinese employees, it may not be possible to use fairly outstanding talents. Most of these foreign personnel do not have a deep understanding of the progress of Chinese affairs, but their feelings are often very deep. As a result, they feel that everything is not going smoothly, while the Chinese employees spend a lot of time on translation and explanation. Now almost every document of the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總) has to have both Chinese and English versions. How much time, money, and manpower is wasted?

For example, asking a foreign inspector to go out and investigate the work of the sub-administration, and this inspector may be the first time to come to China, how much can he know? Even if someone is really cheating, he may not be able to see through the bottom line?

And these foreign personnel, in many small places, because of various relationships, often make the Chinese employees of the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總) cast sidelong glances. For example, they are used to riding cars in their own country, so when they come to the Executive Yuan [Relief and Rehabilitation Administration] (行總), they must take a jeep whenever they go out, while Chinese employees must write a note and get it approved if they want to take a car. Although their position is high, they are often not as free as a small foreign typist—it is clearly an agency affiliated with the Executive Yuan, but it has taken on the style of a foreign firm!

### Beyond Politics, One Heart and Mind

In his introduction to Mr. Li Men, the first director of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), Mr. Chiang said, "Mr. Li Men previously served as the Governor of New York State for eight years and has rich administrative experience. His political ideas are also very close to those of the late President Roosevelt. He is now detached from politics, leading UNRRA with one heart and mind to seek the well-being of the suffering people after the war." Indeed, to ensure that relief and rehabilitation work is done well, "detachment from politics" and "one heart and mind" are necessary conditions. However, "detachment from politics" is a very difficult thing.

When the Chinese National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CNRRA) transports supplies in mainland China, it often encounters situations where it is blocked and intercepted by the military. Machines used for river management are also blown up. Restoring transportation networks such as railways and highways was originally the largest part of CNRRA's plan, requiring far more assistance from UNRRA than the total amount of food and clothing requested. But how complex are the political relationships included in this transportation restoration issue?

If the transportation problem cannot be solved, then widespread relief is out of the question. Relief supplies designated for Guangxi arrived in Guangdong, and the Guangdong branch of CNRRA intercepted them for the people of Guangdong, leaving Guangxi with nothing. Mayor Wu of Shanghai once said that if the rice and grain really did not arrive, he would decide to use CNRRA's food first. Although this matter was not actually implemented, the author saw Mayor Wu's expression when he said these words that day—he really intended to do so. [Continued on Page 9]

### An Outline of Mountain Administration in Taiwan Province: New Cells of the Chinese Nation

— Taiwan Air Dispatch, 18th, by He Minxian

The mountain people of Taiwan Province (referred to as "aborigines" by the Japanese) comprise seven tribes, with a population of 151,470, scattered throughout the mountainous areas of various counties. In the past, the Japanese discriminated against them as an inferior race, established a "Department of Aboriginal Affairs" to implement special administrative measures, controlled everything with the police, and adopted a policy of both appeasement and isolation, with very little interaction with the residents of the plains. They established trading posts to control their economy and established educational institutions to imprison their minds. For fifty years, the initial Japanese oppression and suppression, followed by education and industry promotion, aimed to alienate their hearts, enslave their minds, and gradually eliminate and exterminate them. Therefore, to this day, the culture of these tribes remains backward, production is poor, and they still live a primitive life. After the restoration, Governor Chen of Taiwan Province, recognizing this, based on the principle of ethnic equality, decided to universalize education, emphasize hygiene, guide production, and improve living conditions to help them become self-reliant and raise their intellectual standards. At the same time, he organized mountain inspection teams and a Mountain Administration Research Committee, sending personnel to the mountains with goods to comfort the people and conduct on-the-ground investigations as a basis for policy implementation. In recent months, the planning, implementation, and results of mountain administration in Taiwan Province have been of interest to readers everywhere. The following is a report based on interviews with relevant parties by the reporter:

Investigation and Research: The Mountain Inspection Team was organized by one person from each department, bureau, and committee, totaling more than twenty people. They departed in three groups in February of this year. Each group had a leader and members. The first group went to the mountainous areas of Taipei, Hsinchu, and Taichung counties; the second group went to the Alishan area of Chiayi; and the third group went to the Hualien area. The journey lasted for half a month, covering more than 500 kilometers. Each member experienced hardships and dangers, penetrating deep into the mountains. Fortunately, the results were satisfactory. After the inspection, the opinions and requests of representatives of various tribes were combined, and the actual situation and experiences of the inspection were carefully studied. A detailed and concrete "Outline of Mountain Administrative Facility Plans" was drafted as a guideline for implementation.

Five-Year Plan: The Provincial Governor's Office, to assist mountain compatriots, raise their culture, and improve their lives so that they are equal to their counterparts in the plains, has specially formulated the "Outline of Mountain Administrative Facility Plans in Taiwan Province" for implementation. It contains detailed, appropriate, and thorough plans regarding the objects and steps of the facilities. It was decided to strengthen various facilities through ordinary administrative methods, with an initial period of five years. The results of the implementation will be followed by a second phase of the plan, aiming to raise the intellectual level and living ability of mountain compatriots to the same level as the people in the plains within a short period of ten years.

Distribution of the Seven Tribes: The targets of the mountain administrative facilities are the seven tribes, as mentioned before, living in the high mountains. Their distribution areas are as follows:

(1) Tayal Tribe—Distributed in Wenshan, Luodong, and Suao in Taipei County; Daxi, Zhudong, and Dahu in Hsinchu County; Dongshi in Taichung County; Nenghao in Taichung County; and Hualien in Hualien Port.

(2) Bunun Tribe—Distributed in Nenghao, Xingao, Fenglin and Yuli in Hualien County; and Taitung in Taitung County.

(3) Tsou Tribe—Distributed in Chiayi in Tainan County and Qishan in Kaohsiung County.

(4) Paiwan Tribe—Distributed in Qishan in Kaohsiung County, Pingtung, Chaozhou, Hengchun, and Taitung in Taitung.

(5) Amis Tribe—Distributed in Hualien, Fenglin, and Yuli in Hualien County, and Xingang in Taitung County.

(6) Yami Tribe—Concentrated on Hongtou Island in the Taitung District of Taitung County.

(7) Saisiyat Tribe—Concentrated in Zhunan District of Hsinchu County.

Implementation Steps: Now that the mountain administration plan has been determined, the steps for administrative facilities have also been carefully and prudently considered, differentiating between urgency and importance, and are specified in detail as follows:

(1) Organization—The Department of Civil Affairs invites relevant departments, bureaus, and offices to organize a Mountain Administration Research Committee to study and improve various mountain facilities. It also organizes a Mountain Administration Inspection Team to investigate the actual conditions in the mountains, integrate research, and improve mountain administrative facilities.

(2) Autonomy—Construct mountain autonomous institutions, organize township public offices and village offices, prepare for local autonomous undertakings in the mountains, and elect township representatives to establish representative bodies.

(3) Training—Train mountain autonomous personnel, establish a mountain personnel system to ensure peace of mind, and increase the salaries of mountain workers to encourage motivated young people to serve.

(4) Education—The "Aboriginal Children's Education Centers" previously run by the Japanese in mountain villages will be uniformly converted into national schools, and adult education will be conducted. Promote the National Language and National Script Movement, and establish the same facilities as those in the plains. Abolish the Japanese system of discriminating against mountain compatriots to raise the cultural level of mountain compatriots. Establish secondary schools to cultivate mountain youth, and establish public-funded scholarships to encourage them to study at universities.

(5) Health—Establish health clinics and malaria prevention centers in mountain villages, and organize a mountain mobile medical team by the province to provide regular medical care and guide mountain compatriots in basic hygiene knowledge to promote their physical health.

(6) Cooperation—Guide the organization of mountain village cooperatives to handle the supply and sales of mountain materials, so that the economic organization of mountain compatriots can be established, avoid exploitation by merchants, and improve their lives.

(7) Production—Expand mountain production undertakings, establish agricultural training centers and vocational training centers in mountain areas of each county, cultivate specialized agricultural technicians in mountain areas, develop mountain industries, and improve various mountain handicrafts to increase the income of mountain compatriots.

(8) Transportation—Construct mountain roads and bridges to facilitate mountain transportation.

(9) Self-Defense—To strengthen the self-defense capabilities of mountain areas, train mountain police personnel and send them back to the mountains to engage in security work to improve their self-defense capabilities.

(10) Customs—The customs and habits of mountain compatriots are different from those of the plains, and have been followed for a long time, which is an important obstacle to ethnic assimilation. Actively find ways to reform their bad customs and habits.

Administrative Organization: To meet the needs of the current stage and to coordinate with the implementation of the five-year plan in order to develop in parallel with the plains, the organization has been strengthened to meet the needs and achieve twice the result with half the effort.

(1) At the Provincial Level—Initially, the first section of the Department of Civil Affairs of the Provincial Administrative Governor's Office took over the affairs of the Aboriginal Affairs Section of the former Taiwan Governor-General's Office and established a Mountain Administration Section to handle mountain administrative affairs. The relevant units still cooperated with each department to handle it. Recently, in order to focus on the implementation of mountain administrative work, the original Mountain Administration Section has been changed to the Third Section to handle it, still cooperating with each department to work together, so that mountain administration and plain administration have the same facilities, eliminating the discriminatory concepts of the past Japanese government and implementing the spirit of ethnic equality.

(2) At the County Level—Each county government (section) of the Civil Affairs Bureau (Section) in all counties where mountain compatriots live has a Mountain Administration Section and a Mountain Administration Instructor, while the district office designates personnel from the Civil Affairs Section to be responsible for mountain administration.

(3) At the Township Level—Township public offices and village offices are organized in the same way as in the plains in the mountainous areas of each county, abolishing the past tribal society and chieftain system, and also abolishing the police-controlled agencies of the past, using autonomous administrative agencies for active management and guidance.

Professional Ethics: In order to expedite the promotion of mountain work in various counties, seventeen articles of service rules for mountain workers in various counties have also been formulated. The contents clearly define the distinction between the duties, ethics, and powers of the workers. Finally, it clearly points out the position and importance of mountain workers, and ensures their livelihood, and encourages them to continue serving for a long time (unless there are illegal or dereliction of duty). Within five years of employment, they must not change their minds and request a transfer, in order to give them time to show their talents. The workers themselves must not ask for leave arbitrarily without proper reasons, and must not leave their posts without permission. Even if leave is granted, it is only for three days. Beyond this, they must report to the Department of Civil Affairs for approval. This shows how much the provincial authorities value and strictly control this group of workers, so that they can work hard and tirelessly to seek the welfare of mountain compatriots and promote national policy for the government.

Support for Public Opinion: Mountain public opinion bodies are also being established in the same way as in the plains to train their autonomy and instill in them a sense of nation and ethnicity. Mountain compatriots have now taken the citizen oath. Each village holds a village meeting, and each township elects township representatives to form a township representative council. As for the election of provincial councilors in Taiwan this time, mountain compatriots are also encouraged to compete. Therefore, not only are there as many as ten county councilors elected, but also 206 township representatives. This unprecedented initiative is an unparalleled glory for mountain compatriots.

Subsidized Expenses: The amount of expenses required to carry out various mountain administrative businesses is quite large, but in order to achieve the ideal requirements, the Taiwan authorities have subsidized all of the mountain administrative expenses of 39,457,800 yuan (Taiwan dollars) for each county this year from the provincial treasury, so that everything can proceed according to plan.

Correcting Misunderstandings: Mountain people have always liked firearms because of their hunting activities. Although there is a lot of information from various sources, there are no signs of hoarding military fire and out-of-bounds attempts based on the current popular sentiment and facts. At the same time, the authorities have repeatedly ordered the relevant county governments to continue to pay close attention to prevent accidents. The county magistrates are very clear about the history and habits of the mountain people, so they can handle mountain facilities carefully. Because there are many misunderstandings about this point, the statements of the relevant responsible persons to the reporter are mentioned here.

Mutual Exchange: In order to achieve the first step of household registration in the plains and towns, mountain compatriots have household registration in mountain villages, and compatriots in the plains have the first and second steps to achieve no distinction between mountain and plain in administrative autonomy, no boundaries between mountain and plain in culture and economy, that is, no mountain and plain colors in language habits. Therefore, the authorities are still planning to gradually relocate and settle people, select reclamation areas, relocate the population of the plains, and live and produce together with mountain compatriots. However, for the time being, people in the plains are still restricted from entering the mountains to prevent cunning people from taking the opportunity to deceive the kind mountain people.

Final Goal: The biggest key to ethnic harmony and integration lies in "marriage," and the final goal of mountain administration in the province is to gradually promote and encourage intermarriage, break down boundaries, and assimilate invisibly. Therefore, in the future, we will also consider the actual situation and formulate reward regulations to promote intermarriage between mountain and plain compatriots, in order to form new cells of the Chinese nation.

Work Performance: Since the implementation of mountain administration, the work performance in various aspects, such as the universal establishment of national schools in various villages, the establishment of health centers in townships, the establishment of malaria prevention centers in villages, and the establishment of agricultural training centers in counties. At present, there are a total of 30 mountain township public offices, 177 village offices, 177 national schools in townships and villages, 30 township health centers, and 110 village malaria prevention centers in the province. In addition, agricultural training centers have been established in seven counties, including Taipei, Hsinchu, Taichung, Tainan, Kaohsiung, Taitung, and Hualien, to carry out mountain work separately. In addition, guiding the organization of cooperative societies at all levels to replace transactions that deprive mountain compatriots of their interests, and building roads and bridges to facilitate mountain transportation, are all important policies that are being actively handled. They have all been gradually realized, and two mountain middle schools in Taipei and Kaohsiung counties are also actively preparing.

The promotion of mountain administration is going smoothly at present. In the near future, we will be able to see them standing shoulder to shoulder with the people of the plains and working together to build a new Taiwan based on the Three Principles of the People.

### The Tragic Case in Northeastern Anhui: Our Newspaper's Dispatch from Bengbu on the 21st

— Correspondent Qian Mengchao

The few counties in northeastern Anhui Province have always seemed to be places that are not very noticed. Now, in this vast wilderness, there is war, floods, famine, and pestilence constantly changing, and it seems like a heartbreaking picture.

It is said that the few counties in northeastern Anhui Province refer to the areas occupied and disturbed by the communist army in recent years. It is best to take Hongze Lake as the center point first; the so-called northeastern Anhui refers to the counties of Xuyi, Tianchang, Wuhe, Sixian, and Lingbi on the outer periphery of the lake. Readers should not underestimate these remote small counties. Xuyi was originally a mountain city where Sun Xin, the grandson of King Huai of Chu—Emperor Yi, established his capital, and Lingbi was the site of Gaixia, where Xiang Yu, the Overlord of Western Chu, was encircled and annihilated by Emperor Gaozu of Han. There is also a burial place to commemorate in the east of the county seat.

The Shores of Hongze Lake Can't Bear to Talk About the Past

The area close to Hongze Lake has always been interwoven with ports and rivers, and covered with reeds. In the past, it was really like Luoma Lake in Ping opera, and it could be called a den of thieves. The lake is full of water chestnuts and lotus roots, and fish and shrimp breed. If it is a time of peace, the water conservancy is rich, and the products are abundant. If the residents have a way to feed themselves, why would they be willing to ambush and hide, and live the life of Liangshanpo!

Outside the lake, the plains are vast and boundless, and the soil is fertile. Agriculture is particularly developed in this area. There are big landlords with feudal overtones, and tenants are the landlords' serfs. In peaceful times, they lived in abundance and without worry. In some places, it is really "fields looking at each other, chickens and dogs hearing each other, and never interacting with each other until old age." In this sincere and simple rural society, it is not unusual. Now, more than eight million people in the northeastern corner of Anhui Province have been unable to withstand the oppression of the communist army, the ravages of war, the exploitation of corruption, the invasion of disasters, and the torment of pestilence. Most of them are struggling on the brink of starvation and migrating on the road of exile, living a subhuman life.

Innocent People Driven to Be Cannon Fodder

The communist army, which is entrenched in the cities, towns, and villages of Xu, Tian, Wu, Si, and Ling, is simply the devil in the world. They have a bloody rule over the people in the so-called "liberated areas," and there is no atmosphere of democracy at all. In the past year, they have killed, tied up, and fought like practical jokes, and looking for rent is like opening their hearts, making the common people like ants on a hot pot, turning around and around, unable to find a way out; unexpectedly, a thunderbolt sounded, and the war in northern Jiangsu broke out. The communist army gathered five or six thousand, and several divisions of the national army arrived. In the sultry atmosphere, the artillery fire was continuous, and the people were killed and starved to death under the sound of guns and shadows. It is really countless. The reporter's hometown was originally a small village in the border area between Jiangsu and Anhui, but unexpectedly, it was burned by the war last month. Twelve residents of the village were injured by artillery shells. The reporter's sister-in-law and nephew, mother and son, were killed by the bombing. In addition, several younger brothers and nephews were injured and went to Xuzhou for treatment.

Wang Yaqian, the communist county magistrate of Wuhe, first dug up the Huai Dike to flood farmland and destroy roads in order to prevent the National Army from mobilizing. As a result, the area outside Wuhe City suddenly became a swamp. The communist army in the southern township of Lingbi destroyed the Huaihe embankment in order to respond. Because the Huaihe River is a tributary of the Huai River, if the Huaihe River breaches its banks, the Huai River cannot but be affected.

Su County is also one of the counties in northeastern Anhui Province. The county seat is a medium-sized station on the southern line of the Jinpu Railway. After the victory, it was garrisoned by the National Army, but the communist army appeared in the surrounding villages from time to time, threatening traffic. The county magistrate, Zheng Huaidan, was also commissioned to help collect grain and force the use of resistance currency. The puppet county government was located in Suixikou. Recently, due to the National Army's suppression, in addition to attacking them and fleeing east and west, they suddenly dug up the river dikes in Quefosi, Jieshoudian, Yanqiao and other places at the junction of Su County and Yongcheng a few days ago. Among them, the Ba River was flooded, and the water was three or four feet deep on the flat ground. In addition to the cloud rain disaster, locusts harmed the people in an area of about ten kilometers in western Su County, and the sound of crying shook the wilderness, which was unbearable to hear.

After the Yellow River overflowed eastward, the water level of the Huai River rose sharply. Today (21st), the water level here has risen to 20.19 meters, exceeding the record of the highest flood level of 20.17 meters in 20 years. Many embankments along the Huai River have been washed away. The river area in the city of Bengbu has been flooded. The water depth on the road is at ankle level. If the Huai River continues to rise, Bengbu will be in danger of sinking. The flood prevention agencies are stepping up their efforts to block and defend. Since the surrounding counties and towns are under the disaster of natural and man-made disasters, the business here has been greatly affected, the market is depressed, and business is sluggish, completely shrouded in the shadow of depression. If this continues, industry and commerce will fall into the abyss of collapse. The Chamber of Commerce has sent representatives to Beijing to petition for industrial and commercial loans, hoping that the amount will be at least 50,000,000,000 yuan to save this crisis.

Fortunately, after the National Army bravely attacked, in a scene of bloody hand-to-hand combat, it successively recovered the five counties of Tian, Xu, Si, Wu, and Ling. When the communist army was about to retreat in Lingbi, it buried landmines inside and outside the city, hoping to harm our military and civilians entering the city. After the National Army entered the city, it searched and excavated more than 100 mines. Due to a moment of carelessness, one exploded inside the West Gate, killing an old woman, and one exploded outside the South Gate, injuring a child. The cruelty of the Communist Party is so great.

After the war in the five counties, it was truly a scene of devastation. The city area was full of rubble, and the countryside was desolate. The survivors who returned after the war had problems with food and lodging. "The fields and gardens are desolate after the war, and the flesh and blood are displaced on the road." This is a true picture of the current situation in northeastern Anhui.

### The Assassination of Zhang Yanmao

The assassination of Zhang Yanmao, Secretary-General of the Henan Provincial Party Headquarters, in Bian (Kaifeng) has caused great concern in all quarters. The authorities are also investigating the case in separate directions to apprehend the murderers and find out the truth. According to investigations, Zhang received an anonymous threatening letter on July 5, which read: "To the recipient, we are strangers, so let's not be polite. Recently, I was ordered to assassinate you, and I have no choice. But in good conscience, if it weren't for my help, even ten of you would have been shot. I hope you will find a way to leave Bian, and I have ordered three to five people to carefully identify your Dongfu. It would be best if you could take a car and avoid taking the old route. We will talk again when we meet in the future. Yours truly, scribbling on paper." After receiving the letter, his comrades all advised him to be careful. However, Zhang, who had dedicated himself to the revolution and traveled around for decades, spending his days in life-and-death situations, remained unmoved. Later, after the Kunming Li Wen case occurred one after another, friends and colleagues urged him even more earnestly, pointing out that the current political situation was very different from the past, and that ambitious people were trying to create chaos, stir up trouble, and shake society to increase the difficulties of the central government. Moreover, the situation in central Henan was particularly bad, and since you (referring to Zhang) came to the province, those who liked to create chaos had their shackles difficult to break free from, and their accumulated hatred might lead them to commit such a heinous act. They repeatedly advised him to take care of himself. Zhang replied that peaceful negotiations were what people across the country desired, and looking around internally and externally, there were shocks and dangers, and peaceful unity should already be the common pursuit of enlightened and knowledgeable people. Even if ambitious people harbored different ambitions, they would probably not resort to such measures. Moreover, revolutionary party members like them should be at the forefront of the people, and at this difficult time, if they could not correct the chaos and return to righteousness, but instead escaped danger and avoided hardship, living in concealment, even they would feel ashamed. If something unexpected happened, even if they died in their posts, they would have no regrets. How could they seek to avoid it? Although his comrades felt it was dangerous, they could not change his mind. When Zhou Enlai arrived in Bian to inspect the Yellow River blockage project, Zhang's belief in the future of peace became even stronger, and he paid even less attention to his own safety. However, Zhou left Bian on the 21st, and Zhang was killed on the morning of the 23rd. All parties are extremely saddened and angered by this. Zhang's life was upright and heroic, and he was indeed deeply envied by those who opposed the central government and harbored political ambitions. Here is a brief outline to provide reference for those concerned about this case.

Zhang's style name was Zhiqing, and he was from Fanshi, Henan. He was born seven years before the founding of the Republic of China. He lost his mother at the age of three and was diligent and self-motivated from a young age, with a unique and profound spirit, harboring great ambitions. At the age of nineteen, he graduated from the Fourth Normal School of Henan Province and taught at the Fanshi County Higher Primary School. At that time, the domestic revolutionary atmosphere was strong, and Zhang was influenced by political ideas and devoted himself to the revolution and nation-building. He particularly admired Dr. Sun Yat-sen's political ideas and joined the Kuomintang in the sixteenth year. When the Northern Expeditionary Army had just arrived in Wuhan, he sneaked into central Henan to secretly organize and train the people, and instigated them to respond. For a time, all localities followed suit. The military operations on the Pinghan Railway were thus able to advance rapidly. In the seventeenth year, he entered the Central Party Affairs School and worked hard to explore the principles of the revolution. When the Northern Expeditionary Army advanced to Shandong Province, the central government, in order to strengthen propaganda, sent Zhang to accompany the Ninth Army north, where he was exclusively responsible for propaganda work. When the army reached Jinan, the May 3rd Massacre occurred. Due to the diplomatic environment, he returned to Nanjing with the army to complete his studies at the Party School. At that time, in the Kaifeng local party affairs election, Zhang was elected as a standing committee member and engaged in party training work, devoting all his efforts and achieving great results. Later, feeling that various opinions were flying around and political theories were in turmoil, and that young people lacked leadership in their thinking, he transferred to the education sector of Henan Province. He successively taught at the Provincial No. 1 Middle School, the Provincial No. 1 Normal School, and Jingquan Middle School, and concurrently managed training. As a result, the youth of central China were deeply influenced by the Three Principles of the People.

Between the twenty-first and twenty-second years, the Japanese invasion of Chahar and Suiyuan was very urgent. Zhang went north to serve as the chief editor of the Northwest Public Opinion, engaging in cultural resistance against the enemy, with the goal of promoting national culture and awakening national consciousness. His righteous arguments were promoted, and the enemy was wary of him. In the twenty-fourth year, the Chahar Provincial Party Affairs Department was forced to withdraw, so he returned to the Central Party Headquarters, serving for ten years, taking on difficult and dangerous tasks, and making brilliant achievements. In the winter of the thirty-third year, the enemy forces in North China were still strong, and the war in the Central Plains suffered repeated setbacks. Zhang silently observed the crux of the problem, which was that the local people were not organized and trained well enough. Therefore, he resolutely requested to be transferred to local service, and in March of the thirty-fourth year, he took office as the Secretary-General of the Henan Provincial Party Headquarters. After taking office, he made plans and handled affairs in an orderly manner, and all abandoned tasks were resumed. There was also a harmonious and seamless relationship between comrades, reversing the chaotic situation of the past. As a result, the strength of the people rose, and the military and the people coordinated, and the power of resistance against the enemy in the Central Plains grew stronger and more vigorous day by day.

Since the victory, the military demobilization has been orderly, all based on the foundation laid by Zhang's deep organization and training of the people. The hatred of the enemy has become even more deeply ingrained. For more than a year, they have been thinking of taking revenge, and anonymous threatening letters have been sent more than once, but Zhang has ignored them all. However, the most recent letter has indeed succeeded in its treacherous scheme. Zhang devoted his entire life to struggle, was loyal to the party and loved the country, and his death was heavier than Mount Tai, so he had no regrets. However, Zhang was cut down in his prime, which is a loss to the country. Zhang did not engage in production during his lifetime. He is survived by his wife, Ms. Hou Songling, and his children, Zhenlong, Zhenlei, and Guan, who are orphans and helpless. His desolate aftermath is truly heartbreaking and evokes sympathy!

### The "Executive Relief Administration" in Turmoil

— Our Reporter, Pingzhai

(Continued from page 8)

Everyone makes "expedient" arrangements and "gets the moon first near the water tower." As a result, disaster victims in remote inland provinces such as Hunan, Henan, and Guangxi can only starve and wait forever. If transportation cannot be resolved, they will have even more opportunities to "wait."

More than two hundred foreign staff members of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) in China have pointed out that our country has a tendency to discriminate politically in its relief efforts. However, the smooth negotiations between the Executive Relief Administration and Zhou Enlai can prove that this accusation is clearly quite far from the truth. However, can these unpleasant things be prevented from happening again in the future? I think that every person who cares about the Executive Relief Administration and UNRRA probably wouldn't dare to say definitively, "There will be no more problems from now on."

Humans are political animals, and no one can avoid having some biases. There are as many as twenty-two different nationalities among the staff of the UNRRA office in China. Some of them are scholars, experts, soldiers, and many are "old Shanghai" and "China hands" from the Shanghai Municipal Council during the concession era. People have different backgrounds, so their thoughts will naturally be different. The friction between Jews and non-Jews is quite intense, and the "sectionalism" is indeed deep-seated. The fact that the relationship between Orme-Sands and Reiss cannot be harmonious is also well-known. This matter is probably not unrelated to La Guardia's rage. As a result, a shipping ban was imposed on China, which "harmed" the innocent "fish in the pond." It can be seen that under the current situation, it is impossible for the "guest ministers" to "separate themselves from politics," and it does not seem likely that they will achieve "one heart and one mind." If Zhou Enlai's request to send people to participate in all departments of the Executive Relief Administration is actually realized, then the political atmosphere inside the "Executive Relief Administration" will probably be the most intense among all agencies in China.

"The Executive Relief Administration is a sinking ship, but we must do it well." A senior official in the Executive Relief Administration told me this.

In light of the current situation, it is impossible not to feel the greatest concern for the Executive Relief Administration. Whether this "ship" will "sink" is still uncertain, but time is too short, and there are indeed too many shocking waves!

The people in charge are all first-class talents. Mr. Jiang Tingfu not only has foresight but also has the courage to negotiate with the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to the best of his ability. Mr. Liu Hongsheng, who is responsible for implementation, is also a "veteran" who has experienced various storms in various businesses, and he does things without delay. The general cadres can also be said to be above average, with several very capable and energetic talents.

The plans are also quite complete and are quite practical.

If the Executive Relief Administration fails, the reasons for this failure are worth our deep consideration. When we discuss the Executive Relief Administration, we certainly cannot separate it from China's politics. If politics does not get on track, but we insist that the Executive Relief Administration succeed alone, this is like carving a boat to find a bird, and there is little hope of success. The nature of the work of the Executive Relief Administration requires the closest cooperation with various ministries and commissions. Take transportation as an example. The current difficulties in the transportation of materials are mostly due to political reasons, but there are many cases where transportation has not been smooth, but not because someone is sabotaging it. For example, why have the Jinggui National Highway and the Yuehan Railway not been properly repaired even after a year of victory? In terms of finance, the Executive Yuan has not given the Executive Relief Administration much help. The four hundred and thirty-two billion yuan of post-war relief funds allocated by the government is a substantial amount, but although this budget was created by the Executive Relief Administration, the Executive Yuan has already allocated this money to the Ministry of Transportation, the Water Conservancy Commission, and other ministries and commissions. As a result, the agency that created the budget has not received a single penny! Recently, although they have spent a great deal of effort to obtain 80 billion, how many percent of the original budget does this 80 billion account for? Speaking of selling supplies, the Executive Relief Administration had agreed with the Executive Yuan on how much to sell before determining the amount of relief to request. However, when selling, the Executive Yuan often borrowed money on its own and sold the same supplies on the market. As a result, either the goods were oversupplied and no one cared about them, or the Executive Relief Administration had to wait for the Executive Yuan to finish selling before selling its own. Even so, the sale of supplies has played a very large and decisive role in curbing inflation. However, it is really difficult for the Executive Relief Administration to exert the highest degree of efficiency under these circumstances.

Speaking of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, which supplies the materials, it is certainly very commendable that these forty-odd friendly countries are willing to embrace the drowning person's heart and help our country, but there are still situations where they "promise verbally but do not deliver practically." The things that they promised to give you often only amount to thirty or fifty percent, and sometimes they suddenly stop for two or three months before coming again. Sometimes they send things that you don't need, but they don't have what you need most urgently. China's post-war relief has very detailed and complete plans, but their relief does not match these plans. Large machines that are completely unsuitable for China are piled up in warehouses in Shanghai, and as a result, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration issued an order to stop shipping materials, saying that the warehouses were being cleared too slowly!

Recently, the flames of war have risen again in the country, and staff members of the Henan branch of the Executive Relief Administration have been killed or injured, making it even more difficult to advance the work. In fact, the need for post-war relief is even more urgent. Time waits for no one. How many more months will it take to get the materials? A very great ideal of President Roosevelt seems unlikely to be realized.

[Dr. Zhang Zhongming replies] (1) You can try Fibrolysin injections. (2) White precipitate ointment is ineffective. (3) There is no medicine that can make yellowish-brown skin whiter.

(2) Facial Milia

Mao Yufu asks: Three years ago, a small milium, about the size of a soybean, grew on my left cheek. It was similar in color to my skin and didn't cause any pain or itching, so I ignored it. Starting this year, it suddenly increased to thirty or forty particles, each about the size of a grain of rice, all flat and not pointed, about three sheets of paper thicker than the skin. Repeated treatments have been ineffective. Please advise on a radical cure.

[Dr. Zhang Zhongming replies] This is milium. It is advisable to use Trichioracetic acid or Silver Nitrate to corrode it.

(3) Bad Breath and Constipation

Yao Huilie asks: I have many red spots on my tongue, and my mouth often feels strange. My tongue coating is blood red, and it recedes slightly when I am hungry. My appetite is sometimes good and sometimes bad, and my facial muscles are getting thinner day by day. My bowel movements are not smooth, and I cannot fall back to sleep after waking up at night. Please advise on treatment methods.

[Dr. Zhang Zhongming replies] You must first examine your stool to determine the treatment method.

### Service Briefs

Looking for Documents: I took streetcar No. 17 at 3 PM on August 18th, and due to carelessness, I lost a paper package on the streetcar. The package contained a diploma from the Zhejiang Private Prison School, as well as five letters of appointment from the Xuzhou Army Prison and the Jiangxi and Anhui Higher Courts. These documents are useless to others, but they are quite troublesome for me. If anyone finds them, please send them to No. 6 Jingde Lane, Tangzhan Road, and there will be a reward, or call 41901, and I will personally come to your residence to receive them. Xiong Suan

Claiming Lost Items: Yesterday, I returned to Shanghai from Qingning Temple in Pudong on the last city ferry. I saw a young man resembling a soldier carrying many pieces of luggage. He disembarked at Xiandu Wharf. Because there were many people crowded on the ferry and many passengers were getting off the boat on the shore, this person lost a piece of luggage. When the boat returned to the Shanghai port, I handed it over to the military police at the waterfront hotel for safekeeping, waiting to be claimed after it was reported in the newspaper. If the loser sees the report, please go to the military police detachment there to inquire. Fei Zhiye respectfully

### Shanghai's Lingering Summer

— Pingzhai

The Beginning of Autumn has passed for several days, and although the summer heat has not yet dissipated, Shanghai's first summer after the victory has finally come to an end. Last summer, the people of Shanghai were listening to the piercing air raid sirens with infinite excitement and tension. When the heavy engine sound came, they quietly listened to the direction of the bombing and counted the number of bombs. Sometimes the glass windows were shattered by the blast of the bombs, and one or two pieces of shrapnel jumped into the bedroom. However, there was no resentment in everyone's hearts. On the contrary, everyone was looking forward to the counterattack that was about to come!

After the first Allied aircraft bombed the Shanghai suburban airport, the enemy puppet newspapers published small special editions about a foot square, which were plastered all over the telephone poles. The enemy's intention may have been to arouse the resentment of the Shanghai people, but what many Chinese people who remained in Shanghai said to this special edition was, "As long as we win, I don't mind being bombed to death!"

Victory has been achieved. The Gujiazhai Park, which was a restricted area last year, is packed with tourists this year. Hongkou—a place where no one dared to go last year—has many people enjoying a cool moment in the swimming pool this year. Shanghai is gradually awakening.

The summer of the 35th year of the Republic of China (1946) may still have a few things that are particularly worth remembering: The first is that there were heavy rainstorms this summer, and the roads became a country of lakes. The second is that Shanghai held a "Miss" and "Queen" competition this summer to raise money for disaster relief. I hope the roads will be repaired soon and there will be no more floods in the future. I hope the "ticket money" for electing Miss and Queen will soon be in the hands of the refugees and not just circulating in the hands of the handlers!

### "Garden Parties" were also particularly popular this summer.

### Heavy rainstorms this summer turned the roads into a country of lakes.

### A "Miss" and "Queen" competition was held for the refugees in northern Jiangsu.

### Relaxing in the swimming pool

### Fuxing Park—formerly Gujiazhai Park—is packed with tourists

### Hongkou swimming pool is crowded with people this summer.

### Young ladies are enjoying a happy summer in the park.

### Summer camps were also held in several places in Shanghai, and they are having an exciting time living in paradise.

Spring and Autumn

### Groans Under the Shuttles (Fiction)

— Lian E

The weather in early autumn was extraordinarily stuffy, especially at noon, which was even more unbearable! Looking up at the sky, it was covered with dense, dark clouds, and everyone knew that a sudden rain would fall immediately.

The "Echo" chime for the twelve o'clock lunch break had just sounded. The cement chimney of the ×× cloth factory, standing tall on Xiaoshadu Road in western Shanghai, was emitting thick smoke, curling upwards towards the dark clouds in the sky, rising in clumps, rising, and then blending into the cloud layer.

A dozen female workers hurried out of the factory, all saying in unison, "Ah! What to do? I didn't bring my overshoes and umbrella!" As they spoke, they ran together into the dining hall.

At this time, the dining hall was already crowded, and everyone was scrambling to get to the hot water tap to make rice porridge. The hot water taps were really unreliable. Although there were more than a dozen in a row, the water coming out of only the first two or three taps was satisfactory. The rest were pitifully small, and the last two were practically like a sick woman's breast milk, impossible to squeeze out.

Xiuying was a new worker who had just started, so she had to let the older workers go first in everything, but she was really anxious in her heart: she couldn't weave less cloth today. The stern face of the foreman, Sister Wang, appeared before her eyes again. She really resented that the yarn had broken so many times in the past two days. Even worse, she kept encountering "flying shuttles," and calling the mechanic to fix them took up even more time. Now she saw that her companions had already eaten and gone into the factory, while her rice porridge was not even made. Anxious, she simply didn't wait. She ate some cold rice haphazardly and walked towards the factory.

The rain did fall heavily as everyone had expected, and it was getting heavier and heavier. It hadn't stopped by five o'clock, and every worker was worried about the road home. Only Xiuying was worried that she had woven even less cloth than yesterday. How would she explain it to the foreman later? And the mechanic kept coming around to offer his services, talking nonsense, which was really annoying!

The mechanic was a local tyrant in the factory, and no one dared to offend him. Even Sister Wang had to give him some respect, and the "little rice buckets" (Note 1) didn't dare to provoke him either.

Xiuying had no choice but to humor him. When he learned that Xiuying was afraid of being fired by the female foreman for weaving too little cloth, he assured Xiuying that he could speak to Sister Wang for her.

In the end, Xiuying managed to have a smooth week thanks to the mechanic's intercession.

Mechanical civilization, on the one hand, has brought material enjoyment to people, but on the other hand, it has brought more misfortune to people. However, those as unfortunate as Xiuying, after working a week of day shifts, were now about to work night shifts.

Working the night shift was also a full twelve hours of work. Except for ten minutes or so for eating at midnight, the female workers tending the machines (Note 2) were not allowed to be lazy for even a minute.

Xiuying was naturally no exception.

The misting machine sprayed water mist non-stop, and the factory was full of man-made fog. The grating noise of over two hundred looms was about to shatter people's eardrums. Xiuying focused all her attention on watching the shuttle moving back and forth in the warp threads.

Now, because of her relationship with the mechanic, Sister Wang had assigned her two looms. It was a great honor for a new worker whose skills were not yet fully proficient to be assigned to manage two looms at the same time. Because their wages were calculated based on the amount of cloth woven, managing two looms meant they could weave more cloth, of course, but it also meant they would be much busier than managing one loom.

Factory owners were most concerned about the productivity of the machines, so even though the female workers were "living on their own," if the amount they wove did not meet the standard, they would still be interfered with - fines, cancellation of bonuses, dismissal... were all stipulated in the factory regulations.

Although Xiuying was very happy to be managing two looms, she was also very scared. She thought that after she received her wages, she could buy a bottle of cod liver oil for her father. For several years, her father had been teaching in a private middle school, which was really too strenuous and didn't earn much money.

All-day labor and all-night coughing had left him as thin as a rail, and his lung disease was about to enter the third stage. But for the sake of livelihood, he was still working hard.

Although her mother was only in her forties, she was as worn out as an old woman in her sixties. Her body was too weak to work for long periods, but she forced herself not to rest all day long. In fact, she really couldn't afford to rest!

Her younger brother was studying in junior high school, and he and her father had to come home for meals. Her younger sister was too young to help, and her mother had to take care of everything.

But when she thought about the time wasted frequently stopping to join broken threads, she couldn't help but worry.

Evil seems to be inseparable from the darkness, and many evils in the city occur in the night. Even in another corner of the city, evil is growing.

Just as Xiuying was joining a thread, the mechanic quietly slipped behind her and whispered to her:

"Come to my house tomorrow at three o'clock!"

"No, my mom doesn't allow me to go out."

"Just say the factory has a meeting tomorrow."

"No, I want to sleep!"

"There's a bed in my house too!"

"..."

The next night, Xiuying was still weaving cloth, but her heart was still uneasy. The mechanic's fierce gaze kept flashing before her eyes.

Suddenly, the loom stopped. Xiuying hurriedly tried to turn on the switch, but no matter how she turned it, it didn't work. She knew there was something wrong and had to find the mechanic to fix it. The mechanic came, first removing the machine wheel and slowly wiping it with a cloth... After half an hour, Xiuying really couldn't wait any longer. She asked the mechanic how long it would take to fix it, and the mechanic replied:

"Can you come out at twelve o'clock tomorrow? I can fix it right away, otherwise, I'm afraid it won't be fixed tonight!"

"Um!"

"Shall we go to the Great World tomorrow?"

"..."

Mechanical life is as repetitive as can be. Every day, joining threads, removing cloth, putting on yarn... every day it's always the same thing. Xiuying had gotten used to these things. Tonight, because she had spent half the day playing with the mechanic, she couldn't hold on any longer by two o'clock in the middle of the night. Her eyes just wanted to close, and she yawned incessantly.

The mechanic also knew that Xiuying couldn't hold on. Now, seeing her sleepy and drowsy, he ran over to her and said:

"Go to the locker room and get some sleep! I can borrow some cloth from other female workers for you tomorrow morning."

Xiuying really couldn't resist the invasion of sleep, so she nodded in agreement.

The locker room was where the female workers changed clothes when they came to work and left work. Except when it was particularly lively during "shift changes," it was always locked the rest of the time. The key was kept by the foreman, and no one else could enter it casually.

Now, because of the mechanic's connection, Xiuying was able to openly "skim oil" (Note 3).

When Xiuying woke up bleary-eyed, she felt a surge of heat coursing through her body. She wanted to struggle, but she didn't have the strength. She could only let herself be trampled and slaughtered until he was satisfied.

She wanted to cry out, but she didn't dare. She thought her life was over. Thinking of this, she cried, very, very softly. She was afraid of being laughed at if she was heard, so after sobbing for a while, she wiped away her tears, straightened her hair, and walked out of the locker room. In the alley between the machines, she met Sister Wang, and her face flushed as she lowered her head and quickly walked to her machine. Although she had avoided Sister Wang's gaze, she could see very clearly the pair of eyes that clearly contained jealousy and helplessness. So she understood even more in her heart, but what use was there in understanding?

Half a month later, the weather was still very stuffy. Xiuying was still very busy weaving cloth. The grating noise of the machines continued unchanged, and the misting machine was still spraying rain-like mist. Everything seemed very calm and very regular.

Heaven seemed to specialize in bullying the easy targets. In this calm and regular atmosphere, a commotion suddenly arose. Everyone stopped their machines and looked towards Xiuying's loom. They saw Xiuying's face covered in blood, and she had fainted on the ground. It turned out that a shuttle had flown off one of the looms next to Xiuying. This shuttle, with its sharp iron tips at both ends, had been shot out by the "picker stick" (Note 4), and it had hit Xiuying right in the temple, knocking her unconscious in pain.

When Xiuying woke up, she was already lying in the ×× Labor Hospital. The hospital was quiet, with no miscellaneous sounds, but Xiuying's mind was still filled with the annoying sound of the machines!

She only felt that her head was about to be shattered by the sound, so she experienced bursts of excruciating pain. So she groaned in pain.

But the groans under the shuttles are weak. Only those with the same fate as Xiuying can hear such weak groans clearly. So now Xiuying's painful groans can only be experienced quietly by herself.

Note 1: Little rice buckets - A common term used behind the backs of young staff in textile factories.

Note 2: Tending machines - The general term for looms, tending looms refers to managing looms.

Note 3: Skim oil - Stealing sleep while working the night shift is called skimming oil.

Note 4: Picker stick - A wooden stick made of sandalwood, with a hard leather piece on top, used to strike the shuttle. There are two on each loom, left and right.

### An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng

"Tired...? It's not like you're a city girl." He felt slightly insulted after all. "Even if you add three more like this, wouldn't you still have to walk, Uncle?" His voice still had the shrillness of a child, but his demeanor was so old-fashioned.

Regarding food, no matter what he ate, refined or coarse, and regardless of the time, as long as he was given a little, he welcomed it all and ate quite a lot. Although he was skinny for a twelve or thirteen-year-old, he was five feet two or three inches tall, only an inch or two shorter than me. According to common saying, he was in his "growth spurt," so he couldn't gain weight, but he could eat.

After a while, after making some miscellaneous arrangements over the phone, I put on my official handgun and went to the front room. Little Tiger was still eating. As soon as he saw me enter the room, knowing that it was time to leave, he left his seat and said goodbye to the comrades in the room, calling them Uncle and Big Brother. He also grabbed a small cloth bag on the table. It looked like a bag of snacks that the Uncles and Big Brothers had prepared for him.

"Which road did you come from just now?" As soon as we left the courtyard, I wanted to know some information about the situation on the road. At this time, there was a cannon blast roughly every two or three minutes in the east and northeast, mixed with some heavy machine-gun fire. The northwest was relatively calm, but there was also gunfire. These were all precautionary postures, not formal engagements.

"Come this way," he pointed to the northwest corner, "I took several detours, taking small paths." His steps were still so light.

I hadn't taken this road in the northwest corner. I heard that it would cross Lugou Bridge, skirt around several small mountains, pass through Tiancun, Bali Village, and enter the city through Xizhimen or Guang'anmen. Even without detours, it would be seventy or eighty li.

"Uncle, would you like to see some excitement?" Little Tiger slowed down and turned his head to look at me.

"Good boy, don't we have important business today?... "I knew what his little mind was up to, "There will be plenty of opportunities to see excitement later."

"Then, we have to cross this small ridge, take the small path over there, and head to Xibianmen--but you won't see a single ghost."

"Okay, as long as we get close, fast, and have no trouble, it's even better if we don't see a ghost..." Seeing that he had politely started to argue, I had no choice but to encourage him with a sentence, "Look, when we have free time one day, can't you and I go find the Japanese devils and make some trouble?"

He smiled happily. "Uncle, you really 'have guts.'... Grandpa, the grandpa in the village, also really has guts. In less than ten days and a half, he's going to fight a guerrilla battle. You know, the Japanese devils eat a lot of stuff." He raised the bag of snacks in his hand and swallowed a mouthful of saliva. "They don't eat this stuff. They eat bread, canned beef, rice balls... We have to loot a big pile of it every time, and also guns, rifles, and stuff."

Hearing him mention the mountain village, I was reminded of this child's legendary story:

"How old are you this year?"

"Tiger, thirteen... Aunt Ji calculated for me, saying it can only be counted as twelve years old, I'm also not sure." Aunt Ji was Ji Yaoqun.

"I heard that you're pretty good at what you practice...?"

"It's nothing... Bagua sparring, hitting the post, Yang Palm, Dharma Gong, grappling hands, and I haven't practiced Qigong well yet."

"How many years have you been practicing?"

"Fourteen years, Uncle."

"How can that be?" Even if you count thirteen years old, you can't have practiced for fourteen years.

"How is that?" He didn't understand what I meant, tilting his head, his big round eyes blank.

"Ten years or four years...? It can't be fourteen years, right."

"My grandpa said so; that is, Master Ma, who taught me to practice Kung Fu--he's seventy or eighty years old this year."

### Snippets on Poetry

— Stedi

Part Two

Poetry is the most beautiful rhythm of emotion, the sublimation of language, and the best artistic technique of written expression.

The expression of emotion is not limited to writing and language; musicians weave their hearts into musical scores, allowing nerves to pulsate among soaring musical notes. Painters mix life into oil paints, capture fleeting moments, and preserve elusive light for eternity. Art includes literature, literature is the art of language, and poetry is the language of literature. Thus, poetry is the same as all art, possessing the conditions that art must possess, processed through special artistic methods, and expressed.

Poetry must be "beautiful." Beauty is not strangeness, dazzling clouds only give people momentary dazzle. Beauty is not ornate, magnificent palaces only lock up a house of dullness. The value of "beauty" lies in eternity, and it must maintain immortal brilliance. The meaning of "beauty" focuses on essence, not merely belonging to the realm of form. "Beauty" must be "true." The formation of mirages is merely a reflection of real things. "Truth" is built on "reality." The "truth" of poetry is to reflect the face of reality through the poet's subjective image onto the truth of the poem. Therefore, "true" poetry must have the backbone of life. "Beauty" must be "good." The progress of history is the victory of the struggle between "good" and "evil." The ideal of beauty is arranged in front, and people must pursue it through the path of suffering. "Good" indicates the inevitable direction. Therefore, "good" poetry must step to the same rhythm as the progress of history. The "beauty" of poetry is not only the beauty of words, rhythm, language, and form, but also includes the beauty of "truth" and "goodness" in essence. Poetry should be the cry of the awakened soul of a prophet, full of lofty and great hope, showing the paradise of human life ideals. Poetry must sing of pain, making a powerful appeal for those oppressed under opposing forces and social environments. Poetry must sing of battle, revealing the progress and liberation of human history. "Beauty" cannot be without conditions, and "beauty" cannot be without a price. I do not object to pure natural beauty, but in the path of human life, "beauty" is the ultimate goal of struggle. Poets must use awakened souls and sublime emotions to blend reality and create a harmonious melody of "beauty."

Poetry is the most refined image language in literature. A piece of rough pig iron, after a thousand forges and a thousand hammerings, can achieve tough steel. Language is ore, which must be washed in rapids. A thousand loads of iron sand cannot wash out several loads of pure sand. To create a true sculpture of real emotions and desires, one must pick the most refined language, refine and discard the dross, preserve all the essence, rich life emotions, powerful musical rhythms, magnificent painting colors, and strong ideological concepts. The composition of dross is complex, but everything is useless. The quality of essence is subtle, but it encompasses all value. The refinement of poetry must contain infinite meaning.

Poetry is not painting, and painting is not poetry. The ancients had a saying, "There is painting in poetry, and there is poetry in painting." The former illustrates the expressive beauty of poetry, and the latter illustrates the emotional beauty of painting. After all, poetry and painting have significant differences due to the different tools of expression. Poetry is not prose, and prose is not poetry. The form and structure of poetry often carry a strong prosaic quality. The description and imagery of prose also have a rich poetic rhythm. Poetry and prose cannot be clearly demarcated due to their mutual tools. Poetry is not music, and music is not poetry, but poetry must be a sonata played by reality's fingers plucking the strings of the soul; it contains the harmony of sounds, the rhythm of emotions, the melody of meanings, and the tone of lyricism. The expression of art has an unbounded commonality, and poetry, in the department of language art—literature, is relatively more direct and lifelike language.

### Reading "The Tempest"

— By George Gissing, Translated by Ma Yufeng

Today I read "The Tempest," perhaps my most beloved play. Because I consider myself to already understand it well, I usually only skim through it without truly reading it. But this is often the case with Shakespeare; if I read him again, I feel my knowledge is incomplete, more so than I imagined. This will be the case no matter how long one lives. It will always be so as long as one has the strength to turn the pages and the mood to read it.

I like to believe this was the poet's last work, written in his home in Stratford, as he walked daily in the fields that taught him to love the English countryside in his youth. This is the ripe fruit born of the highest imagination, a perfect masterpiece in the hands of a master. Because Shakespeare's skillful and free use of language surpasses all the achievements of other great men, what pleasure can compare to it for those who dedicate their lives to the study of English? I can imagine that he felt this power particularly in "The Tempest," as inimitable and appropriate words, and phrases of unparalleled rhythm, whispered to him from the mouth of his guardian spirit Ariel (Translator's Note: This is the spirit in the play). He wrote, smiling to himself. His language seems to play, amusing itself by discovering new methods. People of every class, from emperors to beggars, and people of every mental state, speak through his mouth. He has told the legends of fairyland, and now he creates something that is neither human nor spirit, but something between beast and man, endowing it with language for its purpose. How those languages contain the fragrance of the fertile wetlands and the life of creatures that cannot rise to the surface! We don't think about it enough. Because our appreciation is lacking, we limit our amazement. Although miracles unfold before us, we hardly notice them. Like other mysteries of nature, our hearts have become accustomed.

"The Tempest" contains the most sublime meditative sentences in all of drama, sentences that are the expression of Shakespeare's final worldview, articles that cannot be omitted by those who wish to summarize philosophical teachings. It also contains his most beautiful lyric poems, his most tender love words, and a vision of fairyland that surpasses even the highest beauty of "A Midsummer Night's Dream"—I cannot help but think this. Like Prospero's farewell to "hills, brooks, calm lakes, and elves of the shady groves," these are also miracles. These sentences are read a hundred times without becoming tiresome. Every time you read them, they are always fresh, as if just created from the poet's mind. Because it is a seamless work, there is no feeling of boredom from discovering flaws. It is never possible to fully absorb its advantages, and then feel a lack of stimulation when flipping through it next time.

Among the many reasons I find it joyful to be born in England, the first should be that I read Shakespeare in the language of my ancestors. If I imagine that I cannot know him directly, only hear him speak from afar, only use a language learned through diligent intellect to come into contact with his vibrant soul, a coldness of disappointment and a feeling of desolate loss would befall me. I often think I can read Homer, and in fact, if there is anyone who likes him, it is me. But can I immediately dream that Homer will convey all his joy to me? And is his language the same to me as it was to people strolling by the sea in the glorious age of Greece? I know that, passing through the great river of time, what I get is only a weak, broken echo. And I know that this is a glorious sight of the ancient world, and it is even weaker if it is not mixed with the memories of youth. Let every country have its poet and find joy, because the poet is the country, is all the country's greatness and beauty, is the inalienable heritage of all people's birthplaces. Closing the book, I am dominated by love and admiration. Is it my whole heart that is poured out to this great magician? Or has he placed his spell on this island nation? I do not know. I cannot examine these two things separately. Awakened by the "voice of voices" (Translator's Note: A line from Shakespeare's poetry), in love and admiration, Shakespeare and England have become one.

### Ramblings Under a Dim Lamp

— Shao Fu

The Central Bank has allocated 13,000 gold bars in four days, which, at 2.15 million yuan per bar, amounts to 27.95 billion yuan. This is no small sum.

The financial authorities issued a warning early on, saying that they are tightening credit and everyone should be careful to avoid slipping and falling all over the place.

The Eighth is just around the corner, and it will be too late to "hang yourself" by then. I would like to remind the friends who are "somersaulting" again.

Minister of Food Xu Kan said:

This year's harvests across the country are unprecedented in the last 20 years. The UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has 200,000 tons, and we have ordered another 80,000 tons. Supply exceeds demand, so how can rice prices rise?

The work of the reception and investigation team probably won't be finished for a while, because cases of corruption and fraud are being uncovered continuously. The weather is so hot, and the committee members are busy all day with headaches and dizziness. We really feel bad about that.

Could all those who have committed fraud and corruption come forward and report themselves!

Zhang Dinghe's concert, Dai Ailian's dance performance, the Experimental Theatre's "Spring Cold," and the China Electric's "Loyalty and Righteousness Family" are the best (music, dance, drama, film) artistic activities in Shanghai in August. Giving up one is a loss.

### Reservation Fees and Receipts: Strange Things at the School

— Tian Feng

Yesterday, I found a receipt for a reservation fee in Xiaoming's schoolbag, which reminded me of the story behind this receipt.

Xiaoming came home three or four days before the end of the semester exam last semester and said: "The headmaster told us that the school is about to close. If you still want to come here to study next semester, you must pay a reservation fee of 1,500 yuan this semester; otherwise, your place will be cancelled." In order to keep Xiaoming's place, I gave him 1,500 yuan and told him to pay it to the headmaster. After dinner, Xiaoming took the 1,500 yuan and happily went to school. At five o'clock, Xiaoming came back hopping with his schoolbag on his back. He put down his schoolbag, rummaged around in it, and took out a small packet of paper. I thought it was a receipt for the reservation fee, but when I opened it, to my surprise, it was still two bills of legal tender worth 1,500 yuan. So I asked Xiaoming why he didn't pay the reservation fee. Without thinking, Xiaoming said spiritedly, "The class teacher told us not to pay. He said this is to be paid into the headmaster's pocket. If the headmaster gives a receipt for the reservation fee, then you can pay it. If he doesn't give a receipt, don't pay it. As a result, the headmaster said there was no receipt, so I didn't pay and brought it back."

I felt very strange when I heard Xiaoming's words. I thought the reservation fee was to reserve a student's place and should be deducted from the tuition fee for the next semester. Why should it be paid into the headmaster's pocket? I was truly baffled. I waited until Saturday, thinking that today was the last day for Xiaoming's school to pay the reservation fee. I gave Xiaoming another 1,500 yuan and told him to pay the reservation fee. Xiaoming took the 1,500 yuan and went, but he still didn't pay. So I asked Xiaoming if his grades were bad this semester and he would have to repeat a grade, so he didn't pay the reservation fee and wanted to go to another school? Xiaoming repeatedly said no. I was very puzzled, so on Sunday morning I went to visit Xiaoming's class teacher. This teacher is a good friend of mine, and he told me the story of the reservation fee:

This headmaster spends all day making money. This time, in order to fill his own pockets and please the teachers, the headmaster came up with the idea of collecting reservation fees from students in the name of "teacher appreciation money." On the one hand, he distributed some to the teachers, and on the other hand, he didn't give receipts. However, the teachers were unwilling to be used by the headmaster, so they told the students not to pay the reservation fee unless there was a receipt.

So that's how it is. I understand.

### Cold

— Ye Huimin

Scientific Common Sense

"Cold"—regarded as a hazard to human life just a few years ago—is now used to save lives. During this war, ice anesthesia, commonly known as "paralysis surgery," was invented. It not only numbs but also causes no pain, requires no additional medication, and does not cause bleeding.

Cold air reduces the vitality of human life. When a part of the body's temperature is lowered to near freezing, the cells and bacteria inside temporarily stop activity.

In the past, when soldiers were wounded on the battlefield, they often used tourniquets to inject oxygen into the organ on time. Each time the tourniquet leaked a lot of blood and caused toxins to enter the body. With freezing, there is no need for the trouble of a tourniquet. Because the cells in the body are not active at that time and do not need oxygen, the soldiers can absorb the toxins and avoid pain, and they can have the hope of recovery when they enter the hospital. However, it is impossible to obtain freezing surgery on the front lines, so an electric refrigerator about the size of a radio was invented and powered by the motor of an ambulance, which is very convenient to use.

The freezing surgery used today was invented by Dr. Frederick M. Allen, a professor at New York Medical College. Many hopeless conditions have been saved by this surgery. As an example, an eighty-three-year-old patient had gangrene in one leg. Putting this leg in the refrigerator for an hour not only gave him a new life, but also caused no pain, nausea, or feelings of collapse.

Since Professor Allen invented freezing surgery, it has been able to reduce the mortality rate of diabetes or gangrene by as much as 75 percent.

Soon, new instruments for freezing surgery in therapeutics will be produced, and Professor Allen has also hinted that there may be a new method to replace the one currently used. Applying cold, cruel air to the ulcerated part will cause the bacteria in that part to be absorbed and shrink to a minimum, and then gradually recover.

Freezing also shines in the field of medical skin grafting. The U.S. Army Medical Corps is now using this method: cutting a piece of skin from a patient to repair the rotten skin—this surgery used to require anesthesia, and the old surgery was inferior.

Although it is too early to say that medicine has entered the ice age, it has already revealed a ray of dawn, encouraging new discoveries in this corner.

A: The exchange rate has gone up. Let's buy more American goods!

B: What? Isn't the purpose of increasing the exchange rate to encourage everyone to buy domestic goods?

A: Because domestic goods have already gone up in price, most American goods haven't risen much yet. Let's buy some more while we can.

B: I see. No wonder the American goods business has been even better these days.

### Youth Paradise

— Yu Jian

The Lushan Summer Camp, which closed yesterday

Scenes from the China Youth Lushan Summer Camp

Lushan's popularity is certainly due to the peaceful negotiations and the coming and going of important people. However, what has formed its special prosperity is the Youth Corps' Summer Camp and the Jiangxi Province's Summer Lecture Series.

The Summer Lecture Series is the older brother, and the Summer Camp is the younger brother. This is a tacit understanding on both sides. However, the older brother is far behind the younger brother in every aspect. Whether in material or spiritual terms, the older brother can only shake his head and sigh in inferiority. The Summer Camp is full of young men, eating three meat dishes, two vegetable dishes, and a soup with steamed buns. They live in six-story buildings and wear khaki uniforms. What's more, there are theater-style lecture halls, palace-like libraries, and clubhouse-like Chiang Kai-shek Halls. In addition, there are several movie, Peking opera, and entertainment performances every week. Under the guidance of nearly thirty male and female physical education instructors, they play ball, swim, do calisthenics, and do whatever they want. What is even more worthy of pride is that the chairman always comes to visit several times a week, and the lecturers are at least ministers of departments and institutes. This makes the older brothers in the Summer Lecture Series, who live in small houses on Dalin Road and chew on coarse tea and light meals, sigh in envy.

At the end of Hedong Road is the location of the Summer Camp. In the morning, it is quiet, and only the loudspeakers in the auditorium broadcast the different tones of the lecturers. In the afternoon, the athletic field unfolds a picture of health and beauty. Male students with bare chests and female students with bare arms, not one of them is not lively and energetically moving their limbs.

In the evening, when the sunset is like thick rouge painted red on the horizon, don't sneak into that deep forest alone, otherwise the pairs of lovers snuggling together will surely sting your heart. You might as well turn around and sit on the stone railing of the small bridge, listening to the bursts of singing coming from afar, which will give you a feeling of infinite coolness and let you close your eyes and fall into a dream of reminiscence.

Summer has gone, and the Summer Camp has also closed, but no one who has stayed at the Summer Camp can forget this pleasant memory!

### "American Mooncakes"

— Wei Qin

Today I walked past a confectionery store on North Sichuan Road and saw an advertisement boldly proclaiming "American Guangdong Mooncakes," which made me speechless.

Someone said: "This is not surprising. Since the moon is already better in America, then of course the mooncakes are also better in America. It is a pity that the American moon cannot be moved to China. Otherwise, eating American mooncakes and enjoying the American moon to make a complete scene would be great, wouldn't it? But I don't know what the word Guangdong means. I should reserve my judgment and wait for further research."

### The Camera and Truman

— Yu Qiang

Famous People's Anecdotes

Since taking office on April 12, 1944, U.S. President Truman has been photographed about 300 times a month, more than anyone in history.

The late President Roosevelt understood the importance of photography very well. Photos can show his personality to millions of people, enhance or weaken his position among the people, and make him a symbol in the minds of the nation. So today Truman relies especially on the lens.

Thus, President Truman, like a Hollywood star, always maintains the best posture in front of the camera.

Eighty years ago, President Lincoln frankly said that campaign photos helped him enter the White House. Of the 120 Lincoln photos that exist today, only three can be used as national portraits.

Later, photographic technology improved, and the late President Roosevelt benefited a lot. However, in the 1920s, news films were not yet widely circulated to express the true personality of the president.

President Wilson, of the World War I era, was the first U.S. president to have his speech in theaters photographed.

President Hoover and President Coolidge, who preceded the late President Roosevelt, were not photogenic. They were both awkward, excited, and almost timid in front of the camera, so they could not take advantage of this opportunity. Coolidge probably took 2,100 photos during his presidency, and Hoover probably 1,500.

Now, President Truman understands more, and "camera reporters" often stay in the White House.

### Social Experience in Front of the Dentist

— Zhi Wei

This is what I heard from a worldly friend:

If your tooth hurts so much that you can't sleep and you have to consult a dentist, you should first understand how your savior values you.

When you see a dentist and tell him you're going to trouble him, you must endure the pain you showed last night lying in bed unable to sleep, and nonchalantly say to him:

"Doctor, please take a look. Do I need to have this tooth pulled? If the procedure is inconvenient, I think I'll just let it go!"

In this way, you will save a lot of money invisibly; because the dentist's scale of valuation is based on the pain you feel; the greater the pain you express, the better the opportunity for him to rip you off.

### What's So Strange?

— Si Shui

What's so strange about the tram driver not stopping at the station? He can drive and can stop; naturally he can not stop. The right to stop and start is in his hands. Why can't he use it as he pleases? May I ask: In China today, how many people do not use their rights as they please?

What's so strange about the tram ticket seller skimming? A friend put it well: "The one who doesn't skim when money passes through his hands is a dog!" Compared with those shocking corruptions and non-shocking corruptions (the non-shocking ones are because people don't know about them), the tram ticket seller's skimming is really negligible. And it has nothing to do with the national treasury at all. Isn't it worthy of praise?

What's so strange about passengers rushing to get on the bus, disregarding order? If you can't squeeze on, you can only blame God for making you so incompetent. What's the use of scolding others for not keeping order? If you really can't squeeze on, there is a secret that can be taught to you, which is: take a rickshaw! If you can't squeeze on and can't afford a rickshaw, then please close your eyes and think carefully: what are you still living for in this world?

Passengers who haven't boarded the bus are quite disciplined; once they get on the bus, their attitude changes completely. What's so strange about this? Do you still remember that old classmate of yours? How touching were his remarks about improving social customs in the beginning? And after he was honorably appointed as ×× Chief, do you know where those garden villas of his came from?

The tram company has to reduce the number of vehicles due to the assertive people. This is indeed a bit strange. "If you want to sit, I just won't let you sit!" In this way, hasn't the tram company become one of the assertive people? What's more, those assertive people don't decrease because the number of vehicles decreases. Unless they don't drive a single vehicle, they always have a car to sit in; it's just that those who could sit in several cars have squeezed into one. And what about those who are squeezed out? Naturally, they are the non-assertive people! Plant beans and get melons? Isn't that strange?

### Heartstrings

— Yu Gang

There are people who like to mow lawns in winter and sweep snow in summer.

Divorce is democratic bankruptcy between two people.

If you want to see a colorful rainbow, you must wait for the rainstorm to pass.

Love wears out time, and time wears out love.

Saying nothing is often the most expressive form of speech.

If you make things people need, you can make a living; if you make things people want, you can get rich.

The so-called salary is something that you can't live with or without.
