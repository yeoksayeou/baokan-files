### National Army in Northern Jiangsu Closes in on Baoying; Marches South Along the Grand Canal, Crossing Jinghe Town; Main Force of Communist Army in Dongtai Retreats North Late at Night

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 25th] Since the National Army shifted to defensive counterattacks, successively recovering Huaiyin and Anhou, the morale of the Communist army has plummeted, resulting in successive retreats. The National Army marching south along the Grand Canal has already crossed the heavily guarded Jinghe, closing in on Huangpu. (Huangpu is only twenty Chinese miles from Baoying city). Furthermore, in order to reverse its declining situation in northern Jiangsu and attempt a final struggle with the National Army in Shaobo, the Communist army has been actively preparing for war in recent days. On the 24th, a regiment of the Communist army arrived in Shaobo from Gaoyou, including 300 Japanese prisoners of war.

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 25th] The northward retreat of the main force of the Communist army in Dongtai is conducted secretively. The retreat time is always late at night, moving north along the Xiaoshi Path east of the Fangong Dike, using red and yellow lanterns as signals.

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 25th] A certain military observer told reporters that if the Communist army in northern Jiangsu does not retreat early, there is a risk of complete annihilation. As the National Army gradually advances, the only retreat route for the Communist army is the East China Sea. Today's frontline news indicates that the National Army in Huaiyin continues to advance towards Lianshui from Yugou.

[Our Jiangyin Dispatch, 24th] More than a thousand Communist troops advanced from Lijia Bridge to invade Xinqiao Town. Because they encountered no resistance, they rushed into the city, destroying houses and arresting people. The garrison troops in Pingchao were dispatched and the Communist troops fled to Wujie Bridge. Another dispatch reports that Ji Fang, the deputy chairman of the Communist Party's Jiangsu-Anhui Border Region government, secretly came to Haimen from Huaiyin. Due to the military setbacks in northern Jiangsu, he will divide the Communist army in Qidong into smaller units, lurking in the countryside to carry out sabotage.

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 25th] As the war situation in northern Jiangsu unfolds, refugees from Funing, Lianshui, and Baoying counties are heading to Suqian and Huaiyin, waiting to return home. Relief work in Huaiyin and Huai'an has begun actively. The Jiangsu-Nanjing Relief Branch sent personnel with large sums of money and supplies to Huaiyin on the 25th.

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 25th] After the recovery of Huaiyin and Huai'an in northern Jiangsu, social order is now gradually being restored. The "Anti-Japanese Currency" has been banned, and current market transactions are maintained through barter. The Jiangsu Provincial Government has allocated 200 million yuan for the needs of the Huaiyin and Huai'an markets. The Jiangsu-Nanjing Branch also allocated 3,000 bags of flour on the 25th to be transported to help the affected victims.

### Order Restored in Eastern Suiyuan; National Army Enters Chahar from Northern Hebei; New Deployment Adopting a Gradual Advance

[Our Guisui Dispatch, 24th] Order has been restored in eastern Suiyuan. Scattered Communist troops are being suppressed by the local militia and troops.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 25th] It is reported that the National Army on the PingSui Railway is acting quite cautiously and has a new deployment targeting the Communist army's pocket warfare tactics. They are cautiously avoiding deep penetrations by isolated forces, adopting a gradual advance. The Hebei-Chahar border may take the PingSui Railway as its center, with simultaneous actions on both flanks. Lingyuan on the Chahar-Rehe border, two districts were recently recovered by local teams residing there, and it is not that the National Army has advanced to that location. The National Army that recovered eastern Suiyuan and He County may head straight to Chaigou Fort via Zhang Bi-tong's Jia Yingzi.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 25th] Confirmed reports indicate that two more divisions arrived at the front line of the Hebei-Chahar border last night. As of today, the National Army has completed its deployment.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 25th] Official sources say that the Communist army has completely destroyed the railway east of Huailai, and heavy troops are now concentrated in Huailai, Yanqing, and the Duolun area. There are no battles yet, but the Communist troops from Rehe are gathering near Duolun to reorganize and prepare to strengthen the defenses of Zhangjiakou.

[Reuters, Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] Communist spokesman Liao Chengzhi said today that the National Army has begun a cautious advance towards Zhangjiakou, progressing eight miles each day. Recent dispatches from Beiping say that the National Army on the PingSui Line is advancing towards Huailai, fifty-two miles southeast of Zhangjiakou, while Fu Zuoyi's troops southwest of Zhangjiakou have also crossed the Great Wall. The Communist army is rushing to build defenses between Huailai and Xuanhua, and in the Huai'an area.

[United Press, Beiping Dispatch, 25th] The National Army is advancing towards Zhangjiakou from northern Hebei and has entered Chahar territory. The National Army Headquarters neither confirms nor denies the claim that the battle for Zhangjiakou is already underway. However, military sources say that the National Army is now attacking from Rehe, Suiyuan, and Hebei, encircling the Communist army's forward base of Zhangjiakou. According to news from the National Army: The National Army advancing north along the PingSui Railway from Beiping has left Nankou Pass and is stationed in Kangzhuang. The Communist army in that area has retreated to Huailai, building strong defensive fortifications. Military leaders say that Huailai is the gateway to Zhangjiakou and that a decisive battle will take place there.

[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 25th] After being defeated by the National Army in Datong, Nie Rongzhen's Communist troops retreated towards Yanggao. Fu Zuoyi's and Ma Zhanshan's troops are following in pursuit and have closed in on Yanggao. Fierce fighting may break out again in that area.

### Communist Army in Harbin Busily Preparing for War on the Banks of the Songhua River

U.S. Military Withdraws from the Beining Railway Zone

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 25th] Various signs indicate that military action is imminent on the banks of the Songhua River. The Communist army has now destroyed the railway between Taolai Zhao and Shuangcheng and has placed explosives on the Songhua River Bridge, preparing to destroy it at any time. Scrap iron, rails, and sleepers south of Harbin are also being transported to Suihua and Qiqihar. In addition, various transportation facilities at the Xin Zhan Railway Station north of Lafa have also been destroyed. All sleepers and steel bars have been removed, and the large water tower and nearby power poles have also been destroyed, causing water supply disruptions. The Communist army seems to be trying to prevent the National Army near Lafa from advancing towards Harbin along the Labin Railway.

[United Press, Beiping Dispatch, 24th] Authoritative sources here reported tonight: Because the National Army is taking Harbin as its main target, launching a sudden attack on the Northeast seems imminent. The U.S. Marine Corps is now withdrawing from various strongholds between Tianjin and Qinhuangdao, including the Tangshan Great Coal Mine area operated by the British. According to well-informed sources: The withdrawal of the U.S. Marine Corps has already begun and has been accelerated in recent days. The main purpose is to avoid another Anping incident. Once the National Army attacks the Northeast, the Communist army will inevitably attack this vulnerable section of the PingSui Railway.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang Dispatch, 25th] Near Xiuyan, a man named Song, deeply hating the atrocities of the Communist army, gathered more than 10,000 people in the mountainous areas of the county to confront the Communist army. Furthermore, many people in areas south of Gaiping participated, organizing their troops into small groups of three to five people each, lurking in various places to attack the Communist army, which is quite popular with the local people.

### National Army Advancing North in Northern Henan Only 20 Miles from Cixian

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 25th] A telephone call from Baoding reports that the National Army advancing north along the Pinghan Railway from Anyang in northern Henan has broken through the Communist army's defense line on the north bank of the Hebei. The vanguard troops are twenty kilometers from Cixian. Fierce fighting is still taking place in the Shuangmiao area of the Liuhegou mining area. The Communist army has transferred Communist troops from southern Hebei to reinforce them overnight. Liu Bocheng's chief of staff, Li Yi, is personally commanding the front.

[Central News Agency, Beiping Dispatch, 25th] The main force of the Communist army in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway has collapsed and is now divided into smaller units, attempting to destroy transportation in sections and cut off the National Army's connections. About ten thousand Communist troops from the Communist army in southern Hebei recently fled from northern Hebei near Gao Beidian and Zhier Huangfu, carrying a large amount of demolition equipment.

### Communist Army Aircraft in Northeast Packed and Shipped to Yantai

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 25th] Official news: The Communist army in the Northeast has recently packed a batch of aircraft and shipped them to Yantai.

### Minister Peng Discusses the Overall Situation; Deeply Believes a Solution Will Be Found; Scope of the War Is Not as Broad as Communist Propaganda Claims

[United Press, Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] Minister of Propaganda Peng Xuepei received foreign journalists on the 25th. One asked if he thought the overall situation in China was "hopeless." He replied, "There is hope. I am quite optimistic." When asked to explain in detail, Peng said, "You will see it. Tomorrow's events are difficult to predict, but I deeply believe that we will find a way to solve this problem." Peng also issued a written statement saying: "What the government seeks is peace, true peace, lasting peace, not temporary peace. Based on past experience, we know that the ceasefire order has been used by the Chinese Communists to consolidate their strength and attack again. In the past, the Chinese Communists requested peace whenever they were weak, using this time to regroup and redeploy. When they were strong, they attacked. After the issuance of the comprehensive ceasefire order in January, the Communist army occupied Changchun in June. After the second ceasefire order was issued, they attacked Dezhou, besieged Jinan and Qingdao, and even attacked Taixing, causing the war in northern Jiangsu, and the siege of Datong, which led to the war in Chahar. All of this shows that unless the Chinese Communists abide by the agreement on the reorganization plan of the army and determine the areas where the Communist army is stationed, the ceasefire is only a temporary peace, suitable for the benefit of the Chinese Communists. However, if these fundamental conditions are fulfilled immediately, then lasting peace is within reach." Regarding the war situation, Peng said that the scope of the war is far less extensive than the Communist propaganda claims. "In fact, except for the area around Chahar, the war in other areas has ended. There is no war in the area around southern Shandong and the Longhai Railway and the northeastern part of Hebei Province. There is only a mopping-up operation in northern Jiangsu. The Communist army has breached dikes in many places in northern Jiangsu, which has hindered the arrival of Communist reinforcements and hindered the retreat of the defeated Communist army. Many Communist troops trapped in these flooded areas have been captured." Peng added that the three or four thousand Communist troops trapped in northern Jiangsu, or whether the government intends to occupy Zhangjiakou, Peng refused to give a clear and direct answer. It is said that the war is concentrated in the areas south of Zhangjiakou and north of Datong. The National Army will continue to consolidate its positions to prevent the possible counterattack by the Communist army on Datong.

### Administrative Affairs in Recovered Areas Will Be Handled by a Committee

[Reported by this newspaper] In order to handle various administrative affairs in the recovered areas, the government authorities will establish a Pacification Zone Administrative Affairs Committee in the near future, directly under the Executive Yuan. It is reported that Premier Song Ziwen and Minister Bai Chongxi will concurrently serve as chairman and vice-chairman.

### Robertson Returns to Beiping

The Executive Group Withdraws from Dangerous Areas

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] The U.S. representative of the Beiping Military Mediation Department, Robertson, came to Nanjing on the 24th to report to Ambassador Stuart. He continued to talk with Ambassador Stuart on the morning of the 25th and returned to Beiping by plane at 11:00 am.

[United Press, Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] Robertson said: The executive groups are now withdrawing from dangerous areas because they are clearly unable to stop the war. He also categorically denied that the Military Mediation Department had abandoned its mission. It is said that this action is only a redeployment, so that the executive groups can be sent to useful locations and avoid the groups encountering difficulties and still failing. "Regardless of how the two sides publicize it, the Chinese Communist and U.S. members of the Military Mediation Department are still working together with all their strength." People here generally believe that if the National Army continues to press towards Zhangjiakou, and it is obvious, then the Military Mediation Department will recall the Zhangjiakou group, the Rehe Chifeng group, and the Jiangsu Xuzhou group. They will leave the two places by plane on the 26th, which can confirm that the Communist army is still holding Chifeng.

### Revising the Taiwan-Shanghai Exchange Rate Is Deemed Unnecessary

[Reported by this newspaper] According to reliable sources: The Taiwan Provincial Administrative Office previously requested the government authorities to approve the revision of the Taiwan-Shanghai exchange rate to 1 Taiwan dollar for 40 legal tender yuan. Now, it has been instructed that Taiwan is one of the domestic provinces, and the value of the Taiwan dollar has absolutely nothing to do with this adjustment of the US exchange rate. There is no need to revise the exchange rate between the Taiwan dollar and the legal tender.

### We Have Organized a Committee to Handle the Japanese Compensation Issue

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] It is heard that we have organized a compensation committee to handle the Japanese compensation issue, with Weng Wenhao as the chairman and Peng Xuepei as the deputy. The heads of various ministries and commissions, fifteen people, serve as committee members. The committee recently held a meeting, and Weng and Peng also had lengthy discussions five days later.

### Chen Lifu Discusses Sino-Soviet Relations

Condemns the CCP for Breaking Faith and Destroying the Friendship Between the Two Countries

[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] Chen Lifu, Minister of the Central Organization Department, received reporters from this agency today and spoke freely about Sino-Soviet and KMT-CPC relations, saying: The Soviet Union has not aided the Chinese Communist Party, neither in the past nor in the present, nor will it in the future, with the exception of propaganda. The Soviet Union will not abandon its status as a friend of China and support an unwelcome small group. The CCP accuses the Kuomintang of being reactionary. In fact, there has never been any ill feeling between China and the Soviet Union. The CCP does not want this good relationship to exist, so it plans to spread rumors, cause misunderstandings, make the Soviet Union doubt China, and thus destroy Sino-Soviet relations. Whenever the CCP indicates that it is ready to obey the government, Sino-Soviet relations will be perfect. At this moment, the CCP claims that they are friends of the Soviet Union. In fact, they are creating anti-Soviet sentiments in China. China hopes to maintain good relations with all countries in the world, but the CCP is trying to undermine this good relationship with the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, to achieve their selfish purposes. They are not patriotic. My political enemies call me the leader of the Kuomintang reactionaries because I resolutely oppose reconciliation with the CCP. Everyone knows that as early as 1937, I took the lead in holding negotiations with the CCP, promoting the agreement to jointly resist Japan, abolishing the Chinese Soviet system, and recognizing Chairman Chiang's leadership. However, the CCP does not keep its promises. Whenever the military situation is unfavorable to the CCP, they demand a ceasefire. Their political strategy is only a cover for military action. The government still hopes to reach a solution through political means, but only when the CCP agrees to the nationalization of the army can a political solution take effect. The government is determined to implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and convene the National Assembly in order to return power to the people. It hopes that the CCP will participate in the National Assembly and reorganize the government. I hope that the government will set a deadline for the CCP to implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. If the deadline has passed and it has not been implemented, then they will bear the responsibility for the consequences. Chen finally refuted the three accusations made by the CCP against the Kuomintang: (1) The CCP claims that the Kuomintang is anti-Soviet. In fact, they themselves are undermining Sino-Soviet friendly relations. (2) The CCP claims that the Kuomintang is anti-communist. In fact, the Kuomintang has often tried to reconcile with the CCP, but at the same time hopes to respect the will of the people. (3) The CCP claims that the Kuomintang opposes democracy. In fact, the CCP has its own private army, making democracy impossible. In short, the government is still trying to use various methods to find a political solution.

### He Yingqin's Speech

The United Nations Security Council Has No Right to Intervene in the KMT-CPC Dispute

[United Press, New York Dispatch, 24th] General He Yingqin told reporters today: Establishing an international army under the jurisdiction of the United Nations is the only way to maintain world peace. General He said: Due to the modernization of transportation, the establishment of an international army is now more possible. When necessary, international troops can reach any point in the world in three or four days. General He expressed his support for the United States' control of atomic energy construction and said: A large number of uranium deposits have been discovered in China's Xinjiang Province. General He mentioned the recent military setbacks of the CCP and said: The CCP should now be wary, because they themselves and the whole world have discovered that the CCP is not as strong as ideal. General He said: The KMT-CPC dispute is an internal problem of China, and the United Nations Security Council has no right to intervene.

### U.S. Government Continues to Support Ambassador Stuart to Help Our Country Resolve Internal Disputes; Ambassador Stuart Will Visit Hangzhou on the Fourth of Next Month

[Central News Agency, Washington Dispatch, 25th, United Press] Well-informed U.S. sources reiterated that U.S. policy is still to support Special Envoy Marshall in his efforts to help resolve China's internal problems, but while Marshall says he is optimistic about success, official sources are not optimistic.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] Political negotiations have completely stalled on the 25th. Government representatives are also inactive. Ambassador Stuart and his private advisor, Fu Jingbo, went out for dinner in the evening and had not returned to the embassy by 9:30 pm. The ambassador is scheduled to visit Hangzhou on October 4th.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] U.S. Embassy Press Officer Connors said: Because Chairman Chiang has not returned to Nanjing and Zhou Enlai has gone to Shanghai, the "mediators" have no one to talk to, and there is nothing to report for the time being.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] Amidst the depressing news, a reporter visited an authoritative source and asked about his observations on the Three-Person Committee, the Five-Person Committee, and the current situation. The source said: The current Five-Person Committee was proposed by Ambassador Stuart after the Three-Person Committee created a stalemate. At that time, the Communist Party agreed to the convocation of the Five-Person Committee, but when the Five-Person Committee was about to convene, the Communist Party refused to participate again, and it is really difficult to measure its intentions. Regarding the issue of the convocation of the National Assembly, the reporter asked what if all parties refused to participate. The source said, if the Communist Party does not attend on the specified date, then even if the meeting is postponed, they will not participate. If this causes an irreparable situation, it is easy to understand who is responsible.

### The Country Is in Distress and the Scars Have Not Healed; Chairman Chiang Humbly Declines Birthday Celebrations; Visited Tungsten Mines on the Border of Jiangxi and Guangdong Yesterday

[Central News Agency, Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] October 31 of this year is the 60th birthday of Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the National Government and Director-General of the Kuomintang of China. Central and local figures have unanimously proposed to offer him a toast to celebrate his birthday to promote the grand ceremony, but the Chairman reaffirms that the country is in distress, the people's livelihood is miserable, and it is appropriate to diligently seek governance. He should not simply talk about formalities, and especially hopes that comrades in the party will understand this meaning and set an example for the whole country. The Central Executive Committee has issued an order to the whole party to comply with it. The original order is recorded as follows: "October 31 of this year is the 60th birthday of the Director-General, which is the year of rejuvenation. Wishing him boundless life is appropriate in terms of etiquette and affection, but the Director-General has repeatedly warned that it is not allowed to be held, because although the War of Resistance Against Japan has been won, nation-building is yet to be completed, and there are many thorns and the scars have not healed. We should concentrate our efforts to seek governance, and should not be wasteful and talk about formalities. Therefore, we hereby order all party departments to inform all comrades to understand this meaning, and not to make a show. At that time, in addition to sending a written congratulation, there is no need to hold any ceremony. If we can follow the Director-General's instructions in the past, and each of us will do our best to contribute our talents, so that constitutional government can be implemented as soon as possible, the country can prosper, and the people can be put at ease. To wish the leader birthday is the greatest wish."

[Agence France-Presse, London Dispatch, 25th] Mrs. Cripps, at the invitation of Madame Chiang, is scheduled to leave for China with her daughter Becky next week.

### U.S. Government Continues to Support Ambassador Stuart to Help Our Country Resolve Internal Disputes; Ambassador Stuart Will Visit Hangzhou on the Fourth of Next Month

### U.S. Military's Presence in China Assisted in Repatriating Japanese Nationals; Our Government Granted Permission; Vice Foreign Minister Liu Erroneously Claims It Did Not Cause International Friction

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] Vice Foreign Minister Liu, attended a press conference held by the Central Propaganda Department at 3:00 PM on the 25th, and issued the following statement regarding Soviet Representative Gromyko's proposal in the Security Council concerning the stationing of U.S. troops in China: "The U.S. Marine Corps is stationed in our country to assist in the repatriation of Japanese nationals. To date, more than two million Japanese have been repatriated. The U.S. military, as a member of the Allied forces in the China theater, has shouldered this important task. Their presence in our country has been permitted by our government. The number of U.S. troops stationed in China has been reduced to less than half of what it was a year ago, and it is continuing to decrease as its mission nears completion. We do not see how the temporary presence of U.S. troops in China would cause international friction."

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] Regarding Stalin's statement on the 23rd and Gromyko's proposal in the Security Council, which argued that the withdrawal of U.S. troops from China was necessary for maintaining world peace, this reporter visited relevant authorities on the 25th. According to their spokesperson, Chairman Stalin's statement was frank and sincere and believed to be beneficial to the future of world peace. Regarding the stationing of U.S. troops in China, both China and the U.S. have clarified its legal basis and dispelled various rumors. In fact, the U.S. military is gradually withdrawing from China as its mission concludes, and the timing of the complete withdrawal is only a matter of time. The spokesperson also stated that they had learned that the Security Council had rejected Gromyko's proposal.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] Mr. Connors, the press officer of the U.S. Embassy, stated on the 25th that the Soviet representative's criticism in the Security Council of the U.S. military's presence in China involved diplomatic issues, and any comments should be issued by Washington. The embassy had "no official statement" on the matter. Regarding the withdrawal of U.S. troops, Mr. Connors said that the U.S. military was gradually withdrawing from China, and the U.S. military facilities in Shanghai would be closed by the end of the month. In the future, only the U.S. military advisory group would remain in China, and that organization was staying at the invitation of the Chinese government. As for the Marine Corps, they were responsible for transportation and other work, which was different from the army.

[United Press, Nanjing, 25th] Chinese political figures said regarding Stalin's statement that the withdrawal of U.S. troops from China was necessary for maintaining world peace, and Soviet Representative Gromyko's attack on the U.S. military's presence in China at the United Nations Security Council, that the Soviet Union, with the peace talks in China at a hopeless deadlock and the Chinese Communists encountering major oppression on all fronts, had finally openly provided diplomatic support to the Chinese Communists, revealing its sharp edge. Foreign Ministry officials stated that the recent organized attacks by the Soviet Union on U.S. policy toward China, especially regarding the stationing of U.S. troops in China, were an inevitable development. The same sources also pointed out that Zhou Enlai's withdrawal from the Nanjing peace talks, the "Withdrawal from China Propaganda Week" in the United States, and the instigation by leftists to stop one-sided aid to the National Government and the withdrawal of U.S. troops from China, were all consistent with the Soviet Union's planned actions.

[Reuters, Nanjing, 25th] Following the Soviet representative to the Security Council raising the issue of the presence of U.S. troops in China, apart from the government feeling uneasy that the Soviet Union had unduly interfered in the rights of a sovereign state, there was no explosive reaction. The Soviet Embassy and the Chinese Communist delegation seemed unaware of the development. An official at the Soviet Embassy said that the Kremlin had not given any instructions to the embassy in China. Liao Chengzhi, a spokesperson for the Chinese Communists, said that the matter was quite important and had been telegraphed to Zhou Enlai in Shanghai. He did not intend to express any other opinions, only hoping that President Truman's declaration in December of last year and the Moscow declaration of the three powers could guarantee peace in the Far East. As for Marshal Ma's headquarters, there was still no response.

[United News, Nanjing, 25th] Central spokesperson Wang Bingnan hosted a press conference today, criticizing Soviet Representative Gromyko's remarks in the Security Council regarding the China issue. It was said that the remarks were intended to point out that the U.S. military's presence in China was no longer necessary because the U.S. military's mission in China had come to an end. Some people believe that Gromyko's remarks were the prelude to the Soviet Union's active involvement in Chinese affairs, to which Wang declined to comment. However, he said that Gromyko had his reasons for making such remarks and that the Chinese Communists had not considered bringing the China issue to the United Nations Security Council for resolution. (For more on the Security Council's discussion of the U.S. military in China, please see page 3.)

### Minister Yu Discusses Transportation Issues; Communist Sabotage is the Main Obstacle to Solutions; Xuzhou-Bian Section of Longhai Railway Reopened Yesterday

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] Minister of Transportation Yu told reporters tonight that all current transportation problems could be easily solved, but the most important factor was the sabotage by the Communists. Over one hundred kilometers of the Longhai Railway had been destroyed. After two weeks of repairs, the entire line was reopened on the 25th. The Zhengtai Railway was also able to reopen after a week of repairs. Therefore, if there was no sabotage by the Communist army and efforts were focused on construction, transportation problems could be easily improved.

[Our Newspaper, Gui Sui, 24th] The No. 430 five-arch bridge between Xin'anzhuang and Fengzhen on the Ping Sui Railway was struck by two locomotives and a section about one hundred meters wide was destroyed with explosives as the Communist army retreated. Su Jinin, the director of the western section of the Ping Sui Railway, arrived the day before yesterday and determined that it could not be repaired in the short term. He immediately decided to build a detour, which was completed in one day and night yesterday. Today, a test run was conducted, and tomorrow it will be possible to travel to Fengzhen. It is reported that there are also two damaged locomotive heads and more than twenty cars overturned on a large bridge between Fengzhen and Datong. Workers have been dispatched from Datong to clear the area. Shi Zhiren, a special commissioner of the Pingjin District, is scheduled to fly to Sui on the 26th to inspect and慰問 the workers who repaired the western section of Ping Sui.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 25th] The Pingjin Railway Administration has assembled a repair team at Nankou for several months, and repair materials are also fully prepared. As soon as the National Army advances, repairs to the Ping Sui Railway will begin. According to a person in charge of the administration, once the Ping Sui line is opened, the Ping Sui Western Section Management Office will be abolished and directly under the jurisdiction of the Pingjin Railway Administration. Also, it is reported that the Ping Gu Road has been repaired ten kilometers north from Miyun.

### Zhou Xuechang, Traitor, Tried in Nanjing; Admits "Virtuous Governance" was Wrong; Audience Shouts "Shoot Zhou Xuechang"

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] Zhou Xuechang, the traitorous mayor of the puppet capital, was tried in the second courtroom of the Capital High Court at 4:30 PM on the 25th, presided over by Judge Wang Hongquan. Due to the large number of audience members and disorder, the trial was temporarily moved to the first courtroom. When the courtroom was changed, someone shouted "Shoot Zhou Xuechang," but Zhou Xuechang remained calm. At 5:00 PM, Zhou Xuechang, wearing a gray robe, black satin casual shoes, and white socks, Zhou confessed: He was from Tianjin. He divorced his original wife in 1940, but the procedures were not completed. His second wife was Yang Xichen, whom he secretly met in prison after being the mayor of the puppet capital. When going from Chongqing to Shanghai, he originally intended to go to Hebei to fight guerrilla warfare, but he was arrested by Li Shiqun, a puppet agent. He was released after Zhou Fohai rescued him and joined the puppet organization. He said that Zhou Fohai dragged him into it and said: "I thought the government could be puppet, but the party and the people could not be puppet. Therefore, at the invitation of Zhou Fohai, I served as the deputy secretary-general of the Central Party Department, hoping to do some things that would benefit the people." He then explained that the existence of the East Asia League did not recruit members and did not work. As for the "virtuous governance," "requisition of labor," and "donation of scrap iron" during his tenure as a puppet mayor, he said that when the enemy and the puppets were in power, he used the powerlessness and courage of the puppet municipal government to resolve some "reconstruction" work caused by the enemy's coercion. As a result of his efforts, this type of situation did not occur again in the second half of his tenure as a puppet mayor. In addition, he explained that at the time, he thought that as long as it was "beneficial" and "contributing" to the people, he would do it, but now he knows that it was wrong. The judge announced that Zhou would be remanded in custody until the trial resumed at 5:00 PM on the 27th. Zhou Jian, 45 years old, graduated from Peking University. In 1939, he served as the head of Shaanxi Education. He was trained in the first session of the Party Training Class of the Central Training Corps. In the spring of 1940, he went to Shanghai and served as the deputy secretary-general of the puppet Central Party Department. In 1941, he was transferred to the puppet Nanjing mayor and echoed the enemy chieftain Lieutenant General Ishiwara Kanji, initiating the East Asia League Movement and advocating the fallacies of Sino-Japanese cooperation and economic cooperation. He also served as the secretary-general of the Nanjing Branch of the East Asia League Association. During his tenure as a puppet mayor, he collected scrap iron and food from the people to help the enemy and abused merchants and civilians.

Editorial

### International Situation and the Chinese People - Harriman Succeeds Wallace as U.S. Secretary of Commerce

Immediately following the Soviet representative's appeal to the United Nations Security Council regarding the situation in China, we see that Stalin, the Soviet leader, also spoke to a reporter from the London Times, stating that the rapid withdrawal of American troops from China is a necessary condition for maintaining peace, providing strong support to the Soviet representative's appearance at the United Nations Security Council. In addition to the part concerning China, Stalin also mentioned the general world situation, especially regarding the handling of defeated Germany and the atomic bomb issue, concluding that "there is no danger of war at present, and any country that wants to start one will certainly not succeed." After the publication of this statement, news reports indicate that it cleared the political air of anxiety in Paris, where the four foreign ministers were gathered. At the same time, former British Foreign Secretary Eden gave a speech in London, strongly urging Britain and the United States to re-engage with the Soviet Union, arguing that the current relations contain an imminent threat of war. Although this has a different purpose than Wallace's speech, it aims to encourage the major powers to increasingly narrow and fill the gap between them and the Soviet Union. The Soviet leader's publication of this statement at this time is of profound significance.

Since the Potsdam Conference, the relationship between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union has gradually shown signs of division. Subsequent developments on the European continent not only failed to heal the rift but, on the contrary, deepened it. Recently, as former British Foreign Secretary Eden stated, it has "contained an imminent threat of war." The consequences caused by Wallace's speech forced him to resign, marking a temporary failure of appeasement towards the Soviet Union. In this sense, Wallace's speech was used by the Kremlin as a probe to gauge the intentions of Britain, the United States, and even the rest of the world. At this time, the Kremlin had probably discerned the direction of the United States, so it had to seize an opportunity to change course with the wind, to prevent the global situation from truly becoming rigid to the point of rupture. Therefore, although British Foreign Secretary Eden believed that there was an "imminent threat of war," the Soviet leader directly stated that "there is no danger of war at present."

Stalin's remarks are undoubtedly a friendly gesture towards Western countries to promote peaceful cooperation between the Soviet Union and Western democracies. Given the current rise of "anti-Soviet" sentiment, Stalin's remarks are a wise move. However, when we see that Stalin's proposals include withdrawing American troops from China to maintain world peace and prohibiting the use of atomic bombs to deprive Western countries of a powerful weapon, his attempt to "reconcile" is also attached with conditions, which is that Western countries abandon their positions and stances, and then the Soviet Union may approach them. This is no different from a person holding a knife in one hand, forcing others to respect his opinion, while at the same time shouting, "You guys give up your knives first, and I'll be good to you."

Although this statement is a clever attempt, not everyone is necessarily foolish. Realpolitik is materialistic and also idealistic. After this World War, no one wants another war. In this situation, we have repeatedly pointed out that this gap between the Soviet Union and Western countries should be filled as soon as possible. Since the Soviet Union has made such a friendly gesture, it seems that the door to reconciliation and closer cooperation has been reopened. Breaking the silence of many months and seeking sincere coordination is not necessarily absolutely impossible. What we should pay attention to is whether the Western countries will choose "unconditional surrender" or "conditional compromise." Since Stalin's speech mentioned the situation in China, we must first express our firm opposition to another "Yalta"!

Regarding the withdrawal of American troops from China and the Soviet representative's accusations against the situation in China at the United Nations Security Council, this newspaper has already discussed them in yesterday's article. We must point out again: Gromyko's speech at the Security Council included the deceptive words "an appeal made by a group of prominent figures in China, urging the United States to stop interfering in China's internal affairs." The appeal of these "prominent figures in China" had to come from the mouth of the Soviet representative, which greatly questions the status and value of these "prominent figures in China" in the eyes of the Chinese people. These "prominent figures in China" in the Soviet representative are no different from the "upper-class Chinese" during the era when Western imperialism dominated China. Only with these figures has the situation in China been forcibly pulled into the scope of international issues. In today's emerging international situation, we want to appeal to all patriotic people in the country to prioritize the nation-state, express our legitimate opinions on national affairs, and especially express our legitimate views on the temporary presence of American troops in China at this time, so that the whole world knows whether the Chinese people can be manipulated.

### Harriman Succeeds Wallace as U.S. Secretary of Commerce

After the resignation of U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wallace, President Truman has appointed Ambassador to Britain Harriman as his successor. After receiving the appointment, Harriman gave a speech in London, saying: "I am very pleased to have the opportunity to join President Truman's cabinet as Secretary of Commerce. I was one of the most active members during the time of the late President Roosevelt and served as chairman of the Commerce Department's Douglas Advisory Committee, so I am familiar with the duties of the Commerce Department. At the same time, in the last six or seven years, I have represented the late President Roosevelt and President Truman, stationed in various countries overseas, and have been able to directly learn about the serious economic problems faced by the people of Europe and Asia. People of all countries have great expectations for the United States, hoping that the United States can provide assistance and leadership in morality. I personally fully support the foreign policy adopted by President Truman and Secretary of State Byrnes and am continuing to work hard in accordance with the noble principles and goals revealed by the late President Roosevelt. This is the road to peace." After hearing this, the doubts and speculations caused by Wallace's resignation can all be dispelled.

Wallace's speech in New York, involving foreign policy, caused a great uproar in the American political world. Although President Truman decisively made this storm tend to subside, in any case, the occurrence of such an unfortunate dispute at this time is regrettable for President Truman's government. Now, Truman's appointment of Harriman as Secretary of Commerce can be said to be the most suitable candidate in the United States. The rift in the US government caused by Wallace's resignation has also been repaired.

The world is asking the American government after Yeress's departure, "Is President Truman still adhering to the political path of the late President Roosevelt?" At the same time, the opposition attacked President Truman on the grounds of abandoning Roosevelt's policy. However, President Truman's appointment of a successor to Wallace is still a figure who can best understand Roosevelt's ideas, which is enough to prove that the current policy of the United States can still be regarded as a continuation of Roosevelt's policy. As Harriman said, the American government is still working hard to follow the path advocated by Roosevelt and continue to move towards peace.

After Wallace's resignation, some people thought that Wallace advocated "one world," while President Truman chose "one policy," which would create "two worlds" and move further towards a third world war. After careful study, this view can be known to be true in appearance but false in reality. The foreign policy adopted by the U.S. government today is still based on promoting international cooperation and jointly maintaining world peace and prosperity, and does not want to create a situation of confrontation between groups in the international community and cause a crisis of war. Moreover, in terms of the actual situation in the United States, although the United States was the protagonist in determining the outcome of this war, directly participating in the war with its vast manpower and material resources, the United States itself, because of its geographical relationship, has the Atlantic and Pacific oceans as its barriers, and has not become a battlefield of the war. The domestic industry has not only not suffered from the great war, but its production potential has expanded even more than before the war. Once the U.S. war industry returns to its peacetime state, all of its manufactured goods will be more than enough for its own use, and can be exported to foreign countries to meet the needs of other countries, so that the people of all countries after the war can share peace and prosperity with the United States. Therefore, Harriman said: "After the expansion of peacetime production in the United States, in addition to meeting the needs of the people at home, it can also be used as export goods to meet the needs of people in other countries. This is the main foundation for the United States to achieve prosperity and happiness at home. The main foundation for the United States to cooperate with other countries and continuously assist the people of all countries is here; the main foundation for the lasting peace that the people of all countries yearn for is also here."

The sole goal of U.S. foreign policy is to create world peace; and the most difficult problem for American politicians and diplomats is how to live in peace with the Soviet Union. In theory, everyone knows that if the powers after the war want to create world peace, they must rely on the full cooperation of the five major powers: China, the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France; and everyone also understands that creating peace is even more difficult than winning the war. The real peace cannot be realized unless the powers cooperate with the spirit of fighting shoulder to shoulder in wartime and sharing life and death. But in reality, how to eliminate the differences in thinking among the powers? How to reconcile the conflicts of interest among the powers? How to dispel the suspicion that is growing deeper and deeper due to mutual misunderstanding? These are all serious problems. Secretary Harriman has served as an envoy to Moscow and is very familiar with the political situation in the Soviet Union. In the future, he will definitely make contributions to the government's policy towards the Soviet Union. It is expected that economic interests will be one of the important determining factors in the evolution of international relations after the war. Therefore, the views of the head of the U.S. Department of Commerce also have considerable influence on the determination of its foreign policy.

"Article 20" Italy renounces all rights in its public concessions in Shanghai and Xiamen and agrees to hand over the management of each concession to the Chinese government.

### Security Council Rejects Soviet Proposal - Chinese Representative States that the Stationing of U.S. Troops in China Was Approved in Advance by the Chinese Government

[United States Information Service, Lake Success, 24th] The Soviet Union had proposed that the Security Council include on its agenda the issue of requiring all countries to report on their overseas troop deployments, but it was recently rejected by the United Nations Security Council by a vote of seven to two. France and Egypt abstained, and Poland supported the Soviet proposal. The Security Council then adjourned in its entirety. It is scheduled to reconvene this Thursday, at which time a closing ceremony will be held and the issue of reporting to the United Nations General Assembly will be considered. The Egyptian representative pointed out during the meeting that Egypt is currently negotiating with the British side on the withdrawal of British troops. If the negotiations fail, Egypt will resolutely appeal to the Security Council.

Chinese Representative Xia Jinlin claimed that the stationing of troops by the United Kingdom and the United States in various countries had been approved by the governments of those countries and should not be considered a threat to peace. The request made by the Soviet representative has no basis in the provisions of the United Nations Charter and will not cause international friction. As for the stationing of U.S. troops in China, it has been approved by the Chinese government, and the U.S. troops have the task of cooperating with the Chinese government. Moreover, the United States has never interfered in China's internal affairs. Once its mission is completed, the U.S. troops will leave China, and this matter should be decided by the Chinese and American governments themselves. The Polish representative supported the Soviet Union's request, saying that the Security Council should not deny any member state the right to express its opinions. The U.S. representative replied that his delegation's records showed that the United States was willing to discuss various proposals, the more the better, but he regretted that the Soviet Union had not followed the provisions of the Charter and raised this issue through the appropriate channels with the governments concerned. He continued that his country had nothing to hide and that the locations where U.S. troops were stationed could be learned from newspapers. The Soviet representative reiterated his previous accusations, saying that since the Security Council has the power to take measures to maintain world peace, it certainly has the power to gather information.

### Soviet People Greatly Relieved After Stalin Indicates National Policy

[Reuters, Moscow, 24th] After newspapers and radio stations announced Stalin's remarks, indicating that there was no real danger of war, the residents of Moscow felt relaxed and satisfied, and the fear of war was eliminated by Stalin's words. This morning, a large crowd waited at newspaper distribution stations for the announcement of early newspapers. After reading them, they all uttered a "good" and then turned away. Purchasers of newspapers lined up in long queues, waiting patiently, a situation that can be described as rare. The Soviet people have complete trust in Stalin. If Stalin says "there is no war," the people are convinced that there is no war. Recently, the Soviet people have felt uneasy about war, even using old superstitious ideas to prove the normality of their uneasy state. For example, a large number of mushrooms recently arrived in Moscow. An old saying goes, "A good mushroom harvest means war is inevitable," so the people were even more convinced that war would inevitably happen.

### U.S. Acting Secretary of State Says Stalin's Remarks Are Worth Pondering

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 24th] When Acting Secretary of State Clayton received reporters today, he was asked for his opinion on Soviet leader Stalin's remarks to a British reporter. Clayton replied that Stalin's statement that he did not believe there was a crisis of any new war and that the atomic bomb should be banned as a weapon was worth pondering and of great importance. In addition, regarding Soviet Representative Gromyko's statement at the Security Council that the presence of U.S. troops in China, Brazil, Iceland, and Panama had caused uneasiness in those countries, Clayton commented on this statement, saying that it was not in line with the facts and that the presence of U.S. troops in various countries had not caused uneasiness.

### Thorough Reorganization of U.S. Navy Personnel

Four Admirals Retire

[News from This Newspaper] San Francisco, 25th Broadcast: The United States announced today the most thorough reorganization of the naval command since the end of the war, with a total of four admirals retiring. When issuing this announcement, the Navy Department emphasized that this change was in line with the department's policy of rotating senior officers to enable them to continuously gain new experience. Vice Admiral Denfield replaced Admiral Towers as Commander of the Pacific Fleet and the Pacific Area. Vice Admiral Blandy, who was responsible for the atomic bomb tests, took over the Eighth Fleet, which is now part of the Atlantic Fleet. Rear Admiral Holloway, Deputy Chief of Naval Personnel Management, will take over as Superintendent of the Annapolis Naval Academy after Vice Admiral Fitch retires in January next year. Vice Admiral Cochrane, Chief of the Bureau of Ships, will become Chief of Materiel in November, succeeding Admiral Moreell, who announced his retirement last week. Vice Admiral Mills will take over Cochrane's former position. Rear Admiral Johnson, Deputy Chief of Naval Personnel Management, will take over as Chief of Publications after Vice Admiral Carpenter retires in November.

### British Cabinet to be Reorganized

[Agence France-Presse, London, 25th] The British cabinet will be reorganized next week. The only female cabinet member, Education Minister Wilkinson, will be reassigned to a lighter post or even retire completely due to health reasons. Army Minister Lawson will leave office for the same reason. The rumor that Commerce Minister Cripps will resign is considered groundless in political circles.

### Truman Announces Campaign Platform - Seeking Peace as the Basis - Warns the People Not to Ignore the Current Crisis - Wallace Returns to the Democratic Party Camp

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 24th] Thirty-nine Democratic candidates for Congressmen visited the White House today to meet with the party leader, President Truman, who delivered a speech on the spot, saying: The crisis we are currently encountering is the same as the one that existed before the Pearl Harbor incident. In fact, this crisis has existed since the end of World War II. This crisis will continue to exist until peace is achieved and peacetime production is restored. The Democratic Party's platform is to seek world peace and universal support for production plans. Apart from this, the United States has no other demands. If the platform drafted by the Democratic Party in 1944 were implemented, there would be no unemployment problem in the country. As for the Republican Party's platform, its drafters aim to obstruct congressional proceedings. The difficulties of the current situation are partly due to the obstructive tactics of these Republicans.

[News from This Newspaper] San Francisco, 25th Broadcast: After President Truman announced that Democratic members would seek world peace and increase production in the election this November, recently dismissed Commerce Secretary Wallace returned to the Democratic Party's camp today. It is reported that he has agreed to support "recommended" Democratic members in future elections, which will greatly help the Democratic Party win.

### Soviet Soldiers Seek Trouble with Guns in the American Sector of Berlin

[Reuters, Berlin, 24th] In the American sector of Berlin last night, American military police attempted to stop the movement of a German truck, but were blocked by five Soviet soldiers with guns. Shortly after, a joint American-Soviet patrol military police force passed by and fired a Thompson gun into the sky, and the Soviet soldiers fled. The Berlin Military Court announced that three Soviet soldiers had surrendered themselves and were temporarily held by the American authorities, while the other two escaped. It is reported that within the past week, dozens of Soviet officers and soldiers also threatened the American military police with guns, attempting to rob two suspected traitors.

### Korean Communist Party's Anti-American Conspiracy - U.S. Intercepts Official Documents

### World War III: Jews Will Unite Against Communism

Truman Issues Statement to Jews

[Our Own Dispatch] San Francisco, 25th - A broadcast from a secret radio station by the Stern Gang organization today stated: In the workers' war, Jews will unite against the British. This broadcast expressed sympathy for the Soviet Union.

[US Information Service, Washington, 24th] President Truman issued a special statement of congratulations for the Jewish New Year, September 26th, which stated in part: "As the United States and other Allied nations strive to lay the foundation for lasting world peace, we are pleased to celebrate the Jewish New Year. I extend my sincere congratulations to my fellow citizens of the Jewish faith. Only when all people, regardless of race, language, and religious belief, jointly strive for human rights, can the foundation for lasting world peace be laid. To achieve this goal, the peace conference is currently discussing various issues and formulating treaties to guarantee freedom of speech, assembly, and belief for all humanity. This freedom is a legacy of civilization for centuries, and we all have a responsibility to promote its glory."

### Indigenous Rebellion in Iran: Fierce Fighting in the South; Negotiations in Azerbaijan Postponed

[Agence France-Presse, Tehran, 24th] A rebellion has broken out in southern Iran and is still spreading. Government forces and rebels engaged in fierce fighting in the city of Kaserun this morning. (Kaserun is near Isfahan, the former capital of Iran.) Government forces in the Bushehr region were forced to retreat two kilometers. Reinforcements landed at various ports in the Persian Gulf this morning. A mechanized unit of the government forces is advancing towards Shiraz, but has not yet entered the city. It is reported that the city is relatively calm, but prices have gradually increased in recent days, and residents are deeply afraid of famine, so they gather in mosques to pray. Prime Minister Sultaneh spoke with Lurs of Khuzestan via radio today, stating that he is studying their demands and inviting rebel leaders to Tehran for a meeting to discuss all of their demands. The negotiations between the central government and representatives of Azerbaijan Province have been decided to be postponed.

[Associated Press, Tehran, 24th] Iranian indigenous rebels have occupied several villages in the Persian Gulf. Indigenous leaders suddenly sent a telegram to Prime Minister Sultaneh today, making certain demands. The Prime Minister announced that he would respond.

[Reuters, Tehran, 25th] Senior Iranian military officials denied that the city of Bushehr on the Persian Gulf coast has been occupied by the Qashqai tribe, and stated that rumors of the Azerbaijani democratic forces taking the opportunity to advance on the capital are also groundless. The spokesperson said that although the government has sent troops to Khuzestan, Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad, and Gorgan, the military strength in the capital is still sufficient to deal with any emergency.

[Reuters, Tehran, 24th] One hundred and seventy trucks carrying Iranian government troops, tanks, and aircraft departed for southern Iran to rescue the city of Shiraz, which is surrounded by tribes. Reliable sources say that the Qashqai tribe has about 20,000 people, with sophisticated weapons, including rifles, machine guns, and recoilless rifles. The situation in Tehran is calm, and people are confident that Prime Minister Sultaneh is capable of handling all crises. It is reported that various tribes in southern Iran have successively joined the Qashqai tribe.

### Inventor of the Tank, Swinton, Passes Away

[Reuters, London, 24th] Sir Ernest Swinton, the inventor of the tank, passed away at his home in Lincoln today at the age of seventy-one. The first tank was built in 1915, when he was an agricultural machinery expert. The Admiralty asked him to design a tractor to tow naval guns, and his "Mother of Tanks" was highly praised by the then First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill.

### Greek King to Depart Today, Leaving England to Return to His Homeland

[Our Own Dispatch] Paris, 25th - Broadcasting from London: Londoners believe that King George of Greece will fly to Malta on the "York" aircraft tomorrow morning or afternoon, and then transfer to a Greek minesweeper to return home. However, the King of Greece's personal intentions have not yet been confirmed by those around him.

It is also learned that the King will be accompanied on this trip by his Prime Minister, Konstantinos Tsaldaris, and several important members of his entourage.

### British Military Headquarters in Egypt to Relocate

[Agence France-Presse, Cairo, 24th] The British military headquarters in Egypt has moved from here to an area near Ismailia last week. The British Middle East Command will also move from here to the Suez Canal area before December of this year.

### Americans Lack Meat; Slaughterhouses Hoard Pigs and Sheep

[Associated Press, New York, 24th] The United States is experiencing the biggest meat shortage in history today. Cities across the country are suffering from a lack of meat. This is due to slaughterhouses hoarding pigs and sheep in anticipation of the Office of Price Administration raising price limits. The meat supply in September is only half of that in June. After the reduction in meat supply, approximately 15,000 workers in the canned meat industry have no work to do. Other industries such as leather, lard, and soap are also greatly affected.

### Overview of Japanese-German Behind-the-Scenes Diplomacy Before Germany Launched War Against Soviet Union

Revealed in the Notes of Former War Criminal Matsuoka

[Kaizosha, Tokyo, 25th] The defense for the Far East International Military Tribunal today requested that former German Ambassador to Japan, Ott, be brought to court for cross-examination, but the request was rejected by the presiding judge. The prosecution today continued to present various pieces of evidence, including records of conversations between Matsuoka and Stahmer, which stated: In September 1940, the German special envoy to Japan, Stahmer, along with Ambassador Ott, met with Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka and expressed: (1) Germany hopes that this war will not expand into a global war and does not want the United States to participate; (2) Germany does not request military assistance from Japan, but hopes to restrain the United States and prevent its participation in the war; (3) The only way to prevent war between Japan and the United States and between Germany and the United States is for Japan, Germany, and Italy to establish an understanding or agreement and demonstrate a firm attitude; (4) Germany recognizes and assists Japan's political leadership in East Asia; (5) Approaching the Soviet Union will be beneficial after the Japan-Germany-Italy agreement, and Germany is prepared to mediate the issues between Japan and the Soviet Union. In addition, on January 31, 1941, Ott sent an urgent telegram to the German Foreign Minister stating: Because the world situation is in a stalemate, the Japanese side is currently working to threaten the United States. Finally, the Shiratori and other action factions advocate defensive attacks on Singapore. This attack is indeed promising, but if it turns into a long-term economic war, it will be unfavorable to Japan.

[United Press, Tokyo, 25th] Defense attorney Cunningham said today: Since the end of the war, the Soviet Union's actions in the Far East have given Japanese major war criminals such as Tojo more opportunities to be released than at the end of the war. The events that have occurred since Japan's surrender at least prove that the fears of the Japanese are partly accurate and justified. He told a United Press reporter that the Soviet Union's activities in the Northeast, in fact, proved Japan's fear of Soviet aggression, which was closely related to the Japan-Germany-Italy alliance. In a section of his report entitled "The Soviet Union's Status as an International Criminal," he wrote, "How can we reconcile the judicial system of Moscow with the judicial system of democratic countries?"

### Egyptian Prime Minister Declares Support: India Should Be Free and United

[Our Own Dispatch] Paris, 25th - Broadcasting from New Delhi: Egyptian Prime Minister Sidky Pasha declared his support for a "free and united India." This statement has aroused great attention in New Delhi and among the Congress Party. It is believed here that the Egyptian Prime Minister's statement on a "united India" is tantamount to a formal condemnation of the partition of India. Sidky's views are of great importance in Islamic countries, and it is not yet known whether other Islamic countries also agree with this view. The Allied side is currently maintaining silence.

### Netherlands Sends Troops to the Dutch East Indies; People Strike in Opposition

[Agence France-Presse, Amsterdam, Netherlands, 24th] Workers here are opposing the government's dispatch of troops to the Dutch East Indies to suppress the revolutionary movement, and have launched a general strike. Streetcars, buses, railways, and port transportation in the city have all stopped. Printing factories have also stopped working. Police authorities have taken various precautions to prevent communist troublemaking.

### Global Labor Unrest Roundup

[Reuters, London, 24th] Two public utility workers in Amsterdam have launched a general strike to protest the Dutch army's opening of the Dutch East Indies. For the third time in seven months, an electricity strike has occurred in the United States, affecting steel factories and various industries in Pittsburgh and Bethlehem. Five thousand oil workers in Sarawak, Borneo, have also gone on strike in protest of the small amount of rice rations allocated to their families. Although customs officials in France have resumed work, the union still claims that it will strike again if the government does not keep its promises.

### The Riddle of the Middle East (Part Two)

— By Bartley Crum; Translated and Abridged by Wenhao

The Oil Problem

However, the oil problem cannot be ignored. More than 95% of the oil in the Middle East, whether already extracted or still in reserves, is in the hands of British and American corporations. But recently, the Soviet Union and Iran concluded an agreement to exploit oil in northern Iran, which will inevitably have a significant impact. Although the benefits that the British and Americans give to oil-producing countries are already greater than in the past, it is unheard of for a country like Russia to be willing to share the profits equally with the oil-owning country. This event will not only cause Arab countries and Iran to demand amendments to previous oil agreements with the British and American corporations, but may also affect other oil-producing countries in Asia, such as Indonesia.

Arab Nationalism

In order to maintain its position in the Middle East, Britain has recently been making overtures to Arabs and Muslims both within and outside the empire.

During the two world wars, a fiery spirit of nationalism swept into the hearts of many Arabs. The slogan of "political and geographical integration" became widespread. They first planned to merge a small number of countries, and finally to merge all Arab-speaking countries together. However, due to the complexity of their political and social backgrounds, Arabs have always hesitated about this alliance. In addition, there are many other obstacles, such as the League of Nations mandates granted to Britain and France, which include Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, and Iraq; the hostility between the Saudi royal family and the Hashemite royal family; the unwillingness of Lebanese Christians to join an Arab state; the Palestine problem; and the balance of power policy pursued by Britain in Arab countries, and so on.

Palestine

The British Mandate of Palestine remains a very difficult problem. The Anglo-American Special Committee has recommended the transfer of 100,000 Jews into it, but without allowing the Jews to establish a state there, which has caused both Arabs and Jews to oppose it. Shortly after the Arabs fiercely opposed it, President Truman praised the report. However, as Russian power emerges in West Asia, Britain is more likely to be resented by the Arabs. The Russians have always been unsympathetic to Jewish nationalism, so the Arabs are reaching out to them for help.

The Arab League

After the Arabs realized the impossibility of "political and geographical integration," they devoted themselves to efforts to unify the Arab world, and the result was the establishment of the Arab League, which is composed of many Arab countries and headquartered in Cairo. Initially, its main task was to prevent the expansion of Jewish nationalism and to keep Palestine absolutely under Arab control, but later its scope of work gradually expanded. Due to the consistency of foreign policy and cultural and economic ties, the cornerstone of Arab unity is gradually taking shape. This league may become a latent force of Islam, and its power has already expanded beyond the Arab world in the East. Britain is very friendly to this league, so Russia deeply fears that it will become a tool of Britain, although the league earnestly expresses that its purpose is only to protect the interests of the Arab world.

The Condition of the People

What is the condition of the people in the Middle East? During the war, most of their leaders stood on the sidelines, and the general standard of living was better than before the war because they could sell goods and labor to the warring countries. Now that the war is over, the general public deeply feels the pain of life again. But their eyes are focused on labor rights and social reform. Most intellectuals are focusing their efforts on overthrowing the conservative system. Communists and leftists are small in number, but well-organized and resolute in their attitude.

Although Americans mostly abhor British imperialism, they support British policies because they believe that Britain is their first line of defense.

The situation of most of the people in the Middle East is very dire. Although several modern agricultural and industrial designs are being studied to solve the livelihoods of the general public, these plans are usually in the hands of conservatives, and these conservatives are only concerned with their own interests, not the happiness of the general public.

Of course, the Russians are by no means unprepared. Like the British and Americans, they have active agents all over the Middle East. The power of the British and Americans rests on the bourgeoisie, while Russia excels at agitating the dissatisfaction of the general public.

There is an Arab proverb that says, "When the sea winds fight, the sailors benefit." If the blind forces of the Middle East finally erupt into war, we wonder whether the sailors, who symbolize humanity, will be able to survive this time. (The End)

### Sino-American Friendship Abounds: A Reception for Dependents of the US Military Advisory Group; Lizi Society Holds a Grand Welcome Event; The Two Madame Chiang Kai-Sheks Attend Together

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] Madame Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Mei-ling, rarely attends public banquets, especially in Shanghai. This is probably the first time that she and Mrs. Marshall have attended a reception together.

The enthusiasm of American women for Madame Chiang Kai-shek is no less than that of the Chinese themselves. At yesterday's grand reception held by the Lizi Society to welcome the members and dependents of the US Military Advisory Group in China, they had a rare opportunity to see Madame Chiang Kai-shek's elegant demeanor. It is not surprising that when reporters told several American ladies, "Madame Chiang Kai-shek will also be attending today's reception," they were extremely excited and immediately spread the word to everyone. An American military officer said, "I have been in China for two years and haven't seen her once. I really want to see her." Indeed, this welcome reception did not disappoint them. The two ladies smiled throughout the hour they were in attendance. Although our new friends feel unfamiliar with China in many ways, they fully expressed their harmonious and happy feelings at yesterday's reception. We firmly believe that the friendship between China and the United States will be further enhanced.

The first batch of American military dependents numbered more than one hundred. The Lizi Society has prepared nine reception centers for them. The Jin Shenfu Road 118, where yesterday's welcome reception was held, is the second reception center. This is a magnificent building with a beautiful and spacious garden, originally the residence of Shanghai "celebrity" Sheng Laosan. It was taken over by the municipal government in May of this year and prepared for the mayor to live in, but the mayor and his wife thought the house was too extravagant and did not want it, so it was handed over to the Lizi Society. After taking over, the Lizi Society slightly tidied it up and planned to reserve it for Marshal Marshall, but Marshal Marshall has not lived there to this day. Mrs. Marshall must have found this residence particularly interesting when she came to this residence for the first time yesterday. This house is now prepared for the dependents of several other senior generals. Although the reception centers of the Lizi Society are all very well-appointed, there are some differences, which can only be allocated according to rank.

Welcome Reception Begins

The welcome reception started at 3:00 p.m. To the sound of pleasant music, the elderly and young wives and children of the American military gradually walked into the building. Several young women from the YWCA helped to receive them and guide them to visit the upstairs and downstairs. Unfortunately, most of the antiques from the "Sheng Mansion" have been moved away, and some of the remaining small items are not particularly wonderful. However, the photographs of President Chiang Kai-shek and his wife hanging on the walls of the garden corridor attracted all the guests, and at the same time, admiring voices such as "She is so beautiful" were constantly heard.

When about a hundred guests had arrived, the "finding peanuts" program began. This was only allowed for the wives and children. After the command "Start" was given, the old, the young, the brightly dressed, the plainly dressed wives and young ladies, and the lively and innocent children all scattered on the lawn to grope for peanuts. After the "Stop" command was given, the judges checked the number of peanuts. As a result, Mrs. White won the first prize with one hundred and eighty-one peanuts. There were also three other prizes.

The snacks served to the guests at yesterday's tea party were all Chinese pastries, including water chestnut cake, egg tarts, candied lotus root, siu mai, and candied lotus seeds. The American wives who had never tasted these Chinese pastries were all interested in them.

The Two Ladies Arrive; Applause Breaks Out

At 4:30 p.m., Madame Chiang Kai-shek and Mrs. Marshall stepped into the garden amidst the eager waiting of everyone. After a round of enthusiastic applause, there was silence. Curious and admiring eyes were all focused on Madame Chiang Kai-shek, but Mrs. Marshall's Chinese cheongsam made of yellow-green silk with coffee-colored flowers immediately attracted everyone's attention again. The style of Mrs. Marshall's cheongsam was exactly the same as Madame Chiang Kai-shek's cheongsam made of black silk with red and green flowers. That was because they were both made by Madame Chiang Kai-shek's tailor. The only difference was that Madame Chiang Kai-shek wore a black and gray short velvet coat and black goatskin high heels, while Mrs. Marshall wore a short yellow wolf fur coat and yellow-green glass high heels. Reporters had long heard that Mrs. Marshall looked even more beautiful in Chinese cheongsam than in Western clothing, and upon seeing her, they indeed felt the same way.

After the two ladies sat down at the long table in the center, they were accompanied by Mrs. Gilan, Mrs. Bingke, Mrs. Mayor Wu, and several others.

Then, Director-General Huang Renlin walked to the microphone and delivered a speech, stating briefly that China is extremely grateful for the assistance of the American military in fighting alongside China. We have decided to do our best to welcome the American military dependents and make them comfortable and convenient. However, after the eight-year War of Resistance against Japan, China feels the lack of everything and is facing difficulties. If there are any shortcomings in the reception, we hope everyone will forgive us.

In addition to inviting the American guests to enjoy Chinese pastries, Director-General Huang also introduced Pan Yuzhen's technical performance. The guests all expressed great satisfaction, and the children especially clapped and cheered. An female member of the Pan family performed the plate spinning. She was particularly wonderful. After the performance, Madame Chiang Kai-shek specially summoned her to examine the stick used for spinning the plate and asked her to perform again on the tower. Unfortunately, that plate was not their own, so after trying twice, it still did not work. When Madame Chiang Kai-shek saw that the young lady's face was splashed with water due to the wind, she specially took a piece of paper and told her to "wipe her eyes." Xiao Pengfei's magic performance also won applause from the entire audience. That little friend was very familiar with this trick. When he saw them breaking the eggs and pouring them into a hat, he said, "A chicken will appear in a while." However, this time the magician did not conjure up a chicken, but a plate of noodles. After a while, when he saw the card tricks, he told the reporter again, "In a while, the cards will slowly shrink." Sure enough, he was right.

Impressions of Shanghai

At 5:30 p.m., the end of the reception was announced. The two Madame Chiangs walked into the reception room to wait for each guest to be formally introduced, shake hands, and say goodbye. Therefore, the guests walked along the way saying, "This is a very interesting gathering. We feel very happy."

Finally, let us listen to what our new friends think of China. After the reporter talked with several wives, they all said, "We like China very much." One Mrs. Gober said, "When we left the United States, my friends were very jealous of us because they also wanted to come." Another wife said, "I grew up in Washington, D.C., and have always thought that Washington, D.C. is the most crowded city, but I didn't expect Shanghai to be even more crowded than Washington, D.C." Most of the wives and young ladies were unable to express their impressions of Shanghai because they had only arrived a few days ago and had not had the opportunity to browse this metropolis. The new friends unanimously felt that the difficult thing was that they did not understand Chinese, and it was simply inexplicable to buy things. A fifteen-year-old young lady who was about to attend American school told the reporter very sincerely, "I must learn Chinese, at least so that it is easier to call a rickshaw."

There is no doubt that the arrival of the American wives and young ladies in Shanghai will attract everyone's attention, especially for their new 1946 fashion, but in fact they are already complaining endlessly. One wife told the reporter that there are very few banquets and social engagements in the United States now. Each person can only buy one pair of leather shoes. Before leaving, she repeatedly negotiated with the shoe store, saying that she was about to come to China and also because she was a regular customer, so they allowed her to buy an additional pair. They were already envious of yesterday's grand banquet!

### General Bludworth's Honor: Madame Chiang Kai-shek Bestows Medal on Behalf of the Chairman; Grand Ceremony at the Dongping Road Residence

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday afternoon at 7:00 PM, Madame Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Mei-ling, on behalf of Chairman Chiang, bestowed the Order of Blue Sky and White Sun with Grand Cordon upon General Bludworth, the leader of the Executive Headquarters of the Military Mediation Team, at the Dongping Road residence. Among those attending the medal presentation ceremony were Mrs. Marshall, Mrs. Bludworth, Lieutenant General Gillem and his wife, General Chennault, and Chief Secretary Huang Renlin. Madame Chiang stated that General Bludworth was about to leave China and return to the United States, so she was representing the Chairman to present the medal on this occasion, personally placing the grand medal around General Bludworth's neck and offering congratulations. After General Bludworth received the medal, Mrs. Bludworth stepped forward to kiss him in celebration, and the guests raised their glasses in congratulation. After the ceremony, Madame Chiang accompanied the guests to the private residence of H.H. Kung for a dinner party.

[Another Report] Madame Chiang is scheduled to return to Nanjing this afternoon with Mrs. Marshall and her entourage.

### British Pacific Fleet Commander-in-Chief, Admiral Power, Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon; Lands and Pays Respects to Mayor Wu, Commander Xuan, Etc.

### Two French Postal Ships to Arrive in Shanghai Next Month

### Flying Across the Pacific: Opening Two Air Routes; Starting Point Shanghai, End Point San Francisco; Sino-U.S. Authorities to Sign Agreement Soon

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Sino-U.S. authorities are about to sign an agreement to open trans-Pacific air routes between China and the United States. The routes will start in Shanghai and end in San Francisco, divided into north and south routes. The southern route will pass through Xian Island, Wake Island, Honolulu, and other places, operated by Central Air Transport Corporation. The northern route will pass through Japan and other Pacific islands, as well as Alaska, operated by China National Aviation Corporation.

Negotiations were initiated several months ago by the U.S. commercial aviation sector. Three companies, including Continental, Pan American, and Northwest, plan to establish round-the-world flights via Shanghai using Constellation aircraft and other four-engine aircraft. The U.S. State Department officially dispatched Colonel Powell as a representative to China to negotiate with the Chinese Ministry of Transportation. As a result of weeks of negotiations, the Ministry of Transportation has instructed Central and China National Aviation Corporation to formulate detailed plans for the two routes so that flights can begin as soon as the agreement is signed.

Currently, both Central and China National Aviation Corporation lack suitable aircraft for trans-Pacific flights. Central currently has only C46 and C47 small aircraft, which are not suitable for long-distance overwater flights, so it plans to purchase giant aircraft such as the Stratocruiser from the United States. China National Aviation Corporation has ordered C54 four-engine aircraft, which are expected to arrive soon.

### Police Officer Accused of Accepting Bribes and Stealing Fingerprint Cards: Incident Exposed, All Arrested, Prosecuted, and Trial Begins

[Our Newspaper's Report] In December of last year, a certain unit in Shanghai was recruiting members, and one of the requirements was that applicants must not have been subject to criminal penalties, otherwise they would not be allowed to apply. Chen Mingliang and Zhang Jinrong wanted to apply, but because they had committed crimes in the past, their fingerprints were on file with the police. They asked Shi Yunda to ask Wang Heshang (i.e., Wang Zhenting) to find a way to lobby the police to destroy the fingerprint cards. Through the introduction of Fang Maosheng, they met Yin Dunlu, an officer of the third section of the Criminal Police Division of the Municipal Police Bureau. Because Yin specialized in fingerprint identification, they asked him to find a way to steal the fingerprint cards of Chen Mingliang and Zhang Yurong and destroy them. At that time, it was agreed to pay 40,000 yuan in remuneration for each card. After Yin agreed, he stole the two fingerprint cards and handed them to Wang Heshang. The incident was discovered by the second section of the bureau's Criminal Investigation Division, and the case was solved. In addition, Zhang Shaoliang had committed more than 20 crimes in the past. After the victory, because he wanted to obtain a car driver's license, he also entrusted someone to steal his fingerprint card from the police bureau for a price of more than 300,000 yuan in counterfeit currency. The card was discovered by a plainclothes police officer while searching pedestrians' pockets and was taken back to the police bureau. Yin Dunlu, Shi Yunda, Chen Mingliang, Zhang Jinrong, and Zhang Shaoliang were transferred to the District Procuratorate for investigation and prosecution. The trial began at the District Court yesterday. Wang Heshang is still at large. After the court inquired, it ordered a postponement for further questioning.

### Zhu Boquan and Others to be Sentenced on the 30th: Huang Zhuan and Tang Deyun Each Sentenced to Imprisonment

[Our Newspaper's Report] Huang Zhuan, chairman of the former Shanghai Bamboo Industry Association, was found guilty of coercing colleagues to join the association and engaging in enemy support activities. Yesterday, the High Court sentenced him to one year and six months in prison and deprived him of his civil rights for two years. Tang Deyun, a former employee of the Wannuo Trading Company, was found guilty of being a traitor and sentenced to one year and three months in prison and deprived of his civil rights for one year. All property of the two convicts will be confiscated, except for the necessary living expenses for their families.

Zhu Boquan, a prominent figure in Shanghai's financial and business circles during the enemy and puppet period, was finalized by the High Court yesterday and will be sentenced on the 30th of this month. Zhu is currently 48 years old, from Guizhou province, and studied at New York University and Columbia University in the United States. After returning to China, he served as the deputy manager of the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, the manager of the Foreign Exchange Department, and the chief auditor of the Central Bank. After the puppet regime occupied the concessions, he served as the chairman of the puppet China Industrial Bank, the director of the puppet Jiaotong Bank, a member of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Advisory Committee, a councilor of the puppet Central Reserve Bank, a supervisor of the puppet Central Savings Association, and the chairman of the puppet Shanghai Real Estate Industry Association. In addition, he also served as the manager of the Silver and Money Industry Joint Reserve and presided over the clearing house to promote the puppet currency. He also served as a member of the puppet "Gold Securities" Management Committee, deliberating on gold prices and issuing gold securities. In addition, he held dozens of positions as director and supervisor in various banks, companies, and factories, which led him to resign from his position as the president of the University of Shanghai. He argued in court yesterday that after the outbreak of the Pacific War, Jian Xin, a leader in the financial community, sent him a letter from the rear area, asking him to stay in Shanghai and work. He claimed that positions such as the "Gold Securities" Management Committee were purely empty institutions, and the "Gold Securities" were issued by the puppet Central Reserve Bank and had nothing to do with the Management Committee. The other puppet positions were mostly empty names, and the defendant had tried his best to negotiate with the representative of the enemy's Ministry of Finance in Shanghai to unfreeze the deposits of Chinese people frozen in British and American banks, which was of great benefit to depositors. Lawyers Jiang Yiping and Chen Rui defended him.

In addition, the case of Li Hanqing and Xu Senfu, deputy directors of the puppet Silk Tax Bureau's collection office, will also be sentenced on the 30th.

Shen Weiting, chairman of the puppet China Tobacco Distribution Cooperative, was accused of cooperating with the enemy to control the tobacco industry.

### False Gold Bars: Shi Jin Attempts to Steal Money and Goods: Deceives Young Daughter to Negotiate: Ye Chuansheng Arrested in Minhang

[Our Newspaper's Report] In mid-month, Wu Peizhong (resident at 618 Tanggu Road) and Ye Chuansheng, two timber brokers, offered a large batch of lumber for sale to Senhe Hang at 584 Xinchang Road. The value was considerable, but the payment had not been made. Wu went to Nanjing due to some affairs. Ye suddenly had an evil thought and sneaked into Senhe Hang on the 21st, first collecting 6 million legal tender. He then bought 12 "lead bars" (weighing seven catties and four taels each), wrapped them in newspaper, and pretended they were gold bars. He delivered them to Wu's house. At the time, Wu's wife was out, and only Wu's twelve-year-old daughter was at home. Ye, thinking he could deceive the young girl, falsely claimed: "This is the payment for the lumber. Keep it safe, preferably under the bed, and give it to your father when he returns." The girl, unaware, placed the package in front of the bed. Ye then made up an excuse to coax the girl out. He then stole the package which seemed to have gold bars. An hour later, the girl returned home. Ye asked if the gold bars were there, but she could not find it. The next day, Wu returned to Shanghai from Nanjing and learned of the situation. He intended to find Ye to investigate the truth, but unexpectedly, Ye came to negotiate with Wu, and the two sides had a dispute and parted on bad terms. Wu thought the matter was quite strange, so he reported it to the Hongkou Sub-bureau. The Criminal Investigation Division sent officers to summon Cui Shanxiang, the accountant of Senhe, to inquire whether the payment was in gold bars or cash. He claimed that it was cash. They were about to summon Ye to the case, but he had already fled after hearing the news. He was finally arrested in Minhang yesterday morning and confessed to the attempted embezzlement. He is currently under interrogation.

### Each Game More Exciting Than the Last, Qunsheng Team Wins Four Straight, Shantou Team Battles Hard But Unable to Resist

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Qunsheng Basketball Team's performance is getting better and better, with each game more exciting than the last. Last night, they defeated the Shantou team with a score of 56 to 36, exceeding them by as many as 20 points. In the first half, Qunsheng led 27 to 18. Over two thousand spectators applauded thunderously. Chairman Qian Dajun and senior figures in the sports world, such as Dong Shouyi, were also present to watch.

Absolutely Wonderful

Last night, the Qunsheng team displayed their obstacle offense method, with such skill and seamless execution that, coupled with their well-coordinated teamwork and accurate shooting, they dazzled the audience. The Shantou team initially adopted a solid, steady approach, closely guarding and avoiding any rash moves. However, their skills were insufficient, their ball movement was slightly lacking, and despite fighting hard and giving their best effort, they were ultimately unable to withstand the strong team and succumbed to defeat.

Ten Baskets Behind

Before the game, team captains Chen Jinde and Chen Qingjiang exchanged pennants. Qunsheng started with their five main players: Yang Renhui, Chen Jinde, Yao Wenhua, Cai Wenzhang, and Chen Jinzhi. The Shantou team consisted of He Lide, Liu Jingxing, Chen Qingjiang, Lin Jingcong, and Ji Nankang. From the beginning, the Shantou team focused on securing possession of the ball. Although Chen Qingjiang of the Shantou team scored the first point with a free throw, Cai Wenhua immediately responded. Although the Shantou team briefly tied the score at 4-4, Qunsheng then became active, and the situation became tense. In the second quarter, Qunsheng attacked with their most skilled and agile methods. The Shantou team's man-to-man defense gradually crumbled, and Cai Wenhua and Wenzhang frequently scored, putting Qunsheng ahead 27-18 at halftime. In the second half, the Shantou team continued to combine aggression with stability, with Lin Jingcong scoring first from long range. However, Qunsheng soon became active again. Cai Wenhua's unpredictable movements were unparalleled. In desperation, the Shantou team was unable to maintain their consistently steady style of play. Later, Qunsheng substituted Cai Lianke for Cai Wenzhang, and Shantou substituted Zhou Bin for Chen Qingjiang, but the situation remained unchanged. In the end, Qunsheng won by 56 to 36, exceeding them by ten baskets, which was far beyond what was initially expected.

### Yarn Allocation Prices Rise Again by 120,000, Nearly 20,000 Applications, 5,300 Yarn Numbers Allocated, Still Some Yarn Merchants Left Empty-Handed, Middlemen Profiting, Authorities Regret

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday, due to the continuous increase in yarn prices, applications for cotton yarn from various parties to the Joint Yarn Sales Committee reached an unprecedented level. It is estimated that private factories applied for approximately 9,000 units, and the China Textile Construction Company (CTCC) applied for approximately 10,000 units, totaling nearly 20,000 units, far exceeding the previous application amount. After discussions at the Sales Committee meeting, the decision was made to sell 20-count cotton yarn at a standard quota of 3,797.5 units for private factories and 1,496.5 units for CTCC (CTCC's information indicates 1,400.5 units). The selling price was set at 1.55 million yuan per 400-pound unit of 20-count cotton yarn. This is an increase of 120,000 yuan compared to the previous allocation price.

CTCC's cotton yarn was listed for sale yesterday morning, with eight types available. The trading did not start until around 7:00 PM, and sixteen-count to forty-two-count yarns were allocated, mostly to towel factories, dyeing and weaving factories, canvas factories, handicraft weaving factories, and knitting and underwear factories. The selling price was 100,000 to 200,000 yuan higher than the previous period, but still much cheaper than the black market. As for the various yarn merchants, they were completely left empty-handed. The current spot price for 80-count double-strand single-bull-head yarn is 5 million yuan, and the spot price for 60-count three-strand blue phoenix yarn is 3.08 million yuan, which is 300,000 to 500,000 yuan higher than other yarn prices, so no one is importing them, but yarn merchants are slightly taking them in.

After the meeting, the chairman of the Yarn Mill Association, Wang Qiyu, and the deputy general manager of the CTCC, Wu Weijing, told reporters that the application amount was particularly large before this yarn allocation. Based on past application situations, the maximum was only 5,000 to 6,000 units. This time, the application amount was close to 20,000 units, which implies speculation. However, the Sales Committee still allocated to actual users as appropriate. Although the allocation price has increased slightly, it is still 220,000 to 230,000 yuan lower per unit than the market price of 20-count yarn on the same day. It is said that the committee's position is to steadily promote its affairs under the dual prerequisites of implementing the government's policy of suppressing and stabilizing prices and safeguarding the legitimate interests of the industry. The only concern is that sacrificing the interests of the industry will not benefit the general public, but rather the profit-seeking middlemen.

Actual Sales Become Stronger, Production Decreases Instead

The main reason for the recent increase in yarn prices is said to be that it is the autumn season, actual sales are becoming stronger, and demand has increased sharply. On the one hand, the production conditions of various yarn mills are still severely restricted. In terms of electricity, each factory has to stop production for one day every six days. In addition, the power company sometimes has irregular temporary power outages due to over-limit loads. As a result, an average of more than 300,000 yarn spindles have stopped working in both national and private factories, and some workers have also become unemployed, which will inevitably affect production. Furthermore, the yarn prices in North China have recently risen, with 20-count yarn exceeding 3 million yuan per unit. All of these factors have an impact on yarn prices in this city.

Tianjin and Guangdong Stop Business, Rise Wind Slightly Reduced

Therefore, yesterday's yarn market continued to be strong and trading was still active. Tianjin merchants were not seen taking in, and Guangdong merchants were instead selling out. In principle, the market price should have fallen, but customers from Changjiang Road and Jinpu Line were searching for yarn enthusiastically, with the goal of purchasing 20-count spot goods. Because the price in the inland areas has also increased greatly following the Shanghai market, autumn sales are extremely active, and they do not hesitate to release prices to purchase. The door-to-door sales in this street were also strong, and weaving factories were purchasing a large amount of 42-count double-strand thread. However, around noon, due to foreign banks dumping black market U.S. dollars, the exchange rate returned to the 4,000 yuan level, and gold prices also fell. In addition, the news from Tianjin indicated that yarn prices were trending downward. The exuberant rising momentum in the market was slightly reduced, and the price was not much different from yesterday's market. As the end of the month approached, perhaps due to tight monetary conditions, the public was also deeply cautious. If there are no other changes, the market situation may be able to stabilize.

### Cotton Cloth Becomes a Buying Frenzy, Grey Cloth Has a Price and Is Immediately Searched For, Without Any Goods Available, Association Announces: Do Not Take the Opportunity to Hoard and Speculate

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday, the cloth market became even more expensive. Purchasers crowded the counters, determined to buy, and manufacturers were willing to pay any price for suitable grey cloth to make up for the shortage. As a result, Dragon Head Fine Cloth was priced but unavailable. Blue V and Wufu were as high as 945,000 yuan, and old goods of Sijunzi Yuan Biji were asking for nearly 110,000 yuan, but there was still a lot of searching. This phenomenon is really due to the thinning of the stock and the simultaneous launch of sales in this street and customer sales, resulting in a situation where supply cannot meet demand. However, in the afternoon, the black market exchange rate of U.S. dollars suddenly fell, and money also became tighter, so the price dropped a lot.

The Cotton Cloth Association issued an emergency notice to its members yesterday afternoon, stating that the recent sharp rise in market prices has affected people's livelihoods. It stated: In the past few days, the financial market has been fluctuating violently, which has affected other prices, all of which have risen in a straight line. Cotton cloth, on the other hand, is in the peak season for autumn sales, and the actual demand is trending strongly. All parties are competing to purchase first, and North merchants are vigorously searching for them. The stock is thin, and the supply is not enough to meet the demand. As a result, the price has risen sharply and cannot be contained. This is definitely the trend of the general situation and has nothing to do with human factors. However, this association has the mission of supervising the market and suppressing and stabilizing prices. The association is issuing another earnest notice, hoping that all members will share the difficulties of the times, cooperate to stabilize market prices, and not take the opportunity to hoard and speculate, so as to value business ethics and ensure people's livelihood.

Lun Chang Cotton Cloth Stack's Single Goods Has Signed an Agreement

Regarding the Lun Chang Cotton Cloth Stack's single goods of British merchants who were victims of the robbery, it has been resolved since the Cotton Cloth Association negotiated and mediated. The Single Goods Holders Association has signed an agreement with the British Merchant Lun Chang Association. From today, the single goods holders can take the single goods to the association to handle the accounting and distribution procedures, and then take the single goods to the Lun Chang Stack to pick up the goods.

### CTCC Prevents Hoarding: Overdue Goods Must Pay Warehouse Rent

To prevent hoarding, the CTCC has made the following regulations for overdue deliveries of cotton yarn totaling two thousand bales previously stored by customers in the company's factories:

(1) All orders issued before the end of August that have not yet been picked up must be picked up within five days (from September 26th to September 30th). Overdue orders will be charged warehouse rent.

(2) Stacked yarn orders issued in September must be picked up within ten days (from September 26th to October 5th). Overdue orders will be charged warehouse rent.

(3) The unit for goods is calculated by the piece. Cotton yarn is calculated at 40 small packages per piece, cloth is calculated at 40 bolts per piece, sacks are calculated at 500 sacks per piece, and woolen cloth is calculated at four large pieces (60 yards per piece) per piece. Units less than one piece will be calculated proportionally. Units exceeding one piece but less than two pieces will also be calculated proportionally. Small numbers beyond one piece, less than one-tenth of a whole piece, may be waived.

(4) Each piece will be charged a warehouse rent of 1,000 national currency for each week it is overdue, 2,000 yuan for the second week, and so on. If it is less than one week, it will be calculated as one week.

(5) Customers must pay the rent and the relevant factory warehouse will issue a receipt as proof. No other fees will be charged.

### Rush to Sell, American Dollars Gradually Decline, Authorities Forbid Private Export

President Song received the Governor of the Central Bank, Bei Zuyi, at his private residence the night before last to discuss the recent surge in American dollars and the measures to be taken to suppress it. They deliberated on practical ways to stop it. Yesterday, Bei again firmly stated that the rumors of exchange rate adjustments were absolutely untrue. The Central Bank would supply as much foreign exchange as possible for the import of essential goods that met the application requirements. It was also learned that the Central Bank had previously strictly stipulated that American dollars could not be used to offset foreign exchange positions. However, there were still many private exports of American dollars, leading to repeated surges in the black market. The authorities have now decided to strictly prohibit the private export of American dollars. Anyone who privately exports more than 200 US dollars without approval will have it confiscated.

The foreign currency, American dollar, has begun to stabilize. General idle funds are abandoning dollars for gold, and there is a lack of momentum for prices to rise. It opened at 4,200 yuan in the morning and was immediately offered for sale. It once fell to 4,030 yuan, then a small number of buyers became active, and the price rose to 4,280 yuan midway. Near noon, it began to plummet again, once falling to 4,000 yuan. At noon, it hovered around 4,100 yuan. In the afternoon, foreign firms continued to sell off goods, and the regulatory authorities announced countermeasures. It once fell to 3,800 yuan and then rebounded, eventually settling around 4,000 yuan. The result was a decrease of about 1,500 yuan compared to the previous day's close. Hong Kong dollars also fell slightly from 830 yuan to around 780 yuan, a drop of 50 yuan. The final selling price for Hong Kong exchange was 800 yuan, Indian exchange was 980 yuan, and British exchange was offered at 12,800 yuan. The official exchange rate for American dollars remained unchanged, and there were no transactions.

### Reasons for the Sharp Rise in American Dollars: Private Absorption to Offset Frozen Foreign Exchange

According to a manager of a foreign firm, the recent sharp rise in the black market price of American dollars and the strength of the trend were rare in the past. There are various external explanations for the cause, including the continued arrival of foreign ships, with importers massively absorbing American dollars to settle payments, and rumors that the government will raise the exchange rate again. However, the arrival of foreign ships and the settlement of payments is a common situation and does not require a large position in American dollars. At the same time, Article 9, Paragraph 3 of the Interim Measures for the Management of Foreign Exchange by the Central Bank stipulates that if there is a balance in each bank's existing foreign exchange account as of September 30 of this year, it should be sold to the Central Bank at the market price on that day. Therefore, the government will not raise the exchange rate at this time and spend a huge amount of legal tender. However, private individuals with frozen foreign exchange are absorbing American dollars to offset their frozen deposits abroad as the time for selling to the Central Bank approaches. These powerful individuals are absorbing large quantities, which is the main reason for the sharp rise in American dollars.

### Bulls Take Profits, Chinese Stocks All Decline

Yesterday was quite volatile. At the opening, following the lingering momentum from the afternoon before, most popular stocks saw lower prices, except for Jingfu, Qin and slight increases. Mixed results were seen in unpopular stocks. After the opening, Zhu Neng rallied. Soon, large investors wanted to take profits, and a sudden surge occurred. Retail investors blindly followed, and an unusual brightness appeared midway. However, many popular stocks took the opportunity to take profits, and as a result, after the buying momentum stabilized slightly, the supply of shares loosened. After rising by half a percent, the stock market finally could not sustain it and declined. However, there were slight twists and turns midway. From 11:30, there was much panic, and buyers disappeared. The situation changed dramatically, and the shares of each stock began to break into the opening price line, which was unfavorable. Even with a small number of shorts covering, it was to no avail. The market became even weaker near the close. As a result, compared with the previous close, Yongsha and Hui declined, and Meiya, Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qin each weakened by a small half percent. Among the unpopular stocks, Tongyi, Datong, underwear, Jinglun, matches, cement, Huafeng, Wuhe, and silk were all flat, with limited declines. Jing slightly rose, while Zhongfang, Xinhe, Rongfeng, and Xinya companies declined by about half a percent. The total trading volume was 14,087,600 shares, of which Yongsha accounted for 6.64 million, Jingfu 2.4 million, Xinguang more than 1.6 million, Xinhe and Quan each 800,000, Meiya 500,000, and the rest were small and scattered. Off-market stocks were also slightly weak, credit was tight, and the outlook was dim.

### Stock Exchange Regulations: Unit of Stock Price Fluctuation

The stock exchange yesterday temporarily set the unit of stock price fluctuation as follows. Stock price fluctuation unit

Less than 100 yuan 1 jiao

100 yuan or more but less than 200 yuan 5 jiao

200 yuan or more but less than 1,000 yuan 1 yuan

1,000 yuan or more 5 yuan

### Government Bonds Flat and Weak

There was a lack of momentum for government bonds to rise. Two major investors supplied bonds at high prices in the market, and the situation was difficult to change. Trading volume was only 4 million yuan face value. Unified Class C opened at 2,150 yuan in the morning, rose slightly to 1,280 yuan, and was immediately suppressed, falling back to 1,960 yuan. It hovered around 2,000 yuan near the close. The result was a decrease of about 120 yuan compared with the previous close. Classes A and B fell 90 yuan, Class D was flat, and Class E also fell 70 yuan.

### Credit Tightens, Gold Prices Ease

Arbitrage Active, Once as High as 2.29 Million

Yesterday, the desire to buy gold suddenly increased. People generally believed that the current ratio of gold to American dollars had fallen to a limit, and arbitrage was very active. The Central Bank was struggling, and the rising trend was still in full swing. However, in the afternoon, the Central Bank supplied gold at reduced prices, and prices plummeted. It opened at 2.23 million and fell to 2.215 million due to control and profit-taking, which was affected by the weakness of the American dollar. It then stabilized. As the American dollar recovered, buyers suddenly poured in, and in an instant, the price rose to around 2.25 million. It lingered at this level for a long time. The Central Bank allocated 120 bars at a price of 2.2425 million. After 10 o'clock, arbitrage activity began from 2.14 million, and the rising trend accelerated, reaching a high of over 2.29 million. After that, it was subjected to considerable pressure, and it fell slightly to 2.265 million at noon. In the afternoon, the Central Bank sharply lowered prices and sold off, and speculators were also forced to sell due to tight credit. It plunged to 1.16 million before stabilizing. The result was a decrease of 60,000 compared to the previous close. Gold ornaments were 30,000 yuan, silver bullion was 2,800, silver dollars were slightly higher, and the unofficial interbank interest rate was tight, with interest rates ranging from 1 jiao 3 to 1 jiao 8.

### Rayon Continues to Rise

Yesterday, rayon continued to rise. The 120 Heavenly Bridge was popular. It opened at 3.54 million yuan in the morning and closed at 800,000 yuan. In the afternoon, the highest bid was over 850,000 yuan. There were transactions at 750,000 yuan in the middle. Later, some people took the opportunity to sell high, and people's hearts gradually became uncertain. Finally, it closed at 600,000 yuan, which was still 100,000 yuan higher than the previous day. Various other brands of goods were more than 100,000 yuan higher than the previous day. The price of factory-spun silk was chaotic, and ordinary goods were raised by more than 100,000 yuan. Because silk merchants considered the price of rayon to be too high and the selling price of finished products could not meet the cost, they all shifted their target and purchased factory-spun silk, causing holders to raise prices. Silk goods followed the raw materials and rose at the same time, increasing by about 10 percent. However, after the factory price increased, it was difficult to make progress in sales.

### Rice Prices Firm, Oil and Grain Rise Sharply

Yesterday, the rice market in the north and south registered a total of more than 8,000 shi of goods. Because indica rice was more popular, stores were very willing to buy it. The market once rose in the morning but turned weaker at noon. As a result, the price increased by 1,000 yuan. The arrival and sales of japonica rice were both small, and the price was firm. White yuan was still scarce, and the price of soybeans was high and stagnant. The supply of broad beans from the producing areas was scarce, and the source decreased significantly. Retail sales continued to move, and the price increased by more than 2,000 yuan. The wheat market was stable. Foreign firms inquired about bran, and factories did not ship much. The price rose by 1,000 yuan. There were no transactions in flour. New peanuts were actively traded and continued to rise by 1,000 yuan. Old goods were flat. Red sorghum was eagerly bought by distilleries and continued to rise by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Oil prices were very active in stores, with mutual purchases. Soybean and rapeseed oil both rose by 500 to 600 yuan to more than 1,000 yuan. Soybean cake was firm and slightly increased by 100 yuan.

### Municipal Chamber of Commerce Cables Ministry of Finance Requesting Exemption of Tax on Edible Oil

The Municipal Chamber of Commerce cabled the Ministry of Finance to request that crude soybean and rapeseed oil be exempted from tax for one year, stating: "The one-year exemption of business tax on food is intended to relieve the people's food supply, and the raw materials of soybean and rapeseed oil are indeed food, and their use for oil production is also for food. They should be included in the scope of food and exempted from business tax. Although cotton oil raw materials are not food, their use for oil production is necessary for the people's food supply. In addition to supplying food to the people, the surplus cotton oil can also be shipped for export and sold to European countries for refining to replace olive oil. And at this time of encouraging exports, tariffs are still exempted. If business tax is exempted to reduce costs, it can be exported in large quantities, recovering the losses and earning foreign markets."

### Foreign Stock Transactions Decrease

Foreign stock transactions decreased. Except for Jardine Matheson and Steel, which were relatively stable, the rest declined slightly under pressure from those who were closing out positions. Jardine Spinning reached a high price of 91,200 yuan, and Union Insurance reached 11,400 yuan, but there was immediate pressure, and no one maintained the price, and the market became small. The results compared to the previous close were that Jardine Matheson slightly rose, Steel was flat, and Jardine Spinning, Union Insurance, Yip, Paper, and Jardine Brewery all declined slightly.

### Ministry of Finance Registers Foreign Banks, Allows Them to Join Clearing House

It is learned that most of the foreign banks in this city have been approved for registration by the Ministry of Finance and have successively joined the Bankers Association of Members. It is now known that all registered foreign banks are allowed to participate in the clearing house as exchange members, just like Chinese banks and firms. The authorities of the clearing house have now separately assigned exchange numbers.

### Sugar Price Assessment Meeting Decides Sugar Prices Will Not Change Temporarily; Quota Sugar Distribution to be Finalized Tomorrow

It is reported that there is a great need for cotton and silk textiles in Singapore. Japanese and British goods competed for sales before the war. Now, Japan has not yet resumed production, and Britain is also too busy to do so. Therefore, if factories can improve the quality, the Nanyang market is very promising.

### Suiyuan in the Shadows

— Special Correspondent Xu Ru

Our newspaper's Suiyuan dispatch, 9th

Before the war, Suiyuan had 16 counties: Gui Sui, Salachi, Baotou, Wuchuan, Guyang, Tokto, Helingeer, Qingyonghe, Liangcheng, Jining, Taolin, Xinghe, Linhe, Wuyuan, and Dongsheng. Anbei and Woye Special Administrative Bureau, Ulanqab League: Erhan, Sizi Banner, Urat Central, East, and West Three Banners, Maoming'an Banner; Yikezhao League: Junwangsuo, Dalate Expansion, Hangjin, Jungar Banner, Otog Banner, Uxin Banner, Zasak Banner. These are the 13 banners of the U and Y Leagues, the Sui East Zheng Huang, Xiang, Hong, and Zheng Hong four banners. Tumet Special Banner. Statistics show that before the war, the entire Suiyuan Province had jurisdiction over 18 counties and bureaus, and 18 banners.

Provincial Outline: 18 Banners and 24 Counties

During the War of Resistance, the Woye Special Administrative Bureau had disputes with Ningxia Taole, with two names for one place. Ningxia established Taole, and Woye was virtually canceled. In western Suiyuan, two counties were added: Wuyuan and Linhe: Micang and Yanjiang counties, Shaba City, and Langshan Special Administrative Bureau. In the Yimeng Dalate, a training office was established, and an office was established in Taolimin, at the junction of Otog and Hangjin. These two places were also equivalent to a special administrative bureau. Currently, the entire province has 24 counties, cities, bureaus, and offices, in addition to the 18 banners, which have not been changed.

After the recovery, the five counties in eastern Suiyuan—Feng, Ji, Tao, Liang, and Xing—had four counties occupied by the Communists. Only Taolin County was under the jurisdiction of the Sui Provincial Government, and even the villages in Taolin were not fully investigated. The four banners in eastern Suiyuan were no different from the five counties in eastern Suiyuan, so all four banners also fell into the hands of the Communists. Many villages in Qingshuihe and Helingeer counties in southern Suiyuan were also occupied by the Communists. Currently, the ones that remain intact are the 13 banners of the U and Y Leagues, the Tumet Banner. The seven counties and cities in western Suiyuan—Shaba, Linhe, Zhucang, Langshan, Yanjiang, Wuyuan, and Anbei. The two counties behind Yinshan Mountain—Wuchuan and Guyang. The three counties on the Sui-Bao railway—Gui Sui, Baotou, and Salachi County, Tokto County in southern Suiyuan, Dongsheng County in western He, and Taolimin Office. Dalate Training Office. A total of 16 counties, cities, bureaus, and offices. Although the county seats of Qingshuihe and Helin counties in southern Suiyuan and Taolin County in eastern Suiyuan belong to the Sui Provincial Government, the villages have already been infiltrated and occupied by the Communists.

A Harmonious Atmosphere: Establishing a Democratic Cornerstone

The Suiyuan Provincial Government has had a history of 15 years since General Fu Zuoyi took office as chairman. It has undergone three reorganizations. The personnel for this year's reorganization are as follows: Chairman Fu Zuoyi, Committee Members Wang Zeding (concurrently Director of the Civil Affairs Department), Pan Xiuren (concurrently Director of the Education Department), Zhang Xiamin (concurrently Director of the Finance Department), Zhang Yiding (concurrently Director of the Construction Department), Chen Bingqian, Li Juyi, Rong Xiang, Zeng Houzai, and Yan Wei. Yu Chunzhai is the Secretary-General of the Provincial Government. Among them, Rong Xiang is from the Tumet Banner, and Pan Xiuren, Zhang Xiamin, and Yan Wei are all from Suiyuan. Four well-known local Han Chinese participated in the provincial government, and two of them also served as directors, which is rare since the founding of the Republic.

The councils of all counties and cities in Suiyuan have been formally established. The Provisional Provincial Council was established in Shaba in the winter before last. After the recovery, it moved to Sui and convened the second congress. This spring, the Provincial Council was also formally established. One provincial councilor is elected by the citizens of each county and city. The U and Y Leagues, the Tumet Banner, and the four banners in eastern Suiyuan each have one member. Mongolians and Han Chinese jointly participate, creating a harmonious atmosphere and establishing a democratic cornerstone. The speaker of the Provincial Council is Zhang Qin, and the deputy speaker is Yan Su, both prominent figures in Suiyuan and meritorious in the War of Resistance.

Pitiful Education: Serious School Building Problems

Before the war, Suiyuan's secondary schools included Gui Sui Provincial Middle School, Baotou Provincial Middle School, Jining Provincial Middle School, Gui Sui Provincial Normal School, Girls' Normal School, Vocational School of Engineering, Vocational School of Agriculture, National Sui Meng Normal School, Tumet Banner Middle School, and Private Zhengfeng Middle School. After the fall of Sui Bao, the schools completely stopped. Later, the following were established in western Suiyuan: National Suiyuan Middle School, Private Fendou Middle School, Suining Normal School (in Huangquqiao, Ningxia), National Yimeng Middle School (in Zasak Banner, Yimeng), Hexi Normal School (in Dongsheng).

One year after the victory, Suiyuan's secondary schools include: the largest in scale and best-equipped Fendou Middle School, founded by Chairman Fu Zuoyi; and the privately run Zhengfeng Middle School, founded by Director Pan, which is smaller in scale. Public schools include National Suiyuan Middle School, which was moved from western Suiyuan to Sui Bao, but has no school site yet. National Yimeng Middle School (still in Yimeng), Hexi Normal School was changed to Baotou Simple Normal School, and the address is still in Dongsheng. The Vocational School of Agriculture has been restored, and Baotou Provincial Middle School has been restored the fastest. The school site of Gui Sui Provincial Normal School was severely damaged, but classes have been resumed. Gui Sui Provincial Middle School has recently enrolled students, but the school site is still occupied by the military.

Originally, Suiyuan's education was very pitiful before the war, but it has become even worse since the victory. Regardless of whether it is provincial or national, they cannot even find a school site. However, private schools such as Fendou Middle School have taken advantage of the takeover to make the school site magnificent and luxurious, ranking first in Sui. The current situation is that private schools are developing well. There are also private middle schools run by Catholics and other charities, which are generally good. Elementary school education is even poorer. Elementary school teachers in various counties have not received salaries for half a year, and gentry in several counties have launched donations to maintain it. Not to mention rural elementary schools, someone inspected a rural elementary school in Wuchuan County, and it was not even as good as a dilapidated private school. Students do not know that this year is the 35th year of the Republic of China, but instead say it is "Chengji ×× year." This is certainly a very small minority, but the enemy's slave education has not yet been completely cleared, as can be seen from this.

The News Industry is Also Not as Good as Before the War

Suiyuan's news industry is still not as good as before the war. Suiyuan has two daily newspapers: (1) Minguo Daily (Party newspaper), (2) Fendou Daily (government newspaper). One evening newspaper: Suiwen Evening News. Baotou has one daily newspaper: Baotou Daily. During the war, Fendou Daily was published in Shaba, but the Shaba edition has been discontinued.

Suiyuan's news agencies include the New China News Agency, sponsored by the 12th War Zone Headquarters. Because it is government-run, it has more manpower and sufficient funding, and its scale is the largest in the province. The second is the Suiyuan News Agency, which was established before the war. The Sui Meng News Agency was founded in western Suiyuan during the war.

Out-of-town newspapers are more popular than local newspapers in Suiyuan. The Tianjin Dagongbao has the most circulation, followed by the Beiping North China Daily, the Shijie Daily, and the Nanjing Central Daily. The Shanghai newspapers that are sold in Suiyuan include the Shenbao and the Dagongbao, and the photoprint edition of the Shenbao is especially loved by the local people.

### When the Green Screen Rises: The National Army Arrives, the Harvest is Good, Everyone is Full

— Photo by Northeast Press

On the Northeast Plain, the sorghum stalks are taller than people, enough to cover their heads. It is just the time when the "green screen" that everyone often hears about rises.

The green screen is a great threat to the lives of the people in the Northeast, because the continuous large sorghum fields are where bandits hide and come and go. Today, what is in front of us is the "war disaster" that is even more severe than the banditry of the past. The green screen is the best place for a certain party to carry out sabotage or to serve as a basis for tactics.

Sorghum, the main food of the people of the Northeast, is expected to have a bumper harvest this year due to favorable weather conditions. This place introduces several beautiful pictures. They, no, they are singing the big hot year this year!

Picture description

(1) Miss Kunming is singing "Harvest Song" in the sorghum fields of the Northeast.

(2) Come on! Please have a cigarette we brought from Kunming

(3) Members of the Political Work Team of the 60th Army go to the countryside to ask how much is harvested per mu this year?

(4) The common people said that this year the National Army came, the place is peaceful, the harvest is good, and the eight members of the family are all full.

(5) The 60th Army came to the Northeast from the Southwest to take over the territory. Miss Li Hui from Kunming followed the army to work in the Northeast. Miss Southwest shakes hands with the sorghum for the first time in the sorghum fields of the Northeast

### Unemployed Military Officers Should be Received for Training

Dear Editor: I strongly agree with the point that redundant unemployed military officers should be received for training with preferential treatment. However, some unemployed military officers are rejected because they do not have complete documents. I believe that as long as they can find three active-duty military officers above the rank of colonel to certify them, they should be given preferential treatment and allowed to receive training. According to what I know, there are no fewer than several thousand people in places such as Beijing, Shanghai, Suzhou, and Wuxi who have not been able to report. They have used up all their travel expenses, are wandering and helpless, and have difficulty getting a full meal every day. The sight of this is truly pitiful. I hope the government authorities will quickly find a way to provide them with preferential treatment and receive them for training! (Ye Jingyi)

### Street Names in Taiwan Urgently Need to be Corrected

Taiwan has rejoined our country for more than a year now, and the most shocking thing is that the street names remain the same as before and have not been changed to this day! A friend of mine works at the Taiwan Salt Administration, and in a recent letter, the address of the agency on the envelope was: "Taihoku City, Honcho 2-chome, No. 5." A dignified government agency publicly prints the address of an enemy, which is truly shameless! Does it still hope that Taiwan will return to the arms of the Japanese bandits? Or are they fighting for commercial gain and blinded by profit? In this situation, the rest can be imagined. How can this not make the Taiwanese despise it and be laughed at internationally? (Xu Wenyu)

### Postal Substitute

Reply to Residents Near Ciyou Road Huizhan Street: The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities, regarding the difficulty of obtaining drinking water at the above two locations, replied to this newspaper stating: "To facilitate universal water supply, this Bureau has established the 'Shanghai Municipal Retail Tap Water Sales Method'. We kindly request you to inform the public and recommend a representative to come to Room 105, No. 50 Jiujiang Road, to discuss the installation methods with the Bureau's Water Supply Station, for the benefit of the citizens."

Reply to Mr. Mo Changgen: The letter from the Bureau of Public Utilities roughly stated: "Regarding the installation of faucets in the South Shanghai District, they are exclusively for firefighting purposes by the district's fire brigade and have never been opened to the public. The free opening of some fire hydrants in the city this summer was a temporary emergency measure due to the epidemic. It should not be regarded as a regular means of providing relief for civilian drinking water."

Reply to Mr. Huang Zhixin: Regarding your inquiry about the sale of subsidized sugar, we have recently received a reply from the Bureau of Social Affairs stating: "The city's sugar purchase method has already been changed in terms of its detailed procedures, and the organizing agency will announce it. It is expected to be implemented in October. Please inform him accordingly."

A letter from the Municipal Senior Vocational School stated: "After the summer vacation, this school formulated the tuition fees for this semester and submitted them to the Bureau of Education for approval. Subsequently, we received instructions from the Education Bureau: the approved fees for the vocational classes of this school are 30,000 yuan for teacher appreciation, 30,000 yuan for accommodation, 20,000 yuan for equipment, and 8,000 yuan for miscellaneous expenses, totaling 88,000 yuan per student, not 250,000 yuan. As for meals, they are handled by a student-organized committee. 100,000 yuan is collected in advance at the beginning of the semester and handed over to the meal association upon its establishment. We hope this can be published for the benefit of the students."

### On Democratic Politics

— Lixing

By C. D. Burns

Translated and Published by The Commercial Press

This book discusses political philosophy, mainly explaining the ideals of democratic politics. According to its ideals: "Democratic politics is a moving emotional concept of a society yet to be created; in this society, all men and women have equal rights to enjoy all the benefits of civilized life—such as protection from violence and tyranny, adequate property and leisure, so that everyone can freely develop their inherent talents; but the most important of these talents is the ability to work with others for a common goal. Therefore, the ideal of democracy includes a society in which all members voluntarily contribute their thoughts and emotions to this common storehouse, and also contribute the usual work for the sake of maintaining civilized life." Although modern democratic systems are still far from this ideal, the right-wing authoritarian Fascists and the left-wing authoritarian Communists who have risen up to attack it are not necessarily reasonable, and may even be worse than what they attack. It repeatedly argues, and there are many very novel and insightful opinions in it, which are worth our reference. This book has been translated into Chinese by Mr. Sun Siming, and now I will introduce a summary of it.

The Origin of Democracy

The book has seven chapters, the first chapter talks about "The Origin of Democratic Politics." One of the paragraphs describes how Britain developed into the motherland of democratic constitutionalism, and the understanding is very thorough. It is said that... "The British were the first to give the monarch a real limit, so that he could not help but be restrained in deciding when and how to get money. It was also the British who, for nearly nine hundred years, were always accustomed to having foreigners as kings, such as the Norman dynasty, the Burton Jena dynasty; the Hutton dynasty, the Stuart dynasty, and the current Hanover dynasty, who could be miraculously or directly controlled by the local landlords and the House of Commons. Now everyone in practice inherits and accepts cabinet politics and cabinet members are responsible to Parliament, which is the result of the English king not being a British custom." This shows that the development of democratic politics is probably a historical development. Our people often forget this lesson when talking about democracy, which should arouse everyone's attention.

Chapter Two, "The Evangelical Establishment", mainly talks about the theories and systems that oppose democratic politics, and also has very insightful views on the causes of Fascism and Communism. He said: "Fascist dictatorship can always be traced back to the back of Marx, and can be traced back to Marx's teacher Ritzier. —Its theory can also be attributed to the power politics of the nineteenth century."

Democracy and Merits and Demerits

Chapter Three talks about the merits and demerits of democratic politics, and makes powerful defenses of the freedom of rights, the right to vote, party politics, and the worship of incompetence that are often criticized by opponents of democracy. The author said: The modern ideal of personality does not regard man as an atom, but as a major part of society, so when we mention freedom, we never leave any social relationship. Nor does it only refer to the protection of others, but to the power of everyone to do their best, especially in the cooperation of friendship in common work." This has destroyed and cleared up the atomic individualism of the eighteenth century. He also said, "All intelligence has a strong emotional color. ...Democratic politics does not regard people as calculating machines... In fact, the bad thing about an appeal to emotion lies in the actual use of degraded emotions, not in the emotion itself." This has also greatly revised the old "rationalism". He also said: "Democratic politics does not contain the idea that human wisdom is equal or should be made equal. Human equality is only an assumption." This also clearly explains the misunderstanding of the theory of social equality.

Chapter Four talks about "Democratic Institutions", divided into (1) representative elections, (2) opponents can form political parties to openly discuss public policies, (3) cabinet members are responsible to a popularly elected parliament or a popularly elected president to manage the administration. "Democratic institutions originally wanted to bring together the mountain criticism of human power and the agile decisions and firm actions of those in power in the same political system." He also said: "In all democratic countries, there is now a tendency to centralize power in the executive branch." This view is similar to the "separation of powers" advocated by the founding father. He also said: "Civil rights and the rule of law are maintained by the courts in democratic politics." Nowadays, most gentlemen who discuss democratic constitutionalism in our country pay little attention to this point, which is also worthy of special mention. He also said: "Under a democratic system, the various institutions of the government are all integrated." This is also very consistent with the spirit of the Five-Power Constitution advocated by the founding father.

Two Problems with Democratic Institutions

Chapter Five talks about "Democracy and Peace". He said: "The entire movement of democratic politics includes a rejection of the most outdated traditional political institution—war and the preparation for war. ...The League of Nations system is a natural result of the development of democratic politics in the art of government; but if the main member states are not all democratic countries, the League of Nations system will not be able to function at all."

Chapter Six, "Democracy and Industry," mainly discusses the labor policies that democratic governments should take. It opposes vocational representation, saying: "In this book, we do not recognize that democratic politics is just a balance of competing interests; ...but a tool for expressing the will for the public welfare shared and established by everyone, then a person's neighbors and nearby colleagues are actually the best tools to enable him to learn how to unite for a real common welfare. It also opposes class struggle. It believes that "a war always requires a clear distinction between the two sides; and in the modern state, if we want to start Marx's war, there are too many no-man's lands." It believes that the trade union movement and the consumer cooperative movement that have emerged under the democratic system have enabled tens of thousands of workers to learn about democratic politics, while in the authoritarian governments of Fascists or Communists, all trade unions are not automatically organized groups of workers, but are creations of a ruling minority. This kind of trade union is a reaction that makes the dependent ability of workers that comes from slave civilization tend to democracy. These words are worthy of considerable consideration by the gentlemen who are now drafting the constitution and presiding over the labor movement in our country.

The Superiority of Democratic Institutions

Chapter Seven, "The Spirit of Democracy," specifically discusses the educational system and methods that democratic countries should have. It said: "If we want to make democratic institutions necessarily effective, then a democratic social atmosphere must first be created in schools and other educational institutions." It also said, "Democratized education must import the concept that everyone lives in a common life." It also said: "Schools should contribute to a new patriotism, so that it can not only defend and triumph; but also make closer contacts and mutual services with other countries." We believe that educators in the era of the United Nations should regard these words as the standard.

In short, Mr. Bao is a defender of democratic politics. He believes that democratic institutions still have many shortcomings; but before other better systems have been invented, they should be improved or abolished by democratic methods—that is, open discussion of public policies and free criticism, and then established authority. He hates and ridicules the most those who prohibit open discussion and free criticism, such as Fascists or Communists. One said: "No matter what kind of power system, it only reduces the intelligence and vitality of the people under its rule. Therefore, the dictatorship's raising the status of leaders or a few people in power is actually at the expense of reducing the moral status of the majority of men, women, old and young." The other said: "Their opposition is just like the confrontation between barbarism and civilization, and the confrontation between martial arts and science." These words seem to be a bit too much. From an objective point of view, during the fascist regime in Italy and the national socialist regime in Germany, all aspects of politics, economy and culture were much more advanced than before; since the Bolsheviks came to power in the Soviet Union, they have vigorously implemented the socialist planned economy, and all science and technology have made great strides; to this day, American reporters report that it does not make progress intentionally, nor does it corrupt; these are all undeniable facts. Can we say that intelligence has regressed? Can we say it is barbaric? I believe that things within the scope of social science are always inevitably different in terms of good and evil due to time and place, and cannot be generalized. Mr. Bao's statement may be influenced by traditional social assumptions or cultural standards!

### Recent Children's Publications

— Dayan

Under various material difficulties, publishing a publication is really not an easy task; children's publications are of course the same.

Another difficult thing is the content of children's publications, in addition to being meaningful, needs to be realistic, and more importantly, interesting; most children are not easy to take care of. And books are originally static things, so they must be in line with the times, the season, and full of activity.

Therefore, a children's publication is very difficult to please, which is why some publishers who are afraid of "losing money" do not dare to try it easily.

On the contrary, another kind of "toxic" comic strips have been developing abnormally, inducing pure children everywhere in the streets and alleys. This is really not the most dangerous phenomenon.

But we have no way to stop them from reading those harmful things, because they all have an unstoppable desire for knowledge, not to mention that comic strips are a very good form, even if there is no content, but the children there know this "toxic"?

If it can be used to instill good children's knowledge, it must be very successful. In the past, the Popular Bookstore published comic books with good stories, such as "Robinson Crusoe", "Tai Lan Joins the Army", etc., which were quite popular among children, but the oppression at that time was too great, so it gradually faded away, which is very regrettable; recently, comic strips in major newspapers such as Sanmao Joins the Army, etc., children readers seem to be more than adults, therefore, I hope comic authors, take this into account, and also write more for children.

We can only try our best to introduce children's publications with good content and full of activity, and publications of this form of "comic strips", to pull children away from those "toxic" "reading materials". Severe prevention is not a good way.

In the recent children's publication industry that seems to be very lively, there is only one that is completely in the form of Daohong; but general publications are very able to pay attention to also using illustrations as much as possible, helping to instill excellent children's knowledge. These publications can generally meet the conditions of children's reading materials, but of course they still need to constantly strive for improvement.

Now we will introduce those very promising children's publications for the reference of parents.

The Children's Bookstore's "Children's Knowledge" has published its second issue, which is the only monthly magazine that is completely in the form of continuous pictures; according to the two issues published, they are indeed working hard to achieve the three points of new, refined, and interesting. The text connected to the books is quite simple, and Gang paintings are sometimes used in colored editions, which is very helpful in arousing children's interest. The content is also quite rich; but for use as a "primer" for children, it sometimes seems a little complicated and overwhelming, and is more suitable for low-grade elementary school students. In today's children's reading materials, it can indeed be said to be a publication with vision and courage.

"Children's World" has been presided over by Mr. He Gongchao since it moved to Shanghai. These issues are all Chongqing editions. According to Mr. He at a reception, after the Chongqing edition is finished, the content will be innovated immediately, and realistic texts will be added as much as possible, so that children will feel intimate when they read it. Introducing various daily knowledge and new science will enable children to understand the times and encourage progress. It is expected that it will be a refreshing experience for me and others.

The one with the most content is the "Primary School Student Semi-Monthly Magazine", which is a middle and high-grade children's publication that contains a wider range and is full of activity. We can often see fairy tales written in lively and interesting writing styles that are suitable for the times and national conditions, scientific knowledge introduced in concise and clear language, and "small crafts" and "primary school student gardens" to encourage children to write and use their hands. Compared to the materials for training them to use their hands, there are fewer. There are also illustrations in the text, which are quite good, but also a little less. The arrangement uses horizontal lines and two sizes of characters, which has advantages and disadvantages. However, the editors and authors, Mr. Han, pay attention to being fully active, which is a feature.

The "Children's Weekly" of the China Pictorial Publishing House has the least content, but it is not easy to publish it every week. The content is mostly fairy tales and stories, with less science; the text can be concise and maintain the past relaxed style.

There is also a monthly magazine "Era Children", which is rich in content and full, concise and specific; it is suitable for senior elementary school children to read. However, it was not published during the summer vacation, so there is one less good children's reading material.

In the past, major newspapers such as Shen Bao all had children's periodicals. Now only Da Wan Bao still has "Children's Paradise" edited by Mr. Shen Baiying, which is published every Monday. It is a pity that the most common newspapers lack food for children.

Generally speaking, the content, text, and printing of these publications are quite advanced, and it can also be seen that some educators and authors who care about children are doing their best, never being shoddy, and striving for progress, which can be congratulated for children and for the country.

Wise parents! Introduce them to your children more, that will be a valuable thing, and it is also some of the responsibilities that parents should have.

### Reading Quotations

"Guan Tingyao asked about learning, and I said, painters say that it is easy to paint ghosts, but difficult to paint horses, because ghosts have no quality, while horses have evidence. Now those who talk about the Book of Changes and the Supreme Ultimate Diagram each come up with their own mental and manual images, which are chaotic and lead to good knowledge. Those who are rampant and self-satisfied, silently have things, are all painting ghosts. You are determined to learn to be a son, a subject, a brother, a friend, rites, music, soldiers, and farmers, and you are only painting horses." (Li's legacy on learning)

### New Theory of Construction Geography

— Naya

By Ren Meiao Published by The Commercial Press Publication Date: June of the 35th Year 135 Pages

At present, our young people do not pay attention to geography books, especially extracurricular ones; this is of course because these books are too "bitter medicine". This attitude is absolutely wrong in our China, which is waiting for revival and construction.

May I ask: What is the post-war reconstruction work? To answer in one sentence: It depends on economic construction; from this, we understand the importance of paying attention to geography books. The chaotic construction of post-war China depends on the efforts of every young person. First, we must "know", and then "act"; from this, we understand the importance of reading even more.

Mr. Ren Meiao has lectured on economic geography and construction geography at Central, Zhejiang, Fudan and other universities; Here, Mr. Ren has integrated eleven papers published in the Chongqing Ta Kung Pao over the past six years, and one recent work, into a book, and named it: "New Theory of Construction Geography".

The content of this book includes three articles on principles, five on industrial areas, three on land use, and one on transportation geography; among these, the eleven published articles have been revised according to the latest materials, and repeated and unsuitable places have been deleted.

Mr. Weng Wenhao also said in the preface to this book: "...Looking forward, how to consolidate the national foundation, establish national defense, and strive to achieve a prosperous and strong state, and maintain permanent peace with all countries in the world, the work in the future will be very difficult... Regarding the way of effort, we should first promote economic construction, and the implementation of construction must clearly understand the way of adapting to local conditions, the method of balanced development, the division of economic zones, and the distribution of resource reserves, so the knowledge of geography is still important... Mr. Ren Meiao has selected the results of his research over the years, and published them in articles, advocating the connection between construction and the environment, which is highly valued by the general public... The dissemination of geographical knowledge will be wider from this, and the geographical research of economic construction will gradually rise..."

Indeed, this book has a very wide content. The three articles on principles: Geographical Research and Economic Construction; The Theoretical System of Economic Geography. These three chapters of articles tell us about the geographical research of the National Industrial Plan, discussing the tasks and training of geographical engineers; the nature and scope of economic geography, the central idea, and dynamic economic geography.

From this, we know that economic geography is a systematic and living science. The theoretical system about it has been roughly established. In terms of transportation and commercial geography, we do not yet have a clear regional status theory, which is waiting for our continued research to elaborate and develop.

The five articles on industrial areas: Research on the Theory of Industrial Areas, The Idea of Industrial Location in Industrial Planning, China's Industrial Center after the War, and the Outline of China's Southwest National Defense Industrial Area.

Here, the micro-research on industrial areas, the dynamic industrial location, the political factors and industrial machinery are described; the location of various industries and its principles; each topic has been fully elaborated and explained.

The three articles on land use: Geographical Research on the Location of the Iron and Steel Industry Area, A Preliminary Proposal for Conducting a National Land Use Survey, and Land Use near Zunyi, Guizhou; it describes the relationship between raw materials and factory location of the iron and steel industry, the geographical distribution of the iron and steel industry, and the review of the location of China's iron and steel industry, etc., and introduces it clearly with clear tables.

The one article on transportation geography, the new situation of world geography in the air age, is just as Bacon said! "Don't be superstitious anymore, we have to open our eyes and look at the reality of the world." In the air age, world geography (including China) has undergone tremendous changes, and the process of this change has been briefly described in the book.

The book contains a book review, which is Soils and Man published by the United States Department of Agriculture in 1938. This was co-authored by more than 100 experts from the Department of Agriculture and is indeed one of the main issues in the modern world. A brief introduction was made.

In short, this book can be read in a very short time and can gain a lot of knowledge, which is a must-read for our young people.

Spring and Autumn

### Random Jottings from a Mountain Abode

— Dai Wangshu

Mountain Wind

Outside the window, through the veil of night, the misty mountain air probably enshrouds the entire peak. The cool wind plunges straight down from the mountain summit, bringing dampness, bringing the scent of the sun, or bringing a few drops of water splashed from the mountain stream, knocking on our glass window.

Greetings, mountain wind! I open the window to welcome you, I open my coat to welcome you.

Having caressed the edge of the clouds, caressed the small flowers by the cliff, caressed the rocks where wild beasts have lain, caressed the silent earth, the singing stream, you now come to gently caress me. Tell me, mountain wind, do you sense from my chest the fleeting nature of clouds, the loneliness of flowers, the solidity of rocks, the somberness of earth, the liveliness of streams? Will you say: This is a strange creature!

Trees

The roadside trees have been completely felled, leaving only sparse and pitiful roots. The road seems a bit wider, a bit shorter, and the distance to the sky seems closer. The sun shines directly on my head, and pours directly onto my body… Yes, we need sunshine, but we also need shade! The chirping of birds in the morning is gone, the leisurely stroll in the evening is gone. Empty road, lonely road!

Not far from the front of the door, there used to be a mimosa tree. Last autumn, I even picked the long pods for my daughter to play with. It once stood gracefully there, its verdant canopy spread high, entrusting our dreams and giving us cool shade. But now, we can only futilely depict its verdant form in the void, against the backdrop of a blue sky dotted with wing fragments. On a summer morning like this, what a refreshing feeling its bright green leaves and fiery red, eye-catching flowers would give us! What joy the small cries of fledgling birds hidden in its dense shade would give us! Think about it, how sad is its disappearance to me!

Holding my young child, I walked again to the roots of that mimosa tree. The saw marks have turned from pale yellow to dark black, but the annual rings are still clear, not eroded by moss or fungus. I idly counted the rings: forty-two rings! Exactly my age. It and I spent the same years, this poor mimosa tree!

Tree, who is more unfortunate, you or I?

Lost Garden

Toiling anxieties have deprived me of the breadth of vision and the leisure to which I could entrust myself. What I mean is, since I moved to the highest street in this central district, fearing the long journey, I can no longer see the sea every day, nor own a small garden. Behind the house are tall buildings, in front are even higher mountains; the door faces the street, without a single patch of open space. From then on, I have lived facing a wall of mountains, and what makes me most melancholy is especially that small garden in the old residence, that piece of barren land that I personally reclaimed, cultivated, fertilized, sowed, watered, and harvested. That garden faced the sea, surrounded by verdant pine trees. Whenever I was tired of plowing, I would drop my hoe, sit under the pine trees, facing the wind blowing from the distant sails, looking at the vast sea, and it would already make my heart feel refreshed. Moreover, it gave us unexpectedly abundant harvests according to the seasons.

Since moving here, everything has changed. The farm tools, hoes, rakes, spades, pointed hoes, weeding rakes, transplanting bells, watering cans, etc., that were carried on a large cart along with the books, have been coldly abandoned on the rooftop terrace, and have become rusty. These poor things, they should be as lonely as I am.

As if instinctively, I often think: "Now is the time to plant tomatoes," or "Now the corn can be harvested," or "If only I could get some broad bean seeds from my hometown!" I voiced this thought to my wife, so she suggested: "Should we, like the neighbors, have someone carry mud to the rooftop terrace to create a garden there?" But I immediately objected, because the terrace on the roof is so small, and there is so little sunlight, completely blocked by the surrounding tall buildings.

So this plan was abandoned, but the dream of the old garden continued.

Probably seeing that I was often troubled by this thought, my wife was secretly working on something. Suddenly one day, she came to me happily and said: "We can have a real garden. Don't you see there is a vacant lot across from our neighbor? They have few people and can't plant much land. I have already discussed it with them. They will allocate a portion of the land for us to plant. Water is also convenient; we don't have to carry it. Now, tell me when to start."

She must have thought this would give me an unexpected joy, but I answered vaguely, thinking in my heart: "That is not my garden. I want my own garden." But, in order not to embarrass my wife too much, I hesitated and replied to her: "Didn't you advise me not to be too tired? You are right. I need rest. Let's abandon this plan of planting land."

But the dream of the old garden continued, secretly.

The car arrived at the station. The hawkers' cries floated in through the window. Countless strange, curious, foolish faces, as if engraved with the words "struggle for survival," crowded under the car window.

Passengers getting off the car, some taking rickshaws, some walking, went on the ancient road perpendicular to the highway on the right. On the distant ancient road were planted green weeping willows. It was also shrouded in smoke. Very Chinese. At the end of the road was a secluded ancient city. This ancient city was originally unfamiliar to me. But for me, who am good at yearning, it has become a

Mysterious puzzle. I felt as if I was in a dream. I mused that there must be infinite happiness hidden in Zhan City? There must also be fiery passion like fire-red pomegranates? There must also be a first love as sweet as my hometown? But the travelers, harboring different dreams, filed in a row, treading the willow-lined road to the heavenly kingdom of dreams, walking farther and farther... finally disappearing into the gray city of dusk.

"Why does the horizon always seem to be walked in a dream?..." Murmuring the line of poetry, I realized that I was a wandering traveler. Unconsciously, the wheels under my feet were rolling again.

### The Hungarian Playwright Molnár

— Xu Tonghua

If you happened to be sightseeing in New York in the winter of 1908, you couldn't help but go see "The Devil," a famous play written by Hungarian playwright Ferenc Molnár. This was perhaps an unprecedented initiative in the New York theater world, with four theater companies performing it simultaneously, two using English dialogue, one in German, and one in Yiddish.

The play "The Devil" not only caused a sensation in New York but also swept across the United States. Theater managers couldn't find suitable stars for a while because they were all playing the character of Dr. Miller in the play, and even the elaborate costumes worn by Dr. Miller caused panic.

For more than thirty years, Molnár's masterpieces have been staged seventeen times in New York, and only a few American playwrights can maintain this record of honor. His important works include "Carousel," "The Guardsman," "The Good Fairy," and "Liliom." It is said that among contemporary writers, only George Bernard Shaw, Somerset Maugham, and Eugene O'Neill can compare with him.

Molnár went to the United States in January 1940. He was born in Budapest on January 12, 1878. His original surname was Neumann, which he later changed to Molnár because he did not want to use any surname with a German odor, driven by patriotism, with the aim of promoting local Hungarian literature.

In the preface to a collection of plays, he gave a summary of his past life, up to 1925:

"In 1878, I was born in Budapest. In 1896, I was a student studying law in Geneva. In 1896, I was a journalist in Budapest. In 1897, I wrote a short story. In 1900, I wrote a novel. In 1902, I became a playwright in the country. In 1908, I was a playwright known abroad. In 1914, I was a war correspondent. In 1916, I was a playwright again. In 1918, my hair was snow-white. In 1925, I wanted to become a student studying law in Geneva again."

Molnár's father was a very busy doctor. He himself recalled that there were many patients sitting in a dark waiting room, with a melancholic and depressing characteristic. Molnár loved to joke with patients since childhood. Once, it was so bad that he almost scared his own grandmother to death, but according to Molnár himself, this did not happen. His grandmother only broke a leg.

He attended many schools during his school days. In his spare time, he liked to sit in cafes, take out paper and pens, and sketch. His play "Liliom" was written on a marble-topped table in one of the busiest restaurants in Budapest.

Molnár spoke French, German, and Italian fluently. But when he went to the United States in 1940, he only knew a little English. One night, he attended a banquet. All the guests spoke English, which made him feel very painful. After the banquet, he said to a compatriot: "I can't speak English, it's terrible. I can only say, 'Where is my hat?' But this sentence doesn't seem to attract people's attention." Now he is proficient in English. In his residence, there are many English dictionaries, and he is trying to write a new script in English.

In addition, Molnár is not only a playwright but also a novelist. The book "The Hungry City," published in 1901, satirized the corruption of Budapest, very powerfully. His recent work, "Farewell, My Heart," was published by Simon & Schuster in 1945. His own favorite work is a long novel on the theme of a dancer's tragic love affair.

### The Permanence of Art

— Xiao Feng

American English professor C. Twinchster once said: "Although the scholarship of Homer's time has been abandoned, Homer still exists in the present, and he has not aged. Why can't Homer be abandoned? This is because he appeals to the unchanging human emotions of ancient and modern times. That is, although individual emotions are born and die in an instant, the ocean of emotions exists in all ages and remains unchanged."

From this statement, he put forward the permanence of art. He believed that the "permanence" of art is built on the "unchanging human emotions of ancient and modern times." The "unchanging human emotions of ancient and modern times" here is not the "pure artistic quality" proposed by the aesthetic school, but the "combativeness" and "universality" of art. From the combativeness and universality of art, one can write out the immortal truth. This immortal truth constitutes the "permanence" of art.

If we do not deny that "to live is to fight," then art is born from this fight of life. On the road of life, humanity encounters many tragic battles. In these tragic battles, people sometimes groan and shout, sometimes sigh and weep, and sometimes sing the glory of victory and indulge in joy and praise. At this time, the outburst of voice is art. Therefore, art is the crystallization of humanity's struggle with reality, like the sparks that fly out when iron and stone collide, endowed with infinite light and heat.

Cai Leiteli believed that art is a weapon of human struggle. This further expands the scope of life, from the struggle between man and nature to the struggle between man and man. He believed that art is not only a product of struggle but also a tool in the struggle. Nietzsche also said: "Of all writing, I love that written in blood the most." This more emphatically pointed out the "combativeness" of art.

In Ibsen's works, "A Doll's House" and "An Enemy of the People" fully demonstrate the characteristics of combat. He mercilessly aimed his pen at the dark family system and social system of the feudal era, attacking them with a combative posture, prompting them to collapse and accelerating their demise.

While the combative arts can form the permanence of art, the permanent arts, in addition to containing combativeness, also have a universal nature.

The creation of art has undoubtedly broken free from the shackles of idealism, walked out of the narrow and fictional cage, and is stepping on the road of reality. Writers are not only writing about the joys and sorrows of individuals but also writing about the joys and sorrows of the vast masses. The creation of art is not only for the entertainment of the aristocratic class but also to serve as the spiritual food of the masses, making art a popular thing.

Homer is almost three thousand years away from us now, but Homer still lives vividly in our minds. Homer's existence is not his own immortality, but that his works have permanent value.

In ancient Greece, he drifted from city to city, singing to the vast masses, singing the stories in his works. As a result, his epic poems "The Iliad" and "The Odyssey" were deeply engraved in the hearts of the masses, and the characters in the story lived forever with Homer. These two popular poems were constantly recited and sung in people's mouths, passed down from generation to generation, and have not disappeared to this day. I can say that Homer's ability to exist permanently is because his works have a universal nature, so they can be passed down forever in everyone's mouth without being erased.

From the combativeness of art, writers point out the mistakes of the times and expose the darkness of society. They use a combative pen to destroy the decadent and dark social system, giving the future era a correct path.

From the universality of art, writers not only write about the joys and sorrows of individuals but also write about the joys and sorrows of everyone, making art the spiritual food of everyone, and no longer offering it in the aristocratic vases, as entertainment for their boredom.

Great artistic creations have "combativeness" and "universality." From the "combativeness" and "universality" of art, one can write out that painful truth. This painful truth constitutes the "permanence" of art.

Finally, let me write down a poem by Dobrolyubov:

No need for flattering ballads,

No need for lyrical poems to recite,

No need for bards' odes,

But rather an inspired old man,

To reveal that painful truth.

### An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood 44

— Ye Jingfeng

Around nine o'clock that evening, the Japanese artillery fire became more and more intense, with shells flying into the north, northeast, and east of Changxindian. I thought that the Chinese garrison in Changxindian was all around the Yongding River west of the town. The town and the four villages were all factory areas and rural farmers' residences. Why were the Japanese shells being fired here? Suddenly, I remembered the scene from that morning when I visited Dingyuan. That kind of sad atmosphere reappeared; the head of the family, thin and emaciated, lying in bed, his wife's face full of sorrow, forcing a smile, talking to me; Meijun quietly running back and forth, taking care of the patient's needs, solving the temporary problems of her younger siblings, and occasionally, on the side, correcting her mother's forgotten words, while seizing the most appropriate opportunity to smile quietly at her father sleeping on the sickbed, as if to use this smile to maintain her father's spirit.

At this time, I really wanted to go see Dingyuan again and try to tell him to move out of the factory as soon as possible; because the target of the shells on the edge of Changxindian might be this factory. But where could they move to in a hurry? While I was considering, a telegram came, and it was an urgent secret telegram. After receiving it, I translated it. It was sent by Tsurumi just before leaving for Japan. He said that the power station in Changxindian might have to be moved to the northwest or southeast; because Tsurumi, taking advantage of the failure of this "three-part" plan, gave a lot of bad medicine to Matsui in the headquarters, asking the headquarters to transfer them back, and strongly recommending Yamamoto Eiji, and others to take over. I understood this very well, because Doihara was the head of the Lan group's special agents, and Matsui and others were subordinates of the Lan group's special agents. Transferring them to the headquarters meant not letting them operate. At the same time, they could take the opportunity to send the weaker Mei group, such as Kita, to North China, which could also reduce some trouble. At the same time, they could also suppress Doihara's power a little.

At the same time, Tsurumi predicted that Doihara, the head of the Lan group, would definitely not be willing, and might transfer Matsui and others to the northwest or southeast to start a new business. When Matsui was transferred, we would follow them. Because our purpose was to slightly support the Mei group and the Matsu group, and to attack the Lan group, implementing a split between these three spy organizations. Tsurumi also mentioned the Tongzhou incident, asking me to take the time to go see it.

This telegram delayed me another half an hour, and it was getting later. "When exactly should I go see Dingyuan; now? Or tomorrow morning?" I thought to myself. There was originally such a superstition in the north that one should not visit the sick at night, because night belongs to yin, and patients are most afraid of yin; and even visiting the sick at night means that the illness is dangerous.

Thinking to myself, I went out the door, preparing to go to the top of the earthen hill to see the artillery fire. Just as I stepped out the door, I caught sight of a long line of people moving on the road going to the Railway Bureau's power plant in the dim moonlight.

"Sneak attack!" I was shocked, and immediately called someone to bring binoculars.

"Kimura's men, carrying parcels and boxes." No. 4 took a quick look and immediately told me, "It seems they are going to the Bureau's factory."

### Canned Stones

— Shao Fu

Among the items distributed to public school personnel, mold and rot are often found, and many people express dissatisfaction, believing that it is a waste to spend money to buy these inedible things. However, the people at the distribution office say that this is a very rare phenomenon, and if moldy or rotten items are found, they can be exchanged with the original item.

This is not only the case with the items distributed to public school personnel, but also with ordinary relief supplies, which inevitably suffer from mold and rot. However, like the report from Nanchang in yesterday's newspaper: "When the Jiangxi Relief Branch of the Executive Yuan distributed canned milk, beef, and other relief supplies, the agencies receiving these items found that the wooden boxes containing the cans had cans on top and stones on the bottom..." This situation is not a natural loss but a man-made act of fraud.

Whether the surplus materials from the United States are allocated to us or transferred to us, in whatever form, I wonder if there was a clause for "return for mold and damage" when the agreement was first signed. If not, according to commercial customs, the price must be low, and we have no complaints against our American friends. If the quantity of materials is so large, the transportation is so difficult, and the time delayed is certainly long, even good things can become moldy and rotten.

The person in charge should handle this situation quickly, otherwise, they will be responsible for the delay. However, canned goods turning into stones is a serious matter. It is a kind of fraud of swapping and stealing, which is unforgivable.

A popular saying, used to describe people who use any means to get money, says: "Strip the clothes off a dead man!" Swapping relief cans with stones, its viciousness and ruthlessness are no different from stripping the clothes off a dead man.

### Where Has the Kwantung Army Gone? Who is Performing Magic?

— Gan Lai

On the 21st of this month, Representatives Hillendon and Sikes, members of the U.S. House Armed Services Committee, proposed that the U.S. government compel the Soviet Union to explain the mysterious disappearance of one million Japanese soldiers in Northeast China.

This news item will probably remain unanswered for the time being. Let us briefly recall the situation of the Japanese troops stationed in Northeast China in the past: 29,000 people, of which Japanese (including military and civilians) accounted for 566,000. During the War of Resistance, the Japanese government prepared 1.3 million "comfort bags" in 1940 to distribute to Japanese soldiers stationed in China, of which 800,000 were planned to be distributed to the Japanese army in North China, Central China, and South China, and the rest were given to the Northeast garrison, indicating that the total number of the Kwantung Army stationed in Northeast China at that time was at least 500,000.

According to a Tokyo dispatch from the Kyodo News Agency on August 5th of this year: "According to Mr. Toyama Jiro, a Japanese who returned to Fukuoka from a certain country on the 3rd of this month, he stated: Originally belonging to the Gando Garrison Motor Transport Unit, he was sent to Posiet, a certain country, in early October last year, and then sent to Komsomolsk, a northern city in Siberia, to perform labor. His unit consisted of 10,000 people, and the other ten receiving camps held between 80,000 and 100,000 soldiers from the Kwantung Army. The 'certain country' is quite generous, with Japanese prisoners receiving special food three to five times a day and being allowed to bathe daily. If their work efficiency exceeds 50%, their dinner ration is also increased. Komsomolsk is a barren land, and the local farmers receive food that is even worse than that of the Japanese prisoners, so it is unexpected that the Japanese prisoners can receive such preferential treatment. The main work is digging holes and laying water pipes, working eight hours a day."

Let's Look Back at Old Accounts

After the Russo-Japanese War, Japan, according to the peace treaty of September 1905 and the Sino-Japanese Supplementary Treaty of December of the same year, was allowed to station troops along the South Manchurian Railway, with no more than 15 soldiers per kilometer. This Japanese army stationed in Northeast China was called the "Manchurian Garrison Army," and it had the strength of one division, which was the predecessor of the "Kwantung Army." In 1906, the army further expanded with the "Railway Guard Unit" and the "Ryojun Fortress Command," "Heavy Artillery Battalion," totaling about 20,000 people, all under the command of the "Kwantung Army Headquarters." Later, it continued to increase its troop strength, stationed in Changchun, Fushun, Ryojun, Gongzhuling, Sinuiju, Dashiqiao, and other places, engaging in the deployment of bases for military aggression. The "September 18th Incident" was launched under the leadership of General Honjo Shigeru, commander of the Kwantung Army. After the Japanese army occupied the entire Northeast, it greatly increased its troops and actively implemented immigration. According to the statistics bureau of the "Manchukuo" Foreign Ministry in 1933, "Manchuria" had a total of 3,090,000 residents.

Shadows Disappear

After Japan surrendered, the whereabouts of these more than 500,000 Kwantung Army soldiers became a mystery. Before the surrender, the main locations of the Kwantung Army were Shenyang, Gongzhuling, Tieling, Liaoyang, Andong, and Lianshanguan. When our army went to take over the above-mentioned locations, not even a trace of a Japanese soldier could be seen.

Could these invasive wolves and tigers, the Kwantung Army whose crimes are unforgivable, have been taken away like those industrial equipment in Northeast China?

Japanese Women Seeking Husbands

Our neighboring country's "Imperial Army" has finally been located, and it is said that they are "receiving preferential treatment." As "defeated generals," they are naturally a little "flattered"; it is a pity that they cannot hear the voices of their parents, wives, and daughters in their homeland organizing "husband-seeking groups" and "father-seeking groups," kneeling and crying. Even the "heroes" who were once habitually murderous, would probably shed a few heroic tears if they heard these cries now.

However, we want to ask: "Politicians" who are full of anti-fascist rhetoric, you took away the machines and also took away the Japanese prisoners, what kind of magic are you playing?

### The Mystery of Japanese Prisoners

— Suo Bei

Last year, after all the Japanese troops in the country were disarmed, the comrades in Yan'an broadcast that there were still armed Japanese soldiers in Nanjing. At that time, a Nanjing newspaper ran a headline saying: "Yan'an Says There Are Armed Japanese Soldiers in Nanjing, Do Nanjing People Believe It?" Readers all laughed at the Communists' clumsy fabrication of rumors.

At that time, no one paid attention to this rumor offensive; unexpectedly, now there is another bloody fact to answer right and wrong: Who is unscrupulously using Japanese prisoners and giving them preferential treatment? Who are the husband-seeking groups in Tokyo crying out to?

The effect of these facts is nothing more than that many people already feel that they dare not listen to the broadcasts and pamphlets of Yan'an as human speech!

The most terrible thing in the world is flowery pamphlets!

### Tears of Youth

— Rui Yun

I want to cry out loud and happily, although others may think that I should be celebrating greatly.

My name is on the list, I'm not seeing things, I've been admitted to the Electrical Engineering Department of a certain National University.

Two years of longing, two years of imagining, today it has finally come true, and my heart is filled with uncontrollable joy. Friends come to congratulate me, colleagues come to admire me, they all know that I have been working in the industry for two years after dropping out of school, and they deeply understand my pain of being out of school from my words and deeds in the past. They say that I can finally satisfy my desire for knowledge and solve the pain of being out of school from now on.

I hurried home and told my parents the news very excitedly. As usual, they should share my joy.

However, unexpectedly, my mother quickly turned her face away, took out a handkerchief from her pocket and wiped her tears on her face, and my father lowered his head and remained silent for a long time. The air in the room was a little suffocating.

"Originally, a father should feel so happy and honored to hear that his son has been admitted to a national university! But your parents are old, and your only brother has left us to pursue his own personal enjoyment... Alas!" My father's voice trembled a little. "You should still go to study! Don't let us hinder your future, but after the public funding is canceled, who will bear your living expenses when you study?" My father's withered hands rested on my shoulders, and I accidentally looked up and saw that his eyes were wet.

"Don't worry about us, go ahead and work hard! We will always find a way," my father was silent, and I saw his gray and thin back slowly moving closer to the window.

What should I answer?

I want to cry out loud and happily!

### An Eight-Year-Old Becomes a Father—Not a Monster

According to the Shen Bao report on the 23rd of this month, an eight-year-old child and a nine-year-old child bride in a farmer's family in Jianjian Village, Qixian County, Hebei Province, gave birth to a boy. In the countryside, isn't this a strange thing! Some places may even chop this child to death, saying that he is a monster. In fact, both of these children are precocious and have nothing to do with gods and monsters.

In general, people who are extremely precocious have a particularly strong sexual desire and have a large amount of gonadal endocrine secretions. Ordinary people's testicles or ovaries are a pair, but there are also humans with three gonads. This pair of men and women probably belong to this category.

This strange sexual phenomenon can be attributed to the excessive development of the testicles or ovaries, because the secretion of sex hormones is exuberant, which promotes the precociousness of all sexual behaviors. If surgery is performed to remove part of the particularly large testicles or ovaries, they may be able to develop normally.

However, this kind of castration is not possible in ordinary people. It is impossible to slow down development, increase lifespan, and castrate.

However, sexual transplantation is possible. Originally, the distinction between sexes is common but not absolute. Men and women are not absolutely different individuals. For example, "hermaphrodites" have testicles and ovaries and are neutral individuals. If they are absolute hermaphrodites, surgery can be performed to remove their testicles or ovaries to make them a woman or a man.

In human blood, due to the regulation of the pituitary gland, two kinds of sex hormones are flowing; for example, male urine can sometimes find female sex hormones. Conversely, female urine also contains male sex hormones.

If the ovaries of apes are transplanted into castrated women, their effectiveness can only be maintained for about a year; if female characteristics are incomplete, female hormones can be injected to cure them. Like the pair of children in Qixian County, their gonads not only do not need to inject any hormones, but on the contrary, they secrete too much, which promotes the abnormal development of sexual function and early childbirth.

There is really no need to be alarmed by these things!

### The Emperor Wenchang Changes Position

Applying to schools is difficult because there are many people and few schools. The first hurdle is the difficulty of registration, and the second hurdle is the difficulty of the exam; but it was never expected that the third hurdle would be the difficulty of announcing the results. After taking the school exam, the results are not announced for a long time, and a worry is always lingering. Although taking the exam does not necessarily mean being accepted, there should always be an outcome whether you are accepted or not! Some people say that the reason for not announcing the results after the papers have been graded is to give an opportunity to "seek connections." Therefore, those who are able (and can seek connections) are shrinking their bodies and sneaking in one by one; what about those who have no connections to seek? They are stretching their necks and looking at the list without seeing it!

In the Qing Dynasty, one had to pay to "buy" the title of Xiu Cai. Someone asked Jin Shengtan: "If you have to pay to take the exam, what should you do?" Jin Shengtan replied: "Replace the statue of Emperor Wenchang in the Confucius Temple with the God of Wealth!" But I don't know what the statue of Emperor Wenchang should be replaced with in the current examination situation?

Of course, the "God of Wealth" is not useless, like the example of 300,000 for a piece of exam paper. However, this matter does not seem to be very "fragrant." The best thing is to engage in commerce, which is "substantial" and "upright."

### Random Notes After Teaching

— w·w

Public school teachers live a hard life. I am careful and take out a banknote, and I have to do some quick mental arithmetic. I won't even let the tram conductor pass if he gives me ten cents less in change. The reason for this is that the income is too low and the expenses are never enough; small debts are still manageable, but what if they pile up! However, let's open our eyes and take a look, and open our ears and listen: "Old Liu failed..." "Three missing one, hurting Yin Zhi." "Come on, let's play a game, set up a fortune-telling stall, doing it occasionally is harmless..." "Mr. ×, advance me ten dollars, I'll win it back today and pay it back tomorrow." But it is difficult to be confused, and we can't always procrastinate. We play today, we play tomorrow. In addition to the "day session" and "night session" on Sundays, there is also a so-called "early session." Bamboo gentlemen often have "fellow travelers," which is really unfortunate! Two years ago, I was also a person who worked hard day and night, I accepted every invitation and went to every game, which made me feel tired and left me penniless. Thinking about it, it really shouldn't have been like that! After thinking carefully, I work as a teacher and teach every day, and I have to take care of the test papers. How much time is left? We often need activities during our leisure time, but we need reasonable activities that are beneficial to our body and mind. There are many so-called recreational activities besides browsing the garden, people research meetings, and discussions. Playing golf, fishing by the sea... these are of course not allowed by the environment; however, taking a short break in the park, enjoying valuable films and dramas, watching exhibitions, listening to music... are all fun. Although it is said that money is vulgar, it is worth spending it if there is a harvest. If you say that the purpose of visiting the bamboo forest is to vainly hope to increase income, then that is absolutely unacceptable. What do you think, fellow teachers?

### Silhouette of General Fu Zuoyi

A General Who Always Sits in the Town of Suiyuan

Reading the poignant telegram that Fu Zuoyi sent to Mao Zedong on the 22nd reminded me of this old general who is over fifty years old.

Over the years, he has been fighting in the wind and sand. He has always been diligent and conscientious in sitting in the town of Suiyuan, where he has spent more than a dozen years. Therefore, the people of Suiyuan have an indelible good impression of him.

By observing his behavior from childhood, one can determine what kind of person he is. During the Xinhai Revolution, he was only a middle school student who had not completed his education. Dissatisfied with reality and in pursuit of new ideals, he resolutely joined the ranks of the Xinhai Revolution. Although he had never received military training, he participated in the Battle of Niangziguan. This kind of courage is rare for any young person. Later, the success of the Xinhai Revolution gave him infinite comfort and encouragement. In 1917, he entered the 5th term of the Baoding Military Academy and graduated the following year. From then on, he officially put on his military uniform and took on tasks in the military.

In the ten years after leaving Baoding, the achievements of successive battles led to his rapid promotion from a platoon leader to a lieutenant general commander of the Tianjin Garrison Command and commander of the 43rd Division. Among the many generals who came from Baoding, he can be considered one of the most successful.

In 1931, Yan Xishan, chairman of Shanxi Province, believed that Suiyuan was a barrier to the Northwest and that foreign troubles and bandits might invade from time to time. Therefore, he had to select the best talent to take on the important task of guarding Suiyuan. After thinking about it, he recommended Fu Zuoyi to take charge of Suiyuan Province. Therefore, Fu became the chairman of Suiyuan Province.

After he took office in Suiyuan, due to the circumstances, he was constantly reminding himself. After the "September 18th Incident," the Japanese invaders gradually encroached. Finally, in 1932, Jehol Province was in crisis, and the large county of Chahar East declared independence in the name of autonomy; at this point, the position of Suiyuan became even more important. At that time, in the face of an extremely difficult mission, he did not hesitate to work hard, training troops day and night and integrating with the people, and prepared to go to war at any time. As a result, the enemy's conspiracy was crushed.

After the outbreak of the Lugouqiao Incident, Liu Ruming, chairman of Chahar Province, suddenly defected and remained idle, causing General Tang Enbo, who was defending Nankou, to be in urgent need of support on the flank. Therefore, he urgently transferred the garrison in Suiyuan to support, but Liu refused to let them pass through. Fu immediately sent telegrams to Liu Ruming to explain the misunderstanding, but there was no result. Nankou was painfully abandoned. When General Tang retreated to Suiyuan, he and Fu held each other and cried bitterly. The two provinces of Chahar and Suiyuan also fell at this point!

After the fall of Suiyuan Provincial City, Fu, in the name of deputy commander of the war zone, led his brave soldiers to defend the country. Later, he was promoted to commander of the 12th War Zone. He always sat in the town of Suiyuan, stood on the front line and fought with the enemy. For eight years, he fought in the icy and snowy land, and he went through all kinds of hardships. He was really a hard-working general.

Last year, the War of Resistance against Japan was quietly coming to an end. The Communist army fired the first shot of the civil war and attacked Fu Zuoyi. At that time, he sent telegrams to Zhu De and Mao Zedong asking them to stop it: on the other hand, he sent telegrams to Chairman Chiang explaining the situation and hoping not to expand it into a civil war; however, the Communist army accused Fu of creating a civil war. Fu immediately declared his position and published the details, and declared that he was willing to resign from all military posts after the victory to express his loyalty to the country.

Now, the Communist army is re-enacting the tragedy of a year ago, so General Fu once again sent a telegram advising Mr. Mao Zedong not to do anything unscrupulously! We are all moved after reading General Fu's telegram. We love generals like Fu who care about the people, but we also hope that the comrades of the Chinese Communist Party will no longer use the means of "creating poverty" to achieve their goal of seizing power!
