### The General Situation is Depressed Without New Developments: Special Envoy Marshall and Zhou Enlai Have Not Yet Met; Ambassador Stuart Plans to Visit the Chairman Soon

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 31st Telegram] Marshal Ma has not yet invited Zhou Enlai for a meeting today. His residence is also quiet. In the reception room of the Communist Party delegation, visitors waiting for news are filled with a heavy atmosphere. Everyone wonders whether Marshal Ma has any mission or opinion at all, and why he came down the mountain so suddenly. If he does have opinions, why hasn't he arranged to meet Zhou Enlai? According to precedent, Marshal Ma always conveys the results to the Communist Party after contacting the government. According to observers: today's situation shows signs of deterioration. The changes in Yunnan are not due to what Marshal Ma brought from Lushan. On the contrary, they were caused by the opinions of the Communist Party that Marshal Ma brought to Lushan. The success of the negotiations depends on the concessions of both sides. However, now that the government has repeatedly made concessions, it still has not promoted the reopening of political negotiations, which must have its reasons. Therefore, some people speculate that the opinions submitted by the Chinese Communist Party to Marshal Ma for transmission to the government must have exceeded the limits that the government can tolerate and concede. These rumors are not groundless. Today, there is also an unusual event: Marshal Ma invited American journalists for a meeting at noon, reportedly to solicit their opinions on the current situation in China. However, the whole thing is kept secret, and outsiders have no way to find out. Even the American journalists who attended the meeting were forbidden to send telegrams or disclose any opinions. Therefore, everyone believes that this gathering is the most thought-provoking event in the current depressed atmosphere.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 31st Telegram] It is said that Marshal Ma will return to Lushan within a few days. According to someone, Marshal Ma's return is possible because Ambassador Stuart has been away from Nanjing for a long time, and no one is taking care of the embassy affairs. Moreover, transportation is very convenient, so he is returning to Nanjing for a trip, which may not be related to the negotiations. According to someone's speculation, the situation may not have deteriorated so drastically.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 31st Telegram] After Marshal Ma returned to Nanjing, the National Government's Staff Officer Pi visited him at eight o'clock this morning, but did not meet him. In the morning at ten o'clock, Mr. Brucker, Counselor of the American Embassy, visited to inquire about Ambassador Stuart's illness. At 6:15 PM, Dean Long Yun also visited for an hour. According to the Communist Party, although Zhou Enlai has not received an invitation by telephone, Zhou will decide to visit him on the 1st on his own initiative. It is also heard that Marshal Ma's return to Nanjing this time is due to the issue of the American army in Tianjin. He plans to handle it in Nanjing.

[Our Newspaper, Guling, 31st Telegram] Ambassador Stuart's condition has improved. This morning, he had beef juice. The Chairman's attending physician and the American military doctor both emphasized that the ambassador needs to rest urgently. Reporters stationed in Guling from various Shanghai newspapers came to the American Embassy to express their concern about the ambassador's condition today. Ambassador Stuart told his secretary on the afternoon of the 31st: His illness has recovered, and he feels uneasy about resting himself while others are working hard. Therefore, he hopes to get up and visit the Chairman on the 1st. He expressed his willingness to sacrifice himself and serve the world, humanity, and the two countries, China and the United States. Although the doctor's orders still require him to rest for three to five days, if possible, he will definitely visit Chairman Chiang on the 1st and have the first formal meeting after coming to Guling again.

[Central News Agency, Guling, 31st Telegram] Chen Fang, Director of the National Government's Political Affairs Bureau, told reporters today that he denied that the three-person meeting would be moved to Guling.

### Although the Communist Army Launched a Full-Scale Offensive, the Government Will Not Give Up Peace: Minister Peng Answers Questions from Foreign Reporters

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st Telegram] A reception for foreign reporters was held at 4:30 AM on the 31st, presided over by Minister Peng Xuepei and Vice Minister Liu Kai. The following is a transcript of Minister Peng's answers: (1) Regarding the military situation: In northern Jiangsu, contact is maintained north of Gaoyou. The Communist army's attack on Luhe has been repelled. The National Army has advanced to Tianchang and north of Xuyi. In northern Anhui, the Communist army's attack on the west of Suining has been repelled. Sixian and Wuhe are in the hands of the National Army. In Shanxi, the Communist army concentrated ten regiments to attack Datong. (2) Regarding the political situation: Because their army began a full-scale offensive, peace negotiations made no progress. In addition to military activities, the Chinese Communist Party continued various destructive actions, such as destroying railways and economic blockades. This policy is what the German-language newspapers in China call "rule or chaos." However, the government will not give up its efforts to resolve the issue peacefully. (3) Regarding Gu Weijun's speech in the United States: I have not seen the original text. I am unable to comment, but the term "civil war" should not be used to describe the current situation in China. To put it correctly, one side is the Chinese Communist Party, which is attempting to seize power by force, but its military strength is inferior. Therefore, it adopts various strategies, such as mass propaganda, psychological warfare, and economic blockade to disrupt transportation, in order to create the greatest chaos and increase the chances of a communist revolution. The other side is the Chinese government, which is trying its best to find a political solution, but cannot avoid the responsibility of maintaining domestic security and order. When attacked, it must resist. For example, the conflict in Shandong was caused by the Communist Party's occupation of Dezhou during the truce. The conflict in northern Jiangsu was due to the Communist army's attack on Taixing. Every time the National Army resists the Communist army's attack, the Chinese Communist Party will shout loudly that a "civil war" has begun. Three days ago, more than 300 Communist army soldiers in plain clothes ambushed the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway. The government sent troops to disperse them. I know that the Chinese Communist Party will accuse the government of "civil war." The other day, the Communist army opened fire on American Marines on the Pingjin Highway, causing many deaths and injuries. The National Army's guard troops rushed to attack them. This will again be evidence of "civil war." (4) Regarding the Communist army's attack on American naval personnel on the Pingjin Highway, the government has received a preliminary report. We are deeply shocked by this atrocity. We will thoroughly investigate and punish this unfortunate incident, which clearly shows the Chinese Communist Party's concept of democracy and the protection of human rights.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st Telegram] Minister Peng Xuepei is scheduled to fly to Xunyang tomorrow morning and then go to Guling.

### He Yingqin's Speech in the United States: The CCP is Unwilling to Obtain Peace Quickly; Attacks on the American Army are to Sabotage Transportation

[Our Newspaper] San Francisco Radio: Washington News: General He Yingqin said that when he went to the Northeast for inspection, he found that the Soviet Union had transported all the machines and materials in the aircraft and automobile factories. However, he was unwilling to disclose the figures of what the Soviet Union had taken away. The ambush of the US Marines by the Communist army between Pingjin had no other meaning except to sabotage highway transportation. Their army tried to destroy highways and railways to hinder China's restoration and to overwhelm the government with problems. He also accused the CCP of being unwilling to reach a peace agreement quickly, saying that their failure to comply with the military reorganization plan was clear evidence. The CCP still does not intend to reduce its troops to the minimum limit stipulated in the agreement in January of this year. So far, the government knows that the CCP's weapons are mostly obtained domestically. When asked if the Communist army could occupy Shanghai, he replied: "No."

[United Press, Washington, 30th Telegram] General He Yingqin pointed out today that the CCP wants to create a state of no good elements in order to take the opportunity to overthrow the government and establish an authoritarian regime. He said: The CCP's attempt is very obvious, that is, to destroy the national economy, prevent the United States from mediating China's disputes, and overthrow the government based on the so-called proletarian dictatorship theory. When asked about Madame Sun Yat-sen's statement that "Chinese and American reactionaries are trying to create a conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union," he said: "Madame Sun Yat-sen has taken an anti-government attitude since 1928. I believe her observations are only her personal opinions." He also said: He believes that the US military must remain in China until the Japanese army is completely disarmed and repatriated.

### The Ninth Group in Laohekou Completed a Mediation Agreement; It Has Been Sent to the Military Mediation Department Awaiting Approval

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 30th Telegram] The Ninth Group of the Military Mediation Department, which was previously reported missing in Xi'an, is now in Laohekou. In their long silence, they have completed a mediation agreement on the conflict between Li Xiannian's troops and the National Army. The content roughly stipulates that the Communist army will no longer advance, and the National Army will no longer pursue. Both sides will withdraw about ten miles from the current conflict line, and there are also provisions for the food supply of Li Xiannian's troops. This agreement has now been sent to the Military Mediation Department, awaiting approval from the three members. However, whether this agreement can be implemented is still a question, because the radio telegrams sent by the group to Li Xiannian in Laohekou have not received a reply, and formal contact has not been established. The group and the Thirty-second Group are expected to return to Beiping in early next month to report everything to the Military Mediation Department.

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 31st Telegram] Regarding the previous report of the disappearance of the Ninth Executive Group, according to news, the group was originally scheduled to fly to Xi'an with the Thirty-second Group on the 25th of this month. Later, in order to make a final effort, it was temporarily decided to stay in Laohekou for two days to wait for Li Xiannian's representative. If Li still stubbornly ignored them, Hankou would send a plane to take the group to Xi'an. However, the Thirty-second Group did not bring telecommunications equipment, so it lost contact with the Ninth Group on the 25th. The previous report was due to this. Also, as of yesterday, Li's representative had not yet arrived, and the Ninth Group is scheduled to fly to Xi'an tomorrow.

### The British Ambassador Can Only Arrive in Nanjing Today

In addition to some deaths and injuries, three American soldiers are missing. The Twenty-fifth Group, which was sent to investigate the area, has not yet been able to depart today.

### People's Self-Defense Training Completed; Jinan's Defense is Solid and People are at Ease; However, the Economic Future is Extremely Precarious

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 31st] Shandong's situation has prompted the National Army's strong self-defense due to the Communist army's repeated and widespread attacks. Coupled with the close cooperation of the party, government, and military, it was finally able to overcome the crisis of shock and waves. Although Jinan now hears the whistle of martial law declared every night, the people's hearts are calm, and there is no more panic. Compared to the previous month, when the Communist army launched a national attack, it was already a world apart. The city's people's self-defense training has been completed, further strengthening the people's confidence in ensuring local security. The preservation of coal mine areas and the fuel problem have been resolved, and the provincial capital, which has been dark for a long time, can shine brightly in recent days. Jinan has not heard any news of mediation for several days. The Seventh Executive Group is currently in Qingdao, and the date of the on-site survey along the Jiaoji Railway has not yet been determined. Jinan's foreign Communist army continues to invade, and the National Army is firmly defending its positions, without being invaded. However, Jinan has been besieged for a long time, the source of supplies has been cut off, and prices have soared, higher than the national average. Shops and factories are losing money and cannot support themselves, and the economy is in a state of exhausting the pond to catch fish, and the future is extremely precarious. The refugees fleeing from the Communist-controlled areas are still increasing. Although the local government has exhausted its efforts, it cannot solve the relief problem. Tragedies such as selling wives and children and suicides among the refugee population are often heard. They are all because their property has been confiscated and their lives have been cut off. If the central government does not provide rapid rescue, more serious consequences will definitely occur. According to the refugees, the Communist army's "struggle" policy in the "liberated areas" has indeed lost the hearts of the people.

The reporter returned disappointed. Today, the World Daily published a letter from Sun Zhongyuan to Li Zongren, saying that he wanted to go home very much and hoped that Director Li would issue a passport to return to Sichuan. The original letter is as follows: "Director Li, I have been distressed after the illness, and because of the many family affairs, I was angry for a while and lived in a friend's house to recuperate. Newspapers have been reporting various rumors these days, which have almost caused political disputes. The guilt is very deep, so I would like to return to my hometown in the near future and continue to run my business. I will never engage in illegal activities. For my own safety, please find a way to protect me and ask you to issue a passport to return to Sichuan. Sincerely yours, Sun Zhongyuan, July 29"

### Protecting Overseas Chinese Is an Urgent Priority

At a time when the government has been slow to protest the Shibuya incident in Japan, where Japanese police shot and killed our Taiwanese compatriots, relations between Indonesia and overseas Chinese are becoming increasingly tense. Dismembered and beheaded bodies of overseas Chinese have been discovered in Medan, gruesome and shocking. Meanwhile, over a hundred thousand overseas Chinese in northern Vietnam are also caught in Vietnamese-French conflicts, and innocent people are suffering. The Vietnamese authorities frequently arrest overseas Chinese, arbitrarily confiscate banknotes, and prohibit the circulation of Eastern-Asian Bank notes. They also impose extra taxes on goods of Chinese merchants. All kinds of oppressive behaviors cause the overseas Chinese to suffer great losses. Since the War of Resistance Against Japan, because of the war's impact, overseas Chinese have lost their fortunes, been displaced, and died in the thousands. Just as they thought that victory in the War of Resistance, the collapse of the powerful, and the rise of China's international status would allow them to resettle and live in peace, the overseas Chinese in Siam were immediately subjected to massacres; the bloodstains in the Dutch East Indies had not yet dried when the Shibuya incident in Japan occurred. In July, when the Philippines became independent, our special envoy Gan Naiguang went to the Philippines to attend the celebrations. Before a treaty and a commercial agreement could be concluded, the Philippine government suddenly promulgated retail and labor laws, imposing severe blows to the livelihood of overseas Chinese. After these incidents happened one after another, the killings and oppression in Indonesia and Vietnam are being repeated with increasing intensity.

The importance of overseas Chinese to the motherland is well known. In the past, they helped the revolution, compensated for foreign losses, and donated to the War of Resistance, not to mention. Even now, when China's imports from January to May have reached 200 billion yuan, and the national economy is seriously affected, overseas Chinese, despite struggling in the face of economic depression, continue to remit money back to the country. Their loyalty to the motherland is even more worthy of our admiration and gratitude. However, the motherland's government has not effectively met their minimum two requirements, the maintenance of life and the protection of property, which is somewhat irresponsible!

If we were to say that the Chinese government intentionally shirked its responsibility, that would of course not be true. The government has not failed to think about helping them and protecting them. But the government is suffering from two major root causes that have led to the tragic fate of overseas Chinese today: first, procrastination, and second, weakness. Whenever a massacre occurs, the government fails to take active action. All procedures are merely formalities, starting with investigation, then reporting, and finally considering. By the time a protest is lodged, the corpses have turned cold, the storm has passed, and the negotiations are nothing more than perfunctory. At most, they issue an apology, say "regret," and make a statement guaranteeing that the same incident will not happen again, which is considered good. However, the same incident is bound to continue to happen soon. Regarding the laws oppressing overseas Chinese, the government is also procrastinating and lethargic, even too lazy to lodge a protest, thinking that it is better not to protest than to protest in vain. This habit of procrastination is the same internally as it is externally. The decline in the efficiency of all administrative affairs of the government in recent years is due to this "drag" tactic! And our overseas Chinese have suffered greatly from our government's "procrastination" disease.

Weakness is an even more harmful root cause than procrastination! Procrastination may be forgivable under certain circumstances, but weakness is absolutely inexcusable. In the past, because the country was weak and surrounded by powerful neighbors, it could be said that a weak country has no diplomacy. Although China cannot now be truly considered a strong country, it is still one of the victorious nations, and at least nominally ranks among the five or six strong countries in the international community. We should no longer harbor any inferiority complex towards the victorious strong nations. But why are we still so cautious, tolerating humiliation, and afraid to speak a few harsh words to Siam, which aided the evildoers, France, whose Vichy government caused evil consequences, and the Vietnamese government in the colony, Japan, the criminal of all mankind, the Philippines, which has just gained independence, and the tyrannical Indonesia? A person has dignity, and a country has national dignity. If China continues like this, our national dignity will be disgraced by lightweight diplomats.

If it is said that the government's reach is limited and it cannot use force as a backup, so negotiations are difficult, that is not true either? When the massacre of overseas Chinese occurred in Siam, our troops in Vietnam could have stationed troops on the border as a backup. Instead, we acted humbly, moved our table to the other side, and sent envoys to negotiate. The Siamese government invited them to live in the palace, held grand banquets, and did their best to prevaricate. However, as soon as the envoys left the palace, the tragedy of the massacre was staged in the streets. Why does the government still have to give in? The French government in Vietnam only occupies a few important cities, and the Vietnamese government's power has only reached the whole of Vietnam. Why do the troops stationed in Vietnam only negotiate with the French government, only know to cooperate meekly with the French government, and not establish a detailed treaty with the Vietnamese government? Why did the government immediately and quickly withdraw its troops, leading to the current suffering of the overseas Chinese?

Procrastination and weakness are undoubtedly the biggest diseases of the Chinese government today and are the root cause of all internal and external problems. For example, in the issue of the Nationalists and Communists, after the victory, the government allowed the Communist army to occupy and invade, expand its troops on a large scale, and poison the people. Negotiations were delayed again and again, yielding again and again, until the situation became unmanageable today. It was still impossible not to make a decision to lift the threat to the capital. However, the lives and property of millions of citizens have been lost and have been plunged into deep water. Transportation is disrupted, cargo cannot be transported, industry and commerce are declining, and foreign goods are dumped, creating a phenomenon that the economy is about to collapse. And those who are fond of war and strife have their glib tongues and attribute all the responsibility to the government. Isn't this caused by procrastination and weakness? In the Spring and Autumn period, when Duke Zhuang of Zheng defeated Gongshu Duan, later commentators still said that Gongshu Duan certainly deserved his blame, but Duke Zhuang's indulgence of him beforehand could not escape the censure of the wise. Therefore, procrastination and weakness are by no means a proper solution.

There is a Chinese idiom: "Kind but not martial, nothing can be done." Today, the intention of the Chinese government is really too "kind," but all the insults are due to a lack of martial spirit. "Martial" does not necessarily mean using troops, but it means being firm and decisive, not fearing the strong, doing what should be done, never being perfunctory, and eradicating all habits of inertia, weakness, and listlessness. For example, punishing corruption, curbing violence, and levying taxes on wartime profiteers, these major events related to the national economy and the people's livelihood should all be decided promptly. However, the current government cannot demonstrate its martial virtue. Today, the central government has been entrusted by the 450 million people of the Chinese nation and is responsible for protecting the lives and property of 15 million overseas Chinese. It should strive to achieve something and wash away the past malpractices. We hope that the government will quickly come up with solutions to stabilize domestic order and protect overseas Chinese.

### Australian Representative Evatt Defends Small Nations at Peace Conference Yesterday; Drafting of Peace Treaty Should Be Based on Principles of Justice; Molotov Claims Potsdam Declaration Must Be Fulfilled

[This Newspaper] London, 31st (Radio): The second plenary session of the Peace Conference was held in Paris this afternoon. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov delivered a speech lasting 15 minutes, the main points of which were as follows: (1) All countries must uphold the prestige of the Council of Foreign Ministers and must not undermine its resolutions. (2) The Potsdam Declaration must be strictly fulfilled.

[This Newspaper] Paris, 31st (Radio): The head of the Australian delegation to the European Peace Conference, Evatt, delivered a speech today, stating that the five great powers should not forget the common victory won by the other sixteen countries after achieving victory. Australia is an example of these sixteen countries. In the same generation, we have twice crossed the ocean to campaign in Europe, making great sacrifices for the common victory. In six years, we fought simultaneously against Germany, Italy, and Japan in Europe, the Far East, North Africa, and the Mediterranean, with battle zones spanning the globe. Evatt also said: We should not ignore the heroic resistance of the people of Greece, New Zealand, Africa, and Canada. Victory was achieved through the efforts of all Allied nations, so they should be given the same active right to participate in the common peace that belongs to all countries. He argued that the Paris Peace Conference should not be merely consultative in nature but should grant all countries genuine and effective participation rights. Therefore, the drafting of peace treaties should belong to all countries, not just three or four major powers. Evatt then cited the speech made by Berners on October 5, 1943, and Molotov's remarks at the London Foreign Ministers' Conference to advocate for the interests of small countries. The Australian representative Evatt then analyzed the principles of drafting the peace treaty, saying that the great powers should not force their will on others based on a spirit of revenge. Our goal is the word "justice." Men, women, old, and young all over the world hope to obtain a peace that is fair to them and their children. If we impose an unjust and excessively humiliating burden on them, we will violate the spirit of democracy, and fascism may make a comeback.

### Heated Debate Erupts in Procedures Committee Over Voting Rights Issue; Soviet Union Insists on Two-Thirds Vote

[This Newspaper] London, 31st (Radio): The Procedures Committee of the Peace Conference continued its meeting at 10:00 a.m. today. Representatives engaged in a heated debate over the voting rights issue.

[This Newspaper] London, 31st (Radio): Molotov accused Australian representative Evatt of "playing some trickery with voting rights." Evatt spoke for a long time, emphasizing that peace is not a local European issue but a global issue, and that World War II was not only fought against Germany but also against Japan. The Netherlands and Australia made great efforts in the war against Japan, and there is no provision in the Potsdam and Moscow conference communiqués for a two-thirds majority vote. The Greek representative and the representatives of small countries were completely united in opposing the two-thirds method. Molotov did not elaborate and told the small countries, "Playing with voting rights may lead to a stalemate in the conference."

[This Newspaper] London, 31st (Radio): Molotov refuted the small countries' opposition to the control of the conference by the four powers, accusing the countries that supported a majority vote of using tricks to gain technical voting rights. He believed that this move would harm the Soviet bloc and benefit the Anglo-Saxon bloc. Molotov cited the argument of the French Socialist Party's newspaper "Popular" to support his argument, saying, "If a majority voting system is adopted, the Anglo-Saxon bloc can steadily obtain twelve or thirteen votes, while the Soviet Union will always be in the minority."

[This Newspaper] London, 31st (Radio): After Molotov finished speaking, an American representative stood up and said that Berners would propose on August 1 that a two-thirds majority vote is required for the vote on major matters.

[United Press, Paris, 31st] The Slavic representative of the Procedures Committee requested that Albania be allowed to be the 22nd country to attend the Peace Conference, on the grounds that Albania was one of the first countries to be invaded by Italy and was ravaged by the invading country. The Dutch representative proposed that the host country France be the permanent chairman of the Peace Conference, rather than the four or five powers taking turns as chairman.

### Unagreed Clauses of Peace Treaty to Be Submitted to General Assembly for Discussion

[Reuters, Paris, 30th] The various contentious clauses of the draft peace treaty that have not yet been agreed upon by the Council of Foreign Ministers were published here tonight and will be submitted to the 21-nation Peace Conference for discussion, including the proposals made by the United States and the Soviet Union regarding the rights of the United Nations in Italian property. The United States proposes that if property within Italy cannot be returned to the people of the United Nations who have suffered losses, Italy should fully compensate them. The Soviet Union proposes that Italy should be required to pay only one-third of the compensation because it was the first to leave the Axis powers. Britain and France have reserved their approval of the U.S. proposal.

[Reuters, Rome, 31st] Some people here advocate that Marshal Badoglio be sent to Paris with the Italian delegation to attend the Peace Conference, so that this person who signed the Italian armistice agreement can confront the Allies, and the Allies will be able to understand their responsibilities.

### Regarding Five-Nation Treaty; Only Nine Nations Will Be Allowed to Sign

[This Newspaper] London, 31st (Radio): Of the 21 countries attending the Paris Peace Conference, only the nine countries that fought against the five defeated countries will be allowed to sign the five-nation treaty, and one of these countries will not sign any country's treaty. The nine countries are Britain, Australia, New Zealand, India, South Africa, the Soviet Union, Byelorussia, Ukraine, and Czechoslovakia. The United States has not fought against Finland, Canada has never declared war on Bulgaria, Yugoslavia and Greece only declared war on the adjacent Axis countries, France, China, and the other five countries only declared war on Italy, and Dai has not declared war on any of the five countries.

### Black People from 48 States of America Surround the Presidential Palace

[Reuters, Washington, 30th] Black people from 48 states of America surrounded the White House today to protest the killing of two black couples in Georgia by white people.

### Bernays Solemnly Declares: America Will Never Revert to Isolation; Guarantees Respect for the Opinions of All Small Nations

[Reuters, Paris, 30th] The Paris Peace Conference convened at 4:00 PM today. First, U.S. Secretary of State Bernays spoke, followed by British Prime Minister Attlee, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Shijie (the full text of his speech is in a separate cable), and others. Tomorrow's meeting will be held at 3:00 PM in the afternoon. The first speaker will be Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, who did not attend today.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 30th] U.S. Secretary of State Bernays delivered his first speech at the Peace Conference this afternoon, stating that those who have engaged in war must forge peace. The United States will abide by the agreements of the Council of Foreign Ministers, but if the representatives of the countries attending this conference present counter-proposals with a two-thirds majority vote, the United States will ensure that the conference considers those counter-proposals. Bernays reminded the audience that the Council of Foreign Ministers, when drafting the final peace treaty, not only allowed for the consideration of proposals made here, but also did not arbitrarily reject any suggestions. Bernays then discussed America's isolationist policy, stating that the United States had unwisely decided to revert to isolationism after the First World War, but now the United States has decided that no matter how difficult the path of international cooperation may be, it will never adopt the same policy again. This statement by Bernays was met with applause. He also opposed long-term, large-scale occupation of countries that have been effectively disarmed, as this is a method of guaranteeing peace, not achieving it.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 30th, United Press] Bernays also declared that the United States, with the support of the United Kingdom, guarantees that it will fully consider the opinions of all small nations. British Prime Minister Attlee also stated that the conference is eager to hear the opinions of the seventeen small nations.

### Peace Conference Miscellany

[Hanguo News Agency, Paris, 31st] A wine stall has been set up at the entrance of the Luxembourg Palace, providing beer and liquor to journalists, and business is booming. Groups of reporters emerge from the conference venue to engage in spirited drinking and conversation at the stall. Whether this boisterous drinking is due to the rising temperature of the conference or the tediousness of the meetings remains for historians to decide.

Many delegates stroll through the floral gardens of the Luxembourg Palace, sipping champagne or exquisite cocktails amidst the colorful blooms, which is also a delightful pastime.

Bernays patronized a common eatery instead of entering the chic restaurants, reflecting his "eat-what-suits-me" approach. Bernays is very particular about his food and drink.

The speeches at the conference were unremarkable, but one lady's hat attracted considerable attention. This lady wore a black hat to the conference hall, adorned with two snow-white doves of peace, which was quite startling.

The conference venue has been meticulously arranged. Six firefighters are stationed on the roof of the Luxembourg Palace day and night to prevent any possible fire.

French veterans and wounded soldiers also joined in the commotion, demanding increased pensions, but so far, they have only managed to block the cars of the delegates attending the conference for a short time.

The cars of the chief delegates are marked with white flags, while the cars of other delegates are marked with red flags, making it easy to tell who is inside.

### British Liberal Party Newspaper Reports: Soviet Government to Reorganize, Molotov to Become Premier

[French News Agency, London, 30th] The British Liberal Party newspaper, "The Star," recently reported that Soviet Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Gusev, could become the next Foreign Minister. Knowledgeable sources are paying close attention to this in Paris, where he is attending the Peace Conference. It is reported that in January of this year, he represented the Soviet Union at the United Nations General Assembly in London, explaining and defending the Soviet Union's views with considerable force, which earned him the trust of the Soviet government. With the death of a government official in the Soviet Union, coupled with Stalin's poor health, a cabinet reshuffle is inevitable. It is speculated that Foreign Minister Molotov will become the Premier, and Ambassador Gusev will succeed him as Foreign Minister. As for Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky, he may withdraw from the diplomatic arena and be appointed as the head of departments related to the reconstruction of the Soviet economy.

### Situation Serious on the Bulgarian-Greek Border

[Reuters, Athens, 31st] A New York Times reporter states: Greece has been attacked by Bulgaria three times in recent decades, so the Greeks are wary of Bulgaria. Bulgaria did not suffer much loss in this war. Recently, rumors have been circulating that Bulgaria has concentrated heavy troops along the Greek border, and that bandits armed with Bulgarian weapons are active in the Plovdiv area. Consequently, farmers in the Greek province of Thrace are quite anxious during this harvest season. There are widespread rumors that Bulgarian troops will invade Greece once British troops withdraw. They point out that Bulgarian troops are very familiar with the terrain there, and the narrowest point from the Bulgarian border to the coast is only twenty miles, so in the event of war, Bulgarian troops could cut off Greece's connection with the province of Thrace in an instant. Therefore, the situation on the Bulgarian-Greek border seems quite serious due to the state of psychological unrest.

### Rumor: United States and Siam Request Withdrawal of Complaint Against Vietnam

To Avoid Impeding U.S.-French Understanding

[United Press, Washington, 30th] According to reliable sources: The U.S. State Department today requested Siam to withdraw its complaint to the United Nations regarding the Siam-Vietnam border issue. Although the motivation for the request has not been officially disclosed, diplomatic circles in Washington believe that the United States needs France's support in Europe to oppose Soviet demands, and therefore, in the current stage of proceedings, it is eager to avoid participating in any disputes that could affect U.S.-French understanding.

### Soviet Prosecutor Also Argues: All German War Criminals Should Be Executed

[United Press, Nuremberg, 30th] Soviet prosecutor Rutunko today argued in court that all twenty-two German war criminals should be sentenced to death, stating that such a verdict would satisfy all of humanity. The various crimes with which the defendants have been charged have been fully proven, and they should now be sentenced to the ultimate penalty without exception.

### Soviet Union's Loan from the United States: Hope for Success Only by Next Year

[United Press, Washington, 30th] Even if the Soviet Union seeks a loan from the United States that is only a fraction of the British loan, it is likely that it must wait until next year for any hope of success. It is reported that the Soviet government is quite interested in borrowing $1 billion from American businesses, but the United States notified Moscow months ago that if the Soviet Union agrees to simultaneously discuss trade relations with the Balkan countries and regions within the Soviet sphere of influence, then the United States would be willing to discuss this loan. Since then, nothing has been heard. Soviet loans must be processed through the Export-Import Bank, unlike British loans, which are paid directly by the Treasury. The Export-Import Bank is a government agency with reserves far below $1 billion. A formal request to increase the Export-Import Bank's fund has not been submitted. Congress is working hard to conclude various cases in preparation for adjournment, so it seems very difficult to take action this year. However, the Soviet Union occupies an important position in the discussions regarding the loan to Britain. Supporters of the loan argue that the $3.75 billion loan can make Britain a strong bulwark against the spread of communism.

### U.S. Rocket Test Breaks Altitude Record

[United Press, White Sands, New Mexico, 30th] Army technicians today set a new record of 104 miles at this testing ground by launching another V-2 rocket invented by Germany (this is the ninth time). The previous record was 20.5 miles. This rocket, launched from here, landed 69 miles northeast, creating a deep hole in the New Mexico desert. The instruments installed in the rocket head were undamaged upon landing. Testers will be able to obtain records of cosmic ray heat and air pressure at the altitude reached by the rocket.

### United States and Britain Behind the Scenes Support Coup in Spain; Franco Likely to Be Forced to Step Down

[French News Agency, London, 30th] The News Chronicle recently reported that the United States and Britain, with the tacit approval of the Vatican, plan to support a coup in Spain in August or September of this year. Generals Aranda and Inglés are preparing everything in London and Washington. At that time, a provisional military government will be established. It is expected that Franco will be unable to offer any resistance and will quietly withdraw from politics. The provisional military government will also hold a referendum to decide on the issue of restoration, and then establish a formal government. Two-thirds of the members of the new cabinet have already been decided. Leaders of the Spanish Republican government have also expressed their support for this plan.

### U.S. Congress to Adjourn Soon; Three Bills Shelved

[United Press, Washington, 31st] Three bills proposed by the U.S. government, intended to strengthen U.S. control over world power politics and bolster U.S. defenses, will be delayed due to Congress's adjournment. Diplomatic authorities state that only one of the bills seems to have a slim chance of passing before Congress adjourns on August 2nd. The other two bills are hopeless. The following three bills have not been passed by either the Senate or the House of Representatives: (1) Authorizing President Truman to send military delegations to any location in the world. (2) Allowing President Truman to assist in training and equipping one million Chinese troops, but only if Special Envoy Marshall facilitates Chinese unity. (3) Allowing President Truman to raise the standards of troops and equipment throughout the Western Hemisphere to strengthen defense.

### British House of Commons Decides to Accept Partition Plan for Palestine; U.S. and British Experts Propose U.S. Funds for Arabs

[This Newspaper] London, 31st Broadcast: The British House of Commons convened today and decided to accept the recommendations of the Anglo-American Committee of Experts on the Palestine issue. Palestine will be divided into four regions: (1) the Jewish Province, (2) the Jerusalem District, (3) the Negev District, and (4) the Arab Province.

[Reuters, Washington, 30th] Authoritative sources: The report of the Anglo-American experts after discussing the Palestine issue in London has been submitted to President Truman, who has forwarded it to the Cabinet for review. It is reported that in addition to recommending the partition of Palestine, the report also suggests that the United States allocate $300 million for the Arab countries to develop their economies, with an additional $50 million specifically for the Arab people of Palestine.

### International Court of Justice to Hear the Issue of Manchukuo

[Kaizosha, Tokyo, 31st] The Far East International Tribunal today summoned Ryohei Kasagi, the former director of the puppet Manchukuo's Council of State, to testify about the establishment of Manchukuo. It is reported that before the Japanese army established the puppet regime of Manchukuo, it first organized the so-called Autonomous Guidance Department. Kasagi, in response to questions from defense attorney Ohara, insisted that the Japanese army organized the Guidance Department to maintain public order, as if the witness had been hired by the defendant. Subsequently, the chief prosecutor presented various documents and evidence related to Japan's invasion of Northeast China. Finally, Mrs. Liu Ai-lin, the prosecutor in charge of the Northeast China issue, presented various documents and evidence of Japan's control over Northeast China, including the "Outline of the Economic Organization Policy for Japan and Manchuria" decided by the Japanese Cabinet on March 31, 1934, which stated that Northeast China's transportation, communications, etc., related to Japan's national defense, should be placed under Japan's real power and properly controlled to accelerate its development. The financial system of Northeast China should also be properly organized to ensure the smooth operation of the financial organizations of Japan and Manchuria. Moreover, Japanese people should be sent to Northeast China as much as possible to provide the technology and labor needed for the development of Northeast China's industries.

Due to congested telecommunications today, a special article on the Palestine issue will be published later.

### Full Text of Foreign Minister Wang's Speech at the Second Plenary Session of the Paris Peace Conference; Emphasizes Two Principles for Creating Peace; Three Points to Note in Peace Treaty Terms

[Central News Agency, Paris, 30th] Wang Shijie, the chief representative of our delegation, stated in his speech at the Second Plenary Session of the Paris Peace Conference this afternoon that China's policy was to emphasize two general principles for the work of creating peace, and three key points regarding the drafting of peace treaties with the former five European enemy countries. Recognizing the great importance of his speech, the Central News Agency reporter is sending the full text for domestic readers to consult. Wang stated: The convocation of this conference is indeed the first concrete step since the collapse of Germany and Japan for humanity to yearn for

Clearing Up the War

and restoring peace. Over the past few months, people around the world have been expecting a sign that would alleviate their worries about the future situation. However, their hopes have been repeatedly dimmed by doubts about whether the conference could be held. Today, the representatives of 21 countries are able to gather together to discuss peaceful solutions. This fact itself is enough to give the world great comfort, and the selection of Paris as the venue for the conference is also very satisfying. Paris, known throughout the world for its love of justice and freedom, will undoubtedly give all the attending representatives infinite inspiration, helping us to complete this important task. The French government has sincerely hosted and facilitated all the delegates, and I would like to express my gratitude on behalf of the Chinese delegation. The Chinese delegation is participating in this conference with an ardent hope for its success. China participated in the Second World War for the longest time, and was the first to resist Axis aggression with arms, and also the last to end armed resistance. Although China did not directly participate in military operations on the European battlefield, we have fully fulfilled our responsibilities in this global war.

China's Resistance War

lasted eight years, and resulted in the loss of tens of millions of lives, which cannot be considered a small sacrifice. In view of the fact that peace is as indivisible as war, China cannot but be concerned about the work of the United Nations in truly establishing peace in any part of the world. There is no doubt that winning peace is no easier than winning war. We all know that proposing conditions and applying them to the defeated countries is one thing, while placing these conditions in a treaty and proving them to be feasible in the long run, so that peace can be sustained, is entirely another. The Chinese delegation firmly believes that it would be most gratifying if all suggestions and proposals, regardless of which delegation they are proposed by, can be accepted and receive the consideration they deserve based on their merits. Moreover, in the discussion of suggestions, we believe that there should be openness and honesty, and the subsequent publicity of these discussions will be very effective in promoting genuine understanding between all countries. Regarding

Peace Terms

I do not wish to comment at this time, but I would like to emphasize two points in particular, because from our perspective, these two points must be given extra attention if the next or subsequent peace conferences are to be successful. First, the victorious nations must abide by the promises they made during the war, as well as the principles they proclaimed. For example, when it comes to mediation and resolving territorial disputes, we must not forget the Atlantic Charter, nor should we limit its implementation. Second, the victorious nations should not propose conditions to the defeated countries that would allow reactionary elements in the defeated countries to make a comeback, thereby depriving democratic forces of any chance of rebirth or consolidation. Based on the above, I would like to briefly clarify the various treaty drafts submitted by the Chinese delegation for the consideration of the conference. First, regarding

Military Treaties

I believe that the drafts have given the United Nations appropriate security guarantees, while also ensuring that the defeated countries do not consider them to be unduly harsh. Moreover, in the case of Italy, its performance during the later stages of the war has already earned recognition. Second, as for the territorial, political, and economic clauses, I believe that the conference should conduct a more thorough discussion of the drafts, because the topics involved have a great impact on the future stability of Europe. Anyone who tries to read these treaty drafts cannot deny that many of the agreements reached are based on mutual compromise. If we can find ways to improve them, it will not be for the narrow interests of any party concerned, but for the broad and universal interests. Such agreements will and should be reached. Third, regarding the issue of Italian colonies, we must recognize that this issue has not yet been resolved. The Chinese delegation believes that the conference must accept certain

Fundamental Principles

as the guide for our search for a final solution. One of these principles should be that some or all of Italy's colonies should be granted independence immediately. If this is not feasible, they should be placed under the trusteeship of the United Nations for a certain period of time, during which preparations for their autonomy and independence should be completed. The impact of this policy will not only be limited to the people of the directly related territories, but will also give some hope and confidence to the millions of people elsewhere who are waiting for the early and full realization of their legitimate aspirations. We who participate in this conference may have differences of opinion, but the common people of all the countries we represent have a common desire, which is that this conference will achieve a genuine and lasting peace. They seem to have a common concern, which is that the governments participating in this conference have not yet been able to cooperate fully in this historically significant endeavor. Finally, I express my hope that the work of the conference will ultimately satisfy the universal aspirations of the common people, and eliminate their worries, so that the peace we create will be a peace for the common people, and not just a peace for government representatives, as some peace settlements have been in the past.

### The Accused He Dekui Continues to Work Diligently in Beijing and Shanghai; Supervising Commissioner Cheng Expresses Concern That This Harms Political Morality; Visited the Municipal Government Yesterday to Inquire for Half an Hour; Supervisory Yuan Decides to Continue Investigation and Handle According to Law

Regarding the case of He Dekui, Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Government, according to yesterday's newspaper reports of Mayor Wu's interview with reporters, he will await orders from the Executive Yuan. It is learned that Jiangsu Supervising Commissioner Cheng Zhongxing, and Supervisory Committee members Fan Zhengbo and Zhang Qingzhen, went to the Municipal Government together at 11:00 AM yesterday morning to inquire with Mayor Wu about the handling of the case and to review relevant case files. Cheng, Fan, and Zhang questioned He Dekui in the Mayor's office for half an hour, and the three left the Municipal Government at 1:00 PM in the afternoon. Reporters inquired about the progress of the investigation at the entrance of the Municipal Government. The response was that the case was very simple, and its nature was a legal issue on one hand and an issue of political morality on the other. The legal aspect should be decided by the court according to the law. As for political morality, based on the evidence provided by Councilor Luo, the time when He Dekui signed the official document at the Municipal Council was June 1942. At that time, the full-scale war between China and Japan had been going on for five years, and the Chinese members of the Municipal Council's board of directors had all withdrawn. The chairman of the board had long been replaced by a Japanese person. He Dekui was a citizen of the Republic of China and should have known the great righteousness and responsibility of a citizen during his country's war against a foreign nation. The recent accusation has resulted in He Dekui diligently working in Beijing and Shanghai, and carrying on with business as usual. His remarks the other day have had a great impact on political morality and official conduct. The Supervisory Yuan will continue to investigate the case and handle it according to law.

### Zhang Zhiben Talks About Cleaning Up the Takeover; Judging Good and Bad, Right and Wrong Based on Evidence; Expresses Determination to Do It Seriously

[This Newspaper] Zhang Zhiben is the most notable figure in Shanghai today. He is the head of the takeover work investigation team. His target is specifically the high-ranking officials who have handled the takeover work since the victory, and the various agencies represented by those high-ranking officials. He wants to investigate how the astronomical number of enemy and puppet properties were taken over, and how they were disposed of. He will accept complaints from anyone in Shanghai and redress their grievances. From these few points, you can see how arduous his task is.

Yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM, this reporter met the 66-year-old elder in Lane 17, Fuxing Middle Road. His silver hair and wrinkled face clearly show how difficult and intractable his work has been over the decades. He has long recognized that this new job requires even more patience and dedication than the Administrative Court. He bravely told reporters: "Since I have taken on this responsibility, I must do it seriously." At the same time, he also explained: "The current supervisory system is completely different from the imperial censor system of the past. We must judge 'good' and 'bad,' 'right' and 'wrong' based on solid evidence. Before understanding the truth, we must never make sweeping criticisms. Everything we do must be in accordance with the 'law.'" The "law" seems to be an inseparable term from him. Director Zhang is a senior figure in the judicial community. In the early years of the Republic of China, he served as the Minister of Justice. In 1927, he served as the Chairman of Hubei Province. The government has always relied on him. During the War of Resistance, he served as the Secretary-General of the Judicial Yuan and the President of the Administrative Court for eight years. The Administrative Court is not an ordinary court. It specifically accepts complaints from ordinary people who are dissatisfied with the actions of government agencies. Mr. Zhang has been doing supervisory work for decades. The general public may still be unfamiliar with him, but few officials in the Republic of China do not know him. Having him lead the investigation in Shanghai, the most complex and convoluted takeover area, is considered by us to be the most ideal choice.

Deadline for Reporting Takeover Situation

The first group of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Area Enemy and Puppet Property Takeover Handling Work Investigation Team has now received more than fifty confidential letters of accusation, and many cases have been filed in person.

In the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), he opened the Yongming Company in Heng Street, Zhuji, and plundered tung oil, castor oil, copper plates, timber, and other resources to supply the enemy. Subsequently, Ando was transferred, and Ikeda succeeded him, but Xue remained willing to curry favor with the enemy.

Civil Affairs Briefing

### This Year's District Production - Internal Regulations for Matters to be Handled

The organizational regulations of the Municipal District Production Committee, consisting of thirteen articles, were drafted and promulgated by the Municipal Government in March of this year, based on Article 5 of the Municipal Organization Law.  Yesterday, a public letter was received from the Ministry of Interior stating: "Investigations have revealed that since 1943, the rear provinces have all followed the 'Township Production Method' and other relevant laws to successively organize township production and have obtained considerable benefits. Since the revised Municipal Organization Law was promulgated, the original method is no longer fully applicable to the municipality. The Ministry has re-drafted the 'Municipal Production Method' and submitted it to the Executive Yuan, which was promulgated and implemented by a clear order on December 15, 1945, and a partial letter was sent to your Municipal Government for reference. Now, with the victory of restoration, it should be continued to be promoted extensively.  According to the Ministry's 1946 work plan, you should immediately urge the districts to handle the following items:

(1) For counties that have implemented township production, the organization of the Township Production Committee under their jurisdiction should be thoroughly investigated to see if it is sound. If there are inappropriate candidates or dereliction of duty, they should be ordered to reorganize according to the law. (2) Counties or townships that have not implemented township production should be urged to implement them universally. (3) Each county should, in accordance with current laws and regulations and actual circumstances, formulate specific measures for raising the land, funds, labor, etc. required for production this year, and order them to be followed. (4) Each county should stipulate the implementation progress and completion deadlines for various production tasks, order them to be implemented in accordance with the prepared production plan, and compile the production situation of each township according to the plan briefing form promulgated by the Ministry, and forward it to the relevant ministries and the Ministry for verification. (5) Each province in the recovered area should immediately draft the organizational regulations of the Township Production Committee and the detailed rules for the implementation of the Township Production Method in accordance with the provisions of the Township Production Method, and report them to the Ministry and relevant ministries for verification and filing. (6) Each municipal government should quickly draft the organizational regulations of the Municipal District Production Committee and the detailed rules for the implementation of the Municipal Production Method in accordance with the Municipal Production Method and the Ministry's previous letter, and report them to the Ministry for verification and filing." The Municipal Government's Civil Affairs Department is now urging the districts to handle them diligently.

### Preferential Treatment for Dependents of Soldiers - Taken Over by the Civil Affairs Department

The Municipal Government Personnel Department originally handled the business of preferential treatment for the families of soldiers who went to war against the enemy in this city. It was resolved at the 40th Municipal Government Meeting last week to be presided over by the Civil Affairs Department. Now, the files of the item have been transferred from the Personnel Department to the Civil Affairs Department. It is also learned that the Provisional Measures for Preferential Treatment of Families of Soldiers Who Went to War Against the Enemy in this city have also been drafted and submitted to the Municipal Government Meeting for revision and approval.

### Foreigners Employing Chinese - No Need to Issue Household Permits

Civil Affairs Department Issues Clear Explanation

The Tenth District (Jing'an) is a residential area in this city, and many foreigners reside in this area. Since this household registration was sorted out, some rations or relief supplies have been issued based on the national identity card or household permit. However, there is no clear regulation as to whether Chinese people and employees residing in foreign households should be issued household permits. The household registration section of the district has specially submitted a request to the Civil Affairs Department of the Municipal Government for explanation. The Civil Affairs Department has replied by letter, excerpts of which are as follows: (1) Chinese people in foreign households who have another residence should be issued household permits by the district office where the residence is located. If there is no other residence and they are employed in a foreign household, there is no need to issue another household permit. (2) For changes in household registration after the household census, the Bao chiefs should be seriously ordered to investigate and fill in the household permits at any time. For households that move in as a whole household, household permits should be issued at the time of application for registration, and the district office should verify the facts and reissue them. The district is now acting accordingly.

### Tenth District Opens Bao Chief Meeting

The Tenth District (Jing'an District) District Office held its first district-wide Bao Chief meeting at 3:00 PM on July 30th at the Ballroom on the second floor of the Paramount Ballroom on Yuyuan Road. Jin Dehuan, the District Chief of the district, and more than forty Bao Chiefs attended.

Regarding other proposals, each Bao Chief expressed opinions and listed them as specific measures, which adjourned until after 6:00 PM.

### Eighteenth District's Re-inspection Completed

Since the Eighteenth District Office began the re-inspection of household registration, the work has been extremely tense, and even more so because the enemy aliens in the territory have been sent back to their country, and each household has moved in. Ordinary civilians have also built sheds on vacant land to live in, and there are many declarations of moving in, which must be clearly investigated. Now the re-inspection work has been completed, and household statistics are being rushed to be submitted to the Municipal Government soon. In addition, the national identity cards of the district have also been fully issued.

### Twentieth District Requests Establishment of Postal Branch

The Twentieth District (Yangshupu), because the district is located in eastern Shanghai and belongs to the factory area, the number of residents has been increasing day by day as various factories have resumed operations one after another. The number of letters to and fro is increasing day by day. Although ordinary letters can be dropped into mailboxes everywhere, express and registered mail must be delivered to the Tilanqiao Post Office, which is far away. The round-trip fare exceeds the postage by several times, and the time lost cannot be estimated. In order to specially request the Municipal Government to transfer the letter to the Postal Administration General Bureau, it is approved to set up a postal branch or agency in the center of the district to benefit the citizens.

### De Fu Foreign Firm Liquidation Nears Completion - Liang Ke Yan Industry Will Feel Difficulty - Shortage of Assorted Goods Will Drive Prices Up

[Our Newspaper] The De Fu Foreign Firm is the largest German enterprise in the Far East. Its Liang materials and Yan materials have a wide sales range, and the quality is also good. The Indanthrene dye, which is known to both women and children, is one of them. After the victory against Japan, the government restored and the Enemy and Puppet Property Processing Bureau set up a liquidation office to manage it. In addition to checking and listing all the inventory of the firm, it was sold in batches. The purchasers must be formal factories and firms. The person in charge, Mr. Cheng, although not familiar with dyes and Yan materials, was still able to handle things carefully. However, the firm's organization was extremely large. Although it was tightened repeatedly after liquidation, the manpower was still inevitably complex. There was a strike by all employees ten days ago, which was quickly quelled. Some employees were concerned that the inventory liquidation would be completed, and they were deeply afraid that their jobs would be in trouble, so they have not been stable. Some factories also hope that they can continue to supply the goods due to the familiarity of the goods. However, the authority of the liquidation office is limited to ending the current business and cannot import goods for the market. The seller and the user both pressed Mr. Cheng to find a way to maintain it in order to achieve a win-win situation. According to the news revealed by the factory industry association, the good quality of De Fu's Liang materials and Yan materials is indeed a fact, but after all, they are enemy properties, so they will inevitably be sold out. As for whether the government should ship goods from Germany to compensate for the war reparations and use them to transfer to industrial use, it is a question of decision and politics that must be seriously considered. Therefore, although some factories requested the association to submit a request to the government, the association has not done so. Recently, the Indanthrene market has risen sharply, and the main reason is this. According to the situation in January and February, the De Fu inventory seems to be running out. According to people in the Yan material industry, assorted goods will rise in price due to shortages in the future. As for the goods on the road, there are American and British goods to supply, so there is no need to panic. The inland dye shops that have always used De Fu brands will feel great difficulty. It is found that there are no less than hundreds of kinds of products of De Fu, which are exclusively sold by Yan material firms under the brand name. The large Yan material firms in this city rely on this for a living. Those who change to their own brand to supply the local customers will be greatly affected in the future. As for Indanthrene, there were originally several kinds of colors, and blue is the most famous one. There are Bao Lin of the American Hengxin Foreign Firm and Clidaton of the British Bu Neimen Foreign Firm to compete with it. If British and American goods are supplied, the dye factories will not be greatly affected, otherwise, they will sit and wait for the dumping of foreign colored cloth, which will increase the industrial crisis again.

The selling price of the city's grain is not allowed to exceed 77,000 yuan per dan. The retail price must not exceed 820 yuan per jin.

### Hua Stock Market is Chaotic - Yong Yarn and Meyer Diverge

The Hua stock market is extremely chaotic. Many large investors are actively shorting Meyer and longing Yong Yarn. The two are diverging. The three small stocks are relatively stable, not as volatile as the two major hot stocks. Yong Yarn first saw a low price of 655 yuan, and then rose to 710 yuan, and finally hovered around the 700 yuan mark. Meyer first mailed a high price of 4,200 yuan, and then fell to below 3,700 yuan. Before closing, it rebounded to above 4,000 yuan. Jingfu rose from a low price of 240 yuan to 265 yuan. Xinguang rose from 235 yuan to 255 yuan. Qinxing rose from 178 yuan to 198 yuan. At noon, they all hovered. The unpopular stocks were still relatively stable. As a result, compared with the previous closing, the rubber band calculated that Yong Yarn rose by half a percent, and Meyer fell slightly. The three small hot stocks rose by half a percent. The relatively unpopular small and medium-sized stocks rose slightly and stably. The world book was erratic due to the erratic supply and demand. Yesterday, it suddenly fell a lot. The veteran stocks were stable and unchanged.

Foreign stocks were still difficult to develop. The supply and demand of each stock was different, and the rise and fall were small. Yi Yarn opened at 8,900 yuan, and fell slightly to 8,600 yuan. The rest of the stock market was slightly volatile and fluctuated only. As a result, compared with the previous closing, Yinglian, Yiguang, and Pingping were calculated. Yi Yarn, Yi Beer, Huideying, and Asian Steel Industry all fell slightly. The paper industry was slightly outside, and the market did not change much.

### Foreign Banks Still Need to Ask for Instructions - Silver and Money Preparation Association Not Established - More Than 160 Participants

[Our Newspaper] It was previously reported that the Silver and Money Industry Joint Preparation Association would be formally established today. Now, the reporter visited the association's preparatory office, and learned that the preparatory office had sent out circulars to 175 exchange firms and trust companies listed in the Shanghai Clearing House roster, inviting them to join. Yesterday was the deadline. Except for a few foreign banks, which had not yet participated because they still needed to ask for instructions from their home office, more than 160 had participated. It is expected that the inaugural meeting will be convened within a few days to decide on the future development of the association's business, so the news that it will be established today is inaccurate.

### Intend to Issue Treasury Bills - As Circulating Chips

It is also reported that after the establishment of the association, it will issue treasury bills as a circulating tool for members. Each member can use securities, government bonds, real estate, and warehouse receipts for goods, etc., to pay as a reserve at a 70% discount on the assessed amount, and the association will issue treasury bills. Each member can borrow from other firms with a full discount on the treasury bills received. The person in charge of the association also said that the establishment of the association will have a great effect on stabilizing Shanghai's finances. If any member encounters a sharp turnaround, no unexpected situation will occur.

### Oil Price Returns to Flat - Oil Factories Continue to Supply - Allocated Price Still as Before

The market price of edible oil in this city has been rising recently. The municipal government is trying to suppress it. Yesterday, trading was restored. The China Vegetable Oil Factory has been allocating 200 barrels per day since the 24th of this month, and it is still continuing to allocate them. It is reported that the daily consumption of edible oil is about 1,500 dan. The 200 barrels allocated by the China Vegetable Oil Factory are about 700 dan, which already accounts for half of the suspension. Although the sources of edible oil in northern Jiangsu and Qingdao are scarce, the inventory is very abundant, so there is not much shortage. The recent surge in market prices was actually manipulated by someone. After being released, it was cancelled and collected in the market, resulting in an imbalance between supply and demand, and the market price was raised. After a thorough investigation by the Social Affairs Bureau's staff, they consulted with the China Vegetable Oil Factory to do their best to maintain the supply as usual. The 200 barrels allocated daily are still at the price of last Friday (26th), which is 68,000 yuan per dan.

### Yarn and Cotton Cloth Still Have No Improvement

Yesterday, the yarn market was as sluggish as before. Large-scale yarns such as Ji Ma's price did not fall again, but small and medium-sized yarns still could not stand firm, resulting in another drop of about 20,000. People's hearts were still weak, and there was still no improvement in transactions. At noon, the Spinning and Construction Department opened yarn as usual, but the number of purchasers was far less than before.

Yesterday, New York's American cotton telegrams all fell by 30 to 44 pounds. It is estimated that the recent American gold is 31.74, the new cotton futures is 28.83, and the Midlin spot is 32.48. The local transactions were normal. Only Hongjun and Datong two yarn factories purchased slightly. The market price was slightly flat due to the frequent fall of American cotton.

The cloth market had very few transactions, and people's hearts were scattered. Because the foreign market was depressed, the guest houses did not handle it, and the market prices of each store fell by 250 yuan to 500 yuan.

### Datong Commercial Bank - Shareholders Meeting Held Yesterday - Expanding Capital and Re-electing Supervisors

Datong Commercial Bank in this city was established in 1930. The head office was originally located in Chongming, and a branch was set up in Shanghai. In 1939, it was approved by the Ministry of Economy to set up the head office in Shanghai Beijing Road No. 280. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00, the shareholders' meeting was held in the bank to adjust the capital to 30 million national currency, amend the articles of association, and elect Lu Caifu, Yu Jinting, Luo Qinghua, Sun Ruihuang, Ma Shaomu, Zhong Xiasheng, Shi Danfu, Shen Jinfu, and Ma Juying as nine directors, and Song Cunxin, Wang Yuqiao, and Pan Lianfa as three supervisors.

### Food Sources Keep Arriving - Grain Review Committee Further Reduces Negotiated Price - Flour and Miscellaneous Grains Generally Weak

The Social Affairs Bureau's Food Review Committee held its twelfth flat-price review meeting yesterday. Attended by Ji Chaozhai, head of the Food Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Yin Fuxiang, Cai Shengming, Zhang Xihu, Qu Zhenhua, Yang Jiuzi, and Qian Xingzhong of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Because the sources of rice are constantly arriving. Therefore, the review price was determined to be 62,000 yuan for white japonica, which is 2,000 less than before, 67,500 yuan for door sales, 60,000 yuan for sheep indica, which is 3,000 less, 65,500 yuan for door sales, 53,000 yuan for port indica, which is 3,000 less, 58,000 yuan for door sales, 48,000 yuan for Qu indica, which is 3,000 less, 52,500 yuan for door sales, and 43,000 yuan for white indica. It is 3,000 yuan less, and the door sales are 47,000 yuan, all of which have fallen compared to before. In a blink of an eye, the Mid-Autumn Festival is approaching, and there is a possibility of further decline. 70,000 bags of Yue rice (every 100 bags equals 150 shi) can arrive in Shanghai today and be sold to the allocated rice shops. The investigation of qualified people has increased by 200 yesterday. The total is 1,100. The amount of brown rice previously allocated was more than 15,000. As of today, only about one-third has been sold by the rice shop owners. For the welfare of the colleagues of the company's factories, the Social Affairs Bureau can apply to the Food Section of the Social Affairs Bureau for allocation by the number of people in each company factory. Yesterday, a total of more than 8,000 shi arrived in the north and south markets, and the market sales were still sluggish. White japonica continued to fall by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, indica rice fell by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, white yuan was still less magical, and it also fell by about 1,000 yuan. Pudong new japonica continued to see 20 to 30 shi. Rice products are still early in color, and it also fell by more than 1,000 yuan. Flour has increased dramatically, with whole family and warship flour arrivals, and it has suddenly softened, stopping the rise and turning to fall, falling by 400 to 500 yuan. The guest gang of wheat Yong Min two gangs entered the stomach poorly, the market situation was flat, the medium and secondary rebounded and became weak, showing a slight reduction, and the skin also fell by 100 to 200 yuan. The arrival of soybeans was indifferent, and the removal and transformation were active and prosperous, forming two enemies. The digestion in the foreign ports was extremely small, and the oil factory's acceptance was not greedy. The retail in this street was slightly taken, and the opening remained in the bureau. There were slightly fewer broad beans and finished goods. After the sharp drop in the middle and lower grades, there were inquiries, and it turned from tired to hard, and the high goods still tended to be flat.

### Amidst the Clouds and Mist of Lushan

— Special Correspondent Xie Baozhu, dispatched by this newspaper from Kuling Airmail

One reason the Chairman likes Lushan is because "the mountains have water." It is said he once remarked: "Emei Mountain is beautiful but lacks water, causing people to avoid seeking summer refuge there. Lushan is superior because it has both mountains and water." The Chairman loves water, especially the "quiet sound of flowing water" to aid his thoughts.

The sedan chairs of the Chairman and his wife are slightly different from the others. The sedan roof is made of black lacquer cloth, the sides are blue cloth, and the sedan poles are one-third longer than usual, painted black. The wood is strong, fine, and durable, originating from the Xikou area of Zhejiang. Each tree can only yield one suitable pole. It is said that sitting on them is as smooth as riding in a car, and even the sedan bearers changing shoulders is hardly noticeable. This is mostly due to the skilled sedan bearers, who have had over ten years of experience carrying the Chairman's sedan, from Lushan to Chongqing and back again. There are a total of twelve sedan bearers regularly, six for each shift, all wearing blue cloth short shirts and trousers, and white grass hats.

Two sedan chairs specially made for Marshal Ma and his wife are currently being processed in Jiujiang and will be completed and ready for use soon. It is said that each chair costs 470,000 yuan, and they are not even the best quality.

Kuling's cafes, despite having three establishments: "Carlton," "Yuan Ming Yuan," and "Green Quality," are lacking. The coffee at the first is like "burnt rice water," the second is like "brown sugar water," and the third is like "scorched rice soup." But with each cup costing only 400 yuan, one cannot be too critical.

Fruits are both expensive and scarce. Fruits posing as "raw open-shi" cost 900 yuan each, small green apples cost 2,400 yuan per catty. Watermelons are more plentiful and cheaper, but large and not sweet. Overripe loquats are ignored, causing Old Guan to frown.

There's only one proper shop. One has a wireless radio, and three have phonographs, with almost all records being Peking Opera. The "newest" song is "Miss Zhilan."

Chewing gum is sold in three places, but few people pay attention to it, so the price "can't go up" (liclets) at 300 yuan per box (containing two pieces).

Among cigarettes, "Philip Morris" is popular, with the morning wind and also resembling early summer, while the evening resembles early autumn.

No fewer than twenty reporters from various places have added a lot of vitality to Lushan, but the telegraph office is overwhelmed. Evening newspapers call in the morning, and daily newspapers call in the evening, and only after 1 or 2 AM does it quiet down slightly. In addition, phone calls to and from various agencies are also incessant.

There are only forty-eight foreigners on the mountain. The "extravagance" is incomparable to previous years. One foreigner wanted to buy a five-pound can of "Golden Gate" milk powder, priced at 26,000 yuan, but after bargaining down to 20,000 yuan, the deal fell through.

They then came to an agreement five minutes later for the same price, because he realized 26,000 was the lowest price in town.

There are three decent photo studios, "Yangtze," "Honghua," and "Luzhen," but business is not booming. They only sell existing stock of scenic photos, but are quite busy developing and printing for customers, the results of the newly arrived reporters' "nerve war." Although the prices are high, 1,000 yuan for developing and 400 yuan for a four-inch print, it is impossible not to have them developed.

The mountain weather is like three seasons in one day: the morning is like early spring, the middle

Cheap, at 9,500 yuan per carton.

Streetlights are like phosphorescent fire, with several places in the dark. Pedestrians must carry walking sticks and flashlights at night.

The residents on the mountain have this habit: their manners are slow, their movements are sluggish, and whenever asked a question, they go around in circles, unable to resolve it for half a day. It is unknown whether this is due to the influence of the clouds and mist.

The trend of entertaining reporters has gradually increased. The first time was an invitation by the Administration Bureau on the afternoon of July 21st, with refreshments served to guests, and hosts and guests were all happy.

Most reporters stay at the Hu Jinfang Hotel and have set up their own club, due to everyone being overly tense all day, with official business outweighing entertainment.

The "Summer Voice" drama troupe, responding to an invitation from the Summer Camp, has over seventy members. On the 26th, they arrived in Lushan from Hankou, each child carrying a can of relief organization's milk powder on their waist, walking up the mountain. The total cost for this trip is ten million yuan, reportedly with the Jiangxi Province Chairman Wang Lingji bearing five million and the Summer Camp providing five million. However, the treatment of the troupe members is lacking, with children sleeping on the floor and meals consisting of only one dish.

The Livelihood Society has taken over thirty-two houses here, so all foreign guests who come to the mountain are handled and entertained by the Society.

The Livelihood Society provides movies for some to watch. The Summer Camp shows them about twice, Marshal Ma's residence shows them two or three times, and the church also has two showings a week. This is the only movie entertainment on the mountain, but unfortunately the equipment is not very good and the electricity is insufficient, so watching for one hour requires waiting for one hour, which is very tiring.

Latest news: Marshal Ma's wife greatly admires Chinese-style qipaos and would like to have a few made to wear. Therefore, Madame Chiang has specifically ordered her own tailor to go and make them for Marshal Ma's wife.

### Chairman's Official Residence in Lushan

— Special Correspondent Xie Baozhu, dispatched by this newspaper from Kuling Airmail

Not far after walking through Kuling Street, you can see a colorful oil painting of the Chairman, over ten feet high and eight feet wide, standing in front of a green grove. The mercury lamp in front of the portrait, because the position was not suitable, has already been changed from an oblique angle to vertical, and is being modified for the third time on the opposite telephone pole. Unfortunately, the power of the Magic Mountain is insufficient, and the light emitted from the four light bulbs still has a yellow hue. To the left of the Chairman's portrait is Hedong Road, where the official residence is located. If you walk forward and approach Mansion No. 12, you can find another oil painting of Madame Chiang, which is smaller than the Chairman's portrait. In front of the official residence, there is a small bridge with green railings and a blue bridge deck leading to the opposite Hexi Road, which is Marshal Marshall's residence. Similarly, on Hexi Road, there is also an image of Marshal Ma, all of which are painted with a vivid spirit, making people feel solemn and respectful. A clear stream separates the east and west roads, with the gurgling water bringing a constant rhythm of sound to the silence.

The design of the Chairman's official residence is very special, resembling a row of low stone bridges in a wave pattern. However, because they are too low, they are now preparing to plant cypress trees around them. To the right of the entrance is the garden. Before the War of Resistance, when Madame Chiang came to Lushan for summer, she often played golf in this garden, accompanied by Mr. Donner. It is said that the garden was almost completely destroyed by the Japanese during the occupation. Not only were there no flowers left, but even the turf was scraped off. Madame Chiang loves flowers and trees, so after coming to the mountain this time, she has been personally supervising the gardeners to rearrange the garden every day, and has also studied the planting of flowers and plants with Marshal Marshall. To the left of the gate, passing through a climbing frame and up the stone steps, you can reach the veranda on the first floor of the residence, which faces the garden. On the veranda are milky-white chairs and a rattan table, with potted flowers around the semi-circle. Sometimes, when the weather is sunny and slightly hot, the Chairman and his wife entertain guests on the veranda.

Downstairs, there is a large living room, dining room, lounge, and office, each with very simple and tidy interior arrangements. The furniture is milky-white, the vermilion window frames are fitted with screens, and the curtains are made of light yellow fabric. The sofa covers are all in horizontal stripes of light green and milky-white, with embroidered cushions. There is a small story behind the "Fu Lu Shou" (Fortune, Prosperity, Longevity) trio displayed on the mantelpiece in the living room. When the Japanese forcibly occupied Lushan, they moved the trio from the official residence. Because a Japanese officer was living in the house of the American Consul General Smythe in Tianjin at the time, the trio were moved there. This time, when Madame Chiang came, she discovered that the trio were missing and was very upset, but there was nothing she could do. Coincidentally, Mrs. Smythe invited Madame Chiang to her house to play. As soon as Madame Chiang entered the living room, she realized that the trio were antiques from her mansion. Mrs. Smythe only realized this at this time, so she immediately handed them over to the attendants to send back to the Chairman's residence.

Upstairs on the second floor, there is also a veranda similar to the one downstairs, with similar furnishings, but with an additional sleeping chair. The Chairman and his wife pray, do gymnastics, and read books here in the morning. Above the large living room is the bedroom, behind it is the Chairman's study, and next door is Madame Chiang's study, as well as a small living room, a bathroom, and several other rooms. The upstairs reception room is mostly used by Madame Chiang to meet female guests. The furniture and curtains are in the same colors as downstairs. Madame Chiang does not like walls and furniture painted with stimulating colors; she prefers light yellow and milky-white paint. In addition to the large veranda, there is also a small veranda behind the small living room, but the two verandas are not connected.

The Chairman's official residence used to have its own generator, but it was taken away by the enemy! The electricity now used is generated by the public power plant, and it goes off at midnight.

The architecture of this mansion can truly be said to be very old. However, the Chairman and his wife both prefer to live in their original old home. Although it is somewhat dilapidated, it brings them a sense of familiarity and profound feeling.

Bird's-Eye View of Shasta Dam

Shasta Dam is located on the Sacramento River in northwestern California and is the fourth largest dam in the world. It is four hundred and eighty feet high and stores more than 1,100,000 acre-feet of water. The 29-mile-long lake is a center for recreation, with hotels and other facilities. The dam was built at an accelerated pace in three years, and its first power plant began generating electricity in January 1945. Fontana Dam is an important part of the TVA's plan for flood control, irrigation, and power generation. (Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing)

### TVA: A Paradise in the Mountains and Valleys of Tennessee

— Airmail Report from the 16th, Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing stationed in the United States

Tennessee is an elongated parallelogram, surrounded by mountains on all sides. My image of Tennessee is like Sichuan in China, and some places are very similar to Guizhou and Yunnan. The southeastern corner of the United States is an agricultural mountain country, just as the southwestern mountains of China are still rich in agriculture. Americans have two nicknames for Tennesseans: one is called "Volunteer," which is said to be a story from the Civil War era. President Lincoln recruited brave warriors from the South to volunteer for service. Tennesseans, born in the mountains, were known for their bravery, so they volunteered as "Volunteers." Although this is a nickname, it is also a fact. Now that the United States is recruiting volunteers nationwide, many young people from Tennessee are actively joining the military.

Tennessee's Length and Breadth

Another nickname for Tennesseans is "Hill Billy," which means "ruralized." In Shanghai dialect, it is called "xiangqu." Tennessee is mostly mountainous, and many Tennesseans living in the mountains and valleys cultivate their own land and have little contact with the outside world. Therefore, when they go to New York or Chicago, they see novelty everywhere and are inevitably flustered. This, of course, describes only a part of the population. In fact, there are many people of this type in Tennessee. Zhang Renjia, a student at the University of Tennessee, told me that many Tennesseans living in deep mountain valleys have been almost isolated from the world for decades. When they see the latest material civilization of the United States, they may be even more surprised than we are.

For example, people in New York and Chicago seem to be accustomed to taking pictures, but in the rural areas of Tennessee, it is still considered a "big deal." When a farm child in Tennessee is taken to have a photo taken, he may jump up with joy, or he may solemnly go home to change his clothes and come back. Social interaction between men and women in the countryside of Tennessee is very conservative. They are polite and fully retain the "gentleman" tradition of English immigrants.

These different habits are largely due to growing up in the mountains. Before the TVA came to Tennessee, Tennessee was one of the poorest states in the forty-eight states of the United States. Although the southwestern states of New Mexico and Arizona are mostly deserts, they have had irrigation systems for a long time. The soil of Tennessee is red soil, and there are also many bare stone mountains like those in Sichuan and Guizhou. Every year in the early summer rainy season, the "mountain floods" in the eastern mountains rush down like wolves and tigers, and many fields, houses, livestock, and even entire market towns in Tennessee are submerged in the flood. The floodwaters flow from the Tennessee River into the Ohio River, and then into the Mississippi River, flowing into the Atlantic Ocean. After the water recedes, the land in Tennessee returns to drought. Thus, back and forth, the agriculture of Tennessee is: "Nine years of drought in ten years." The honest and simple farmers of Tennessee live in sorrow and gloom all year round.

Great Construction

However, a great construction has changed their entire world. This is the TVA. I cannot help but praise the greatness of the TVA, especially from the perspective of someone coming from the ruined rural areas of China. When I returned to Knoxville after visiting the dam project, my friend Schaffer from the news department asked me about my impressions. I told him, "I am not a power expert, nor an agricultural expert; therefore, I do not understand many of the technical issues inside. But I understand one thing, and that is that China needs it!"

There are ten thousand things to say, and I don't know where to start. Well, let me first introduce a farmer from Tennessee, Samuel.

I met Samuel on the fifth day of my visit to Tennessee. That day, Judge Percy of the Supreme Court of Belgium and I visited the Fort Loudoun Dam. Because we wanted to understand the agriculture of Tennessee, the管理局 (Administration Bureau) specifically sent an agricultural expert, Mr. Blanc, to accompany us. After returning from the dam, we circled around in the nearby fields and finally found Samuel's house.

Samuel's three generations of family live on a farm. His father, Old Samuel, is over seventy years old, and his speech is already slurred. His children are all young and cannot help with farming. Therefore, the responsibility of production for the whole family rests on him alone. He farms one hundred acres of land (equivalent to 600 acres in China) by himself. Sometimes, he feels slightly overwhelmed, but he has machines, so harvesting and planting are not a problem. He led us to see his fields on the hillside and at the foot of the mountain, with sorghum, tobacco, wheat, tomatoes, and soybeans. He said that nine years ago, this was all uncultivable wasteland, and everything was washed away by floods. However, since the TVA dam was built, he has had "fertilizer" (provided by the TVA) that doesn't cost money, and he has several harvests every year. Last month, he harvested four acres of wheat, yielding a total of 104 bushels.

He only has to pay the government forty-two yuan in taxes for one hundred acres of land each year. He raises twenty-nine head of cattle and sometimes uses animal power to help with farming, because he only has two machines. He said that he still lacks a machine for harvesting sorghum, so manpower is very wasteful. Teachers and students from the Agricultural College of the University of Tennessee come every season to help him improve seeds and remove "pests and diseases" from crops, and also guide him on how to rotate crops such as tobacco and sorghum in the same land.

The entire TVA does not have special irrigation projects. I asked him: If it doesn't rain for a long time, how do you divert water up the hillside? He scratched his head and could not answer. He said: It won't happen, it will definitely rain! He also said: As long as there are no floods, this will definitely be a year of abundance. The TVA has already done this for them.

Samuel is a thirty-five-year-old middle-aged farmer, wearing a pair of broken leather shoes on his muddy legs. His face and arms are covered with hair, and his skin is tanned red and purple by the sun. He speaks with a touch of simplicity and charm. He is a typical Tennessee "country elder."

The Story of History

Why is the TVA able to win the support of farmers? Here, we must start with a bit of historical story:

During the First World War, German submarines once reached the Chilean (South American) coast, and the US government was shocked, and then made rapid progress in the defense industry. However, as a result of the advancement, the motivation was not enough. Some people knew that the Tennessee water power could be used to generate electricity to increase power, so they suggested that President Wilson build a dam. The dam was not completed, and the war ended, so the case was shelved. In 1933, President Roosevelt took office. Due to the proposal of Senator Norris, the Tennessee Water Conservancy Project was rebuilt, which gave birth to the so-called TVA.

The full name of TVA is Tennessee Valley Authority, which is a state-owned enterprise directly under the President. (I will introduce these points in another article.) It was established in 1933. At that time, there were three tasks, which were officially passed by Congress and handed over to the Administration Bureau: First, to prevent flooding in the Tennessee River Valley. Second, to dredge the waterways of the Tennessee River. Third, to use hydropower to increase industrial power.

The basic work of these three major tasks is to build dams. Without dams, it is impossible to prevent floods, navigate shipping, or have power. Therefore, people generally think of the TVA as just twenty-six dams, but in fact, the scope of TVA's business is far more than that.

The Tennessee River meanders across the entire state of Tennessee, from the eastern mountainous area to the Mississippi River, the east is high and the west is low, so before there were dams, there were rapids and shoals, like the Jinsha River above Yibin in Sichuan. The TVA's dam projects are distributed on the upper and lower reaches of the Tennessee River and its tributaries. There are many dams in the upper reaches, extending into North Carolina and Georgia. The highest and largest dam, "Fontana," is in North Carolina, and the dam is 480 feet high, parallel to the mountain peaks on both sides. The upper reaches of the Tennessee River thus meander through the valleys.

Norris Dam

This is the first completed TVA project, with a power generation capacity of 100,000 kilowatts. The dam stores more than 2,250,000 acre-feet of water, of which more than 500,000 acre-feet of water is controlled by fourteen-foot-high gates. The picture shows the amount of water being released from the gates. (Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing)

Fontana Dam

On the day I visited Fontana Dam, a young staff member, Maurice, accompanied me. We set off from Knoxville and had to drive for two hours on mountain roads. The car drove out of the Knoxville basin and entered the mountains. The roads were all narrow paths, leaning against the mountains and facing the valleys, with a bend every three steps and a turn every five steps, very much like the highway from Chongqing to Yuanling. Maurice compared it to the "Burma Road," and was very nervous while driving, fearing that he would collide with oncoming cars on the corners. Near Fontana Dam, there were steep mountains, and Fontana Dam was built parallel to the mountain peaks. From a distance, you could still see the large cement buildings.

The construction of Fontana Dam cost 73 million US dollars, ranking second in the cost of dam projects. The first place is the Kentucky Dam, costing 111.5 million US dollars. Fontana Dam is the highest of the twenty-six dams, with a difference of more than 400 feet between the water level in front of and behind the dam. The dam is entirely made of steel and concrete. Cars can pass over the dam. The water flows from the middle of the dam into the power plant, turning the shafts of the motors, and then flows out of the dam. In this way, Fontana Dam can generate 202,500 kilowatts of electricity. Near Fontana is a place called "Oak Ridge," which was the famous atomic bomb manufacturing plant during the war. The creation of the atomic bomb required a large amount of electricity, and the TVA was responsible for supplying the electricity.

Social Services

The names of donors will be published in both Shen and Xin newspapers to show great faith

The Father's Day Promotion Committee sent a letter to this newspaper yesterday regarding the collection of educational donations, saying: "To the General Manager Chen of the Shen Bao Newspaper: With the Father's Day on August 8th approaching, our committee plans to raise educational donations from August 1st to 8th. Please have your newspaper exclusively collect these donations to ensure uniformity. Correspondingly, we hereby inform you, hoping that you will approve this and notify your affiliates to handle this matter. Respectfully, The Father's Day Promotion Committee." It is heard that the committee will not adopt public meetings for this year's Father's Day, but will have each family in the country hold individual commemorations, and believes that the most meaningful commemoration is to donate to the "educational fund" to help out-of-school youth. The method is that the committee's founders and sponsors first lead by example, donating educational funds. Those who donate more than 50,000 yuan will be listed as a team. Those whose fathers are alive will be named "Father's Day Celebration, Wishing Father Health and Happiness Team," and those whose fathers have passed away will be named "Father's Day Commemoration, Continuing Father's Legacy Team." Donations of less than 50,000 yuan will not be listed as a team, but must be at least 1,000 yuan. The names of all donors will be published daily in both the Shen Bao and Xin Wen newspapers to show great faith.

The Father's Day commemoration is the first one to be held after the victory. The committee has notified major cities across the country in advance, and everyone will commemorate it together at that time, so its grandness can be known. Originally, everyone has a father, and everyone should commemorate Father's Day. If the commemoration is empty, it is only temporary in nature, and as time and circumstances change, what is the meaning of this? If we can work together and everyone donates a little to the "educational fund" to help orphaned out-of-school youth, it is a good deed that kills two birds with one stone. It is hoped that readers who respect their fathers will unite and "help education" to commemorate their fathers, and "help education" to commemorate their fathers!

### Soda Water: The Most Ideal Summer Beverage

— Xinghai

Although some consider cold drinks a luxury, broadly speaking, they can be considered a natural physiological need. The summer weather is always very hot, usually around 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Therefore, we can only dissipate excess heat from our bodies through sweating, which helps maintain a stable body temperature. The hotter the weather, the more we sweat, and the thirstier we become. This is a clear indication that the body needs to replenish water.

Soda water and ice cream are two main food items. However, it is quite a stretch to call ice cream a beverage. Ice cream is a delicious food that is suitable for both summer and winter. Its thirst-quenching effect is minimal. Ice cream contains very little water and is too sweet and rich; sometimes, it even makes you feel drier.

Only soda water is the ideal summer beverage.

Soda water has a low sugar content, and its concentration is roughly equivalent to the osmotic pressure of blood. It can replenish the water lost through sweating. The carbon dioxide in soda water also aids digestion and refreshes and cools the body.

Soda water can meet the needs of the masses, from high-ranking officials to ordinary laborers. Therefore, the soda water industry has developed rapidly in recent years. In addition to soda water factories with a considerable history, such as Zheng Guanghe, Watson's, Victory, Tianhua, Central, Zhonghua, and Yili, many small-scale soda water factories have also been established this year to compensate for the overdemand. However, some small soda water factories inevitably have crude equipment. This concerns public health, and we urge the health authorities to pay due attention to it.

### Picnic in the Summer Heat

— Yizi

Mount Lu is one of China's famous mountains, located about two to three kilometers southwest of Jiujiang, nestled between the Yangtze River and Poyang Lake. Guling is one of the peaks of Mount Lu, and the temperature in the surrounding area is no higher than 75 or 76 degrees Fahrenheit even during the hottest times, making it an excellent summer resort. On the 14th, Chairman Chiang and his wife flew to Jiujiang and then to Mount Lu. Mrs. Marshall followed the next day. On the 18th of this month, Special Envoy Marshall also accompanied the newly appointed U.S. Ambassador to China, Stuart, on a special plane to Mount Lu to see Chairman Chiang and present his credentials.

Facing the broad and tranquil Poyang Lake, on a peak of Mount Lu, about ten miles from Guling, someone, for some reason, gave this scenic spot a beautiful name, calling it "Hanpokou" (Mouth of Holding Poyang), because its imposing manner seems to swallow the entire Poyang Lake. Chairman Chiang and his wife, along with Special Envoy Marshall and his wife, held their first picnic together at Hanpokou from 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM yesterday, creating the most beautiful scene for Mount Lu. Chairman Chiang wore his usual military uniform, while his wife wore a Western-style mountain-climbing outfit. Marshal Marshall rarely wore civilian clothes in Nanjing, but since entering Guling, he has almost completely abandoned his military uniform. Of course, yesterday at Hanpokou, he also appeared with a graceful and agile demeanor. Mrs. Marshall has at least several sets of sky-blue Western-style outfits. As far as the reporter remembers, the style and color of her clothes never seem to change.

Four sedan chairs were used, two from Chairman Chiang's residence and the other two ordinary sedan chairs from the China Travel Service. Mrs. Marshall and Mrs. Chiang sat in the first two, more comfortable ones, walking ahead, while Marshal Marshall and Chairman Chiang sat in the latter two, walking behind. Meeting reporters on the way, Mrs. Chiang naturally and happily asked, "How did you kids know?" "We knew three days ago." "Ah, you're really 'clairaudient'!"

Chairman Chiang also said to the reporters with a smile, "Are you here to play?" Although these words are simple, those who have come from Nanjing, especially those who have lived as reporters in Chongqing, feel a sense of encouragement. Originally, the Chairman was so diligent and hardworking, managing so many affairs every day, that the opportunities to meet reporters were too few. Therefore, everyone believed that after the victory, there would be more contact with the head of state. Thus, something like the White House press conferences of the US President was also anticipated.

The fresh air on the mountain made the reporters feel that the Chinese "White House press conference" was no longer an ideal but a reality that would come soon. Yesterday at Hanpokou, the Chairman saw us, took photos, and then asked amiably, "Are you news reporters?" "Yes." As soon as we said that, the Chairman nodded and said, "Good."

In addition, during the conversation, the Chairman casually slipped in a foreign word, "Where are we having the 'picnic'?" Of course, the reporters felt it was something precious. The "picnic" itself we didn't get to see, but the summer camp press conference sent us on our way back.

### Random Thoughts on Fans

— Yun Sun

In summer, when you feel the air is sweltering, you instinctively pick up a fan to drive away the stuffy air around you and enjoy a moment of coolness. This is the only function of a fan.

However, fans change their function according to their owners, and their owners' identities can be seen from them.

A hardworking farmer, with a worn-out palm-leaf fan tucked into his waistband, uses it to fan away the foul sweat on his body when he is drenched in sweat, and uses it as a temporary straw hat to block the fierce sun when the sun is scorching; in the evening, when enjoying the cool air, it exerts another special skill, becoming the only tool to drive away mosquitoes, allowing its owner to truly enjoy a moment of happiness. Praising it as "the able do more."

A flamboyant actor, constantly waving a beautiful large paper fan on the stage regardless of the cold or heat, opening and closing it freely; its current function is the only ornament of its owner.

Leisured gentlemen, lying horizontally on a chaise lounge, gently waving a paper fan bringing a gentle breeze, enjoying the blessing of a gentle breeze, a leisurely scene, all expressed by this fan.

Comfortable young masters, intentionally or unintentionally waving an exquisite sandalwood fan, fully enjoying the bursts of sandalwood fragrance, or appreciating drawings by famous people, further expressing their identity as "young masters who wave fans while farmers' hearts are boiling like soup."

Modern young ladies, feeling that waving a fan when going out is a bit outdated, as it would hinder their modern appearance, rarely use fans. However, sometimes they carry a small, exquisite, beautiful colored fan in their purse, sprinkled with a large amount of French night-blooming jasmine. When she chats with you, she will intentionally or unintentionally unfold it, and a strong, fragrant aroma will immediately rush to your nose, making you feel drowsy and your heart flutter, as if you have entered a new-style soul-entrapment formation, deeply making you feel that she is a noble, modern young lady. Even if you see this fan in other places, it is not difficult to imagine what kind of person its owner is.

Students in schools use fans of various colors. In the classroom, boys use them as screens for passing notes, eating peanuts, and reading novels, while girls use them as cover for looking in the mirror, applying lipstick, and writing love letters, exerting another special function.

In addition, there are magicians' fans, dancers' peach-blossom fans for performing nude dances, and reclusive hermits' goose-feather fans that proclaim their extraordinary status, all with their own different uses.

However, here I want to talk about a "king of fans," which not only pales the aforementioned fans in comparison, but even if Princess Iron Fan's fire fan and the Mad Monk Ji Gong's divine fan were to reappear, they would have to yield to it. That is the broken palm-leaf fan discarded next to the stove. Do not underestimate it. Although it is silent, it can turn the sparks in the stove into raging flames, burning piles of bean stalks and boiling beans born from the same root, causing brothers to turn against each other, siblings to fight each other, and ultimately both sides are injured. Then it sits back and reaps the benefits, laughing triumphantly on the side. But it usually hides behind its master, waiting for an opportunity to act. As soon as there is a spark in your stove, it immediately shows its skills, turning a small fire into a big fire, and a big fire into an inextinguishable fire, cooking the entire pot of beans and burning your furniture and even your entire house. It is not restricted by the cold and heat of the four seasons, and can exert its power anytime and anywhere. And its master is a sinister and evil person who incites others from behind at all times, causing the incited to suffer great harm.

Now is summer, also the most popular season for fans. Various kinds of fans are displayed in the market, each with its own purpose. However, you must pay close attention to this kind of fan, because its master is a person, an organization, an institution, or a country. It hides behind these masters, making it impossible for you to defend against. Be vigilant and do not let its wind blow on you, otherwise it will definitely cause unimaginable consequences.

### Summer in Wuhan: Imagining the "Rooftop Mermaids"

— Nai Xin

From July 1st, it rained heavily for five consecutive days, and the water level of the Yangtze River rose step by step. As of the 7th, the water level had increased to 24.716 meters. According to a telegram from Chongqing, the river rose 18 meters in Chongqing in two days and 8 meters in Wanxian in two days. It seems that although the rain has stopped, Hankou will rise sharply again in three or four days. Some people say that this heavy rain was affected by the Bikini Atoll atomic bomb. In fact, this is doing voluntary publicity for the atomic bomb, which is very absurd, because before July 1st, the climate in Wuhan was hot and dry, which was a sign of heavy rain. Coincidentally, the atomic bomb was detonated on July 1st, and heavy rain also came. This is just a coincidence. According to Eastern meteorologists, the Yangtze River has a major flood every 20 years. The last one was in 1931, so it shouldn't be time for another one this year. However, nature often plays jokes on humans. You say it won't come? It insists on coming. This year the climate is abnormal, and the old embankments along the river have been neglected and dilapidated for many years during the occupation period. Therefore, a major flood like that of 1931 may come early this year.

Hankou has been tense for the past few days. The Jianghan Engineering Bureau is working around the clock during the emergency period. Various organizations and groups have organized a flood prevention committee, holding meetings every day, busy with their hands and feet in a mess. The dikes and sluices are ready to be sealed, the pumps are ready, and the sewer openings are about to be closed... But what about the funds? Everyone is shirking responsibility, and there is still not a penny. Mr. Zhou Cangbai, director of the Hubei branch of the Post-War Relief Administration, said at the meeting yesterday: "I hope everyone who has money will contribute money, and those who have strength will contribute strength, and mobilize all citizens to prevent floods. Our branch has no problem, but the money is foreign money, and we can't make decisions, so I hope everyone will contribute money first. We will definitely provide support when necessary. Because this concerns the lives and property of all Hankou citizens." Someone joked that the Relief Administration is the Post-War Relief Administration and only takes care of "post-war relief."

The tragic situation of the "rooftop mermaids" during the 1931 flood is still remembered by some. The streets were more than ten feet deep, and only the tops of the buildings were left in the city. People climbed out of the windows and took boats... Let's hope that Miss Yangtze River doesn't get angry!

### Reminiscences of Mount Lu

— Zhao Xi

The weather is sweltering. I sit alone in the small courtyard late at night, looking up at the white clouds rolling and stretching in the sky, watching the waning moon, feeling very leisurely. Although there is no breeze at this time, I feel very peaceful in my heart. Looking at the white clouds in the sky, I am reminded of Mount Lu, a summer resort.

The beauty of Mount Lu is truly beyond words. After eight years of not setting foot in that land, I still deeply miss her every summer. It's not just the towering peaks, secluded and strange ravines, majestic waterfalls, and many ancient sites and scenic spots dotted among them. What I yearn for most is the clouds. Many poets throughout history have praised them, but unfortunately, I am not...

The clouds of Mount Lu are bizarre and ever-changing. People living in the mountains feel like they are in a mirage, elusive and unfathomable. In summer, many people seeking refuge from the heat gather in the Guling area. Before the war, Guling was extremely rich and bustling. There were many foreigners here. Guling Street had a completely foreign atmosphere. Countless villas of all types and classes of wealthy people surrounded Guling, inlaid among the green mountains and forests, just like dots of flowers on green trees. At night, the electric lights were brightly lit, like stars.

In 1937, when the all-out war of resistance broke out, Mount Lu was the decision-making center. I still remember that after the July 7th Incident at Lugou Bridge, Tianjin also started fighting. At that time, the situation was serious, and the whole country was shocked. The supreme commander was stationed in Mount Lu, carefully observing the situation and working hard, expressing, "We will never give up peace until peace is hopeless; we will never lightly talk about sacrifice until sacrifice has reached the final moment." For a time, generals gathered in Mount Lu, and the eyes of the world were focused here. Later, the commander made his decision and declared an all-out war of resistance. He then left the mountain, and the August 13th Battle of Shanghai followed, thus opening the curtain on the sacred war of resistance.

I heard that Mount Lu is now planned to be developed into a world park. High-ranking officials from the central government will be stationed in Mount Lu this month for office work, and the summer camp will also open on the 15th. The great cause of the famous mountain is truly admirable!

### On Translation Work

— Wei Yan

Recently, I have often seen many translated novels in bookstores that are difficult to understand. The skill of translating literary works should be to convey the spirit. This point depends on the translator's understanding of the social background. If the translator doesn't understand these, he won't be able to comprehend the spirit of the work, let alone convey it to others. There are also many translations of theoretical books that often leave readers in a fog, not only difficult to understand but also simply inexplicable. Here, we believe that the skill of translating theoretical works lies not in conveying the spirit but in conveying the truth. This point is actually not as difficult as conveying the spirit, but unfortunately, people who translate theoretical works often do not fully understand the works they are translating. How can their translations enable others to understand?

If we briefly analyze why this phenomenon occurs in the Chinese translation world, it is not difficult to find the reason. Originally, people engaged in translation work in China can be roughly divided into two types. One type is the "translation craftsman." They are quite proficient in a certain foreign language, so they translate any work written in that language, whether it is a novel, economics, or philosophy. They rely on translation as their main source of income. The other type is beginners. They specialize in studying a certain field. For their own convenience or out of eagerness to introduce works, they rashly undertake to translate a famous work without asking themselves: Are they able to use translation tools? Are they proficient in the content they are translating? They rely on translation as an introduction to research.

We believe that this phenomenon should be avoided. We need Chinese experts to undertake part of the translation work. We know that the Chinese academic community needs creativity, and we also believe that Chinese academic creativity needs the cultivation and nourishment of foreign culture. Otherwise, eclectic creation will be fragile and impoverished. Therefore, the importance of translation work is no less than that of creation. We hope that experts who are proficient in foreign languages and have specialized research in a certain field will introduce more masterpieces in that field to China.

At the same time, we hope that the Chinese publishing community will welcome this type of translation more and not be too profit-oriented, but do some cultural work for the country.

### Review of "American Foreign Policy"

— Sun Hang

By Walter Lippmann, translated by Luo Yinpu

Published by Chongqing Da Shi Dai Bookstore

Those who study American foreign policy say that it is like a pendulum. The pendulum swings left and then right, representing America's shifts between isolationism and cooperation with the world.

To this day, many people regret this policy. Some even say that after World War I, the American pendulum swung back to isolationism, betraying President Wilson's benevolent intentions and rejecting the proposal to join the League of Nations, which was one of the causes of World War II. If at that time, America had cooperated with the world, joined the League of Nations, and advocated a little justice, then totalitarian countries would not have dared to take risks, and the world could have saved many lives and much property.

However, there is also a good side to this swing of the American pendulum, which is that after experiencing the vicissitudes of the war and deeply suffering from this policy, the pendulum will no longer swing back. Many progressive elements in the United States have long understood the need for international peace and the impossibility of America staying out of it, and the general public is gradually showing aversion to isolationism and leaning towards world cooperation. Because if Americans continue to remain aloof, atomic bombs will soon be flying to Washington.

Therefore, American foreign policy must be re-examined and embark on a revolutionary stage. Its task is to maintain America's established position and honor as a world leader while also seeking to foster genuine cooperation and peace among nations.

Politician and Political Commentator

Mr. Walter Lippmann's recent book "American Foreign Policy" offers insightful commentary and practical contributions to this end. Lippmann is a politician and a renowned political commentator both at home and abroad. It is said that he was one of the behind-the-scenes writers of Wilson's famous Fourteen Points after World War I.

"American Foreign Policy" is a slim book, but its content is substantial and every word is meaningful. It addresses current issues and offers many constructive ideas, so it sells well in America and has become almost a household staple. Chongqing Da Shi Dai Bookstore has published a translation by Luo Yinpu, with a very fluent translation. It is also available for sale in various police stations in Shanghai.

The book is divided into two parts. The first part reviews the past, explaining the vacillation and contradictions of American foreign policy over the past half-century. The second part is the author's opinion on future policy, in which he strongly advocates that Americans should cooperate with the world and should no longer adhere to isolationism.

The Central Idea of the Entire Book

The central idea that runs through the entire book is: "How can America assume its foreign commitments?" In 1823, President Monroe announced that the Americas were for Americans, and America began to have foreign commitments. In order to prevent the encroachment of the great powers on South America, America must possess a strength sufficient to shoulder this responsibility. Later, America extended its influence in the Pacific Ocean. After Spain ceded the Philippines in 1899, its responsibility extended to places six or seven thousand nautical miles from its homeland.

However, American policymakers only took on the responsibility without strengthening their strength to balance it. Americans advocated disarmament in world conferences, and tolerated the Japanese building defensive works in the center of the Pacific that were hostile to Americans. They even opposed concerned friends, especially Britain, believing it to be a victory. These things directly or indirectly reduced America's strength and assistance, and almost led to the danger of America collapsing in this war.

Strength is Military and Allies

Therefore, Lippmann believes that if Americans are to assume foreign responsibilities, they must first have the strength commensurate with those responsibilities. This strength lies on one hand in extensive military preparations, and on the other hand in many friends. Lippmann said: "It is dangerous for one person to fight against many, but it is safe to stand on the side of many to fight against one person." He believes that Germany's initial victory in this war was because it was able to conclude an agreement with the Soviet Union and carefully cultivate American isolationism. Surrounding Japan were the Soviet Union, China, Britain, the Netherlands, and the United States, but none of these countries were its friends, and its only ally was the distant Germany, which could not provide timely help. Therefore, it was destined to fail.

America must find many allies in order to shoulder those foreign responsibilities, and this is precisely the mission of diplomacy.

Four-Power Core Alliance

Therefore, Lippmann finally strongly advocates that the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and China (if China is strong) should form a core alliance as the cornerstone of world peace. Lippmann strongly emphasizes the inevitability and necessity of the United States and Britain uniting, and his argument is very similar to that of Churchill.

However, this book is specifically written for Americans, so its arguments are all from an American perspective. When we Chinese read it, there are some places where we inevitably feel a bit alienated, and when it comes to expanding military preparations and shouldering responsibilities, we feel particularly alarmed.

A Few Opinions from the Chinese

We greatly admire Mr. Lippmann's advice to Americans to abandon their isolationist policy, but as a Chinese person or as a peace-loving cosmopolitan, there are a few points regarding Lippmann's foreign policy that must be discussed:

First, America's foreign responsibilities extend six or seven thousand nautical miles from its homeland, and Lippmann even says that China's territorial integrity and sovereign independence are almost one of those responsibilities. America being able to shoulder this huge responsibility is certainly a boon and a blessing to the world. However, if America's power is insufficient but it insists on shouldering this responsibility, it will only cause chaos and endless strife in the world. Therefore, in addition to finding ways to assume this responsibility, American foreign policy must also find ways to reduce this responsibility to match its strength. Lippmann's failure to see this is regrettable.

Second, "foreign responsibility" is a delicate term. When Lippmann says that China is one of America's foreign responsibilities, we do not know whether Lippmann is treating China as the Philippines was three years ago, or as a distressed friend in need of help. To put it more bluntly, will America's gradual expansion of power in the Pacific extend to the Asian continent and even Central Asia? We are deeply grateful for America's promises and goodwill assistance to China, and we will never forget it. But when its responsibilities gradually expand and meet the responsibilities of other countries, we become worried about world peace.

### Reading Quotes

— Wu Caolu

"Now, instead of pursuing practical learning through personal experience, people engage in textual criticism, discussing how someone describes human nature. This is not the way of a good scholar. Confucius and Mencius did not teach people this way. For example, if you want to go to Beijing, observe the stages of the journey, and then hire a boat, buy a horse, and set off immediately. Within two months, you can arrive in Beijing and see what the palaces, streets, wind, sand, and customs are like, all of which you will understand for yourself, without having to ask others. Now, instead of seeking to reach Beijing, people just meticulously study the records of those who have been there, comparing them and finding discrepancies in their accounts, which only adds to the confusion. Because they do not personally go to the place, but rely solely on the words of others, the more they seek, the further they get from the truth." (Essence of Rough Words)

### How the Steel Was Tempered

— Zheng Jia'ai

"The most precious thing a person has is life, and life is only given to us once. A person's life should be lived in such a way that when they look back on the past, they do not regret wasting their years, nor are they ashamed of their past incompetence. Then, when they are about to die, they can say: 'My entire life and energy have been dedicated to the most magnificent cause in the world—the struggle for the freedom and liberation of mankind.'" These are the words spoken by Nikolai Ostrovsky, through the voice of the protagonist Paul, in his great work "How the Steel Was Tempered."

Ostrovsky was a Soviet genius writer. He wrote two novels: "How the Steel Was Tempered" and "Born of the Storm." These two titles and themes are symbolic of his entire life—he grew up in hardship, and he stood up strongly, as resilient as steel. He suffered wounds during the revolution, becoming blind and disabled. Therefore, his works were all dictated and recorded by others.

"How the Steel Was Tempered" is Ostrovsky's first work, published in 1932. It immediately caused a sensation in the entire Soviet literary world. In seven years, it was reprinted one hundred times, selling approximately 3.5 million copies, and was translated into various languages and made into a film (which was recently shown in Shanghai). In 1935, the author received the honorary "Lenin" Medal from the Soviet government for this novel.

The book is set in the Soviet Union during the civil war from 1917 to 1922, and tells the story of the glorious struggle of a young Bolshevik. When the story begins, Paul Korchagin is only twelve years old. Because he is not welcome at school, he drops out and works in the kitchen of a railway station, where he lives for two years. There, he begins to learn about many unreasonable and ugly things in the world. Soon the revolution begins, and Paul becomes very interested in this turbulent era. He secretly does some things that he thinks are brave. Once, he is imprisoned for rescuing a sailor. As a result, he uses his wit to escape from death. From then on, he decides to participate in the heroic civil war. During this period, he suffers many serious injuries, but he never gives up, persisting to the end, until the post-war reconstruction and political work. The story also has lighthearted moments, such as Paul's love affair with Tonya. Tonya is the daughter of the forestry director, and her thinking is not thorough enough. In particular, her leisurely individualism wearies Paul. Their friendship gradually fades.

Paul in the book is really the author's own embodiment, and the content is entirely based on real experiences, so it is written vividly and realistically. His style is direct and strong. However, through artistic rendering, many scenes appear very beautiful and delicate, especially during the period when Paul and Tonya meet. The author uses delicate brushstrokes in psychological analysis, which is very fascinating. At the same time, the excellence of the technique and the compactness of the layout are simply unbelievable. This was dictated and recorded by someone else for him. In addition to its literary contributions, Ostrovsky's work has a more powerful inspiration for young people: life is by no means fragile; in the crucible of a great era, if you have a strong will, boundless strength, and enthusiasm, you can be as tough as steel, and you will not be like dust, which will disappear in an instant.

This novel translated into Chinese is about 120,000 words long. We have seen two translations in bookstores: one is translated by Mei Yi, published by Xinzhi Bookstore; and the other is a joint translation by Duan Luofu and Chen Feihuang, published by Chaofeng Publishing House. Relatively speaking, Mei Yi's style is more fluent and moving to read.

Regarding Ostrovsky's life, here is a brief introduction: He was born on September 29, 1904, in the village of Shepetovka in the Volyn province, located between Ukraine and Poland. This was a poor railway worker's family. His father died early, and his mother worked as a cook in a "wealthy family." His older brother was an ironworker in a railway repair factory. The family's livelihood depended entirely on meager wages. Ostrovsky entered elementary school at the age of six, and at the age of twelve, he went out to earn a living on his own. He herded horses, worked as a teaboy in a station restaurant, and worked as a laborer. Later, he worked as a stoker and power plant worker for a while. At the age of fifteen, he joined the civil war. In one battle, he was seriously injured. After recovering, he continued to dedicate himself to the revolution. In 1927, he developed hemiplegia, unable to move his limbs, and also went blind. This was the greatest suffering of his life. At this time, although Ostrovsky's body had died, his heart was still active. He resolved to convey his past experiences in literary language. So, in 1928, he began to create. His first masterpiece, "How the Steel Was Tempered," was published and achieved amazing success. At the end of 1936 (December 20), he passed away, but his second novel, "Born of the Storm," was not yet completed. However, after the book was published, it was also warmly welcomed by Soviet readers, with forty editions and 1.5 million copies printed in the two or three years after his death.

Ostrovsky used a determined spirit to complete his own writing. He once said, "No one can stop me from doing this. I feel healthy only when I am working." He was just like what he had said: "My entire life and energy have been dedicated to the most magnificent cause in the world—the struggle for the freedom and liberation of mankind."

### Preparation for Creation

— Author: Mao Dun, translated by Naya

Friends who love to write, especially those who are starting to write, need a book that indicates the correct writing methods to supplement their skills and cultivation. Here, I would like to introduce a more suitable book to you, which is Mr. Mao Dun's "Preparation for Creation."

A great writer is not only an artist, but also a thinker—in modern times, and at the same time, he must be a tireless warrior. His works not only reflect reality, but also consistently embody the life problems and ideological problems of his era, and he proposes answers.

Only in this way can he be considered a writer—an accomplished writer. You who are learning to write can diligently study hard until you succeed. Of course, it will take a lot of time. Research is not imitation. Research is learning the techniques, while imitation is simply and completely plagiarizing the appearance. So how should we learn? That should be from extensive reading to selective research.

For friends who are just starting to write, basic practice is necessary. Understand the theme and development of the characters in your work, and then collect materials. Then you must abide by the four words "select the best and use widely." You should squeeze and refine these materials.

When you write about a character, you must observe from many aspects, so that this "character" is not quite "someone we actually know," yet it is "very familiar." Among "our acquaintances" there are shadows of "him," a bit like "him," but not quite "him." Everyone is a bit like "him," but not "completely" like "him." You can meet "him" everywhere, but you cannot identify "him" as a specific person.

A character like this is successful, such as the familiar Ah Q.

With accurate characters, you also need a "broad environment" to allow him to live and express himself in this environment.

Having obtained accurate characters and environment, the prelude to writing is to compile an outline, which allows you to check whether your material is sufficient and whether there are still unclear areas.

Writing requires hard work. The so-called "careful creation" and "technical polishing" are all about this, and there is no clever trick.

If you have finished writing a work and you are not satisfied with it, and you are troubled by the fact that you don't know where the problem lies, then don't be discouraged or annoyed. You can work hard as usual, but put the work away. After some time, read it again, and you may see some problems that you were not previously aware of.

Finally, in writing, it firmly says that there are no "shortcuts" or "secrets."

I will not say more. I hope that friends who love to write can read this book and follow it, and one day they will naturally succeed.

Spring and Autumn

### A Remembrance of Friendship

— Xue Tianran

Shi Ming was indeed a lovable friend. I can't help but miss him; his passion and sincerity moved me profoundly.

Even though we are separated, his image lingers in my mind, making me realize how precious and warm friendship in this world can be.

I first met Shi Ming in the spring of the twenty-seventh year [of the Republic, i.e., 1938]; at that time, the waves of the War of Resistance were surging vigorously, and he and I were in the same guerrilla unit engaged in national salvation work. Looking back, I should feel quite apologetic because, due to my pride, I was so indifferent to comrades like Shi Ming, who didn't bear much responsibility. So much so that when we met again five years later, I couldn't even remember that he had been my colleague for a month. Hearing him vividly describe my active role back then, I felt deeply ashamed. Shi Ming! What reason did I have to neglect you and shut you out?

After our reunion, we became close from then on. He was as considerate as a girl is to her lover. In terms of living, he helped me so much. Most of the trivial matters were taken care of and resolved by him, freeing me from worrying about inconveniences everywhere in this new organization. In our frequent interactions, I suddenly discovered his writing talent one day. He didn't seem to have received a good school education, but the poems and essays before my eyes clearly seemed to come from the hand of a young writer, moving and graceful, with beautifully and elegantly crafted language. I was amazed and developed respect and goodwill towards him as if discovering a miracle.

The wartime environment was always turbulent and unstable. Before half a month had passed, I had to leave for business, and it so happened that he was assigned to work in another village. Therefore, I didn't even have time to inform him, and had to leave him a letter, separating from him with melancholy.

In the following two years, life underwent enormous changes. One of the fortunate things was that Shi Ming finally lived with me again. Shared suffering easily breeds sympathy. We lived together in poverty, spending our days in both pain and optimism. Gradually, I came to understand everything about Shi Ming, including the most minute details. He also gradually understood my character and personality. He was rich in emotions, treating people with a truly sincere heart. He was willing to endure hardship himself, leaving the better portion for me to enjoy. Especially in his concept of economy, there was absolutely no selfishness at all. It was not only "his is mine," but he wished he could use all he had and could have to exchange for my happiness and satisfaction. I received his help several times, all when I was at my wit's end. He sold his only clothes and sweaters, sacrificed his sister's gold ring, and ran around for a whole day, collecting money from all his friends to help me overcome successive disasters. As a sojourner in this completely unfamiliar small city, I was almost moved to tears by his loyalty and righteousness at the time. Even now, I cannot use any adjectives to adequately express my gratitude from the bottom of my heart.

Shi Ming was one year older than me. He came from a silk shop apprenticeship. When the storm of the great era descended upon China, he accepted the enlightenment of new ideas. Like many other educated young people, with a full sense of patriotic enthusiasm, he stepped onto the battlefield and threw himself into the torrent of the great national liberation. Shi Ming not only slowly absorbed knowledge of social science and philosophy, enriching his theoretical cultivation, but also absorbed invaluable experience and training, making him a daring fighter. He eventually jumped from the position of clerk and political work team member to the position of section chief and secretary. Just when he was looking forward to his future with joy and pride, the enemy's cruel mopping-up and lightning-like attack penetrated the guerrilla area, and a large number of workers withdrew, with Shi Ming being one of them.

Soon, Shi Ming began to appear in the occupied areas, and settled down. The time when he and I were inseparable was at that stage. We were both penniless, and we relied almost entirely on borrowing to get through each day. For a few days, we even sang "empty city stratagems" to overcome the threat of hunger with hope and singing. However, although the environment was extremely difficult, the shadow of pessimism still couldn't cover our hearts. A simple belief encouraged us: because tomorrow will eventually come, if we grit our teeth and endure today, why should we fear that victory does not belong to us? Especially Shi Ming's optimism, he seemed to regard any difficulty as unimportant. He confidently believed that anything that had been done, was being done, or was about to be done was "absolutely guaranteed" and "completely possible to succeed." He developed a habit of exaggerating when he spoke, and revealed an "self-satisfied" Ah Q-like habit everywhere. However, this did not detract from my impression of him, who was very familiar with him; the environment was too bad, and to persist in the struggle in the dark, one must have the greatest patience and perseverance. Shi Ming's personality directly increased my courage and resisted the weakness that came by chance.

Danger and hunger passed one by one and moved away. Life is indeed a kind of training. Even in a very uneasy mood, we still read several thick theoretical books. Mao Dun's "Corrosion" and many plays by Xia Yan and Chen Baichen were read while unable to sleep at night. They were like a new kindling that was stuffed into the hearts of me and Shi Ming, burning brightly with light and heat. There were also theatrical performances in this small city. Yao Ming watched "Grape Wine" (i.e., You Jing's "Night Light Cup"), and his emotions were so intense that he said to me with tears in his eyes: "I am not afraid of sacrifice. Revolution needs to be exchanged with the price of blood." I shook his hand and said: "I wish you success." I only felt a hot current rolling endlessly.

Four months later, my safety became a problem, and then I hid here and there until the enemy surrendered. I have not received any news from Shi Ming since we separated, but I believe that he is definitely still alive, living even more happily and actively. "Friendship built in battle and hardship is the most precious feeling in the world." I cannot forget Shi Ming for this reason. Although he also has many shortcomings, he should be seen as an excellent and staunch son of the Chinese nation. I am waiting for that day to come, to tightly hold Shi Ming's hand, to express our longing, and to pour out our pain and joy.

### Daydream

— Dante Gabriel Rossetti (1828-1882)

Collected by Chen Lie at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London

Rossetti's father, Gabriele, was an Italian poet who fled to England due to political reasons and wandered around Europe. Later, he taught at the Royal Academy in London. His son received early instruction at home and showed his artistic talent early on. In 1848, at the age of twenty, he co-founded the so-called early aesthetic movement with Millais and Hunt, which had a significant impact on academic thought in England and Europe. Rossetti's paintings not only faithfully depict the subtle scenes of nature but also incorporate a deep poetic expression. It is evident that Rossetti was not only a painter but also a poet. He was naturally imaginative, but he was also able to describe his ethereal dreams with a practical approach. Most of Rossetti's paintings depict medieval stories, but in 1857, he created illustrations for the poetry collection of the then Poet Laureate, Tennyson. Rossetti was a master of both watercolor and oil painting. This painting, "Daydream," is one of his masterpieces.

### A Dreamless Night

— Mo Yu

As the gray sky covered the sorrow in every corner of Shanghai, a frenzied joy began to permeate the entrance of Ciro's. Bai Ping stepped into this dance palace, which he was already very familiar with, with unusual emotions today. Just as he was preparing to use the passion in the crowd to wash away the pain that had been eroded by some memories on the road, the manager was already making faces in front of the microphone and raising his voice to shout:

"Miss Bai Ping is here! Does anyone want her to sing a song?" Then, like a torrent of echoes stirred up in a giant valley, the world seemed to be shaken and dazed. Bai Ping held his breath and looked at the hundreds of seductive eyes staring fiercely at him in the dimly blue light and mist of the room. The torment of the past week forced him to put on a smile, so he began to sing:

"I will buy that dream... long ago and far away, I dreamed a dream one day and now that dream is here beside me!..." "What a sweet dream!" In the clamorous atmosphere, as long as one person shouted strangely, it would immediately cause a widespread commotion, because this was everyone's opportunity to show off their charm. They all greedily wanted to find their own desired dream in Bai Ping, so as soon as the song was over, Bai Ping slowly took his dreamlike dance steps in the crowd.

After Bai Ping turned over eight or nine partners, he realized that many of the unfamiliar dancers today were actually philanthropists. They were participating in a charity dance to aid the refugees in northern Jiangsu with great enthusiasm. The words "northern Jiangsu refugees" undoubtedly contained a revealing irony for Bai Ping's reality. He was afraid that this would touch the deeply wounded souls in gorgeous clothes here, so he tried his best to forget everything and pressed his smiling body even closer to the guest on the tenth partner.

"Miss Bai Ping's English is too good!" This was a middle-aged, gentlemanly stranger.

"He's an authentic college student!" The manager always wanted to promote the dancing girl.

"..." Bai Ping glanced at the manager with disgust. This kind of glorious boasting was already regarded by him as a malicious provocation to his own sadness; the gentlemen were smart, and they immediately understood and dismissed the manager, so they changed direction and attacked the depths of her soul! "I believe Miss Bai Ping has a light and beautiful dream!"

"How do you know?"

"Didn't you just sing that you had a dream in the distant past, and this dream is leaning against your side! ... Is this dream allowed me to step into its edge and possess it like you, to get a little warmth?"

"Don't misunderstand! There is only bitterness and pain in my dream!"

"Why?"

"The eight-year War of Resistance turned my warm home into a dilapidated household, so I began to have bitter dreams. After the victory, even this only dilapidated household property was destroyed by the artillery fire of the Communist Party; I not only couldn't study, but also became a refugee, and now all I have is a painful dream!"

Bai Ping gradually began her habitual sobbing again, but the environment here did not allow her to have this contradictory sadness; as soon as she looked up, she saw a waiter excitedly shouting in front of the microphone:

"Everyone, if you drink one more cup of tea today, you will save one more life! Although we live a hard life in this lowly profession, we will never forget the many tens of thousands of refugees who are living in exile, so I am willing to voluntarily dedicate my small account and wages for one day today, I want to exchange my personal pain for the happiness of tens of thousands of them!"

A thunderous applause awakened Bai Ping's melancholy about dreams, and a new revelation swirled in her mind, she seemed to immediately firm up a new belief:

"I have already fallen into the fire pit, I can't let those kind people repeat my footsteps again, isn't it time for me to sacrifice myself now?" Thinking of this, Bai Ping very skillfully put on a smile that was very suitable for the atmosphere in this room. This smile was quite stimulating and seductive, and the gentlemanly stranger leaned closer to him:

"Miss Bai Ping! Pain can strengthen your will, and bitterness can also inspire your courage, why should you be sad?"

"Yes, I already have courage and determination now!"

"I also want to learn from them today and let those thousands of refugees temporarily gain a little happiness and relief!"

"Are you going to donate everything you have?"

"Yes, I am going to start selling my dreams to anyone for charity now!"

When Bai Ping finished saying this sentence, she stood up, her entire beauty of line was simply like a wriggling meat pillar, (this meat pillar shone with infinite vitality that made people intoxicated; these, coupled with the statement that she had just made that made people retreat, immediately unfolded a scene of fierce and gorgeous competition, this gentlemanly consultant had already stood in front of the microphone and was shouting with all his strength:

"Everyone, I believe this is a very painful good news!..."

The room was filled with a rare silence.

"Miss Bai Ping is now willing to sell her dreams to anyone for charity! ... Although her dream is a little bitter, it is absolutely complete; although her dream is mixed with pain, she hopes that someone can give her happiness! Because... because she is going to exchange her greater pain for the happiness of thousands of refugees in northern Jiangsu tonight!" This middle-aged gentleman seemed to be hoarse from being excited by the enthusiasm, but he still stubbornly continued:

"A complete dream cannot be estimated for its value, and the situation is a great act of charity! So I... I am willing to use 200,000 yuan to..."

Before he could finish this sentence, the entire scene had already stirred up a wave of cheers.

"I'm willing to offer 500,000!"

"I'll offer a million!"

"I'll offer...!"

Without the slightest hesitation, without a trace of stinginess, countless flavors of sweetness and bitterness were woven into Bai Ping's heart. She knew that she had become a commodity in this kind of occasion, but she was finally sold at the highest price in the arms of an old and bloated merchant:

"I am willing to donate three million to save those helpless refugees, and at the same time I am willing to donate all my strength to make her happy for the rest of her life!" This old philanthropist nodded reservedly.

The success of this transaction gave the people in the scene many different angles of disappointment; the manager approached Bai Ping's side with a blessed and flattering tone;

"You're really going to save a lot of people tonight!"

"What qualifications do I have to save people? I was rescued by others just like those many refugees."

The melody of "I will buy that dream" was played on the stage again, as if to welcome the success of Bai Ping's charity, and as if to mourn the premature death of Bai Ping's youth. There was an unspeakable contradiction in the air in this dance floor. When people were leisurely chewing on the remnants of their dreams with a trace of dreaminess, Bai Ping was pulled into the car by that bloated and old merchant-like gentleman: "You can disappear from those bitter dreams of the past from now on?" The gentleman intimately put his arm around Bai Ping's waist.

"But, isn't this society constantly creating fresher bitter dreams?"

"But, ... but you shouldn't think of those painful dreams tonight at least."

"Yes, my dream tonight has been exchanged for the happiness of thousands of people, I should be happy."

"The happiness of those thousands of people is indirectly built on your painful sacrifice. You can be proud of this great act of charity!" The old gentleman smiled ingratiatingly.

"Maybe..." Bai Ping stammered a little.

Outside the car window, the long summer seasonal wind was gently fluttering. The melody of "I dreamed a dream one day, and now that dream is here beside me" was thrown far away by the car. Bai Ping saw clearly through her crystal tears that the entire Shanghai was a dreamless night in the smoke and dust of the wheels!

Notes taken on July 27th, 35th year.

### Two Snapshots Shanghai Young Master

— Shao Fu

The Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association has now decided to hold the "Shanghai Miss" election to help the disaster relief. It concerns the lives of 3.5 million refugees. No one has anything to say and of course fully agrees, but after the charity dance, there will be a "Shanghai Miss" again, which seems to be too much work for the female compatriots, and the men will inevitably feel uneasy!

I would very much like to suggest that the gentlemen of the Relief Association, after the "Shanghai Miss" election, hold another "Shanghai Young Master" or "Shanghai Young Noble" (the name may be discussed in more detail) election, so as to raise donations to help the disaster relief, and saving lives is the top priority, the more the better. As for the method, it is up to the gentlemen of the Association to use their brains.

Movie Advertisements

Before the War of Resistance, movie theater advertisements were most stimulating. Some people said that it was because of their status. The higher the status, the more they could "show off," but in fact, even if the status is small today, it is still moving. Here are a few sentences at random:

1 Singing and dancing, showing all their skills, jade legs like a forest flying all over the sky, wonderful songs and popular songs.

2 Exhibition of human beauty, soft and fragrant jade, cooling the eyelids; sublimation of song and dance art, bone-eroding and soul-destroying, grabbing the heart.

3 Sour, hot, angry.

4 Dry firewood and raging fire, the unmarried sister-in-law takes a fancy to the eldest brother-in-law, and her heart is greatly moved.

That's enough, no more examples.

Watching movies can be said to be the most affordable and beautiful entertainment today, but I think if you don't have money or time, you can also have enough entertainment by looking at movie advertisements.

### A Joke That Can't Be Made A Sudden Siren

— Zhong Jun

It was a little after 6 p.m. on Sunday afternoon, and I was at a relative's house preparing to have dinner. The siren went off, and we all heard it very clearly. In any case, the siren would not be sounded at this time. Some people said that the siren was malfunctioning; however, the sound was very long and never stopped. Then another siren sounded. So, we had to turn on the radio to hear what was going on. However, the radio was playing music loudly, and there was no report other than advertisements.

Everyone began to feel nervous. We can't really be blamed. Everyone in Shanghai or the interior has personally experienced what a siren means. Moreover, we all know that Warsaw, London, and even Pearl Harbor have all experienced this kind of sudden siren. A person who has just left the war will not forget the horrors of war so quickly. So, phone calls were made. But no one knew what was going on, not even the security authorities.

The tense atmosphere became even thicker!

I suddenly caught an inspiration and immediately announced: "If this is a siren, then it should be an all-clear signal! Because only an all-clear signal will sound a long tone to the end. An air raid alarm should be one long and two short." People thought about it carefully and felt it made sense. And at this time, dinner was served, and the bubbling beer made us forget about this siren altogether.

The next day, when I opened the newspaper, I found out that the electric wire was broken; the citizens did not know the truth, and were just frightened in vain, etc. It was said so lightly, as if the average person did not even have the knowledge that the siren was malfunctioning.

I don't think we're being paranoid. If this siren had sounded in a major European or American city, even the police who didn't know the truth would have advised people to go to air raid shelters. It's not that we have the shadow of war in our hearts. In this era, people have to guard against some accidents that seem almost impossible. And if the siren that is responsible for transmitting the alarm to the citizens of the city also makes a joke or two, the terrible consequences can be imagined.

The siren is as sacred and correct as the bell in a church. It controls the actions of the entire city; it will never, and must not, be messed with!

Therefore, when the siren is automatically activated due to a malfunction, all measures should be taken to cut off the current immediately; in any case, it should not be allowed to continue sounding for as long as ten minutes. At the same time, the security authorities must be notified immediately, so that the radio station, police cars, or other possible methods can be used to notify the citizens not to panic; in any case, people must not be left in the dark about what is going on for several tens of minutes. Moreover, afterwards, it must not be left unannounced! At least an announcement should be issued to explain the reasons, and in order to prevent the future, the citizens should be told how to distinguish between a real alarm and an "accidental alarm."

This is not making a mountain out of a molehill. Everyone knows the story of the boy who cried wolf! The siren is related to the safety of the entire city, and it cannot cry wolf even once!

### A Very Strange Thing

— A Su

If you have the opportunity to go to the old capital—Beiping, you will definitely see two typical characters in the tram. Just a shake or a nod of the head, and the conductor will tacitly let them pass without having to buy a ticket. Their special terms on the tram are "shake-head ticket" and "nod-head ticket." But you have to have special qualifications. Sometimes, people try to impersonate them, moving their heads in a way that resembles a shake or a nod, hoping to pass. But the conductor has very sharp eyes. Seeing that he looks neither like a ××× nor a loafer, he will loudly ask the person, "Sir, are you a shake-head ticket or a nod-head ticket?"

### Calligraphy Exhibition

— Li Juqing

Yesterday, at the invitation of a friend, I heard that the Ningbo Fellow Association was holding a solo exhibition of calligrapher Ren Cixiang. I had long admired his name, so I drove over in the afternoon. I saw many couplets and scrolls hanging on the four walls, in regular, cursive, clerical, and seal script, each style distinctive. His writing used both dryness and moisture appropriately, achieving a perfect balance.

Through a friend's introduction, I finally got to know him. Mr. Ren was humble, kind, and amiable. He answered every question earnestly. When asked about his learning, Mr. Ren said that he had been studying calligraphy for decades, only imitating the ancients, experiencing the ancients, silently contemplating the deeds of the virtuous people of the past, being sincere and not seeking shortcuts, diligently and assiduously, thus enjoying great fame. Whenever I face the ink pool, my heart and soul are drawn to it, but I regret my own dull talent, unable to follow in the footsteps of the ancients.

Moreover, in studying calligraphy, one must pay particular attention to character. The ancients said that literature carries the Way and poetry expresses aspirations. Reading books clarifies the principles of sages and worthies, and calligraphy is the expression of one's personality revealed in form and substance. The profoundness of art can be seen in the brushstrokes, revealing whether a person is virtuous or unworthy. For example, if a person is honest and kind, their writing will be simple and steady; if a person is frivolous, their writing will be light and fleeting; the uninhibited are bold, the disciplined are precise, the trendy are charming, and the noble are pure and unrestrained. This is an immutable principle. Therefore, the rise and fall of calligraphy is also related to the fate of the nation. It can greatly change customs and practices, promote national prosperity, and also provide textual research and supplement deficiencies in classics and history. As for the skill of the art, it is actually secondary. Hearing these words, one can see his lifelong research.

### "Smart" and "Fool"

— Ling Zhuoyan

Regarding students, those who secretly read novels, yellow weeklies, or movie magazines in class; write notes to each other; or ask someone to take their place and go to the movies or dance halls are considered "smart" students. Those who can skip grades, buy diplomas with money, "pass" tests by cheating or carrying cheat sheets are "smart."

Those who listen carefully in class, study hard after class, don't dance, don't know how to flirt, and rely on their true abilities to pass exams, advancing one grade at a time, are all "fools."

Those who know how to dress up, using charming smiles to win love, using lavish manners and clothing to win admiration; when they become old and unattractive, discarding one spouse and marrying another; when their wealth and power decline, divorcing one spouse and marrying another are the most "smart" at love and the most "modern" in marriage.

What mutual understanding, shared interests, sharing joys and sorrows, and growing old together are all things that "fools" do.

When they need you, they are devoted and righteous, but when they don't need you, they discard you like worn-out shoes, treating you like a stranger. This is the most "smart" way to make friends.

What making friends with loyalty and trustworthiness, sharing hardships together, are all things "fools" do!

In society, those who know how to socialize, bribe, boast, flatter, scheme, avoid responsibility, be opportunistic, benefit themselves at the expense of others, be servile to superiors, and be imposing to subordinates are the "smart people" in life!

Embezzling and taking advantage of loopholes is what "smart people" do.

Serving the public faithfully, being loyal to one's duties, and upholding justice are the biggest "fools" in the world!

Those who secretly hoard goods for profit, commit illegal acts, but on the surface pretend to be benevolent and righteous, loyal to the country and the people, establish charitable organizations, public undertakings, and universally save all living beings, and thus get promoted and become wealthy and prominent are the great "smart people"!

### Not Worth a Smile

— Ben Hui

Doctor: "After so many days of injections, why haven't all the bacteria in your body been killed yet?"

Patient: "Then may I ask the doctor to inject some DDT, because that is the only magic medicine for killing insects and will definitely work immediately."

Father: "You good-for-nothing! You've even started learning to dance!"

Son: "Dad! I'm learning to dance for the disaster victims in northern Jiangsu, because this charity dance will help the disaster victims!"

### "People's Grievances" and "Officials' Secrets"

— Fang Jun

The Political Department of the Guangdong Military Headquarters recently convened a symposium of Guangzhou trade associations. Forty-four trade associations, represented by more than fifty people, attended. The chairman asked them to frankly state the pain and difficulties they had experienced in their respective industries, whether political or personal. The conclusions were entirely attributed to political issues. The political pain and difficulties were corruption—one law enacted, one abuse arises; heavy taxes and levies—mines are taxed, mineral products are taxed, businesses are taxed, endlessly; smuggling—organized smuggling: duty-free imported cigarettes flood the market, hitting the sales of domestically produced cigarettes, leading to the closure of more than two-thirds of domestic cigarette factories… The chairman considered it valuable information and said that he would submit it to Director Zhang of the Military Headquarters for instructions, striving to resolve the pain of each industry.

It is said that the significance of the Political Department convening this symposium was to follow Director Zhang's intention to eliminate the separation of "past situations not reaching the top" and "to understand: 1. How to solve the current economic downturn; 2. Where the difficulties in commodity circulation lie; Whether the current tax levies can be reasonable and convenient for the people; 3. How to strengthen communication between labor and management and promote welfare undertakings to avoid labor disputes." Of course, the above three points also contain political elements, but what the representatives of the trade associations stated contradicted this political nature in many ways, going a step further than what Director Zhang had intended to understand. This could not help but make the chairman (Secretary Xie Zhennan of the Political Department) consider it valuable information.

In fact, this kind of valuable information is "readily available" in Guangzhou. Perhaps not only in Guangzhou, but in what part of the Republic of China is there not such valuable information? It was just that Director Xie happened to hear a few thousandths of it. However, the fact that Director Xie considers it valuable information shows that the Political Department of the Military Headquarters intends to investigate people's grievances. However, unexpectedly, what was investigated was "officials' secrets." This can imagine how Guangzhou, after the victory, is in the deep and fiery waters of all kinds of "officials' secrets"!

Perhaps the victory gave the people of Guangzhou a courage they had never had before! A few months ago, they dared to tear down the sign of the Good Salvation Branch, and now they dare to expose "officials' secrets" in front of officials. The sentence "one law enacted, one abuse arises" is very powerful, directly pointing out that officials enact a law in order to create an abuse. Secondly, the automobile transportation industry vaguely pointed out that those "local bullies" ride cars without paying and transport goods without paying. In particular, tobacco merchants explained the source of duty-free imported cigarettes and the organized smuggling. These bold accusations are what the officials have long been familiar with. However, being able to be disclosed in the newspaper is considered much more "democratic" (?).

It can be said that Guangzhou's industry and commerce took a mild laxative at that symposium. The accumulation in their chests seemed to have cleansed their intestines and stomachs in the atmosphere of the meeting place. However, whether these accusations will have a fermenting effect remains to be proven by future facts, that is, after Director Zhang's instructions and the "striving to solve." Perhaps Guangzhou's industry and commerce are now very worried, worried that what they provided will only be regarded as "valuable information," "valuable" to the point of being treasured and never having the opportunity to be made public in the future.

Guangzhou's industry and commerce are truly worthy of sympathy. During the ten months since the victory, they have suffered all kinds of grievances that only those involved can understand, especially the various exploitations in the political chaos of the early days of the victory. Now that the Political Department of the Military Headquarters has created this political style, I think it should not disappoint people, right?
