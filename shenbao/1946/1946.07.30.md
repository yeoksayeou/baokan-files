### The National Army in Northern Jiangsu Advances on Two Fronts; Dongtai and Xinghua Will Soon Be Recovered; The Main Force of the Communist Army Retreats Towards Hongze Lake

[Report from Our Zhenjiang Office, 29th] The situation in northern Jiangsu today is on the verge of full-scale development. According to an announcement by the military today: (1) The National Army advancing from Taixian towards Xinghua, after crossing Zhoujia Village, immediately split into two advancing forces. One advanced northeastward, and the other advanced directly northward. On the 28th, they recovered Laoge (36 li from Xinghua) and Shenjialun (District 8 of Dongtai) in one fell swoop. The Communist troops along the way were routed at the mere sight of them, and are retreating eastward towards Beimao Mountain and westward towards Fanchuan respectively. The National Army advancing from Laoge entered Shiliting on the 29th and is now setting up positions. The Xinghua county seat is already in sight. The National Army advancing north from Shenlun has crossed Zhuhong Port and is advancing towards Dada. The people, hearing of the arrival of the National Army, brought food and drink, cheering and welcoming them on both banks of the rivers. This area is mostly swampland, and the rice paddies are turning from green to yellow, and the harvest is imminent. However, many of the strong young men in the villages have been forcibly driven away by the Communist Party. (2) A certain unit of the National Army advancing eastward from Haian crossed the two towns of Fuan and Anfeng on the 28th and entered Liangdui on the 29th. The Dongtai county seat is also in sight. (Reporter's Note: Dada is the center point between Dongtai and Xinghua on a straight line, 60 li from Dongtai in the east and 60 li from Xinghua in the west. If the National Army enters Dada, the rear and flanks of the two county seats of Dongtai and Xinghua will be attacked, and they can be recovered together in a matter of days).

[Report from Our Taixian Office, 29th] On the right wing front in northern Jiangsu, the battle has been in a stalemate for days due to rain. The National Army has advanced to the vicinity of Qutang in Haian, but there has been no major progress so far.

[Report from Our Zhenjiang Office, 29th] Military news: (1) The main force of the Communist army in areas such as Jiangdu, Liangtai, and Liuhe has gradually retreated towards Hongze Lake since the 29th. (2) There are no main Communist forces in the area from Gaoyou to Huaiyin, only remaining remnants of militia. Furthermore, according to military news from Xuzhou, in the area west of Muyang, the Communist army that invaded from southern Shandong, due to the fierce fighting in Shaojiadian, set up more than 30 heavy artillery pieces on the north bank of Muyang on the 28th and continuously bombarded the south bank. Civilian houses within ten li were destroyed by the artillery fire.

[Report from Our Jiangyin Office, 29th] In the Zhengdongwei area of Liuxu Port, Jing County, about 800 Communist troops defeated by the National Army landed on the Shengangkou of Chengxi by boat on the night of the 28th. They were discovered and intercepted by the Navy in the Yangtze River and were defeated. Furthermore, the tense situation on the outskirts of Jingyi has been slightly eased due to the arrival of a large number of elite National Army troops crossing the river to reinforce the defense.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 29th] The Communist army's attacks on the outskirts of Xuzhou are becoming increasingly fierce. The main forces of the 4th Brigade of the 2nd Division, the 7th Division of the 4th Division, and parts of the 7th Column of the 3rd Division have all been increased to the area west of Suining to join the offensive. On the morning of the 28th, Yugou and Chaoyangji in the southeast of Xuzhou were captured. The two Communist forces that attacked Shicun Town (southeast of Xuzhou) and Changzhigou (east of Lingbi) were repelled by the National Army after fierce fighting. Taking advantage of the momentum, the National Army passed through Sixian on the 28th and attacked the rear of the Communist army. Yangcun north of Tianchang and Nipeihai and other places in the northwest were attacked by Communist troops newly arrived from Xuyi on the 27th and were all repelled by the National Army. North of Yangzhou Yihui, fighting continues to be fierce. The Communist guerrillas who disturbed the area of Dingyan Town north of Nantong have been completely driven out.

[Reuters, Nanjing, 29th] Reporting on the war, it is heard that Marshall and Stuart have drafted the following six suggestions: (1) The Nationalists and Communists should jointly issue cease-fire orders in various regions; (2) Neutral zones should be demarcated to facilitate the work of battlefield groups; (3) The government should be reorganized as soon as possible before the National Assembly, so that all parties can participate in the government when formulating the constitution; (4) The most important resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference should be implemented; (5) After the ceasefire, the battlefield groups should cooperate closely with the Ministry of Communications; (6) The garrison areas and the number of troops of the Nationalists and Communists should be determined.

[United Press, New York, 29th] The Howard newspapers commented in editorials: Even if Chairman Chiang invites the Communist Party to participate in the government, it is difficult to guarantee that the Chinese civil war can be ended. The newspaper said: We do not want a red China to appear, nor do we want China to become a vassal of the Soviet Union. If Chairman Chiang allows the Communist Party to participate in the government as encouragement, the Communist Party will make a mountain out of a molehill. The Communist Party once refused to reorganize and unite with the National Army to resist Japan, and internal strife occurred, hindering the anti-Japanese united front. The Soviet Union denied international communism during the war and pretended to want a strong and democratic China to appear, but the Soviet Union still marched forward courageously, advocating international communism. Then the coalition government has lost its purpose and meaning, and is still acting as the fifth column for the Soviet Union in various parts of the world today. Their policy is to dominate others or let others perish.

### Marshall Returns to Nanjing Today; Ambassador Stuart's Illness Gradually Improves; The Chairman Sends Personnel to Express Condolences

### Enlarged Memorial Week in Kuling; Chairman Chiang Personally Delivers Instructions; Summer Academic Lecture Series in Jiangxi Opens

[Report from Our Guling Office, 29th] Chairman Chiang personally presided over the Memorial Week of the Summer Camp this morning and gave instructions, encouraging the students to have a consistent attitude in academic research, integrating spirit and practice to achieve the purpose of applying what they have learned, and to accomplish the mission of national construction.

### On the Assassination Case of Li and Wen; Director Long Issues a Statement; Hopes Newspapers Will Not Publish Incorrect Reports; Tang Zong Ordered to Fly to Kunming Today to Participate in the Investigation

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] Long Yun, Director of the Military Council, recently issued the following statement: The government attaches great importance to the assassination case of Li and Wen and has repeatedly dispatched senior officials to the scene of the incident to thoroughly investigate. Before the case is clarified, all parties should take an extremely objective attitude and wait for the government's report to clarify the truth. In recent days, a few newspapers in Nanjing and Shanghai have made irresponsible reports on the case, involving private individuals and speaking with great certainty, without knowing the source of their information or what basis they have. However, whether it is information provided by outsiders or obtained through self-reporting, once it involves private individuals, they should bear legal responsibility. It is hoped that before the government officially announces the results of the investigation, newspapers will not rashly publish irresponsible reports on this case.

[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 29th] Regarding the assassination case of Li and Wen in Kunming, according to our reporter's investigation, the government is still conducting a strict investigation. Because the inside story is more complicated, it will not be announced rashly until the truth is completely determined. According to reports, Long Yun's second son, Chunzu, was originally the acting commander of the 24th Division. The soldiers of the division were unwilling to be transferred to the Han region for reorganization, so they fled one after another. For this reason, Chunzu came to Nanjing a few days ago to report. He will have a casual dinner with Chief Chen tonight and personally report the situation to Chief Chen. It can be said that this matter has nothing to do with the Kunming Li and Wen case. As for Long Yun's third son, Chunzeng, because of his past indiscrimination in making friends, he did have irregular behavior. His father repeatedly warned him but he did not change. Outside speculation may be from this.

[Central News Agency, Guling, 29th] Tang Zong, Director of the Police Department, came to Guling to meet with Chairman Chiang. After reporting on his trip to Kunming, he was instructed to participate in the investigation of the assassination case of Li and Wen under the guidance of Commander-in-Chief Gu Zhutong. At 7:00 AM on the 29th, he left Guling for Xunyang to fly to Kunming. Zhang Zhenguo, Director of the Lushan Summer Camp Office, and others accompanied him.

[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 29th] Tang Zong returned to Nanjing from Guling this afternoon and is scheduled to fly to Shanghai and then to Kunming tomorrow morning. Reporters attempted to visit, but were refused.

### U.S. Military Attacked by Hundreds of Communist Troops En Route from Tianjin to Peiping; Our Military Authorities Send Troops to Rescue

[Report from Our Peiping Office, 29th] Cai Wenzhi stated that 100 U.S. soldiers were coming to Peiping from Tianjin this afternoon. A conflict with the Communist army occurred near the Anding Station. The government has sent troops to assist.

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 29th] Military News: Thirty-one U.S. soldiers, riding in eleven trucks, traveled along the Peiping-Tianjin Highway this afternoon and were suddenly attacked by more than 300 Communist troops of unknown designation near the area of Da and Xiao Sha River north of Hexiwu in Yangcun. There were casualties among the U.S. soldiers. Upon hearing the news, our military authorities dispatched troops to rescue.

[United Press, Peiping, 29th] Local authorities state that over a hundred U.S. Marines, traveling by truck from Tianjin to Peiping, were attacked by Communist troops in the central area of Peiping and Tianjin at Anding Station at 3:30 PM today, resulting in casualties among the U.S. Marines. Tonight, military officials stated that National Army reinforcements had arrived at the battlefield to assist the U.S. Marines, and that the U.S. Marines had returned fire, resulting in heavier casualties for the U.S. side than for the Communist troops. The Communist troops ambushed the train from strategic points along both sides of the railway. United Press reporters attempted to obtain an official detailed report on the battle from the U.S. Marine Corps headquarters, but were unable to do so because only military officials were given priority to telegraph to Tianjin tonight. According to the National Army, several passenger cars on the Peiping-Tianjin train carrying the U.S. Marines were suddenly fired upon as the train arrived at Anding Station and passengers were boarding and disembarking. It is reported that two U.S. Marines and several passengers were injured. According to government authorities, the U.S. Marines returned fire in self-defense. The number of Communist troops is unknown, but it is believed to be considerable, enough to intrude upon China's main transportation line. Informed sources believe that the fighting will continue tonight, as National Army reinforcements have already arrived at the battlefield. According to informed sources, in addition to an extra train carrying National Army troops from Peiping, several hundred small units have also been dispatched along the railway line from nearby areas. Political circles here believe that this incident is very important, as it is the first large-scale conflict between the Communist army and the U.S. Marines, with both sides opening fire on each other.

### Chairman's Life in Kuling: Frugal and Organized, But the Work is Even More Intense

— Special Correspondent Xie Baozhu from Our Guling Office

Chairman Chiang's daily private life is simple, plain, frugal, and organized. The amount of time spent working is greater than the amount of time spent resting. This is not only well known by the people of China, but also admired by foreigners. After arriving in Lushan, the Chairman's frugal life and hard work did not become easier because he was in a picturesque and poetic environment. On the contrary, the Chairman's life became even simpler, and his work became even more intense.

Every morning, at the latest by seven o'clock, the Chairman must get up. Sometimes he gets up at five or six o'clock. After getting up, he and his wife pray on the balcony on the second floor of the official residence for half an hour. If it rains, they hold the prayer in the study instead, without interruption. The Chairman always uses cold water to wash his face in the morning, and he also wipes his body with cold water before going to bed. Every morning, he also does half an hour of stretching exercises, and then reads on the balcony. He even recites the Great Learning and the Doctrine of the Mean aloud. He doesn't just read them, but recites them aloud for about ten minutes. If you walk along the quiet Hedong Road, you can faintly hear the sound of his recitation in the sound of the spring water hitting the rocks. After finishing the exercises, he goes to the office to read official documents and handle various important matters. Sometimes he also drafts outlines for speeches. Another important task is that he must call important party, government, and military officials every morning to instruct them on the matters that should be handled.

He has breakfast at nine o'clock. Because the Chairman's teeth are not very good, the food is very simple and easy to digest. His breakfast is mostly a cup of milk, two slices of bread fried in butter and then toasted, two scrambled eggs, and some sugar, slightly heated. Sometimes he also eats porridge, noodles, or similar things.

After breakfast, he takes a walk near the official residence and pays close attention to the cleanliness of the surroundings. Whenever he sees an untidy place, he immediately sends someone to clean it up. At the same time, he must inspect the dormitories of the attendants' office every two out of three days to see if they are neat and tidy and whether they are working diligently. Speaking of the attendants, the Chairman must individually summon the attendant officials twice a year. In addition to inquiring in detail about each person's life and family situation, or reprimanding and guiding them in person if they are found to have an improper lifestyle, he also encourages them to study diligently in terms of knowledge. He personally excerpts several books, such as ancient books or the Chairman's own words and deeds in "China's Destiny," and asks them to read them in detail within half a year. When they are summoned in the second half of the year, they must be questioned on the spot about what they have gained after reading them.

He starts seeing guests at 10:30 AM. The people who visit the Chairman are of course distinguished guests from China and abroad. Some are specifically summoned by the Chairman for official business, and some are just visiting. If there is a gathering, he goes out at this time.

He has lunch at 1:00 PM. The lunch is quite simple, usually four dishes and one soup, two meat dishes and two vegetable dishes. He often eats chicken soup or uses chicken soup to cook vegetables. The Chairman and his wife do not like to eat greasy food very much. Their favorite dish is "stir-fried beef with onions," and stir-fried green vegetables are also common. The Chairman not only does not smoke or drink, but he does not even drink tea, only drinking plain water. When entertaining guests, he also uses plain water instead of wine. After the meal, he eats some fruit. There is not much fruit on the mountain, and the Chairman and his wife often eat watermelon.

After the meal, he takes a nap for half an hour, at most an hour, and then continues to work. He sees guests between 3:00 PM and 6:00 PM. If there are not many guests, he continues to work. At 4:00 PM, he eats some refreshments, which are similar to breakfast.

Around 6:00 or 7:00 PM, he takes a walk with his wife or invites a few guests, sitting and talking by the creek. He spends the most time with Mrs. Marshall. Then he invites the guests back to the residence and has dinner around 8:00 PM. From 9:00 PM to 11:00 PM, he goes back to the office to work, planning the work for the next day or deciding which personnel should be summoned. He also calls various places to inquire about the progress of the matters entrusted to various officials. He goes to bed at 11:30 PM. Before going to bed, he meditates for 20 minutes, reflecting on the gains and losses of the day. He makes a note of any failures or difficulties so that he can improve his planning and seek solutions.

Apart from walking, picnicking, or playing checkers, the Chairman has no entertainment. There is a radio in the official residence. When he is free, the Chairman listens to Peking opera records. The Chairman is very interested in Peking opera.

The Chairman's clothes are also exceptionally simple and plain. The materials are very ordinary. When meeting with guests, he wears a blue robe and black mandarin jacket when meeting with civil officials, and a Zhongshan suit or military uniform when meeting with military officials. He mostly wears a Zhongshan suit when going for a walk, but sometimes he also wears a military uniform and a long robe and mandarin jacket. On Sundays, he goes to the small church across the street to worship.

The Chairman's wisdom, ability, and memory are truly unmatched. Every time he goes to a place, he has already studied the local map. He is not only familiar with the terrain, but also very clear about the geology. Once, the Chairman and his wife took their entourage to Lulin to play, and another time they went to Doctor's Nest to tour. When they came back, they should have gone back the same way, but the Chairman said that another road could be taken, and it was closer. But everyone did not know it, so they tried it. As a result, they did get home. This happened several times. Another time, the Chairman and his wife and Mrs. Marshall were out for a stroll. They walked along a tree-lined road. The soil was like cement, soft and loose, and felt like cotton when stepped on. The Chairman told Mrs. Marshall that this kind of soil was very different from other soils, and that it was only found in Kuling. No one else knew about it. After hearing this, they could not help but admire him in their hearts.

Finally, there is one more thing that must be mentioned, and that is the Chairman's love for the people. Whenever the Chairman is walking in the forest or on the street, the people stand at attention from a distance to salute. The Chairman always tells them not to be formal and to pass by as they please. When he sees that the people's clothes are untidy, he tells them to button them up. If their hands and feet are dirty, he tells them to wash them clean. In addition, whenever the Chairman sees a minor soldier, he always orders the entourage to take him back to the official residence to inquire about his number and his unit. He immediately summons the chief officer of the unit to tell him not to let minor children be soldiers and orders him to be reassigned elsewhere.

Lushan is not a big place, and the Chairman often goes out for walks or attends gatherings, giving the people on the mountain many opportunities to see the Chairman. They feel that the Chairman is kind and approachable, like seeing their own father. No wonder that when they shout "Long live Chairman Chiang," the loud and enthusiastic sound moves and excites everyone. (Sent from Lushan on July 27)

### The Franco-Vietnamese Conflict Intensifies; The Plight of Overseas Chinese in Northern Vietnam; France Violates Agreements and Arbitrarily Increases the Burden on Overseas Chinese

[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 28th] Over ten thousand overseas Chinese in Northern Vietnam are today trapped in an extremely complex political vortex. Although the armed conflict between France and Vietnam has subsided, the political struggle is intensifying. Every struggle between the two sides directly or indirectly affects the overseas Chinese, as the commercial sector in Northern Vietnam is currently in the hands of overseas Chinese. The Franco-Vietnamese Agreement of March 6 stipulated that Vietnam has fiscal autonomy. However, the banknotes currently circulating in Vietnam are issued by the French-operated Banque de l'Indochine. The bank, citing factual needs and with the approval of the French government, increased the issuance of Vietnamese currency by 2.2 billion yuan after March 6. The Vietnamese government believes that this increase in banknotes violates the Franco-Vietnamese Agreement and undermines Vietnam's fiscal autonomy, and therefore prohibits its circulation. However, the Vietnamese government has not effectively prevented the French commercial bank from issuing new banknotes, but only passively suppresses the use of the banknotes. As overseas Chinese are more involved in commercial activities, they hold a significant amount of banknotes. Therefore, the Vietnamese authorities often search overseas Chinese shops and residences and arbitrarily confiscate the banknotes owned by overseas Chinese. The number of overseas Chinese whose property has been damaged as a result is very large. The French Commissioner's Office in Northern Vietnam announced that Chinese merchants do not need to declare and pay taxes when their goods enter and exit various ports. Simultaneously, the Vietnamese Ministry of Finance also announced a tax regulation, stipulating that Chinese merchants should pay taxes to the Vietnamese government when their goods enter and exit various parts of Vietnam. The Vietnamese government considers the French notification to Chinese merchants that they do not need to pay taxes as a violation of the Franco-Vietnamese Agreement. After the Vietnamese government announced the tax regulations, it immediately began to set up customs inspection stations in Haiphong and other places to levy taxes, and set up inspection stations on major highway transportation routes. No overseas Chinese goods can pass without being heavily taxed. Although the goods of overseas Chinese that have been taxed by the Vietnamese government do not need to be taxed when they pass through areas controlled by the French, the French believe that having paid taxes to the Vietnamese side is a violation of the Sino-French Agreement and have filed several protests with our consulate in Hanoi and Haiphong. The French side also informed our consulate that the French side is fully responsible for protecting all the lives and property of overseas Chinese in accordance with the Sino-French Agreement. However, in reality, the footprints of overseas Chinese are all over Vietnam, and the French only reach the larger cities. According to the Sino-French Agreement, overseas Chinese should be consistent with the French side, but in reality, it is impossible. Serving both Qin and Chu makes the hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese in Northern Vietnam deeply feel their difficult situation.

[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 28th] Nine hundred overseas Chinese who returned to China from Shanghai on the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Hai Chuan arrived in Haiphong on the afternoon of the 27th. These overseas Chinese were originally part of the French army's overseas forces. The Vietnamese authorities will reorganize them and have them join the Vietnamese army to continue their service.

[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 29th] Overseas Chinese in Heyang on the Yunnan-Vietnam border, due to their location in the conflict zone between the two Vietnamese parties, are in a difficult situation. In addition to sending representatives to Hanoi to appeal to all parties for relief, a week ago they also sent representatives Huang Yujin and Nong Yongfu to Changlipo on the border to negotiate with the Vietnamese authorities. Before the trip, they had obtained the consent of the Vietnamese side and were issued passes. Unexpectedly, on the 22nd, while returning to Heyang, they were suddenly ambushed by several armed Vietnamese two kilometers near the Vietnamese military camp in Qingshuihe. Huang Yujin was shot twice and his thigh bone was fractured, and Nong Yongfu was kidnapped and went missing. After this news reached here, the overseas Chinese were shocked. Because the official representatives of the overseas Chinese were illegally ambushed and went missing by armed Vietnamese, they have requested our consulate in Hanoi to negotiate with both the French and Vietnamese sides.

### Our Ships Sailing in the Nanyang Region; Goods Repeatedly Confiscated by the Dutch; Indonesian Government Increases Import and Export Taxes

[Central News Agency, Batavia, 28th] According to the Tian Sheng Daily, Chinese ship merchants sailing in the Dutch harbors and between Java and Singapore are facing a very difficult period, because the Dutch authorities continue to confiscate their goods at sea, and the Indonesian government has increased import and export taxes to an alarming extent. The newspaper stated that in the first half of July alone, about 9,000 bags of white sugar loaded on two Chinese cargo ships were arbitrarily confiscated as enemy property by Dutch warships before they arrived in Cirebon. The Chinese cargo owners had already paid a high export tax of 200% to the Indonesian authorities for this batch of white sugar. It is estimated that each bag of this white sugar would be worth about 1,000 Dutch guilders after arriving in Cirebon. Imported goods from Singapore and other places, such as cigarettes and bicycles, are forcibly purchased by the Indonesian navy at low prices or directly confiscated.

[Central News Agency, Batavia, 27th] The Dutch ship Cibadak departed from here last night for various ports in China, carrying 1,600 Chinese passengers.

### Communist Troops Breach the Dike of the Ji Canal; Southwest of Cang County Becomes a Waterlogged Area; Water Levels in Rivers North of Tianjin Rise; The Great Southern Embankment is Under Emergency Repair

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 29th] On the 27th, the west bank of the Grand Canal at Zhao Zhuangzi, southwest of Cang County, was breached by Communist troops for more than ten zhang (about 33 meters), and the area within thirty li (about 15 kilometers) became a waterlogged area. It is currently being repaired.

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 29th] The water level in the rivers around Tianjin continues to rise. According to Deputy Mayor Du Jianshi's announcement on the 29th, the risk of flooding this year is very high. The municipal government and water conservancy agencies have stepped up prevention measures and may be able to eliminate the crisis. He also said that some lawless people had deliberately destroyed the embankments of various rivers, attempting to cause a major disaster, but fortunately it was discovered early and disaster was avoided.

[Local News] The Executive Yuan announced: The water level in the rivers north of Tianjin in Hebei Province has suddenly risen in recent days, and the situation is critical and very worrying. The Executive Yuan and the Tianjin Municipal Government are now working together to repair the Nanda Tou Embankment to prevent flooding.

### Regarding the Shibuya Incident; Taiwanese Compatriots in Qingdao Offer Suggestions

[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 28th] The Qingdao Taiwanese Compatriots Association hosted a press conference on the 28th regarding the Shibuya Incident. Chairman Zhang Ruilin reported that Taiwanese people have been subjected to violence and abuse by the Japanese for 51 years. Unexpectedly, after the victory, after returning to the motherland, the old ways of the Japanese returned, killing our innocent people. He requested the government to severely punish them and put forward six suggestions: (1) Severely punish the superintendent of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department; (2) Extend the occupation of Japan for 50 years; (3) Make Japan a permanent agricultural country; (4) Compensate the losses of the victimized Taiwanese compatriots; (5) Immediately send national troops to jointly occupy Japan; (6) Guarantee that the same incident will not happen again.

### The Major Robbery Case on the Nanjing-Wuhu Highway; Solved After More Than a Month of Investigation

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] The shocking case of bandits robbing seven vehicles in a row on the Nanjing-Wuhu Highway on the 16th of last month has been solved after a month of close investigation by the Capital Garrison Command, with the assistance of the Shanghai Garrison Command. Judging from the actions of the perpetrators in the entire case, it is clear that they belonged to an organized group that repeatedly committed robbery cases on Dongjiadu, Xieqiao, Dangtu, and Nanjing-Wuhu routes in Shanghai, and had premeditated robberies on the Nanjing-Shanghai, Dan-Li and other highways. The main offenders include Chen Tianru (real name Chen Jun), Huang Xinhai, Zhang Yongqing, Dai Changrong, Wang Tiancai, and others, who make a living by robbery. Among them, Chen, Huang, and Zhang were once arrested and sentenced to death, but escaped from prison and returned to their old profession.

### British Navy in Hong Kong Takes Over Hong Kong-Kowloon Transportation

[Our Newspaper, Hong Kong, 29th] Following the Yaumati Ferry, the Star Ferry went on strike at 4 pm on the day that the new British Ambassador to China, Stevenson, passed through Hong Kong, and transportation between Hong Kong and Kowloon was cut off for a time. British naval personnel immediately took over the Star Ferry and continued to operate. This is the first time that the British Navy has taken over water transportation between Hong Kong and Kowloon since the Hong Kong General Strike in 1923. Outside the Star Ferry pier, crowds lined up to wait for the ferry. Military police were everywhere, maintaining order. Small boats and speedboats also joined in carrying passengers across the sea, charging one Hong Kong dollar per person. The Star Ferry workers are only about a hundred people, but their impact has already thrown Hong Kong-Kowloon transportation into chaos.

Increasing Rice Production in Western Zhejiang; Professor Jin Da Plans

[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou Communication] Professor Ying Kanggeng of the Department of Agricultural Economics of Jinling University, taking advantage of the summer vacation and at the invitation of Zhang Rongchu of Linghu, led more than ten students to Tanglou, Linghu, and other places in western Zhejiang to investigate agriculture for two months. In addition to the publication of various special research reports, Ying was particularly interested in the great hope for increasing rice production in western Zhejiang. He specifically drafted the "Plan for Increasing Rice Production in Western Zhejiang" for reference. It is heard that the plan was drafted with extremely accurate and conservative figures, and focuses on improving irrigation and drainage tools and increasing the application of fertilizers. It is estimated that each municipal mu (about 0.067 hectares) of paddy field will require a one-time permanent investment of 20,000 yuan in water conservancy tools, and an annual investment of 15,000 yuan in fertilizers, and each municipal mu of paddy field can increase production by 5 to 15 municipal dou (1 dou is about 10 liters), or the value of 25,000 to 75,000 yuan, and the increased production of straw and winter crops is not included in the calculation. It is believed that the lack of water conservancy tools and fertilizers in the farmland of western Zhejiang has a significant impact on production. It is heard that after the plan is drafted, it will be distributed to all relevant sectors to call attention.

### The Great Obstacle to China's Peace

Peace, peace, in China today, is truly in accordance with the will of Heaven and the response of the people!

The Chinese people need peace; the Chinese government also needs peace. After eight years of arduous war, the Chinese people long to return home, long to go home, long to restore normal life, and naturally sincerely seek peace. Yuan Xiluo, an elder of Jiangsu, is willing to fast and bitterly persuade, which is a representative of the urgent call for peace from the Chinese people. President Chiang has always advocated a "political solution" and proposed to temporarily divide the troops' garrison areas, waiting for reorganization in accordance with Marshal Ma's plan, as a concrete way to stop military conflicts. President Song even made it clear that "if there is no peace in the country, there will be no way to solve the financial and economic problems." This is especially the most frank expression of the government's need for peace.

Not only do the Chinese people and government need peace, but many of our allies also need China's peace. President Truman's statement on China policy last winter, the dispatch of Special Envoy Marshall to China, the new appointment of Ambassador Stuart, and the recent visits of Marshal Ma and Ambassador Stuart to Beijing and Guling, and their mediation despite their illness, are all facts that the United States desires peace in China. This policy of the United States to promote the peaceful unification of China is not only considered correct by the United States. According to the communique of the Moscow Three-Power Foreign Ministers Conference last December, Britain and the Soviet Union also agreed that "a unified and democratic China under the National Government is needed, that broad participation of all democratic elements in the National Government is needed, and that military conflicts need to be stopped immediately." It can be seen that all allies also eagerly hope that China can truly and quickly achieve peace.

The Chinese people and government, as well as China's allies, especially the United States, are so eager for peace, but peace has not yet been achieved, as if it can be hoped for but not attained. Where is the crux of the matter?

The Communist command platform in Yan'an, and the Communist spokespersons in various places, and even the friends who cheer for the Communists, have recently been clamoring that the reactionary elements in China and the United States are using the stationing of the US military in China and the US aid to the National Government to create a civil war in China. According to their distorted propaganda, it seems that as long as the US military withdraws from China and the US stops aiding China, China can achieve peace; if so, then the US's enthusiastic aid to China from the war period to the post-war surrender would not be as the saying goes, "wanting to be good turns into evil," and these speakers who speak nonsense fully show their "ungrateful" nature. Any Chinese person with a conscience will certainly not have this view.

We believe that the great obstacle to China's peace is that the Chinese Communist Party only knows how to follow the lead of foreigners, and has no national concept and national consciousness at all. Because of this, the CCP is equal to a soulless body, it cannot make its own decisions! The CCP is not like the British Communist Party and the American Communist Party. First, it has no ideas of its own, and second, it only knows how to expand its army by taking advantage of opportunities, and does not know that at a certain stage, it has become too big to fall. The peace negotiations between the government and the CCP, from the invitation of Mr. Mao Zedong to Chongqing in August last year, have been delayed for nearly a year, so they have always been hot and cold, intermittent, and the root cause lies in this. To put it bluntly: To see the future of China's peace, it seems that we should not only look at Yan'an, but also look further at Moscow. If we only measure the climate of peace between Nanjing and Guling, I am afraid it will be somewhat blurred. Former US Undersecretary of State Welles said in a broadcast on the 28th: "Moscow, in view of the increasingly tense relations between the United States and the Soviet Union, has instructed the CCP leaders to reject fair and constructive solutions in the KMT-CPC negotiations." Mr. Welles' words are probably said after he saw a little more clearly.

However, we cannot blame Moscow, but we should explore two points: (1) Why do people willing to accept instructions from Moscow emerge among "Chinese"? (2) Why can the CCP, which accepts orders from Moscow, actually grow on Chinese soil? These two points are really the key to why China cannot achieve peace today.

Point (1) is nothing new. Every country has such people, the only difference is the amount. Since "Chinese" had traitors like Wang Jingwei and Pu Yi who were willing to obey the Japanese invaders in the past, then how can we guarantee that no one will obey Moscow? Therefore, this point alone is not enough to cause concern for China's peace.

Regarding point (2), we have to blame the government! We fought the war of resistance, and everyone knew that it was to fight for the country's independence and autonomy, so why could the CCP, which obeys Moscow, grow in China? During the eight-year war of resistance, the CCP made distorted propaganda to the outside world, but the government remained indifferent and did nothing, first. The CCP is absolutely flexible and active in fighting and negotiating, while the government is passive everywhere and perfunctory in everything, second. The CCP actually exploits the people, but verbally boasts of implementing the Three People's Principles, and even expands the propaganda of its land distribution policy; but the government leaves the legacy of "those who cultivate have their own land" unattended, and puts the soil law, factory law, land policy, agricultural and industrial policies, and social policies passed by the central government on the shelf, as if these laws and policies are just decorations, third. Finally, at the beginning of the victory, the government neglected the responsibility of giving the people a peaceful and prosperous life, but only saw the Communist Party with guns, thinking that as long as the Communist Party was fed with the method of "dividing political power," the world could be peaceful. As a result, the CCP saw the government's psychological weakness, launched an uprising, attacked cities, and seized land, and the government initially just stood by and suffered passively, begging for peace, not only unable to save the people from dire straits militarily, but also unable to give the people hope politically, fourth. Because of these four reasons, the CCP is content with the usability of past techniques, and repeatedly uses its usual technique of "talking and fighting," and China's peace is still hoped for but not attainable. In short, we must look at the issue of China's peace in conjunction with the issue of international peace. Not only because world peace is indivisible, but really because the CCP, which obstructs China's peace, is a link in the world communist party. Mr. Welles said it well: As relations between the United States and the Soviet Union become increasingly tense, the CCP rejects fair and constructive peace plans. Not only that, but the CCP has further launched anti-American propaganda in China to echo Moscow's broadcasts and newspaper arguments. Dulles' "Soviet Foreign Policy" in Life Magazine says that the Soviet Union divides the world into three zones: Tannu Uriankhai and Lushun are in her "internal zone;" Outer Mongolia, Xinjiang, and the nine northeastern provinces are in her "intermediate zone;" and the whole of China is one of her countries in the worldwide "peripheral zone." The CCP's actions within China probably meet the needs of this "peripheral zone." We must first recognize this inside story, and then we can prescribe the right medicine for China's peace and remove this factor that hinders peace.

### French President Bidault Elected Chairman: Opening Address of the European Peace Conference: Hope to Eliminate the Scourge of War Forever: Two Committees Established to Discuss Procedural Matters

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Paris, 29th - Live Broadcast: The long-publicized peace conference finally opened two hours ago (midnight in Shanghai). Attlee, Byrnes, Molotov, and Vyshinsky arrived one after another. French President Bidault first announced the opening of the conference, followed by a ten-minute speech, which was met with thunderous applause. Mr. Bidault delivered the speech in French; the original text is being translated. The main points are two: (1) Hoping that peace can bring the tranquility that this corner of Europe needs most. (2) To forever prevent the scourge of war. After the speech, the conference unanimously elected Bidault as the chairman of the peace conference, and subsequently appointed two committees to discuss procedural and other issues.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 29th, United Press] At 4 p.m. today (midnight in Shanghai), representatives from 21 countries, seated on red velvet chairs in the Luxembourg Palace, listened quietly to the speech of French Prime Minister Bidault, representing the French government, welcoming the guests from various countries. This Paris Peace Conference will not actually stipulate a peace treaty, but will only allow the small countries that have contributed to the Allied victory to state their views on the peace treaty and how peace can be achieved. Then, the Four Powers will weigh these suggestions before drafting the final peace treaty. Byrnes said he hoped that the representatives of the 21 countries could sign this peace treaty during their time in Paris, and that the defeated countries could also state their opinions. It is generally believed that the conference has great power and will be used to formulate a treaty with Italy, as this treaty includes the issues of Italian African colonies and Trieste. The Latin American delegation is openly seeking lenient treatment for Italy, but the Soviet Union and its satellite states are quite demanding of Italy.

[Reuters, Paris, 28th] After the opening of the 21-nation peace conference, the procedural rules proposed by the Four Powers will be discussed. The Four Powers, who drafted the treaty, and the other 17 countries are expected to have their first conflict here. The main point of the procedure is to divide into committees to discuss each of the five peace treaties. Whether in the plenary session or in the committee discussions, a two-thirds majority voting system will be adopted. In principle, this procedure is only a suggestion that the 21 countries can accept, modify, or reject. If accepted, the Four Powers only need one-third of the supporters to prevent any country from proposing amendments to the draft treaty. It is generally expected that some Allied countries that have not participated in the drafting of the treaty will inevitably criticize the work of the Four Powers. The most vocal among them is expected to be Australian Foreign Minister Evatt. As for the five former enemy countries, they have also been invited to state their opinions. It is thought that Italy and others will certainly use this opportunity to express their opposition to the draft. The Four Powers spent nearly a year negotiating the draft treaty, and will naturally strongly refute the dissenting opinions of other countries.

### Draft Peace Treaty to be Released Today: Four Nations Have Reached Agreement

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] San Francisco, 29th - Broadcast: According to well-informed sources, the conference of foreign ministers' representatives of the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France has decided to publish tomorrow the contents of the peace treaties drafted by the foreign ministers' conference with Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland. They will be released simultaneously in London, Washington, and Moscow.

[Reuters, Paris, 29th] British Prime Minister Attlee and Byrnes held talks this afternoon for a long time, but the topics of discussion were not announced. However, delegation sources believe that it involved the Palestinian issue. It is also reported that the issue of releasing the draft treaty was also raised.

### Key Points of the Treaty with Italy

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 29th] The draft peace treaty with Italy, drafted by the four foreign ministers, will be submitted for discussion at the peace conference that opens today. The key points are as follows:

(1) The Italian border should be in the state of January 1, 1938, except for special cessions. (2) The French-Italian border will be slightly modified. Italy should cede several kilometers in the Saint-Pénat Pass, the Cime de Sines, the Mont Thabor area, the Chaberton area, Tende-La Brigue, and La Roya. (3) The border between Italy and Yugoslavia should be delineated according to the border line proposed by France. The entire area east of the line should be transferred to Yugoslavia. The Free Territory of Trieste will be established within the "French Line". (4) Italy should conclude a technical agreement with Austria to ensure the free passage of northern and southern Tyrol. (5) Italy should cede all sovereignty over the Dodecanese Islands to Greece, and the area will remain a demilitarized zone. (6) Italy recognizes and respects the sovereignty and independence of Albania, as well as Abyssinia. (7) Various permanent fortifications on the Italian border, whose firepower can reach French territory or territorial waters, should be removed. Various military facilities along the Yugoslav border should also be destroyed. (8) Italy should pay reparations of $100 million to the United States within seven years, and reparations to other countries will be determined separately. (9) Within 18 months after the implementation of the peace treaty, Italy should give special treatment to member states of the United Nations until Italy signs trade agreements with the United Nations.

### Abolition of Special Privileges in China

[Agence France-Presse, 29th] The key points of the part concerning China in the draft treaty with Italy to be discussed at the 21-nation peace conference are as follows: (1) Italy abandons all interests and privileges in the final protocol signed in Beijing in September 1901 (i.e., the Boxer Protocol), and all its appendices and supplementary documents. Italy agrees that the above-mentioned protocol and its attachments should be annulled. (2) Italy abandons any demands under the indemnity. (3) Italy agrees to cancel the lease right of the Italian concession in Tianjin and hand over any documents belonging to the concession archives preserved by the Italian side to the Chinese government. (4) Italy abandons its rights to the Shanghai and Xiamen International Settlements and agrees that the above-mentioned settlements should be returned to the Chinese government for governance.

### De Gaulle Delivers a Speech: Advocates for an Alliance Between Britain and France: Opposes German Unification and Centralization

[Agence France-Presse, Bar-le-Duc, France, 28th] General de Gaulle delivered a speech here, stating that Europe, based on the friendship between Britain and the United States, should act as a balance between the two major blocs of the United States and the Soviet Union, impartially. If the people of Britain and France can establish a basic agreement, dedicated to peace, with the same joint efforts as in wartime, it will be of great benefit to the world. Creating peace and strengthening organizations to protect peace is very temporary and fleeting, and we should make timely efforts. However, at this moment, there are still some key points, especially the German issue, that separate Britain and France and prevent them from moving towards unity. French peace depends on the solution of Germany's destiny. Regardless of the difficulties Germany encounters, Germany is still Germany. In other words, it is a great nation in the heart of Europe. Although it has fallen into a deep abyss, it still does not forget the glorious achievements of the past. If it can get a chance to revive, it will engage in war again. For this reason, France opposes anything that would make Germany a unified and centralized country again. The solution to the German problem proposed by France is the most practical. The German states, such as Prussia, Bavaria, Württemberg, Baden, Hesse-Palatinate, and the Rhineland, can all retain their traditional names and implement autonomy, but the armaments factories in the Ruhr area should be placed under international control, the Saar area should be returned to France, and some places on the western border of Germany should be ceded to Poland. As for the security of Germany's neighbors, it should also depend on the Oder River and the Rhine River. In addition, the atomic energy control plan proposed by the US government seems very reasonable to France.

### France Seeks Security: Bidault Clarifies Position

[Agence France-Presse, Saint-Étienne, France, 28th] On the eve of the opening of the European Peace Conference, French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Bidault delivered a speech here, stating that if France is in a dangerous state, then no country in the world will be safe. Therefore, France insists on the guarantees necessary for its security. The fate of the French people is at stake, and the relationship is too great. Therefore, it is important to find a way to eliminate the precarious situation that French security is currently facing.

### Ireland Plans to Apply: To Join the United Nations: Decides to Abandon Neutrality

Prime Minister de Valera told Parliament in a clear tone that after Ireland becomes a member of the United Nations, it should fulfill its duties. If it wants to evade its obligations, it will be extremely unfavorable. It should uphold the determination to abide by the law and jointly participate in its execution.

Machines that replace labor and concentrate power in the hands of a few will not be tolerated. He also said that he is an opponent of violent means, so he will not be a part of seizing power through general strikes. But if unfortunately there is a break, he may have other ways.

### Our Chairman's Leniency Towards Japan: Japanese Congressman Says Gratitude Should Be Conveyed to Our Country

[Reconstruction Agency, Tokyo, 29th] Liberal Party Congressman Kitagishi questioned the government at the general headquarters of the House Budget Committee today, saying that Japan carried out a war of aggression against China, and China fought hard to resist and finally won. The current situation of the Japanese nation is certainly sad, but China should still be congratulated for its victory. After China's victory, it was quite sympathetic to the Japanese people, especially Chairman Chiang's statement on taking a lenient attitude towards the Japanese people and Japanese expatriates in China. However, Japan currently has no international status and is in a situation where it cannot repay China's kindness. In the future, it may be possible to use cultural exchange methods. At present, can we convey the gratitude of the Japanese people to Chairman Chiang to China? Yoshida replied: Chairman Chiang's post-war statement on Japan is naturally appreciated by the Japanese government and the public, and I am also very moved. Recently, I have heard that Japanese returning from China have praised the Chinese government's handling as generous, and facts prove that the government should express its gratitude. However, Japan currently has no diplomatic relations with foreign countries and has no diplomatic powers, so it cannot express its gratitude. I hope that it can find a way to express its gratitude to China as soon as possible.

### Former Professor of Jinling University Recounts in International Court: A Glimpse of the Bestial Acts of the Japanese Army in Nanjing: Another Witness Describes the Tragic Situation He Experienced Personally

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 29th Special Dispatch] Bedes, a former history professor at Jinling University, today commented on the various acts of rape, massacre, arson, and looting committed by the Japanese army in Nanjing in the International Court, and the courtroom was filled with an atmosphere of terror and astonishment. Bedes was previously a member of the International Security Zone Committee. He estimated that the Japanese army committed about 20,000 cases of rape in Nanjing, and at least 12,000 civilians were massacred. This number does not include people who were identified as former military personnel. During Bedes's statement, he hesitated because the details contained unspeakable terror and misery. The court president Webb asked the witness not to be reluctant to narrate because what he intended to mention was too terrifying. Bedes then said: The Japanese army raped women, regardless of day or night, sometimes even on the street. One woman was gang-raped by 17 Japanese soldiers in a public cemetery. A girl as young as nine years old and the girl's 76-year-old grandmother were raped in Nanjing city. Japanese soldiers in teams of 15 to 20 often entered the security zone day and night to search for women, and even the wives of university professors could not escape the ravages of Japanese soldiers and lose their virginity. Bedes recalled the situation of the Nanjing Massacre and said: The most treacherous and vicious thing was undoubtedly the Japanese army's trick to lure Chinese people to their deaths. At that time, Matsui Iwane, the commander-in-chief of the Japanese army, issued a notice saying that Japan treated Chinese soldiers with goodwill. The Japanese soldiers told the former Chinese soldiers that if they joined the labor corps, everything could be forgotten. However, when some former Chinese soldiers admitted their past identities, they were lined up by the Japanese soldiers and swept away with machine guns. In addition, 200 Chinese civilians were shot by the Japanese army on the night they left the Jinling University campus. Bedes described the looting of the Japanese army as an organized and consistent act, and testified that the Japanese soldiers, under the command of officers, used trucks to transport away the loot, taking away any items anytime, anywhere. The Japanese army even often tore down and destroyed the American flag and refused to respect the property of the Americans, who were still neutral at the time, and even the private property of German nationals was occupied by the Japanese soldiers. Bedes also mentioned the arson atrocities of the Japanese soldiers, saying that after the fall of Nanjing, for a long time, there was constant arson. Earlier, Xu Jun, the Shanghai manager of the Far East Development Company, testified that in May 1942, when he passed the Yunnan-Burma Road, he witnessed 703 corpses of Chinese people killed by Japanese soldiers. The Japanese soldiers looted the belongings of these civilians, then made them sit in a circle (Xu Jun was also in it) and swept them away with machine guns. When the machine gun fired, Xu Jun immediately bent forward. The people on both sides of him were killed, and their bodies fell on him. The next day, he saw about 1,000 corpses of civilians, who were either shot or stabbed to death with bayonets.

### Large Numbers of American Missionaries Return to the Far East

[United Press, New York, 28th] Four hundred Christian missionaries are scheduled to take the ship Lincks from San Francisco to work in China and the Philippines on August 28. According to Elson, secretary of the Foreign Missions Board of the North American Church, the number of missionaries going abroad is the largest this time. They will land in batches in Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Manila. As soon as traffic is smooth and supplies are convenient, no fewer than 8,000 members of Christian congregations will return to the Far East and the Pacific Islands to preach, and the 400 people who are departing this time are their pioneers. American missionaries and their families have been waiting for ships on the West Coast for several weeks. In order to solve the transportation difficulties, the church authorities chartered two ships, and the Lincks is the first of these "church ships."

### A Lesson Learned from the Pearl Harbor Incident: The U.S. Decides to Deploy a Spy Network, with Lee Hee and Vandenberg Taking Charge

[United Press, Washington, 28th] The United States has resolved to deploy the most comprehensive spy network abroad. U.S. Army and Navy authorities, learning from the Pearl Harbor attack, have issued a warning, stating that the United States cannot be a victim of such attacks again. If the enemy attacks again, it will undoubtedly use a large number of devastating atomic bombs. The United States will not be able to concentrate its forces and launch a counterattack in one or two years, as it did in the last war. Only by foreseeing the crisis can the United States avoid the catastrophe. President Truman, in response to these warnings, has ordered the establishment of a

National Intelligence Agency

Its mission is to plan, develop, and coordinate U.S. intelligence activities abroad. It will be headed by Secretary of State, the Army and Navy Departments, and President Truman’s personal representative, General Lee Hee. The President has also established the Central Intelligence Group as the executive arm of this agency, with Lieutenant General Vandenberg as its director. The executive arm will assist the National Intelligence Agency in formulating plans and policies and will organize and disseminate various foreign intelligence collected by federal departments to relevant U.S. government agencies for reference.

Central Intelligence Group

has now been established, but it will not actually participate in the collection of foreign intelligence. This task will be left to representatives of the State Department stationed abroad, Army and Navy intelligence personnel, and other appropriate agencies. However, this plan has various limitations, preventing the existing agencies from competing with the high level of effectiveness of British secret operations. One of the restrictions is the traditional American opposition to conducting espionage in friendly foreign countries or spying on other countries' private affairs. The Director of the State Department's Office of Intelligence and Research, Loon Chiu, frankly stated, "If the United States wants to have a spy network, it cannot be created within the State Department. We

do not engage in clandestine activities

or spy around. Ambassadors and their staff cannot perform this dirty task. Their actions must befit their diplomatic status." The Army and Navy intelligence authorities share the same view. Most Army and Navy representatives stationed abroad are Army and Navy attachés stationed in dozens of embassies and legations. If their actions offend the government of the host country, they will be recalled. The Deputy Director of Naval Intelligence, Lunt, stated, "U.S. naval attachés must obtain intelligence through legitimate means." The Army Department's intelligence authorities said the same.

The U.S. Office of Strategic Services

made great contributions during the war. Its personnel are now assisting in the organization of peacetime intelligence agencies. The Office of Strategic Services was disbanded last year, and its research division was taken over by the State Department, consisting of 500 people, including historians, geographers, anthropologists, and other experts. The intelligence division of the Office of Strategic Services was transferred to the Army Department. The State Department formed a research division, led by Loon Chiu, to analyze intelligence materials. The experts will conduct extensive and organized research, covering many geographical areas, such as the Ruhr area, the Turkish Straits, and the situation in Italy. As for the Director of the Central Intelligence Group, Vandenberg, he is an optimist. He stated, "We have great plans and rich ideals, but we are currently in the organizational stage. Please give us time and support, and we will surely succeed."

### One of the Four Grain Officials in the Grain Loan Embezzlement Case, Yang Xizhi, Returns to China and Arrives in Shanghai. After a Two- or Three-Day Stay, He Has Gone to Beijing to Report Everything. Rumor Has It That He Went to the Garrison Headquarters to Surrender

[Reported by this Newspaper] The grain loan embezzlement case, since it was reported by the Supervisory Yuan, has been investigated by military and judicial authorities for months, but there is still no clear result. In recent weeks, the progress of the case has been particularly slow, which has caused great concern among the public. Therefore, the reporter yesterday again visited Director Tseng of the Military Law Department of the Garrison Headquarters. According to him, the case has not actually been shelved in recent months, but because the主管 authorities repeatedly ordered subordinates not to disclose information to the outside world without authorization, it is inconvenient to report the extent to which the investigation has progressed. However, it can be said with certainty that the judgment of the case will be based entirely on legal principles, and sufficient evidence will be provided regardless of guilt or innocence. When the reporter asked whether the judgment of the case must be made after answering the relevant points requested by Minister Hsu, Tseng smiled and talked about other matters, only saying that the case should be announced around the sixth or seventh of next month. The reporter learned that one of the four grain officials reported, Yang Xizhi, the former Special Commissioner of the Shanghai Municipal Grain Administration, returned to China from the United States a few days ago and arrived in Shanghai. After staying in Shanghai for two or three days, he went to Beijing the day before yesterday to report to the Ministry of Food on his trip to the United States to attend the UN Food Conference and order foreign rice. As for the rumor that "Yang Xizhi surrendered to the Garrison Headquarters after returning to China," I specifically asked Tseng about this. Tseng said that he had not heard of this. It was also learned that the account books of the grain loan merchants have been checked by accountants, but the report has not yet been sent to the Military Law Department.

### UNRRA's Order to Suspend Shipments of Relief Supplies to China Will Be Lifted, as UNRRA Expresses Sympathy After Chiang's Explanation

[Reported by this Newspaper] UNRRA's order to suspend shipments of relief supplies to China will definitely be lifted within days. A spokesman for CNRRA stated that as of yesterday, the Shanghai office had not yet received a formal notice from UNRRA to lift the order. However, CNRRA recently received a report from its Washington branch that after the UNRRA authorities received the explanation issued by Chiang Ting-fu in Shanghai a few days ago, they expressed considerable sympathy for the difficulties faced by CNRRA's work. Therefore, there should be no problem in principle with lifting the previous order.

### The Minzhong Steamer Runs Aground

The Minsheng Company's Minzhong steamer, which recently underwent repairs, was on its maiden voyage to Yichang. A few days ago, it sailed through Hankou. Yesterday, the steamer sent a telegram reporting that it had run aground 40 miles downstream from Yichang. It is currently telegraphing Yichang to send a steamer for assistance and to unload the cargo to reduce the weight and make the ship float.

### Numerous Passengers and Cargo on the Northern Shipping Route, but No Ships to Load. The Linsen and Hanyang Steamer Will Sail to Shantou and Qingdao Today

[Reported by this Newspaper] According to news from customs brokers, commercial transportation on the Nanyang route has been relatively smooth for several weeks. The China Merchants Bureau's Linsen steamer will depart today for Shantou and Wan Fuzhou. The Haiwan steamer is scheduled to sail directly to Guangzhou on August 1. The Dengjian steamer is scheduled to sail to Xiamen on the same day and Wan Fuzhou on the return trip. Although the Minsheng and Sanbei companies occasionally have ships going up and down the Yangtze River route, passenger and cargo transportation has not been satisfied. The China Merchants Bureau's commercial transportation only opened one Jianghan steamer to Hankou in the middle of last month. It returned to Shanghai from Yichang last Saturday with grain from Sichuan. Although it has been decided to sail to Hankou, the exact date has not been determined, and it is feared that passengers and cargo will be difficult to register. As for the Northern shipping route, there are numerous passengers and cargo, but there are no ships to load for the time being. Even several thousand tons of relief supplies are waiting. Even if ships sail north, they can only transport relief supplies first, and passengers and cargo are still hopeless. Customs brokers urgently hope that the China Merchants Bureau will find ways to allocate ships to reduce losses in various industries. It is also reported that the Taikoo Company's Hanyang steamer will sail from Shanghai to Qingdao this afternoon. In addition to the original cargo from Hong Kong to Qingdao, a small amount of cargo has also been loaded in this city.

### The Shanghai Maritime Administration Bureau Will Be Expanded

The Ministry of Transportation will adjust the Shanghai Maritime Administration Bureau. In addition to the Director and the two sections of Administrative Affairs and General Affairs, it will add a secretary, commissioners, a technical section, a personnel office, and a statistics office. The number of personnel will increase from 56 to 80. It also plans to establish offices in Wuxi, Hangzhou, and Haimen.

### High Tide Predicted for Today and Tomorrow

The Huangpu River in this city has been rising since yesterday. Due to the backflow of tidal water from the sewers, there was a small amount of water accumulation in several places on the low-lying roads. According to the Pudong Bureau, the tide will be higher today and tomorrow than yesterday. If it is not affected by wind and rain, there is no need to worry about large-scale water accumulation.

### The Garrison Headquarters Chief of Staff Says Security Can Be Ensured Without Worry

[Reported by this Newspaper] Regarding the security situation in this city, the Chief of Staff of the Garrison Headquarters, Tan Yulin, told reporters yesterday that although the detention centers have recently been overcrowded, most of those detained are soldiers, deserters, and vagrants with untidy clothes. After interrogation, most of them have been released. At present, the security forces have penetrated every corner of the suburbs, and the entire security can be ensured without worry.

### Returning Technical Personnel Feel Disappointed. The Ministry of Transportation's Agencies in Shanghai Jointly Hold a Welcome Party

[Reported by this Newspaper] The agencies of the Ministry of Transportation in Shanghai jointly held a tea party at 4:00 p.m. yesterday on the second floor of the International Hotel to welcome more than 200 road, telecommunications, postal, and aviation trainees who recently returned from the United States. The Deputy Director of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau, Hou Yuhua, and others delivered welcome speeches and reported on the arrangements for receiving them in Beijing. The atmosphere was harmonious. The meeting adjourned at about 5:00 p.m. All trainees will go to Beijing in batches from today to report to the Ministry of Transportation and wait for work assignments.

[Also reported] The reporter unexpectedly discovered an old friend, Mr. So-and-So, who went to the interior four years ago, among the returning personnel from the transportation industry on the second floor of the International Hotel yesterday. After reuniting, they shook hands and greeted each other. Mr. So-and-So graduated from the Department of Mechanical Engineering of Jiaotong University. He originally worked at the Guizhou Quanzhou Machine Factory of the Ministry of Transportation. In April of last year, he passed the trainee examination in Chongqing and flew to Calcutta, then took a cargo ship to the United States. After arriving, he was assigned to work in a factory of a railway company from Chicago to San Francisco. The training method was not to actually participate in work, but to visit and study in various departments. The expenses in the United States were initially paid by the U.S. under the Lend-Lease Act, because the original purpose was to train them to participate in the counterattack. However, with the early arrival of victory, the U.S. stopped supplying and switched to our government bearing the cost. When the reporter asked about his feelings after returning to China, he said that the first thing he felt was the huge difference in the standard of living and the material environment. The returning personnel all felt that Shanghai's narrowness and crowding was like a "pigeon coop." In addition, the government authorities did not seem to have a complete plan for their work after returning to China. Most people still have to find their own way, and they are particularly disappointed with the current general political and economic situation.

### Major General Edgerton Appointed as Director of UNRRA's China Office. Our Government Expresses Full Support

UNRRA Director LaGuardia recently entrusted Special Envoy Marshall to convey a letter to Chairman Chiang, requesting the Chinese government to agree to appoint Major General Edgerton as Director of UNRRA's China Office. The Chairman has instructed CNRRA Director Chiang Qian to reply that the Chinese government fully supports the appointment of Major General Edgerton.

### The Reception Work Investigation Team Accepts Petitions from the People

The Reception Work Investigation Team has actively launched an investigation. The team also sent letters to 90 party, government, and military reception agencies, requiring them to submit a brief report on the process of receiving and handling enemy and puppet materials within ten days. The team will also review the relevant registers at any time. The team has received more than 40 petitions from the people and has begun to review them in detail. As for the people's personal complaints, the team has previously stipulated that they will be accepted publicly every morning at the offices of the Supervisory Yuan and on the second floor of the Bank of China. The Supervisory Yuan will be received by Inspector Cheng Zhongxing, and the leader of the investigation team, Zhang Zhiben, and the committee members will be responsible for taking turns to accept the people's personal complaints every morning at the office of the investigation team.

### The Housing Allocation Committee Is Unlikely to Be Abolished on Schedule

The Administrative Yuan's Shanghai Agencies Housing Allocation Committee is facing difficulties because many houses left by enemy foreigners have been illegally occupied. The committee originally planned to be abolished by the end of August this year, but according to the current situation, it seems impossible. The "permits" for houses that have been approved for residence by various agencies are currently being filled out by the committee and will be completed in about two weeks. The issuance period is around the middle of next month.

### Complaints Can Be Filed if the Radio Station Investigation Is Unfair

Regarding the case of the simple radio stations in this city being shut down by the transportation authorities, the reporter asked the Director of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation, Yu Lu'er, yesterday. According to him, after the restoration of this city, many radio stations were established, reaching more than a hundred. Their call signs and weekly rates were all self-determined and without any standards, which disrupted the order in the air. Not only were the bureau's radio stations affected, but the U.S. military also complained from time to time. If the radio stations that have been eliminated in this city believe that the investigators have acted unfairly, they can file a complaint with evidence. As for the aftercare methods requested by the eliminated radio stations, because they were established without authorization, there may be no legal basis for them.

### The Volunteer Police Force Receives a Washington Award

### Yang Wendao, Who Has Been Imprisoned for Ten Years, Will Be Retried on Schedule. The Wrongful Conviction Has the Opportunity to Be Reversed Due to Victory. As Many as Eleven People Have Been Summoned at the Same Time. Tang Huaiqun Fulfills His Obligations to the End

[Reported by this Newspaper] The Yang Wendao case, which caused a national sensation eleven years ago, may have a chance to come to light recently. According to the case, Yang was identified as the murderer by the Japanese for the murder of Japanese sailor Nakayama Hideio on Guang Le An Road. The first and second trials both sentenced him to death. He then appealed to the Supreme Court, which immediately ruled to send the case back to the original trial court for retrial. Unexpectedly, the war broke out, and the national army moved west. The judgment could not be delivered, and Yang Wendao had to be imprisoned, awaiting execution under the threat of the enemy for ten years. After the victory, Yang's son, Hanzhi, ran around, and in the spring of this year, the Supreme Court approved Yang Wendao's release on bail for medical treatment. The judgment issued by the Supreme Court seven years ago was also delivered last month. It is learned that Yang Wendao has received a subpoena from the Second Criminal Division of the High Court to retry the case, instructing him to appear in court at 2:00 p.m. on August 17 for interrogation. As many as eleven people have been summoned at the same time, including Zeng Yuan (i.e., Zeng Yuanjia) and Yang Jianzhong, who reported Yang to the Japanese police chief as the murderer. In addition, Zhang Chen, a witness who was favorable to Yang Wendao, was also summoned, but it is heard that he was killed by the Japanese a few years ago. Wei Ligong, the forensic doctor who was responsible for examining Nakayama Hideio's body that year, and Zhang Zhirang, the lawyer appointed by the court as Yang's public defender, have also been summoned to testify. As for the lawyer hired by Yang Wendao this time, it is still Tang Huaiqun, who has been running around for Yang for more than ten years without taking a penny of public funds.

### The Manager of the "Legal" Fulai Qianzhuang, Lu Bingyuan, Is on Trial. On the Same Day, the High Court Retries Xu Jiang, Zou Shanbao, and Others

[Reported by this Newspaper] Lu Bingyuan, the manager of "Fulai Qianzhuang," was tried in the High Court yesterday on suspicion of being a traitor. The bank was jointly operated by the wife of the special agent demon Wu Shibao, She Aizhen, the deputy manager of the puppet Shanghai China Bank, Li Zulai, the chairman of the puppet Nanjing Chamber of Commerce, Ge Liangchou, and others, and Lu was appointed as the manager. It was registered in the puppet Ministry of Finance. In name, it deposited money, but in reality, it engaged in speculation and delivered the deposits to the "Central Reserve Bank" as reserves. Lu confessed in court yesterday that he had originally opened Daxinghao with others in Shanghai, engaged in remittance business. Later, he joined "Fulai Qianzhuang" as manager. He admitted that there were 20 million yuan in fake money used as reserves for the "Central Reserve Bank," but he denied speculation. He also claimed that the bank was a "legal" organization. The judge rebuked him for this law being the law of the puppet government. The case was adjourned for retrial. She Aizhen, Li Zulai, Ge Liangchou, and others are currently in custody. They may be questioned for confrontation during the next trial.

A. E. Thiebold, originally from Russia, worked for the Shanghai Municipal Council in the former International Settlement. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, he changed to German nationality and served as a military commentator for the XGRS radio station run by the German Embassy, making distorted propaganda and collecting information about the United Nations for the Axis powers. After the victory, he was arrested by our military authorities and transferred to the judicial authorities for trial. He was retried yesterday, but the defendant still denied the charges. The court adjourned the trial for further questioning.

### Preferential Treatment for Families of Soldiers in the War of Resistance Against Japan. The Municipal Government Formulates Provisional Measures

[Reported by this Newspaper] In order to truly provide preferential treatment to the families of soldiers in the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Municipal Government has formulated the Provisional Measures of the Shanghai Municipal Government for Providing Preferential Treatment to the Families of Soldiers in the War of Resistance Against Japan.

### A Profit of 200%. "Pocket Books" Have the Most Customers. "Life" and "Time" Are the Best Sellers

Judging from the large number of Western books and magazines appearing on the market, the Western book industry seems to be booming.

Generally speaking, the profit of operating Western books and magazines is quite amazing. Just to give two examples: The original price of Life magazine has recently risen to US$15 a year. Calculating that each issue is only about US$0.30, bookstores purchase it at an exchange rate of 2020, costing 600 yuan in national currency, but it sells for about 1,800 yuan on the market, a gross profit of 200%! Taking the recently arrived "pocket books" as an example, the original price is US$0.25. Adding postage or freight, the cost is less than US$0.30. When sold, some sell for 1,500 yuan, and the gross profit is also close to 200%! This is talking about the retail benefits. If customers entrust them to order on their behalf, if they do not directly pay in US dollars, bookstores generally charge at the black market exchange rate, so they make a profit in terms of exchange rates. As for encountering special transactions, the benefits are even more amazing. One day, the reporter met a friend from a fashion company, who said that recently many of their colleagues entrusted a bookstore to order some specialized magazines about fashion from the United States at a price of 6,000 yuan per copy. The original price of this magazine is only US$0.50. In other words, the cost incurred by the Western bookstore owner is only more than 1,000 yuan in national currency.

Although the profits of the Western book industry are so generous, people in the industry are still not very satisfied. They are talking about the hardship of having a large capital and slow turnover. One boss said, "Rather than taking 50 to 60 million yuan to open a Western bookstore, it is better to do other business, even just lending out short-term interest is enough." So now the few larger-scale stores are mostly old stores with a considerable history, or they are opened by friends who are interested in Western books, and their purpose is not just to make money.

As for the magazines that sell best, they are "Life" and "Time." Next are various movie magazines. As for books, the "pocket books" with low prices and good quality have the most customers. (Fan Shi)

### Judgement of Six Traitors. The Case of Qu Bin Is Concluded

[Reported by this Newspaper] The High Court announced the judgment of several traitor cases yesterday morning: (1) Zhang Bingheng and Zhang Yizhi, who used hardware to support the enemy, were previously sentenced by the High Court to life imprisonment and 12 years of imprisonment, respectively. The defendants did not accept the sentence and appealed to the Supreme Court for a retrial. The retrial was held yesterday morning. Zhang Bingheng's sentence was changed to 10 years of imprisonment, and Zhang Yizhi's sentence was changed to 5 years of imprisonment. (2) Wang Luqing, the deputy manager of "Fuxing Bank," was sentenced to 3 years of imprisonment and deprived of civil rights for 3 years. (3) Li Changgeng, a grain merchant, was sentenced to 3 years of imprisonment and deprived of civil rights for 3 years for using food to support the enemy. (4) Jiang Guozhang, an iron casting merchant, was sentenced to 2 years and 6 months of imprisonment and deprived of civil rights for 3 years for using military supplies to support the enemy. (5) Luo Zhiqiang, a secret agent of the enemy constitution, was sentenced to 1 year and 4 months of imprisonment and deprived of civil rights for 2 years.

The case of Qu Bin was concluded on the same day, and the judgment was scheduled to be announced at 9:30 a.m. on August 5. In March 1938, Qu served as the Chief of the Daily Accounting Section of the enemy's Central China Telecommunications Company, bearing the responsibility of providing the enemy with telecommunications technology and statistics. In December 1944, he was sent to North China by the enemy to inspect the electrical machinery in Tianjin and Peiping. In June 1945, he returned to Shanghai and jointly operated Xinhua Electrical Factory with others. After the victory, he was arrested on suspicion of fraud. After investigation, he was suspected of being a traitor, and a public prosecution was filed.

### Swindler Huang Bode - Trial Concluded, Awaiting Sentencing

[Report from Our Newspaper] Huang Bode, a 33-year-old man from Sichuan, falsely claimed to be a deputy minister of the Ministry of Social Affairs, a future captain of the Jiangshun ship of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and a cousin of Qian Dajun. He swindled money and goods and seduced dancer Chen Lili.

### Bathhouse Workers Establish Reorganization Committee, Again Demanding 40/60 Split

[Report from Our Newspaper] The dispute over the profit-sharing ratio between labor and management in the city's bathhouse industry has been ongoing for a long time. The workers are deeply dissatisfied with the labor union responsible for negotiations because the recent arbitration result from the city government has actually reduced their income. They have recently established a "Reorganization Committee" to take over the original union and are scheduled to request the Social Affairs Bureau again today to change the ratio to a "40/60" split.

### Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs is an Implementing Agency, Does Not Determine Any Methods, Released Statistics on Takeover and Handling Yesterday

Regarding the takeover and handling of enemy and puppet factories in this city, the person in charge of the Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs for the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Region stated yesterday: This office was established on September 17th of last year, about a month after Japan's surrender. When the Ministry of Education took over the enemy and puppet factories, it was discovered that some factory equipment and materials had been stolen or lost. For each factory taken over by this office, an original inventory is listed. The personnel of this office and the Japanese handover personnel are responsible for stamping their seals separately as a preliminary basis. Afterwards, this office dispatched personnel to investigate. If the internal equipment did not match the original inventory, a separate handover inventory was created. In addition to investigating the reasons for the discrepancies, a comparative inventory was prepared with reference to the above two inventories as a basis for safekeeping. This office has taken over a total of 646 factory units, of which 133 units have been transferred to affiliated agencies of the Ministry of Economic Affairs for resumption of operations. The remaining 317 units are currently being processed. This office handles the takeover and handling work entrusted by the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau and is an implementing agency that does not determine any methods. For example, all procedures for factory bidding, including valuation, bid opening, and contract awarding, are determined by the Handling Bureau. After the property rights are reviewed and approved, this office is notified to handle them, and personnel are dispatched by the Handling Bureau to supervise the handover. As for factories returned to the original owners, if the Japanese have added equipment, in addition to handing over the original parts, matters regarding the valuation and bidding of nationalized materials are still determined by the Handling Bureau. Communication between this office and the Handling Bureau inevitably takes time. Outsiders are unaware of this and often accuse this office of intentionally delaying the return of factories, which is absolutely not the case. Finally, he stated that this office has always been very cautious in undertaking the takeover, safekeeping, and utilization of enemy and puppet factories, and that all matters must be decided by the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau before being handled. There are very few errors in the procedures. However, with so many employees in this office, there are inevitably some who are dishonest and take advantage of their positions to engage in corruption. We hope that people in the community will maintain close contact with this office to facilitate reporting. If there are any questions about the takeover work, we also hope that they will come to the office to inquire at any time.

### Handling Bureau to Establish Committee for Bidding on Materials

According to sources, the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Region will establish a committee for bidding on materials taken over by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The committee will consist of three members each from the Enemy Property Handling Bureau and the Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, who will be responsible for presiding over the committee's affairs. In addition, the seventh batch of factories to be bid on will soon be announced.

### Collection of Land Tax in Kind in This City Expected to be Converted to Cash, Already Submitted to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Food for Instructions

Starting September 1st, the collection of land tax in kind in the recovered areas will begin. Yesterday, the reporter visited the municipal finance authorities to inquire about the preparations for the collection of land tax in kind in this city. It was reported that the land tax in this city is being levied for the first time, but most of the land is urban, and the agricultural area is only over 500,000 mu (including river islands). Rice and wheat account for the smallest proportion of crops. During the enemy and puppet period, even with high-level collection in kind, only over 440 shi of rice and grain were collected annually. With a dense population and huge consumption, the people's food has always relied on neighboring areas. Land tax has always been paid in currency, and the people have long been accustomed to it. Public opinion in this city also does not favor collection in kind. At the same time, there are no facilities for warehouse storage and transportation, and the collecting personnel lack training. Collection in kind is prone to malpractices in terms of technique. Therefore, it is proposed that the land tax in this city be converted to legal tender in accordance with Article 3 of the Regulations on the Collection of Land Tax in Kind to facilitate implementation. This is currently being submitted to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Food for instructions. The reporter inquired about the standard of collection if the land tax is converted to legal tender in the future. It was reported that the following three methods will be used: (1) Based on the market price, (2) The price is stipulated by the municipal government, (3) Based on the average price of grain in a certain period. As for the tax amount, according to the recent central government regulations, the tax amount per mu was one yuan before the war, which should be converted to four dou, plus four dou for borrowing, plus 30% municipal public grain, totaling nine dou and two sheng.

### To Prevent Theft of Passenger and Cargo at Various Docks, Customs and Port Authority Formulate Simple Rules

[Report from Our Newspaper] Large-scale thefts have been occurring frequently in the warehouses of various docks in this city recently. The losses of cargo owners are considerable, with the amount of losses reaching more than 40% in serious cases, which is truly shocking. This newspaper has previously reported on this matter. Mayor Wu also convened various relevant authorities at the City Government at 3:00 PM on the 18th of this month to hold a meeting on preventing theft at various docks. Many measures were proposed on the spot, instructing various relevant authorities to cooperate in prevention.

The reporter especially visited the Jianghai Customs and Port Authority yesterday. It was reported that thefts of passenger and cargo on docks have been found in all major cities in the world. The only difference is the degree. However, what is most difficult to deal with at present is that some crew members and employees on some ships are also colluding in theft. Therefore, we sincerely hope that the authorities of various shipping companies will do their best to cooperate with the port police. If a theft occurs, they should notify immediately for investigation. The office has also formulated nine simple rules, hoping that the authorities of training ships will pay attention to them: (1) Do not allow unauthorized personnel to board the ship. (2) Personnel serving on the ship or allowed to enter and exit should carry armbands, passes, or identification documents. (3) If unscrupulous elements cause difficulties, please notify the port police immediately by signal or telephone. (4) Arrest thieves, regardless of the size of the case, and send them to the port police. (5) Do not dispose of any theft case without authorization. All theft cases should be reported to the port police for inspection. (6) Do not sell luggage or discarded items on the ship without the approval of the customs authorities. (7) Selling items on the ship is likely to lure unscrupulous elements, resulting in theft cases. (8) Do not use physical objects as wages for painters or small workers, as the items may be prohibited from import by customs or still subject to tax. (9) The port police are willing to dispatch to assist in investigations at any time and place upon receiving a signal or telephone notification. Port Police Headquarters Telephone (office hours) 15529, extensions 37 and 78. Direct outside lines 12371, 50382 and 12796. Telephone after office hours 50382. Port Police Chief's residence telephone 70216.

### Two Russian Criminals who Robbed Cars and Sold Weapons Escorted for Trial

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday morning, the Second Criminal Court of the District Court, presided over by Judge Wu Xiangzu, opened the trial of the case of the White Russian robbery of wealth, car theft, and sale of weapons. It was reported that Russian gangsters Yagoranfu and Borisyukofu made a living by blackmail and fraud. They met the car driver He Guofu through the introduction of American soldiers to "wild chicken" cars. The owner of He Guofu's car was He Kechang, the secretary of the former Third Front Army Command, and the car number was 15319. At 9:00 PM on May 18th, Yagoranfu and Borisyukofu lured He to drive to Yangshupu to see samples under the pretext of selling car tires. Midway, in the desolate area of Jungong Road and Chunjiang Road, Bao took the opportunity to put a rope around He's head in the back seat, intending to strangle him. He resisted strongly and leaned backwards, avoiding death. At this time, the car had stopped. Ya got out of the car and picked up a stone to hit He's head and face, causing him to faint. Then, they robbed him of 50 US dollars and 24,000 legal tender, and drove away. They pushed He out of the car in a remote place and abandoned the car at Haige Road and Ground Road, walking away. After being pushed out of the car, He was discovered by naval personnel, sent to Shanghai East Hospital for treatment, and reported to the police.

The District Procuratorate prosecuted them for robbery and the crime of selling weapons. After the trial at the District Court yesterday morning, the court ordered a postponement for further questioning due to the complexity of the case.

### Philippine Overseas Chinese Basketball Team Returns to Motherland: The Qunsheng Team to Arrive in Shanghai Early Next Month: With an Impressive Record of Six Wins and One Loss in the Philippines: Currently Competing in Xiamen, Soon to Head North

The Philippine Overseas Chinese Qunsheng Basketball Team sent a letter to the basketball committee of this city's Sports Association two months ago, expressing their intention to return to the motherland for a tour. The basketball committee expressed its welcome. However, due to the difficulty in purchasing ship tickets, the trip was delayed until recently. They have now departed the Philippines for Xiamen on the 25th of this month. After competing in Xiamen, they will take a ship to Shanghai. The supervisory committee, considering that the basketball season is over and other issues, had previously telegraphed the team, requesting them to come after the weather cools down in the autumn.

Yesterday, the Qunsheng Team telegraphed their representative in Shanghai, Cai Dawen, stating that they had decided to leave Xiamen for Shanghai in early August, and it is expected that they will arrive at the coast before the 10th of next month.

### Visiting Feng Youlan at Zhang Zhidong's Former Residence

— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper in Beiping, Song Shaobo

In the misty rain, this reporter went to the right bank of Houhai to visit Mr. Feng Youlan, Dean of the Faculty of Arts of Tsinghua University, who is about to go to the United States to lecture. Mr. Feng had only been in Beiping for four days since arriving from Chongqing. When the reporter knocked on the door, it was just as Mr. Feng and his wife were returning from outside. Mr. Feng, who is in his fifties, has grown a thick black beard about four or five inches long, paired with a pair of nearsighted glasses, and wearing a white silk gown, he has the air of a Daoist priest. His wife is young and plump, and seemed to be returning from a walk at a friend's house. After some inquiries, Mr. Feng politely invited the reporter in. Four or five families of Mr. Feng's relatives and friends lived in the two sections of the courtyard, so it was quite messy. Mr. Feng lived in the last row of rooms, which was a very spectacular deep mansion. Its original owner was Zhang Zhidong. With three courtyards in a row, Mr. Feng bought the middle residence before the incident. Mr. Feng said this, pointing to a room at the north end: "Zhang Zhidong died in that room." Mr. Feng's children were sorting books. Although this house had been occupied for eight years, Mr. Feng's books were fortunate enough to remain lost.

Mourning Wen Yiduo

Sitting on an old sofa, we first talked about Wen Yiduo's assassination. Mr. Feng said that this was an irreparable loss to the Chinese academic community. He said: "Mr. Wen is the most accomplished in studying native literature and art after receiving training in Western literature and art. Although there are others, no one can catch up with Wen Guangsheng's achievements. Although he wrote a lot about Tang poetry, Chu Ci, the Book of Songs, and the Book of Changes, they have not been compiled together. The Department of Chinese Literature at Tsinghua University should organize this unfinished work for him." Regarding Mr. Wen's political interests, it is said that: "Originally, he was close to the nationalist faction. After arriving at Tsinghua, he no longer paid attention to politics and buried himself in research. In Kunming, he didn't even read the newspapers for a year or two. However, in the past two or three years, because he was dissatisfied with the political situation, he became interested in politics again, and the result was like this!" Mr. Feng also said: "On the night of May 25th, the night before I left Kunming, we were still together."

Views on the Current Situation

From Wen Yiduo's death, we talked about the current situation. Mr. Feng politely and cautiously did not express much. He said that there are fundamental contradictions between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and that any country has different forces of radicalism and gradualism, opposing parties that overthrow and maintain, but unlike China, where there is so much mutual distrust. Therefore, Mr. Feng believes that it is indeed difficult for the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to come together, but ultimately they "should reconcile," and this can only be built on mutual concessions. Mr. Feng said that he is not interested in politics because he believes that a person's mental time is limited. Focusing on the research of one academic career may lead to success, but taking care of too much makes it difficult.

Comments on the Beiping Student Protests

Regarding the student protests caused by the takeover of major universities in Beiping, Mr. Feng believes that it is right for some people to insist on maintaining the history, spirit, and traditions of the original school. Mr. Feng believes that Normal University should be restored. Judging from the historical scale of Normal University, it should be. However, there is no Normal University organization in the country now, which may be the difficulty for the Ministry of Education not to change the Normal College to Normal University. In short, in his view, the authorities have not prevented the development of schools that meet the conditions such as history and scale.

Going to the United States in Mid-August

Mr. Feng will leave Beiping for Shanghai in mid-August, and then take a ship to Bucknell University in Pennsylvania, USA, to lecture on "History of Chinese Philosophy" for a year. His wife will go with him. According to Mr. Feng, the lectureship in the United States was agreed upon a year ago, so even though Tsinghua University is returning, it is not good not to keep the appointment. The income from lecturing in the United States is about four to five hundred US dollars per month.

The reporter asked Mr. Feng about his research work in recent years. He said: In the rear area in recent years, he has organized and published "New Rational Learning," "New Theories of Events," "New World Teachings," "New Origins of Man," "New Origins of the Way," and recently prepared to publish "New Words of Knowledge," which was printed by his father's Commercial Press. At this time, a junior who resembled Mr. Feng said: "There is no one else who has achieved such great achievements in the study of philosophy!" Mr. Feng repeatedly said, "Not at all!" His Henan accent remained the same.

Talking about his feelings about returning to the north, Mr. Feng said happily: "We are much luckier than the Song and Jin people. After they crossed south, they were unable to return, but we have returned. This is unprecedented in history!"

Mr. Feng also lamented the difficulties of returning. He said: In the past, when we waited for a plane, it didn't count unless we got on it, but recently we have gone a step further, and it doesn't count unless we get off, because we often turn back after getting on. The three schools of the Southwest Associated University, which were originally scheduled to return last winter, have not yet returned to the chaos of the civil war, which has affected everything. Mr. Feng, who did not want to express his opinions on the current situation, also shook his head and sighed. When the reporter said goodbye, he saw one of his students of many years come to greet him. (35, 7/24)

Civil Administration Briefs

### Executive Yuan Reiterates Order: Civil Servants May Not Hold Concurrent Positions: Municipal Government Issues Circular to All Agencies to Strictly Comply

The Executive Yuan, upon the order of the National Government, believes that the state establishes offices and assigns responsibilities, each with its own specific duties, originally expecting officials to exert their strength in their positions and have no distractions. If they take on other tasks in addition to their primary duties, serving multiple roles, they are bound to neglect one thing and lose another, leading to exhaustion. This will not only make it difficult to achieve governance, but also disrupt official norms. It has long been stipulated in the Civil Servant Service Law that civil servants may not hold other official positions or concurrent jobs, and the government has repeatedly emphasized this over the years. Previously, according to the resolutions of the Central Party, Government, and Military Affairs on improving administrative efficiency and the general review meeting of the "Administrative Two-Link System" to focus on responsibilities and crack down on concurrent jobs, the government issued an order to that effect. However, fearing that people would become lax over time and that there would still be instances of outwardly complying but inwardly disobeying, the Central Executive Committee sent a letter with the resolution passed by the Second Plenary Meeting of the Sixth Central Executive Committee on the personnel reform section (7): "One person, one position. Unless absolutely necessary, concurrent positions are not allowed." The Executive Yuan should reiterate the previous order, instructing the heads of all agencies to strictly comply without any favoritism. The order arrived in the city yesterday, and the Municipal Government issued a circular to all its subordinate agencies to strictly comply.

### Interpretation of "Civil Servants" in the Election Law

The Ministry of the Interior yesterday issued a circular to the provincial and municipal governments, stating: "Regarding how the scope of 'civil servants' mentioned in Article 2, Section 1 of the Provincial Council Election Law should be defined, there is no clear provision in the law. We have submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to forward it to the Judicial Yuan for unified interpretation. Now, we have received the Executive Yuan's instruction No. 8227, Jieshi, dated March 18 of this year, stating: 'Submitted and noted. The Judicial Yuan replied in letter No. 3088, Yuanjie, dated February 25, 35 of the Republic of China: "Civil servants with legally established titles in national government agencies, even if they exceed the quota, are still 'civil servants' as mentioned in Article 11, Section 1 of the Provincial Councilors Election Law. Employees of state-owned enterprises established by law, if they are subject to appointment, are also 'civil servants' as mentioned in the same section, even if the agency does not have organizational regulations. Those currently holding such positions should have their right to be elected suspended. Regular active-duty soldiers or police officers, even if they exceed the quota, are also subject to Section 2 of the same article," etc. We hereby instruct you to inform the Ministry of Judicial Administration and the provincial and municipal governments to inform their subordinates.' In addition to issuing instructions separately, we hereby request you to investigate and inform your subordinates."

### 22nd District Distributes Flour

### Assisting Production, Enriching People's Food Supply: Wheat and Salt Loans Established Simultaneously. Secretary-General Xu Personally Presides in Shanghai. 15 Billion Yuan for Each Initiative.

In order to cooperate with national policies, stabilize salt prices, and secure the livelihood of salt producers, the Four Joint Offices (四聯總處) have specially launched business loans, established a loan syndicate to handle various loans for production, transportation, and transport equipment. Furthermore, to increase production, enrich the food supply, and stabilize grain prices, wheat loans have also been launched, forming a wheat loan syndicate. Simultaneously, groups of salt and wheat loan review committees were established to be responsible for reviewing loan matters. The two committees held their establishment meetings simultaneously yesterday (29th) at 10:00 AM in the conference room of the Four Joint Offices' Shanghai Branch. Secretary-General Xu Boyuan (徐柏園) of the Four Joint Offices was dispatched to Shanghai to preside over the meetings. Committee members Huo Yamin (霍亞民), Wang Zishuang (王紫霜), Cai Gongchun (蔡公椿), Pan Jiufen (潘久芬), Zhu Tongjiu (朱通九), Xue Dijin (薛迪錦), Huang Yinpu (黄蔭普), Shen Jing (沈鏡), Chen Rujin (陳如金) of the Salt Affairs Administration, Wang Junliang (汪君良) of the Food Department, and guests Zhao Dihua (趙棣華), Bian Baimei (卞白眉), Lin Fengbao (林鳳苞), Shen Xirui (沈熙瑞), and more than twenty others attended. Secretary-General Xu chaired the meeting. Mr. Xu first explained the significance of the establishment and reported on the three major directives of the Chairman and Vice-Chairman Song of the Four Joint Offices: (1) The handling must be thorough and practical, suitable for the times, and genuinely effective; (2) The principles must be open, fair, and just; (3) The purpose is to benefit the country, the people, and ourselves. Mr. Xu elaborated on these three points and hoped that all members of the two committees would earnestly follow them. Subsequently, Chen Rujin, Huo Yamin, Lin Fengbao, Bian Baimei, Wang Junliang, Zhao Dihua, Shen Xirui, Pan Jiufen, and others expressed their opinions separately. Then, proposals were discussed and it was decided that on the 29th and 30th, review committee meetings would be held separately to decide on the methods for granting salt and wheat loans, following the principles instructed by the Board of Directors of the Four Joint Offices, and that the loan syndicate should expedite the granting of loans to avoid delays. Vice-Chairman Song has already appointed Huo Yamin, Chairman of the Loan Committee of the Four Joint Offices, to also serve as the Chairman of the Salt Loan Review Committee. Zhao Dihua, General Manager of the Bank of Communications, and Li Shuming, General Manager of the Farmers Bank, will serve concurrently as Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Wheat Loan Review Committee. According to Secretary-General Xu of the Four Joint Offices, the details of the handling of the two types of loans are as follows:

Salt Loans to be Piloted for Six Months

In May of this year, the Office received instructions from the Chairman and Vice-Chairman that salt loans should have a complete set of procedures. In compliance, the Salt Administration Bureau was requested to provide a complete set of procedures for overall planning. Later, the Salt Administration Bureau replied that the general situation in the country was not yet stable, and the conditions in various salt-producing areas were different. While the salt industry relied on financial adjustments, loans must ensure safety. It was proposed to start with the Sichuan salt-producing area and the Huai area (i.e., the Yangtze River basin), which had the widest sales area, the largest amount of funds used, and were relatively safe, and pilot the project for six months. At that time, the situation would be assessed and adjustments would be made. The proposed total loan amount was 49.4 billion yuan, divided into: (1) Production loans of 12.4 billion yuan; (2) Salt transportation loans of 31 billion yuan; (3) Transportation equipment loans of 6 billion yuan. The Board of Directors initially approved a loan amount of 45 billion yuan (temporarily removing 5 billion yuan from the original production loan for the Huaibei, Huainan, and Shandong areas). Various banks were to form a syndicate to invite commercial firms to participate. Subsequently, after repeated invitations to representatives from various banks and the Salt Administration Bureau to discuss the organizational regulations of the Joint Loan Review Committee and the organizational regulations of the ×× Area Salt Loan Syndicate, the 311th Board of Directors meeting on July 11th resolved to amend and approve them separately, and then sent letters to various banks and the Salt Administration Bureau to recommend representatives to jointly organize. Yesterday afternoon, the Salt Loan Review Committee convened its first meeting to study the loan policy and make specific decisions on the term, interest rate, target, and method. The main focus was on salt production and sales, and restrictive lending for financing purposes was implemented. The Salt Administration Bureau was responsible for preliminary review, followed by a review by the syndicate, and a post-event audit to ensure thoroughness, improve the quality of salt, reduce the burden on salt producers, and increase national treasury revenue. Finally, it was also planned to establish syndicates in Chongqing and Hankou (named the Sichuan-Kang District Salt Syndicate, with a total amount of 17.2 billion yuan).

Wheat Loans Total 30 Billion

Considering that the new wheat of this year has already entered the market, in order to cooperate with the government's food policy, assist various flour mills in purchasing raw materials in a timely manner, actively produce, so as to enrich the food supply and stabilize grain prices, the Four Joint Offices designated the Bank of Communications and the Farmers Bank to invite various banks and relevant competent authorities, as well as representatives from the Flour Industry Association, to discuss repeatedly, first to launch loans to various factories in the Fourth District to assist in the purchase of wheat, and with reference to the Salt Affairs General Loan case, proposed the method of organizing a syndicate, and jointly submitted it to the 311th Board of Directors meeting on July 11 for approval to handle wheat loans of 30 billion yuan, and approved the organizational regulations of the Wheat Loan Review Committee and the Wheat Loan Syndicate, and distributed them to various banks and relevant agencies to recommend representatives to jointly organize.

The above two matters are of great importance to the national economy and people's livelihood, maintaining producers on the one hand and consumers on the other. In particular, if the wheat loans are handled properly, the planned allocation of food will be of great help to the food public sales system.

### Gold Deposits: Starting Next Week, Redeemable in Shanghai, Choice of Cash or Gold

During the Anti-Japanese War, in order to prevent inflation and stabilize prices, the government, through the Central Bank, launched a method of gold deposits converted from legal tender, implemented by various banks in the rear. Purchasers were enthusiastic. It is now reliably learned that in order to facilitate the accounts of depositors who purchased this gold deposit certificate, starting next week, all can be redeemed in Shanghai's various banks by means of collection, whether in national currency or gold, according to the convenience of the customer.

### Gold and Currency Both Fall

Yesterday, due to the selling pressure from US dollar side and the oppression of sources, the Gold Note market was lifeless. The opening price had already retreated to 1.915 million, and this price was still surrounded by sellers. After the opening, it continued to fall to around 1.895 million. After 10 o'clock, the central government allocated 77 registered items at a price of 1.895 million. After that, it became even more mediocre, struggling between 1.89 million and 1.9 million. It was not until near noon that it crossed the 1.9 million mark. In the afternoon, it initially stabilized and then rebounded, first seeing a volume of 1.91 million, but finally retreated to around 1.895 million. As a result, it fell another 30,000 compared to last Saturday. Decorated gold was 10,003,000, silver was flat, silver dollars fell slightly, and the interest rate for informal discounts was still between 10% and 15%.

There were actual US dollars flowing out of the foreign currency market, and the market was relatively inferior in the middle. However, there was a lot of activity among those who exchanged gold for currency. After falling, it was easy to rebound. Yesterday, the opening price was 2,510 yuan with sellers, and supplies from Hong Kong soon fell to 2,470 yuan, and only then did speculative buying maintain it. At noon, it rose slightly and hovered around 2,500 yuan. In the afternoon, it was initially stable and then weakened, retreating from around 2,510 yuan to within 2,500 yuan. As a result, it fell 40 yuan compared to last Saturday. The buying and selling price of Hong Kong dollars was slightly widened, and as a result, it rose slightly by 2 yuan. The US dollar exchange rate, British exchange rate, rupee, and Hong Kong telegram were all the same as last Saturday.

Unified Class C Bonds Fall Slightly

The public bond market was stable, and trading was slightly active. The opening price fell slightly, and it was not until near noon that it rose slightly. The opening price of Unified Class C bonds was around 700 yuan, and only then did it maintain. At noon, it rose to 750 yuan and hovered. As a result, it fell slightly by 20 yuan compared to last Saturday. Other bonds did not fare much better or worse.

### Chinese Stocks Hover, Foreign Stocks Sluggish

The situation of Chinese stocks was erratic. Powerful players first advanced and then retreated. After rising near noon, they retreated slightly. The situation in the middle was slightly tortuous, first low and then high. Yong Yarn (永紗) had a low price of 655 yuan, Mayar (美亞) 4,250 yuan, King Fook (景福) 245 yuan, New Kwong (新光) 238 yuan, and Kan Hing (勤興) 175 yuan. Near noon, when they were the most popular, Yong Yarn was 690 yuan, Mayar 4,470 yuan, King Fook 260 yuan, New Kwong 255 yuan, and Kan Hing 190 yuan. When closing near noon, the strong faction sold off a little, and they all suddenly fell. As a result, the five popular stocks of Yong Yarn, Mayar, King Fook, New Kwong, and Kan Hing were similar to last Saturday. The smaller and medium-sized stocks and veteran stocks had little change. Sun Hing (信和) opened as a new stock, which was similar to before the stock swap.

Foreign stocks were still not vigorous. At the opening, they were slightly stable. Ewo Yarns (怡紗) were bought at 8,900 yuan, and British American Tobacco (英聯) at 9,000 yuan also had buyers, but they still felt soft when closing. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Jardine Matheson (會德豐), Ewo Yarns, and British American Tobacco were flat, while those that were less popular fell slightly by about 5%. There were even fewer transactions, and it was extremely sluggish.

### Yarn Market Remains Weak, Fabric Transactions Scarce

Yesterday, the fatigue of the yarn market had not been eliminated. Although the simultaneous transactions of 20-count Double Horse (雙馬) from the same industry raised the price by 20,000, actual sales were sluggish, and few customers made any moves. Smaller and medium-sized yarns were sold at lower prices, and they were particularly controlled by the owner, and the price fell by 10,000-20,000. Fine yarns also lacked vigor. At noon, Textile Construction (紡建) opened the yarn list as usual. There were no allotments for 42-count yarn. Only Li Ma (立馬) and Yang (陽) brands were available for 20-count yarn, and the amount was still very limited.

Yesterday, the spot cotton market was flat and tired, and transactions were very rare. The majority of manufacturers, in view of the recent sharp decline in US cotton, still held a wait-and-see attitude. Only Hung Chang (鴻章) and Nantong Dasheng Yarn Factory (南通大生紗廠) made slight purchases, 300-400 bales of ordinary middling cotton, and 300-400 bales of Uruguayan cotton for in-house trading.

Actual sales of fabric were sluggish, and people's minds were tending downwards. Leading brands of drill (嘰) fell by 250-500 yuan in the afternoon, and there were very few spot transactions.

### French Vietnam Freezes Legal Tender Deposits, Restrictions on Carrying and Remitting Money

The spokesman of the French Commissioner's Office in North Vietnam announced on the 27th that any person of any nationality residing in Vietnam is limited to carrying 1,000 Vietnamese dong per person. Overseas Chinese residing in Vietnam who wish to remit money back to the country for family use are limited to 5,000 Vietnamese dong per household per month and must be accepted by the Banque de l'Indochine and the Sino-French Bank. All commercial remittances are limited to 2,500 Vietnamese dong, also limited to the above two banks. According to a reporter from the Central News Agency, all national currency deposits of overseas Chinese in the Chinese Bank of Communications in Hanoi and Haiphong have been frozen at the request of the authorities and are not allowed to be withdrawn, but they are still allowed to remit these frozen national currency deposits back to the country. The purpose of this measure is to reduce the circulation of national currency in Vietnam in order to stabilize the value of Vietnamese currency. The total amount of frozen national currency is about 2 billion yuan.

### Grain Price Review Slightly Reduced, Vegetable Oil Factories Continue to Sell

The Social Bureau's Grain Review Committee convened its 11th par price review meeting yesterday afternoon as usual. Attending were Ji Mingzhai (吉明齋), head of the Grain Section of the Social Bureau, Zhao Gongran (趙公然), representative of the Provisional Senate, and grain merchants Zhang Xichao (張錫潮), Cai Shengming (蔡聲明), Wang Bingkun (王炳坤), Zhao Xingjie (趙行潔), and Yin Fuxiang (印福祥). After discussion, (1) those maintaining the original price were: white japonica rice 64,000 yuan, thin indica rice 64,000 yuan, and sheep indica rice 63,000 yuan; (2) those re-examined were: port indica rice 56,000 yuan (originally 58,000 yuan), door sales 61,000 yuan, milled currency 51,000 yuan (originally 53,000 yuan), door sales 56,000 yuan, white indica rice 46,000 yuan (originally 50,000 yuan), door sales 50,500 yuan. Although the prices set this time are lower than the last time, they are still higher than the market prices. The reason is to encourage rice merchants to purchase and transport and increase rice reserves. All will be offered on the market at the stated prices today. And because the grain market is becoming more and more regular, the Social Bureau has slightly changed the review date, every Wednesday and Friday, as the par price review day.

Over 10,000 piculs arrived in the north and south markets yesterday. Digestion of white japonica rice was sporadic. The market was strong and secondary rice was tired. The supply of indica rice exceeded demand, and it was extremely sluggish. There was also a situation of raising prices and killing secondary goods. White yuan shops selected high-quality goods, which was still active. Secondary goods were also rarely asked about. There were rumors in the flour market that the ban would be lifted, and people's hearts were flourishing. Prices rose by 500-600 yuan. Due to the shortage of boat spaces, small wheat bulk cargoes outside the gang had no intention of buying, and transactions were rare and the market was particularly tired. Hulls were rarely seen rising. The factory's wheat also rose by 600-700 yuan along with the flour price. New soybeans continued to arrive, and the market situation was flat. The oil market did not open, and external trading of raw oil shouted up to 88,000 to 89,000 yuan, and soybean oil was 84,000 yuan. It is learned that the Ministry of Economic Affairs' China Vegetable Oil Factory has ample reserves, so it decided to stabilize oil prices as much as possible. Yesterday, the factory still sold 700 barrels of raw rapeseed oil at a price of 68,000 yuan per load, which was 6,000 yuan cheaper per load than the market price, and it will continue to be sold today.

### Tea Market is Very Active in Domestic Sales

Of the new goods of Sian (泗安) Chouchun (抽珍), only 24 boxes have been taken up by the Indian merchant Yulong Yanghang (裕隆洋行), at a price of 200,500 yuan per load, sold by the Xinhua Tea Factory (新華茶廠). In addition, the British merchant Harmony Yanghang (協和洋行) took in 72 boxes of aged Keemun (祁門), at a price of 77,000 yuan per load. As for domestic sales, it is still very active. Wang Yutai (汪裕泰) handled 200 boxes of aged Keemun, and Wuyuan (婺源) took 404 baskets of aged fried green tea at the same time. The Shandong gang picked up 50 baskets of Zhongzhu Jasmine (中珠蘭). Other old Keemun, Taiwan black tea, Yushan new fried green, new Longjing, etc., are all being taken up by Dadao shops and customers, and the quotations of each stall are all up.

### Taiwan has 210,000 Tons of Stored Sugar, Transportation Difficulties Cause Great Losses to the Company

The biggest difficulty currently facing the Taiwan Sugar Corporation is transportation blockage. Tseng Chao-cheng (曾昭承), deputy director of the Taiwan Provincial Sugar Production Takeover Committee, told reporters yesterday, "10,000 tons of sugar are currently stored in Keelung Port and cannot be transported for export. The warehouses are small and the warehouse rents are high, causing considerable losses to the company." Taiwan Sugar relies entirely on the ships of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (招商局) to transport to Shanghai. The reporter then interviewed Chen Dekun (陳德坤), manager of the Shanghai China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. He said: In the past two weeks, ships sailing from Shanghai to Taiwan totaled 4,000 tons, all for other uses. There will be no ships transporting sugar for export in the coming week. Taiwan Sugar Corporation received 150,000 tons of sugar stored by the Japanese, and has produced 86,000 tons since the takeover. However, Taiwan Sugar only first transported sugar for export in May of this year. To date, the total amount of sugar transported to Shanghai is 19,200 tons. At present, there are still 216,800 tons of sugar stored in Taiwan Province. Tseng Chao-cheng said: The inability to transport the stored sugar has caused the Taiwan Sugar Corporation's capital turnover to be inflexible. At present, the company relies on loans from the Taiwan Bank to maintain its business. He believes that if the transportation problem is solved, the monthly transportation volume can exceed the 10,000 tons hoped for by the Executive Yuan.

### Tenth Sugar Falls Slightly

Yesterday, the sugar market saw a slight decline due to rumors that Chaoqing (潮靑) was being loaded again. Goods labeled with 10th grade from Shantou gangs opened at 90,500 yuan to 90,000 yuan, Huanggangqing (黃崗靑) at 88,000 yuan, a decrease of 1,000-2,000 yuan, and Zusanjians (足三尖) at 143,000 yuan, with a hundred-odd bales traded. Xinghua gangs opened with Shanggong Fenbai (上貢粉白) at 132,000 yuan to 130,000 yuan to 127,800 yuan, secondary goods at 114,000-5,000 yuan, and Xinghua red at 114,000-5,000 yuan to 112,000-3,000 yuan, for a total of over a hundred baskets.

### Prioritize Rear Area Industries: Auctioning Enemy and Puppet Factories, 30% Discount, Installment Payments

The Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau (敵偽產業處理局), after receiving enemy and puppet factories, in addition to the 68 that have already been auctioned off, will continue to auction off the rest. It is possible to allocate dozens of factories to be sold to rear area industrialists at 70% of the original estimated price, and installment payments are allowed to show preferential treatment. According to the installment payment method, the first installment is to pay one-third of the total amount, and the second installment is to be paid six months later, with the total amount to be paid off within one year. As for the rear area industrialists' firm request to undertake enemy and puppet factories unconditionally, it is feared that it will be difficult to handle. The list of meritorious rear area industrialists is currently being discussed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and relevant parties.

### Minsheng Ship Sails from Shanghai to Chongqing Carrying Large Quantities of Cotton Yarn and Cloth

[Reported by this newspaper] The Minsheng Company's Minben ship (民本輪), after repairs, has resumed sailing. It is scheduled to sail directly from Shanghai to Chongqing tomorrow morning. There are not many passengers, but a large amount of commercial goods, including more than 500 pieces of cotton yarn and cotton cloth, and many hardware and sundries, are berthed at Wharf 12 on the Bund. Loading was carried out day and night yesterday, and the ship will weigh anchor this morning ahead of schedule.

There are no goods in Tianjin.

### Yangquan Coal Loosens

Since the arrival of large quantities of Yangquan lump coal via the Zhonglian ship (中連輪), the white coal market has loosened, and some peers have taken advantage of the high prices to pre-sell futures, so the price of Yangquan lump coal has fallen below the 400,000 mark, and there are sellers at 390,000 yuan. High-grade bituminous coal lump is being purchased by all parties, and the market is short of goods, and the trend is quite strong, and the market price continues to rise. The sales of the white coal layer is active, while the sales of the bituminous coal layer is still similar to the previous one, the former selling actively and the latter selling slowly. The sales of firewood and charcoal has been slightly affected since the price increase.

### Lumber Weak

Yesterday, the lumber market was slightly weak due to the continued arrival of foreign pine. The price of fir wood was still stable. Currently, the market price of Lauan is still firm due to the dwindling inventory, and the rest are in a weak state.

### Mexican Gold Arrives in Hong Kong in Large Quantities

May Flow Back into China

[United Press Hong Kong, 28th] A large amount of gold flowed into Hong Kong from Mexico last week, causing fierce fluctuations in the black market for gold, but the general trend is downward, because of the insecurity of Chinese currency and the scarcity of US dollar exchange, so gold must be imported. Most of the gold will be shipped to mainland China, but Hong Kong authorities prohibit the export of gold. Employees of various foreign banks told United Press reporters that the price of Mexican gold is 36 US dollars per ounce, and the price in Hong Kong is 90 US dollars. At the beginning of last week, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate was 430 yuan in legal tender, and at the weekend it had fallen to 358 yuan in legal tender, because of rumors that many foreign banks would sell 40-day futures at prices lower than the black market. As a result, it fell again to 368 yuan in legal tender at yesterday's closing.

### The Tide of Guangling in July

— This newspaper's Sixth of the Month Yangzhou Dispatch, Special Correspondent Wang Gonghan

It is very obvious that for the past ten days or so, due to reports in newspapers across Nanjing and Shanghai, and indeed due to the situation in northern Jiangsu, there has been conflict everywhere. It is said that those living away from their hometowns here are genuinely and suddenly filled with worries!

Conflict Everywhere, Travelers Hesitate

In reality, the situation encountered in Yangzhou for the past ten days or so is not as entirely serious as some newspapers have reported or as those concerned have overly worried. However, those living away from their hometowns here often write home, urging their families to leave Yangzhou as soon as possible, or they disregard the hardship of traveling in the hot weather and make a special trip back to Yangzhou to check on things, expressing their so-called "lack of peace of mind." On the other hand, there are also merchants from Yangzhou who are temporarily traveling outside the city. In the past few days, rumors spread that they were so frightened by the "atmosphere" that they dared not rashly return to their hometowns, hesitating in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Zhenjiang. I, as the reporter, learned of this situation in the past few days from conversations with two relatives and friends who had already returned to Yangzhou. And one can imagine that when the situation here was indeed more tense for those few days, there must have been many people who considered Yangzhou to be "in imminent danger."

All Parties Calmly and Composedly Cope

Now, allow me, the reporter, "being here in person," to tell you: It is indeed a fact that the Communist army has plans to attack Yangzhou City. However, when the Communist army carried out "destroying the Yangzhou-Taizhou highway," "attacking the Fairy Maiden Temple," and "raiding the White Pagoda River," the general state of society here did not show any panic. On the contrary, the official parties like the party, government, military, and police, were all very calm in all aspects and radiated a spirit of composed response. The general public was also the same. Although they may have had "plans for the worst-case scenario," they never experienced panic. There are reasons for this: first, people somewhat understand that the strength of the garrisoned troops is such that they can ensure the security of Yangzhou; second, people believe that the garrisoned troops would never let Yangzhou fall into the hands of the Communist army; third, people understand that in terms of terrain, Yangzhou is only separated from Zhenjiang by a river, with the "Yangzhou Embankment Highway," which is only about thirty miles long, and this is a good military supply line. Moreover, according to what I know, the garrisoned troops themselves have full confidence in ensuring the security of Yangzhou.

The Communist Army Is Less Than Ten Miles Away

On the afternoon of the 21st, I met with Director Yan of the Political Department of the garrisoned troops here, and he said: "Even if the Communist army comes with a hundred thousand people to attack Yangzhou, we won't buy it!" I believe that his words are not meaningless bravado, because I, although untalented, have had more than four years of military experience in "defending against the enemy and preventing traitors." Based on my observation, if we compare the "combat strength" (including weapons and equipment, and combat personnel's experience in large-scale battles, etc.) of the Communist army with the "combat strength" (same content as above) of the National army, the National army indeed has the superior condition of being able to defeat the Communist army's majority with a minority, and ultimately has the confidence to completely defeat the Communist army. As for the situation in Yangzhou, Director Yan analyzed it quite clearly: "In the northwestern suburbs of Yangzhou, the Communist army's closest area of activity, such as Yangjia Temple and Ganquan Mountain, is less than ten miles away from Yangzhou City, and its strength, although not very great, is three regiments. But why has it never dared to step beyond the thunder pool again? Because by doing that, it knows it won't gain anything good; absolutely nothing good! ... In a word: our rigorous and solid deployment prevents it from invading!"

The County Magistrate's Inspection Brings Peace of Mind

On the side of the county government, County Magistrate Zhang inspected Yiling Town, the center point of the Yangzhou-Taizhou highway, on the 20th (in the eastern countryside of Yangzhou). If the county magistrate can run dozens of miles out of the urban area, why should the people in the urban area be uneasy? The "Second Plenary Session of the Provisional Council of Jiangdu County" started booming again in the "Zhongshan Memorial Hall" in the north of the city yesterday (the 25th). In addition to the heads of various agencies in Yangzhou County, Ling Shaozu, a provincial committee member, also came from Zhenjiang to Yangzhou to participate. This further diluted the atmosphere of the war that Yangzhou had faced a few days ago. The actions of this group of "social elites" in the "Provisional Council" have invisibly provided considerable spiritual support to the people.

As Solid as a Fortress, As Stable as a Rock

I heard that the situation in Zhenjiang, on the contrary, does not seem as calm as Yangzhou. This newspaper's special correspondent Hang Zhou, who came to Yangzhou City from Shanghai via Zhenjiang a few days ago, saw the market here: teahouses full of customers, shops on the street doing business as usual, and he said that to the reporter. The movement of Zhenjiang should depend on Yangzhou. Therefore, I mentioned one thing to Hang: When the situation in Taixing City was once unclear, several banks here inevitably felt a little panicked and urgently transported huge sums of money from their vaults to Zhenjiang, and some employees also sent their families to Zhenjiang. At that time, it had aroused the attention and disturbance of the people in Yangzhou City, but those few banks immediately received criticism from the people. Therefore, the "Jiangdu Daily" here on the 21st had a record of a conversation with Jiang Renyu, manager of the Yangzhou branch of the Central Bank, saying that "no matter how the environment changes in the future, the Central Bank will act in unison with the military and political authorities and will never evacuate on its own."

In short, regarding the security here, if we don't say "as solid as a fortress," we can also say "as stable as a rock."

The Epidemic of Cholera Causes Panic

However, in addition to the military situation being able to stabilize people's hearts, there are two things in Yangzhou that are extremely difficult to reassure people about. One thing is the epidemic of cholera. According to what I learned yesterday from meeting with Xu Ruihe, the head of the "Provincial Yangzhou Hospital," and Ye Shicheng, the head of the "Private Yangzhou Concord Hospital," Yangzhou has now become an area where cholera is spreading rapidly, with several people dying from this terrible disease every day. In daily life, I see that when people talk about this disease, they often "turn pale at the mention of the tiger." Also, at the banquet for reporters at the "Provisional Council" on the 24th, perhaps because of the deep understanding of the situation of the cholera epidemic, there was a phenomenon of not daring to eat such "cold dishes" and being afraid to touch dishes that easily attract flies, with a great sense of panic. As a result, a certain brother, a veteran reporter, was able to eat heartily and specially!

The Times Affect Commercial Decline

Another thing is the commercial depression. Yangzhou's commerce has been affected by the situation, and from last winter to this summer, it has been declining and depressed. The main phenomenon is that old customers from the surrounding villages and towns are rarely seen coming into the city to buy things. For example, the "Viewing Incense Market," which is usually bustling for a season, has quietly passed this year without a sound. Silk shops, southern goods stores... all have the sad scene of "mice running on the counter," as people say. Therefore, recently, many shops have closed. One situation is that expenses are large and income is small, and there is no way to maintain it any longer. The tax authorities continue to collect business taxes from the remaining shops that are still struggling to maintain their appearance but are actually on the verge of death. Therefore, on this day of the 21st, an organization called "Yangzhou Merchants' Welfare Mutual Aid Society" was created here, with the reason and hardship of "this county suffering severely during the enemy-puppet period, the period of stable order after victory being the latest, and now entering the military period, all industries are depressed..." This "Mutual Aid Society," representing all merchants and people of Yangzhou, will go to the province to request that the authorities exempt the business tax from November 34th to January 35th, and from May, June, and July of this year. They are prepared to pay the business tax for February, March, April of this year, but they request that the funds the government borrowed from Yangzhou merchants in the past be returned. I have a few opinions on this matter: I hope that the government, following the virtuous policy of exempting land taxes, can show more consideration for Yangzhou's commerce, which has suffered disasters repeatedly! Otherwise, according to my understanding, the shops here will likely close down completely. If that happens, it will greatly affect the security of Yangzhou and the stability of the people's hearts.

### Peaceful Xi'an

— This newspaper's Twenty-Fifth of the Month Xi'an Dispatch, Special Correspondent Li Chi

The flames of war in the Central Plains finally spread to the borders of Shaanxi on the 20th of this month. Without a doubt, this news is receiving close attention from all parties here. The airplanes flying back and forth over the southeastern corner of the clear sky seem to be more frequent than usual. The blue sky, which has been silent for almost a year, seems to be agitated again.

Li Xiannian's communist forces, between southern Henan and northern Hubei, have been clearly moving westward in the past month and a half. The boundary lines between the provincial governments of Henan, Hubei, and Shaanxi are artificially political divisions. There are no high mountains or great rivers as natural divisions. Within Shaanxi, the Qinling Mountains (namely Zhongnan Mountain) and the Funiu Mountains in Henan, or rather, the Han River Valley in southern Shaanxi and northern Hubei, is a continuous low-lying area connecting the three provinces. When observing news on this front, this point should be noted. However, no matter what, from the perspective of people living in Shaanxi, the sound of gunfire within the province always feels like a direct injury, which is a common sentiment of people who love their homeland. What the common people pray for day and night is a peaceful territory and a prosperous populace!

Traveling southeast from Xi'an along the highway, crossing the Qinling Mountains, including the famous "Snow blocks the Lan Pass, horses cannot advance" Lan Pass, one reaches Shang County, Longjuzhai, and Shangnan, and then enters Henan at Jingziguan and Zhechuan, and further south, one reaches Laohekou in Hubei. This is an old road and highway connecting the three provinces of Shaanxi, Henan, and Hubei. In recent days, the place names along the southern section of the route have successively appeared in official announcements in the telegraph. The westernmost point of Li Xiannian's forces, according to official reports, is near Longjuzhai. Measuring the straight-line distance on the map, it is approximately two hundred li southeast of Xi'an. However, there is the high and dangerous Qinling Mountains separating them, like a row of barriers. Therefore, this distance is not very meaningful. Xi'an is currently very stable, and the market situation is as usual.

The "Military Mediation Department" has dispatched the 32nd Executive Group, consisting of six people, to mediate and handle the military affairs in this area. They departed from Laohekou and arrived in Longjuzhai on the 20th. The list includes the government representatives Major General Wang Kaiting and Lieutenant Colonel Shi Xizhi, the communist representatives Lieutenant Colonel Ren Shicun and Major Shi Gu, and the American representatives Lieutenant Colonel Bai Luosuo and Captain He Lumai. Lieutenant Colonel Bai fell ill on the way and should have rested, but due to his strong sense of responsibility, he persevered. The group has invited Li Xiannian himself or sent a representative to Longjuzhai for consultation. The group of six is scheduled to take the road through Shang County to Xi'an on the 24th, and the officials here have prepared a welcome. "Turn hostility into friendship," that is what the common people are praying for.

Shang County, Longjuzhai, and Shangnan belong to the Fourth Administrative Commissioner District of this province. In this district, near the mountainous areas in southern (north of Longjuzhai) and southern slope (south of Longjuzhai) and Shang County, there has been news in the past ten days that security is lacking, with large gangs and some scattered bandits appearing. They are well-equipped, and Chen Zhuokan, the commissioner and commander-in-chief of the Fourth District, is setting a deadline for clearing them. Whether this group of people is purely brigands or rebels, and whether they have any connection with Li Xiannian's forces, is worth pondering. Exploring from the perspectives of time and location, it seems quite difficult to be such a "coincidence."

In the past, a lot of goods were transported into Shaanxi via this highway. But since the Longhai Railway became smooth, the amount of goods transported via this highway has been decreasing as the railway freight rates are cheaper than the highway freight rates. Therefore, although there is gunfire in the southeastern corner of Shaanxi, there are no signs of direct impact on the market. Whether in finance or prices, everything remains stable, which is an indicator of the stability of people's hearts.

The past few days have been relatively sultry, perhaps the hottest days of this summer. Yesterday afternoon, a sudden rainstorm with thunder and lightning damaged many electric poles and trees. After about eighty or ninety minutes of violence, the sky cleared, and the evening sun was still so bright. I couldn't help but think of Beethoven's "Pastoral Symphony" last two movements: the sound of the flute is clearer after the rumble of thunder, and the common people thank God for regaining peace.

### Responding to Readers, Medicine and Health

(1) Shi Weiying asks (1) The Student Economic Canteen organized by the Shanghai Student Relief Committee provides two meals a day, each meal consisting of a piece of bread, a little jam, and a glass of milk made from milk powder. Is this sufficient for the daily nutritional needs of an adult? What kind of vitamins is this meal lacking? What kind of food should be added? (2) What is the best way to treat anemia quickly? (3) After suffering from scabies, I mistakenly applied carbolic acid solution, resulting in black scars that have not disappeared for a long time. What can I do to remove the black scars?

[Answer by Dr. Yu Xin'en, MD] (1) An adult needs an average of about 2,400 calories per month from food. According to your description, it is far from this standard. An adult should consume 10 to 15 taels of grains, 1 catty of vegetables, including root vegetables for about a quarter, 3 to 6 taels of beans, 2 to 3 taels of animal and vegetable oil, and it would be even better to have 2 to 3 taels of fish and meat. (2) For anemia, eat more liver. (3) Wait for it to fade on its own. (2) Zhou Liwo asks: My feet are swollen in hot weather, and the swelling moves upward. There is no pain, but sometimes I feel numb. When I press with my finger, there is a dent that takes a long time to disappear. The swelling subsides slightly in the morning, and the swelling is severe in the autumn. What is this disease? What medicine can cure it?

[Answer by Dr. Yu Xin'en, MD] This is beriberi. Eat more beans. You can also inject vitamin B1.

(3) Yu Ziying asks: I am over fifty years old. I have suffered from headaches on the left side of my head since I was in my twenties. I have consulted at Renji, Guangren and other hospitals and prescribed light red medicine, which comes and goes. It often occurs when I am in a bad mood, or angry, or after reading a lot of books and writing a lot of articles. It has been over twenty years. In the past ten years, I have often taken headache powder to relieve the pain, but it still happens once or twice a month. I would be very grateful if you could tell me how to cure it.

[Answer by Dr. Yu Xin'en, MD] The disease is called migraine, which is related to abnormal personality. You should be less angry and depressed. There is no cure.

### A Lung Disease Patient Requests Drugstores to Reduce Fees

Singing praises to the benevolent act of Xinfu Pharmacy

Dear Editor: I read in your column that Xinfu Chinese Pharmacy is offering 10,000 free prescriptions to sick families. Their enthusiasm for helping the poor is admirable. I have suffered from lung disease for many years and have spent a great deal of money on medicine and injections. Since your newspaper reprinted the proven prescription for lung disease from Shaanxi, I bought and took it. I have taken over seventy doses, and the situation is still good. I can now work as usual. During this period, I have also asked various Chinese pharmacies to reduce their prices, because it is a commonly used prescription, and they should consider the patients, but I have not been able to get what I wanted. Now Xinfu Pharmacy is considerate of the poor and sick and is giving away 10,000 doses. If other Chinese pharmacies follow suit and consider the cost, reducing or waiving fees, the benefits to the poor and sick will be significant. Please publish this letter in your newspaper so that it can be a call to those with lung disease who cannot afford treatment. I am deeply grateful. Sincerely, Yan Renfu

### Soil Wells and Stinking Ponds Should Be Filled Within a Time Limit

So that germs have nowhere to parasitize

Dear Editor: The summer is hot, and the scorching sun is rampant. Epidemics and typhoid fever are bound to occur at any time. However, timely prevention is the best policy. The soil wells in the city's alleys and the stinking rivers and ponds in the suburbs are the source of germs. If you want to prevent epidemics, the fundamental plan is to fill them within a time limit. I implore your newspaper to publish a grand theory and urge the municipal authorities to pay close attention to it, which will benefit the world. Sincerely, Sun Yibin

### Explanation of Defatted Milk Powder

Students of all schools must pay attention

To whom it may concern: I recently read in your column on the 14th of this month the reply from the Relief Administration explaining the quality of milk powder, which stated that "this milk powder is not suitable for direct consumption and must be prepared. For methods, please refer to the instructions for defatted milk powder issued by this office." When the Relief Administration distributed the powder, it did not attach the "Instructions for Defatted Powder" to be posted to students, and the newspapers did not have instructions on how to drink it, so most students did not understand it and still prepared it according to the method for whole milk powder. I hope your column can find a way to publicize the method of consumption, which I would be very grateful for. Sincerely, Liu Jiancheng, Social Service Department, Shen Bao Editorial Department

[Appendix] Instructions for the defatted milk powder distributed by the Shanghai Branch of the Relief Administration of the Relief Administration: (1) Nutritional value: Defatted milk powder is made by removing the cream and water from milk. Two taels of milk powder can make sixteen taels (two measuring cups) or one pint of milk, which can provide one-fifth of the daily caloric needs of a five-year-old child, one-half of the required protein, two times the required calcium, one-quarter of the required vitamin B1, and the required amount of lactofen.

### The Twists and Turns of the Ever-Changing European Peace Conference

— Our Newspaper Archives

The European Peace Conference, long awaited by everyone, opened in Paris yesterday. The convening of the conference and the signing of the treaties are, on the one hand, a settlement of the war, and on the other hand, a foundation for future peace. Due to the vast scope of this Second World War and the complexity of post-war problems, the conference is divided into three parts: one for the five countries of Italy, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Finland; one for Germany; and one for Japan. This conference is the prelude to the peace conference, and the main issue is only to discuss the peace treaties with the five countries of Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland, but it can also be said to be paving the way for future peace treaties with Germany and Japan. We see that the convening of this conference has gone through many twists and turns beforehand, showing how difficult it is to seek lasting peace.

The collapse of Germany and the surrender of Japan ended the conflict of artillery fire on the battlefield and shifted it to negotiations between envoys. In the Potsdam Conference, there was a resolution to establish a meeting of the five foreign ministers to discuss post-war peace treaties. However, the Five Foreign Ministers' Conference of China, the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France in London in August 1945 ended in discord after twenty days of effort. In December, the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union met again in Moscow, attempting to break the deadlock, and decided that only member states that had signed the surrender document could participate in drafting the peace treaties with the five countries, that is, the peace treaty with Italy would be drafted by Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France; the peace treaties with Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary would be drafted by Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union; and the peace treaty with Finland would be drafted by Britain and the Soviet Union. Once the draft treaties were prepared, a peace conference would be held by the five member states participating in the Foreign Ministers' Conference and the sixteen countries in the United Nations that had made actual military contributions in resisting European enemy countries for final discussion. The conference was scheduled to be held on May 1 this year.

According to the decision of the Moscow Conference, representatives of the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France were ordered to draft peace treaties with the five countries separately in London. The Four Foreign Ministers' Conference was then held in Paris on April 25.

The Paris Four Foreign Ministers' Conference opened on April 25 and adjourned on May 15. After more than twenty days of discussion, although some minor issues had been agreed upon, many major issues remained unresolved and deadlocked.

(1) The Trieste Issue: The Soviet Union proposed that the Istrian Peninsula should be划歸 Yugoslavia. The United States advocated that Trieste should belong to Italy. France proposed a compromise solution of international co-management. Britain and the United States had agreed, but the Soviet Union insisted on not yielding, resulting in a pending issue.

(2) The Dodecanese Islands Issue: Britain agreed to return the islands to Greece, but the Soviet Union believed that this was one of Italy's colonies and should be discussed together with the Italian colonies.

(3) The Italian Border Issue: France and Austria both had disputes with Italy over territory. Part of Upper Adige had been decided to be retained by Italy. As for the areas of Tende and Briga requested by France, a decision would be made after a fact-finding mission.

(4) The Italian Colonial Issue: The Soviet Union requested sole trusteeship of Tripoli, while Britain advocated complete independence. France proposed that it should still be entrusted to Italy under the name of the United Nations. The United States also suggested adopting an international trusteeship system. Subsequently, the United States and the Soviet Union also agreed to France's proposal, but Britain insisted on using trusteeship of Cyrenaica as an exchange condition, which led to a deadlock.

(5) The Italian Reparations Issue: The Soviet Union demanded that Italy pay reparations of 300 million US dollars to the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, Greece, and Albania. Britain and the United States both believed that this would hinder Italy's recovery. As a result, the United States proposed that only three-quarters of the 100 million US dollars under the Soviet Union's name should be paid. However, the Soviet Union refused to accept.

(6) The Danube Navigation Issue: The United States requested the opening of the Danube, and Britain suggested international co-management, but the Soviet Union believed that all countries along the Danube had the necessity to participate in the discussion, so it refused to negotiate.

Since these many important issues could not be resolved, a layer of gray smoke shrouded European peace. The conference was originally scheduled to be convened on June 15, but the Soviet Union insisted that it could not be convened before the drafting of the peace treaties with the five countries was resolved. As a result, the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference decided to postpone it and reconvene one month later. In a dark situation, this revealed a glimmer of light.

After a month's adjournment, the four foreign ministers met again in Paris on June 15. This meeting was the key to maintaining European peace, and all countries attached great importance to it. However, the attitudes of Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union had not changed. In his broadcast speech after the meeting, Byrnes emphasized the firm policy of the United States, but Molotov said that the policy adopted by Britain and the United States was how to deal with the Soviet Union, not to maintain world peace. Many people were therefore worried about the future of the Foreign Ministers' Conference.

(1) Regarding the Trieste dispute, the Soviet Union still supported Yugoslavia's demands. Italy's attitude was more moderate, willing to accept international mediation to resolve it in a fair and reasonable manner, but believed that Wilson's method was generally reasonable, that is, to leave Trieste to Italy. Subsequently, the Soviet Union agreed to the plan for the internationalization of Trieste proposed by French Foreign Minister Bidault, but the designated area was pitifully small and surrounded by Yugoslavia, so Britain and the United States could not agree. Bidault then proposed a compromise solution, dividing it according to the border drawn by France, with the east belonging to Yugoslavia and the west belonging to Italy, while expanding the internationalized area of Trieste. The Trieste issue was then reluctantly resolved.

(2) Regarding Italy's reparations, the United States had agreed to the Soviet Union's demand for 100 million US dollars in reparations, but offset it with two of Italy's luxurious cruise ships, so as to avoid hindering Italy's livelihood. At this point, the Soviet Union slightly conceded, expressing its willingness to accept the US proposal. As for the 200 million US dollars demanded for reparations to Greece, Yugoslavia, and Albania, it was submitted to the peace conference for discussion.

(3) Regarding Italy's colonies, the Soviet Union, in order to extend its influence in the Mediterranean, requested sole trusteeship of Tripoli. Britain was unwilling to easily give up the land it had already occupied in North Africa. In this meeting, a strategy of avoiding the important and dwelling on the trivial was adopted, and it was decided that Italy should relinquish its rights to its African colonies. The four countries of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union would then decide the legal status of these colonies within one year. If a solution could not be agreed upon within one year, the issue would be submitted to the United Nations for handling.

(4) Regarding the navigation of the Danube, the four countries had recognized that for the sake of world peace and world trade, the Danube and its navigable tributaries and canals should be freely opened to all countries under conditions of complete equality.

Other issues, such as the disposal of the remaining Italian fleet and the issue of British and American troops in Italy and Soviet troops in Bulgaria, were also agreed upon. The Italian issue had been largely resolved, and there was not much difficulty in drafting the peace treaty. The conference was decided to be held in Paris on July 29, and all unresolved issues would be discussed at the conference.

Although the date of the European Peace Conference had been decided, there were still considerable twists and turns before the invitations were issued: one was the issue of inviting countries, and the other was the issue of conference procedures. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov firmly insisted that China should not be an inviting country to the conference, but only an invited country. US Secretary of State Byrnes immediately refuted this, believing that it was an insult to China. Our Foreign Minister Wang also issued a solemn statement. Britain and the United States had once accepted the Soviet Union's proposal, but as a result, under the pressure of public opinion in various countries, the Soviet Union abandoned its stubborn attitude and recognized China as one of the members of the presidium of the conference. The conference was convened in the name of the Five Foreign Ministers' Conference of China, the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France. There was also a dispute over the procedures of the conference. The Soviet Union advocated that the conference procedures should be decided by the four powers and issued together with the invitations. However, Britain and the United States firmly stated that the conference procedures should be finally decided by the plenary session of the 21 countries. As a result, a compromise solution was adopted, with the Foreign Ministers' Conference deciding several principles to be sent to the participating countries in the form of suggestions for their adoption. The French government, in its capacity as the host country, represented the five countries and issued invitations on July 9. The many twists and turns in convening the conference finally came to an end.

The 21-nation European Peace Conference, convened after so many difficulties, has finally been realized today. It is hoped that satisfactory results can be obtained at the conference. This is not only the wish of the foreign ministers involved in the negotiations, but also the wish of people all over the world.

### The Story of This Night

— Zhu Lixing

—Written in Commemoration of the Great Composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart—

"Beethoven is great, but, but our Mozart! Mozart is simply the only great musician in ancient and modern times!" This is what the Italian musician Rossini, one of the world's famous composers, wrote on the last blank page of a volume of Mozart's posthumous works after discovering it. It clearly showed the postscript of the great musician Mozart, who was unprecedented and unparalleled at the time. Therefore, he suddenly realized that this little poem was also inspired by a kind of noble sympathy and stimulated pure altruistic spirit, coupled with his natural talent, and finally wrote that page. Therefore, he—Rossini—was even more certain that Mozart's writings could be said to have exceeded the scope of musical art. Strictly speaking, it was not music, but completely and unreservedly "poetry." This poem is like this, and so are all the posthumous sounds he left us.

The page with the postscript that Rossini discovered was the only miracle in Rossini's life, so it is no wonder that Rossini shed many tears. Later, Rossini felt that being able to admire Mozart's own handwriting was an enlightenment given and encouraged by God to him to admire the sages. Then he spent two years and eight months of hard work and experience, writing the world-famous grand opera (Opera: William Tell) to repay the great kindness of God for creating Mozart and leaving his legacy immortal for all ages.

This poem is (Serenade: Eine Kleine Nachtmusik), a little serenade for this night. After the four-beat sonata, the great composer, our Mozart, wrote the following postscript:

"After the bright moon is smeared by a black cloud, the shadow of the paulownia tree appears particularly clear, but when the light of the bright moon is covered, who can think of the loneliness of the paulownia tree and the souls of all living things in the world that are covered by darkness! Therefore, because of the hasty draft in my mind, I wrote the music score messily with a stone pen. This is a Serenade, divided into four sections. When I hurriedly finished playing it with a triangle piano, the bright moonlight had climbed to the other side of the treetop, and I began to feel drowsy.

"When I looked up, in this quiet universe, the masses of living beings could not see who was encountering the breath of sorrow and anger. The branches swayed in the wind, and the late flowers brought a cold fragrance. I thought I was the most soulful person among living beings, and I felt how lovely life was. God created us, and we have also created everything in the world. This tree, that pile of flowers, were all watered and cultivated by me five years ago to this day. Sure enough, they have also shared the breath of living things in the world for five years. Thinking of this, I opened my Serenade again from my drowsy eyes, and slowly opened the triangle piano, taking advantage of the fact that it was in this world full of "love" when I thought it must be modified, to make it a more perfect poem.

"After the song was finished, the moonlight slanted westward, and there was no one around. In the silence, there was inevitably some loneliness. In the caressing of the breeze, I turned back and looked at the north corner under the paulownia tree. A woman in plain clothes was standing facing the moonlight. I don't know when she approached here. Looking at her, she slowly moved towards me, holding a cloth hat in both hands to wipe her eyes. A faint sound of sobbing came from the wind. When she approached me, I found that she was an old lady in her seventies. Slowly, she put down her hands and seemed to involuntarily rush towards me. She tightly held my arms with her hands, raised her head, and tears fell like raindrops. I already understood that this must not be a sudden encounter. I already felt as if I must use the most sincere feelings to comfort everything she wanted to pour out to me.

"Good child! God, where did you come from! How did you completely play out everything I wanted to the world! Child, listen to me tell a short story, and then insert some of it into your song," the old lady said slowly, holding my arms tightly with both hands.

"Last night, I had just returned home from Italy. It had been almost thirty years since I separated from it. After I received the news of my son's death in battle, I could no longer stay here. So I wandered to Italy. On the night before I left home, because of my reluctance, I hummed the silhouette of my husband and mourned my son's sacrifice for the country here with sobbing sounds. At that time, I vaguely remembered that the tune I hummed was just like the one you just played, but, child! Thirty years ago, were you already listening to my son? I think, at that time, you might not have been born yet!"

"I tell you, my dear child, I am already seventy-four years old this year. I have been living in my lovely but more heartbreaking homeland for forty-four years, thirty years away from it. When I left here thirty years ago, only the bright moon was the same as it was outside, and everything else had changed. But I remember, I will always remember, and I have remembered it in my heart for nearly sixty years, that is, before I gave birth to my son who died for the country, there was also a paulownia tree here, and there was also a pile of peony flowers over there. However, for nearly sixty years, I have gained the reality of despair from hope. Ah! Those elusive fifty-eight years!" She had already turned her sobbing into a desperate smile, but I shed tears.

"Fifty-eight years ago, I was a sixteen-year-old child. To this day, I still remember the night as bright as tonight. My husband, who had only been married for four days, took my hand and walked under such a paulownia tree. I snuggled against his chin, and we both sat down here. He asked me to follow and hum the poem he sang from his mouth, singing and harmonizing to add so much activity to this world, but, ah, my child, fifty-eight years ago, where were you! What you just played was indeed stolen from us at that time, with only a little bit missing. However, what we didn't sing at the time, you have now put it in. Ah, God, are there really such strange things in the world?" The old lady said to me kindly with strange eyes:

"From that night, it seemed that the war between the enemy and us was really unavoidable, but unexpectedly, on the morning of the third day, my twenty-year-old husband, who had only been married for a week, put on his military uniform and went on an expedition. From then on, when the bright moon came every day, I walked slowly here alone, humming this tune in my mouth, and praying to God for protection, hoping that he would return home with glory as soon as possible. I hoped, I hoped like this every night for fifty-eight years. In such a long time, I still taught my son to hum the tune sung by his father, whom he had never met, continuing the second war to die for the country. My son was a posthumous child, but I still hope to this day that his father can return with gray hair and spirit, because I still don't believe he won't return. But, my son has indeed died in battle. Ah! My young and handsome husband, I still don't know where he lives."

"On the eve of my husband's expedition, he and I still came to this paulownia tree and hummed this tune. He told me that life is limited, but art will last forever. If I die for the country one day, you—that is me—you might as well hum this tune every night under the bright moon, hoping that I will return with glory. If I don't return in one day, I will always return in one month. If I don't return in one month, I will always return in one year. If I don't return in one year, I will always return in ten years. If I don't return in ten years, then twenty years, thirty years, forty years, fifty years... I will always return in ten thousand years, so you might as well always hum this tune in hope, hoping that I will return. But, ah! Today, my good child, fifty-eight years have passed like flowing water, and the son who grew up to be twenty-three years old has also gone. Who can believe that the two fathers and sons can return together! But, my child! I have been full of hope in these long fifty-eight years until today, waiting for my husband, my son to return suddenly, but before they return, your serenade has extended my hope for another fifty-eight years. Ah, my child, how limited life is! Please set it up, will they still come back, you say?" As she said this, tears had already choked her throat. I couldn't bear to listen any longer, but, but I decided to insert this tragic encounter into this story of hers fifty-eight years ago.

"From this night, I didn't eat for two days and didn't sleep peacefully for two nights. I used my greatest enthusiasm and effort to write this chapter of Serenade into a completely sad narrative. At the same time, in the last section, I still properly arranged "hope" for her. For more than a month, every night, I always took this triangle piano and helped this old lady to the paulownia tree that I planted with my own hands to play this story, and when I played to the last section of "hope," I played it again and again until she felt that it was possible to reunite with them after waiting another fifty-eight years, and then I made her happily go home to sleep. However, today she passed away without any illness.

"Life is limited, but for fifty-eight years, she always spent this time like flowing water in "hope." Fifty-eight years cannot be considered short, and "hope" is ultimately immortal. This is what I recorded in this chapter of Eine Kleine Nachtmusik, Serenade."

Author's note: This article was written in French and published in Paris, International Music Quarterly, September issue, 1939. After the war, because there were no books on hand, I slightly combined what I remembered in the past to make a chapter. The translator and author are the same person, so there should not be much discrepancy. It must be certified. In addition, 85% of the original manuscript written in French is based on (1) Rossini's Opera (Lyon Conservatory 1902 edition, French version) (2) Beethoven's Biography (Paris Museum 1910 edition, Romain Rolland's original work, French version) (3) Goethe's Letters (Cologne Germanic Academy 1907 edition, French translation), etc. It is attached for identification.

### Writing and Life

— Fang Wuzhi

In the latest Volume Two, Issue Two of "The Youth World," I saw Mr. Zhao Jingshen's "On Writing," which included the sentence, "Don't write about what you don't know." I believe this sentence should be the motto of every novice writer. Because any masterpiece in the world is written with material that the author is very familiar with, such as Fadeyev's "The Rout" and Chekhov's "Ward No. 6." The background of every story is something they are familiar with. With familiar material, combined with genius organization and description, they can produce those vivid things. In other words: it is because of their authoritative genius, coupled with the special skill of describing the bottom line.

A writer who grows up in the international city of Shanghai, if he wants to write about the scenery of Bashan and Shushui, or the lives of the people of Yunnan and Guizhou, no matter how much he racks his brains and wears out thousands of pens, he will not be able to write in a decent manner. Even if he succeeds in a work, it will never be as vivid or moving as the real thing! Thus, if a writer wants to write about something he didn't know before, the only possibility is to personally experience the life in the environment he wants to describe, and deliberately throw himself into a certain embrace for detailed research. Therefore, this is the issue of "Writing and Life" that we want to discuss.

A literary worker, in order to open up a literary path, and in order to create his own brand-new works, must enrich his experience, focus on studying reality, and pay attention to daily life. Only by combining his own real life and writing about the struggle literature with the unique style of the class he stands in, can he always succeed. If a novice writer, after just writing a few stories or a few poems, regards himself as a cultured person and wants to break away from his original living environment to live a monotonous cultural life, it proves that he completely does not understand the meaning of "literary writing should be combined with real life" and will never succeed. Many young literary friends today are abandoning the path of writing because they hold this view and often break away from real life. Know that a literary worker must not despise his own position, because the more adverse the environment, the more real the writing material, and beautiful and great works can be written in the fields and in the mines.

In short, a literary worker should constantly learn and observe the environment in his work, and hunt for the most familiar and typical writing material in the environment. Engels once said: "Creation and the style of a writer, according to my observation, so-called realism, is precise description, and the extraction of real stories from the real environment. Apart from that, it is the description of real life, expressing typical characters in a typical environment..."

Now there is a very popular saying in our society, that is, when we talk about a certain spiritual victor, we always compare him to Ah Q. Because Ah Q is a typical spiritual victor known to everyone, of course, when we talk about this kind of person, only comparing him with Ah Q is the most appropriate. But you must know why this is the case? Because Mr. Lu Xun observed reality and conformed to real life, he observed many similar personalities, and then he created a literary type.

### The Storyteller

— Yi

The storyteller, with a small rectangular striking wood, relying on a glib tongue, a mouth that speaks endlessly, tirelessly opens his deep talk box like a Yellow River breach among many dazed people.

It is rare to see him clean up his head of hair, it is always so disheveled. Under his two sparse eyebrows, a pair of dim and lifeless eyes hides infinite melancholy in his heart. Is he habitually using his unrestrained and rushing mouth to reveal all the melancholy in his heart?

He is an unruly idler, but also a patriot who cares about the people. He sings loudly among the vast, dazed crowd; he calls out; he also points out and pleads among the vast, dazed crowd. He sings loudly about what is worthy of praise in this crowd; he calls out what the crowd should be calling out; he points out the road that this crowd should take; he also laments what makes this crowd sad. He also uses his rectangular striking wood, which always accompanies him, to strike hard at the heads of the generally dazed people.

But the crowd is so stubborn and unrepentant, their dazedness is destined for their mediocre fate. They just open their eyes wide, prick up their ears, and watch and listen to the storyteller's moving actions and pleasant voice aimlessly, without feeling, from his youth until they see his hair turn gray and his voice become hoarse. They listen to the storyteller's stories. The storyteller strikes the table with the striking wood and says with emotion:

"Yue Fei was loyal to the country, but was killed by the old cunning Qin Hui with the trumped-up charge of 'perhaps'..."

Then the vast crowd lets out a slight sigh of indifference. They watch the storyteller's acting. The storyteller uses all his strength to turn his face red, imitating Wu Song's roar when he fought the tiger, and then jumps up and down repeatedly. Then the vast crowd laughs, laughing strangely; they even say he is a clown.

Then the storyteller becomes melancholy, and he regrets that this crowd is incorrigible. The withering of life adds even more melancholy to his heart. But he is helpless. In order to prolong his own withered remaining years, he continues to spin around among the vast and dazed crowd with his small striking wood and his already hoarse voice. But in the end, he finally collapses from exhaustion, but not a single one of the people who have ever listened to or seen him feels sorry for him, because they are still so dazed!

### Music Circle

— Xiting

Shanghai only has one music publication, "Music Magazine." In the past, it was affected by square-shaped publications and could not be sold. We hope that this magazine, the only one in Shanghai that advocates pure music, can sell well.

"Dance Hall Music" affects the general public's ability to appreciate music. How this issue should be handled will be discussed at a symposium to be held by the Music Association recently.

### A Silver Needle Bangle

— Translated by Chen Xing

——Experiences and anecdotes of child psychology——

When I was nine years old, I met a girl who lived across the street. She was visiting her grandmother. Because I met her, my entire universe changed. I was very shy. When I saw her golden hair and rosy face, I was stunned. And those attitudes that were half gentle and half solemn, although they made me uneasy, I couldn't bear to leave. Soon I knew that she was going back to her distant hometown, perhaps never to return.

But between us, there was an absolute need for something to serve as a permanent chain of friendship. So I went to the store to find a perfect gift. In the store, I found an eye-catching silver needle bangle with exquisite patterns engraved on it. Such a thing would be a perfect gift, but its price was quite expensive, not something I could easily afford.

But I had to get it. So I had no choice but to go to my parents tremblingly and say, "Dad, I need fifty cents to buy something important—but I can't tell you what I'm buying, but I think it's very proper and very important."

If he were to force me to say what I was buying, it would be tantamount to pronouncing my death sentence.

My father was the pastor of the parish. In reality, the pastor's child had never even seen fifty cents. But my father listened to my request and stared at me, and finally said, "Child, you go to the study first, and let me and your mother discuss it." Soon he came to the study, gave me fifty cents, and gently patted my shoulder, without saying a word.

So I bought that moving object, put it in a white box, secretly took my father's stationery, and laboriously pieced together a few lines:

"Dear Na Su:

I will definitely miss you very much when we are apart. Please come again! Love, little John"

I placed the gift on the carpet in front of the door across the street. Taking advantage of the fact that no one was watching, I rang the doorbell and fled in a panic.

I got up very early the next morning and intercepted the mailman halfway. Strangely enough, there was indeed a letter addressed to me. I climbed to the top branch of the apple tree and secretly tore it open to read this reply.

"Friend:

Thank you for the beautiful gift. I hope I can come back next summer.

Then I can meet you. Sincerely, Na Su"

Using the words "friend" and "sincerely" to reply to my expensive gift made me a little disappointed. I hid the letter in the porch, preparing to read it repeatedly, but soon my father moved to another parish, and from then on, I never heard from Na Su again.

The facts of the matter—my parents never asked about the purpose of my money. They gently passed through the critical moment. According to my family rules and training, which were strict by modern standards, they still respected my individuality. When I said that my need was important and secret, they accepted my request. My parents trusted me, which made me believe that they would help me with everything that was important to me. If they had refused, unless it was a solemn opinion—there would inevitably be a gap between father and son. I cringe when I hear parents criticize their children for their very childish love affairs or other things that adults find ridiculous. If you recognize your children as "people," with real problems and understanding, the children will naturally feel it and naturally reach the parents' expectations.

Childhood is the beginning of adulthood. Pride, ignorance, bias, irritability, and selfishness should all be suppressed. Children confide their emotions and difficulties to their parents. Parents should not ridicule them, let alone ignore them, because this is precisely the child seeking help in the vast universe.

### Is Abstinence Harmful?

— Yan Juan

(1) The Difficulty of Abstinence

The sexologist Kraft-Ebing once said:

"Women's desire for love is stronger than men's. The only way to satisfy this desire for love properly is marriage. However, in the complex modern life, marriage has become a difficult problem, so the marriage rate is gradually decreasing, and the age of marriage is also getting later. On the men's side, sexual problems are easier to solve in this society, but on the women's side, they have to be suppressed, so they are prone to hysteria. Elderly virgins often age early, which is caused by the inability to satisfy sexual impulses. This problem cannot be solved except by marriage."

These few simple sentences of Ebing's are full of endless thoughts. Even if we cannot unconditionally and completely agree, suppressing sexual desire is indeed the most difficult thing, and no one can avoid this feeling.

(2) Abstinence and Nerves

It has become common sense that abstinence is harmful to the body after a certain age. But Schopenhauer once said:

"Sexual relations are not necessary for your health. If you have absolutely no sexual behavior from birth to old age, then your health will not be harmed."

If, like a great man, you hold a firm belief and live an absolutely abstinent life, then it will not only not harm your health, but will also have a good influence. But if you don't have a firm belief, and you have to abstain after living a married life, then the result of the common sense mentioned above will occur.

Lewin Falt has the following statistical report:

"For men aged twenty-four or five, there is no harm in starting absolute abstinence. For men aged twenty-five to thirty-six, if they have been married and abstain, then strong people will exhibit neurotic symptoms, such as irritability, sexual hyperactivity, aversion to work, and mild dizziness. Nervous people will develop depression, melancholia, etc. On the women's side, although they can tolerate abstinence better than men after marriage, many nervous people will also develop hysteria, neurasthenia, etc."

Due to abstinence, the intense sexual impulses are suppressed, causing the central nervous system to become fatigued and even hypersensitive, thus affecting health.

Therefore, in the period when sexual impulses are extremely weak, or for those who have not experienced intense impulses, an abstinent life is not harmful. If the intense sexual impulses are suppressed for a long time, it will definitely make the central nervous system extremely fatigued, and when an accidental cause is encountered, symptoms of neurosis will occur; moreover, because of long-term mental tension, it will often turn into a narrow personality. However, for people with strong constitutions and nervous systems, it will not cause any harm. Therefore, whether an abstinent life is harmful or not depends mostly on the strength of each person's innate nervous system.

### How to Make Many Fortune Cakes?

— Mu Mei

If you have a daughter studying at school, you have probably received a ration of milk powder recently, right? But the rationed milk powder you received is very coarse in quality. If you brew it and drink it, it is not only unpleasant in taste, but also has sediment. Your children probably don't like to drink it, right? So how do you dispose of this milk powder?

What I want to talk about here is using this milk powder to make a kind of snack called "Many Fortune Cakes." What are "Many Fortune Cakes"? If you have a strong memory, you may still remember that you could buy ten of those circle-shaped snacks for one yuan in the basement of the Great World Company many years ago, right? These are called "Many Fortune Cakes." Originally, this kind of snack used flour as the main ingredient and was mixed with milk. Now, milk powder is used to save on milk.

Ingredients: Twelve ounces of milk powder, four ounces of flour, four ounces of white sugar. (You can add more if you like sweets.) One small teaspoon of baking soda, two raw chicken eggs, half a catty of raw oil.

Method: Except for pouring half a catty of raw oil into the pot to prepare for cooking, first break the chicken eggs, and mix them into the above ingredients, making sure that the milk powder, sugar, and other things are thoroughly mixed. If the egg juice and sugar juice are not enough to moisten the milk powder, you can add half a tablespoon of raw oil. If it is still not enough, you can add a little water, but it should not be too wet. Generally, mix it until it is like the kind used for making noodles. After mixing, pick it into pieces the size of longan, and then rub the pieces into thin strips, about three inches long, and put the two ends together to form a circle. Put the made circles one by one on a plate to prevent sticking. First, sprinkle a layer of dry flour on the bottom of the plate. At that time, you can start a fire to cook the oil. Wait until the oil is thoroughly boiled, and then you can gradually put the made circles into the oil pan to fry. When you see them slightly yellow, use chopsticks to pick them up. This is homemade Many Fortune Cakes. Eating them while they are hot is fragrant, crispy, and nutritious and hygienic. Moreover, it doesn't cost much money! If you make more, you can put them in a cookie box or a glass jar to prevent moisture and store them for many days. I think, instead of giving money to your children on such a hot day and letting them go outside to buy unclean cold drinks or snacks to eat, which may lead to seasonal epidemics, it is better for you to work hard and make some Many Fortune Cakes for them to eat.

If you are happy, you can start doing it now. New Home Furnishings: New-style Active Tables and Chairs

### Black Suzhou Creek

— Shao Fu

The Blue Danube is sentimental, while the Black Suzhou Creek is shameful. The Danube produced musicians and poets, while the Suzhou Creek evokes feelings of revulsion.

I walk past the Suzhou Creek every day. I dare not look down at the dark, turbid stream. I look up at the sky, which is high and clear, with distinct blue and white colors. But the stench emanating from this thirsty stream rushes straight into my nostrils, like the foul and fishy breath spewed from the mouth of a venomous python, haunting you, the nearly four million citizens of Shanghai, like a ghost. You live in that kind of atmosphere every day.

If we use the human body as an analogy, this is a festering appendix that can endanger a person's life.

It seems like an incomprehensible myth that the claws of the cholera demon have stopped dancing. Some people say that God blesses the people of Shanghai! If we take this chance encounter as a common occurrence, that is suicide. God only helps those who help themselves.

I am not an engineer in the Public Works Bureau, and I don't know how deep the Suzhou Creek is now, but I believe that it would never have been so shallow before. But I believe even more that it will become even shallower than it is now, until one day the silt (including garbage) is level with both banks, and the Suzhou Creek becomes a garbage road.

It would be better to simply fill it in to make a road, like turning the Yangjingbang into the Zhongzheng Road. Wouldn't that facilitate transportation and benefit the citizens?

The Suzhou Creek is black, although it connects to the Huangpu River and the sea. What does black represent? It represents terror, death, filth, and meanness, but also shame and sorrow.

The nearly four million citizens of Shanghai see it. Can they turn a blind eye?

### Scores Above All, Diplomas First, Dead Education, Dead Textbooks

— Qiu Jian

I recently read the editorial in this newspaper, "The Education System Urgently Needs Reform," and as a student under this system, I felt a particularly strong resonance. I believe that the failure of China's new education in terms of moral education, as pointed out in the article, is particularly worth emphasizing. To give an example: the rule of not spitting anywhere is something that almost every student from elementary school to junior high school can often see in books or public places. But colleges are still full of people who spit everywhere. As for other things, it goes without saying: disorder at meetings, cheating in examinations, vandalism, not keeping time, in short: the current schools, in addition to teaching students how to read fluently, or even memorize their books, do not bother to take care of everything else.

The students' only goal has become scores. For the sake of scores, they will not hesitate to sacrifice—sacrificing their health by staying up late is nothing, and they even sell their self-esteem to cheat. In fact, the more "strictly managed" schools are often the concentration camps of cheating geniuses. When those students leave school, it is difficult to guarantee that their goals will not turn into money or power, so they will do everything possible, regardless of everything, to cheat and seek personal gain in order to achieve their goals.

And what exactly has the heavy homework brought to the students? We won't talk about lung disease and insomnia. It is even more a matter of course to rush to do homework as soon as school is over. As a result, a student majoring in electrical engineering still has to pay someone to repair the electric fan at home when it breaks; a mechanical engineering graduate has not even made a single screw. Not to mention the practical ones, let's just talk about the theoretical ones. Formulas that were memorized last year are forgotten this year. Questions that scored ninety-nine points on the last semester's exam cannot be answered when asked this semester. The students are not unaware of this phenomenon, but they still stay up late and memorize the books as usual. The professors also don't understand the difficulties of the students, but they still stuff knowledge into the students' brains as usual.

So, those ducks who have been stuffed continuously for more than ten years are finally sent out of the school in batches. They open their eyes, which have been dazzled by homework, and take a look—oh dear, what kind of world is this? They discover all kinds of strange phenomena that are not mentioned in the books, and they encounter all kinds of people. They may be dissatisfied with the environment, but their bodies, which have been worn down by books for many years, are already powerless. They have no fundamental moral values, they lack a outlook on life, and even fewer people have a firm will. So when the evil forces in this evil society invade them, they are swallowed.

In short, the current education is only desperately increasing the weight of the students' heads, without asking them to exercise their bodies and minds, let alone fundamentally educate them to become healthy and upright citizens. If the head is heavy and the feet are light, wouldn't it fall down? This is common sense!

### The Land of Forgetfulness

— Meng Bai

"China will not perish, China will not perish, look at the national hero Regiment Commander Xie!" This song once resonated throughout the entire nation. Its righteous and powerful melody stirred the hearts of the old, young, men, and women, and awakened tens of millions of spirited youths, who threw their heads and spilled their blood, dedicating themselves to the nation. Now, they have fulfilled their final duty and lie buried in the ground, but the General's surviving family members are destitute and helpless!

Almost a year after the victory of the War of Resistance, famine, banditry, and economic depression are rampant. However, in Shanghai, a city of singing and dancing, those who make merry are everywhere, squandering resources without restraint, and indulging themselves day and night! Have they forgotten the soldiers who endured pain and bled to death on the battlefield for the sake of the nation and the people? Have they forgotten the martyrs who died under the brutal oppression of the enemy and puppets, suffering severe torture for their unwavering righteousness? The dead are dead, but are we simply treating them as historical relics? Are we simply consigning their glorious deeds to the National History Museum, and considering the matter settled? Is this how a civilized ancient nation forgets so easily?

Brief Collection of Comments

### Court Fines Also Need Adjustment

— Wu Ling Ren

The amount of fines imposed by the courts for criminal cases has also increased significantly with the changing environment. For example, gambler Zhu Shunlin, in addition to a four-year prison sentence, was also fined 100 million yuan. St. Francis student Xu Pei-huang and his father were fined 15,000 yuan each for defaming others. If they were unable to pay, it would be commuted to one day of labor service for every 500 yuan. I remember that before the war, it was generally one yuan for one day of labor service. Now, compared to before the war, it has increased five hundred times! And if the fine of 100 million yuan is also calculated by multiplying the pre-war amount by 500, then Zhu Shunlin's fine before the war would have been 200,000 yuan. In today's era of daily currency depreciation, will the fines imposed by the courts in the future also need to be "adjusted" from time to time?

The Office of the Receiving Work Investigation Team has been established to seek public opinion and facilitate investigation. It will invite responsible persons from various industries to listen to their opinions. In fact, the opinions of various industries on the receiving work have already been widely published in various newspapers in the past. Just using these many opinions as a basis for starting the investigation would be troublesome enough, but the Investigation Team is not afraid of even more trouble and wants to listen extensively again. Their spirit of diligently seeking public opinion is truly admirable.

The Administrative Yuan Compensation Investigation Committee is urging the reporting of wartime public and private property losses, but among the many people I know, I have not heard of anyone who has filled out a loss report form. The past pain has long been forgotten, and no one wants to seek compensation for past losses. Is this the demeanor of a great nation?

A foreign country has invented a wind instrument alarm clock, which is said to "have pleasant music, without harsh ringing." If this product arrives in Shanghai, I will definitely buy one at great expense as soon as possible, because I often suffer from insomnia. Having a clock with pleasant music on the bedside is perfect for lulling me to sleep.

### Grumbling

— Wu Jian Hua

A female student and a male student, both under twenty years old and unmarried, actually went to Hangzhou together for a "honeymoon." Afterwards, the guardian filed a lawsuit for interference with the family, but the male and female protagonists actually said in court that this was their freedom, causing the audience to burst into laughter. "Democracy" is only in its infancy, but "freedom" has already been so abused. And this pair of protagonists, one is a student from XX Girls' High School, and the other is a Freshman from XX University. They are so young, yet already so indulgent and so knowledgeable about "freedom." It's lamentable!

I certainly dare not be an old fogey, with a serious face, but the necessity of the marriage system is undeniable, otherwise how can the organization of society be maintained?

### How Unfair!

— You Fu

The heroic battle of the "Eight Hundred Warriors" defending the Sihang Warehouse once shocked the world.

In history, this earth-shattering battle of the isolated army, the Eight Hundred Warriors wrote a glorious and brilliant page with their fresh blood and flesh, forever immortal!

Now, victory is approaching a year, and the surviving family of the late Regiment Commander Xie are still wandering aimlessly, without any place to rely on. The General's surviving family members are like a lone boat, drifting on the vast ocean! Perhaps it is that victory came too quickly, and the power of the atomic bomb obliterated the merit of the naked flesh and blood fighting, burying the sacrifices of countless heads in the past!

Now, the loyal bones of Regiment Commander Xie have been buried on the banks of the Huangpu River. Our national hero has shed all his blood, and he lies smiling peacefully in the netherworld. However, he could not have imagined that after his glorious death, his surviving family members would be so pitiful, with no one caring.

The Chinese people are sensitive and forgetful. In the beginning, everyone was eager to praise Xie Jinyuan, but now that Japan has been defeated, everyone has forgotten everything!

It is hoped that the government will come up with a solution, and the orphaned children of soldiers should be given comfort!

It is hoped that the citizens of Shanghai will revisit the heroic historical facts of that year and extend a helping hand of sympathy.

Finally, it must be pointed out that even today, we must still insist on two major demands: those who indulged in pleasure and supported the enemy during the war must be severely punished, and the orphaned children of soldiers who sacrificed themselves for the country must be guaranteed! The Xie family's orphaned children have no way to borrow, and XXX is at large. We will never accept this!

### A Doggerel

— Adapted from Li Houzhu's "Yu Mei Ren"

An hour has passed,

Yet many cars amass.

Could it be "all the way" is not smooth,

Forever unable to move into the road's groove?

The red post is clearly there,

Yet stopping place, they dare to re-pair!

Crushing me, yet unable to move, I fret,

Only hating those,

Forcefully reducing cars,

A violent set!

### Campus Miscellany

The desks in the classroom are broken beyond repair, some stools have only three legs, and the spittoons are only emptied every two or three days. There is only one tank for tea, and it is never refilled after it is finished. The handrails of the escalator are covered with an inch of dust. Miscellaneous fees are not only not waived, but are collected very heavily, but the principal only knows how to save money.

"Students' exercise books and notebooks should be purchased from the school to ensure uniformity." However, white Daolin paper notebooks outside the school only sell for 300 yuan per copy, while white newsprint notebooks inside the school cost no less than 400 yuan per copy.

### Traitors Are Well

— Bai Lian

He is still eating coffee with milk, riding in a jeep in good condition, wearing a suit and leather shoes, going to interesting places, holding women and dancing waltzes and congas. Do you want to ask who he is? Do you want me to say it without hesitation: He has grabbed those chops engraved with "Minister of Finance," "President of the Central Reserve Bank," "Mayor of Shanghai," and "President of the Executive Yuan," and stamped official documents one after another. It was he who took away our old legal tender, and it was he who took away our gold, using the puppet currency he issued himself, whose value was not even worth a fart! He is a big traitor, a criminal in the financial world, and a traitor who sold out the Republic of China. His crimes are not enough to be compensated even by death, but he has not even been to jail!
