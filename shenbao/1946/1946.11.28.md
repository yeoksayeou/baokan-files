With an extremely solemn ceremony, he will submit the Draft Constitution of the Republic of China for discussion by the assembly, and address all representatives on the drafting process of the constitutional draft.

In addition to the above ceremony and Chairman Chiang's report, the Third Session will include a report from the Secretariat on the minutes of the previous meeting, as well as congratulatory messages and customary greetings. When the assembly continues in the afternoon, Sun Ke will report. Discussion of the constitutional draft will begin on the 28th. Furthermore, representative seating will remain the same on the 28th, and will follow the newly drawn seating chart from the 29th onwards. Also, the seats reserved for the Communist Party and the Democratic League will be retained, awaiting their participation at any time, demonstrating the government's attitude of magnanimity. These new seating charts have already been printed and will be distributed to all representatives and reporters for their use in the afternoon of the 28th.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 27th] The Presidium of the National Assembly held its Sixth Meeting at 10:00 AM on the 27th. Attendees included Chiang Chung-cheng, Zuo Shunsheng, Chen Qitian, and Liu Hengjing, among others. Zou Lu chaired the meeting, and the following resolutions were passed: A. The Representative Qualification Review Committee will be composed of the following three parts: (1) Conveners of the candidates recommended by each unit to the Presidium; (2) Those who received the next highest number of votes for the candidates recommended by each unit to the Presidium; (3) Representative Zhang Lisheng, Director of the National Assembly Representative Election Headquarters. The above personnel will serve as committee members and will be convened by Representative Zhang Lisheng. B. Regarding the procedure for the assembly's discussion of the constitutional draft, it was decided that Chairman Chiang of the National Government will submit the Draft Constitution of the Republic of China to the assembly. The discussion procedure will first involve a general debate, followed by chapter-by-chapter review. C. The original plan was to nominate Representative Chiang Chung-cheng as Chairman of the Third Session, but now Representative Hu Shi has been nominated instead.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 27th] In addition to Hu Shi, the Presidium of the Third Session of the National Assembly on the 28th will include Zeng Qi, Bai Chongxi, Chen Guofu, Zhu Jingnong, Hu Shuhua, He Chengjün, Liang Hancao, Huang Yünsu, Duan Xipeng, and Xu Fulin, from the Third Group.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 27th] Seven National Assembly representatives registered on the 27th: two regional representatives, two occupational representatives, the social notable Yan Yangchu, Tao Xisheng, directly selected by the National Government, and Kuai Chao of the Social Democratic Party. Including the previous registrations, the total number of registered representatives is 1,623. The National Government announced 1,744 representatives, leaving 121 yet to register. Furthermore, the National Assembly staff badges and entry passes will be reissued again. Temporary entry passes will be issued first on the morning of the 28th, and the new passes will be used from the 29th.

### Amending the Draft Constitution at the National Assembly; All Based on the Resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference; Minister Peng Declares at a Press Conference

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 27th] The Ministry of Information held a press conference at 3:30 PM on the 27th in the representatives' lounge of the National Assembly Hall, hosted by Peng Xuepei. The newly appointed Ambassador to the Holy See, Wu Jingxiong, was also invited to attend, to answer questions from reporters regarding the constitutional draft. Peng first answered reporters' questions as follows:

Question: What are the announced quotas and allocations for each party within the National Assembly representatives?

Answer: The total number of National Assembly representatives is 2,050. The National Government has announced 1,744 representatives, of which 847 are non-partisan, accounting for 48% of the total. The Kuomintang has 725 representatives, accounting for 42% of the total. The remaining 118 are from the Youth Party, and 54 from the Democratic Socialist Party, together accounting for 10%. Regarding the "iron party" issue, when the first National Political Consultative Conference was convened in 1938, the Social Democratic Party, the Communist Party, the Youth Party, and the Kuomintang were all present, of which three "iron parties" have already participated in the National Assembly. Furthermore, the Political Consultative Conference convened this spring was attended by five parties: the Kuomintang, the Communist Party, the Youth Party, social notables, and the Democratic League. Currently, only the Communist Party and a portion of the Democratic League have not participated in the National Assembly. Therefore, the claim that the Kuomintang is holding the National Assembly alone is inaccurate and a misrepresentation.

Question: Some people have criticized the government for violating the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. What is your opinion?

Answer: The best answer to this question is the constitutional draft itself. The currently revised Draft Constitution of the Republic of China is based on and revised according to the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. Furthermore, we can examine who first instigated military action in the Northeast, who constantly sabotaged transportation, refused to participate in the National Government Committee, refused to nominate candidates, and refused to participate in the National Assembly? And who secretly conducted the so-called "People's Congress," preventing the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference from being implemented? It is not difficult to understand who is responsible.

Question: To what extent does the National Assembly comply with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference?

Answer: Its non-violation of the Political Consultative Conference can be explained in three points: (1) Date: The Political Consultative Conference decided that the National Assembly would be convened on May 5th of this year. Subsequently, the Communist Party and other "iron parties" requested a postponement to November. When the time came, the Communist Party still refused to participate. This clearly shows who is enthusiastic about implementing the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and who is not. (2) Quotas: The current allocation of quotas is still based on the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. The vacant seats of the Communist Party and the Democratic League are still being reserved for their participation. (3) The constitutional draft is based on the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and is revised to be adopted by the National Assembly.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 27th] At the press conference held by the Ministry of Information on the 27th, when asked about the statement by a government spokesman quoted in a dispatch from Reuters correspondent Logan in Nanjing on the 26th, that if the Communist Party decides to convene a so-called "People's Congress in the Liberated Areas" and the Communist army continues to attack Suinan and Yulin, the National Army will launch a punitive offensive against Yan'an, Minister Peng replied: "The government has indeed received reports about the Communist Party's attempt to convene a so-called 'People's Congress in the Liberated Areas,' but we hope it is not true. As for the matters stated in the Reuters dispatch, it was not a conversation I had and may be due to a misinterpretation of the Zhongshi News Agency's draft on the same day."

### Spokesman for the CCP in Nanjing Denies Convening a People's Congress

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 27th] Mei Yi, a spokesman for the CCP office, denied reports on the 27th evening that the Communist army would convene a People's Congress in the Liberated Areas and that the Eighth Route Army was attacking Yulin, stating that there was no such thing. Regarding the report by a certain military observer that "the government will be forced to attack Yan'an," he said that the government's intention to attack Yan'an had long been heard, but it was worth noting whether this news, after being issued, would be put into action starting from today. This news has also been telegraphed to the Yan'an Border Region Government today. Mei also denied the rumor that Mao Zedong had left Yan'an for the Soviet Union, saying that since the 29th of this month is Zhu De's 60th birthday, Mao will stay in Yan'an to celebrate and will definitely not leave.

### Infighting Among Senior CCP Generals Becoming Increasingly Apparent

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 27th] It has been learned here that the infighting among senior generals on the Yan'an CCP side has become increasingly apparent. Mao Zedong, leading his direct line generals Zhu De, He Long, Lin Biao, Chen Yi, Liu Bocheng, and others, firmly advocates seizing power through military means. Chen Shaoyu, Feng Wenbin, Wang Jiaxiang, Lu Dingyi, Liu Shaoqi, Li Fuchun, and others advocate striving for power through political means. Therefore, Mao is carrying out the second rectification movement, attacking the Chen faction, and ordering party members to monitor their actions and freedom, except when necessary to avoid emergency danger, maintain social order, or promote public interests, shall not be restricted by law." I once researched a clause that seemed better than Mr. Zhang Junmai's, but for the sake of democracy, I abandoned it.

(3) In Chapter 3, the addition of a provision for National Assembly representatives to serve on the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan was criticized by followers of Sun Yat-sen, who believed that the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan were governing bodies, while the National Assembly was a political body, and should be independent of each other and not confused. However, because Mr. Zhang Junmai insisted on the principle of parliamentary politics, although we believed that according to Sun Yat-sen's teachings, the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan should be responsible to the National Assembly, we ultimately relented. In my opinion, political power and governing power are logically separate, but in practice they should be connected in order to be used flexibly, and there are currently some legislators and political officials who are representatives to the National Assembly.

(4) In Chapter 4, the powers of the president have been changed very little. The Political Consultative Conference once wanted to delete Article 45 of the Fifth Fifth Constitution Draft, which stated that "The President may convene the heads of the five Yuan to discuss matters concerning two or more Yuan and matters on which the President seeks advice," but at the last review meeting (Communist Party representatives were not present), Mr. Zhang Junmai pointed out that if disputes arise between the Yuan, and the National Assembly is not in session, and there is no special person or institution to mediate, how can the disputes be resolved? Political affairs will inevitably be greatly affected. Later, it was decided to compromise and revise it to "The President may convene the heads of the relevant Yuan to discuss and resolve disputes between the Yuan, except as otherwise provided in this Constitution."

(5) Regarding the relationship between the Legislative Yuan and the Executive Yuan, the Fifth Fifth Constitution Draft treated them as independent entities, not responsible to the National Assembly. Now, adopting the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, it has been revised to require the President to obtain the consent of the Legislative Yuan for the appointment of the President of the Executive Yuan, and the Executive Yuan is also responsible to the Legislative Yuan for certain matters. This has adopted some of the checks and balances principles of the American Constitution, which can be said to be a limited presidential system, with some elements of a cabinet system.

(6) In Chapter 10, regarding the powers of the central and local governments, some changes have been made compared to the Fifth Fifth Constitution Draft, in accordance with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. The national political system is neither a federal system nor an absolutely unitary system. This new type of system can be regarded as China's contribution to constitutional law. As for the popular election of provincial governors and the enhancement of the status of provinces, this is both a resolution of the Political Consultative Conference and Sun Yat-sen's original intention.

(7) The interpretation of the Constitution has been changed in every draft since 1925. The Fifth Fifth Constitution Draft stipulated that it should be proposed by the Control Yuan and implemented by the Judicial Yuan, while the revised draft attributes it to the Judicial Yuan, as it has been determined that the Judicial Yuan is the highest judicial body. Mr. Wu first explained in English, then briefly translated it into Chinese, using vivid metaphors and eloquent language. He also stated that although he attended the reception at the invitation of Minister Peng, his interpretations were not representative of the official position, but were merely expressed in a personal capacity. Finally, he expressed his personal views on the revised draft, saying: "I believe that law is a practical science, and in order for it to be implemented and to be effective, it must be supported by the public. Now that the revised draft includes opinions from all parties, it is more complete and easier to implement than the Fifth Fifth Constitution Draft. Therefore, despite the revisions to the Fifth Fifth Constitution Draft, I still express my heartfelt satisfaction with the revised draft."

### Ambassador Wu Jingxiong Scheduled to Depart for Rome

[Report from Our Newspaper] Dr. Wu Jingxiong, our ambassador to the Holy See in Rome, has reserved a cabin on the French postal ship General Xiafei, scheduled to depart from Shanghai on December 20th, accompanied by his family and staff.

### Wu Jingxiong Explains the Constitution; A Comparison of the Fifth Fifth Constitution Draft and the Political Consultative Conference Constitution Draft

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 27th] Wu Jingxiong, one of the drafters of the Fifth Fifth Constitution Draft and a participant in the revision of the constitutional draft, explained the key points of the revised draft at a press conference held by the Ministry of Information on the afternoon of the 27th, as follows:

Article 1 of Chapter 1 of the Fifth Fifth Constitution Draft stated that "The Republic of China is a Republic based on the Three Principles of the People." Now, according to the opinions of various parties, it has been changed to "The Republic of China is a democratic republic based on the Three Principles of the People, of the People, by the People, and for the People." Although the wording is more cumbersome, the spirit is not greatly different. What differs from the United States is that President Lincoln's "of the people, by the people, for the people" refers to the nature of the government. The revised draft's "Owned by the People," "Governed by the People," and "Enjoyed by the People" refer to the nation [Republic the wealth]. "Of the people," "by the people," and "for the people" refer to the nature of the government.

(2) In Chapter 2, regarding the freedom of the people, the Fifth Fifth Constitution Draft had the clause "Shall not be restricted except in accordance with the law." Now, according to the resolution of the Political Consultative Conference, positive guarantees are used to replace negative guarantees, and the clause is removed. However, in order to prevent freedom from becoming unbridled, Article 24 has been added: "Regarding the freedoms and rights listed above, except for the purpose of preventing obstruction of others

### Two Representatives of the Democratic Socialist Party Fly to Nanjing; Cadres of the People's Socialist Party to Hold Meeting Today; Jiang Yuntian Discusses Opinions on Withdrawing from the Democratic League

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 27th] Due to difficulties in securing seats on China National Aviation Corporation flights, Democratic Socialist Party National Assembly representatives Shi Zhiquan (legal scholar, currently President of Chaoyang College) and Wang Zhihai did not leave Beiping for Nanjing until 8:30 AM on the 27th. Veteran of the Beiping branch of the party, Ji Yiqiao, traveled with them. It is also reported that Zhang Dongsun, Hu Haimen, Liang Qiushui, and others oppose participating in the National Assembly. Key members of the Democratic Socialist Party will hold a meeting at Liang Qiushui's residence tomorrow afternoon, where they may further express their views to the public.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 27th] A reporter recently inquired with Jiang Yuntian, a member of the Standing Committee of the Democratic Socialist Party, about rumors that the Democratic Socialist Party was considering withdrawing from the Democratic League. According to him, it is not necessarily that the Democratic Socialist Party must leave the Democratic League, but rather whether their opinions are the same. If they are not the same, then separation is only natural. As for rumors that Zhang Dongsun and Hu Haimen are leaving the Democratic Socialist Party, there is absolutely no basis for that. Furthermore, Lei Zhen, Secretary-General of the Political Consultative Conference, hosted a banquet for Democratic Socialist Party members Jiang Yuntian, Xu Fulin, Wu Xianzi, and Yang Junming on the evening of the 27th.

### Ministry of National Defense Denies Rumors

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] According to a spokesperson for the Ministry of National Defense, the report in the Nanjing Evening News on the 27th that "a confidential military meeting was held at the residence of Chief of Staff Chen Cheng on the night of the 25th, which made important decisions to thoroughly resolve the Communist army" is completely untrue.

### Du Yuming Returns to the Northeast

Only Over Ten Thousand Japanese Troops in the Greater Khingan Range

The Government is Negotiating for Their Surrender

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 27th] Du Yuming flew back to the Northeast at 11:55 AM on the 27th aboard a Tianxiong aircraft of the Air Transport Corps. Those who saw him off at the airport included Tang Enbo and Leng Xin.

[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 27th] A senior liaison officer of the Northeast Security Command stationed in Nanjing stated that rumors that there are still 100,000 armed Japanese troops active in the Greater Khingan Range are untrue. There are only 14,500 Japanese soldiers in the area, and the government is negotiating to have them surrender.

### Ye Jianying Flies to Harbin

To Discuss Coordination Work in the Northeast

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 27th] Ye Jianying, the Communist Party representative of the Beiping Military Mediation Department, arrived in Changchun by plane from Beiping at 11:00 AM on the 27th. After a one-hour stop at the airport, he continued his flight to Harbin. It is said that this trip is to discuss how to carry out coordination work in the Northeast in the future. Zhou Liwu, the Chief of Staff of the government side of the Changchun Branch, went to the airport to meet him. Furthermore, Colonel Tyson, the American Executive Director of the Changchun Branch, and Wu Xiuquan, the Communist Party representative, also flew to Harbin on the same plane.

### Ambassador Stuart Returns to Nanjing

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] Ambassador John Leighton Stuart, who visited Shanghai last week, returned to the capital by special plane from Shanghai at 11:30 AM on the morning of the 27th. Fu Jingbo and Mr. and Mrs. Connors, spokespersons for the embassy, accompanied him.

### Special Envoy Marshall Leaves Beiping in a Howling Wind; The Marshall Couple Arrive in Qingdao; To Meet with Admiral Cooke and Return to Nanjing Today

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 27th] Special Envoy Marshall and his wife left Beiping for Qingdao on their way back to Nanjing at 10:40 AM on the 27th. It is understood that they will confer with Admiral Cooke while passing through Qingdao. Mr. and Mrs. Marshall had breakfast with Gillon at the residence at 9:00 AM on the morning of the 27th, and then drove to the airport in the howling wind. Because senior officials in Beiping were not informed of the exact date of his departure in advance, only Mayor He Siyuan, Police Chief Tang Yongxian, and Hu Zhongjing, Director of the Foreign Affairs Office of the Eleventh War Zone, were present at the airport to see him off. Aside from Gillon and two or three others, no one knows the purpose of Marshall's trip. At Sun Lianzhong's banquet last night, Marshall only talked about past events in Tianjin and did not mention anything else. A qualified person hinted to reporters that Marshall's trip is still an effort for peace, and his specific tasks may be: (1) To stabilize the Military Mediation Department and inject a strong dose of reassurance into the ailing Military Mediation Department. (2) To prepare for a trip to Yan'an, using Ye Jianying as a bridge to conduct some preliminary discussions. However, it is not known whether Marshall himself still has strong confidence in this effort. It is rumored that Marshall's speech at the welcome party for Yenching University alumni was filled with pessimism. He said that the mediation work was like climbing a mountain, and just as he was about to reach the top, he was blocked by some people and pushed back down. China's economy is on the verge of collapse, and if it were in the United States, the people would definitely protest, but the Chinese people have no power.

[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 27th] Special Envoy Marshall and his wife flew to Qingdao on the morning of the 27th. All the leaders went to the airport to welcome them. After Marshall got off the plane, he drove to Admiral Cooke's residence to rest. They are scheduled to fly back to Nanjing by special plane on the morning of the 28th.

[Another Dispatch] Mr. Marshall visited the Central Naval Training Corps in the afternoon of the 27th, and was guided by Lin Xiangguang, Director of the Corps, and Colonel Ting, the US Navy Advisor, to tour the facility. He praised the training methods and the spirit of the trainees.

Marshal Marshall (left) shook hands with Brigadier General Noble, Deputy Commander of the U.S. Marine Corps, who welcomed him at the airport when he arrived in Tianjin from Nanjing on the 23rd. Behind Marshal Marshall is Major General Howard, Commander of the U.S. Marine Corps. In the center is Du Jianshi, the Mayor of Tianjin, and holding a felt hat is Smith, the U.S. Consul General in Tianjin. (Photo by the U.S. Marine Corps)

### Communist Troops Launch Large-Scale Offensive Against Guomindang Troops Encirclement Offensive in Hebei-Henan Region; Fierce Fighting South of Puyang, Guomindang Troops Retreat

[Central News Agency, Baoding, 27th] According to a statement from relevant authorities, more than 80,000 Communist troops, driving tens of thousands of civilians, have moved to the front lines and launched a large-scale offensive southward from Puyang, implementing a large encirclement of Guomindang troops in southern Hebei and northern Henan. In order to comply with the ceasefire order, our troops have adopted a completely defensive posture and advised them to stop their attacks. The Communist troops took the opportunity to launch a fierce attack. In the area south of Puyang and east of Hua County, there was fierce fighting for three days and three nights starting on November 18th. The Guomindang troops were forced to retreat, and the Communist troops continued to intensify their offensive.

[Another Dispatch] On the evening of the 26th, the Communist troops completely gathered the residents of Daying Village in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway, forcibly moved them to the mountainous area of Mancheng, and set fire to their houses before leaving, creating an extremely tragic situation.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 27th] Although the Communist troops in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway are moving frequently, no large-scale battles have occurred yet. The strength of the Guomindang troops is gradually increasing. The situation between Baoding and Ding County in the south is slightly worse. Yujiazhuang, Fangshunqiao, and Wangdu are still under the control of the Communist troops. The Wangdu County Chief has arrived in Baoding with the security police team. The military stated that, judging from the movements of the Communist troops, they are likely to repeat the offensive of September, and at the same time prepare for large-scale destruction of the railway, launching a general offensive against Liulihe, Zhuozidian, and Liangxiang stations north of Zhuozhou County. Currently, there are more than 20,000 Communist troops in Zhangfang Town west of Zhuozhou County, more than 10,000 in Maji Town to the east, and more than 2,000 in the area more than ten miles west of Songlindian. With the reinforcements from the Guomindang troops yesterday and today, the situation in Baoding, Caohe, and Xushui has stabilized. The roadbed between Dingxing and Caohe, which is not yet open to traffic in the Ping-Bao section, has been laid. Because two Japanese material depots that had not been handed over were newly discovered near Changxindian, there is no problem with materials. The difficulty lies in the North River Bridge project. Therefore, the completion of the Ping-Bao section is expected to be in the middle of next month. Furthermore, the central section of the Ping-Sui Railway between Zhangjiakou and Datong can be completed by the end of the year, and traffic can be opened on New Year's Day next year.

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 27th] (1) The Communist troops who invaded and occupied Daning in western Shanxi continued to flee towards Xi County on the 23rd and 24th, and replenished a large amount of ammunition to the west of the river. Their strength has now reached more than 10,000, with many mountain field guns. (2) The Communist troops who fled to the southeast of Guanshi Town, in order to cooperate with the northward invasion from Daning and encircle Xi County, also launched a fierce attack on Licun, Nanshengou, and Nanpingshan, north of the county seat, on the 25th.

[Another Dispatch] Two brigades of Communist troops stationed in Shuo County in northern Shanxi invaded and attacked Shanyin (i.e., Daiyue Town) on the 20th. The Guomindang troops stationed there defended their original positions and repeatedly frustrated their fierce attacks, but were forced to retreat to Ying County due to the overwhelming disparity in numbers.

### Concentrating Eighteen Regiments of Troops in Northern Jiangsu; Communist Troops Attempt to Attack Dongtai; Songji North of Huaiyin Captured Yesterday

[Our Taizhou Dispatch, 27th] The short period of peace in northern Jiangsu has suddenly been replaced by a sense that a storm is about to break out. The Communist troops have concentrated eighteen regiments of troops on the outskirts of Dongtai City, threatening to attack Dongtai. The tension near Huaiyin may be a prelude to a major battle. The Guomindang troops stationed in Dongtai are currently making proper deployments and paying close attention to defense. If the Communist troops recklessly disrupt the ceasefire and harass Dongtai, the Guomindang troops will launch a self-defense counterattack within a certain scope.

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 27th] Songji, north of Siyang, was recaptured by the Guomindang troops on the 25th. In this battle, the Communist troops suffered more than 5,000 casualties. The Communist troops are now continuously reinforcing Siyang. However, the Communist troops in northern Jiangsu are currently lacking both weapons and ammunition, and it will be difficult for the offensive to last. Once the Guomindang troops are forced to counterattack, the Communist troops on that line can be completely eliminated in one fell swoop.

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 27th] It is learned that Wulizhuang in Songji, north of Huaiyin, was captured by the Communist troops today. The Guomindang troops were forced to retreat and are now defending the line of Yugou, Dingji, and Baji. The Guomindang troops maintain a superior force, and morale is stable. There was also contact with the large concentration of Communist troops in Baiju, Dongtai, today.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 27th] Military news: Taking advantage of the ceasefire, a group of Communist troops invaded and occupied the three townships of Bo'ai, Longgang, and Zhenhu in Suqian yesterday, and then attempted to attack the county seat. The county's self-defense force and border defense force are strictly guarding and blocking the area from Qibao Township to Zhihekou on the west bank of the Grand Canal on the 27th.

[Our Jinan Dispatch, 26th] After the Communist troops re-invaded the outskirts of Jinan, the atmosphere has become tense. Many citizens return home early at night, and business in cinemas and entertainment venues has declined sharply. The news that the Communist troops are eager to expand their offensive has become the most concerning issue for the people.

### Wang Maogong to Depart for Huaiyin Soon

Traffic Between Dongtai City and Rural Areas Not Yet Restored

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 27th] Wang Maogong is scheduled to depart for Huaiyin on the first day of next month to continuously supervise political and pacification matters.

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 27th] News from Dongtai: The Communist troops in Dingxi and Cao Yan have not yet been cleared, and they disturb the area from time to time. Traffic between Dongtai City and the rural areas has not yet been restored, resulting in high prices and food shortages in the urban area, which urgently needs relief.

[Central News Agency, Huaiyin, 27th] The Headquarters of the Sixth Military Sub-district of the Central China Military Region of the Communist Army, due to the setbacks in the battles in northern Jiangsu, recently issued twelve secret emergency massacre orders: (1) Kill Kuomintang members, (2) Kill exiled families, (3) Kill landlords, (4) Kill intellectuals, (5) Kill those who secretly discuss national affairs, (6) Kill those who spread rumors and confuse the public, (7) Kill those who disobey conscription, (8) Kill those who evade military service, (9) Kill those who hide conscripts, and the remaining three are unknown.

### Communist Army's Retrograde Actions

Implementing Poisoning Policies in Shuyang; Banning the Hanging of Sun Yat-sen's Portraits in Various Institutions

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 27th] It is learned that: (1) The Communist troops in Shuyang are currently implementing poisoning policies in Shuyang County, distributing large quantities of opium poppy seeds and limiting people to collecting and planting them. (2) About 1,400 youths from Ganyu were conscripted by the Communist troops. (3) The Communist Party's Jiangsu-Anhui Border Region Government recently ordered the county governments under its jurisdiction to instruct all institutions, organizations, and schools to remove all portraits of Sun Yat-sen hanging within ten days and replace them with Mao Zedong's photographs.

### Over Ten Thousand Korean Residents in Northeast to be Repatriated Before the New Year

Soviet Personnel to Depart for Tianjin Early Next Month

[Special Dispatch from Shenyang by this Newspaper, Dated the 27th] The Northeast is about to repatriate 15,000 people from Jiangxi Province. All Korean southerners residing here without legitimate employment will be given priority. The task will be completed by American ships before the New Year. Relevant agencies are currently studying methods of concentration and repatriation. It is estimated that there are over one million Korean residents in the Northeast, with several hundred thousand in the regained areas of the National Army. Furthermore, there are two to three hundred German residents in the Northeast, a portion of whom will be repatriated home in the near future. Regarding the withdrawal of Soviet employees of the China Changchun Railway and some Soviet residents, it is reported that Soviet ships may arrive at the Tianjin port at the end of the month, and they are expected to depart for Tianjin early next month.

### Communist Troops Rampantly Disturb Various Locations in Northern Shaanxi; Self-Defense Forces Repeatedly Attacked; Looting of Livestock Everywhere; Villagers Fleeing in Droves

[Special Dispatch from Yaoxian by this Newspaper, Dated the 27th] Since Chairman Chiang issued another ceasefire order, the Nationalist Army has retreated from the blockhouse line stretching over 200 li in Xunyi, Chunhua, Yaoxian, Tongguan, Yijun, and other places in northern Shaanxi, replaced by local civilian self-defense forces. Taking advantage of the weak, Communist troops have launched continuous attacks from all sides since the 11th, causing extreme tension along the entire line. The self-defense forces are armed with red-tasseled spears, with a few dilapidated rifles that are practically useless against the Communist troops. Each county has four companies, and in the past two weeks, the Communist troops have eliminated three and a half companies in Tongguan, one and a half in Yijun, and half a company in Yaoxian. The county magistrates are constantly complaining, at a complete loss. On the 24th, this reporter traveled north from Sanyuan and witnessed Communist troops crossing the line and advancing to within eight li of Yaoxian city that evening. They were persuaded by the National Army defending the city to withdraw, but the tense situation has not eased. Every time the Communist troops capture a place, they take all the villagers' livestock, cotton, bedding, and grain, especially livestock, which they seem to need. However, they do not have the strength to capture any county seat. The villagers near the blockhouse line are currently in a state of unprecedented fear. The villagers in Jianzhuang Town, Yijun, have fled completely, leaving no one in sight for 90 li, because the area is filled with hills and ravines, making it impossible for villages to watch out for each other. The four small coal mines in Tongguan - Xinyu, Minsheng, Xiejian, and Tongtai - have all been raided by the Communist troops, who took away livestock and supplies, and more than twenty workers including the assistant manager of the Xiejian mine were also taken away, but were suddenly released on the morning of the 25th. The demarcation of the front line in northern Shaanxi was determined in March of the 26th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1937], with a ten-li buffer zone between the two armies. This buffer zone is now in the hands of the Communist troops, as observed by this reporter. Yesterday morning, more than twenty well-equipped Communist troops were discovered east of Huangbao Town, thirty li north of Yaoxian. In the Huanglong Mountain area east of the Yaoxian-Zhongdu highway, there are also 2,000 armed men who have occupied the area for several days. The self-defense forces armed with red-tasseled spears retreat in fear when they see them, and the National Army finds it difficult to advance or retreat, because while the National Army knows that these are Communist troops and not bandits, they can still use the ceasefire order as an excuse.

### National Commanders of Military Officer Corps Hold Meeting in Capital

[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Nanjing, Dated the 27th] The meeting of national commanders of military officer corps was held at the Central Training Corps at 8:00 AM on the 27th.

### National Federation of Commerce Asks for Several Points; Ministry of Finance Responds Separately; Business Tax Rate Can Be Considered for Revision

[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Nanjing, Dated the 27th] The National Federation of Commerce previously requested the Ministry of Finance and Treasury to (1) exempt income tax and profit tax for the 34th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1945], (2) abolish the excessive profit tax during the extraordinary period, (3) restore the pre-war business tax rate, and (4) reduce the stamp tax rate. It is now reported that the Ministry of Finance has approved or rejected the requests separately. The Excessive Profit Tax Law during the Extraordinary Period will be abolished at the end of this year. The Special Excessive Profit Tax Law will be implemented from January of the 36th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1947], with increased tax exemption and reduced tax rate. The business tax rate and stamp tax rate can be considered for revision in the future, but for the time being, they should still be levied according to the current tax law. As for the income and profit tax for the 34th year, it has already been exempted in the recovered areas. The current levy is based on the income and profit of various industries in the 34th year, and the income and profit tax payable in the 35th year is naturally not exempt according to the law. Also, it is learned that according to reports from local direct tax bureaus, the collection of income and profit tax is proceeding smoothly and can be fully collected before the end of the year.

### France Restricts Remittances by Overseas Chinese; China Raises Serious Objections Again

[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Nanjing, Dated the 27th] Since 1938, the French authorities in the French-owned islands of Madagascar, Reunion, and Tahiti have prohibited overseas Chinese from remitting money back to China. To date, this has reached 8 years. Our government has made repeated representations, but without results. After the end of the war, the French side again used the excuse of limited foreign exchange funds to limit overseas Chinese to remitting only 180 pounds per person per year, and the procedures are complicated, which is tantamount to not lifting the ban. As a result, relatives of overseas Chinese residing in the country have not been able to receive assistance. The 200,000 francs raised by overseas Chinese in Madagascar for the Double Tenth Festival to provide relief to domestic refugees last year also could not be remitted. Our government is extremely concerned about this and has once again raised serious objections to the French side.

Editorial

### The Start of Formal Constitution-Making Work

After intense debate, the National Assembly has passed the rules of procedure and is scheduled to hold its third meeting this morning, at which Chairman Chiang himself will present the draft constitution for discussion. The task of this National Assembly is to formulate a practical and feasible democratic constitution, so from today onwards, the National Assembly can be said to have entered the stage of formally starting constitution-making.

In the past few days, the proceedings of the National Assembly have been somewhat chaotic, causing the National Assembly to make slow progress. Democratic politics is inherently time-consuming, especially since we are just beginning to learn the process of democratic politics. When the General Assembly discusses issues, it is naturally inevitable that debates will continue, so in general, it is satisfactory. In particular, the generous speeches of some representatives were full of the spirit of democracy. In our country's political history, it can be regarded as the beginning of a new political style.

However, from today onwards, the National Assembly will begin discussing the draft constitution. Everyone knows that the constitution is the fundamental law of the country, related to the foundation of the country, and is a code that is jointly observed by the whole country. On the one hand, it must have lofty ideals, and on the other hand, it must take into account the country's real situation. The people of the country have their own propositions and aspirations for the ideals of the constitution. They also have their own understanding and opinions on the country's real situation. Therefore, it is inevitable that the people of the country will have a complex array of opinions on the ideals and essence of the constitution. If the National Assembly representatives cannot take a broad approach when discussing the draft constitution and want to debate endlessly on any issue, then the National Assembly session will inevitably be prolonged, and it is unknown when it will be able to complete its constitution-making task. What kind of impact will this have on politics? What kind of impression will the National Assembly make on the people? These are all worthy of the attention of the National Assembly representatives.

In the past few days, various parties have expressed their opinions on the draft constitution that is about to be submitted to the National Assembly for discussion. It is originally a gratifying phenomenon that the people of the country attach such importance to the fundamental law of the future, but the opinions provided by all parties are biased towards policy aspects. We believe that constitution-making is a major plan for the country for a hundred years. In addition to the fundamental national policies that have no time limit, which should be stipulated, other ordinary policies should not be stipulated in the constitution and can wait for the announcement of the future new government. According to the precedents of British and French democratic countries, any cabinet should announce its policy direction to the parliament after its establishment. Therefore, the fact that the draft constitution does not specify ordinary policies in detail cannot be regarded as a shortcoming of the draft constitution, because the constitution cannot make complicated provisions. This is one reason. There is no absolute good or absolute evil in political systems. There are both advantages and disadvantages to both the American-style presidential system and the British-style cabinet system. As long as it is suitable for our country's national conditions and is practical and easy to implement, it can be adopted. There is no need to adhere to a certain one, which will cause controversy. This is the second reason. Although the May Fifth Draft Constitution was formulated through long-term and meticulous discussion by the Legislative Yuan, it has been eight or nine years, and there are bound to be places that are not suitable for the times. Although the amendments passed by the Legislative Yuan cannot be said to be perfect, they are at least more progressive than the May Fifth Draft Constitution. National Assembly representatives must not have any prejudices against this. This is the third reason.

In short, we hope that the National Assembly representatives will not relax their efforts on the important key points of the constitution, but should seriously discuss and express their opinions as much as possible, so that the National Assembly is full of various opinions, and then the General Assembly will integrate and reconcile them to make wise choices. As for the clauses of the constitution, do not split hairs and ask for repeated revisions. These can allow experts in legislative technology to bear more responsibility for amendments. In this way, the constitution-making work of the National Assembly will surely have satisfactory results.

### Suzhou-Lili Ferry Boat Tragic Accident; Cylinder Explodes, Boat Blown into Two Sections; Only Eight Passengers Rescued, All Others Perish

[Dispatch from Wujiang by this Newspaper, Dated the 27th] The Suzhou-Lili ferry boat departed from Suzhou for Lili at noon on the 26th. At 5 PM, when it sailed to a certain lake three or four li or six li away from Lili, it suddenly caught fire. Soon after, the cylinder exploded, and the boat was blown into two sections. The fate of more than 20 passengers is unknown. It is reported that Zhou Jin, the director of the Lili Police Station, and Wang Lüchang, a local notable, were also killed.

[Dispatch from Suzhou by this Newspaper, Dated the 27th] The Rixin ferry boat of Lili Town, which belongs to Wujiang County, loaded 26 passengers and departed from Suzhou for Lili at about 1:00 PM on the 26th. At about 8:00 PM, when it was passing near Baiyang Bay, the engine room suddenly caught fire and exploded, and the entire boat sank in an instant. None of the passengers and cargo survived.

The total loss of cargo is also estimated to be over 10 million yuan. The driver has been arrested by the local police station for investigation to find out the truth about the accident.

### Suzhou's Industry and Commerce, Amidst Storms, Plans to Borrow Heavily from Banks to Escape the Clutches of Usury and Weather the End of the Year

[Our Suzhou Dispatch] Recently, all sectors of industry and commerce in this city have been showing signs of recession. Within and outside the city walls, the number of shops closing down and liquidating their assets has been increasing daily. The main reason is the influence of usury or rotating credit associations (biaohui), to the point where usury and biaohui have become the target of public criticism. Speakers are filled with pain and indignation, viewing them as a fatal wound to merchants. The government authorities have also taken note of this, and talk of cracking down on them has been repeatedly reported in the newspapers. However, to crack down on usury, there must first be low-interest loans. If there are low-interest loans, then merchants will not need to resort to biaohui. The two are different paths to the same goal and are inherently cyclical. Moreover, those engaged in usury have already felt the great pain of business failures due to the frequent closing of shops and are about to decline on their own. The trend of dissolving biaohui is quite prevalent, and the credit of biaohui has long been completely lost. Both can collapse on their own without the need for a crackdown. However, whether the economy of shops or individuals can obtain any benefits and be able to adjust their finances after usury and biaohui disappear is still a serious question. Now that the Western New Year is near, and the Lunar New Year is not far off, if a fundamental solution is not urgently sought, the trend of closing down and liquidating assets may spread uncontrollably, and the entire future of Suzhou's industry and commerce may suffer an irreversible setback. Therefore, for the sake of their own vital interests, the various trade associations in this city have planned to solemnly propose to the county chamber of commerce to request that the various banks in Suzhou lend large sums of money with adequate collateral to weather this stormy end of the year.

### Suzhou Higher Procuratorate Issues Arrest Warrant for Cultural Traitors Siming and Wenjian; Traitor Cheng Wanjun Transferred to Military Court for Trial

[Our Suzhou Dispatch] The Suzhou Higher Procuratorate recently issued an arrest warrant for four cultural traitors, including: (1) Wang Zhengwei, who served as the Deputy Dean and Director of the Research Office of the pseudo-Jiangsu Provincial Educational College and specialized in "Greater East Asia Lectures." (2) Cao Hua, who served as the Secretary of the pseudo-Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education and the Principal of the pseudo-Jiangsu Provincial Japanese Language School. (3) Wei Lihua, who served as the Director of Instruction at the pseudo-Japanese Language School. (4) Jiang Fengjia, who served as the Chief of Affairs at the pseudo-Japanese Language School. The above four traitors jointly carried out propaganda for the enemy and the puppets' "Greater East Asia Policy" and enslaved the youth in the occupied areas. After the victory, all fled without a trace. After the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education sent a letter to the Ministry of Justice, which forwarded it to the Suzhou Higher Procuratorate, the Higher Procuratorate investigated and found the facts to be true. After several attempts to summon them without success, it filed a public prosecution according to law and issued an arrest warrant.

### Wang Maogong Informs County Magistrates That Taxation and Administration Should Closely Cooperate

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch] Since the reorganization of tax collection agencies in various counties and cities of Jiangsu Province into tax collection offices on October 1st of this year, the collection situation in various counties and cities has been very smooth. Provincial Chairman Wang Maogong, considering that this is the beginning of the reorganization, and in order to closely coordinate taxation with local administration and promote balanced development, specially informed the county magistrates and mayors of three matters yesterday, earnestly urging them to work together harmoniously to facilitate the implementation of government orders. The gist of the original letter is recorded as follows: (1) The purpose of this reorganization of tax agencies is to strengthen collection work and unify the implementation of tax policies. The abundance or scarcity of tax revenue can affect local revenue, and the quality of management can affect the promotion of government affairs. The various county and city governments should still sincerely cooperate, work together, assist in overcoming difficulties, facilitate collection, and supervise nearby to achieve practical results. (2) The establishment of a personnel system is the foundation of all undertakings. Tax officials must be specialized in their skills, and their integrity is highly valued. The provincial government's reorganization of tax agencies is still based on a consistent policy of clarifying tax administration and rectifying tax customs. The appointment of personnel will absolutely exclude favoritism and plug loopholes. The appointment, removal, and promotion of tax personnel will be based on talent and moral character. The Department of Finance has formulated a system of selection, training, and evaluation for centralized management and strict implementation, in order to establish a tax personnel system as soon as possible and maintain long-term compliance. It is appropriate to avoid private recommendations. Since tax work is close to money, the suspicion of secret dealings should be avoided even more. Those who have specialized knowledge, integrity, and can be competent can be directly recommended to the provincial department for evaluation and distribution to various offices for appointment, in order to conform to the meaning of selecting people for public service and recommending talents to serve the country. (3) Tax agencies are responsible for increasing local revenue and providing support for expenses, and the tasks are heavy and complicated. It is essential to ensure that funding is not short and that personnel can work with peace of mind. In the future, all expenses of the tax collection office should be allocated on time in accordance with the regulations of the provincial department. If tax funding is insufficient, it will inevitably affect the collection work, and a shortage of revenue will make government expenses difficult. This principle is simple and easy to understand and need not be repeated. After the establishment of the tax collection office, whether the business can be developed smoothly is deeply related to the three matters mentioned above. It is hoped that careful consideration will be given and that the matters will be implemented earnestly in order to observe the results together.

### Anhui Province Makes Use of Slack Farming Season to Construct River Embankments in the Second Phase

[Our Hefei Dispatch, 27th] After the completion of the first phase of the Anhui Province river embankment project, the dikes are now effective, and there has been a bumper harvest along the river. The survey and design of the second phase of the project has now been completed. The provincial government believes that the current period is the slack farming season after the flooding, which is a good time to concentrate efforts to start construction.

### Wuhu Water Plant; Municipal Construction Committee Requests Unconditional Takeover

[Our Wuhu Dispatch] The Wuhu Water Plant was founded by the enemy during the occupation. It was later taken over and sold by the Enemy-Puppet Property Handling Bureau. The Wuhu Municipal Construction Committee believes that the water plant is of great importance to the lives of the citizens and is a public utility. It has resolved to purchase it by the committee and has appointed responsible persons for the purchase. However, the amount of money required is huge, and it is difficult to attract shares. Recently, it has been heard that the Ministry of the Interior has proposed that municipal organs have the right to request the unconditional transfer of such public utilities to local management. Therefore, in addition to consulting with the office of the Handling Bureau stationed in Anhui, the committee has also telegraphed the Anhui Provincial Government to request the Ministry of the Interior to allow for an unconditional takeover. Before the takeover, due to the insufficient number of water stations and the narrow streets and dense houses in the Wuhu urban area, in order to take into account fire hazards, it has been decided to conduct a general survey of all ponds and ditches and request the assistance of the Anhui Relief Branch to thoroughly dredge them through work-for-relief. Recently, the water plant has also increased the water fee for users from 1,000 yuan to 1,500 yuan per degree and the retail price at water stations from 160 yuan to 200 yuan per shi in order to maintain costs due to the rising price of coal.

### Byrnes Suddenly Changes Direction; The Four Powers Engage in Secret Diplomacy to Try to Break the Deadlock in Peace Treaty Negotiations

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 27th] The Four Powers, seeing that the meetings of the past few weeks have been in a stalemate, have changed direction today and adopted a strategy of "secret diplomacy." The four foreign ministers held secret talks in Secretary of State Byrnes's private reception room at the Astor Astoria Hotel, discussing the Italian peace treaty, especially the Trieste issue, excluding anyone but translators. This new direction in the negotiations between the Four Powers was initiated by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. Molotov, expressing pessimism over Byrnes's slow progress in the meeting, requested a private meeting with Byrnes to discuss openly and accelerate the work of the Foreign Ministers' meeting. Byrnes, who had previously insisted on "open diplomacy" at the Paris Peace Conference, accepted Molotov's suggestion because Byrnes had recently felt the great inconvenience of public discussion. Political observers believe that if the Soviet Union is willing to make concessions and the United Kingdom and the United States are willing to compromise with the Soviet Union on some points, then it is necessary to minimize publicity on these inevitable concessions that will facilitate the agreement. The opportunity for this secret talk came at Byrnes's luncheon for the three foreign ministers today. After coffee, the four foreign ministers secretly discussed the Trieste issue, especially the powers of the Governor of Trieste and the withdrawal of foreign troops. Observers speculate that no decisions have been made yet, but an optimistic atmosphere prevails. The four foreign ministers will resume secret talks at Byrnes's tea party tomorrow. Observers believe that this method of negotiation is open to criticism, but the important thing is the outcome. As long as this negotiation is consistent with the new principles of international law and morality, it does not matter if it is obtained through so-called outdated methods.

[Associated Press, New York, 26th] After Secretary of State Byrnes's direct talks with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov yesterday, he held secret talks with British Foreign Secretary Bevin today, seeking ways to reduce small countries' criticism of the veto power of large countries. The Soviet Union firmly insists that the Charter cannot be arbitrarily amended, and there is no concrete indication whether it is willing to make concessions. The purpose of these separate talks is to accelerate the work of the Foreign Ministers' meeting and is based on the United States' proposal to automatically amend the issue of the use of the veto power.

### The Soviet Union Adopts a Forceful Stance Towards Britain and the United States, Demanding Disclosure of Military Intelligence, Including Missiles and Atomic Weapons, Leading to Further Disputes in the UN Political and Security Committee

[Report from Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 27th (Broadcast): Discussions among delegates at the UN General Assembly regarding the issue of investigating the number of foreign troops are becoming increasingly heated, now reaching a critical stage for decision-making. In essence, the Soviet representative's lengthy argument plainly tells other nations: "If you want to know how many Soviet troops there are, you must first disclose how many atomic bombs you have." Discussions on this issue have lasted for five days without any resolution.

[United Press, Lake Success, 26th] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov directly questioned the United States and Britain today at the UN General Assembly's Political and Security Committee, asking whether they were prepared to immediately report all their peacetime atomic bombs and rocket weapons. This led to further disputes at the committee meeting. British representative Noel-Baker immediately launched a heated counterattack, stating that he was prepared to do so, just like Molotov and the Soviet Union. US representative Connally did not directly respond. After three hours of heated debate, the meeting adjourned until Wednesday. In addition, there is still no hope of breaking the deadlock on the issue of reporting troop deployments. Although the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain have agreed in principle on this matter, they disagree on the methods and locations for investigation. The Soviet Union demands investigation of foreign troops, bases, and military equipment, with "foreign" including former enemy countries. The United States wants to further investigate all troops, both foreign and domestic. Britain supports the US proposal but believes that a fact-finding mission should be dispatched by the Security Council, which the United States opposes. During today's meeting, Molotov also replied to Noel-Baker, stating that if his suggestion were to be expanded, it should include weapons, which must include atomic bombs, missiles, and all other weapons. How can troops fight without weapons? Investigating only the number of armed forces does not solve the problem, he said. Although Molotov still disagreed on the issue of investigating domestic troops, he argued that member nations could "report their armed forces and equipment within their territories so that the Security Council could discuss disarmament."

### Soviet Union Criticizes South Africa at Trusteeship Council Meeting

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 26th] Soviet representative Gromyko supported India today at the Trusteeship Council, criticizing South Africa's racial discrimination policy. He stated that the United Nations' duty lies in eliminating racial and religious discrimination, which is a great social calamity, and is prohibited in the Soviet Constitution. South African representative Smuts argued that the treatment of Indian expatriates in South Africa is better than that of black people, demonstrating that the discrimination case has a dual nature. Mr. Gromyko opposed submitting the case to the International Court of Justice.

### Dardanelles Strait Under Strict Guard, Turkey Deploys Heavy Troops Along the Soviet-Bulgarian Border, Rumors of Soviet Demand for the Cession of Key Ports from Turkey

The reporter recently received special permission to visit the Gallipoli Peninsula and Canakkale fortresses in the strait, where he saw heavy Turkish troops stationed along both sides of the strait, and modernized artillery batteries manned 24 hours a day.

[Agence France-Presse, Ankara, 27th] Foreign sources report that the Soviet Union has requested to use the Turkish port of Marmaris as a refueling station, but Turkish officials are unaware of this. At the same time, the US fleet is patrolling the Mediterranean and will soon visit Marmaris. Marmaris controls the vital sea lanes in the triangle formed by Crete, Rhodes, and Cyprus, and its strategic position is important.

### The United States Formally Opposes a Global Relief Organization
UNRRA Director Criticizes as Selfish and Self-Serving

[Central News Agency, New York, 26th] The US delegation to the UN formally opposed today the establishment of a global relief organization to replace UNRRA, but suggested that governments establish individual relief plans on their own after UNRRA stops distributing relief supplies. UNRRA Director LaGuardia immediately expressed opposition to the US delegation's decision. LaGuardia had previously condemned the United States for playing "food politics," and now called the US plan "selfish and self-serving."

### Anniversary of the Prime Minister of Nepal's Inauguration, Chinese Special Envoy Arrives in Nepalese Capital to Confer Honors, Nepal Has Paid Tribute to China Since the Qianlong Era, China Invariably Presents Medals to Each Prime Minister Upon Taking Office

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] According to diplomatic circles, November 29th marks the anniversary of the inauguration of Nepalese Prime Minister Padma Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana. The Chinese government has specially appointed Shen Zonglian, Director of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission's Office in Tibet, as a special envoy for the celebration, and will present the Nepalese Prime Minister with a Special Grand Cordon of the Precious Tripod Medal and the rank of Army General. Special Envoy Shen, along with Military Attaché Le Yaoxiang stationed in India and Consul Chen Yiyuan stationed in Calcutta, arrived in Kathmandu, the Nepalese capital, on the 26th, and the awarding ceremony is scheduled for the 28th, with participation in the Prime Minister's inauguration anniversary celebrations on the 29th. Nepal has had close relations with China in the past. According to the regulations of the 57th year of Qianlong (1792), Nepal paid tribute once every five years. The tribute in the 34th year of Guangxu (1908) was the last one during the late Qing Dynasty. Tribute was also paid in the early years of the Republic of China, but it was later interrupted for some reason. On the Chinese side, the Qing government sent an envoy to Nepal in the 31st year of Guangxu to confer the title of "Commander of Troops, Valiant King" on its Prime Minister (the King is the nominal head of state, with the Prime Minister in charge of national affairs). After the establishment of the Nationalist government in Nanjing, Zhang Ming, Consul General stationed in Calcutta, was dispatched in February of the 21st year (1932) to represent the government and present Prime Minister Bhim Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana with the First Class Precious Tripod Medal and the rank of Army General. When Juddha Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana succeeded as Prime Minister in the 21st year, the Chinese government dispatched Liang Changpei, Consul General stationed in Calcutta, to Nepal in the 23rd year to present him with the First Class Precious Tripod Medal and the rank of Army General. Juddha Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana retired on November 29th last year, and his nephew Padma Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana succeeded him as Prime Minister, with November 29th marking the first anniversary of his inauguration. Padma Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana was born on December 2, 1882. After graduating from a high school in the Nepalese capital, he served in the military. From 1909 to 1914, he was extensively involved in water and electricity construction projects. The important water and electricity and transportation construction projects in Nepal today were mostly operated by him at that time. During the First World War, he led Nepalese troops to guard the northwest border, repeatedly achieving military merits. He served as Commander of the Nepalese Army in 1929, and was promoted to Senior Commander in 1932. He succeeded his uncle as Prime Minister of Nepal in 1945.

### Roosevelt's Son Delivers Speech in the Soviet Union, Vehemently Anti-American and Pro-Soviet, Revealed by American Magazine "Newsweek"

[Report from Our Newspaper's Special Correspondent in New York, 27th] The "Newsweek" magazine published today an article on Elliot Roosevelt's vehement anti-American and pro-Soviet speech. It is said that this speech was delivered at a banquet in the American Embassy in the Soviet Union, attended by important figures from the United States, the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union's External Cultural Association. The contents of Elliot Roosevelt's speech are as follows: "The United States has no reason to interfere in the affairs of the Danube River basin. The US government must not be willing to go to war because it wants to establish an international regime on the Danube River. The same goes for the issue of the Black Sea Straits. It is clear that the Soviet Union should gain control of the Black Sea Straits, unless the United States agrees to internationalize the Panama Canal, and unless Britain also accepts the establishment of an internationalized regime in Suez and Gibraltar, the Soviet Union will never be so foolish as to agree to establish an international regime in the Black Sea Straits. The Soviet Union has never broken its promises, but the British and American sides have repeatedly violated the promises of Tehran, Yalta, and Potsdam. In order to deal with the expansionist policies of Britain and the United States, the Soviet Union should create friendly regimes in neighboring countries." Elliot then asked, "Can anyone point out a fact showing that the United States has made further efforts for peace?" An American reporter replied that the United States is doing its best to strengthen the United Nations. Elliot had anticipated this response and immediately added, "The reason why Western countries support the United Nations is entirely for selfish and imperialist goals."

Prime Minister Nokrashy has returned from London with proposals for treaty revision negotiations, and Parliament was originally scheduled to begin debating them tonight. At the same time, demonstrations, mainly led by students, continued today, and the authorities' warnings to take strict measures have not been effective.

### Lewis and Coal Mine Owners Reportedly Begin Secret Negotiations, Government Plans to Use Pipelines to Transport Natural Coal Gas

[Reuters, Washington, 26th] Reliable sources said today: Lewis, the leader of 400,000 coal miners, has begun secret negotiations with mine owners. This news has raised a glimmer of hope for resolving the coal mine strike. An internal spokesperson said: "Secret negotiations may be underway, but the bureau is not in a position to make a formal statement. We welcome any action that avoids disputes." Interior Secretary Krug is actively studying a plan to use wartime oil pipelines to transport natural coal gas from Texas to coal-using areas. If this plan is realized, it will be a permanent and dangerous competition for the bituminous coal industry. Deputy Secretary of State Acheson told reporters today that in addition to the complete prohibition of coal exports, the reduction of inland railway traffic due to the coal mine strike will also cause the transportation of food to be suspended. It is heard that steel production in some places has been reduced to 35% of normal production, and railway traffic may be further discounted. If the coal strike continues to drag on, one million more people will inevitably lose their jobs. It is heard that the mine owners have also contacted Veterans Affairs Director Steelman to restore negotiations between the mine owners and the union; however, President Truman is still taking a firm stance towards Lewis.

### The Lack of Coal in American Heavy Industry is Gradually Becoming Paralyzing

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 26th] John L. Lewis, former chairman of the United Mine Workers of America, is keeping his mouth shut about the miners' strike and is keeping silent. People call him a "living mute." However, according to reliable sources: the US government and industrial leaders are now trying to find a compromise solution to break the deadlock. American heavy industry is now gradually falling into a state of paralysis due to the shortage of coal. One million workers may be out of work by next week. The federal court is now scheduled to try Lewis tomorrow; but even if the government wins, it may not be able to get the miners back to work. Although the government authorities want to expedite the trial of Lewis, it may still take some time, or even weeks, to complete. If so, the coal mines will be returned to their original owners.

### The Soviet Union is Conducting Secret Activities in Sukhumi on the Black Sea Coast, Rumors That an Atomic Factory is Being Built There

[United Press, Washington, 26th] Scripps-Howard newspaper columnist Simons stated: Diplomats believe that the Soviet Union's plan to build its own atomic energy factory has now reached a mature stage. However, the general public does not believe the rumor circulating in Istanbul that such a factory is currently being built near Sukhumi on the Black Sea. Mr. Simons stated: "Some secret activities may be underway there, but Sukhumi is located in Georgia, south of the Caucasus, and its position is too exposed to be a vital atomic industrial center."

### The Shuchai Steamer's Maiden Voyage to Kou'an: Grounded in an Accident in Heavy Fog; All Crew Members, Including Chen Ke, are Safe; Salvage is Under Discussion

"This newspaper reports" The Maotai Steamer of the Maoli Shipping Company, had an accident mid-voyage on its maiden voyage to Kou'an. Fortunately, the crew and passengers are safe. The crew returned to Shanghai yesterday on the Da Steamer. The details of the incident are recorded as follows: The Maotai Steamer was originally owned by the Daxin Shipping Company, with a tonnage of over 200 tons. Two months ago, Daxin Company sold it to Maoli Company, renamed it Maotai, and repaired it. It sailed the eastern Zhejiang route twice. On the 19th of this month, it changed its route to Kou'an. That morning, it set sail from Shanghai. The captain was Xu Fangyu. It went west out of Wusongkou, going up the river. After exiting the port, the captain handed over the helm to pilot Zheng Defu. As evening approached, the weather was not good, and the river surface gradually became foggy, but not thickly, using the buoy lighthouses as navigation targets. It continued to advance. At 1:20 AM that night, the lighthouse on the Jin Gang river surface in Duanshan was unclear. In addition to the heavy fog, the pilot lost the target and was unfamiliar with the navigation route, causing it to run aground on a shoal. The shipowner, upon learning of the accident, immediately ordered the ship to reverse twice, but it could not get out of danger. The ship was getting stuck deeper and deeper, and the hull tilted to the left, with river water entering. The crew and passengers immediately telegraphed a report. Soon, the Lianying Office dispatched the Beiyuan Steamer to rescue, and the cargo inside the ship was unloaded, totaling about 50 tons, mostly cigarettes, totaling more than 160 boxes. Two-thirds of the goods had been soaked in water. The crew and passengers then took the Chuyuan Steamer to Tianshenggang. Some of the passengers had their tickets refunded by the company and changed steamers themselves, and some were sent to Kou'an by the Chuyuan Steamer. The 96 crew members returned to Shanghai on the Da Steamer, arriving in Shanghai at 2:00 PM yesterday. The captain immediately reported to the company. The Chief Mate, Chief Engineer, and Business Director will determine whether to proceed with salvage. According to Guo Yuan, the manager of the company, the ship has a large hull, so it is currently under discussion. A proper solution will also be determined for the crew. The losses of the cargo will be handled by the Lianying Office.

Death of a Steward on the Hunan Steamer

Perhaps it was anchored outside the port, waiting for inspection by the Seaport Quarantine Office, so it will enter the port today. The British Steamer, Lanla, left Shanghai for Korea the day before yesterday and is expected to return to Shanghai at the beginning of next month, carrying British nationals in Shanghai. It is also reported that more than 150 people from our country's Naval Academy will also take the ship to England for liaison.

### Ministry of Finance Responds to the City Council on Four Financial and Economic Measures

The municipal council suggested that the central government take various financial and economic measures. The Ministry of Finance has separately reviewed and replied to the matter. The relevant documents arrived at the council yesterday. The main points are recorded separately below: (1) Regarding the consolidation of banking business: (A) Recently, in order to encourage commercial firms to invest in production enterprises, the Central Bank supervised commercial firms to organize syndicates. For loans to small and medium-sized factories and export trade, they may apply to the Central Bank for re-mortgage or rediscount. Whether the fixed rate of ordinary deposit reserve should be reduced in Shanghai is under consideration. However, its reserve has been revised to be reduced to one-tenth, which will be returned to facilitate flexibility and payment. (B) The Ministry of Water Resources manages the bank, mainly to minimize or reduce highly coercive governance methods, and use economic methods to guide its strength, in order to seek the proper development of banking business.

(2) Regarding the adjustment of industrial funds: (A) Long-term low-interest loans for increasing production and assisting construction are the central task of the country. It has been actively handled for thousands of years, and it has achieved considerable results. (B) Factory loans are mortgaged with raw materials and finished products. The needs of the factory and the regulations of the bank can be taken into account. (C) Various agricultural loans (including water conservancy loans) are being implemented separately by the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China, according to the scheduled plan. (D) National loan procedures have also been urged to be simplified as much as possible. (E) The advantages and disadvantages of in-kind loans are mixed, and the continuation is also worthy of research. The Four Joint Offices are currently conducting in-depth research. (F) Regarding the organization of the Reconstruction Investment Company, the Shanghai industrial and commercial representatives made this suggestion when they came to Beijing to petition last time. After verification, the principle is feasible. (3) Regarding the development of international trade: (A) Whether the import and export chain system is appropriate under the current foreign exchange management method is worthy of research. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has gathered various agencies to discuss it, and believes that there are many concerns. 1. Importers may not also engage in exports, which violates the original purpose of the chain. 2. If only the amount is chained, it is still questionable whether this can limit imports. 3. If the total categories of goods are linked, most of what our country needs are machinery, cotton, and rice, while what should be encouraged to export are tea, tung oil, pig bristles, and agricultural products. There are concerns about forcing cotton exports, and it should be further considered. (B) Regarding the barter trade system, the Central Trust Bureau currently has a barter trade office, and the Ministry has sent a letter to inquire about it, and will reply later. (C) Regarding overseas markets, the husband is currently focusing on expanding. (D) The current commodity tax still follows the established rules of the general tax. Goods sold abroad can be refunded or exempted from tax, which has no impact on the development of international trade. (4) Regarding revitalizing the city's finances: (A) General land finance has been assigned to the Agricultural Bank of China. (B) The draft banking law stipulates that banks should dispose of real estate they own within one year. This real estate is received due to debt repayment. If it is not disposed of for a long time, it will make the bank's funds stagnant and lose the effect of flexible use, and one year is not short. (C) Using real estate as collateral to banks was originally a bad habit of the Shanghai banking industry. Under the current situation, it should be corrected to avoid fueling land speculation.

The British industry has a long history, and its industry and commerce are extremely developed. The intellectual level of workers is particularly advanced, which is worthy of our imitation. China and the United Kingdom should unite and cooperate. China is moving towards a democratic and free road and is striving to engage in industrial construction. Therefore, we hope that China and the United Kingdom can closely link up to promote world labor cooperation and human peace. Finally, I hope that the British industrial community can organize visiting groups to China from time to time, so that we can study each other, and I hope that Mr. Thornton will report on the situation of Chinese industry after returning to the UK and provide assistance from time to time. After the speech, Mr. Thornton stood up to give a reply, first expressing his gratitude for the warm hospitality, and then said that the British industrial community is very interested in the future development of Chinese industry, and has a very friendly feeling towards the Chinese labor community. China and the United Kingdom will also fight together, and now we should strive for cooperation and fight together for democracy and freedom, in order to promote the realization of world peace and human equality. The British trade union organization has a history of more than 100 years, and is very willing to sincerely assist the Chinese industrial community. I deeply hope that the Chinese trade union can become a responsible organization that seeks welfare for workers and strives to improve the lives of workers. China is in a very difficult period, and not only hopes that industrial problems can be resolved, but also hopes that political problems can be resolved as soon as possible. The banquet ended happily at about 9 o'clock.

### Taiwan Sugar's Inventory is Still Abundant; Factory Restoration is Progressing Rapidly

Shen Zhennan Talks About His Trip to Taiwan After Returning to Shanghai

Shen Zhennan, General Manager of Taiwan Sugar Corporation, went to Taiwan on September 11 to inspect sugarcane planting and factory restoration. He flew back to Shanghai from Taiwan the day before yesterday afternoon at 2 o'clock. This morning, he will go to the capital to report to the Assets Committee on the progress of this trip and make some requests. After returning to Shanghai, he will stay for more than a week and will have to go to Taiwan again to arrange everything. According to Shen's conditions, the original plan of the company was to plant 90,000 Jia of sugarcane (16 mu per Jia). It started in July and has now completed 80%. Half of it is in Tainan, followed by Kaohsiung, and then Taichung. It is expected that the harvest in the following year can produce 300,000 tons of sugar. Regarding the sugarcane planting loans that assist sugarcane farmers, NT$600 million has been loaned out to date, stipulating NT$10,000 per Jia, with an interest rate of 7%, and will be fully recovered by the end of next year when the sugarcane is harvested. In order to encourage the interest of sugarcane farmers, the original sugarcane farmer's sugar sharing method was changed to settle the payment according to the sugar price at that time, with the farmers getting 48% and the company getting 52%. The sugar price is guaranteed at NT$25 per catty. If it rises sharply, it will be settled at the market price. As for factory restoration, the progress is rapid. If hardware and equipment can be transported quickly, then as many as 30 factories can be restored by the end of next year. The factory that will start work in January next year can reach 12, first using the sugarcane planted last year to make sugar. Unfortunately, this raw material was planted the year before under the direction of the Japanese, so the quality is not good. Fortunately, the current sugar reserves are abundant, which can be connected with the production in the following year, so there will be no shortage. As for the 4,000 Japanese technicians originally in the factories, 3,000 were sent away in April, and 900 more were recently sent back. 100 people were retained. Fortunately, our country's technicians have begun to be transferred and can be sent to serve. In the future, it will be sufficient and there will be no problem. Shen also said: The general living situation in Taiwan Province is not yet stable.

### Otters that are Amphibious; Looks Like a Snake, Fox, and Mouse; Captured Alive in Western Zhejiang and Brought to Shanghai

"This newspaper reports" The people of Shanghai are truly fortunate. We just saw Miss Panda, and now we have the opportunity to appreciate the Otter Prince. However, the former has a grand momentum and is preparing to reciprocate the United States, while the latter was caught by a small farmer in a mountain village and is preparing to sell it at a good price. Fortunately, the director of Hengjingchang Fur Shop at No. 332 Henan Middle Road has a kind heart and kept it, and will transfer it to the city's zoo for display.

"Otter skin" is the pride of precious fur coats, and the "Otter Prince" is a delicate guest among animals. Its honor can be compared to many things, like a snake, a mouse, and a fox. To be specific, when it moves, it is as agile as a snake, when it forages, it is like a mouse, and when it shrugs its shoulders and walks wide, it is like a fox again. When it is full and resting, it refuses to be still, twisting its waist and playing with its tail, like a naughty monkey. Its toes are connected, indicating that it is also good at swimming.

The hometown of this prince is in Anji, western Zhejiang. There, the mountains and forests are dense, and the ponds are crisscrossed. When it was discovered by the villagers, it was practicing diving with its mother. In the dark night, the villagers suspected that "water ghosts" were causing trouble, so they launched a surprise attack. Its mother sacrificed under the ruthless knife, but it became a prisoner in the net. When it was first captured and brought to Shanghai, it only ate milk, but now it can gobble up small fish. It is said that it is particularly cunning and amphibious. For many years, it is still the first time it has been captured alive. It is now on display in Hengjingchang Fur Shop. For the sake of curiosity, ladies who have never seen the true face of an otter are worth visiting and appreciating. (Picture shows the true face of the otter on display)

### Fight Triggered Under the Red Light; Eleven Policemen and Ticket Sellers Injured; Three Bus Lines Once Suspended

"This newspaper reports" At 6:30 PM last night, a temporary bus (Route No. 7) of the Municipal Bureau of Public Works was driving from the Bund to the intersection of Zhongzheng East Road and Henan Road. Because it ran a red light, the traffic police ordered it to stop and questioned the driver. However, the driver Xu Shunshi believed that the police were deliberately making trouble. Both sides held their own opinions and a dispute occurred. Finally, the traffic police took the driver to the Huangpu Police Station. At that time, the buses of various routes that came later learned about the previous situation and were indignant. They stopped running one after another, totaling more than 30 vehicles. All the drivers and ticket sellers, more than 100 people, gathered in front of the police station and demanded the immediate release of the driver. The situation was tense for a while, and the traffic there was also blocked. At about 8 o'clock, when traffic police officers Li Guangyu, No. 5916, and Yan Pengfei, No. 979, were leaving the station, they were discovered by the drivers and ticket sellers who gathered in the square and were beaten severely. When some police officers in the police station saw this situation, they also felt unfair, so a big fight broke out between the two sides. After Du, the chief of the branch, learned about it, he immediately sent police to put it down. However, in the conflict, police officers Li Guangyu, Yan Pengfei, and ticket sellers Ji Youguan, Sun Dingkun, Zhu Genquan, Jin Qihua, Gao Chongliang, Xu Renshi, Zhou Asan, Hu Wenlong, and Xu Sisheng were injured. Soon, the police station sent the injured to the police hospital and Renji Hospital for treatment. At this point, the situation had become serious. Fortunately, the preparatory office of the Public Bus Company of the Public Works Bureau also heard the news and quickly sent the preparatory director Wu Zhuozhi to investigate. On the one hand, he ordered the drivers and ticket sellers to resume work first, and on the other hand, he negotiated with the police station. It was not until 9:30 PM that the police station agreed to release the driver, and the storm was resolved. Li Guangyu, Yan Pengfei, Ji Youguan, and Sun Dingkun were seriously injured and hospitalized for treatment. The rest were bandaged and discharged from the hospital.

### Secretary-General of the Korean Delegation Receives Reporters to Report on the Current Situation in Korea, Appeals for Sino-Korean Friendship, and Asks for Understanding of the Actions of a Few Bad Elements

"This newspaper reports" Kim Eun-chung, Secretary-General of the Korean Delegation, recently came to China to be responsible for Sino-Korean liaison matters. He recently made a trip to Beijing. After returning to Shanghai, he received the city's press corps at 2:00 p.m. yesterday to report on the current situation in Korea and emphasized the importance of friendly Sino-Korean relations. Mr. Kim first stated the aspects of Korean history, geography, culture, religion, and customs that are related to China. Then, in terms of economics, education, and politics, he reported on the current situation in Korea, stating: (1) The economic situation is quite chaotic because, after the Yalta Conference agreement, the 38th parallel became the dividing line, and materials between the North and South are separated. It is said that some people cannot solve their livelihood problems, and riots have occurred. Although there have also been bloody incidents in the South, the general situation is better. The U.S. military is using materials and grain to provide relief, but the people still oppose trusteeship and hope for independence. (2) In education, since Japan's surrender, all enslaving education has been completely eliminated. Since December of last year, pure culture has been fully restored. At present, young Koreans do not understand Chinese because they have lived under Japanese rule for too long, but it is estimated that more than 80% of the 27 million people can speak Chinese. The most popular writing in the country is also a combination of Chinese and Korean, that is, part Chinese and part Korean. The current education system is also similar to that of China. More than 98% of schools have Chinese courses, and all teachers have a good understanding and knowledge of China and teach voluntarily. (3) The political problem is not as complicated as imagined. Although there are many political parties in the country, they can all understand that seeking the country's independence is the top priority. The four major parties in the South, the Independence Party, the Democratic Party, the People's Party, and the Communist Party, have recently united to form a joint party headquarters. The "Political Education and Economic Equalization System" advocated by the Independence Party has been unanimously approved by the four parties and has implemented land redistribution. The original People's Committee in the North has been reorganized into the New People's Party and has also implemented land redistribution. What is not used is that the South implements unconditional recovery. Recently, both the North and South have begun to connect closely to seek the country's independence and freedom together.

Finally, Mr. Kim repeatedly emphasized that China and Korea should work closely together. He said that China and Korea are like childhood friends. The two countries only have related interests and no conflicting interests. However, due to Japan's long-term occupation in the past, a few bad people have forgotten their roots over time and committed crimes in China, causing a bad impression. Since the end of the war, China has treated Korean and Japanese expatriates and prisoners of war the same, resulting in many honest people being deported back to their countries and falling into difficulties. Recently, there have been reports of anti-Chinese sentiment in Korea, which has led to retaliatory actions against Korean expatriates in some parts of China. This situation has a negative impact on Sino-Korean relations. It is hoped that everyone will recognize the importance of friendly Sino-Korean relations. The behavior of a few bad people cannot represent the entire population. The real Koreans are willing to be friends with China. At the same time, it is hoped that the Chinese government will distinguish between good and bad Korean expatriates and treat them differently. Korea has already occupied the right timing, and the Soviet Union has occupied the geographical advantage. China must strive for harmony among the people. Recently, the Korean delegation has drafted concrete measures to improve Sino-Korean relations and suggested to the Chinese government: (1) Provide loans to more than 2 million Korean expatriate farmers in Northeast China. (2) Relax the standards for Korean expatriate property. (3) Shorten the war criminal trial period. (4) Restore Sino-Korean transportation and trade, etc. In addition, Korean veterans have established the Sino-Korean Friendship Association in Seoul to protect overseas Chinese.

### Shanghai Alumni of the Central Training Corps Organize a Friendship Association

### The Poorer the Family, the More Children They Have; Talking to Them About Birth Control is Like Playing the Lute to a Cow; Health Pharmaceutical Association Plans to Restore Guidance Work

"This newspaper reports" The China Health Pharmaceutical Association on Chi Bang Road in this city plans to restore the birth control guidance center in the near future to seek welfare for women who have given birth too many times or whose physical strength is not up to par. Before the war, there was the establishment of the "Shanghai Birth Control Research Society" in the medical and pharmaceutical circles of this city. During the war, it was virtually suspended due to the dispersal of members.

According to Dr. Huang Huaibei, director of the Health Pharmaceutical Association, it is almost impossible to universally implement birth control in China, because even in progressive countries in Europe and the United States, although many people advocate it, they should not practice birth control. As for the situation in China, the people have lower knowledge, and often the poorer the family, the more children they have. Talking to them about birth control is like "playing the lute to a cow." Furthermore, the method of birth control is nothing more than the use of tools. Those used by men are quite inconvenient for physiology, while those used by women are expensive and cannot be afforded by poor families. Therefore, although the association plans to restore the birth control guidance center, there is no far-reaching promotion plan, but only to provide medical guidance for those who have given birth too much or whose physical strength is weak.

In addition, the China Health Pharmaceutical Association has now piloted the "News Public Health Experimental Zone." In addition to handling the actual outpatient work of medical treatment, it also focuses on preventive work such as health education, family visits, and physical examinations. Its blood transfusion service department is the only organization in this city. There are currently 72 specially contracted blood donors who regularly supply blood to 12 hospitals in Shanghai. Recently, the association will also hold an advanced nurse training class, and free physical examinations for healthy children are held every Wednesday afternoon.

### Opera "Meng Jiangnu" to be Performed in Shanghai Next Month by the China Musical Theater; Yesterday, the Press Corps was Invited to Report; China Travel Service Establishes Overseas Group

The Shanghai Branch of China Travel Service has opened an overseas group at 50 Ningbo Road, Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank, starting from the 25th of this month to facilitate overseas travelers. It specializes in selling overseas ship and plane tickets, handling overseas travel procedures, and selling traveler's checks.

"This newspaper reports" The China Musical Theater, sponsored by Madame Chiang, specially invited the city's press corps at 12:00 p.m. yesterday to the Shanghai First Reception Center of the Lizhi Society at 2004 West Nanjing Road because it will be performing in Shanghai soon. First, Huang Renlin, the general secretary of the Lizhi Society, reported on the grand occasion of the troupe's public performance in Nanjing earlier this month and said that the chairman and his wife greatly praised it. When "Meng Jiangnu" was performed, Chairman Chiang watched the play twice; and "Bo Guang Qin Xin" was performed once, for a total of three times. Madame Chiang, during the rehearsal of the two plays, had already hired Mr. and Mrs. Heishuai, Tiecheng, Song Ziwen, Chen Cheng and other five people as consultants, and followed Madame Chiang's request to hire Dr. Mei Lanfang as a consultant. Huang met with Dr. Mei yesterday, and Mei readily agreed.

Then, Deng Shiping, Madame Chiang's representative and the current general manager of the troupe, introduced the troupe's composer and director, Aifu Xia Lomuf, saying that Mr. Aifu (the name by which people in the country referred to Aifu Xia Lomuf) grew up in Siberia in his childhood. Because the natural geography is close to the Chinese border, he has loved Chinese music since he was a child and is determined to explore its essence. His parents forced him to study medicine, but Mr. Aifu was willing to be a traitor to his family and went to the Swiss Conservatory of Music for further study. He then came to China and has been painstakingly studying the essence of Chinese medicine for 30 years. His works that have been staged include "Meng Jiangnu", "Bo Guang Qin Xin", "Ancient Temple Turtle Dream", and "Five Planets". His unfinished works include "Wife Concubine" and "Phoenix".

Aifu Xia Lomuf then gave a speech, saying that in his 30 years of musical work, he only knew that expressing emotions was the only goal. However, after admitting that his wife sponsored him this time, he realized his own mission, excellent tradition, and extremely high attainments. With forbearance and strategy, my goal is to use the essence of Chinese national music through Western instruments to give full play to it.

The China Musical Theater is scheduled to perform "Meng Jiangnu" at the Nanjing Great Theater on December 5, 6, 7, and 8. The ticket prices are 50,000 yuan (honorary medical ticket), 20,000 yuan, and 10,000 yuan. The play "Meng Jiangnu" was performed in "Guangxin" and was well received by the general public. After this public performance, it will go to the United States as soon as there is an opportunity to raise funds for the relief of refugee children.

### City Government Symphony Orchestra to Perform Program Today

### Police Chief Steals Enemy Property; Chen Juping and Others to be Re-Examined Yesterday

"This newspaper reports" Chen Xueping, director of the Zhabei Police Sub-bureau, was suspected of concealing and selling enemy property, 550 dozen enameled washbasins, and 340 iron bars from the Yatie Factory in October last year. At the same time, Huang Jianxiong, administrative section chief, employees Fang Xifan and Zhu Shuyuan, and businessman Shuang Dechang of the sub-bureau were involved. The local court sentenced Chen Xueping to seven years in prison, acquitted Shuang Dechang, and sentenced Fang and Zhu to six months in prison. Chen and others were dissatisfied with the judgment and filed an appeal. After the Chamber of Commerce reviewed the case, Chen Xueping and others denied the charges against them. The judge believed that further investigation was necessary, and Shuang Dechang, who was acquitted in the original judgment, was also considered to have significant suspicions. The three guarantors of the Jiaogu Shop were required to provide three guarantees or 50 million yuan in cash, but since there was neither shop guarantee nor cash, the case was temporarily detained and rescheduled for retrial.

### The Local Court Clarifies the Dispute Over House Donations: If There Are Provisions in the Lease, They Should Be Bound By It, But This Agreement Has No Effect Against Tax Authorities

[This newspaper reports] Since the implementation of the new method of collecting house donations in this city, landlords and tenants have immediately started disputes. Because the current house donation collection method is based on the actual rent of the house, 20% of the rent is borne by the landlord, and the household is responsible for paying it on behalf of the landlord first, and then using it to offset the rent. However, the landlord and the household often stipulate in the lease that all donations and taxes shall be paid by the tenant and have nothing to do with the landlord, so that the household often refuses to pay after paying the donation, and the dispute arises from this. The Finance Bureau believed that this matter involved legal issues and had sent a letter to the Shanghai Local Court for a clear explanation. It is reported that the Local Court has replied to the Finance Bureau, roughly requesting: If the lessor and the lessee stipulate in the lease that "all donations and taxes shall be paid by the lessee and have nothing to do with the lessor", both parties shall be bound by it, but this kind of special agreement has no effect against the tax authorities.

### Wu Yunzhai Sentenced to Two and a Half Years; Zhang Xitong and Zhang Liansheng Sentenced at the Same Time

Wu Yunzhai, chairman of the pseudo-Xinwen Bao, had been tried by the High Court before, and yesterday was the date of sentencing. At 9:00 a.m., the gallery was crowded with relatives and friends of the defendant's family, and Mr. and Mrs. Qian Xin-zhi also arrived on time to listen. At 9:30, Liu Yugui, the president of the High Court, and the two judges, Cao and Qiu, ascended the court. The defendant was escorted by bailiffs, wearing a dark blue robe, a black velvet hat, and gold-rimmed glasses. He looked dejected. After asking his age and origin, President Liu stood up and read the main text of the judgment: "Wu Yunzhai, conspiring with the enemy and conspiring to rebel against the country, is sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment and deprived of his civil rights for two years. All property shall be confiscated except for the necessary living expenses for the family." He continued: "The defendant's sentence of two years and six months is a lenient sentence, because the defendant was found to have assisted in the war of resistance, sheltered underground work, and has been proven by Jiang Bocheng, Du Yuesheng, and Qian Xin-zhi. However, the pseudo-Xinwen Bao was sponsored by the enemy's naval reporting department. In legal terms, the defendant is sentenced according to the crime he deserves." After hearing the sentence, Wu repeatedly said that he was not satisfied and said that he would apply for a retrial. Then he requested the court to allow him to meet with his family, and the request was granted. When the defendant was talking with his family, Qian Xin-zhi also went to reminisce with him for about four minutes, and then he was escorted back by the bailiffs. The following were also sentenced at the same time: (1) Zhang Lou-tong, sentenced to three years of imprisonment and deprived of his civil rights for three years. (2) Zhang Liansheng, sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment and deprived of his civil rights for two years. The property of the above two traitors shall be confiscated according to law.

### Sun Chunsheng Vehemently Denies Fundraising and Dedicating Aircraft by Relying on Enemy Power

[This newspaper reports] Sun Chunsheng, a real estate tycoon, served as the executive director and secretary-general of the pseudo-Shanghai Real Estate Association and the Chinese manager of the Enemy Trust Real Estate Co., Ltd. during the period when Shanghai was occupied by the enemy. He was suspected of relying on enemy power to solicit donations of 225,000 yuan in pseudo-currency from various colleagues as "aircraft dedication". After the victory, Sun was arrested in Shanghai by the Songhu Garrison Headquarters under the order of the Ministry of National Defense and sent to the High Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution. The case was heard in the High Court yesterday afternoon. Sun confessed that he was 48 years old, from Yuyao, Zhejiang, and lived at 180 Dunxin Road. In the early years of the Republic of China, he worked in the English Commercial Guang Company. Because of a house dispute, he met Japanese lawyer Okamoto Otsu. In the 19th year of the Republic of China, he transferred from Ye Guang Company to Trust Real Estate Co., Ltd., where Okamoto Otsu was the general manager and director. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, he repeatedly wanted to resign, but he was threatened by the enemy constitution and never succeeded. The scope of "Trust Exchange" was very small, only collecting rent for customers, etc., and there was nothing that would harm the people of the country. He resigned in the 31st year of the Republic of China. The pseudo-Real Estate Association was formed in July of the 32nd year of the Republic of China under the threat of the pseudo-Economic Bureau. At that time, more than 100 colleagues participated, and the defendant was elected as the executive director by their vote. Then the directors and supervisors appointed him as the secretary-general, and the chairman was Zhu Boquan. In March of the 33rd year of the Republic of China, a "Shanghai Citizens' Aircraft Dedication Campaign Committee letter and an invitation letter from the "Mayor" Chen Gongbo were sent to the association. The board of directors and supervisors decided that it was appropriate not to participate, and Chen Gongbo's banquet was not attended. It is even more unheard of to solicit donations of 225,000 yuan for the dedication of aircraft. The court ordered that the case still needs to be investigated and rescheduled for retrial, and the defendant was sent back to prison.

### Trial of Pan Lizhi, a German Jew

Pan Lizhi, a German Jew, was accused of colluding with the enemy Japan. In the 29th year of the Republic of China, the enemy controlled the administrative power of the Shanghai Public Concession. Fearing that the number of votes of overseas Chinese was insufficient, Pan Lizhi wanted to take the opportunity to show his loyalty and ran around for the enemy Japan, wooing German Jewish refugees to join the vote. In the 31st year, the Pacific War broke out, and the enemy entered the concession. Pan Lizhi was re-appointed by the enemy navy to set up an agency at the Cathay Hotel. Under the command of the enemy Zhitian, he secretly reviewed relevant British documents and broadcast in German every day to promote for the enemy. He also strongly supported the pro-Japanese Shanghai Jewish newspaper and prevented the publication of other newspapers that were beneficial to our country. After the victory, Changju detained him and sent him to the High Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution. When the defendant was tried in the High Court yesterday, he denied that he had worked as an intelligence officer in the enemy's special agency, and he did not participate in the election activities of the Public Concession at that time, saying that he was the manager of the European Refugee Assistance International Committee and was in charge of the association affairs in Shanghai. However, Mrs. Annes came to court and testified that the defendant did indeed work as an intelligence officer at the enemy Naval Marine Corps Zhitian, and the court ordered a retrial at a later date.

### Police Department Even Rewards 100,000 Yuan to Claim the Dismembered Corpse

At 10:00 a.m. on the 25th of this month, dismembered corpses were found separately on the riverside under Yokohama Bridge and on the wasteland near Wuhua Road and Linping Road.

### Wu Suiren, Who Used Public Funds to Release Discount Interest, Was Taken into Custody Yesterday

(This newspaper reports) Wu Suiren, a clerk in the accounting section of the General Affairs Office, used his position to embezzle 2.7 billion yuan of the General Affairs Office's September funds for lending. After the authorities discovered this case on October 28, Wu expressed his repentance and returned all 2.7 billion yuan of public funds, including the 14.6 million yuan in interest. Although the General Affairs Office did not suffer any losses, Wu Suiren's embezzlement of public funds violated criminal law. Therefore, Huo Baoshu, director of the General Affairs Office, sent the entire case to the Local Procuratorate on the 16th of this month for handling in accordance with the law. The prosecutor in charge of the Local Procuratorate issued a detention warrant yesterday morning and sent bailiffs to Wu Suiren's residence at 2 Ruifengli, East Jiaxing Road, North Sichuan Road, Hongkou, to arrest him. Liu Yongzhi, the prosecutor, opened the court for interrogation immediately. Wu directly admitted the embezzlement of public funds, but the actual amount released was 1.4 billion yuan, which was entrusted to someone to discount. Among them, 1 billion yuan was not used, 100 million yuan was loaned out by Wu himself, and 200 million yuan has also been recovered. The case is very clear. After the interrogation, Wu was taken into custody.

### The General Affairs Office Stipulates Three Methods for Applying for the Distribution of Post-Relief Materials

[This newspaper reports] The distribution group of the Post-Relief Work Planning Committee organized by the Shanghai Branch of the General Affairs Office held a meeting the day before yesterday and decided that in the future, the distribution of post-relief materials to various agencies and businesses must be obtained through the distribution method stipulated by the General Office of the General Affairs Office. However, the materials should be studied and utilized by the Post-Relief Work Planning Committee to ensure that each distribution can better meet actual needs and benefit the public, so as to avoid falling into the hands of merchants and hoarding. The association also stipulates three methods for applying for materials: (1) Apply to the General Office for materials based on the application form, (2) Apply to the General Office for materials based on the materials found by the Shanghai Branch that meet the needs, (3) Apply to the General Office for materials based on the distribution material list of the General Office that meet the needs. (This application is made by the Branch to the Joint Distribution Committee of the General Affairs Office to formulate a distribution material list for post-relief and send it to the Work Planning Committee, giving the Committee the priority to study and utilize it within two weeks).

### Dredging Rivers and Allocating Flour

In addition, the distribution group of the association decided to send a letter directly to the Shanghai Branch for approval of the case of the Municipal Works Bureau proposing to dredge the rivers in the suburbs and requesting the allocation of flour for subsidies, because the case is related to work relief.

The committee also went to the Zhenru General Affairs Office Machine Factory to investigate the machines in the factory that are suitable for the use of the two bureaus, and will apply to the Shanghai Branch and then to the General Affairs Office for approval. The committee believes that the current seamen's strike prevents materials from being transported to China, so the work can only focus on planning. Once the materials are unimpeded in the coming spring, concrete work can be carried out actively.

### The Communist Party, Which Hurts the People, is Accused in Shanghai

[This newspaper reports] When Taizhou was occupied by the Communist Party this spring, Lu Jingchuan, the "District Instructor" of the Fifth Point Township of the New Fourth Army, led 600 people to Jiang Laihe's house on March 16 of the lunar calendar to "struggle", killing two pigs, one cow, and 80 stones of rice. Later, Taizhou was recovered by the National Army, and Lu Jingchuan fled to Shanghai, but he accidentally met Jiang Laihe on the way, and Jiang immediately sent him to the police station and transferred him to the Local Court. The Procuratorate has now concluded the investigation and believes that there are indeed major crimes and has filed a public prosecution.

Women's suiting wool, worsted, thick serge, gabardine, and cavalry twill are also in demand. Due to the cold weather, winter sales are increasing. However, prices remain stable due to sufficient market supply, with minimal fluctuations. Sellers, aware of the risks associated with high-profit goods and credit sales, are generally willing to accept lower prices for cash.

Business Tax: Currency Exchange Industry Requests Assessment Based on Capital

Previously, when the business tax for the currency exchange industry in this city was collected by the Direct Taxation Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, it was assessed based on capital, similar to banks. Now that the business tax has been transferred to local collection, the Municipal Finance Bureau has adjusted the collection method and switched to assessing the currency exchange industry based on turnover. The industry argues that the market prices of foreign currencies, stocks, and other assets fluctuate greatly, sometimes multiple times in a single day. Current business is slow, and many businesses are struggling to survive. Therefore, the association has submitted a document to the Finance Bureau, detailing the industry's operating conditions and requesting that the tax assessment remain based on capital. Otherwise, the burden will be unsustainable.

The allocation of yarn numbers and yarn shipped to other regions should be the third and fourth priorities. The discussion then began and adjourned at approximately 5:00 PM. The important resolutions are listed as follows: (1) Each yarn mill should compile statistics on the types and quantities of cotton yarn produced, based on the actual production situation before the implementation of the allocation system, and submit them to the Textile Control Committee's regular meeting yesterday (28th). (2) Each replica product association should compile statistics on the types and quantities of cotton yarn required and submit them to the Textile Control Committee for discussion, in order to coordinate with the yarn numbers supplied by the various yarn mills. (3) The replica product associations often complain that the yarn numbers are not suitable and that the payment dates are limited. In order to improve this, it is proposed to adopt a certificate-based yarn distribution system. Each month, 24,000 pieces of yarn will be allocated. First, each replica product association will allocate the required yarn numbers, and the allocation committee will distribute yarn allocation certificates to each replica factory. Each replica factory can use the certificate to purchase the required yarn numbers from any yarn mill within one month. (4) The Yarn Merchant Association should report the daily quantity of cotton yarn purchased and sold and the customers to the Textile Control Committee. Private factories should submit a list of cotton yarn sold to each yarn number to the Textile Control Committee and the Yarn Merchant Association for verification. (5) The cotton yarn received by the Yarn Merchant Association from each factory should be centrally allocated, with 1,500 pieces prioritized for retailers. The replica product associations, the cotton yarn distribution factories, and the Yarn Merchant Association held separate meetings last night to prepare materials for discussion at today's Textile Control Committee meeting.

Coal Prices Fluctuate, Ultimately Rise Above Previous Market Levels

The coal market saw a continuation of rising prices on Monday, but public associations advised against further speculation and set a deadline for all joint venture delivery orders to be cleared by the end of the month, leading to cautious selling and a quick market correction. On Tuesday, strong demand from end users absorbed the price drop, and the market recovered. On Wednesday, end users, anticipating difficulty returning to old prices, boosted prices to a new high.

42-Count Yarn Reaches New High, 20-Count Yarn Requires Premium; Spot Goods Scarce, Textile Construction Offers Over a Thousand Pieces

[Our Report] Yesterday's yarn market saw transactions at limited prices, mainly Jianzi yarn from Textile Construction and Double Happiness 10-count yarn from Shenxin. Due to high black market prices, the selling side traded 20-count yarn at limited prices, but an extra premium was inevitable. There was no allocation of 42-count yarn, creating a serious shortage. Prices were as high as 4.56 million outside the market, but no sellers were available. Textile Construction listed yarn for sale in the morning, ranging from 6 to 80 count, totaling 1,001 pieces and 30 small packages, which were allocated to 630 members of the Yarn Merchant Association. The number of pieces of each yarn count included 37 pieces of 6-count Sunlight Deputy brand, 86 pieces of 12-count Sunlight, 488 pieces of 20-count Baoguang, 82 pieces of 20-count Lihma, 152 pieces of 32-count Sunlight cone yarn, 136 pieces of 32-count Yanghe cone yarn, 2 pieces of 60-count double-strand unbranded cone yarn, 1 piece of 80-count double-strand unbranded cone yarn, and 17 and 3/4 pieces of 80-count three-strand colored ball. The prices for each yarn count can be found in this newspaper's market price list. Although these quantities were purchased by members of the Yarn Merchant Association, there was still a shortage of the popular 20-count Baoguang brand. Textile companies in the six districts petitioned the Textile Control Committee to change the sales location due to the small size of the association's premises. The Textile Control Committee approved that each factory would open yarn sales at its own distribution location at limited prices.

Low Cotton Inventory; Indian Cotton Expected

The cotton market is showing signs of rising prices in producing areas, but transactions are limited. Only 100 bales of White Low Grade were traded. According to the Cotton Industry Association, current cotton inventory in Shanghai is around 100,000 bales, with Chinese cotton accounting for only one-fifth. Chinese cotton sales have been slow due to high costs, transportation fees, and heavy taxes, making it difficult to compete with American cotton.

Before May 13th of this year, Shanghai manufacturers ordered a total of approximately 110,000 bales of cotton from India. However, the Indian government subsequently banned cotton exports, rendering these orders invalid. Recently, the Indian government approved the export of this batch of Indian cotton, and yesterday sent a telegram to Shanghai trading firms stating that an import license must be submitted for inspection before export.

The Shanghai Cotton Industry Association has decided to broadcast the daily cotton market prices in Shanghai on the Shanghai Radio Station every day from 6:00 PM starting next month (December 1st).

Fine Cloth and Serge Most in Demand

The cotton cloth market remains strong, especially for fine cloth and serge. The limited sale of green Textile Construction fine cloth has created a severe shortage in the market, attracting dyeing and weaving factories. Sales to customers are also good. 5005 bleached cloth rose sharply by 4,000 yuan, and various brands of Burmese cloth rose again by 1,500 to 2,500 yuan. Four Gentlemen and Golden Seal serge rose by 3,500 yuan, and various grades of serge also rose by 1,500 to 2,000 yuan. However, dark blue Shilin An'an cloth and twill cloth did not perform well but remained expensive.

New Land and Mainland Distribution Offices Relocated

The New Land Cotton Weaving Factory, established in 1921 by Pan Shihao and others, is located at 300 Jiangsu East Road with a capital of 100,000 yuan. The capital increased to 8 million yuan in May of this year. Its products include New Land woolen fabric, 99 flannel, New Land poplin, and New Venus woolen fabric, with monthly sales reaching over 1,400 rolls. According to Manager Pan, the factory originally had 46 looms and plans to order 50 more from abroad to expand production. Its distribution office relocated to 210 Fujian Middle Road yesterday, and the distribution office of its affiliated Mainland Dyeing and Weaving Factory also relocated at the same time.

10,000 Barrels of Caustic Soda Arrive Gradually

Inner Door Foreign Firm has received over 2,000 barrels of caustic soda, which will soon be sold at a low price. Caustic soda shipped from Hong Kong has already started to be unloaded. According to a merchant here, two commercial ships from Hong Kong are expected to arrive today, carrying approximately 4,000 barrels of caustic soda. In total, approximately 10,000 barrels have recently arrived, which is sufficient for current needs.

American Cotton Rises

[United Press, New York, 26th] Today's cotton market rose sharply due to purchases by yarn mills, exceeding $2 per bale at one point, but later retreated slightly due to profit-taking. The market remained strong due to a shortage of spot goods and strong demand from weaving mills. Futures closed up 35 cents to $1.30 per bale. New Orleans also reported that today's cotton market rose across the board due to reports of a shortage of spot goods, stimulating buyers. Futures closed up 25 cents to $1.50 per bale.

Imported Pine Market Active

Yesterday, the lumber market saw strong demand for imported pine due to the need for bridges and roads. Chinese fir remained stable.

Americans Predict Price Drops Next Year

[Reuters, New York, 26th] Americans generally expect the price of building materials to fall by 20% and consumer goods by 30% in 1947. However, a return to pre-war price levels will not occur until 1948 or later. Labor unions appear to be changing their demands for wage increases, which would halt rising production costs and restore investor interest.

American Production Reaches Peak This Year

[Reuters, Washington, 26th] The Production Management Agency said that American goods production has reached its peak since the Japanese surrender. While further increases are unlikely, 1947 could be a very good year if certain conditions are met.

Rice Market Continues Weak; Oil Prices Fall Sharply

The supply of rice from the north and south slightly decreased, totaling nearly 10,000 shih. However, shop demand is weak, and the market has been sluggish for a long time. Southern japonica rice continued to plummet by 2,000-3,000 yuan, and northern japonica rice also fell by 1,000-2,000 yuan. Glazed rice followed with a small decline of 1,000 yuan. White Yuanzhong rice also fell by 1,000-2,000 yuan, and Yin Yuan rice flooded the market, continuing to fall by 2,000-3,000 yuan. Buyers are scarce. Flour digestion is also slow, and prices are gradually decreasing, falling another 100-200 yuan with little optimism. The oil market has recently seen shipments from the Northeast, Tianjin, Hankou, and Bengbu, causing local stores to become cautious. The crude oil market is depressed, soybean oil fell by 2,000-3,000 yuan, and rapeseed oil, sesame oil, and clear oil all fell sharply by 3,000-5,000 yuan. Soybean cake demand turned weak, falling a small amount of 1,000-2,000 yuan. Soybean oil mills in various ports and this city have weak buying appetite, falling by 300-500 yuan. Wheat is scarce and stable. Corn has slight activity in Qingdao, and the market is firm. Red sorghum wineries are stagnant, falling another 1,000 yuan. Red beans are flat, mung beans from Southeast Asia continue to be procured and the situation is lively. Sesame from Guangdong slightly moved and has recovered, adding 1,000 yuan.

The allocation of edible oil in this city has already begun since the establishment of the Joint Allocation Office. It is understood that the goods were shipped yesterday, with over 300 dan allocated to the Central District and the Southern and Northern Shanghai districts. The allocated edible oil can be sold openly by retailers starting today at 1,200 yuan per shijin, without quantity restrictions.

Goods Tax Bureau: Approves Tea Tax Amount; Some Tea Merchants Request Exemption for Stored Tea

The Shanghai Tea Industry Commerce Association received a letter from the Shanghai Goods Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, stating that the duty-paid price and tax payable for various types of tea have been approved and will be collected first. Besides presenting the matter to the Tax Administration of the Ministry of Finance for instructions, the tax amount table is attached for reference. The duty-paid price for flower-scented tea is 150,000 yuan, and the tax payable is 15,000 yuan. The duty-paid price for green tea is 69,350 yuan, and the tax payable is 6,940 yuan.

After receiving the letter, the association forwarded it to its members for compliance. Regarding the stored tea, the association pointed out that most of the stored tea in Shanghai was accumulated during the Japanese occupation. The costs of warehousing and management over the years have been substantial. The tea industry is on the verge of bankruptcy. Moreover, the law should not be retroactive. Therefore, the association has requested, on behalf of all its members, that they be exempted from paying supplementary taxes in order to survive.

Tea Market Outlook Bleak

Recently, the tea market in this city has been sluggish. Due to stingy offers from overseas, export traders have become less interested. As for domestic sales, local stores and merchants have become less willing to stock up. It is also said that the colored teas that were shipped from this city before February have not yet been sold out, so inquiries are even more scarce. The overall trend is generally leaning towards a bleak outlook.

Taiwan Sugar Continues to Soften

The sugar market weakened further yesterday as the Taiwan Sugar Corporation's auction date approached. The association's prices have fallen by 4,000 to 5,000 yuan over the past two days, reaching 137,000 yuan for medium and white sugar, 6,000 yuan, 6,500 yuan, and 116,000 yuan for raw sugar. Other Fujian and Guangdong local sugars saw mixed movements with no excessive fluctuations.

Three Approaches to Cultural and Educational Organization Work: American Representative Expresses Views

[US Information Service, Paris, 26th] The committees of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) General Conference are currently discussing the work plan of cultural and educational organizations, and the delegations have commented on the organization's work policy. Mr. McCreesh, the American representative, said at the first meeting of the Planning Committee yesterday that the United States believes that cultural and educational organizations can fully promote their work through the following three approaches: (1) Act as an encouraging institution to stimulate or facilitate all scientific, educational, and artistic activities to promote international cooperation. (2) Act as a service institution to provide global cultural and scientific information to member states. (3) Act as a working institution to implement various programs to eliminate the crisis of understanding that harms the people of the world. He said that the American representative deeply felt that "For any suggestion related to the cultural and educational organization's plan, the primary question we should ask is whether this suggestion will contribute to the established goal, which is 'to promote international cooperation through education, science, and culture, thereby promoting peace and security.'" McCreesh continued: "In any case, the American delegation also believes that the first year should include some important and realistic work, which will open the door for the cultural and educational organization and will show the people of all countries that the work recommended by the cultural and educational organization is indeed urgently needed."

(5) Establishing youth service centers in important areas, so as to use international student groups to engage in reconstruction work. (6) Storing funds for emergency activities. In today's Committee on the Burden of Committee, the Chinese representative commented on the "Strengthening of Aid to China Movement" proposed by others, saying: "The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization should not only collect and disseminate information on the requirements put forward by various poor countries, but also adjust supply and demand at any time. The Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization should urge donor countries to pay attention to the most recent and urgent materials and work, and ensure the fair distribution of these relief materials."

A Petite and Exquisite Record of Suzhou in Spring and Autumn
By Zhao Qingge

Having returned from Hangzhou, I actually toured Suzhou once more. This was entirely due to my cousin's persistence; she had asked me countless times, and I had agreed countless times. Like a debt owed, it was only after a year that I finally repaid it. However, the fleeting visit only added to our mutual melancholy.

Twelve autumns have passed since I last bid farewell to Suzhou. Revisiting this old place today, my mind retains only fragmented and blurred traces of dreams! No matter how hard I try to recall, I can only vaguely remember the mood of that time from the remaining impressions of some scenic spots.

Leaving the house for the Lingering Garden, I found it a desolate and overgrown place! The pavilions and towers were dilapidated, almost like the Liu Manor I saw in Hangzhou. I truly wonder why the government pays so little attention and makes no effort to repair such scenic areas already designated for public enjoyment. Are they so reluctant to spend even a small amount on repairs? I don't understand.

From the Lingering Garden to Tiger Hill, the road is paved with yellow mud, wide but uneven. Sitting in a rickshaw without pneumatic tires, pulled by a coolie without cushioned seat covers, every step brought a jolt, shaking your backside painfully. Upon reaching the mountain gate, after climbing a slope not even half as steep as the Zhangjia Garden in Chongqing, we arrived at what they called the summit. At the summit stood the Tiger Hill Pagoda, built of stone. From afar, it looked quite beautiful, but up close, it was simply a pile of mud in ruins. A clear stream flowed below the mountain, called "Sword Pond." Nearby were historical sites such as the "Nodding Stone," said to be where a monk once preached, and even the stubborn rocks were so moved that they nodded in agreement. Because I loved this story, I even took a photo with these stubborn rocks twelve years ago. This time, I took another photo there. I hope that one day I will also discover a great, world-awakening truth here, so that this stubborn rock of mine can also nod in agreement!

When leaving Tiger Hill, I turned back with every step, feeling unusually lost, as if searching for vanished footprints or gradually capturing memories. I occasionally bent down to pick up a few newly fallen red leaves, and my fingers instantly felt a surge of heat, a surge of blood! I kissed the red leaves and quietly said goodbye!

One dusky evening, I savored the scenery of Lion Grove Garden. Of all the scenic spots in Suzhou, I love Lion Grove Garden the most. Although it also showed signs of neglect, it was still better than the others. One could see that the engineer who designed this garden had a very high level of artistic cultivation. Whether it was a tree, a stone, a bridge, a pavilion, or a row of pink walls, everything was arranged so exquisitely and elegantly, petite and delicate, full of poetic mood and artistic conception. In a secluded courtyard, lush bamboo formed a shade, surrounded by short fences. The autumn wind blew, and fallen leaves tapped on the window glass, making a sound that seemed like sobbing and sighing! So I imagined that Lion Grove Garden was the Xiaoxiang Pavilion of the Grand View Garden. I searched for the parrot cage on the rolled-up curtain; I inquired about the flower mound where fallen petals of spring and autumn were buried. I seemed to faintly hear the sound of broken strings of the guqin, the sound of humming, the sound of coughing, and also the sound of sobbing! But I couldn't see a trace of where these many sounds came from, only the swaying bamboo shadows in the moonlight! I couldn't help but feel a sense of desolation at the loss of people and the emptiness of the building! Stepping out of the secluded depths of Xiaoxiang, I strolled across the winding bridge and gazed at the withered stems of the lotus in the pond. Witnessing flocks of gulls flying back and forth, I felt endless vicissitudes rippling in the fountain of life, and I was disheartened! At this moment, a group of tourists suddenly jumped out of the white stone-built painted boat, laughing and startling me back to my senses. I gazed intently at the sky, and realized that I had briefly left the realm of reality, and now I was back, my mind somewhat dazed!

The next morning, I drove to the Humble Administrator's Garden. During the period of occupation, it was the site of the enemy puppet provincial government, and now it has been taken over by the Social Education College. I immediately visited Mr. Gu Jiankang, who teaches at the college. After a decade apart, my old friend's temples had turned gray! The cruel war ravaged everyone. Mr. Gu led me to visit the entire garden. The place was indeed twice as large as Lion Grove Garden and much cleaner. Perhaps because it had been tainted by the footprints of a group of dogs, I wasn't very interested. At the same time, the noise of the crowd ruined the elegant mood. However, a few continuing piano sounds, along with the songs of birds flying through the air, still allowed me to faintly smell some of the breath of nature!

After leaving the Humble Administrator's Garden, I originally wanted to visit the Canglang Pavilion and Hanshan Temple, but I heard that the Canglang Pavilion was the site of the Suzhou Art School and was closed to visitors, and it was also severely desolate. As for Hanshan Temple, it was even worse! The Japanese invaders had stolen the ancient bell from the temple, which greatly spoiled the scenery, so going there would only increase my anger, so I decided not to go. So I strolled through the Xuanmiao Temple in the city and toured the cityscape of Suzhou.

Xuanmiao Temple is like the Xiangguo Temple in Kaifeng and the City God Temple in Shanghai. Inside, there were stalls selling snacks, miscellaneous toys, fortune-telling services, and flowers and birds. In the main hall, there were also many shops selling calligraphy and paintings in the national style, with red and green streamers hanging all over the walls, depicting stories circulating among the people, or gods, ladies, and dolls. I remember when I was little, before the New Year, my father would buy these doll paintings and hang them on my bedside. These types of paintings were usually rarely inquired about, and only during the New Year were they particularly prosperous. Now, because the Spring Festival was approaching, every painting shop was busy rushing to produce them. The painters ranged from twelve or thirteen years old to sixty or seventy years old, some with sores on their faces, some with only one eye, and they all looked very poor. Relying on a brush manipulated by a mechanical hand, earning a living was not easy. Although these painters didn't have much knowledge, their hearts were very kind. They drew inspiration from historical anecdotes of loyalty, filial piety, and righteousness, and the educational effect they achieved was no less than that of ordinary "experts" and "masters"! However, they could only cower in the inconspicuous and dimly lit ancient temples, and they had no honor to receive social courtesy, because they were a group of insignificant people who could not enter the "hall of great elegance"!

In front of Xuanmiao Temple was the busiest street in Suzhou. The largest teahouse was called Wu Yuan, and the most elegant teahouse was called Yi Yuan. It is said that leisurely locals spend the whole day there, whether it's discussing business or talking about love, it's all suitable. This custom is very similar to that of Chengdu. I love this custom, so I love Chengdu and also love Suzhou. If one day I am qualified to rest, then I will definitely come to such a place and live for a year and a half, or even permanently.

In the hour before my departure, my cousin and I and others were still enjoying a special feast in a clean and elegant small tavern. The famous clear water crabs were plump and delicious. Drinking and chatting with old friends, I truly felt like I wouldn't return until I was drunk!

Finally, I hastily left Suzhou again, but this time she gave me a deeper impression. Back in Shanghai, I still can't forget Suzhou's exquisite elegance and Suzhou's petite and exquisite charm! (Evening of November 20, 35th year, Shanghai Bund)

### A Few Words on Poetry By Lin Feng

Someone said: "Poets are magicians of language." I say poets are discoverers of truth. Writing poetry is not just about inspiration; genuinely experiencing a vibrant life will reveal more poetic material. Classical poets write poetry to praise, modern poets write poetry to create: people use his voice to move forward, to know which places are traps and abysses, and which places are worth lingering and returning to.

### Record of Returning Home by Lü Baihua

Half a Day in Tianzhu

"The water shimmers, clear and bright on sunny days; the mountain colors are strangely beautiful even in sudden rain." Since Su Dongpo scattered these two lines of poetry, West Lake has become an abstract beauty in the eyes of later generations, good at all times whether lightly or heavily made up. But "good at all times" neglects the night. I believe that boating on West Lake at night is even better than in sunshine or rain. So day and night, I and Zhun bought a boat for another tour. The oars beat the surface of the lake at night. Because there was no moon, we passed through the Broken Bridge, the boat gently touching the lotus leaves. Especially a kind of elegant tranquility seemed to surpass the ordinary world.

The next day, Ziyou ran over early in the morning. He took half a day off to accompany me to Tianzhu. The warmth of friendship made my weary traveler's heart excited. From Hubin to Lingyin, there were public buses every few minutes. The bus drove across the lake embankment and climbed the steep mountain road. Thousands of wisps of moisture soaked my clothes, and pure emptiness filled my embrace. This is something that cannot be touched in Shanghai. The best part of Lingyin is the cluster of peaks in front of the mountain gate, called "Flying Peak." In the past, the old man Quyuan often lingered here, because there is a Cold Spring under Flying Peak. He cleverly matched the phrase "Since when did the spring begin to be cold? From where did the mountain fly?" with "The spring began to be cold when it was cold, and the mountain flew from where it flew." According to legend, Flying Peak was originally called Lingjiu Peak: "In the Jin Dynasty, the Western monk Huili ascended this mountain and sighed, 'This is a small ridge of Lingjiu Mountain in the Tianzhu Kingdom. I don't know when it flew here'?" Looking at the cluster of peaks overlapping in the middle, many Buddha statues are engraved, and the clamorous sound of water flows from the foot of the peak, which is indeed very impressive. We walked into a small cave. A monk stood up, pointed to the top with a bamboo pole, and said to us, "This is a line of sky!" After saying that, he reached out his hand to ask us to donate some green, equal to a beggar on the street. Although he was inevitably pitiful, I couldn't help but feel wronged for the famous mountain.

Outside the mountain gate, a long row of bamboo sedan chairs were lined up, which was the business of going to Gaoyan. We turned towards Tianzhu. The chair carriers bargained fiercely, insisting on eight thousand yuan. Ziyou told me that the people of Yizhou were the worst in this regard. They were clearly "gouging us." We offered him three thousand, which he naturally refused, but after walking a distance and then another distance, we actually caught up to the halfway point of the mountain. He waved his hand, meaning he agreed to the deal. Ziyou got angry and simply didn't sit, anyway, it wasn't much further to Lower Tianzhu. Further up, it was written "Middle Tianzhu Kingdom." These four characters were quite vigorous. We entered the hall. A traveling monk talked with us for a long time. He mentioned Master Hongyi, saying that no one could chant sutras like him, but he was not boastful. I had seen Hongyi's calligraphy at the home of Xia Mianzun, and I had also seen the elephant that Hongyi made for Xia Mianzun. Master Hongyi was the only great monk in China. It was a pity that we met too late. It could be said that this traveling monk was not vulgar to pay attention to his deeds.

Further up was Upper Tianzhu, where the Great Earth of Perfect Penetration was enshrined. "Perfect Penetration" also gives us an enlightenment on how to live our lives. Buddhism divides "Righteous Law" and "Perfect Penetration" into two terms. It seems that in the "Breaking Text Nirvana," it was discussed that the Righteous Law Eye Treasury cannot despise Perfect Penetration. The distance between the three Tianzhu temples is a straight upward mountain path. After all, it is not the Western Tianzhu, only adorned with three temples. The scenery is far inferior to Lingyin, but just on this straight upward mountain path, winding, is very meaningful, indeed "three sides are blocked by mountains, the middle road is a straight pass, like two valleys."

Suddenly, heavy rain poured down the mountain, and we hurriedly left the Han Valley-like Three Tianzhu.

Solemn appearance under Flying Peak,
Overgrown weeds are now half-eroded;
Is it suitable for beggars to beg at the Qushou,
Suspended sounds between the rocks are like the Wu Xiao!

Traveling monk in Middle Tianzhu Kingdom,
Can speak of the former teacher Hongyi;
If you understand the reason, you will fly away,
Transmitting scriptures with blood written by ten fingers.

### Old Dan's Statement

In the issue of the 25th of this month, this publication published an article "From the Perspective of Sexual Psychology, Talking about Havelock Ellis." The original was written in Chongqing last summer. In a hurry, Havelock Ellis and Havelock Harris were discussed as one, and no separate title was listed. Now that I have realized this, I would like to apologize to the readers and acknowledge my mistake. Old Dan Zhi.

### One Inch of Mountain, One Inch of Blood By Ye Jingfeng, 106

"Brother, we've already performed the formalities of the social scene. You shouldn't be so overly polite with me..." Pingzi corrected her expression, her two bright and sparkling eyes gazing at Hejian. But to say she corrected her expression is not quite right. For someone as charming and alluring as Pingzi, her expressions were limited to just two: smiling and crying. And even then, she was only expressing something other than smiling when she was crying extremely sadly, covering her face so her expression couldn't be seen. Otherwise, even if she was angry, furious, annoyed, sorrowful, or even scolding someone fiercely, there always seemed to be a hint of a smile between her eyebrows and the corners of her mouth. Just imagine, as in the old novels, "almond eyes," "willow eyebrows," "peach cheeks," "lotus face," and so on—just close your eyes and imagine these outlines and arrangements, and you can imagine that this is a naturally sweet and smiling expression, how could it possibly be fierce and stern?

So when it says here that Pingzi corrected her expression, it just means she reined in some of her smile. What's strange is that in the short few minutes since Hejian left, Pingzi's attitude suddenly changed, and her tone also changed. The perfectly fine Mr. Hejian, Hejian-kun, changed in an instant to Brother. This kind of address, which is neither Westernized nor purely Japanese, has a bit of a "China" semi-affectionate and semi-江湖 flavor. Where did it jump out from? What kind of riddle is hidden within it? Of course, Hejian couldn't help but be surprised when he heard this suddenly changing style.

"Of course, the wild boar must have inquired about him, and reported everything about me." She resumed her original playfulness, smiling quietly, indicating that Hejian's actions just now were all within her clear observation. She saw that Hejian seemed confused on the outside, smiling along, but his heart was probably more shaken than if he had been hit by a cannonball. Feeling a little unbearable, she immediately stopped laughing.

"Brother, you don't need to be surprised." She softened her voice, moving closer to Hejian, as if whispering in his ear, "My father and your father have been very close in recent years. Perhaps you don't know that, brother. The two old generations are as close as brothers, so it's probably not too presumptuous for me to call you brother, is it?"

Hejian was, after all, someone who had weathered storms, so Pingzi's successive changes, each more startling than the last, he still managed to hold on and maintain his composure, determined to see what her grand finale would be.

"Brother, your work at the General Headquarters on the mainland is so active. Every time I see it in the newspapers, and hear the two old men's various comments about you over wine and tea, I can't help but admire you. It's just a pity that I also have duties on this side, and I can't get away. Otherwise, I would definitely come to the mainland, even if it's just to follow your orders, I would still be honored... But..."!

"Praise... too much praise, but..."? Hejian was eager to hear what she was going to say next, unwilling to stall any longer.

"Yes..."! Pingzi seemed to completely understand Hejian's meaning, so she quickly continued, "But according to the General Headquarters' position, everything you do, brother, is of course in line with their ideals. But my father and your father have a different view: they think you've gone astray. As for what counts as going astray, I can't explain it clearly at the moment. I hope you'll understand that, brother."

### Small Record by Lu Yan By Li Jinming

Lu Yan, a native of Daihai, Zhejiang, is said by some to be one of the more stable writers. He came to Changsha in 1927 for a certain creation, but he always refused to stay in the city of Changsha for a moment. He was willing to live in a small building in a folk house on the Shuilu Zhou, and go to the beach every day to meet friends. Sometimes, when he was mentally unstable, she said:

"Isn't it okay to live in Shuilu Zhou? Is it necessarily that Shuilu Zhou is completely under the jurisdiction of Changsha?"

In 1931, he edited a literary magazine in Guilin, unaware of that extraordinary era. He obviously wanted to create a small paradise, and pull a few friends to jointly enjoy the dream of the Peach Blossom Spring, where they were frightened every day. Even so, someone after all pointed out that he was not faithful. Saying that he was timid and wanted to compromise with the invaders. So he shouted loudly in a novel:

"Am I that kind of person—compromising with the invaders... I oppose them the most, I oppose them the most—"

His works are rarely influenced by trends. He has translated from Finnish, Czech, New Greek, New Jewish, Bulgarian... and other short works, experiencing a moderate view of life, and dissolving it into his own art with the meaning of his bourgeois life, which can very well arouse the recognition of people with deeper social and political anger. Like H.G. Wells, he is a "rough brush" writer, and his articles do not seem to be carefully polished. He sometimes looks down on creation; "Just write it down, why bother collecting it!" He once said this kind of emotional words to people.

But the excellent achievements left by Mr. Lu Yan in the literary world are the short stories he translated in the 16th and 17th years of the Republic of China, such as Ding Linke, Henryk Sienkiewicz's Old Servant, At the Springside... like the beauty of a complete style, he was praised by people, and he collected it in Guilin in 1932 and reprinted it. He gave this to his friends who came to visit him... At this time, he was already ill with hemorrhoids and lay in bed in a small building in northwest Guilin all day long.

After all, there are many friends who love Lu Yan, and they all praise him for sacrificing for literature and art from beginning to end. He does not kick at the environment he is in. He often says to people:

"I write, learn Esperanto from Ai Luo Xianhe, all because of my own efforts. My family is not very good, and in order to save money, I was instructed by the head of the family when I was young—to seek truth from facts and work as an apprentice in a store. During this period, I worked hard during the day and read magazines and novels at night; the owner's wife pitied me for getting tuberculosis from lack of rest and dismissed me. But I had already cultivated the desire to write in those short years and learned to describe things in vernacular. In the next few years, I began to associate with bookstores, and also met Master Zhou Yu Cai in the form of correspondence. The new tide of the May Fourth Movement is welcoming my ship..."

Being sharp and working hard is after all extraordinary—in the fourteenth year, he was a teacher at the Beijing Esperanto School; in the sixteenth year, he compiled and printed his debut short stories, translation collections, and served as a member of the Shishanshan Road Esperanto Society; in the twenty-second year, he went to Xi'an. In the twenty-seventh year, he came to Changsha again, then went to Hankou, and the following year, went to Guangxi and served as a teacher at the Rongxian Liuqing Normal School; in the thirty-first year, he began to edit a literary magazine. The following year, he suffered from hemorrhoids, and the operation did not save him. People collected medical expenses for him, and his ex-wife Shi Nv Tu returned home (Xiangxiang). Within a few months, he died of illness on the way to Guilin.

Isn't Lu Yan's loss equal to the fall of a star? 20, 9, 35 years old in Hu.

### Free Talk: Wool Felt By Shao Fu

Last night, the north wind was strong, and the streets seemed even more desolate. People's various needs for protection against the cold naturally felt particularly pressing. Among them, the minimum requirement is clothing and bedding, so-called warm clothes and warm sleep.

A few days ago, the public education personnel goods distribution office had negotiated with the Materials Supply Bureau to handle the distribution of military wool felt under the heading of surplus U.S. military materials. The result of the registration of public education personnel in the city was that about 50,000 items were needed. All procedures had been completed, and everyone was naturally waiting for this wool felt to increase the warmth of the cold night. However, news came that the Supply Bureau overturned the past agreement on the grounds of "no goods in stock." At the same time, it was also heard that dozens of merchants purchased the wool felt under various names and sold it at high prices on the black market. They purchased the wool felt and sold it at high prices on the black market.

These news, in this weather with howling north winds, made people feel even colder when they heard it.

We are not willing to investigate whether it is true or not, and how it happened. We only hope that the Supply Bureau will quickly distribute this batch of wool felt to everyone, otherwise, it will be suspicious.

Since its establishment, the Supply Bureau has done a lot of work. We feel that it is not a purely commercial organization after all, but it cannot fail to take into account the welfare of the people.

### I am a Little Soldier By Zhang Peide

It's only been fifteen days, and I'm already looking forward to the end of the month; but what's there to be happy about when the end of the month comes? Receiving a pay slip and a few thin banknotes from the squad leader, I can only swallow my tears into my stomach.

Salary: 8,000 yuan
Straw sandals subsidy: 200 yuan
Deducted insufficient food expenses: 800 yuan
Remaining: 7,400 yuan.

7,400 yuan, this amount is the reward for a month. This money is enough for young masters to watch a play once, enough for young ladies to take a ride once.

In all conscience, I am indeed patriotic. For the sake of patriotism, I left my old mother and abandoned my profession during the Anti-Japanese War to become a soldier from thousands of miles away. But in recent years, especially after the victory, the doubts in my heart have piled up layer by layer like the silt in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. I love my country, but has my country ever loved me? How many parents would be willing to let their beloved children freeze and starve? Similarly, which country would let its soldiers live in poverty?

I haven't been on the street for a few days, because I don't want to go on the street either. The gazes swept over by those high-spirited adults, gentlemen, young masters, and young ladies often contain a bit of contempt, ridicule, and mockery. Especially when passing in front of them, they turn their heads, hold their breath, and are afraid that a stench will rush into their noses. Yes, we may be stained with the blood of the enemy, and we may be a bit poor, but it's always better than the copper stink and superficiality on their bodies!

In the year since the victory, we have been deeply discriminated against. Of course, there are a few soldiers and even impostors who have caused trouble outside, but this cannot represent the discipline of the entire Chinese army. Because some soldiers rode on buses without tickets and watched plays without tickets, the × department ×× department posted public notices, ordering them to be stopped and even holding meetings to discuss ways to ban them. Is it difficult to say that soldiers are born willing to ride "white buses," watch "white plays," and commit "white crimes"? Who will think about our soldiers' situation? Postal and telecommunications fares have increased fivefold, and ××× salaries have increased × times, but what about us? In July, I heard that salaries would be increased by 60%, several meetings were held, and repeated orders were issued, but we haven't received it yet. I believe our salaries, like postal and telecommunications, will certainly be more refreshing than those of adults and gentlemen to take the bus and watch plays.

In fact, those comrades who want to ride white buses and watch white plays are thinking too much. Entertainment, is that something you get? You are a Chinese soldier; you have won, and you have to be locked in the barracks.

My mother's letter came almost two months ago, saying that bandits are causing trouble and she can't survive. And after being away for a few years, I should have been promoted to some kind of official. Remember my mother who is suffering at home, and if I can't go home, I must send some money back no matter what. These words are like thorns piercing my heart.

The autumn wind is rising, blowing coldly on my body. The bayonet reflects the dark light, revealing a pale light. Is it satire or mockery?

Lying under the thin military blanket, still waiting for the dawn.

### Think and Say By Min

Someone said: The more the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union diverges, the faster Japan will recover.

Someone said: The National Assembly was convened in violation of the Political Consultative Conference agreement, so they will not participate; and the Political Consultative Conference stipulated that the date of the National Assembly was May 5, 35th year of the Republic of China. This probably means they will never participate in the National Assembly convened in Nanjing.

Someone said: The constitution produced this time will be handed over to the "Alliance" after it is enacted, in order to guarantee the "domestic legal rights."

Now some old people are a little unwilling to join the Communist Party, they are afraid of being unfashionable to say good things for the government, and they are afraid of being inconvenient to join the Third Party. Making a living is nothing but fame and fortune, it is really depressing and depressing.

### Alarm By Jing Tian

Thinking of danger in times of peace

The air raid siren, the long siren, still makes me shudder when I think of it. After the victory, the heart-pounding "air raid siren" was changed to the loud "echo" at noon, which made people feel a sense of "peace and prosperity." Some people say that the echo means "the sound of victory," because the "回" of "echo" is taken from the V of Victory! It's really good at praising and wonderful beyond words.

The other day was Air Defense Day. In the morning, the "air raid siren" suddenly sounded, followed by the sound of machines. If it had been between July and August last year, I don't know how worried I would have been, but today, hearing it, I have a feeling of "unusual ease." But, friends, in today's world where the great powers are actively preparing for war again, and where the little bastards on the other side say "we'll meet again," who can guarantee that this siren won't "turn fake into real" someday!

Thinking of danger in times of peace, we should be vigilant, and put fewer words like "victorious country," "one of the four great powers," and "national demeanor" in our minds!

### Fairytale By Yin

A child said: "Old people are cunning and sly, young people are glib and smooth-tongued; only children are pure and innocent"!

### News Figures: Mr. Zhang Dongsun By Zheng Feng

Northern Leader of the Social Democratic Party

A short stature, energetic spirit, a pair of light-colored glasses on the bridge of his nose, this is another giant of the Social Democratic Party—Professor Zhang Dongsun, the leader of the Social Democratic Party in North China.

This Mr. Zhang is an old professor and philosopher who is 63 years old. Generally speaking, his scholarly atmosphere seems to be stronger than his political atmosphere. He is a native of Suzhou and studied in Japan. He also came from the journalism industry; in the early years of the Republic of China, he served as the director of the Gonghe Daily, Fuyu Magazine, Dazhonghua Magazine, and Zhengyi Magazine, and also served as the editor-in-chief of the Shishi Xinbao.

It is said that Mr. Zhang's arguments published in the newspaper were very "strange," and the degree of "strangeness" can be illustrated by one thing. When Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the father of the nation, passed away in the fourteenth year of the Republic of China, Mr. Zhang published an article in the Shishi Xinbao entitled "Mr. Sun Yat-sen is Dead!" The word "竟" is truly "strange" to use.

After that, Mr. Zhang turned to the education field and served as a philosophy professor at the National Chengchi University, Shanghai Guanghua University, Guanxian Northeast University, and Peiping Peking University. Everyone knows that Mr. Zhang has written several books that are among the best in the country, such as "Philosophy and Science," "Reason Philosophy," and "New Philosophy Theory," and his translations include "Metabolism" and "Matter and Memory."

During the Anti-Japanese War, he organized the "Northern National Salvation Association," which included "non-party and non-faction" as well as representatives of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. The main work was to send people to rear areas and provide intelligence. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, Mr. Zhang was arrested and monitored by the enemy for some time.

He had a deep private relationship with Mr. Zhang Junmai. After the establishment of the Social Democratic Party, he became the person in charge in North China. When the Social Democratic Party's participation in the National Assembly became quite heated, Mr. Zhang seemed to be even more involved. Zhang Dongsun's name was not seen in the list submitted by the Social Democratic Party. Like Mr. Zhang Junmai, he also took on the role of a professor.

### Story of a Misleading Professor By Holy

It is said that one day, four big characters suddenly appeared on the blackboard of a school classroom: "Misleading Students." The class bell rang, but the janitor did not come to the classroom to wipe off the words on the blackboard. When a certain professor hurriedly stepped into the classroom, he did not notice it for a while, and still talked endlessly about the old plaster of the past. Five minutes later, when he turned around to write on the blackboard with chalk, he suddenly discovered those four big characters, and suddenly his expression was awkward. The whole classroom burst into laughter, and then he hurriedly explained a lot of principles, implying that he did not "mislead students." At the same time, he said to the students: "Who wrote this?" Not a single student answered. Finally, a student stood up and said: "Sir! I was one of the first to arrive, and I saw these four characters as soon as I came in. It was probably written by the students in the previous class. Please don't suspect us!" The professor himself was "guilty," so he let it pass!

Originally, the matter was like this: On the first day of class, this professor held the "fooling around" doctrine and talked nonsense about things unrelated to the topic. He was not lecturing, but promoting the author of a book. The students did not have this book, and what he talked about was beyond the scope of the subject. Of course, the students were very impatient. However, he still continued to muddle along regardless. It was probably less than an hour! The professor said: "I'm sorry, everyone, I have a little something to do today. I won't be teaching the next hour, I'm very sorry." Originally, the students were already dissatisfied with him, but he had to run away early, which was too much. Therefore, a student couldn't help but stood up with an iron face and said: "Sir! What you lecture about makes us fall into a fog, it's simply inexplicable. I don't know what class you are actually teaching. If you are talking about ××××, there is Professor ××, if you are talking about ×××, there is Professor ×××, we don't need knowledge outside of the topic that conflicts with another subject. At the same time, we pay money to study, not to be ghosts, so we naturally hope to get some real things. Therefore, please don't lecture like this again next time, and it's best not to leave early, please finish the two hours before leaving. This is a small suggestion from the students, I'm being presumptuous!" After hearing this, the professor blushed, mumbled a few perfunctory words, and ran away. This was the first time.

The second time he taught, the professor was still the same old tune, and even more clever than the previous time. He took a book and read from it, and copied the news from the newspaper onto the blackboard. In this way, it was easier to muddle through the time, and the students hated him even more. They almost thought he was a bit like old cowhide candy, with a face as thick as a city wall. When they met this kind of person, everyone could only shake their heads. Finally, a certain student, again "as before," stood up and asked him a bunch of questions, asking him to answer. Although the professor knew that he was not good, he still had no shame, and said hundreds of words, indicating that he had answered the student very correctly. At this time, the professor's savior, the dismissal bell, rang, and he ran away again. This was the second time.

With these two records, he of course deserved the four characters "Misleading Students" on the blackboard!

### Nurturing Talents By Jia Ling

The Westinghouse Foundation of the United States is committed to the cultivation of scientific talents. It began selecting geniuses in senior middle schools in 1942. There are 15,000 male and female geniuses selected, with female students accounting for about one-quarter. Among them, 1,500 are "future scientists." 147 outstanding boys and 53 girls each received a scholarship of US$55,000. Currently, 106 people are studying at 57 universities in the United States, and 73 people have just been discharged from the military and will continue their research work.

The sixth annual selection began at the end of September this year, presided over by Watson Davis, chairman of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. 27,000 public and private middle schools in the United States can participate, and it is expected that 3,500 geniuses can be selected, among which 40 will be reselected. These future scientists will gather for five days at the Washington Science Talent Center next year for training and receive scholarships. (Translated from Science, OCT 1948)

### Frontier By Gu Pei

A few days ago, I read a newsletter about the frontier in the newspaper, as if I was having a dream!

Speaking of the frontier, we are very ashamed. Such a country with remote borders does not even have an accurate map or a detailed and accurate statistics. History tells us that the disasters in Chinese freedom history mostly originated in the frontier. The Huns in ancient times and Xinjiang in modern times are complicated situations, but the reasons are very simple. They are all because we are too ignorant of the situation in the frontier. Therefore, disasters occur in a hurry, and we are at a loss.

Just as the Xinjiang representative to the National Assembly said: "The government does not understand the frontier too

### Seamen's Association Established

The Chinese Seamen's Business Colleagues Association, ordered to be prepared for establishment, has been ready for six months. On the 25th of this month, a founding meeting was held at the Xingzhong School on Avenue Foch at 2:00 PM. More than 100 members, all business directors of Jianghai ships, attended. The chairman first reported the purpose of the establishment order and the preparation process. Yang Xiaotian, a special commissioner from the Seamen's Union, attended and gave instructions. Sun Liping, a member of the union committee, made a speech stating three points: (1) All business colleagues should maintain close contact with the association to enrich the organization. (2) Each should exert their strength in their position to promote the development of shipping. (3) All business colleagues should be guided by the spirit of mutual support and be in a leading position to train other sailors on the ship, unify forces, and strengthen the organization. He hoped that the colleagues of the association would earnestly implement these points. Fifteen directors, seven alternate directors, five supervisors, and three alternate supervisors were immediately elected, and the draft charter of the association was approved. The ceremony was completed around 5:00 PM, and a photo was taken for remembrance.

### Tao Berlin Detained for Five Days; Staying at a Friend's House Turns Into Becoming a Lover

[Our Newspaper's Report] Tao Berlin, the ex-husband of the "Mermaid" Yang Xiuqiong, is a famous jockey. Since coming last year, he has not easily found a suitable residence and has been staying at the home of his friend Chen Ren at 151 Putuo Road. Because Chen was often away on business, only his wife, Ms. Wang (35 years old, from Changsha), remained at home. Due to their close proximity, affection gradually arose, and they finally went together to Room 12 of the Taihe Hotel on Seymour Road in March of last year to have their first physical relationship. Afterwards, they continued to enjoy each other from time to time. Recently, Chen discovered this, and confronted Ms. Wang, who frankly admitted to the affair. Chen was extremely angry and reported it to the police station in charge. The police dispatched officers to bring Tao to the station for questioning. Tao also admitted to having an adulterous relationship with Ms. Wang. Just as the police station was preparing to transfer Tao and Wang to the District Prosecutor's Office, Chen suddenly considered the impact on his reputation and requested the police station to withdraw the charges, stating that he did not want to escalate the situation. The police station, considering that although the case of Tao and Wang could be withdrawn by her husband, Chen, they still violated the law and should be detained for five days as a warning.

(1) Hoarse Voice

Cui Zhuodong asks: I am 37 years old and have had lung disease for six years. I cough and spit yellow phlegm, especially in the morning. Other than that, I have no other symptoms. My diet and bowel movements are normal, but my throat has been hoarse since April of last year, and it has not healed for more than a year.

Please tell me: (1) Is this disease caused by the residual poison of that boil, and can it be cured? How to treat it? Is there a specific medicine that can be applied? (2) Can the hair be regrown? (3) Can rubbing fresh ginger on the scalp make the hair grow back?

[Answer from Dr. Tang Renjin, Doctor of Medicine]

Yesterday, large players manipulated Chinese stocks, opening much lower to attract short sellers to cover. As a result, buying sentiment turned around, stirring short covering. The rally was significant. Xinyi opened slightly lower, but when Yongsha Exchange 151 deliberately sold sharply, the opening price plummeted to 450 yuan, attracting short sellers. Therefore, the delivery of Yongmiao Exchange opened with everyone rushing to buy, reversing to a higher opening. After the opening, prices rose from low to high. Numbers 176, 151, 173, and 199 entered the market aggressively. Guangbang took a two-pronged approach, buying both spot and delivery Yongsha, boosting buying momentum. However, there was a slight pullback after 10:00 AM. Then, Meiya spot was bought by number 199 and hit the limit up, sparking renewed risk appetite. Yongsha approached the 500 yuan mark. From 10:00 to 11:30 AM, Guangbang occasionally sold, and number 152 and others sold off, causing a slight pullback. But the struggle after the drop was intense. Numbers 28, 36, 151, and 83 all entered the market, and number 89 covered shorts. As a result, the 500 yuan mark was finally broken again. Number 165 aggressively entered delivery Yongsha, and number 44 aggressively entered spot Yongsha. Near noon, all stocks soared again. Number 157 posted a limit up for Match, and number 173 posted a limit up for Company. The entire market was filled with buying sentiment. At noon, Guangbang continued to supply, and number 151 also took the opportunity to sell, causing a slight pullback. In the end, the mood was optimistic, and the short squeeze took shape. The afternoon close was still firm, with Xinyi forming an inverted market and Yongsha rising by 10% compared to the previous close, Huafeng up by half a percent, and the rest up by more than 10%.

In the afternoon, only spot transactions were made. At the opening, the momentum of the noon close continued, and prices were high, but soon they were forced down by sellers. As the pullback began, the mood suddenly became timid. Numbers 180, 199, and others all sold, and number 89 and others suppressed prices most aggressively. Buyers were hesitant, and prices soon fell continuously. The limit up Meiya also pulled back. When Yongsha retreated to 490 yuan, numbers 198 and 185 and others entered the market, temporarily rising by more than ten yuan. However, number 180 and others did not stop selling, and the struggle continued until the close. Compared to the previous close, Yongsha, Xinyi, and Huafeng rose by a little more than half a percent, and Meiya, Jingfu, Yonggong, Xinguang, and Qinxing each rose by about 10%. Cold stocks lacked trading activity after the opening. Ruian, Yongni, and Wuhe all fell.

Delivery only traded for half a day, with Yongsha, Xinyi, Xinguang, and Qinxing rising by 10%, and Meiya and Jingfu each rising by 15%. The rise and fall of stocks outside the market were minimal.
