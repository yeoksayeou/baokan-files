### Soviet Troops to Withdraw from Northeast Next Month; Madame Chiang Arrives in Changchun to Console the Military and Civilians

[Our newspaper, Beiping, 21st dispatch] Madame Chiang arrived here yesterday and, after a brief stay, proceeded to Changchun.

Chairman Bids Farewell with Deep Emotion; Letter Addressed to Soviet Troops in China

[Our newspaper, Beiping, 21st dispatch] The Soviet troops, who have successfully completed their mission to liberate the Northeast, will withdraw from the Northeast to their home country on February 1st. Chairman Chiang bids farewell with deep emotion and has specially sent Madame Chiang to the Northeast to comfort the Soviet troops and soldiers. He has also printed 400,000 copies of a letter addressed to the Soviet troops in China, which Madame Chiang will carry to distribute. The full text is as follows: To Marshal Rodion Malinovsky and the brave Soviet soldiers, August 9, 1945, will forever leave the most glorious memory for mankind in this Allied anti-aggression world war. In particular, we, the Chinese people, will never forget this day. Thanks to your country's declaration of war on Japan, our two countries finally obtained a most glorious opportunity to fight side by side with the Japanese aggressors, defeating the Japanese warlords in our Northeast and liberating the 30 million compatriots in the Northeast of our country from the hoofs of the aggressors after 14 years of oppression. Brave Soviet soldiers, today, in the position of Chairman of the National Government of the Republic of China and Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, I represent the Chinese government and all the military and civilians to express our sincere condolences and heartfelt gratitude to you. Looking back, our two countries, China and the Soviet Union, have had a deep traditional friendship from the beginning. As early as 20 years ago, our Founding Father Sun Yat-sen and your country's leader Vladimir Lenin laid a good foundation for the revolutionary cooperation between China and the Soviet Union. Our two countries have long had the oath to advance hand in hand and jointly dedicate ourselves to the great cause of human liberation. I am convinced that after this unprecedented victory against aggression, only the sincere cooperation and mutual assistance between the Allied countries can consolidate world peace and achieve human progress. In particular, our two countries, China and the Soviet Union, should forever maintain the great traditional friendship of the past and continue to carry it forward, so as to forever ensure the victory we have gained and strive for lasting world peace after the war. This time, your advance into the Northeast of our country was to promote the early realization of global peace and was a coordinated action taken with China and other Allied nations. Under the great leadership of Chairman Joseph Stalin, with invincible bravery and superior equipment, coupled with the efforts of our compatriots in the Northeast, in a very short period of time, you disintegrated the enemy entrenched in the Northeast of our country, accelerating the surrender of the Japanese bandits and the restoration of the Northeast. The glorious achievements you have established will forever be remembered by our compatriots throughout the country. Now that the mission of your army in the Northeast of our country is about to be completed and you are about to return to your country, I have specially sent Madame Chiang to express my sincere condolences and respect for the farewell, and I wish you boundless progress under the leadership of Chairman Stalin, and I wish you happiness. Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the National Government of the Republic of China and Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission.

### Political Consultative Conference Postponed for Three Days; Comprehensive Group to Be Established Soon; Chairman Chiang to Host All Representatives Tonight

[Our newspaper, Chongqing, 22nd dispatch] The Political Consultative Conference's group meeting did not take place on the 21st. The National Assembly, the Constitutional Draft Outline, and three other groups continued their discussions on the 22nd, and the Equal Status group joined as well. However, opinions from all sides still differ, so the conference is bound to be postponed again. All members are busy with group negotiations and rarely reveal information. From the Comprehensive Group's indirect sources and general speculation, the difficulty lies in: A. Many of the issues in each group are interconnected and cannot be resolved separately. Therefore, the comprehensive group proposed by Zhang Lisheng will inevitably be established to summarize and seek possible conclusions. B. Regarding military issues, negotiations cannot proceed and an agreement cannot be reached until a three-person group, including advisors who have returned to Chongqing, discusses various technical issues to seek a concrete plan for the reorganization of the Communist army. To date, the CCP still insists that the nationalization of the army and political democratization should proceed simultaneously, while the government believes that national unity and stability can only be guaranteed after the nationalization of the army, which can then ensure genuine democracy. C. Regarding the issue of old representatives to the National Assembly, the CCP and the Democratic League still insist on not recognizing them. However, from various signs, this issue can be resolved from the overall issue after the Comprehensive Group begins its work.

[Our newspaper, Chongqing, 22nd dispatch] Chairman Chiang will host all representatives of the Political Consultative Conference at the National Government Auditorium on the evening of the 23rd.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd dispatch] The Political Consultative Conference was originally scheduled to close on the 23rd, but as negotiations have not yet been completed, the Chairman of the National Government has decided to postpone it for three days.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd dispatch] The military group, the government reorganization group, the policy outline group, and the constitutional draft group of the Political Consultative Conference's subcommittees held meetings at the National Government this afternoon to reach partial agreements on various issues, and will continue negotiations tomorrow. In addition, the Comprehensive Group will also be established soon. Representatives from all sides have been invited to be nominated, and a meeting is scheduled for 4:00 PM tomorrow.

### Marshall and Chairman Chiang Meet to Discuss Ways to Stop Conflict; Supervisory Groups Sent to Xuzhou and Hancheng

[Our newspaper report] San Francisco, 22nd broadcast, General Marshall announced: He went to Shanghai last weekend, his main task being to dispatch ceasefire supervisory groups to Xuzhou and Hancheng. Two teams of supervisory groups flew to their destinations on Sunday. Each team includes one representative each from the National Government, the Communist Party, and the US military.

[United News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd dispatch] Ambassador Walter and General Marshall met with Chairman Chiang for an hour today. It is widely believed that they discussed various methods to stop the continued occurrence of violations of the ceasefire agreement.

[United News Agency, Beiping, 22nd dispatch] The Military Mediation Executive Headquarters announced today that the headquarters received a request from the Communist Party and has dispatched a team from Shanghai to Guangzhou to enforce the ceasefire order. Other teams have safely arrived in Chifeng, Jining, Datong, Zhangjiakou, Jinan, and Xuzhou. Although headquarters has received reports from each team, there is no confirmed news as to whether the fighting has completely stopped in places where the war is still going on. The headquarters also announced that the mobile investigation team sent to the Jinan area to issue ceasefire orders is progressing very smoothly. According to a telegram report from American team member Colonel Lake, the team has met with senior military officers from both the Nationalists and the Communists several times in Tai'an. The two sides have now agreed to immediately cease the conflict, release prisoners, and repair the local railway. The team will soon proceed to Zhangdian, where conflicts are reported to be still occurring.

[United News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd dispatch] The Political Consultative Conference today elected eight representatives to participate in the military investigation team to investigate the implementation of the ceasefire situation in various places. Together with the eight previously elected, there are a total of sixteen people.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 21st dispatch] Zhou Binglin, professor of the National Southwest Associated University, resident member of the Political Participation Council, and member of the military inspection team elected by the Political Consultative Conference, arrived in Chongqing from Kunming the day before yesterday.

[Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 21st dispatch] The Northeast Security Command Headquarters issued a public notice on the 21st stating that the National Army has stopped conflicts in compliance with the ceasefire order and strictly ordered frontline troops not to fire a single shot. However, the Communist forces in the Rehe territory have been actively blockading all sides, which is even more active than before. (1) Lingyuan Nanjianchang has increased the Communist army by more than 5,000 people, besieging our Jianchang garrison. (2) About 10,000 Communist troops are gradually approaching our garrison 50 li northwest of Lingyuan. (3) Tianyi Railway Station has been occupied by the Communist army.

### President Song Meets with Reporters in Shanghai; Flies to Nanjing Today and Transfers to Guangzhou for Inspection; Government Resolves to Seek Sound Development of Shipping Industry

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd dispatch] After arriving in Shanghai, President Song is reportedly scheduled to depart from Shanghai to Nanjing on the 23rd, then fly to Guangzhou for inspection.

[Our newspaper report] In the "new," "fast," and "practical" construction of the country, Premier of the Executive Yuan, Song Ziwen, frankly explained the government's basic policies on supporting China's textile and silk industries and the policy of strengthening the use of ships during the recovery period at a reception for reporters yesterday. What Premier Song clarified was: "Since the government has established an economic policy of separating light industry from private operation, why has it organized the state-run China Textile Construction Corporation and the China Silk Corporation?" In addition, Premier Song also explained the importance of strengthening the allocation of ships and the government's measures to establish a sound sea and river shipping institution.

Premier Song has come to Shanghai three times after the victory. The reception held in the Bank of China Building yesterday was Song's first "group" meeting with reporters after returning to China, and it was also the first time he met with reporters in Shanghai after the victory. At the reception, due to time constraints, the questions raised by the reporters were limited to the three issues of textiles, silk, and shipping. A summary of Song's remarks: (1) The significance of the establishment of the China Textile Construction Corporation (see separate written remarks).

(2) Regarding the shortage of ships to cope with the recovery and construction period, President Song said: The government has organized a ship allocation committee to use a small number of ships to cope with a huge need. At the same time, it is using various methods to purchase ships from foreign countries so that coastal and inland river transportation can gradually become smooth. It has purchased 15 old ships from the Philippines and ordered 10 new ships from the United States. In addition, in order to quickly solve the shipping problem, it has leased ships from Jardine Matheson and Taikoo to transport relief supplies from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. In order to reflect the real situation, the government has approved these two companies to temporarily fly the British flag and sail on our coast and inland rivers. Although the abolition of unequal treaties does not allow foreign ships to sail on our coast and inland rivers, this measure is temporary. It is actually beneficial to our country and does not damage our overall sovereignty. Song also had great expectations for the future development of our country's shipping industry. He said: The government will have the ability to concentrate economic power in the future to gradually enrich the total number of our country's ships. President Song mentioned that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK Line) were established at the same time, but our country failed to develop the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company due to mismanagement, while the NYK Line has become a huge shipping institution in the world, which is deeply regrettable. Song said: Although the current situation is difficult, if we can work realistically in two or three years, we will definitely achieve the ideal goal and surpass the pre-war achievements of the NYK Line.

(3) Regarding the China Silk Corporation, the government also feels that 70% of China's silk industry has been destroyed during the war. Before the war, our country's silk industry did not seek progress in technology, and the quality of silk varied, and there was no fixed standard for the selling price in foreign markets, so it could not compete with Japan's raw silk export industry. The foreign raw silk market is mostly controlled by the Japanese. The government's initial organization of the silk industry company was based on promoting the spirit, and it specially hired silk industry expert Ge Jingzhong to preside over it, hoping to make an overall development plan for our country's silk industry. The government now plans to recover 5 million mulberry saplings from Japan and compensate for a large number of silkworms in order to restore our silk production industry. The organization of the China Silk Corporation is also transitional, with a term of two years, and at most it will be extended for one year before being transferred to private operation.

Song also introduced Mr. Ge Jingzhong to stand up and give a speech. Mr. Wan said briefly: The status of our country's silk industry in the international market has been seized by the Japanese, and we must take it back from the Japanese in the future. Before the war, Japan sold nearly 800,000 dans abroad annually, and the foreign exchange it earned was also the capital for its aggressive policies. The destruction of our country's mulberry fields and silk industry by the Japanese army in the past was planned. They wanted to destroy our country's entire silk industry and prevent China from becoming a silk-producing country again.

At the reception, a reporter asked: In the recovered areas, the enemy and puppets had forcibly collected a large amount of yarn and cloth from people during the occupation period. Should this yarn and cloth be returned? President Song replied: This is a legal issue, and it will be handled fairly after research. Another reporter asked: It is said that there is a black market for passenger and cargo transportation on various Yangtze River ships. Can the government take effective measures to eliminate this malpractice? Premier Song replied: This malpractice should of course be eliminated, but the current lack of ships makes it difficult to eradicate even if it is banned. The malpractice will be reduced as soon as the ships ordered from foreign countries arrive. Another reporter asked: Can we negotiate with foreign shipping companies to fly our national flag when sailing on our coast and inland rivers in order to respect sovereignty and correct the view? Song said: The borrowing of foreign ships this time is entirely to meet the needs of reality. We cannot ignore the problems of reality. Fortunately, our use of foreign ships is temporary. I hope we can endure it for the time being. Those who attended the reception yesterday included Peng Xuepei, director of the Executive Yuan's temporary office in Shanghai, Shu Yunzhang, general manager of China Textile Construction Corporation, Ge Jingzhong, general manager of China Silk Corporation, and more than 30 reporters.

### Gold Prices in Beiping Soar This Week; Break Through the 100,000 Mark; Few Transactions of Large-Denomination Rupees in Kunming

[Our newspaper, Beiping, 21st dispatch] Gold prices in Beiping have soared this week. After breaking through the 90,000 mark yesterday, the market continued to rise this afternoon, breaking through the 100,000 mark. The highest price reached 100,700 yuan per tael. The US dollar also rose to 1,480 yuan. Silver dollars also rose. Stimulated by this, commodity prices have also become firm. It is reported that the reason for the rise in gold prices is purely due to the surge in gold prices in Shanghai.

[Our newspaper, Kunming, 21st dispatch] After the Indian government banned the circulation of large-denomination rupees, there were very few rupee transactions in Kunming. There were almost no takers for large-denomination notes of 1,000 yuan or more. According to an estimate by a tycoon in the business community, the amount of rupees in circulation in Kunming is about 30 million yuan. If this law can be applied abroad, the financial community in Kunming will suffer a great loss.

### US Military Leftover Materials; We Are Cleaning Up and Receiving

[Our newspaper, Kunming, 21st dispatch] After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the US military left Kunming one after another. How many materials did they leave behind, and how many materials did we receive? This is a military secret, and outsiders have no way of knowing this mystery. However, various US military items can be openly bought in stores and on stalls in Kunming. In the mansions and private residences of some people, you can see US military supplies obtained without labor. Where do these things come from? It seems to have become an open secret. It is not known how many times the banning order has been reiterated or how many times it has been implemented, but the result is still useless. The eyes of the general public are focused on the reception work in the recovered areas. What went wrong can still be seen in the newspapers, but the actual problems in the rear areas are kept secret. According to a senior general, the materials left by the US military in Yunnan are like a drop in the ocean in the entire European Theater, but they are actually a large number in China. Our military authorities have recently set up an institution in Chongqing to take over the US materials and set up special commissioner offices in Yunnan, Guizhou, Hunan, and Guangxi. Special Commissioner Zhao, a lieutenant general, leads more than 100 experts, and has recently arrived in Kunming from Chongqing to begin clearing and receiving work, which is expected to be completed in about two months. People are placing great hope on this new institution.

[Our newspaper, Kunming, 21st dispatch] The US military in the Kunming area is tentatively scheduled to withdraw for the last time on the 25th of this month. There are only about 100 people left, mostly officers and soldiers from the Army Aviation Transportation Team, the Aircraft Repair Team, and the US Military Cemetery Registration Team.

### Improving People's Livelihood, Developing the Textile Industry: President Song's Written Explanation of the Significance of Establishing a Company

[This City's News] President Song, while receiving reporters yesterday, read aloud a written statement regarding the establishment of the China Textile Construction Corporation. The original text is as follows:

The government's economic construction policy has already determined that general light industries will be privately operated. Regarding the recent takeover of Japanese yarn factories, I originally advocated for private operation as well. However, after careful consideration by the government, it was decided to organize the China Textile Construction Corporation. Although the term is limited to two years, with a maximum extension of one year, some people outside the government still do not understand this. I am therefore providing a detailed explanation.

Japanese yarn factories in our country have a total of 1.75 million spindles, roughly equivalent to the number of spindles in our own domestic yarn factories. At the beginning of this takeover, the original intention was to immediately invite bids for sale and transfer them to private operation. However, because our businessmen are still suffering after eight years of arduous war and their economic strength has not yet recovered, it is feared that there would be few buyers at present. Moreover, the government would have difficulty estimating prices at once. Furthermore, the government must immediately restore production in the factories it takes over, so it is impossible to wait.

Currently, various private yarn factories operated by our own people in various places are experiencing difficulties due to a lack of working capital, and they are requesting loans from national banks. Therefore, even if someone were to purchase the factories, the government would still have to maintain them, which is equivalent to the government allocating funds to take over the operation itself. The national treasury would not receive a substantial income from the sale of the yarn factories.

Secondly, after World War II, all countries are experiencing a severe shortage of yarn and cloth, and prices are soaring. After World War I, our domestic [text missing] began to develop. The public [text missing] enthusiastically subscribed to yarn factory shares, almost to the point of frenzy. However, in the end, industrialists [text missing] control abilities, rushed ahead of one another, and did not understand the principles of supply and demand. As a result, the textile industry soon suffered a major setback. The current situation is similar again. The profits from operating textile [text missing] can double the principal, and the people who operate the textile industry do not have the strength to buy at this time. I ask, what obligation does the government have to sell these yarn factories to a few people with existing wealth and help them get rich? Based on the above points, the government has decided that after two years, when the economic situation has stabilized and the people's strength has recovered, all the equipment in the yarn factories can be re-evaluated at an appropriate price, and each yarn factory will be sold separately through bidding. This will be done on a unit-by-unit basis, based on the original organization of the Japanese yarn factories. There is also another method, which is to issue shares after each unit has been taken over and put into operation and the price can be estimated. The shares will be sold publicly to the public, and once more than 51% has been achieved, a shareholders' meeting will be convened to change the operation to private, with the government only in a supervisory position.

The above explains in more detail the reasons why the government is temporarily placing the yarn factories under state management. However, these are only passive reasons. There are also active reasons that deserve attention, so I will briefly describe them below:

The government must be responsible for improving the people's needs for food, clothing, housing, and transportation, the so-called four basic needs, and for raising and supplying the necessities of life. Yarn and cloth are [text missing] necessities of life, and the government must strongly promote the development of the textile industry.

Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, Japan's annual yarn and cloth market abroad was approximately US$300 million. The raw materials used were largely obtained from our country. Japanese textile groups certainly compete with each other in their own country, but they take unified action abroad. Whether in transportation, finance, or insurance, the government and various enterprise organizations form a unified entity, so the profits and losses are calculated as a whole, which allows them to achieve such success. Our country's textile factories have always acted independently in overseas markets. Although there are many of our compatriots in the Philippines and the South Seas Islands, and economic power is in our hands, our country has no position in the textile market, and it is entirely dominated by Japan. Now that the Japanese textile industry has been destroyed, there are many who are vying for its original market. The government has charged the China Textile Construction Corporation with leading the textile industry in the short term, and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and other Chinese shipping companies' overseas routes, national bank foreign exchange banks, and our country's insurance companies will jointly assist in order to obtain the Japanese's previous annual yarn and cloth market of US$300 million.

Finally, the textile machinery factories are extremely important. The China Textile Construction Corporation is now jointly taking over the relevant Japanese machinery factories with various textile factories, so that it can manufacture its own textile machinery. The initial plan is to be able to produce 250,000 spindles per year and 6,000 automatic looms within one or two years. In the future, our country's textile machinery needs can be supplied domestically, and the foundation of our country's textile industry can be established.

In summary, the government has put a great deal of effort into organizing the China Textile Construction Corporation, and all of this is factual. It is definitely not something that can be broadly criticized with simple slogans of state-owned or private operation.

### British Troops Remaining in Java and Greece: Soviet Representative's Severe Condemnation; Aimed at Retaliatory Measures Against Iran's Appeal; This Action is Akin to Throwing a Bomb at the United Nations General Assembly

[United Press, London, 22nd] The Soviet Union's formal condemnation of the situation created by the presence of British troops in Greece and Indonesia has complicated the workings of the United Nations organization today, and whether the "Big Five" in the new council can unite has passed its first test. British and American officials held hasty meetings in the early morning regarding this sudden action by the Soviet Union, but no formal response has been found. From a diplomatic standpoint, the Soviet action can be seen as a form of retaliation against Iran's appeal to the Security Council, which occurred within hours of the resignation of the Tehran government. If a more pro-Soviet government is established in Iran, Iran's proposal may end sooner rather than later. In addition, this action occurred hours before Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky was expected to arrive in London, and his tardiness had aroused all kinds of speculation. Soviet delegation acting head Gromyko submitted a written proposal to the Security Council requesting that the United Nations organization take action on the Greek issue, and Ukrainian chief representative Manuilsky also submitted a written request for the United Nations organization to take action on the Indonesian issue. Gromyko stated that the current presence of British troops in Greece has become a method of exerting pressure on the domestic political situation in that country, and Manuilsky accused British troops and "Japanese enemy troops" in Indonesia of taking action against the local population. The Soviet side believes that the situation in both places threatens the "maintenance of peace and security." A senior British official believed that the Soviet action was a counter-action against Britain's support for Iran, but expressed doubt as to whether the Soviet Union could obtain the necessary majority in the Security Council, namely the support of seven member states. If the Soviet Union fails to achieve this, it will not be able to place the Greek and Indonesian issues on the agenda. The Soviet action has further complicated the urgent issue of the Security Council's election of a Secretary-General of the United Nations organization, as this requires the unanimous agreement of the "Big Five," which has not yet been achieved. The eleven members of the Security Council held a formal discussion on this issue yesterday, but no agreement was reached, and another informal meeting is scheduled. The Security Council has not met since the Iranian issue was raised. It is expected that a formal meeting will be held when the "Big Five" hope to reach a consensus on the election of the Secretary-General.

### British Cabinet Convenes Emergency Meeting; Byrnes Postpones Return to Country

[This Newspaper News] According to London broadcasting on the 22nd: The British Cabinet convened an emergency meeting this afternoon to discuss the Soviet Union's protest to the Security Council against the presence of British troops in Greece and Indonesia. British Prime Minister Attlee stated that the Soviet move was completely unexpected by the British government. According to the Greek Prime Minister, the presence of British troops in Greece was with the full consent of the Greek government. It is said that the Security Council has scheduled a meeting for Thursday to discuss the Soviet protest.

[United Press, London, 22nd] The nature of the issue raised by the Soviet Union is slightly different from the Iranian issue. Iran raised an issue concerning itself to the United Nations organization, but the issue raised by the Soviet Union is not directly related to itself. However, according to Article 5 of the Charter, the Soviet Union has the full right to raise the above-mentioned issue to the United Nations organization, because that article stipulates that "any member of the United Nations" may bring "any dispute or situation" to the attention of the Security Council or the General Assembly. The initial reaction of officials of the United Nations organization here is that opposition to British policy in Greece is stronger and more forceful than opposition to British policy in Indonesia, and they point out that the presence of British troops in Indonesia is in accordance with the orders of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who went there to conduct the handover of the Japanese army. However, even with the orders of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the British action has been met with extremely severe criticism worldwide. It was impossible to contact Security Council Chairman Makin this morning to hear his views. His office announced that he had gone to the British Foreign Office for a meeting, which is believed to be in consultation with Foreign Minister Bevin. At the same time, the U.S. delegation also met this morning to discuss the various issues facing the United Nations organization. U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes was originally scheduled to return to Washington on Thursday, but now it is feared that this will not be possible.

### Five Arab Countries Will Also Make Demands: Security Council Encounters Another Difficulty

[This Newspaper News] London broadcasting on the 23rd: The Security Council, which is in turmoil, will encounter a fourth difficult issue in a row in three days.

### French and South African Mandated Territories Should Be Transferred to Trusteeship: New Zealand Representative Advocates

[United Press, London, 21st] New Zealand Prime Minister Fraser today requested in the United Nations organization Trusteeship Committee that France and South Africa immediately transfer their mandated territories to the United Nations Trusteeship Council, and that the two countries' hesitation to declare the transfer of their mandated territories to the United Nations is incomprehensible. Regardless of its legal status, morally speaking, no country has the right to abuse its trust land. It must be known that the mandated territory does not belong to the mandating country. Previously, French Foreign Minister Bidault had declared on Saturday that France would consider transferring its mandated territory to the United Nations, but only with the consent of representatives from French and French mandated territories Cameroon and Togo, and a trusteeship agreement would be drawn up. The French Guinea representative told the committee today that France wanted to incorporate Cameroon and Togo into its territory, and representatives from both places are now assisting in the formulation of the new French constitution. Fraser therefore immediately demanded that France clarify its intentions. South Africa has also expressed its intention to incorporate the former German territory of Southwest Africa into the Union of South Africa, and Fraser declared that any attempt to annex the mandated territory would render international obligations a scrap of paper. Although legally unclear, morally, these countries should agree to transfer their mandated territories to the current United Nations Trusteeship Committee.

### Italy Requests to Retain its Colonies

[Reuters, Rome, 22nd] Italian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister De Gasperi addressed the Art Council yesterday, saying that Italy should be allowed to retain Trieste, South Tyrol, and some of its colonies. He advocated resolving the Adriatic Sea issue based on the Wilsonian principles of 1919, which advocated dividing the Istrian Peninsula into two parts, east and west. The western part, including the ports of Trieste, Pula, and Koper, should belong to Italy, and the eastern part, Fiume, should belong to Yugoslavia. Italy retained the Brenner Pass border for economic and strategic reasons. Italy will be generous to the minorities within its territory. De Gasperi also said that Italy had the right to retain its colonies, especially Eritrea, which should be governed by itself, but should also accept the military control of other countries. De Gasperi opposed the US proposal to confiscate Italian property abroad as compensation.

### New Developments in the Iran-Soviet Affair: Hakimi Cabinet Resigns En Masse, Iranian Parliament Considers New Prime Minister Candidates

[Reuters, Tehran, 22nd] Following the resignation of Iranian Prime Minister Hakimi, the Iranian Parliament is scheduled to convene a special session today to consider candidates for the new prime minister.

[Reuters, London, 23rd] The Iranian delegation formally requested the UN Security Council to investigate the Iran-Soviet dispute. In less than 24 hours, Iranian Prime Minister Hakimi and his entire cabinet suddenly resigned, causing a new turn in the Iran-Soviet affair. Our correspondent in Tehran reported yesterday that Prime Minister Hakimi claimed, after submitting his resignation to the Iranian King on Sunday night, that the Iranian issue had been submitted to UN agencies for handling, and he was satisfied and resigned. Since the end of the Azerbaijan rebellion, Hakimi has repeatedly attempted to contact the Soviet government through the Soviet Embassy in Iran, but to no avail. A few weeks ago, he requested permission to fly to Moscow to negotiate with the Soviet government, but was also unsuccessful, so his resignation was expected. The following three individuals are considered most likely to succeed as prime minister: Erte Nai, a major landlord in northern Iran; Mansour, the governor of Khorasan Province; and former Prime Minister Binia. The resignation of the Iranian cabinet may prevent the nascent UN organization from being immediately subjected to a major test. If the new Iranian government is willing to hold out-of-court negotiations, it can formally withdraw its appeal to the Security Council. The Security Council held an informal meeting yesterday afternoon to study the most appropriate way to deal with the Iran-Soviet dispute. Given that the Iranian government has already resigned, it seems unnecessary to make a decision too early.

[Reuters, London, 22nd] Moscow Radio broadcast: The autonomous government of Azerbaijan in northwestern Iran has established a Ministry of Commerce and Finance to establish trade relations with foreign countries and to determine the necessities of the population.

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 21st, United Press] TASS news: Commercial relations between northern Azerbaijan and other areas of Iran, as well as foreign countries, have been completely severed. Azerbaijani merchants are now requesting the autonomous government to directly establish economic relations with foreign countries. From a geographical point of view, the government may trade with northern Turkey, but the Turkish government will not be enthusiastic about this.

### Hungary's Lispe Oil Fields Occupied by Soviet Troops

[United Press, New York, 21st] "The New York Times" today carried a report from the Hungarian capital stating that the Red Army has occupied the Lispe oil fields in Hungary, including the largest oil field of the Socony Vacuum Oil Company. A few days ago, the Soviet side ordered its own geologists to work in the oil fields, excluding the general manager of Socony Vacuum Oil Company from the site, but the crude oil extracted is still refined using the Socony Vacuum Oil Pipeline Company's refinery, and the Soviet Union pays the expenses. This move by the Soviet Union shows that it intends to extract oil from the oil fields to the greatest extent possible, regardless of whether the oil fields will be depleted in the long run, as it expects the Red Army to eventually withdraw from Hungary.

### Over Fifty High-Ranking Bureaucrats in Charge of Japanese Internal Affairs Dismissed, MacArthur to Investigate Financial Conglomerate Regulations Today

[United Press, Tokyo, 21st] Before Japan's surrender, senior bureaucrats of the Ministry of Home Affairs and governors of various prefectures had formed a political clique controlling the internal life of the country. More than twenty such governors and thirty-three senior officials of the Ministry of Home Affairs have resigned due to MacArthur's purge of politics. The Ministry of Home Affairs was almost an all-powerful institution in Japan, controlling the salt and tobacco monopolies of various prefectures, as well as all public buildings. Even the 93,000 police officers were under its control. Local governors did not have to be local residents, but were selected and dispatched from Tokyo. The new Minister of Home Affairs, Mitomi, will follow MacArthur's orders to eliminate the old and introduce the new, and plans to select commoners and vice-ministerial level officials who have no past misconduct to serve as major prefectural governors. All those over the age of sixty will not be selected. It is said that Mitomi is considering several merchants and former members of parliament who previously had no say in the government.

In addition, all questions relate to the relationship between the parent company and its associated or subsidiary companies. The fourteen Zaibatsu investigated by the headquarters are Mitsui, Miyazaki (Mitsubishi Heavy Industries), Sumitomo, Yasuda, Kawasaki, Uesano, Iwasaki (aircraft industry), Shibusawa, Furukawa, Okura, Nomura, Noguchi, Aikawa (Manchurian Heavy Industries), and Okouchi.

### British Church Plans to Establish an Organization for Modernized Evangelism, Utilizing Advertising, Film, and Wireless Broadcasting; Total Cost Under $4 Million

[United Press, London, 21st] The Archbishops and Bishops of the major churches of England are planning to establish a permanent organization for modernized evangelism. A preliminary report on a five-year campaign has been submitted, which will utilize various modern propaganda institutions to engage in evangelism, publish Christian advertisements in newspapers, screen religious short films in cinemas, and broadcast religious news through wireless radio, in order to turn the whole country to Christianity. The total cost of this campaign will be no less than four million US dollars. According to the report, although there is no lack of opposition to the church's use of advertising, given the current state of Christianity, it is imperative to take concrete action. Only by utilizing the best art and skills to glorify God and serve God can the church reach the countless people who crave spiritual power. It is estimated that this campaign will require 200,000 English pounds per year, equivalent to 100,000 US dollars, but it should be developed gradually. Only a fraction of this amount needs to be spent in the first year. As for how to raise this money, it should be approached through prayer and detailed consideration from all aspects. However, the truth that there has never been a lack of necessary financial assistance in promoting spiritual cultivation should also be taken into account. To achieve the best results, it will take years, but repeated advertising will give readers time to reflect. According to a spokesman for the Church Union, today's world is in the age of science, and everything will evolve into scientific terms. However, scientific progress will eventually have its limits, and when it hits a wall, religion will revive as a result. At this time, a truly organized church can enjoy its benefits. If the Archbishops and Bishops agree to establish a permanent evangelistic organization, any form or method can be adopted. The outline includes prayer, propaganda, regional meetings held by church liaison groups, and newspaper advertisements and pamphlets on selected topics. However, this is only one aspect, and there are many other methods. The approach may first focus on religious facts, or establish images of the Lord, or answer questions, or use a higher level of philosophy. All of this remains to be determined.

### French Reform Party Unwilling to Compromise, New Government Stillborn, Communist Party Nominates Gouin as Presidential Candidate

[Our Report] According to a London broadcast on the 23rd, the French Constituent Assembly decided today after several hours of discussion that the new head of France will be elected at 3 p.m. on the 23rd, replacing General de Gaulle.

[Reuters, Paris, 22nd] The French Progressive Catholic Party has refused to form a government with the Communist Party and the Socialist Party to replace the one led by de Gaulle. The Communist Party then asked the Socialist Party to form a two-party government with a Communist Party member as the head of government. The leaders of the three parties engaged in intense political activity all day yesterday. Progressive Catholic Party leader and Foreign Minister Bidault said after meeting with Communist Party leader Thorez, "I am not a prophet, but I believe we will soon have a three-party government." As for who will form the new government, the final decision may not be known until after the French Constituent Assembly meets this afternoon. The majority of leaders of the Progressive Catholic Party are unwilling to serve in a three-party government led by a Communist Party member. Yesterday afternoon, General de Gaulle left his private residence in Neuilly and drove to a hunting lodge in the Forêt de Marly outside Paris. His letter of resignation was published yesterday. It said, "I have decided to retire because France is no longer in a state of emergency. I hope the succeeding government will complete the task of ensuring the destiny of our country."

[United Press, Paris, 22nd] The Communist Party today resolved to nominate the President of the National Assembly, the Socialist Gouin, to succeed General de Gaulle, who resigned yesterday, as the head of the coalition government formed by the three major parties in France. The Communist Party originally intended to form a government with its leader Thorez, but was opposed by the Socialist Party and the People's Republican Movement, so it issued this resolution. The National Assembly is scheduled to meet at 3 p.m. today, and it is expected that no firm agreement will be reached between the parties before this afternoon. A plan has been drafted to have the National Assembly pay close attention to de Gaulle's formal resignation, and then adjourn to await resumption tomorrow. This morning, the executive committees of the Socialist Party and the People's Republican Movement held meetings in preparation for convening a joint meeting of the Communist and Socialist Parties this afternoon. In addition to Gouin, the name of Auriol is the most prominent among the candidates for the coalition government. Some political parties, mostly conservatives and right-wing members, advocate the election of former Prime Minister Herriot to succeed de Gaulle. Herriot arrived here this morning by train from Lyon. He said he would attend the Radical Party meeting in order to review the overall situation. The Socialist Party refused to form a purely left-wing government with the Communist Party alone, and insisted on organizing a coalition government of the three major parties. The People's Republican Movement refused to participate in a government led by the Communist Party. To break this deadlock, the only option is to organize a three-party coalition government with a Socialist Party member acceptable to all parties as the leader.

### France Strives to Restore Perfume Production and Sales

[Reuters, Paris, 23rd] More than 1,300 French perfume manufacturers are currently striving to restore their export business despite various technical and raw material difficulties. In peacetime, the French perfume industry employed approximately 20,000 workers and earned an average net profit of 400 million francs per year. During the German occupation, perfume exports were severely restricted, but due to soaring prices, the sales volume was still quite large. Currently, all perfumes are subject to a 25% luxury tax, and sales are still widespread domestically, especially in areas where American troops are stationed. It is said that since the liberation of Paris, there have always been many American soldiers queuing in front of the Chanel perfume store to buy the famous Chanel No. 5 perfume. An ordinary bottle costs about 400 francs. Another perfume that is popular among American soldiers is "Christmas Night" from the Caron factory, which currently sells for 2,000 francs per bottle, compared to only 300 francs in 1938. Several new brands of perfume have now appeared on the Paris market, priced quite high, but their names have not yet been heard overseas.

### Truman Consults with All Parties on Methods to Resolve Labor Strikes

[Central News Agency, Washington, 21st Special] After the US steelworkers went on strike, Truman and congressional leaders met at the White House this morning, but no temporary solution has yet been found. Today, they are considering using the wartime emergency powers that have not yet ended to have the government take over the striking factories. According to the above method, the workers in each factory will resume work under government supervision, pending continued arbitration and final resolution.

[United Press, Pittsburgh, 22nd] After the US steelworkers' strike, approximately 1,300 steel mills, aluminum mills, and ore plants in 29 states have been shut down, and the national railways and public utilities are also beginning to feel the impact today.

### Our Request for Increased Relief Funds from UNRRA May Not Be Granted

[United Press, Washington, 21st] The UNRRA's (United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) budget for this year has reached $3 billion, but countries ravaged by war are still making requests to the agency, and their voices cannot be ignored. This is especially concerning to Americans, as the additional funds will mostly be requested from the United States. Of the $3 billion budget, Americans have already contributed over 70%, but most of this money has not yet been collected and will require continued appropriation requests in Congress. Although the agency has already received a large amount of money, it still feels that supply cannot meet demand. Currently, the largest amount of UNRRA relief is for China, totaling $67.5 million, which will be used for relief in the next fifteen months, not including reconstruction needs. However, even this amount is not enough to meet the urgent relief needs in China, so it has requested the agency to increase it to $97.5 million. According to officials of the China branch, according to this example, the amount of funds received by China is far less than other afflicted countries, which is contrary to the principle of fairness. Take Italy as an example, its population is only one-tenth of China's, yet it receives $40.9 million. UNRRA officials do not deny that China's needs are enormous and that its request for an increase has a very strong moral force. Unfortunately, the budgets of all countries have been drafted by international experts, and the difficulty lies in the fact that funds are insufficient for distribution. From the current situation, it seems difficult for China to obtain another grant from UNRRA. Agency officials are even concerned that China may not be able to fully absorb the 3 million tons of relief supplies, because its domestic distribution system is unsound and it seems unable to absorb the full amount.

### Ten Thousand US War Brides to Be Transported from England to the US by the End of February

[United Press, Frankfurt, 21st] The US military authorities announced today that by the end of February, approximately 10,000 US military war brides and their children will be transported from England to the United States. There are sufficient ships available for this purpose. The first batch is scheduled to depart from Southampton on the Argentina on January 28, carrying approximately 625 people. The Queen Mary is scheduled to set sail on February 2, carrying 2,400 people. In addition, there are seven more ships that will take US military brides to the US in February. Currently, there are no less than 50,000 brides and their children waiting for transportation, including those from France, whose departure dates have not yet been determined.

### American Merchant Returns from China, Discusses the Future of Sino-US Trade, Prospects for Commercial Revival in China, Current Need for Cotton Textiles is Especially High

[US Information Service, Salt Lake City, 21st] American merchant Mr. Colbert, who recently returned to the United States after inspecting commercial conditions in Shanghai, recently told Mr. Young, a well-known writer on Far Eastern affairs, that the future of Sino-US trade is very bright, and he predicted that the commercial revival of China will make Shanghai the most attractive and important commercial center since it was opened as a port. Less than three months after the end of the war, Mr. Colbert's first shipment to Shanghai was 25,000 dozen handkerchiefs. He said that after the inflation on December 2 last year, prices rose to their peak. Now that rice, wheat, and cotton have been transported to various ports in central China, the price of goods, which was originally three to ten times higher than prices around the world, has fallen by two-thirds. Goods hidden in warehouses for up to four years, fearing being seized by the Japanese, are now being sold off by their owners. This is because they believe that once American ships arrive and the source of imports increases, prices will inevitably fall further. According to export merchants, the price of food produced in China this year can be stabilized, and the price of imported goods can return to the standard price level around the world by the end of this year or earlier. Cotton mills have been closed due to a lack of fuel and proper equipment. Once a large amount of American cotton is transported to China in accordance with the UNRRA program, they can resume operations. Various cotton fabrics and blue denim will play an important role in Chinese commercial activities. Mr. Colbert does not share the pessimism of some foreign merchants, who fear that the abolition of extraterritoriality in China will reduce the special rights enjoyed by foreign merchants in China for nearly a century. As for trade in Hong Kong, he said that recovery is expected if the port can be detached from the sterling bloc. He believes that the British will restore their position in the insurance and shipping industries. Mr. Colbert predicts that commercial recovery in North China will be slower, as the political situation there is still unstable, so it will take time for Tianjin to regain its position as a commercial center.

### Military Action in the Haifa-Yafa Area

### Pre-War New Ireland Was Snail-Free, Now They Are Everywhere in the Fields

[United Press, Sydney, 21st] The gardens of New Ireland, Australia, were snail-free before the war. Now they are everywhere, numbering in the millions, damaging flowers and vegetables and causing great harm. However, these snails have become a treasure for the local Japanese, who eat them as a supreme delicacy, either stir-fried or braised. The Japanese claim that these snails were dropped by American pilots to destroy vegetable gardens, but Australian reporters say that they were either brought in by the Japanese themselves by boat.

### Local Correspondence

Suzhou Award for Informing on Secret Sales of Military Supplies: The Suzhou Receiving Group of the Special Commissioner's Office of the Beijing-Shanghai Region of the Military Department has specifically announced an award for informing on secret sales. Regulations for dealing with the secret sale of military medical supplies stipulate that anyone who knows of people hiding, secretly selling, or purchasing enemy or puppet military medical equipment can report it to the group, regardless of the status of the perpetrators.

Changshu: Association Requests Allocation of Flour: The Changshu Post-War Relief Association, given the arrival of winter and the urgent need for relief for the poor, and in addition to providing porridge and lending winter clothing through the Winter Relief Association, has investigated the number of poor people in the county and submitted a request to the Suzhou-Ningbo Branch of the Post-War Relief Administration for an allocation of flour for relief. Furthermore, the county's warehouses have been located at the Da Shun Factory and Hu Tai Factory outside Xiaodongmen, with very convenient land and water transportation.

Wuxi: Japanese Prisoners of War Concentrated for Management and Training Before Being Sent Back to the Beijing-Shanghai Region: Ma Yiming, Director of the Wuxi Japanese Prisoner of War Management Office, stated that for the convenience of managing and training the more than 15,900 Japanese prisoners of war under his jurisdiction in Wuxi and Changzhou, 20 concentration camps have been established in Wuxi and 8 in Changzhou. He also received orders to transport all Korean soldiers and Japanese military police officers and soldiers among the Japanese prisoners of war to Shanghai for separate concentration, awaiting ships to send them back. Director Ma, knowing that the Japanese prisoners of war would be leaving Wuxi for Shanghai, specifically convened the Japanese military police yesterday morning for a lecture, proclaiming the true meaning of democracy and the virtues of our country's supreme commander, which deeply moved the Japanese prisoners of war.

Chief of the Fifth Precinct Prosecuted for Neglect of Duty: Zhou Qiruo, former Chief of the Fifth Precinct of this county, along with Zhao Qi, Inspector, and Deng Junchen, Police Chief, were investigated and prosecuted by the court's prosecutor's office for neglect of duty and bribery. Several interrogations were conducted, and Hua Peigen and You Zixin, two tea servants involved, were arrested. Chen Zhongwu and thirteen other police chiefs and officers of the precinct were also summoned for strict interrogation. Zhou Qiruo admitted to accepting bribes of 200 million puppet currency. Chief Judge Ma concluded the investigation and filed a public prosecution with the criminal court according to the seventh clause of Zhou's regulations.

Changzhou: Supervising Envoy Inquires About the People's Livelihood in His Hometown: Cheng Zhonghang, Supervising Envoy of the Jiangsu District of the Control Yuan, arrived in Changzhou from Wuxi on the 20th with Gu Ruo and three other police officers. This was Cheng's first visit to Changzhou as part of his inspection of the control area. In addition to the heads of various agencies, dozens of relatives and friends welcomed him at the station. After entering the city, Cheng went to his former residence in Huajiaoyuan and met with reporters at 4:00 PM, inquiring about the general state of the news media since the restoration, the local military discipline, whether the reorganized police force still had the style of the occupied period, the issue of traitors, and whether there were any cases of malicious accusations. Cheng stated that this time, his visit to Changzhou revealed that many local people were pessimistic, and that the suffering after the victory had not yet been alleviated. He hoped that the military, police, and judicial departments would work together to redress grievances and alleviate the burdens of the people. He also mentioned that in Suzhou, the director of tax donations, Da Fa, had been handed over to the county jail and transferred to the court. In Wuxi, the people were actively reporting corruption. He felt that the supervisory system, if carried out with the spirit of the war of resistance, would definitely be effective. Someone suggested that a secret supervisory network be established to exercise authority through "lightning strikes," a suggestion that Cheng found quite agreeable. He scheduled a symposium for all sectors of society at the County Chamber of Commerce on the morning of the 21st to inquire about the people's livelihood.

Qingpu: County Dispatches Troops to Confiscate Weapons from Security Corps: After the victory in this county, the first County Chief Wang, recognizing the many roaming soldiers and bandits in the suburbs who were committing robberies, established the Qingpu Security Corps. Since its establishment, due to the complex composition of the corps and the lack of training, it not only did not help but also led to repeated robbery cases in the countryside, which came to the attention of the superiors. Therefore, on the 15th, he dispatched the Second Battalion of Infantry, led by XX, to Qingpu, using swift and decisive means to disarm the entire corps. On the morning of the 18th, all the soldiers were escorted to the division headquarters in Kunshan.

Qingdao: Central Bank Exchanges Puppet United Reserve Bank Notes: The Qingdao Central Bank began exchanging puppet United Reserve Bank notes on the 15th of this month. However, because few people in the city were aware of it, there was not a large crowd seeking to exchange. Furthermore, since various banks in Qingdao had already been handling the deposit of puppet currency converted into legal tender, many merchants deposited the puppet currency at various banks. In addition to the Central Bank, the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Farmers Bank of China, Trust Bureau, Exchange Bureau, Shanghai Bank, Continental Bank, Guohua Bank, Industrial Bank, Jin Cheng Bank, Donglai Bank and other banks and bureaus were entrusted to handle the exchange separately. The denominations exchanged were all 100 yuan or more. If counterfeit banknotes were found, the exchange agency would immediately stamp them as void and not exchange them. If the holder of the notes was suspected of mixing counterfeits, they would be handed over to the judicial authorities for investigation. The exchange period was limited to four months from the start date, and all notes would be invalidated after the deadline. A total of twelve exchange agencies handled the exchange, and the total amount exchanged on the 15th alone was over 310 million yuan.

### Amidst the Voices of Liberation in African Mandated Territories: The Scenery of Cameroon Enters the Painting, "Dark Continent" Has Become a Historical Term

— Special Article from the Newspaper Archives

Dr. Wellington Koo, Chief Representative of China to the United Nations General Assembly, delivered a speech to the United Nations General Assembly on the 16th of this month, hoping to establish a Trusteeship Council. He said: The trusteeship system is a progressive improvement compared to the mandate system. The trusteeship system can accelerate the political, economic, social, and educational development of the people in the mandated territories, so that the wish to establish self-governing governments and achieve independence can be realized at an early date, and tens of millions of people under mandate will benefit.

The day after Ambassador Koo delivered the above speech (the 17th), British Foreign Secretary Bevin announced at the United Nations General Assembly that Britain had decided to transfer the African mandated territories of Tanganyika, Cameroon, and Togoland to the United Nations organization for trusteeship, and to make Transjordan an independent state. The entire audience responded with enthusiastic applause. This move by Britain can be regarded as the most wise and frank measure taken by a member state of the United Nations to date. In other words, Britain has taken the lead in implementing the obligations imposed on member states by the United Nations Charter to administer non-self-governing territories. We believe that this is a ray of light for the governed peoples to enter a bright world from the dark ages.

The Situation of Mandated Territories Voluntarily Abandoned by Britain

After the First World War, most of Germany's colonies in Africa were mandated to Britain, totaling four: (1) South West Africa, mandated to the Union of South Africa, (2) Tanganyika, (3) Cameroon, (4) Togoland. The mandated territories that Britain is preparing to abandon and transfer to the United Nations organization for trusteeship are the three places other than South West Africa.

### Tanganyika

Located south of Kenya in Central Africa, with an area of more than 940,000 square kilometers, it is the majority of the former German East Africa. After the First World War, it was divided between Britain and Belgium, and in 1921 it was mandated to Britain by the former League of Nations. From then on, the East Africa and South Africa territories held by Britain were linked together. This area is located on the east side of the Great Rift Valley, with many large lakes and volcanoes. The land has been gradually developed, and agriculture and animal husbandry are thriving, especially the rich forests. Before the European War, the Germans meticulously managed this area, building a transcontinental railway from Dar es Salaam to Ujiji on the shores of Lake Tanganyika, and had ambitious plans to extend it to Cameroon and South West Africa to traverse the entire African continent, in order to compete with the British transcontinental railway.

The majority of the inhabitants of Tanganyika are Bantu natives, with a total population of over five million and 16,000 Europeans. It is governed by a governor, with two councils, executive and legislative, below. Dar es Salaam is the capital of Tanganyika, with a railway to the shores of Lake Tanganyika, which is the starting point of the transcontinental railway. Mombasa to the north is a good coastal harbor, with bustling merchants, and a railway to the shores of Lake Victoria, making it the gateway to East Africa. The northwest corner of the area is administered by Belgium and merged into the Belgian Congo. The products include tropical products such as coconut oil, rubber, cotton, coffee, and sugar, tobacco, etc., but the climate is unfavorable and development is not easy. Ujiji is on the shores of Lake Tanganyika. In 1871, explorers Livingstone and Stanley met here, and since then it has become famous throughout the world.

### Cameroon

Located between Nigeria and French Equatorial Africa in Central Africa, with an area of more than 350,000 square kilometers, it is an important area of the former German West Africa. In 1916, it was seized from Germany, and three years later it was divided between Britain and France. The majority was mandated to France, and the area bordering Nigeria was mandated to Britain, with an area of 80,200 square kilometers. In 1922, it was handed over to British mandate, with a population of less than one million, and was concurrently administered by the Governor of Nigeria. Cameroon has fertile land and lush forests, producing rubber, palm, ivory, etc. Coconut and coffee cultivation is particularly thriving. In the basin of the Cameroon River, there are endless mineral resources, but due to the harsh climate, it has never been successfully developed.

In the interior of Cameroon, there are many Catholic priests, mostly from Northern Europe. They often travel in and out of black villages under the attack of heat and epidemics, engaging in missionary work.

### Togoland

Located between the Gold Coast colony and French Dahomey, with an area of more than 32,000 square kilometers, it was originally occupied by Germany. In August 1945, the Germans surrendered unconditionally. After the First World War, it was divided between Britain and France, with Britain administering the west and France administering the east. France owns the coastline and also has a larger area. The area under British mandate has a population of less than 500,000 and is concurrently administered by the Governor of the Gold Coast. The port of Lome in Togoland faces the Slave Coast, and cultural progress is slow. This area produces diamonds, but they are generally prohibited from being exported overseas. Local natives often take diamonds wrapped in cloth and peddle them to passersby on the street. Originally, the diamond mines in the area were designated, and the stones produced by the designated mines were prohibited from being bought and sold, so diamonds from outside the designated mines freely roamed the streets. In order to seek profit, many Jewish diamond merchants went to Daoli to buy cheap and good quality diamonds from the local natives.

### Characteristics of Africa

Large deserts, large forests, sweltering heat, plagues, jungles, and wild beasts are the characteristics of Africa, hence it is known as the "Dark Continent." Apart from the only republic of Liberia, the rest of the area has been divided by the world's powers. However, in recent years, the culture of advanced countries has gradually been instilled, and at the same time, there are more and more railways, transportation has become more convenient, and the knowledge level of the natives has gradually increased. The so-called "Dark Continent" has become a historical term. This time, Britain first demonstrated its wise virtue by abandoning the mandate and transferring it to the United Nations organization for trusteeship, which has a significant impact, at least in the sense of liberating the African people. It is believed that other countries administering non-self-governing areas will follow Britain and resolutely abandon their mandated territories and place them under the United Nations Trusteeship System.

### Visiting the Gunpowder and Sulfur Authorities: Zheng Zuya Discusses Control Policy Issues

— Zi Ming

Gunpowder and sulfur are the main raw materials for national defense industries, and their uses, such as armaments, mining, and road construction, cannot be done without gunpowder and sulfur. As for its types, such as nitric acid and sulfuric acid, they are even necessary for general chemical industries. The government's policy on the management of gunpowder and sulfur is also of concern to the community. I recently heard that the General Administration of Gunpowder and Sulfur of the Ministry of Finance has moved its office from the capital city to Shanghai. Therefore, the reporter visited Zheng Zuya, Director of the Gunpowder and Sulfur Administration, at 1361 Xinzha Road. The following is a summary of the conversation:

Who Governs Gunpowder and Sulfur?

Q: Gunpowder and sulfur are raw materials for armaments. Why are they under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance?

A: Before 1932, gunpowder and sulfur were under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Military Affairs. At that time, because the areas producing native gunpowder in our country were quite extensive, the nitrate salt produced as a byproduct of gunpowder production was often purchased and consumed privately by producers and the people, which was not only unhygienic but also greatly hindered the income of salt taxes. The former Minister of Finance, Song, in order to increase the revenue of the national treasury, requested that the gunpowder and sulfur industry be placed under the administration of the Salt Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Finance.

Importance Issues

Q: Regarding gunpowder and sulfur in the military industry, some people in the community have said that the manufacture of modern national armaments has evolved from black gunpowder to smokeless gunpowder and other organic explosives. The past direct use of gunpowder and sulfur to formulate gunpowder has become a relic in the history of explosives. Has gunpowder really lost its importance in the military industry? What is the actual situation?

A: Black gunpowder and organic explosives, as substances, both have their appropriate uses in the military industry. It cannot be said that because explosives with high explosiveness have been invented, explosives with low explosiveness should be completely abandoned. Moreover, the manufacture of organic explosives mostly uses nitric acid and sulfuric acid as the main raw materials. Our country's manufacturing of nitric acid still lacks fixed gas equipment and must be sourced from saltpeter (i.e., nitrate). And the manufacture of sulfuric acid cannot be done without sulfur. The original materials of organic explosives still cannot be separated from gunpowder and sulfur, but they go through a series of transformation procedures. Other uses, such as the assembly of bombs and shells using T.N.T. explosives, also require the use of gunpowder and sulfur. It is estimated that from 1937 to 1944, the supply of gunpowder and sulfur for military manufacturing, the construction of airfields, the construction of fortresses, and the construction of highways in the Northwest, Sichuan-Shaanxi, Sichuan-Hunan, and Yuexi, and the Xiang-Gui, Qian-Gui, Shi-Tian, and Zhuan-Jiang railway projects, as well as the mining of Jiangxi, Hunan, and Wuxi, the dredging of the Yangtze River, the Wujiang River, and other rivers, the repair of engineering projects, and the general supply for ordinary civil use, totaled approximately 400,000 dan of gunpowder and approximately 270,000 dan of sulfur. The required quantities are not small, indicating that gunpowder still maintains its importance.

Wartime Policies

Q: What are the important policies for controlling gunpowder and sulfur?

A: The government's policy on gunpowder and sulfur, in terms of business, is naturally based on the principle of self-reliance and self-sufficiency, in order to avoid losses! However, the important purpose is not to increase tax revenue, but to strictly control it, so that national defense industries and private enterprises can be properly coordinated. Therefore, the evolution of the control policy is in response to the situation, in line with the times, in order to make progress. Analyzing its evolution process can be summarized into two stages: wartime and peacetime:

(1) Wartime Policy: Since the outbreak of the war, the original sulfur-rich areas of our country, such as Hebei, Shandong, and the eastern Henan and northern Jiangsu areas, have been occupied by the enemy. Foreign gunpowder and sulfur products cannot be imported due to the blockade of the seaports. At the same time, the needs of military industries have increased sharply compared to before the war, and because military use is urgent, the amount used cannot be estimated in advance. For a time, the supply of gunpowder and sulfur products could not meet the demand, which was very difficult. Therefore, effective measures were adopted to develop reserves and actively increase production in the southwestern provinces, implement official procurement, and control materials. For gunpowder and sulfur factories, a method of lending gunpowder and sulfur raw materials was adopted to enable manufacturers to free up cash and develop their business as soon as possible. Sales were also made on behalf of businesses at public expense to prevent capital accumulation, which was aimed at supporting factories. On the one hand, the product was able to reduce costs, stabilize prices, and provide relief to users who used gunpowder and sulfur as raw materials, in order to develop the national defense industry. Therefore, during the War of Resistance Against Japan, the gunpowder and sulfur industry was able to increase gunpowder and sulfur production and supply military needs, and there was never a shortage. During the wartime policy, the following five key tasks were adopted: (1) development and production, (2) centralized materials, (3) supply to the military industry, (4) stable prices, and (5) adjusting surpluses and deficits, which achieved this effect.

Peacetime Policies

(2) Peacetime Policy: Our country's gunpowder and sulfur resources, in terms of nitrate production, do not have nitrate mines like those in Chile. Most of them are extracted from the ground or from the walls of cliffs and caves, using nitrate-bearing soil as raw material. The nitrate content of every 100 catties of soil is only 1% to 3%. The resources existing in the natural world are not abundant. In terms of sulfur production, there are no natural mines like those in the United States and Italy. Most of them are extracted from sulfur-containing pyrite, lead ore, zinc ore, and antimony ore, and most of them are byproducts of various mines, which is far from the output of natural mines. In terms of gunpowder and sulfur types, such as nitric acid, sulfuric acid, gas acid, and potassium compassion, the factories are just emerging and the scale is not large. In terms of technology, it is also relatively backward, so the finished products are of poor quality and high price. Compared with the industrialized countries of Europe and the United States, they are even more dwarfed. During this period, foreign goods with good quality and low prices were transported and sold to our country's market. Domestic products were bound to be completely bankrupt, which would not only greatly affect our country's established industries, but also make entrepreneurs hesitate to start factories in the future, hindering the development of the country. In order to address the shortcomings of the times, the government should give priority to the use of domestic products and do its best to maintain the original production. On the one hand, it encourages the improvement of emerging technologies and subsidizes efforts to create modern chemical plants, so as to catch up with imported goods that are good quality and low price. It is permissible to reverse the entire downward trend and be self-sufficient. For example, the cost of the raw material for domestic matches, potassium chlorate, is currently more than 100,000 yuan per city dan, while the selling price of foreign goods, including shipping costs, is only about 50,000 yuan. If the government does not find a way to provide relief and maintain them, not only will all the original factories close down, but no one will dare to try this kind of construction project. The market will be permanently occupied by imported goods.

Political Consultative Conference Snippets: What I Saw at the Seventh Conference: Special Chongqing Airmail Report from This Newspaper: Zhao Haosheng

On the morning of the 17th, the National Government Auditorium was used for the presentation of credentials by the French Ambassador, and the Consultative Conference was rescheduled to 3:00 PM in the afternoon.

Zhang Junmai is Radiant

Zhang Junmai arrived in Chongqing on the afternoon of the 16th to attend the Seventh Conference. He was wearing a yellow woolen suit, a red tie, and rimless glasses, and his face was radiant. He shook hands and exchanged greetings with the members in the lounge. When speaking, he first reported that because he waited for four days for a plane in Paris and two days in Cairo, he was six days late, and he apologized to everyone.

Deng Yingchao's Speaking Style

Deng Yingchao's speech was the first time that the voice of a female member was heard in the entire hall. The vocabulary and grammar in her speech were entirely in the style of "Mao Zedong's Proclamations."

Zhang Bojun and Ta Kung Pao

In order to prove the opinions of the non-party on the National Congress, Zhang Bojun read the editorial of Ta Kung Pao in the hall. Chuan Sinian and Wang Yunwu, who were on the non-party seat, sent notes to Hu Lin, saying, "What a loyal reader!" Hu Lin stood up and said in his speech: "Reading Ta Kung Pao, you cannot think that we oppose any issue with one or two editorials."

Qian Xinzhi Talks About Shanghai Representatives

Qian Xinzhi said: "There are eight representatives from Shanghai to the National Congress, four of whom are not Kuomintang members." Mr. Shao Lizi said: "This is the best explanation."

Zhang Dongsun Causes a Storm

Zhang Dongsun was careless in his words and involved newspaper reporters, causing a major storm. All the reporters protested jointly, and he publicly apologized at the conference. (18th)

Scope of Control

Q: What are the types of gunpowder and sulfur control?

A: The types of gunpowder and sulfur control that have been approved by the National Government include potassium nitrate (i.e., potassium nitrate, saltpeter, or saltpeter), sodium nitrate (i.e., Chilean nitrate or sodium nitrate), calcium nitrate (i.e., calcium nitrate), ammonium nitrate, strontium nitrate, silver nitrate, sulfur (i.e., sulfur, also known as sulfur), potassium chloride (i.e., potassium chloride or potassium chloride), potassium chlorate and potassium chlorate, perchloric acid salt, nitric acid (i.e., nitric acid), sulfuric acid (i.e., sulfuric acid), red phosphorus (i.e., red phosphorus), white phosphorus (i.e., yellow phosphorus), acetylene compounds, trichloroethyl chloride, explosive acid salts, picric acid salts, etc., more than twenty types.

However, the scope of gunpowder and sulfur control should be based on the principle of including all explosive materials. Today, science is changing rapidly. New items are constantly being invented, and the scope of gunpowder and ore control should also be expanded at any time.

Q: What are the management methods for gunpowder and sulfur?

Management Methods

A: The management of gunpowder and sulfur can be divided into two methods.

(1) The management of gunpowder and sulfur is based on the principle of civil manufacturing, official procurement, and official sales. In the production area, the land for centralized production should be selected, the people should be supervised to manufacture, and the public should uniformly give prices for official procurement, so as to transport and sell to the sales area. In the sales area, in addition to official sales, it can also be divided into areas and contracted out to contractors, but all materials are still uniformly handled by the public, with the aim of supporting domestic products.

(2) The management of gunpowder and sulfur products is based on the principle of commercial manufacturing and official sales. The sales method is that after the gunpowder and sulfur products have been inspected by the public, the public can distribute them on behalf of the business and sell them freely, with the aim of facilitating business and benefiting the people.

### Snapshots of Robinson, the American Representative of the Mediation Executive Headquarters

Mr. Robinson, Chargé d'Affaires of the American Embassy in China, has recently been appointed as the American representative to the Three-Person Committee. This committee was established to enforce the ceasefire order between the Nationalists and the Communists.

Mr. Robinson arrived in China in May of last year, serving as Economic Advisor to the American Embassy. In September, when Hurley and Angell returned to the United States to report on their duties, Mr. Robinson was appointed Chargé d'Affaires.

Mr. Robinson is from Virginia in the southern United States. During World War I, he served as a pursuit plane pilot. He studied at the Hargrave Military Academy and the College of William & Mary in Virginia, and also graduated from the American Institute of Banking, majoring in banking, economics, and commercial law. During World War I, Mr. Robinson graduated from the American Air Service flying school in Alabama.

In 1922, at the young age of twenty-eight, Mr. Robinson was already the Vice President of Virginia's largest bank, the "National Bank of Commerce," and the "Richmond Trust Company." Mr. Robinson was a leader in numerous commercial, civic, and charitable organizations in Virginia.

In December 1942, Mr. Robinson was hired by Stettinius [then administrator of the Lend-Lease program] to work on wartime emergency projects for the U.S. government.

In January 1945, Mr. Robinson accepted an appointment from the U.S. Department of State. He remained in Washington D.C. for several months, carefully studying Chinese affairs. In April of the same year, he accompanied the Secretary of State to the San Francisco Conference, allowing for further discussions before heading to Chongqing.

Mr. Robinson is married with two daughters and one son, all studying in the United States. [U.S. Information Service, Peiping, 21st]

### Marshal Smiles... Scenes from the Chongqing慰勞 Meeting...

Marshal Marshall, the special envoy, attended a ball in Chongqing held by various circles to慰勞 Allied soldiers on the evening the ceasefire order was issued, where he was surrounded by Chinese and foreign university students who asked for his autograph.

Until the ink in his pen ran out, falling-petal-like business cards and banknotes continued to be sent to him.

A foreign girl in a black velvet evening gown took out a cloud-white silk handkerchief and asked him to sign it. Marshal smiled.

He said, "What a beautiful handkerchief! I can't bear to write on it!" The young lady begged him like she was pleading with her grandfather, and the old marshal finally wrote his name on it with a smile.

An American boy, seeing that the ink in Marshal's pen had run out, gave him his own pen to use. In the end, he forgot to take it back. As a result, Marshal raised the pen and asked loudly, "Whose pen is this?" [Zhao Haosheng, sent from Chongqing on the 18th]

### Reader's Opinion

To the Editor: I am writing to you, a loyal admirer of your esteemed newspaper, known as the highest mouthpiece in the Southeast, for its frankness and impartiality. The plight of civil servants during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War is truly lamentable, and I trust your newspaper will express its sympathy. Now that the war has been won, I wish to use your prestigious platform to call for assistance. Enclosed is a manuscript, which I respectfully request to be published for public viewing. By Chen Zeguang, Kunming, 35th year, 元 (first month), 10th day.

A guest asked me: You are fond of the ancients. I wish to cite ancient sayings and use them to illustrate present-day events. Can you do this? I replied: Please, go ahead.

The guest said: I have heard it said that one who rides in another's carriage bears another's troubles, one who wears another's clothes shares another's worries, and one who eats another's food dies for another's cause. Are there such people today? Please explain this. I replied: This is easy to prove; I have seen it, the civil servants are such people.

The guest angrily said: Why do you consider civil servants to be so noble? I do not know about the civil servants of ancient times, but I have seen those of today. There are those who are useless, those who are ignorant, and the sounds of singing and revelry are often heard from them, and their traces are often seen in brothels. Some even abuse their power to oppress the people and enrich themselves, and their waste of public funds and use of private cliques are seen and heard everywhere. Have you not seen this? Why do you consider civil servants to be so noble!

I said: These are just bad elements! How can they be considered among the ranks of civil servants? Just as birds have owls and beasts have cruel beasts, so too do humans have good and bad. I would not stop talking about birds because of the owl, thus abandoning the excellence of the phoenix, nor would I stop talking about beasts because of the cruel beast, thus discarding the virtue of the unicorn. Therefore, when talking about humans, how can we forget the merits of civil servants because of the bad elements? The virtuous and the unworthy are unrelated. The strength of the nation is used to gather the elite of the people, and after more than ten years of cultivation and training, and dozens of trials and selections, they are given positions when they are learned enough and have the talent. In terms of quality, they are also valuable! Since our country entered the path of politics, civil servants have generally been able to fulfill their duties and be loyal to the country. Whether it is politics, education, the military, finance, agriculture, or industry, none of them have not contributed to the effort of civil servants to move toward the norm, and to have today. Although there are differences in the size of positions and the height of talent and virtue, their dedication and effort are the same. The state has gained so much, and the reward is only salary. In terms of merit, they are also admirable! After the Anti-Japanese War, China, weak as it was, resisted the strong leadership of Japan for eight years and finally succeeded. When the triumph of the war was not yet a reality, who dared to say that it would be successful? Only civil servants were able to maintain their original intentions and persevere in their vows, falling and rising again, dying and being resurrected, have you seen this? The government moved its capital, following and supporting it from beginning to end, who were not civil servants? They racked their brains to propose and implement political reforms, were they not civil servants? They endured hardship and propagated the national culture, educating students, without warm clothes and not full bellies, were they not civil servants? They expanded transportation, planned finances, worked hard in transportation and production, were they not civil servants? They supervised the army and went to the front, sweating and bleeding, abandoning their heads and fighting for every inch of land, were they not civil servants? I have also seen civil servants participating in the construction of airfields. When they were rushing to complete the work, they often could not sleep for nights, their faces were haggard and their eyes were red, yet they rushed around the airfield, trying to win a moment to complete it in order to respond to military needs. When the sirens sounded and enemy planes suddenly arrived, guns and bullets crossed, and death was everywhere, they were in as much danger as if they were on the battlefield, and were spared death by a hair's breadth many times. Have you heard of this? Civil servants are able to be so loyal to the country, can it not be said that they are loyal?

The guest said: What you say is indeed true, but I still have doubts in my heart that have not been resolved. Since civil servants are so loyal to the country, then what the country should give civil servants, in my opinion, should be that those who should ride in carriages should be given carriages, those who should wear clothes should be given clothes, and those who should eat food should be given enough to eat. But what I have heard is that those who should ride in carriages are walking; those who should wear clothes are in rags; those who should eat enough are hungry; those who have parents are panting and waiting to die; those who have children are abandoning their studies and standing like cranes; clothes cannot cover and hide their bodies, and their complexions are those of starvation; as the years warm, their children cry of cold, and as the year is plentiful, their wives cry of hunger; the hair is mottled and turns white, and the teeth shake and fall out. Is it not a loss to the country that their families are short-changed? Or is it that their heads hang low and they work hard, dedicating themselves to the country, and are rewarded in this way, and you are indifferent to it? Now that the country has achieved victory and become one of the four powers, like the flourishing of grass and trees, full of vigor and vitality, and at a time of renewal, even for those who invest and profit, there is concern about their bankruptcy and a plan for relief, but civil servants are neglected! Victory bonuses, civil servants do not participate in. The right to be elected, civil servants do not participate in. At a certain time, grain is given, at a certain time, salt is distributed, at a certain time, uniforms are issued, at a certain time, supplies are given, but only mentioned in announcements, and rarely seen in reality, is it possible to quench thirst by looking at plums, and is it possible to fill hunger with a painted cake? Those whom you call glorious civil servants have recently been ordered to have their salaries reduced and their staff reduced. Is it that civil servants who are loyal to the country have not done their best? Or should those who do their best be demeaned? Is it that the state's bright vision cannot reach? In a country with justice, poverty and lowliness are shameful. Beset by poverty and lowliness, they only want to die. The goal of civil servants' efforts is to seek shame and death, which is why I do not understand! Can you teach me?

I said, yes. A gentleman is concerned with the way, not with poverty. In the past, Zigong met Yuan Xian, who regarded poverty as a disease, and Yuan Xian reproached him. What you see today is like Zigong. Those who chase after gambling and are greedy and unworthy are the illness of civil servants; those who are beset by hunger and cold and whose clothes are tattered are the poverty of civil servants. The sick are difficult to cure, but the poor are easy to change. Civil servants can establish themselves and act righteously, and save the country from crisis, thereby turning defeat into victory, this is the responsibility of civil servants. Poor treatment and inadequate compensation are the responsibility of the state. The state has policies, just as the family has rules. Trustworthy rewards and definite punishments are the power of the state, and the urgency of implementation depends on the strength of the state, and then follows. Now that our country is just rising, there are many urgent matters, and the payment of compensation is not the most urgent. Civil servants should only know to fulfill their duty of utmost loyalty, and need not quibble about the one way of compensation. Although civil servants are the pillars of the state and share its fate, the state cannot allow civil servants to be impoverished and die, just as civil servants cannot allow the state to fall and perish. Now that our country has overcome a strong enemy and is striving for renewal, as if emerging from a secluded valley and moving to a tree, escaping from a dangerous road and walking on a smooth road, I believe that the central government will soon improve the treatment of civil servants to stabilize them, and will never allow them to fall and perish, losing their vitality. And in the future, the circumstances of civil servants will rise day by day with the national strength, their lives will be enriched with the national economy, and their fame will rise with the national fortune, and it will not only be a matter of relief, it can be called glory, and it is not a false statement. As for the reduction of staff and the reduction of administration, it is also a matter of national policy. Reducing it here and supplementing it there, transferring duties, what harm is there? Therefore, what I am concerned about is whether civil servants are competent, whether they are honest, not about the thickness of their compensation. Confucius said: "Do not worry about not having a position, worry about how to stand; do not worry about not being known, seek to be worthy of being known."

The guest rejoiced and laughed and said: Hearing your words, the cowardly are courageous, the weak stand up, there are no rebellious children in the family, and there are no rebellious people in the country, and my doubts are dispelled. I will no longer criticize the many with the few, the long with the short, or the virtuous with the unworthy, and I will watch with a new eye to see your words come true. I should congratulate myself, then congratulate the civil servants, and even more congratulate the country! (Chen Zeguang)

Editorial

### Economic Freedom for All of Humanity

The war aims of the Allied or United Nations side in this Second World War were roughly as follows: (1) As far as China is concerned, at least the restoration of territorial and administrative integrity as it existed before 1895; (2) As far as the United Kingdom is concerned, the restoration of the independence and freedom of the small countries of Europe (this is the language of British wartime Prime Minister Churchill), and the attainment of the safety of human society (post-war social security should be a new goal in life, to replace pre-war private profit or profitism, if unemployment still occurs after the war, leaving workers without economic security, dictatorship is bound to arise again - this is the gist of the speech given by the current British Foreign Secretary Bevin to the Rotary Club of London in November 1940); (3) As far as the United States is concerned, the attainment of the Four Freedoms for Humanity of the late President Roosevelt, and the Seven Freedoms for Humanity of the former Vice President Wallace.

The Four Freedoms for Humanity of the late President Roosevelt of the United States are: first, freedom of speech; second, freedom of worship; third, freedom from want, that is, freedom from poverty, unemployment, and economic dislocation; and fourth, freedom from fear, that is, freedom from external aggression. The Seven Freedoms for Humanity of former Vice President Wallace are: first, freedom from fear of unemployment; second, freedom from fear of old age and destitution; third, freedom from fear of disease and hunger; fourth, freedom from class struggle among industrialists, businessmen, farmers, and workers; fifth, freedom from fear of overproduction of necessities leading to bankruptcy and panic; sixth, freedom from racial and religious strife; and seventh, freedom from excessive government interference with the personal thoughts and inventions of the people. Wallace believed that what humanity urgently needs in the world today are these seven freedoms. With these seven freedoms, humanity can enjoy peace and happiness forever. Otherwise, the future of humanity is mostly tragic.

Of the aforementioned Four Freedoms for Humanity called for by the late President Roosevelt of the United States, the third is economic, and the fourth is half economic. Now it has been nine months since the day of Germany's surrender, and it has also been five months since the day of Japan's surrender. Has the freedom from want already been obtained by the victorious nations? (The defeated nations will not be discussed for the time being.) We must admit "not yet." Again, has freedom from fear been obtained by the various countries? Because the problem of international control of atomic energy has not yet been satisfactorily resolved, we must again admit "not yet"; and it seems that the psychology of the people of various countries is even more afraid that the use of new weapons such as atomic bombs will ruthlessly destroy human civilization completely.

As for the Seven Freedoms for Humanity put forward by the former Vice President Wallace of the United States, the first five are all about economics. Since the unconditional surrender of Germany and Japan, have the people of the world, regardless of whether they are victors or losers, already obtained these five economic freedoms? We can again answer bluntly and domestically: "Not yet." However, the fifth freedom, freedom from fear of overproduction, is generally not a problem for most countries in the world except the United States. Because they are currently in the aftermath of war, devastated, desolate, and fundamentally have nothing to do with overproduction. However, after the restoration of vitality in the future, perhaps there will be a problem of overproduction again, just as it was staged during the world economic panic around 1930.

In fact, all human beings have a desire for survival. The cause of war lies in seeking the survival of the people of the belligerent countries, and the end of war and the restoration of peace also lie in seeking the continued survival of the people of the belligerent countries (regardless of victorious or defeated countries). As for the constant research, discussion, and advocacy of plans for a permanent peaceful society by philosophers and scholars throughout history, their purpose is also to seek the survival of humanity, that is, what the national father Sun Yat-sen called the Principle of the People's Livelihood. (The so-called Principle of the People's Livelihood is the principle of "the people's livelihood, the survival of society, the people's livelihood, and the life of the masses.") If the Principle of the People's Livelihood can truly be fully realized in all countries of the world (not just China), then the five kinds of human economic freedom and security called for by Wallace above (in fact, security and freedom cannot be separated, without security there is no freedom, and without freedom there is no security) will naturally not be a problem. There is no fear of unemployment, no fear of old age and destitution, no fear of disease and hunger, no fear of class struggle, and no fear of overproduction of necessities leading to bankruptcy and panic among producers.

However, the various post-war chaotic phenomena that are presented to our eyes in various parts of the world are actually imbalances and frictions within the inevitable transitional period from the mobilization state of the wartime period to the demobilization state of the peace period. After the unprecedented catastrophe of the Second World War, mankind must learn from its pain and think of all kinds of ways to avoid the even more tragic and more immense sacrifices of the Third World War (because the Third World War must be an inhumane atomic energy war). We must think of all kinds of ways to obtain the Four Freedoms or Seven Freedoms of mankind - especially the five economic freedoms and security. We must think of all kinds of ways to realize the ideal realm and the Principle of the People's Livelihood of the Great Harmony World.

Standing in the position of a citizen of the Republic of China, we must also make up our minds to strive to realize the National Father's Principle of the People's Livelihood at home and abroad. This will be our greatest and most effective contribution to domestic permanent peace and to world permanent peace.

From these perspectives, we must not only implement doctrine, but we must also implement the principle of livelihood at the same time. But there are many people who only know how to shout empty "democracy" slogans, while neglecting the "people's livelihood" principle, which is the most important spirit of the Three People's Principles. Even the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party say that they do not oppose capitalism, in an attempt to win the favor of private capitalists. Is this not extremely strange? We dare to remind everyone that if the eyes of politicians in China - and even the world - do not focus on the majority of ordinary people in the future, and single-mindedly plan for the economic freedom that they should obtain - that is, the freedom from want that the late President Roosevelt called for - and realize the happiness of people's livelihood that they should enjoy, even if the call for "democracy" is sung loudly, it will be difficult for the world to have permanent peace, and mankind will not be able to obtain the happiness of co-existence and co-prosperity. Therefore, we are willing to specially put forward "economic freedom" when people only know how to echo the fashionable term "democracy," and ask politicians to pay attention!

### Over Five Thousand Unemployed Workers Petitioned the Municipal Government Yesterday; Deputy Mayor He and Others Provided Detailed Explanations, Hoping for Mutual Understanding, Mutual Love, and Labor-Capital Cooperation

Approximately five thousand unemployed workers from various factories in Shanghai, representing sixty-two units, marched on Nanjing Road and other locations on the morning of the 22nd. At noon, they went to the Municipal Government to petition. They sent twenty-three representatives to meet with Mayor Qian, but the mayor was attending a meeting at the Songhu Garrison Headquarters due to official duties. Deputy Mayor He and Secretary-General Shen received them on behalf of the mayor, and invited Special Commissioner Zhang Zi from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Fan Caiqiu, the Organizing Committee Member of the Shanghai General Labor Union, Zhao Banfu, the Chief Secretary of the Shanghai Unemployed Workers Relief Committee of the Ministry of Social Affairs, and Zhou Xuexiang, the Chairman of the Shanghai General Labor Union, to participate in a meeting with the representatives in the Municipal Government conference room.

Deputy Mayor He Responded to Each Item

Deputy Mayor He spoke first, saying that he had read the petitions from each unit and would provide detailed replies to the requests related to the Municipal Government's jurisdiction. He would ask Special Commissioner Zhang and Chief Secretary Zhao to respond separately to matters under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Economic Affairs or the Ministry of Social Affairs. Subsequently, he listened to the representatives' statements, which generally expressed the hope for a swift resumption of work, the priority hiring of original workers when factories resume operations, requests for relief for unemployed workers, and permission for unemployed workers to organize labor unions. Deputy Mayor He responded to each of the requests from the petitioning workers, providing detailed explanations, stating that the gradual resumption of work in the factories was the fundamental solution. Currently, the focus was on providing swift and widespread relief to unemployed workers. Regarding the distribution of flour from the Relief Goods Relief Administration, he had heard that the Shanghai Unemployed Workers Relief Committee of the Ministry of Social Affairs would distribute over three thousand bags daily in the eastern district and over one thousand bags daily in the western district, starting from the 20th of this month, and would continue to increase the area of distribution in the future to broaden the relief efforts. Regarding the issue of resuming work and prioritizing the hiring of original workers, he asked Special Commissioner Zhang to respond to everyone. In short, the government cared deeply for the workers and was particularly concerned about the unemployed workers. He sincerely hoped that factories could resume operations in the shortest possible time, and that unemployed workers would receive widespread relief before the resumption of work in various factories. Then, under the principle of mutual understanding and mutual love between labor and capital, cooperation should be implemented to increase various production and strive for local construction.

Priority Hiring is a Matter of Course

Following Deputy Mayor He, Special Commissioner Zhang Zi from the Ministry of Economic Affairs replied, stating briefly that the issue of resuming work for unemployed workers in Shanghai was not only a matter of urgency for everyone but also for the government. The gradual closure of factories in the city due to insufficient electricity began during the period of the Japanese occupation of Shanghai and had been occurring for two years. After the victory of the War of Resistance against Japan on August 10th of last year, the central government gradually took over the factories in Shanghai. From the date of the takeover on September 18th to October 11th, efforts were made to resume operations. However, due to the difficulty in obtaining coal, cotton, and tobacco, it took time to comprehensively plan. The priority hiring of original workers in each factory was a matter of course. Factories to which factory directors had been appointed were currently preparing to resume operations. However, some factories had been transferred to the management of other agencies and were not within the scope of the Ministry of Economic Affairs; this should be discussed separately. Subsequently, Zhao Banfu, the Chief Secretary of the Shanghai Unemployed Workers Relief Committee of the Ministry of Social Affairs, provided a detailed explanation of the procedures for distributing flour, hoping that the regulations would be followed so that unemployed workers could quickly obtain widespread relief.

Zhou Xuexiang, the Chairman of the Shanghai General Labor Union, then expressed his views, promising to take responsibility for resolving the difficulties of unemployed workers. Representatives from over sixty units selected seven representatives to maintain close contact with the General Labor Union. The representatives dispersed at 3:00 PM.

Resumption of Work to be Discussed This Morning

At around 4:00 PM, Special Commissioner Lu Jingshi arrived to persuade and guide the workers. The workers requested a loan for one month's salary, which could be deducted after resuming work. Zhou Xuexiang agreed to forward the request to the Office of the Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Economic Affairs for verification. As it was late, and no one was working at the Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, he instructed the worker representatives to persuade the workers to go home first, and promised to negotiate the requests, in addition to those already answered by Deputy Mayor He. He hoped that the worker representatives would nominate representatives to continue discussing the resumption of work and relief measures this morning with Lu Jingshi, the Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Social Affairs, and relevant authorities from the Social Bureau, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Municipal Party Headquarters, and the General Labor Union. By 7:30 PM, the representatives conveyed the authorities' opinions, and the heads of each unit then dispersed.

Five Injured During the March

It was reported that the petitioning workers yesterday were from sixty-two factories, including Shanghai Industrial, Shanghai Iron and Steel, Donghua, and Gongxing, in Hongkou, Yangshupu, which were originally operated by enemy merchants. Since the victory, they had not resumed operations, and the unemployed workers had set out to march, passing through Yulin Road, Dalian Bay Road, Pingliang Road, and Daming Road. Upon reaching the Garden Bridge, three wine bottles fell from a tall building, injuring five workers: Shen Binggen, Gu Hengsheng, Zhang Daoliang, Shen Jingfan, and Cheng Dexi, from factories such as Yongbei, Toyota, and China Soap.

Most of the Requests Largely Resolved

Finally, Wang Guangqing, Lu Jingshi, Zhao Banfu, Fan Caiji, and Zhou Xuexiang convened worker representatives to discuss the results. Most of the conditions proposed by the workers were resolved: (1) Resumption of work: a seven-person committee will assist the Ministry of Economic Affairs in deciding on acceptance, and a solution can be obtained in two weeks. (2) Hiring of old workers: worker representatives will maintain order in the factories, and priority hiring will be given. (3) Relief: flour can be distributed within four days.

### Shanghai Demonstrations Not Related to U.S. Military

U.S. military headquarters announced yesterday: The U.S. military has officially received a letter from the Chinese government, clearly stating that the various student parades and demonstrations, worker strikes, etc., held in Shanghai have nothing to do with the U.S. military. Their main purpose is not to deal with the U.S. military, and they hope that the U.S. military will not misunderstand.

### Over 200,000 Spindles in Enemy-Owned Cotton Mills to Begin Operations After Takeover

[Reported by this newspaper] Since the establishment of the China Textile Construction Corporation, directly under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, in Shanghai, it has gradually taken over enemy-owned cotton mills in the city, and has now largely completed the process. The number of spindles in operation is around 260,000. These cotton mills were previously managed by the Textile Group of the Office of the Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Economic Affairs in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Region. Now that its mission is completed, it is beginning to wind up. However, since most of the original operating personnel possess technical expertise and experience, China Textile has decided to hire them as much as possible.

### The Total Number of Registered Enemy Crimes Exceeds 20,000

Since the District Court Procuratorate began registering enemy crimes in early November of last year, the number of cases has reached 21,813 as of the 21st of this month. In order to regulate the registration order, the office has issued numbers, with a maximum of 600 people per day. However, the numbers are issued every thousand people. Currently, the number for February 23rd has been issued. Among the registered crimes, "wanton destruction of property" is the most common. Victims can go to Penglai Road in Nanshi to identify enemy criminals. Today, more than ten people will identify them for the first time.

### The U.S. Congressional Study Group Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday from North China; Scheduled to Leave for Manila Tomorrow

[United Press, this city] A five-member U.S. Congressional study group and its staff arrived in Shanghai yesterday by plane from North China. The mission of this group is to investigate the situation of the U.S. military in various places, study the disposal of surplus overseas materials, U.S. military demobilization, and Pacific naval bases. According to the group's representative, Bates: In October of last year, Okinawa Island was hit by a hurricane, causing severe damage. Naval experts therefore do not intend to use the island as a naval base to avoid further wind disasters. Japanese troops are being repatriated, and during this period, it is hoped that there can be mutual understanding and unity in China. For the sake of world peace, China should not have another civil war. Japanese people in China are now being actively repatriated, and it is hoped that the U.S. military stationed in China can be demobilized and return home within four to five months. Colonel Weidman is currently responsible for repatriating the Japanese. It is said that there are currently 185 U.S. Liberty-type transport ships and landing craft, driven by Japanese, constantly sailing to Japan to transport Japanese people back to their country. By the end of March of this year, the number of Japanese returning home can reach 25,000 per day. The presence of the U.S. military in China is stabilizing. The four representatives of this country believe that if the U.S. government is determined to occupy Pacific bases to form the outer perimeter of the United States, the United States may try to make these islands self-sufficient. When the group arrived at the airport, those who went to welcome them included Admiral Kirk, commander of the U.S. Seventh Fleet. The group is now scheduled to leave for Manila tomorrow morning, the 24th, after which they will meet again with Kirk and General Weidmeyer, and the time has also been arranged.

### Fang Zude's Case is Rescheduled for Retrial; Denies Serving as a Translator

[Reported by this newspaper] Fang Zude, who formerly served as a driver and translator for the enemy gendarmerie in Wusong, is alleged to have used the power of the enemy and puppet regime to forcibly purchase the house of Wang Deqin, a local resident. After the victory, he was arrested by the authorities on charges of treason and transferred to the court, and Wang also wants to recover the property according to law. The case was once tried, and the defendant denied oppressing the villagers and serving as a translator. Because Wang Deqin did not appear, the court ordered that the hearing be postponed. At 10:00 AM yesterday, the case was reopened by Judge Liu Yugui. Wang Deqin appeared in court and narrated how Fang borrowed the name of the enemy gendarmerie to forcibly purchase the house. When questioned, the intermediary Wang Hesheng claimed that Wang Deqin first wanted to sell the house, and then he contacted Fang, so the transaction was completed, not a forced purchase. Subsequently, Zhu Yongkang, the defendant's lawyer, submitted Fang's driver's license, proving that Fang was not employed as a translator, and attached a letter of guarantee from the joint businesses and residents of Wusong Town, proving that Fang had not exploited the villagers in the past. The court ruled that the recovery of property was not under the jurisdiction of the criminal court. Wang Deqin can file a lawsuit in the civil court of the District Court, and a joint hearing will be held again on the afternoon of the 25th. Also, this morning, the case of Zou Zhigao, a traitor, will be heard.

### China's Representative to the International Labor Conference, Zhu Xuefan, Returns to Shanghai

Zhu Xuefan, China's representative to the Paris International Labor Conference, arrived in Shanghai by military plane at 7:00 PM yesterday, accompanied by Deng Fa, and Ms. Li Pei, the secretary. Chen Jiakang, the representative to the London World Youth Conference, and others also came along.

### Wu Kaixian Returns to Shanghai

Wu Kaixian, the newly appointed Director of the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, went to Chongqing a few days ago on official business to pay his respects to the central authorities and make requests. It is now learned that Wu has completed his official business in Chongqing and flew back to Shanghai yesterday. He will take office at the bureau soon.

### Factories Moving Inland Request Hu Xiyuan to Stay in Shanghai

The members of the Joint Association of Factories Moving to Sichuan, Hunan, and Guangxi, who have come to Shanghai, have recently heard that Hu Xiyuan, the Director of the Committee of the National Industrial Restoration Association of China, will be flying to Peiping soon. They have successively requested Hu to postpone his trip. Yesterday, the Board of Directors of the Association decided to write to Hu to postpone his trip to Peiping, because the restoration of factories in Shanghai and various follow-up measures require Hu to preside over them in Shanghai. It is heard that Hu may postpone his trip to Peiping.

### Wang Xiaolai Appointed President of the Three Teachings Moral Society

The Three Teachings Moral Society was founded in the ninth year of the Republic of China. Recently, in order to expand its affairs, Wang Xiaolai was invited to serve as president. Wang took office at the society at 2:00 PM yesterday.

### Passengers Traveling to Qingdao Must Have Vaccination Certificates; Health Bureau Sends Out Vaccination Teams

Since the entry into spring in this city, the weather has been erratic, resulting in abnormal phenomena. Therefore, smallpox is very prevalent. The health authorities attach great importance to this and are actively launching an epidemic prevention campaign. They have dispatched 100 medical and technical personnel to organize mobile vaccination teams to provide free services to citizens. The shipping industry in this city has received a notice from the Qingdao shipping administration that passengers landing in Qingdao from now on must have vaccination certificates. Without such certificates, they will be refused landing.

The Wusong branch of the Shanghai Port Quarantine Station resumed work on the 16th. Imported ships with contagious diseases are all inspected. Because two foreign ships from Seattle have recently discovered smallpox, Yangtze River sailors, except those who have been vaccinated recently, must be vaccinated.

### The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to Postpone the Collection of Deed Tax in This City to Reduce the Burden on the People in the Recovered Areas

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance yesterday regarding the postponement of the collection of deed tax in this city: "The above briefly states that the detailed rules for the implementation of deed tax in this city were formulated in accordance with the regulations on the management of deed tax in the recovered provinces and cities promulgated by the Executive Yuan. However, deed tax is a central tax and should be collected by the Direct Taxation Bureau, which is completely separate from the cleaning up of land rights in this city. Now the Land Administration Bureau is holding it at the same time as the first land ownership registration, which easily causes misunderstandings among the people, and the registration fee and the relatively high deed tax are paid at the same time. For deeds established during the period when this city was occupied, if they are valued in counterfeit currency, the deed tax should be collected according to the price estimated by the Land Administration Bureau, up to 200 times the price estimated by the pseudo-Land Administration Bureau for 30 years, which makes people even more afraid. Since the Land Administration Bureau began processing land registration on November 19th of last year, those who have applied for registration have not been very enthusiastic. The biggest reason is that the land registration in this city has been hindered by the Land Administration Bureau's implementation of the detailed rules for the management of deed tax, proving that Article 22 of the Outline of Land Administration Implementation Procedures in various provinces and cities stipulates that "during the registration period, unregistered white deeds should be allowed to report taxes on a deferred basis and should be exempt from penalties," and Article 7 of the Interim Measures for Handling the Registration of Permanent Lease Deeds or Tao Deeds in this city stipulates that the attention is purely on reducing the burden on the people in order to promote the completion of the land administration implementation procedures. From the perspective of encouraging land registration, it is appropriate not to collect deed tax in this city. Furthermore, in order to show consideration for the people's economic suffering during the war, the government has explicitly ordered the exemption of land value tax and land tax for one year in the 34th year. There is no reason why the purpose of the Land Law cannot be exempted together. In summary: (1) In order to reduce the tax burden on the people in the recovered areas, (2) In order to take into account that the real estate in Shanghai has been commoditized, and freezing it will cause serious problems in the financial sector, (3) In order to make the land registration process agile and eliminate unnecessary concerns of the people, (4) In order to comply with the original intention of exempting land tax and land tax, we should ask your ministry to approve and consult with the municipal government to inform the Land Administration Bureau of this city to postpone the collection of deed tax. The following is omitted."

### The China Cultural Service Society Establishes a Information Supply Department

The China Cultural Service Society at 679 Fuzhou Road in this city has established a "Information Supply Department" to facilitate the collection of information for individuals and institutions. It regularly provides modern information from newspaper and magazine clippings. This initiative is still a pioneering effort in China, and the number of those entrusting the department has been quite enthusiastic.

### The Hangzhou Reporter Group Leaves Shanghai Today

The Hangzhou City reporter interview group has been in Shanghai for seven days, and has visited party, government, and military leaders, newspapers, and institutions such as the Japanese Resident Management Office. Commander Tang specially hosted a banquet at the Kang Le Restaurant yesterday to entertain them. It is learned that the group will complete its mission and return to Hangzhou today.

### Southern Theater Military-Police Conflict Case: Severely Punish the Soldiers Who Caused the Trouble

(Reported by this newspaper) The authorities attach great importance to the military-police conflict that occurred at the Southern Theater in Penglai Market in Nanshi at around 9:00 PM on the 19th. Bai Chongxi, the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Military Commission, and Zhang Zhen, the head of the Military Discipline Inspection Group, visited the scene in person. It is learned that the eighteen soldiers who caused the trouble and their team leader are now being detained together and will be severely punished according to law. As for the injured traffic police officer, Liu Shouming, the bullet has been successfully removed, and after injections and treatment, he is still conscious, but he is still not out of danger. Yesterday, Deputy Director Yu of the Municipal Police Department and Chief Lu of the Penglai Branch Office personally visited the hospital to offer their condolences and gave 10,000 legal tender. The Police Department will hold a memorial service on a regular basis for the two security team soldiers who died, Shao Ganpan and Xu Zhirong.

### The Brave Soldiers of the 14th Division of the New Sixth Army Will Be Divided into Three Batches to Go to the Northeast; Division Commander Long Hosts a Reception for News Reporters; This Newspaper's Reporter, Mai Tian

"The 14th Division of the New Sixth Army has been in Shanghai for three months. This time, we were ordered to transfer to the Northeast. We are grateful that members of the press have come to see us off. Every officer and soldier of the 14th Division is extremely grateful. In particular, we will fulfill the responsibilities entrusted to us by the central government and work harder to repay your kindness. During these three months, the soldiers may have neglected something, and the officers may not have managed things perfectly. I hope you will forgive and guide us so that the army and the people can become one. I am very grateful in my heart. We are the national army, and we must fulfill our responsibility to protect the people." Division Commander Long Tianwu's passionate remarks made us feel infinitely excited and moved.

Repeatedly Defeated Stubborn Enemies; Outstanding Achievements

Yesterday afternoon at 2:30, the reception room of the 14th Division headquarters at the old site of Zhongshan Hospital in Fenglinqiao, Xujiahui, was crowded with more than fifty reporters and officers. The atmosphere of warmth and integration was rarely seen in previous press conferences after the victory.

The 14th Division has a long history of more than ten years and has made great contributions in the War of Resistance Against Japan. In the Battle of Myitkyina, the officers and soldiers of the 14th Division made heroic sacrifices and were loyal to the country, reaching four to five thousand people. They have been to India, Burma, and various parts of Southwest and Central China. After being assisted by the British army and equipped with the latest equipment, the 14th Division was renamed the New 14th Division.

The first batch of the 22nd Division of the New Sixth Army began on the 16th and departed in two batches on the 19th for four days by U.S. landing craft. They have now reached their destination. If the port is not frozen, the planned landing site is Huludao, and the journey is four days, if the weather is calm.

Transported in Batches; Orderly

The 14th Division will be dispatched in three batches this time. The first batch of more than 5,000 people will be transported on six ships, each ship carrying about 700 to 900 people. They have already boarded the ships yesterday and will depart this morning. Yesterday, when boarding the ship, there were also U.S. naval officers and three U.S. senators visiting the Gonghexiang Wharf. Under the supervision of the U.S. military, their transportation was completely regulated and orderly. For example, weapons and ammunition were transported completely within the 24 hours from 8:00 AM on the 20th to 8:00 AM on the 21st, luggage and personal weapons were transported within the 24 hours of the second day, and soldiers and accompanying luggage were transported completely within the 24 hours of the third day. Before boarding the ship, the soldiers also underwent disinfection and preventive injections. What they eat on the ship is dry food, salted fish, pickles, etc. Each ship has two gas stoves, which can cook for 60 people at a time, so meals are served on the ship all day long. The second batch will transport the headquarters personnel and is scheduled to board the ship on the 25th. These three batches are all strategic troops. Other vehicles and donkeys and horses in the Changsha area are still being transported continuously.

Five Female Comrades Serve with the Army

There are 20 political workers in the 14th Division, five of whom are female comrades. They also wear military uniforms and will also depart this time. Most of their current work is performing plays and nursing. These five female comrades are all under the age of 25, have a secondary education, and were all recruited in Hunan. Their monthly salary is around 10,000 yuan. Yang Zongyi, a political officer, is a reporter for the Chongqing Xinshu Daily. They all joined voluntarily. Judging from the energetic spirit of Officer Yang and the others, we know that they are making great contributions in the army.

In the open space, seven or eight strong men specially put on leather coats, leather hats, and leather gloves, which are the winter clothes of the New Sixth Army after arriving in the Northeast. So, the photographers were busy again.

All Kinds of New Equipment

Next, we were invited to Jiaotong University to visit their latest weapons and equipment, including heavy and light machine guns, submachine guns, rocket launchers, mortars, flat-firing guns, rifle grenades, and new wireless radios. The soldiers were busy preparing to leave, so we didn't have the opportunity to see other equipment. Seeing those majestic soldiers, I believe that Division Commander Long's words "take on the responsibilities entrusted by the central government... fulfill the responsibility of protecting the people" will definitely be successful. I congratulate our new China, and I wish those brave men a smooth journey and serve the country.

### Jiangfu Maru Sinks After Hitting Mine Off Wusong Port While Transporting Japanese Nationals; U.S. Warship Rescues, Most Japanese Saved

[Reported by this newspaper] The Japanese ship Jiangfu Maru, carrying 4,279 Japanese prisoners of war and nationals to be repatriated to Japan, was originally scheduled to leave the port the day before yesterday, but was postponed to early yesterday morning due to lack of time. Unexpectedly, the ship struck a drifting sea mine 30 miles outside the port of Wusong and exploded immediately. The Japanese captain of the ship immediately sent an emergency distress signal, stating that the entire ship would be destroyed if it could not be rescued within two hours. The U.S. warship "White River" was the first to receive the telegram and sailed to the scene of the incident to provide rescue. Xie Haoling, the interim commander of the Shanghai port, told this newspaper's reporter that the Japanese prisoners of war and nationals on the ship were rescued by the U.S. warship. Except for a very small number who went missing, they were all safe. They are now being transported back to the Yangshupu Wharf by the U.S. warship. However, most of the rescued Japanese people had their clothes soaked. I have requested instructions from the authorities and will go to take care of them this morning. Also yesterday, in addition to the "Jiangfu Maru," three U.S. landing craft and the Japanese ship "Rongfeng Maru" transported a batch of more than 8,000 Japanese nationals and prisoners of war back to their country.

### US Military Tribunal to Try Japanese War Criminals; Officially Begins This Morning; General Middleton Appointed Chief Presiding Officer

The US War Crimes Tribunal was originally scheduled to conduct a preliminary hearing of Japanese war criminals at Tilanqiao Prison yesterday morning. However, due to the incomplete arrangement of the courtroom, the hearing has been rescheduled to officially begin at 10:00 AM this morning.

Heavily Guarded

All war criminals in the prison are under strict surveillance. The six-story prison has heavily guarded entrances and is surrounded by stone walls and iron gates. Each prisoner is confined to their cell. Aside from military police patrolling the corridors with iron locks, there is no sound. The Japanese individuals involved in the killing of American pilots are particularly distraught. Their faces are expressionless when encountering people, their fate is in the hands of the American military judges. In two or three weeks, we can expect the answer of "the killer dies".

Trial According to Law

The US Army Headquarters announced yesterday that the US War Crimes Tribunal is scheduled to formally conduct the preliminary hearing of Japanese war criminals at the Tilanqiao Prison courtroom at 10:00 AM this morning. The first case will involve the trial of seven principal Japanese war criminals who killed American airmen in Hankou, along with eleven related personnel, totaling eighteen individuals. The US military has appointed General Middleton, former commander of the US Training Group, head of the US Personnel Evacuation Service, and current commander of the US Military Supply Department, as the chief presiding officer. Other judges include Colonel Spink, Colonel Auster, Colonel Gaddo, and Lieutenant Colonel Misar. The prosecuting attorney is Lieutenant Colonel Weiss, assisted by Captain Garland. The defense attorney is Lieutenant Colonel Coggins, assisted by Captain Rivelle. All proceedings will be based on legal provisions and the truth of the events. The reason for the prosecution of these Japanese prisoners is: "On December 16, 1944, they killed American pilots with cruel and inhumane methods, violating international law. The real names of the killed American pilots have not yet been found, but there are clues being investigated. On the day of the trial, US Air Force Captain Ronison will testify, and many US soldiers will attend as observers."

### Italian Lawyer Denny Acquitted and Released

[United Press Report] The China Theater Command announced today that Italian lawyer Denny, accused of war crimes, was thoroughly interrogated by the US Army authorities and found innocent. He was released yesterday after taking an oath.

### Korean Military Government Representative to Assist in the Evacuation of Korean Nationals

[United Press Report] Colonel Wideman, director of the US Army Repatriation Group, stated that a formal representative of the US Military Government in Korea will be sent to China to assist in the repatriation of Korean nationals. Wideman recently consulted with US authorities in Tokyo and preparations have been made for the evacuation of 4,000 Koreans in the Shanghai area and 6,000 Koreans in the North China area. He stated: "We have requested that the military government limit the Korean evacuees to those who are truly impoverished and that those who wish to return for political or other personal reasons should not be allowed to board American ships. We have been notified that two Koreans and one American representative will be sent to China to be responsible for most of the planning work."

### Water and Electricity Supply in Zhabei Under Active Restoration

[Report from this newspaper] Before the war, the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company had a water plant and a power plant on Jungong Road in Zhabei, supplying water and electricity to Zhabei, Wusong, Dachang, Luodian and other districts. After the outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai Battle, the plant site and water and electricity facilities were all located in the war zone. In addition to the destruction of the two water and electricity plants, other facilities such as water pipes, electrical wires, and utility poles were even more severely damaged. Since the victory, the company has actively searched for various materials and diligently carried out repairs. However, there is still a shortage of general materials, which has affected the progress of the repair work. It is expected that the power generation work will have to be delayed for several months before there is any indication of progress. Currently, the company's water supply can barely meet the needs of users. The source of electricity is temporarily supplied by the Shanghai Electric Power Company, so the company has the difficult experience of not being able to satisfy the external requests for water and electricity restoration. Recently, although the company has obtained a loan of 200 million yuan from the Four Banks Joint Treasury, it still feels that it is insufficient. It is hoped that the government can provide manpower and material assistance. Currently, the company's water and electricity revenue can barely maintain costs, but the electricity revenue is often at a loss.

### China National Aviation Corporation Increases Flights to Chongqing

In view of the increasing number of passengers traveling from Shanghai to Chongqing, China National Aviation Corporation has temporarily added flights starting yesterday. It is reported that four planes flew from Shanghai to Chongqing yesterday.

### Selling Socks and Enamel Basins at Low Prices

It is reported that they will be sold on the 22nd and 23rd of this month. Each person can buy six pairs of cotton socks. The enamel basins will be sold on the 24th, and each person can buy six.

Public Sale of Soap

5,000 boxes of Xiangmao soap are being sold at low prices. The Enemy and Puppet Property Administration has entrusted the Shanghai Tobacco Exchange Association to distribute them. 1,000 tobacco exchange stores throughout the city are scheduled to start selling them this afternoon. Each pack is priced at 150 yuan, and each person is limited to one pack, while supplies last.

Rice Price Limit

The Grain Administration Commissioner's Office recently released 5,000 bags of Wuhu Xian rice, distributing them to the San Tai Rice Company in this city for distribution and sale at a low price to rice shops throughout the city. The price is limited to 7,500 yuan per bag, and rice shops can add a profit of 8%. The rice shops have already started making payments yesterday and can pick up the goods, which will be sold this week.

### Cloth will be Sold Again at Low Prices

Since the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Districts entrusted the Jianghai Customs to count the warehouses, the quantity of materials stored in each warehouse is quite considerable. For the cloth item alone, there are already about 10 million bolts. In addition to the 200,000 bolts that the Administration has gradually handled for low-priced sales and a portion transported to Chongqing and Taiwan for exchange of materials, the authorities have planned to handle the remaining portion for low-priced sales and complete the low-priced sales within three months.

The bureau will still allow a one-time supplementary tax application for stamp-duty-omitted documents during the promotion period to show consideration for the difficulties of merchants.

### China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Orders Ten Ocean Vessels from the US; Expected to Arrive in China by the End of Next Month

[Report from this newspaper] According to Xu Xueyu, general manager of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, in addition to receiving Victory-class vessels, the company has also purchased ten "N3" type ocean vessels from the United States. Each vessel has a tonnage of approximately 3,000 tons. These vessels were all built around 1944 and are expected to arrive in China by the end of next month. The Bureau plans to deploy these ocean vessels on the North and South Ocean lines and to Taiwan. However, these vessels are all cargo ships with a lack of passenger capacity. Therefore, it has been decided to build two additional passenger ships, each weighing approximately 2,000 tons, specifically for the Yangtze River. The Bureau has already started designing and prototyping, and will soon commission the Jiangnan Shipyard to build them. The Bureau has recently planned to purchase three more vessels from the United States (mostly Norwegian ships), each weighing approximately 2,000 tons, and five vessels from Denmark, each weighing approximately 6,000 tons.

Jiangshun Steamer Runs Aground Again

The Yangtze River water level is low and navigation is difficult. The Changxing steamer of the Sanbei Company previously ran aground in Dongliu and could not be towed for a while. Later, all the passengers and cargo were unloaded, and the ship was towed out. The merchants and passengers were then transported to Hankou by barge. The ship will return to Shanghai around this Friday. The Jiangshun steamer of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, traveling downstream from Hankou, also ran aground in Dongliu. The Bureau received the news and is trying to rescue it. The Yisheng steamer of the British-owned Jardine Matheson & Co., is making its first trip to Shanghai after the war. It is expected to arrive outside the Wusongkou last night and will enter the port at 2:00 PM today. It is scheduled to dock at the Taikoo Wharf on Zhongshan East 2nd Road. After the passengers disembark, it will move to Qichang Depot to unload cargo and is scheduled to sail to Hong Kong. The Yongsheng steamer has already departed from Hong Kong for Shanghai and is expected to arrive in port this Sunday. It is reported that the next voyage of the ship will be to Tanggu.

The fire starter, Xia Jinlong, was arrested by the police and taken to the police station for investigation.

Barge Fire

At around 6:00 PM last night, a large barge was docked at Pier No. 7 on the west side of Xinzha Bridge, loaded with several empty gasoline barrels. A cigarette butt ignited a barrel, causing a sudden fire. A crew member named Wang Baoxiang was burned on the head and face while trying to put out the fire. The Zhabei Fire Department rushed to the scene and extinguished the fire after a while. The loss was minimal. The injured person was sent to the hospital for treatment.

He had dinner at the Hongyun Restaurant on Jinling Road the previous day and took a Route 1 tram home. When the tram reached the vicinity of the Eight Immortals Bridge, a pickpocket suddenly snatched Zhao’s hat from outside the tram and fled. Zhao jumped out of the tram window to chase after him. However, after jumping out, he fell to the ground and injured his lungs. He was dying. The police arrived and sent him to Nanyang Hospital for treatment, but he died soon after.

### Lack of Special Stimulation in the Market, Initial Fatigue Followed by Stability; US Dollar Weakens, Hong Kong Dollar Slightly Strengthens

Yesterday's gold market did not break away from its old tune. Large investors were selling gold for stocks, and blindly following retail investors continued to cut their losses. However, because the market has the strength of next-day delivery, it maintained the style of the previous day. The market was most tired at noon, but the result was stable. Lacking special stimulation, the trend was very mediocre. The market opened flat, hovering around 890,000. Near noon, the multi-party began to panic. The chips were originally loose due to selling, and at noon they fell to 877,000. The initial market was still flat, but when the next-day delivery rose slightly at low prices, it rose to 890,000 in the small market. The result was a slight setback of 1,000 compared to the previous close. Gold jewelry was priced at 95,000, silver at 750, and silver dollars around 460. The unofficial discount was still tight, with a premium of about 9 to 12 cents.

The US dollar was supported by hedging, and there were many people exchanging gold for cash. However, a certain industrial company in Sichuan poured out a lot of spot goods, so it followed the gold price and slightly weakened. In the afternoon, the gold market was assisted by futures and slightly recovered. The US dollar was still standing firm at noon because it was settled in cash, so the result was a slight setback of 4 yuan compared to the previous close. The Hong Kong dollar gradually stabilized. The old bills recovered slightly by 2 yuan. The transaction was limited. The new bills once showed a strong willingness to sell, with the "1" series rising to around 75 yuan, and the "2" series at 73 yuan. However, there was a lack of buyers, and in the afternoon it recovered slightly. The result was a slight increase of 1 yuan compared to the previous close. The Australian pound was priced at 3,500 for buying and 300 for the Ruble, with an additional 10% for selling. However, there was no market for large-denomination Ruble bills.

### Large Investors Putting in Effort to Boost Prices, Chinese Stocks Continue to Strive

Chinese stocks opened strongly, continuing the momentum of the previous day's afternoon. Guang Gang successively released Yong Spinning, transferring to Wing On Company, causing the company to rise repeatedly from around 900 yuan to above 1150 yuan. For other popular stocks, large investors released some of their holdings at high prices, and at noon there was a floating multi-party scramble for position. Yong Spinning retreated from 1800 yuan (this price has reached the predetermined target of 500 shares for 10 taels of gold) to 1620 yuan, Mei Ya retreated from 1160 yuan to 990 yuan, Xin Guang Jing Fu retreated from 85 yuan to 78 yuan, and Zhong Spinning retreated from 780 yuan to 700 yuan. However, in the moment of market closing in the afternoon, large investors forcefully raised the price, and Yong Spinning recovered its old look. The three small popular stocks recovered less due to limited time and resources. The noon closing result was 80 yuan better for Yong Spinning, a small 10 yuan for Mei Ya, the three small popular stocks rose slightly, and the company rose by 300 yuan. The afternoon asking price still made progress under the hands of large investors.

Foreign stocks were still encouraged by Chinese stock speculators, and buyers were diligent. Small and medium-sized stocks continued to progress, but large stocks were less common and not excited. The noon closing result was slightly higher for small and medium-sized stocks, while large stocks saw a slight setback for Jardine Matheson and a slight increase for Ewo Spinning.

### Government Bonds Fall Again

Government bonds were very mediocre. Retail investors continued to sell, seeing a further decline. However, B-bonds had short-covering at low prices, and a recovery was easily seen after the low. As a result, B-bonds were still down 30 yuan, and miscellaneous brands fell by 100 yuan each for A and B due to a lack of speculation, 120 yuan for D-bonds, and only 70 yuan for E-bonds.

The cotton cloth market changed from sluggish to stable, and wholesale transactions were no longer easy. Low-end grey cloth and fine cloth were hot-filled, slightly hardened, but it was also a temporary expedient, with little turnover. The buyer group had plans to return home, so the market was also scarce, and the trend could be stable until the end of the year.

### Yarn Prices Continue to Fall; Flower Market Has a Slight Decoration

Yesterday's yarn market was still sluggish. Many peers were still willing to lower prices to sell. Customer sales did not improve, resulting in another decrease of 20,000 for each yarn count. Only the price of 20-count Jinqiao yarn remained unchanged at 570,000, because there was a Hankou customer who specifically requested this brand, and the factory was holding out for the original price, so the price did not fall. The opening price for Spinning and Construction Zhu became less common, and there were fewer buyers, because those in the industry had already bought old brand yarns from the Japanese factories of various companies, which were not only losing money every day, but also encountering difficulties when delivering goods, so they were hesitant to move forward.

The current cotton market is still flat. Manufacturers are still only decorating transactions. Chinese factories imported 42-count raw material American cotton midling grade flowers priced at 85,000 yuan, 32-count raw material Dachongji flowers priced at 80,000 yuan, both of which were factory prices. Flower shops imported 20-count raw material Tongzhou flowers priced at 66,000 yuan, and 10-count raw material Yuyao flowers priced at 50,000 yuan, both of which were wharf prices. There were no reports of goods arriving at the dock.

### Raw Material Allocation for Silk Factories; Rayon Prices Fall Sharply

Factory Sutra Stands Still as Silk Goods are Sluggish

The rumor that rayon raw materials will be allocated to silk factories has been confirmed. The spot market fell sharply yesterday. 120-count Sky Bridge opened at 1.18 million yuan, then fell to 1.11 million yuan. Transactions were few. It closed at 1.07 million yuan. The advance was sharp and the retreat was continuous. In the afternoon, people's hearts were slightly restored and traded at 1.12 million yuan, a decrease of 200,000 yuan from the previous day. The machine study opened at 790,000 yuan. It is far from the current product building. A buyer entered for 390,000, Yuan was raised to 400,000. The price of factory sutras still stands still and has a very profitable image. The price of the silk web products are soft throughout and transactions are very rare. Yesterday's market calculated the opening of Mei Ya quilt covers at 730,000 yuan per hundred, large diamond grids at 2,220 yuan per yard, and Minsheng brocade satin at 10,500 yuan per piece.

### British and American Traders Inquire; Tea Merchants Have No Goods to Offer; Green Tea Sales are Extremely Strong

(Report from this newspaper) According to tea industry sources, British and American trading companies in this city have repeatedly received overseas telegrams stating that there is a great demand for Ping-shui pearl tea and Qimen tea, and they all intend to pre-order. However, tea merchants in this city, considering that it is not easy to find a considerable amount of tea raw materials at present, are still unwilling to give a definite reply. Generally, it is necessary to wait until next spring to start.

Recently, customer groups have had a very strong demand for red and green tea varieties, and especially green tea. Places such as Tianjin and Yingkou almost accept all comers, resulting in prices rising day by day, with a great sense of endlessness. As for black tea, although there are fewer inquiries than green tea, the market is stable and lacks change, but the bottom is solid.

### Liquor Tax Increased by 60%

The government authorities have recently announced that all foreign liquor must be subject to a 60% unified liquor tax, from locally brewed Russian wine to imported Scotch whiskey, and no exemptions are allowed. The locally brewed liquor is paid by the brewing manufacturer, and the foreign imported liquor is paid by the foreign liquor retailer. The reason for this tax method is that it is very difficult to collect from users in the market, and it is easy to evade taxes. Therefore, from today, all kinds of foreign liquor will be increased by 60% to cope with this situation. This unified tax will also have a stamp affixed to the liquor bottle to show that the tax has been paid.

### Grain Administration Throws Out Wú Rice; Rice Market Rally Slightly Sets

[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday's rice price was very strong on this street because there were fewer arrivals and stomachs were full. Taking advantage of the continuous rise, the price rose again. At the opening, thick japonica rice reached 10,500 yuan. There were more buyers than sellers, and there was still a rising sign. The Grain Administration Office of this city threw out a large batch of banana rice due to the excessive rise, first opening at 8,500 yuan, but there was no transaction, and gradually dropped to 7,500 yuan, with a transaction of about 10,000 stones. This street has absorbed some, and the thick japonica and thin rice had to change from rising to fatigue. Japonica rice fell by 200-300 yuan, early thin rice fell by 400-500 yuan, indica rice fell by 500-600 yuan, and white yuan also fell by 200-300 yuan. The oil market was both strong and weakened, and continued to rise by hundreds of yuan. Soybeans were stagnant, and the price fell slightly by 100-200 yuan. The market had few transactions. Soybean cake was tired and did not open. Flour transactions turned tired, adding a small 100-200 yuan. The liquor market had quite active year-end sales, and the price rose again by 1,000 yuan.

### The Legal Principle of Returning Confiscated Yarn and Cloth

The enemy and puppet regime's confiscated yarn and cloth are essentially stolen goods. The portion that has already been illegally disposed of cannot be returned to the original owners immediately and awaits future claims for compensation. The remaining portion should naturally be returned to the original owners. It is absolutely unacceptable to confiscate all remaining stolen goods simply because the original items cannot be identified. Although the brands and names of the yarn and cloth may vary, they can be proportionally returned with goods of the same type, quantity, or quality.

Even if the enemy and puppet regime paid a small sum of money when confiscating the yarn and cloth, the amount is so minimal that it cannot compensate for the entire loss, being less than one or two percent of the original value. Logically, the meager sum received under duress cannot be considered full consideration, and the right to request the return of the goods should not be forfeited. Even if, legally speaking, the money received by the yarn and cloth merchants at the time is considered a form of enemy property, allowing the yarn and cloth merchants to return it in proportion after the remaining confiscated goods are returned, and then confiscating it by the state, would be something the yarn and cloth merchants would consider.

In conclusion, returning the yarn and cloth confiscated by the enemy and puppet regime is proper both morally and legally. As for the method of returning them, it requires careful handling by the authorities. (Wang Xiaowen)

The unsealing will proceed starting with institutions that are smaller in scope and simpler in work. The sequence will generally be as follows: (1) Puppet Astronomical and Meteorological Affairs Committee, (2) Puppet Central Library, (3) Puppet Museum Affairs Committee, (4) Puppet Library Affairs Committee.

### Teachers' Salaries in Jiangxi Province Increased by 700% Compared to Pre-War

Starting from January this year

(Dahua News Agency, Jixian) Lai Wenhua, the principal of Ganxian Middle School, stated that the school's expenses from August to December of the 34th year have not been received, causing serious economic problems. He went to the province to request allocation and learned that the provincial government had not been in office for two months due to the relocation of the government seat and had changed the new budget, causing most of the expenses not to be distributed. Recently, a total of 29 schools went to the province to apply for expenses. It is reported that the school's unreceived expenses and public grain have now been fully returned. It is also said that this year, the central work is to "prioritize education," mainly to enrich the equipment of various schools and rehabilitate all academic nuclei. Therefore, starting from January, the treatment of teachers will uniformly follow the central government's orders, with a basic amount of 20,000 yuan per person, and salaries will be increased by 700% compared to before the War of Resistance. However, some schools suffered severe damage during the War of Resistance, and the province cannot provide large subsidies for rehabilitation for the time being. It has specially formulated rehabilitation measures, ordering schools with a history in the province to establish a school rehabilitation committee and ask each alumnus to donate 1,000 yuan to be used for school rehabilitation expenses.

### Changes in Landscape Painting Style

— Shi Chongpeng

Landscape painting originated in the Jin Dynasty. Emperor Ming's "Swift Boat on the River," Wei Xie's "Banquet at Yaochi," Dai Da's "Wu Zhong Streams and Mountains Dwelling," and Gu Kaizhi's "Snow-Covered Five Old Peaks" are all among the earliest renowned works of landscape painting. However, most served as backgrounds for figure paintings, with only Gu Kaizhi progressing from using landscapes as backgrounds for figure paintings to creating independent landscape paintings, thus earning him the title of the ancestor of Chinese landscape painters. During the Southern and Northern Dynasties, landscape painting further progressed and became purely independent, with dedicated landscape painters such as Zong Bing, Wang Wei, and Emperor Yuan of Liang, all of whom wrote treatises on landscape painting. After the Tang Dynasty, landscape painting diverged into Northern and Southern schools, with styles evolving from rough and simple to elaborate and detailed, and from deep and vibrant colors to light and elegant hues. Li Sixun and his son's blue-green landscape paintings were the founders of the Northern School, while Wang Wei's ink landscape paintings were the leaders of the Southern School.

The most notable landscape painters of the Five Dynasties period were Jing Hao, Guan Tong, and , their style changed to being antique and profound. Other Northern School painters were also influenced by the Southern School's ink paintings, gradually becoming assimilated. Therefore, during the Liang, Tang, Jin, Han, Zhou, and the Five Dynasties period, there were very few purely Northern School painters. In the Northern Song Dynasty, paintings from the dynasties mentioned above became the origin for the paintings of Li Cheng and Fan Kuan, they were considered the three great masters of the Northern Song Dynasty. However, their styles varied: paintings from the original dynasties focused on ink and preferred to depict landscapes south of the Yangtze River, which Ju Ran imitated. Li Cheng used ink sparingly, preferring to depict distant, cold forests, with snow scenes being particularly outstanding. Xu Daoning and Guo Xi were both students of his. Fan Kuan preferred to paint tall ridges and dense forests, using deep and heavy strokes, creating elegant and secluded imagery. In addition, Mi Yuanzhang distantly imitated Wang Qia and closely followed the style of older paintings, covering the paper with jade-like textures, creating the unique Mi School cloud and mountain style, which was also a distinctive style of Northern Song landscape painting and belonged to the Southern School. After the Southern Song Dynasty, Zhao Boju, Li Tang, Liu Songnian, Li Song, and others flourished in the Painting Academy, their brushwork being delicate and moist, and their colors being primarily blue and green, known as the Academy style of painting, which was actually a branch of Li Sixun's blue-green style. At the same time, within the Academy style, Ma Yuan and Xia Gui, both of whom studied under Li Tang, used more ink, with rough and vigorous strokes, eschewing delicacy and moisture, creating a unique style of ruggedness, already influenced by Dong Yuan, Fan Kuan, and Mi Fu, abandoning the Northern and Southern schools for a unified approach. Landscape painting thus underwent another transformation.

In the early Yuan Dynasty, apart from a few such as Qian Xuan who continued the Southern Song Academy style, Zhao Mengfu was known for his delicate and moist style, but expressed with simplicity and directness. The styles of Gao Kegong, Cao Zhibai, and the Yuan Dynasty's Four Masters – Huang Gongwang, Wang Meng, Ni Zan, and Wu Zhen – although with minor differences, did not stray beyond the scope of the Southern School, advocating a simple,淡然 (tranquil), and refreshing style. Entering the Ming Dynasty, landscape painting diversified into many schools, the most prominent being the Zhe School, the Academy School, and the Wu School. Dai Jin emulated the styles of Ma Yuan and Xia Gui, forming the Zhe School, with Wu Wei and Shen Zhou being its leading figures. The Academy School, including Zhou Chen, Tang Yin, and Leng Qian, were all skilled in blue-green landscape, with brushwork more delicate and meticulous than the Zhe School, and with a gentle and elegant style. The Wu School, on the other hand, followed Wang Wei and subsequent masters such as Jing Hao, Guan Tong, Dong Yuan, Ju Ran, Li Cheng, Mi Fu, Zhao Mengfu, Gao Kegong, and the Yuan Dynasty's Four Masters. Many were from Wu, thus it was named the Wu School, and included dozens of artists such as Dong Qichang, Chen Jiru, Xie Shichen, and Li Rihua. Their style was elegant and refined, distinct from the Zhe School and the Academy School.

Since the Qing Dynasty, the style of landscape painting has not undergone any significant changes or progress. The overall style generally follows the Southern School, with numerous branches and factions. The Four Wangs and Wu Yun are the leading figures in this, with those who imitated Dong Yuan and Mi Fu, using wetter brushwork and more moist ink, attributed to Dong Qichang, known as the Huating School. Those who emphasized dry brushwork and dry ink, following Yunlin, were called Shi Hongshi, known as the Xin'an School. Those who used loose and elegant brushwork, with warm and thick colors, following Dong Yuan, were attributed to Zhao Wendu, known as the Songjiang School. In addition, those who followed Xiao Yuncong were the Gushu School; those who followed Luo Mu formed the Jiangren Society, establishing schools based on location, but their styles were all related to the Southern School, moving within the styles of Dong Yuan, Ju Ran, Mi Fu, Gao Kegong, and the Yuan Dynasty's Four Masters, without much difference. Those who did not belong to these schools, with peculiar brushwork and uninhibited style, becoming masters in their own right and establishing their own banners, included Shi Tao, Shi Xi, and Bada Shanren. Furthermore, there were also titles such as the Nine Friends of Painting, the Eight Masters of Jinling, the Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou, the Ten Philosophers of Painting, and the Six Recluses of Kunling, each with their own merits.

### Textual Criticism and Commentary on Ling Tingkan's "Poems on Opera Quips" (Continued)

— Zhao Jingshen

The Emperor married them off in the palace,

The top scholar was hung in the back garden.

"Tears on Blue Robes" and "Record of Gold Coins,"

All allowed Linchuan to tread the same ground.

The original note says: "The Yuanxiao 'Tears on Blue Robes' ordered marriage in the palace, the 'Record of Gold Coins' cruelly interrogating Han Hong, are all sources for Tang Linchuan." According to this, "Tears on Blue Robes" was written by Ma Zhida, and "Record of Gold Coins" was written by Qiao Ji. Tang Linchuan refers to Tang Xianzu, and specifically his "Peony Pavilion" imitating Yuan opera. What was imitated from "Record of Gold Coins" is the famous line in the 52nd scene, "Hard interrogation," which some people can still sing today; what was imitated from "Tears on Blue Robes" is the Song Dynasty passage: "Du, the Pacifier, reported Liu's affair to the Emperor. Liu also submitted a memorial to defend himself. The two men argued in front of the palace. Liniang personally went to court, entrusting Chen, the Palace Attendant, to report the events of her rebirth. The Emperor used the truth-revealing mirror to determine whether Liniang was a human or a ghost, and inquired about the events before and after her death. As a result, the rebirth was confirmed, and the father and son, husband and wife, recognized each other, and by imperial decree, they were married, the whole family reunited." The origins of the "Peony Pavilion" story are explained in detail by Zhang Youluan's "Tang Xianzu and his Peony Pavilion," but the scene in "Tears on Blue Robes" has not yet been pointed out.

With nimble hands, new colored silk is spun,

Each one strives to embroider exquisite patterns.

Who knows that the plain white brocade,

Yields to the "Grain Selling in Chenzhou" lyrics.

Many are excellent in literary style. However, in terms of plain description (i.e., the natural style), none can surpass the anonymous "Grain Selling in Chenzhou." I seem to remember that the author of this play also had a name. The Tianyi Pavilion's Ghost Register seems to say that the author's name was Lu Dengshan. Ling's praise of this play must be his personal opinion.

Zhongxuan suddenly becomes the son-in-law of the Lord,

Pei Du once served as a "White Prime Minister."

If one insists on consulting historical records,

Then the Yuan drama's rules will scatter like tumbleweeds.

The original note says: "Yuan Dynasty plays often conflict with historical facts, showing their intention to create drama. Later generations are unaware of this and try to explain them away, which is absurd." This explains the author's attitude towards the inconsistencies between Yuan Dynasty plays and orthodox history. He believes that this is precisely one of the characteristics of Yuan Dynasty plays, that it is a wild art and does not need to adhere strictly to orthodox history. The following several poems express the same opinion. The first line refers to Zheng Guangzu's "Drunk Thinking of Home: Wang Can Ascends the Tower," which ends with Wang Can marrying Cai Yong's daughter. The second line refers to Zheng Guangzu's "The Prunus Blossom Maid Deceives the Hanlin Scholar's Romance." The character says: "My surname is Bai, my given name is Minzhong, and I am Bai Letian's younger brother. My father once campaigned in Huaixi with Duke Pei Du of Jin. Duke Jin said: 'I have a daughter, named Xiaoman, whom I will marry to your son Minzhong.'"

Bi Shi bares his heart like Ji Fu,

Yuanzang worships Buddha like Wu Changling.

The Star-Picking Tower and Tang Sanzang,

Don't laugh that all these words are unfounded.

This poem has the same intent as the one above. Bao Jifu wrote "Bi Shi Bares His Heart at the Star-Picking Tower," which likely influenced Xu Zhonglin's "Investiture of the Gods," as Xu Zhonglin used it as part of the materials for "Investiture of the Gods." Wu Changling wrote "Journey to the West," which has editions in the World Literature Library, the Complete Collection of Yuan Dynasty Drama, and the Gukou Wenying reprint.

Bawang burns the camp like Liang's genius,

Across the river, they fight wits at the Tortoiseshell Banquet.

Even today, the alleyways talk about the Three Kingdoms,

All from the tunes of Yuan Dynasty drama.

"Zhuge Liang Burns Bawang's Camp" and "Two Strategists Fight Wits Across the River" were both written by anonymous authors, both appearing in "Selections of Yuan Dynasty Opera - Romance of the Three Kingdoms." Hu Shi's research in his "Collected Essays" is the most detailed. Later, Sun Kaidi also wrote a specialized research paper, which is the most refined. Yuan Dynasty opera and "Romance of the Three Kingdoms - Spoken Version" are the closest. The "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" by Luo Guanzhong, which is discussed in the alleys, is already a layer removed from Yuan Dynasty opera.

Is it real, is it drama, confused and misinformed,

A mayfly shaking a tree, unaware of its own limitations.

Believe it or not, Bao Zheng of the Eastern Capital,

Wisely beheads Lu Su with a golden decree.

The original note says: "Yuan Dynasty Guan Hanqing and Yue Fei, often have extremely unreasonable and laughable elements, showcasing their style in this way. Recent authors value a lack of flaws, so they compensate and cover things up more and more, and stray further and further from the source." This statement captures the essence of Yuan Dynasty opera. Yuan Dynasty opera: "The text exists, its brilliance shines ten thousand feet. A mayfly shaking a large tree is laughable, unaware of its own limitations." The words used to comment on Li Bai and Du Fu can be used here. "Bao Zheng Wisely Beheads Lu Su," the "Selections of Yuan Drama" attributes to Guan Hanqing, but the "Ghost Register" and the "Orthodox Music Register" do not record it. The Garden Book also says it was written by an anonymous author. Whether Guan wrote it is questionable, but given Guan's works like "Magistrate Qian Wisely Dotes on Xie Tianxiang," "Du Ruiniang Wisely Appreciates the Golden Thread Pond," and "Magistrate Qian Investigates the Scarlet Robe," which love to use the word "Wisely," it is possible that Guan wrote it.

Shi Junmei is the originator of the chuanqi drama,

Chen Dasheng continues the legacy of the sanqu.

Waiting until the mid-Ming Dynasty,

Our family's lyricists achieved initial success.

I have previously stated that the ancestor of the chuanqi drama should be Song Dynasty plays such as "Wang Huan" and "Wang Kui," rather than Shi Hui's "Worshiping the Moon Pavilion" from the Yuan Dynasty. Ling is likely more skilled in musical meter and rhythm, but lacks knowledge of the history of drama, so when discussing the history of drama, he often makes errors. The sanqu poems written by Chen Dasheng of Nanjing in the late Ming Dynasty were printed in two collections in Lu Qian's Yin Hong Xuan Series. However, the Nanguo Lyrics, Yongxi Musical Treasury, Wu Sao Anthology, and other books still contain quite a few sanqu poems not included in the two books, about thirty or forty suites. If these were collected, they would make a very large volume. Ren Na and Ling Jingqian had both done this work, but unfortunately, it was never published. Chucheng refers to Ling Chucheng. His "Bearded Guest" appears in the "Second Collection of Sheng Ming Zaju." His "Northern Red拂 (Fu)" has also recently been reprinted. This is a retelling of the Tale of the Bearded Guest with a different protagonist. He uses three people to sing in "The Three Heroes of Fengchen," writing each of them as the main character, and the third book has yet to be found. He dedicated himself to popular literature. The "First and Second Slaps to Amazement" were edited by him. The "Pipa Ji" of the so-called Yuan Dynasty edition (reprinted by Chan Yin Lu) was likely his adaptation under the guise of antiquity. From this book, it can be seen that he made great efforts to research the ancient Pipa Ji in the opera scores. In the postscript to Pipa Ji, we know that he had also written a chuanqi based on the Yuan Dynasty's "舍汁衫 (shed blood shirt)".

Yan Zhou's jade flute conveys the sound of a phoenix,

Shaobai's black silk describes Washing Silk.

Seeking truth in events and beauty in writing,

Mistakenly taking cut paper flowers as spring blossoms.

Ling has repeatedly stated that drama does not necessarily have to conform to history, and now he reiterates this point. In this poem, he advocates for naturalness and opposes piling up and embellishment, which I strongly agree with. He says: Wang Shizhen (Yan) wrote the Chuanqi drama "The Story of the Ming Phoenix," seeking truth in everything; Liang Chenyu (Shaobai) wrote the Chuanqi drama "Washing Silk," seeking beauty in every sentence. Both of these attitudes are wrong. As a result, seeking truth does not necessarily lead to truth, and seeking beauty does not necessarily lead to beauty. On the contrary, the fake seems real, and the vulgar seems beautiful. The pursuit of truth and beauty results in lifeless paper cut flowers, not as good as the flowers of nature in spring, which cover the mountains and fields. They are unadorned, yet they have natural charm.

After Sisyphus, ancient tones went astray,

One after another, the soul returned and the hairpin was recovered.

Since Qingteng established a separate school,

Who else in the Music Bureau can continue the legacy of Cheng Xiao?

Xu Wei, the master of the Qingteng Study, his "Sisyphus" (四聲猿), according to Ling, has a divergent tonal system. Tang Xianzu's "Peony Pavilion" and "Purple Hairpin", causing the voices of all the people under the sky to twist, is indeed a fact. But Zhu Youdun's earlier "Cheng Xiao's Music Bureau" could not follow the Yuan Dynasty's musical rhythm, breaking the rules of one character singing in one act and four acts per book.

In front of the Jade Tea Hall, dusk after dawn,

Gourd-imitation is feared from depicting past people.

The foolish child does not recognize the邯鄲步,

Bitterly learning Wang Wei's banana in the snow.

Tang Xianzu, the master of Jade Teahouse, said: "My meaning is to let others copy the melody even if I break the melody." This means that I would rather the melody conform to my meaning than my meaning conform to the melody. It can be seen that Tang Xianzu was unwilling to draw gourds as they were, but to create his own situation. The general public does not understand and instead learns the 邯鄲步, then it is really like Tang said in his sarcastic poem: "Even if you cut and divide modern times, you will still be ashamed of Wang Wei's old snow scene."

Teeth, sounds, and vocal chords all vie for beauty,

From the brilliance of flowers, the Lesser Vehicle meditation unfolds.

In the cauldron, there is a divine elixir,

But merely refraining from swallowing the knife is not yet immortality.

This poem contains quite a bit of disparagement towards Wu Bing, the author of "Five Kinds of Glory." It says that he still cannot concoct the divine elixir, but can only swallow and breathe fire; he can only participate in shallow Lesser Vehicle meditation, not enough to discuss profound Great Vehicle meditation. The meaning seems to say that Wu Bing's heavy use of red and green is too excessive, only focusing on weaving dense patterns, resulting in a "tothful" wife (句齿) of the lecherous Dengtuzi, and Dongshi imitating, failing. Wu Bing specifically studies Tang Xianzu, and this song is probably secretly scolding Wu Bing, right?

### Feeling Upon Returning to Shanghai

— Xu Junwu

The whirlwind chariot sends me off from the ten mile marker outside of Jiang, as if recovering a pearl carrying dust with me. The mood of the past follows dreams; a freezing, towering, maritime air surrounds the lights in the cold. To call out for the magpie, is there no regret? To seek skin from a tiger, I only feel apprehensive. Lingering on the tower, I smile bitterly at my loneliness, who will lend a branch for Du Ling's rest!

Writing Spring Bottom Autumn

### A Shortened Expression

— Wu Renzhi

Many people scold "officialese," but I have a different interpretation of it.

Literally, "officialese" should refer to the format of official documents. Although some people have a headache with phrases like "due to the aforementioned" and "upon receipt of this," a closer examination of its structure reveals that it is thoroughly and logically organized. If it encounters a case with verifiable records, if the person handling the case carefully examines the records, then the division of responsibilities can be immediately seen. Precisely for this reason, Qing Dynasty officials employed "secretaries." The brilliance of the "secretary" lies entirely in the skill of being able to reduce or shed his master's responsibility. Therefore, "officialese" should be a source of headaches for officials.

Here is an example: "Repeated orders and five declarations" are precisely a political weakness. If officials feel a headache about the exposure of weaknesses, then it is best not to leave traces of "repeated orders and five declarations." However, for example, when the Chairman's edicts are issued one after another, the official documents of the executing agencies transferring orders to subordinates must say "Repeatedly received the Chairman's 手諭 (handwritten edict)." Each  here represents a handwritten edict of one day. Three  mean three orders, and five  mean five declarations. This is because of the "officialese" that the traces of "repeated orders and five declarations" had to be left behind, which should be a headache for the officials.

However, "officialese" is what the common people have a headache about. Why is this? There is a common saying: "Officialese is just talk." It turns out that the "officialese" that the common people have a headache about is a shortened expression, referring to the four words that have been shortened at the end— "just talk."

### Winter Clothing and Such

— Wang Tiran

As the weather turns cold, the northwest winds rise, and the "filthy sentences" that "red doors smell of wine and meat" and "frozen corpses line the streets" cannot help but float to the minds of scholars. And when the weather turns cold, every night some poor people and bums freeze to death on the streets, which is indeed a very old and陈腐 matter. Regarding these types of things, most people generally disdain to give them a glance. Even if they occasionally see them on the road, they always urgently cover their noses and go on. This cannot be blamed on people's heartlessness, perhaps because death is ultimately ugly and cannot arouse the attention or interest of the living, right?

However, even if this is the case, death is ultimately the end of life. If one can live, how can one die? Since death occurs, there must be a reason why life is difficult. Thinking like this, one can know that life is originally ugly as well. Perhaps even uglier than death. In order to survive, in order to live, how many people are servile, shameless, willing to sell their souls, willing to stain their bodies, to maintain their ugly lives. They have survived, but is their life not even uglier than death? Comparing it in this way, those who are turned over in ditches and finally die on the cold roads, although they are pitiful "weaklings," are worth pitying.

Especially when we think that after victory, many people have achieved "five sons succeeding in the imperial examinations" (a sign of great success), but many people have "nothing left in life," even being stuck and dying, we ultimately feel that it is too unbearable. Who has failed them? Why is no one saving them? Indeed, there are too many people waiting to be saved now, and philanthropists cannot save everyone. But the fact is that relief work this year has not been done well from beginning to end.

Perhaps the reason is that we see news about the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) in the newspaper every day, so everyone feels that there are already enough people to save the poor. In fact, the gentlemen in the "Kind Salvation" bureau are also feeling very troubled with the task of relief. There are many examples, such as flour. Although the Western flour is white and good, the common people are buying very little of it. Clothes are also a big problem. The UNRRA has tens of thousands of sets of Western suits, originally prepared to be distributed to poor people, but it is said that they are not suitable for Chinese poor people to wear, because Chinese poor people should only wear cotton-padded jackets. And as a certain newspaper reporter said with flourish, giving these Western suits to refugees makes them "Western-dressed bums," which is even more humorous but also makes people feel a mix of laughter and tears. Such things show that saving the poor is really difficult. And both being a philanthropist and a charitable official are difficult, that is self-evident.

Thinking about it this way, the most troublesome thing in the world is known to be all in China, and winter clothing is just one example. We, being one of the Chinese people, have no other way except to feel ashamed and to pity ourselves.

### A Double Flight of Love (8) (4)

— Zhao Qingge

"Heavens! Last night I dreamed of a yellow oriole-like bird, flying out of my arms calling, and now this sound is the sound of that bird calling!"

Master Mo felt a sense of dread! He thought: Could it be that I'm dreaming again? He looked up at the window, the red sun was in the sky. His heart was filled with doubts, and in a state of panic, Mo Sheng rushed in again.

"Congratulations, Master! The Madam has given birth to a baby girl!" Mo Sheng said, smiling and standing to the side.

"Ah?" Master Mo seemed not to have heard clearly.

"Papa! Mom really gave me a little sister:" Bao Ling jumped up with joy. She grabbed Mo Sheng and clamored, "Mo Sheng, take me to see my little sister, I told Papa earlier: I want a little sister."

Mo Sheng did not say anything, and quietly pouted at Master Mo. Bao Ling understood what he meant and stopped talking.

Master Mo fell into deep thought again. Now that he knew the sound just now was the cry of a newborn baby, he quickly realized that last night's dream was a harbinger of this event. And so, he felt even stranger! He wanted to tell Bao Ling about this strange dream, but Bao Ling was too young to understand. Tell Mo Sheng, Mo Sheng is just a servant after all, he was afraid of hurting his dignity by telling him these idle words. In the end, he thought of Master Weng, and as if he had found salvation, he immediately instructed Mo Sheng:

"Mo Sheng, go and see if Master Weng is awake? Please invite him to come to our place when he's had his fill of opium, and tell him I have something to discuss with him. And while you're at it, ask him to bring a bottle of their family's good wine."

"Master, you can't drink any more wine! Your cough..."

Before Mo Sheng could finish speaking, Master Mo waved his hand and said:

"You don't understand! You don't understand! Go quickly!"

Mo Sheng had no choice but to agree and leave.

Seeing that Master Mo had returned to normal, Bao Ling seized the opportunity to beg him:

"Papa: I want to go see my little sister."

Master Mo nodded. But just as Bao Ling was about to leave, he remembered that Bao Ling's homework was not yet finished, so he stopped her, saying:

"You haven't recited your books yet!"

"Then, I'll recite them and then go."

Bao Ling quickly returned to her desk. Master Mo looked at Bao Ling and it didn't seem like she hadn't memorized the books. So he said:

"Alright! As long as you have memorized them well, just recite them tomorrow!"

Hearing these words, Bao Ling was overjoyed, so happy that her little heart blossomed, and she immediately ran outside. Before leaving, she turned back and asked Master Mo.

"Aren't you going to see my little sister, Papa!"

This reminded Master Mo. He thought to himself that's right, now that the child is born, he should go and comfort his wife, otherwise, he would be criticized and blamed by his wife for being "heartless and unrighteous" in the future. Thinking of this, he followed her out of the study.
