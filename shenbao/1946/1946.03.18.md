Increase National Treasury Revenue, Resolve Labor-Management Disputes

[United Press, Chongqing, 17th] The Second Plenary Session today adopted radical and decisive measures to resolve China's current economic crisis. President of the Executive Yuan Song Ziwen stated that these measures would encounter opposition from many parties, but the current situation was pressing, and tough steps had to be taken. The purpose of these measures is to curb inflation, increase national treasury revenue, resolve labor-management disputes, and adjust the salaries of civil servants, soldiers, and other government workers to match prices. The resolutions included the following points: (1) Based on the Three Principles of the People, to regulate capital and equalize land ownership, it was stipulated to add property tax, special excessive profit tax, and stock transaction tax. These new taxes would all adopt a progressive system, and property tax would be levied immediately. (2) To organize a labor-management dispute arbitration committee. Its decisions would be implemented by the government. If arbitration failed, the government could take over the enterprise. Employees of state-owned enterprises would be regarded as civil servants and would not be allowed to strike. (3) Salaries would be adjusted every three months based on the price index. The percentage increase would be inversely proportional to the base salary. Military pay would be increased appropriately, but not to the same level as civil servants until the military reorganization plan was completed. (4) To require the Communist Party to stop issuing banknotes and promote the unification of China's currency system.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th] The Second Plenary Session held its nineteenth plenary session this morning and amended and passed the resolution on the Local Administration Report.

### President's Closing Address: Resolving to Adhere to the Original Intention and Implement the Policy of Peace; Hoping the Communist Party Will Faithfully Fulfill the Agreed-Upon Plan

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th] At the closing of the Second Plenary Session, President Chiang delivered a closing address, stating: "Today, the plenary session concludes. We have had practical discussions on various domestic and foreign affairs issues. The direction of our party's future efforts has also been detailed in the declaration. How should we, leading the country with the support of the majority of the party, strive to strengthen ourselves, implement the Three Principles of the People, and seek lasting happiness for the country and the people? I have repeatedly explained this to you all, so I need not reiterate. What I want to emphasize today is that the current era is completely different from the era five or ten years ago. The result of this war has made people around the world realize the preciousness of peace. Only by leveraging the power of justice, peace, mutual trust, and mutual assistance can we prevent the resurgence of aggressors. The safety, security, governance, and chaos of any country are closely related to the misfortunes and blessings of the world. World peace depends on the peace of all countries, and the security of any country must be sought in the context of world peace. Our China has resisted the longest and suffered the deepest from the war. Therefore, after the end of the War of Resistance, we decided that China must take the road of peaceful unification. Any domestic issues must be resolved through mutual understanding and concession to achieve the goal of peaceful unification. In recent years, all government measures have been carried out in accordance with this policy. The holding of the Political Consultative Conference, the promulgation of the order to stop the conflict and restore transportation, the establishment of the Military Mediation Executive Department, and the agreement on the reorganization and unified compilation plan by the military three-person group are all sufficient proof of our painstaking efforts to seek national peace and unification at any sacrifice and any concession. We will continue to adhere to our original intention and strive for its thorough implementation. In the meantime, I want to especially mention General Marshall's contribution. General Marshall has worked tirelessly during his three months in China, sincerely and sincerely assisting our China's peaceful unification as an ally, so that our country can embark on the road of peaceful nation-building, so as to contribute to the peace of the Pacific and even the world. Their proposition is in line with our country's policy. He is completely seeking a solution with us from an objective standpoint and prudent consideration. He has overcome many difficulties with fair and practical proposals. We are very impressed and very trusting of his hard work and sincerity. Our allies are so enthusiastic about China's peaceful unification, not to mention our own Chinese compatriots, who should abandon any prejudices, take care of the entire future of China, and implement our goal of peaceful unification. I hope that the Chinese Communist Party can sincerely accept the kindness of our friendly allies, just like our government, and faithfully fulfill the agreed-upon plan, without any extra-curricular actions or any unexpected complications. Then I believe that General Marshall's mission can be successful as scheduled. We must know that this is not only General Marshall's success, but also the success of President Truman's policy of the United States, and the success of our government's policy of peaceful unification. We believe that the success or failure of this policy is related to the whole situation. Everyone should pay special attention to this point. Therefore, we must all trust each other sincerely and tolerate each other for the sake of the country, so that any current problems can be truly solved and a clear path for peaceful construction can be paved for the country as soon as possible."

### Full Text of the Declaration

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th] Declaration of the Second Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, full text as follows: The victory of the War of Resistance has been achieved since the Sixth National Congress of our party, which has allowed us to step into a new stage of peaceful nation-building. This conference is held during this important period. First of all, it must be pointed out that peaceful nation-building is the goal of our party and the nation. After the First World War, it was time to implement the President's nation-building strategy. However, it was missed in the hands of the remnants of the imperial system and separatist warlords. Now, after the Second World War, we have gone through eight years of bloody battles, eliminated the obstacles of Japanese aggression, and obtained a once-in-a-thousand-year opportunity to build the nation. We must not miss it again. In order to maintain the fruits of victory, we must grasp this historical key. In order to obtain the united cooperation of the whole country, this conference lists the following points to inform our compatriots across the country:

First, we must stabilize society, restore order, and complete the demobilization plan, as well as the work of peaceful nation-building. To build a nation, there must be stability, and stability must have peace. These are interrelated. Facing the devastation after eight years of the War of Resistance, experiencing the various obstacles and difficulties encountered in the demobilization work in the past six months, and witnessing the painful compatriots in need of relief, the displaced in need of returning home, the unemployed in need of restoring their jobs, and the oppressed in need of liberation, we confirm that there should be no more disturbances and disputes in our country, and there should be no more disorder in various places. Only by meeting the needs of our country and people can we live up to the purpose of our party's hard work and struggle. The government has made many concessions in the past six months in order to promote the progress of demobilization work. This conference believes that it is the correct measure. The reason why the government seeks perfection is to convene domestic parties and social figures to jointly negotiate before the National Assembly is convened, which is also to obtain a stable and peaceful environment to facilitate the promotion of nation-building work. This may change the nation-building order set by our party, but our party's spirit for the country and the people should be known to all compatriots across the country. We must implement this spirit and spare no sacrifice in order to achieve the rapid completion of the demobilization plan.

Second, we must convene the National Assembly as scheduled, return the government to the people, and achieve our long-cherished wish to implement constitutional power. The purpose of our party's leadership of the National Revolution is to establish the Republic of China and realize the Three Principles of the People. Democratic politics is indeed the main goal of our party's revolutionary struggle. As early as fifty years ago, the Xingzhonghui had clearly declared that our party's revolutionary history is to create democracy for China. If there had been no brutal Japanese aggression and national

### Councilors' Conference Opens the Day After Tomorrow; This Session Decided to be Fourteen Days

[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 17th] The Councilors' Conference has decided to open at the Military Committee Auditorium on the 20th. Registration began yesterday. Eighty-seven people registered in one day. Councilors Huang Yanpei, Tao Baichuan, Duanmu Kai, and Liu Baimin, who remained in Shanghai, and Councilors Li Youchun, Wu Yifang, and Shao Congen, who remained in Chengdu, and dozens of others, are scheduled to come to Chongqing by special plane on the 25th to attend. This session will last for fourteen days, from the 20th to the 2nd of next month, and may be extended if necessary. A tea party will be held at 3 p.m. on the 18th to exchange views.

[United Press, Chongqing, 17th] The Councilors' Conference is scheduled to open on the 20th to discuss domestic and foreign affairs issues and provide advice to the government.

[United Press, Nanjing, 17th] According to councilors, this session of the Councilors' Conference will focus on prices, government reorganization, and the situation in the Northeast. military obstacles, the constitution would have been implemented as planned long ago. Our party's resolutions and our party president's declarations over the years have all expressed our determination to implement the constitution as soon as possible. The government has never neglected the preparation for the implementation of the constitution even during the period of military tension. We urgently hope to return the government to the people, and convening the National Assembly is the secret path to returning the government to the people. The government has clearly announced that the National Assembly will be convened on May 5th. We must hold it as scheduled.

Third, we must explain our sincerity in implementing the resolutions of the Constitutional Government Consultative Conference and our determination to adhere to the five-power constitution. We have conducted detailed and solemn reviews of the various agreements of the Political Consultative Conference. In view of the necessity of domestic peace, stability, and unity, as well as the need to relieve the suffering of compatriots and stabilize the foundation of the country, we are willing to sincerely cooperate with all parties and social figures on all agreements of the Political Consultative Conference to promote its implementation. However, what we must insist on is that the revision of the draft constitution must conform to the legacy of the five-power constitution. This is because the Three Principles of the People and the five-power constitution are inseparable. Abandoning the five-power constitution will prevent the complete realization of the Three Principles of the People. The President's great and profound invention in the political system is to draw lessons from the constitutions of Europe and the United States and consider our national conditions to establish a long-term stability for the country. In the future, the soundness and consolidation of our national political organization require a perfect and feasible constitution. If the content of the constitution violates the five-power constitution, it will be difficult to implement in practice, and it will inevitably put the country in a disadvantageous position. Therefore, we must abide by and maintain the five-power constitution from beginning to end. This is really for the long-term interests of the country. I hope that all parties and social figures understand our position and understand our views. [To be continued]

### Railway Management Rights Dispute Still Unresolved

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th Urgent Telegram] Chongqing News, Chairman Chiang is deeply concerned about the progress of the railway restoration project. He has summoned Song Ziwen, Zhang Zhizhong, and Yu Feipeng twice last week to inquire in detail, and personally ordered Song Yu to restore traffic on the Jinpu and Jiaoji Railways within one month. It is heard that Zhang Zhizhong has discussed the dispute between the KMT and the Communist Party over the railway management rights with Zhou Enlai, but there is still no result. It is now believed that this matter can be resolved after Marshall returns to China. However, judging from the fact that the Communist army controls traffic on various lines, the CCP apparently wants to emulate its friendly country and use fragmented railways as collateral and delay this issue until after the government is reorganized before dealing with it.

### President of the Executive Yuan Will Not Be Changed for the Time Being

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] Chongqing News: It is confirmed that the President of the Executive Yuan will not be changed for the time being before the government is reorganized. Sun Ke seems to be interested in this position. Zhang Qun has publicly stated that he still intends to engage in local work in the future, implying that he has a great desire to build a new Sichuan.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] The Ministry of Finance will further streamline its subordinate units. The General Administration of Customs, which is equivalent to a parallel agency, is planned to be merged into the Customs Administration. It is also rumored that the Customs Administration will also be streamlined in the future.

### Telephone Lines South of Changchun Cut Off; National Army in Shenyang Advancing; Sipingjie Under Siege in Critical Situation

[This Newspaper, Shenyang, 17th] The National Army in Shenyang has been consolidating its defenses in the suburbs for days and making effective advances in the east, south, and north. Sujiatun on the south bank of the Hun River in the southern suburbs is an example. The city is peaceful, and water and electricity are sometimes available and sometimes not. People are scrambling to dump Jiang military tickets, so prices have risen by 100% in three days and are still rising. The plague is slightly slowing down.

[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 17th] The military uniforms issued by the Soviet army in the Northeast are red, light blue, pure black, without Russian or English, and the pattern is simple. Currently, the currencies circulating in the Northeast include the fake Manchukuo currency, the Soviet military currency, and the CCP currency issued by the Communist Party.

[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 17th] It is reported that a certain party is training 500,000 Japanese prisoners of war on an island near Dalian, with an unclear intention. There are 200,000 foreign soldiers, which are said to be the Soviet Union's preparations for major international events.

(Central News Agency, Changchun, 17th) The chairmen of the two provinces of Heilongjiang and Heilongjiang and all the receiving personnel arrived in Changchun by car from Harbin at 4 p.m. today. Since 4 p.m. today, long-distance telephone lines south of Changchun have been completely cut off, and the situation in Sipingjie under siege is critical.

[This Newspaper, Peiping, 17th] A certain political figure told reporters that the situation in the Northeast is still very chaotic. The CCP army may enter Harbin and even Changchun with the Li Zhaolin case. However, there is currently no diplomatic contact between China and the Soviet Union. Fu Bingchang is still stranded in Chongqing and has not returned. Jiang Jingguo has returned to Zhejiang to sweep tombs. How to resolve the Northeast issue is still hovering in the minds of Chiang Kai-shek, Xiong Shihui, and Du Yuming. It is generally judged that after Marshall consults with Truman, major diplomatic actions between China and the United States can be decided and started. Xiong Shihui is currently in Jinzhou dealing with the complex situation that is changing rapidly. Although there are criticisms of the Northeast receiving officials in Chongqing, there is currently no possibility of reorganizing the Northeast military and political organization and personnel. The claim that they will return to Chongqing to report is also inaccurate. Although there is news from Chongqing that the military three-person group has reached an agreement on the Northeast issue, the mediation department here has not received any specific instructions. But generally speaking, if the military three-person group can reach an agreement on the broad issues of the Northeast, the seriousness of the Northeast issue can be reduced.

[This Newspaper, Peiping, 17th] Li Zhaolin's death has thrown a new bomb into the current situation in the Northeast. This new bomb will be the roar of a hurricane that will soon hit the Northeast. What kind of background Li was assassinated by is widely speculated here. Some say that it is likely that a certain party wanted to use this to dilute and offset the Zhang Xinfu case. Others say that Li was quite close to the central officials in Harbin, which led to suspicion by radical elements of the Communist Party, and he was assassinated. The Liberation Sanrikan, a publication issued by the CCP here, firmly claims that it is a conspiracy by Chinese reactionaries against the Soviet Union and communism. Although the rumors are inconsistent, what is only known here about this matter is that Li Zhaolin was a very sensible Communist Party member. [Central News Agency, Washington, 16th, United Press] Senior State Department officials are gradually discussing the situation in Northeast China. Some people hope that the Soviet Union may take action soon to ease the tension, especially since Soviet Ambassador Gromyko has returned to Washington.

### The Situation in Northeast China is Extremely Grave; China's Efforts Will Surely Succeed; Marshall Hosts Journalists to Discuss Impressions of China

[Central News Agency, Washington, 16th] Marshal Marshall held a large-scale press conference at the State Department today, giving a general report on his three months in China as President Truman's special envoy. He stated the work he had completed and listed several important issues he will focus on after returning to China. He immediately reported on his work in China and the current situation in China, allowing readers to quote directly. The journalists then asked several questions, all seeking details on Sino-Soviet, U.S.-Soviet relations, and the current situation in northern Hebei Province, China. Marshal Marshall responded to the journalists' questions directly, humbly, and diplomatically. The full text of Marshal Marshall's statement is as follows:

Completing a Democratic Nation

The Chinese people are currently engaged in an effort that, in my view, deserves the cooperation of the entire world. This effort is almost unprecedented. The leaders of the Chinese people are working daily on peacefully discussing and resolving conflicts from the past twenty years, and making daily progress. They have now successfully ended the past twenty years of hostility. They have reached an agreement and are now working on demobilization and organizing the military into a national army. They have agreed to complete the basic principles of their country's political and economic progress, which Western democracies have taken centuries to achieve. If we want to achieve peace, "if the world wants to achieve peace," then China's current efforts must succeed, and there is an urgent reason for this.

Dependent on Other Countries

The success of China's efforts largely depends on the actions of other countries. If China is ignored, or if it encounters attempts to hinder its unified development and current aspirations, their efforts will surely fail. I believe the United States is best positioned to assist China in this. I deeply believe that the American people have a sympathetic concern for China. Our continued maintenance of peace in the Pacific, and the success of China's current efforts to promote unity and economic stability, are extremely important to the American people. I do not believe that any country has reason to suspect our motives in China. We do not seek to obtain any special interests in economics or similar areas. We do not ask for any price for our friendship itself. A stable government in China is of great importance to us. The coming months are extremely important for the Chinese people, and I believe they are also extremely important for the future peace of the world. The establishment of stable governments in various Asian countries is extremely important to us.

Beiping Military Mediation Department

The situation during my short stay in China was extremely complex. First, I was troubled by the U.S. military in the Pacific region, and then I was affected by the serious situation in Northeast China. Despite these difficulties, I believe that great progress has been made. I would also like you to have a better understanding of the organization we call the Executive Headquarters in Beiping, which is our most important tool in China at present. They organize several small groups that go to various critical areas in China to implement specific orders from various agreements, thereby transmitting them to the location of the conflict, whether it is combat behavior, restoring transportation, relieving a city under siege, sending back Japanese people, or the upcoming troop reduction, reorganization, and unification of all Chinese armed forces, all of which are carried out by these groups.

Without the Mediation Executive Headquarters, we would accomplish nothing. The Mediation Executive Headquarters is extremely important for implementing military agreements, including transportation. On my last night in China, until ten minutes before my departure, we were still making agreements on dispatching executive teams to the Northeast. It must be known that there is a lack of radio communication in various places, and there is almost no road transportation in these long-distance isolated areas. It is very difficult to transmit orders. I even had to travel 3,500 miles to the main areas where there were still disputes. There are still no representatives of the Executive Headquarters in the East Nine Provinces. The situation there is changing very quickly, and troops are being transferred everywhere, so various small conflicts are naturally unavoidable. These troops, especially on the Communist side, hardly know that we have established an agreement. Therefore, we must quickly send executive teams to the Northeast. The service of these executive teams is indeed invaluable. They not only work in extremely difficult circumstances, but also face great dangers. I would like to reiterate that without the Mediation Executive Headquarters we established in Beiping, we would not be able to implement these agreements. I met with General MacArthur in Japan and discussed the participation of Chinese troops in the occupation. General MacArthur expressed great welcome, and I think President Chiang will soon issue a public announcement on this matter.

Answering Journalists' Questions

In the question and answer session, Marshall stated: (1) The situation in Northeast China is extremely serious, (2) He will return to China soon, but the exact date has not been determined, (3) The food shortage problem is serious, approaching famine levels, (4) China urgently needs transportation equipment and factory machinery, (5) Financial aid to China is very complicated, but very necessary. The United States should give financial aid to China as a priority. Marshall refused to comment on the so-called (Inner Mongolia) issue, saying that he was not familiar with the situation. He also refused to comment on the definition of the Chinese Communist Party and its ideals. He also announced that the Chinese army is awaiting the reduction of 350 divisions to 50 divisions, and called this a "huge demobilization."

[United Press, Washington, 16th] President Truman's special envoy to China, Marshall, hosted journalists here today, and expressed his impressions of China, saying that the situation in Northeast China is "hanging by a thread." 250 divisions of the National Army, including 39 divisions trained by the Americans, are successively heading to that area. These American-style troops previously fought in Burma.

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 16th] The New York Times stated today: The Soviet Union has "advised" Iran not to submit a complaint to the UN Security Council regarding the entry of Soviet troops into northern Iran. The US State Department has received an official report on this matter, stating that the Soviet Chargé d'Affaires in Iran has informed Iranian Prime Minister Sa'ed that the Soviet Union will regard Iran's complaint to the Security Council as an "unfriendly act."

[Reuters, London, 17th] The latest news from London: Soviet advance troops have arrived at Bukan, 110 miles south of Tabriz, about 52 miles from the Turkish border.

[United Press, Tehran, 17th] According to reliable sources yesterday: 3,000 Soviet troops are now concentrated in Karaj, 20 miles northwest of Tehran, but Iranian Propaganda Minister Firouz told reporters: "These Soviet troops pose no danger to Tehran. Soviet troops have been stationed in Iran for four and a half years and have never attacked us. There is absolutely no fear of attack at this time and in this place," he said.

### Indian Political Situation Remains Unresolved; Revolution May Erupt; Nehru Welcomes British Prime Minister's Remarks; Jinnah Says They Are Like Walking a Tightrope

[United Press, Washington, 17th] The Indian political situation is becoming increasingly tense. If a satisfactory solution cannot be obtained in the coming months, the revolutionary crisis will deepen. But if a stalemate forms, what position Gandhi, who has the greatest control over the Indian people, will take, there is currently no sign to be found.

[Reuters, New Delhi, 17th] Nehru told reporters yesterday that he welcomed Prime Minister Attlee's remarks, but also said that the basic principle must still be to accept India's independence, so that negotiations can yield results. Nehru said he will go to Singapore today to meet Mountbatten to obtain psychological and other relief for his countrymen.

(According to British Prime Minister Attlee, who declared in the House of Commons on the 15th that Britain will do its best to assist India so that it can spend its free and comfortable life during the transition period before independence. It is hoped that the results of the Indian elections will still allow it to be a part of Britain. India's affiliation with the British Empire can have great benefits, and at this time, no major country can survive alone) [United Press, New Delhi, 16th] Jinnah, chairman of the Indian Muslim League, declared that as far as India is concerned, our position remains unchanged, that is, India should implement separation, which is the only way to solve the Indian constitutional problem.

### Soviet Newspaper Unceasingly Attacks Churchill

[Reuters, London, 17th] Moscow Radio broadcast to the United States: Churchill and his friends continue to do their best to divide the normal lives of various countries. While the world is busy with reconstruction and millions of Americans are trying to adapt to peacetime conditions, the Soviet Union is trying to raise the living standards of the Russian people, and Churchill's remarks are not aimed at seeking understanding among nations, but at inciting racial prejudice and suspicion.

### Remnants of Japanese Black Dragon Society Still Trying to Revive

[Reuters, London, 17th] The Tokyo correspondent of World News reported that the war between US counterintelligence personnel and Japanese secret organizations has reached a tense stage, and experts from the military government are doing their best to eliminate these organizations. On February 11 of this year, Japan's Empire Day, MacArthur Headquarters received a secret phone call stating that the Japanese Black Dragon Society and army officials were planning to assassinate high-ranking Allied officers and American sentries in front of the Imperial Palace. No incidents occurred on the date due to strict precautions. The US authorities have investigated the names of these secret parties clearly, but have not arrested them because they have not been able to prove their connection to the Black Dragon Society. The work of investigating these incidents is being handled by former New York Police Chief Valentine.

### Editorial: How to Save the Industrial Crisis

Since the opening of the foreign exchange market, the following are the most concerned things for the general public: First, although the central government has not stipulated a fixed ratio for foreign exchange, it has a clear goal in mind. What exactly is this goal? Is it still going to be raised, and to what extent? If it is lowered, to what extent? The fact that the higher forward price caused a sensation in the foreign exchange market, the speculative market, and even the entire market some time ago shows the depth of general public concern. Second, the gold market was opened at the same time as foreign exchange. Since the eighth of this month, the Central Bank has continuously allocated and sold gold, and the total amount has reached 2,851 bars, thus absorbing more than 47 trillion legal tender. The market price of gold in this port has been fairly stabilized. If this port and other ports buy in large quantities and flow out in large quantities, I wonder if it will continue to allocate and sell? Is unlimited approval granted? In the past, it seems that there was only allocation and sale, and no purchase. If the price of gold falls, will we purchase according to the market? In other words: Does the Central Bank intend to stabilize the price of gold at a certain level? Also, is the legal tender exchanged for gold bars truly recovered? Or does it come in with the left hand and still go out with the right hand? What is the relationship with the adjustment or tightening of currency?

Third, closely following the opening of the foreign exchange market is the issue of foreign trade. Because the distance between domestic and foreign prices is too far; according to the current exchange rate, it seems that the export industry is still unable to obtain considerable and general encouragement, and the US dollar is also making a fuss about devaluation, I wonder if the future exchange rate will be further adjusted appropriately? As for imported goods, the situation is exactly the opposite. All orders are very lively. It is rumored that the import cost of American dyes is four-fifths cheaper than the market price in this port! If the US dollar is devalued, its cost will be further reduced. This, on the one hand, can of course obtain considerable remedies in terms of the supply of materials, and the high domestic prices are also expected to receive some dilution. The problem is that many production industries are unable to withstand the pressure and have encountered very difficult situations. Some factories have already closed down, and some are planning to sell. Can the phenomenon of large-scale closure of factories in the Great Rear Area be avoided here?

Regarding the above-mentioned issues, for the first two (1) and (2), we can only let the authorities answer with facts. For the third (3), the situation is becoming increasingly serious. If there is no remedy, it seems that after the victory, the turmoil in the economic circles of the rear area and the phenomenon of depression in the industrial circles are very likely to be discovered quickly. Then how to remedy it? We believe that this issue is too complicated and should be addressed from many aspects. For example:

(1) For imported goods that require a permit, the central government has originally set up a special agency to handle them. They can carefully consider the needs and make appropriate adjustments.

(2) Goods that are freely imported do not need to go through a permit when imported. However, the source of funds is still in the Central Bank. Tightening up the funds, all unnecessary sources can not be restricted.

(3) Among the enemy and puppet materials, the raw materials part is said to be very large, and some of it has already been allocated and sold. Regarding the allocation and sales situation, if the strategy of abandoning and waiting for the opportunity to sell is changed, that is, changing the simple income doctrine and taking the promotion of production as the guiding principle, and suppressing the selling price as much as possible, so that manufacturers can obtain cheap raw materials, then, in the competition of national goods factories, survival, it can increase a lot of help.

(4) Many materials that were originally plundered by the enemy and puppets should be returned as quickly and as much as possible, without going around in circles, making people hopeful but unreachable. Especially for merchants' goods that are very obvious in fact, such as gauze forcibly purchased, which the enemy and puppets have not yet disposed of, whether they have been moved or not, easy to identify or not easy to identify, should always be fully returned in accordance with the approved original plan, so that merchants who have been plundered can breathe a sigh of relief, rather than holding them back and deepening their pain. It must be known that these are merchants' materials, not enemy and puppet materials. If they have been disposed of, they may be requested for compensation, but if they have not been disposed of, how can they be confiscated and re-disposed of?

(5) Many light industries are now mostly taken over by the state, and the only reason is to help them restore production, not to compete with the people for profit. The government has long sworn an oath and declared this to the public. Then, are the factories that have not been taken over by the state, since they are in extreme difficulty, should they be substantially assisted separately in accordance with this principle? We believe that whether it is providing loans, supplying raw materials, reducing or exempting taxes, or helping them solve transportation and power difficulties, it is all the same: it must be fulfilled, not just verbal benefits.

Most importantly, it lies in the self-awareness and self-help of the manufacturers. During the War of Resistance, due to the interruption of sources and the urgent need, all kinds of crudely manufactured and low-grade goods could obtain wide sales and high profits, which was originally an abnormal phenomenon. Relying on hoarding and speculation to increase profits is especially a temporary and unsustainable means. Even the various external subsidies mentioned above are all temporary in nature and cannot be regarded as regular. Therefore, in terms of management, technology, and sales, everything related to business and production should be improved, striving for excellence, and striving to stand on an invincible position, in order to last long and become great, and achieve the goal of true industrialization.

The low labor cost was originally one of the favorable conditions for China's industry. However, due to the continuous rise in prices, wages are also constantly increasing. Some people estimate that according to the current exchange rate, many wages are already higher than those in the United States. Then, this favorable condition will also gradually disappear. If those loose, disorganized, redundant, and wasteful styles continue to exist and are not rectified, what the future holds is really worrying.

###  贝尔纳斯·贝文 呼吁和平

 America has no intention of uniting with this country to deal with that country; Britain is willing to extend its treaty of friendship with the Soviet Union.

 [United Press, New Delhi, 16th] Secretary of State Byrnes, in a speech given today at St. Patrick's Hall, said that America has no intention of uniting with the Soviet Union to deal with Britain, or with Britain to deal with the Soviet Union. America's hopes are placed in achieving security through the United Nations organization, which is the path to achieving lasting strength. I wholeheartedly support the implementation of universal military training, so that America can always maintain a well-trained reserve army. When necessary, America must use force to uphold the principles and objectives declared in the United Nations Charter. The world is currently embroiled in serious disputes, but if we all seek solutions in a spirit of concession and friendship, they can be resolved without difficulty. Eliminating the wartime mentality will take considerable time; we must be patient, persistent, stand our ground, and not be driven by emotion.

 [Reuters, Glamorgan, Port Talbot, 17th] Foreign Secretary Bevin, in a speech given yesterday when accepting the honorary freedom of this city, said he would do his best to establish a lasting peace that would continue for generations. He also said: Regardless of any disappointments, Britain is willing to conclude a fifty-year treaty of friendship with the Soviet Union. The British government's foreign policy was explained by me in the House of Commons on February 21, and this statement was made in response to Churchill's speech in America.

###  德国东部苏军 悄然撤退

 [Agence France-Presse, London, 17th] According to a report from the Berlin correspondent of "The Observer": German

 [Agence France-Presse, Miami City, Florida, USA, 17th] Leading figures from American political, scientific, educational, and labor union circles recently formed a committee and today submitted a plan to President Truman advocating that the United Nations organization be transformed into a world government and that the veto power of the major powers be abolished. It is reported that this plan will also be submitted to members of the United Nations General Assembly and the United States Congress. The plan was drafted by Supreme Court Justice Douglas, with the assistance of members of the World Government Committee and the Atomic Energy Control Committee. [United Press, Miami, Florida, 15th] U.S. Supreme Court Justice Douglas told reporters here today that due to a lack of education, three-quarters of the world's population has not been able to read the Atlantic Charter or any other charter, and even if translated into their native language, they would not be able to understand it. If world peace is to be maintained in the modern era, the United Nations Charter should be revised to unite all countries in the world into a world federation, taking the same actions and not acting independently. However, to ensure that a world federation can be realized, it is essential to develop education so that the people can learn the meaning and purpose of a global federation. Douglas outlined the content of a world government as follows: (1) The world federal government will be modeled after the American federal system. (2) A world court will be organized according to the organization of the U.S. Supreme Court. (3) All countries should cede a portion of their sovereignty to the world federal government, but individual freedom must never be sacrificed. (4) Organize an international police force to maintain world security.  The Soviet occupying forces in eastern Germany will soon be redeployed, replaced by well-armed and well-trained police squads. Seventy-five percent of the Soviet troops have already withdrawn, and the rest will be withdrawn in a few weeks. This withdrawal has gone almost unnoticed.

###  丹属岛苏军 将开始撤退

 [Reuters, Moscow, 17th] Free union and free divorce, the so-called principle of freedom of love, is a thing of the past in the Soviet Union, and the family has now regained importance. "Marriage is a lifelong union" is the view of Soviet newspapers today, and single men, old maids, and families with very few children must pay special taxes. The government spares no effort to encourage childbirth. Mothers can receive bonuses, and maternity hospitals and nurseries provide free preferential treatment. Mothers with ten or more children can receive the "Heroine Mother of the Soviet Union" medal, and families with five to ten children can also receive the Honorary Motherhood medal.

 Once extravagant and luxurious Now utterly impoverished

 [United Press, Neuhause, Bavaria, 16th] Emmy, the wife of Nazi second-in-command Göring, first met Göring when she was performing a Goethe play at the Weimar Theater. After their marriage, they lived a life of extreme luxury during the heyday of the Nazi regime, owning priceless jewelry, gorgeous clothing, and several enchanting residences that they could move between. Since the collapse of Hitler's Third Reich, she has become utterly impoverished. She was imprisoned in an American military concentration camp near Munich for five months, but after her release, she had no money, no direction, and nowhere to turn. Therefore, she and her eight-year-old daughter, Edda, live in a small, humble three-room residence.

###  萧翁谈时局

 [United Press, Hertfordshire, England, 16th] When a United Press reporter asked George Bernard Shaw today for his opinion on British Prime Minister Attlee's remarks in the House of Commons yesterday regarding the Indian question, Shaw replied that self-government should be earned through effort, not given by others. He expressed doubt about Attlee's statement. He said, "Whether the Indian unrest lasts five hundred years or only five months, they will eventually gain independence sooner or later." Shaw also said that if India gains independence, it will encounter a difficult period of self-government, but after a considerable period of time, it will gradually improve. Shaw agreed with President Truman's statement on the Iranian question, saying, "Truman's view is correct; the situation in Iran is not dangerous." He ridiculed the talk of a Third World War, saying, "People are already extremely tired and hungry. No one can drive them to fight. Only after the world's famine has been eliminated will a future world war be possible."

###  法国一医生 杀人不眨眼 犯案累累今日开审

 [Reuters, Paris, 17th] Forty-nine-year-old Dr. Petiot, a medical practitioner, murdered as many as 63 people between 1941 and 1944. The case is scheduled to be tried tomorrow in the Seine Court. In the basement of the defendant's Le Sueur Street residence, there was a death chamber. While the victims struggled and screamed in the chamber, he watched with pleasure through a periscope in his study. The corpses were then sent to the furnace for cremation. The victims were mostly Jews who wanted to go to South America, criminals carrying赃 who wanted to escape, or people who held evidence of the defendant's drug trafficking. Petiot claimed that his "Philetoxe Party" had also killed Germans and French traitors, and that there would be worthwhile statements to hear during the trial.

 [United Press, Washington, 6th] [The atomic bomb experiment will be held in May near Bikini Atoll in the Central Pacific. American people are quite afraid that this experiment will endanger other parts of the world. Major General Groves, the person in charge of the atomic bomb manufacturing project, today issued a statement by scientists (Dr. Teller of the University of Chicago and Dr. Bethe of Cornell University) to dispel fears and calm people's hearts. The statement is as follows: "Whether the atomic bomb explodes near the water surface, on the water surface, or under the water surface, it only causes local disturbances on the spot, just like a large amount of ordinary explosives. This explosion is not enough to cause radioactive transformation of seawater. Otherwise, this transformation will continue non-stop, causing an atomic explosion of the earth. We have carefully considered this. First, the elements contained in water are known to be abundant throughout the globe. If there is a high-speed chain reaction on the planet, the planet will explode and destroy itself, but this phenomenon does not exist on the planet. This shows that it is also the case in seawater. Second, the composition of delayed pure substances in the atomic bomb also accounts for a large proportion. Therefore, the temperature of seawater near the bomb is about one million degrees, which is far from the temperature inside the planet, which is about two million degrees or more. Therefore, the situation occurring in the water is similar to the location very far from the center of the planet. Scientists all know that the nuclear reaction at a temperature of one million degrees is not enough to compensate for the radiation loss to keep it going. The atomic bomb explosion in the Central Pacific will definitely not cause a chain reaction to evaporate the ocean or explode the earth. Therefore, we are convinced that the underwater explosion of the atomic bomb will not cause a self-sustaining chain reaction. This is indeed the case with the current form of the atomic bomb. If the atomic bomb contains sensitive substances, it is still necessary to think twice when releasing it, because the temperature in the water may be even higher."

 [United Press, Roswell, 17th] It was announced here today: The Army and Navy had practiced with practice bombs shaped like atomic bombs in the turbulent sea near San Diego on Friday. Three B29 Superfortress bombers departed from Albuquerque, and nine F13 photography planes departed from here, flying more than a thousand miles to a point 200 miles off the coast, using a Liberty ship as the target. This was the last rehearsal before the atomic bomb test.

###  当前江浙最严重问题 海塘险象环生 钱塘海塘已崩溃成灾

 The most serious problems facing Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces now are the dangerous situation of the seawalls, with the Qiantang seawall already collapsing and causing disasters in Qibao and other places. With the approaching spring flood tide, the remaining seawalls are also in imminent danger. The water could potentially reach Changxing, cutting off the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway. The safety of this seawall is not only related to the lives of the people in the Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou area of Zhejiang, but also affects the survival of the entire southeastern people, including the counties of Suzhou, Changzhou, Songjiang, and Taicang in Jiangsu. If repairs are not completed before the autumn flood, the consequences will be unimaginable. Water conservancy expert Mao Yisheng, the chief engineer of the Qiantang River Bridge, as well as UNRRA Secretary-General Monner, who came from the United States to inspect the disaster situation, and Southeast Envoy Niu Yongjian, have recently visited one after another, and they all expressed great concern about the dangerous seawalls. Although the central government has allocated 60 million yuan to repair the dangerous seawall in Haining, it is still far from what is actually needed. Sun Xiaolou, director of the UNRRA Zhejiang-Fujian Branch, rushed to Shanghai the day before yesterday

Executive Headquarters Zhejiang-Fujian Branch Director Comes to Shanghai to Request Funds for Emergency Repairs

According to Sun, the Zhejiang-Fujian branch includes the two provinces of Zhejiang and Fujian. Out of the 77 counties and cities in Zhejiang Province, only six counties were not disturbed by the enemy. Thirty-eight counties and cities, such as Changxing, Wukang, and Xiaoshan, were occupied by the enemy for a long time, and the loss of houses amounted to 702,900 rooms. Currently, 20 million people have no food or clothing and are wandering in other villages. In Fujian Province, seven counties and cities, such as Xiamen, were completely occupied, and thirteen counties, such as Lianjiang, were partially occupied. The branch is now actively seeking relief, he said.

The photo shows the situation of the Zhong Zi Hao stone seawall in Wubao, Haining, being destroyed by the tide in the autumn of the 34th year of the Republic of China.  He worked through the night to request an additional 200 million yuan in materials from the Executive Headquarters to repair the seawall. However, the entire project is estimated to require at least 600 million yuan. It is hoped that the central government, UNRRA, and local authorities will jointly assist in completing this barrier that protects the safety of the Southeast. According to Sun, if the seawall is thoroughly repaired to seek a permanent solution, it will require as much as 1.5 billion yuan.

 A New Page in the History of Passenger Transport on the Two Railways Gasoline Train's Maiden Voyage: As Fast as a Rabbit

 — Xingwu, reporter of this newspaper

 Shanghai to Hangzhou in Four Hours: Faster Than the Express Train

 Sleek and Smooth: One Hundred Miles per Hour Clean and Beautiful: The Tour Car Truly Lives Up to Its Name

 The new-style gasoline train that had been advertised made its maiden voyage on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line yesterday. Tong Shida, the chief of the North Station, arrived especially early to preside over the departure ceremony. Director Hou of the Transportation Department, Deputy Director Guan, Section Chief Ouyang Zhi, Section Chief Li Songbai, who had come specially from Hangzhou, and senior personnel from various departments of the two railways crowded the station chief's office. Station Chief Lin Xiaojin was busy making phone calls, urging the much-anticipated "West Lake" to appear. Once, twice, until 7:55, it finally arrived at the station.

 Three purple, streamlined "tour cars," accompanied by a strong gasoline odor, appeared before the people, immediately causing a commotion and keeping Chief Tong busy. Here, someone wanted to ask him for instructions; there, someone wanted him to explain. He also had to find time to accompany the reporters on a tour. He said: These are gasoline passenger cars received from China Railway. Now they have been renovated and repaired. There are four in total that have been completed. Three of them will be temporarily formed into a train, running once a day between Shanghai North and Wuxi every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, named "Taihu." Every Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday, it runs between Shanghai North and Hangzhou, stopping only once along the way at Jiaxing and Suzhou.

 The gasoline train can travel at a speed of one hundred miles per hour. Because there is no need to add water or coal, it is very easy to operate, so it can reach Hangzhou in four hours and five minutes, which is 55 minutes faster than the express train. Each car has an engine, and both ends are equipped with starters similar to those of automobiles. If you want to reverse, you don't have to turn around.

 Yesterday was the first day of operation. To be cautious, each car had two drivers. At 8:25, with a whistle, the train moved slowly. Because the reporter wanted to conduct an on-the-spot interview, he set off with the train. Because it was the first operation, not many people knew about it, and because it was raining, 32 of the 222 seats were empty. Twelve minutes after leaving the North Station, we arrived at the West Station. It was originally scheduled to stop for two minutes, but yesterday it stopped for four minutes because Director Hou, Section Chief Ouyang, and others wanted to get off.

 The white carriages, the brand-new and soft velvet sofas, everywhere showed luxury. The car attendant diligently delivered hot water and hot towels, which can make you forget that you are in a car. Opening the car window, the fragrance of rapeseed flowers, the clear air after a long rain, made people feel relaxed and happy. People who live in cities can never enjoy the beauty of this nature.

 Wang Axiao, the repair mechanic accompanying the train, explained the structure of the gasoline train in detail. The eight cylinders are arranged in series, with a power of 150 horsepower. The gasoline consumption depends on the quality of the engine. Yesterday, the three vehicles, GC1 and GC3, used a total of 110 liters (approximately 30 gallons) of gasoline from Shanghai to Hangzhou, while GC2 consumed 160 liters. One gallon of gasoline can allow one car to travel more than four miles. Unfortunately, the reporter is a layman in this field and cannot report in more detail.

 Finally, it should be mentioned that ordinary trains are always delayed, but yesterday the gasoline train did the opposite, arriving "early." On the way back to Shanghai from Hangzhou, it arrived in Jiaxing 24 minutes early and arrived at the West Station a quarter of an hour early. Because the time is fixed, we had to stop in Jiaxing or the West Station to wait. Station Chief Huang of Jiaxing Station said: "The operating time will be adjusted immediately after the driving time is accurately deducted."

### Foreign Trade Gradually Expands; Large Quantities of Goods to be Exported

With the stabilization of foreign exchange rates, foreign trade has gradually begun to expand. Hu Yunqiu, the director of the Foreign Trade Group of the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau, stated that in order to attract foreign exchange for imports, reduce trade deficits, and stabilize currency values, efforts should be made to promote the export of native products. Currently, tung oil, hog bristles, casings, wool, cowhide, tea, and other commodities have markets abroad, but costs are still too high, quality is not yet refined, and transportation is difficult, all of which need to be improved. Furthermore, if commodity inspection procedures can be handled quickly, it will also be a convenience for exporters. In addition, the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau will soon have a large batch of seized goods that can be exported after inspection is completed.

### Yangtze River Demobilization Transport; Deployment of Small Steamers and Wooden Boats

### Death of Mr. Ren Shigang

Another Weakness in the Industrialists

Mr. Ren Shigang, Chairman of the Board of the China National Products Company and General Manager of the Wuhe Weaving Factory in this city, passed away at his residence on Sappho Road at 1:30 PM yesterday (the 17th) due to illness. The remains were sent to the Chinese Funeral Home on Haig Road, and the coffin will be sealed at 3:00 PM tomorrow (the 19th). Mr. Ren was from Cixi, Zhejiang, and was known for his love of learning. After graduating from the University of Hong Kong, he devoted himself to operating industrial enterprises, being cautious and honest, and strictly self-disciplined. He was especially kind and amiable in his dealings with people. Unfortunately, several years ago, he suddenly suffered from high blood pressure due to overwork. He consulted famous doctors, but ultimately could not be cured. He died at the age of 52. In addition to the two projects mentioned above, Mr. Ren also served as Chairman of the Cuizhong Manufacturing Factory, Renyi Hat Factory, and Mainland Leather Factory. He was about to develop his ambitions when he suddenly passed away, which is a major loss to the industrial community of our country.

### The Main Culprit in the Corpse Case is Escorted from Suzhou to Shanghai; Captured While Hiding at His Wife's Parents' Home

A Repeat Offender; Lin Buwu Was Never a Good Person

[Our Newspaper] After the corpse case at the Taishan Apartments on Xiafei Road was solved, the murderer Lin Buwu fled to Suzhou. On the morning of the 16th, he was finally arrested by the detective team of the Judicial Section of the Wuxian Police Bureau in the Stone Pavilion Lane in Taohuawu. Yesterday, the Lujiawan Branch sent personnel to Suzhou to escort the suspect back to Shanghai. The details are summarized as follows:

Wang Zhengzhong, an Accomplice in the Case

Since being captured in the Yianfang Lane on Yidingpan Road on the 12th, the suspect Lin fled without a trace. The police officers handling the case at the scene immediately went to Lin's residence at No. 27 to search. As a result, they obtained more than a hundred photos and many communication addresses. After careful study by Zhao Peijin, the Director of the Branch Bureau, it was determined that he had undoubtedly fled to the Beijing-Shanghai area. Director Zhao then sent official letters to the police bureaus in Kunshan, Suzhou, and other places, along with Lin's photo. Yang Huaichun, the Director of the Wuxian Police Bureau, received the official letter and instructed Tian Wenzong, the Section Chief of the Judicial Section, to order Cao Anchang, the Captain of the Debt Enforcement Team, to strictly check the travelers coming and going in various hotels. On the evening of the 14th, when Cao led officers and police to review the circulation book at the Tianran Hotel outside the gate, he glimpsed a traveler named Weng Songquan, which aroused suspicion. He then strictly asked the waiter about Weng's appearance and clothing, and showed Lin's photo. After the waiter confirmed that it was the same person, but did not know where he had gone. At this point, each officer knew that Lin had indeed come to Suzhou. After dawn the next day, Captain Cao sent police officers to investigate everywhere. Until the afternoon, an informant reported back to the team that Lin and his wife

Were Hiding in Taohuawu

At No. 37, Stone Pavilion Lane, the home of his father-in-law Xu Changgen (Xu is a staff in the JinCheng Hotel Relief House). At around 3:00 AM on the 16th, Cao led police to the address and knocked on the door several times. The person who opened the door was Lin's wife, Xu Luoyun. He immediately asked if her husband was there. Xu replied, "Yes," and was asleep. The plainclothes police officers rushed in. At that time, Lin was sleeping soundly in bed and was captured without resistance. A new-style No. 3 revolver and eight bullets were found under his pillow, already loaded. He was taken back to the police station for detention. On the morning of the 16th, after Director Zhao of the Lujiawan Branch received a long-distance telephone call from Director Yang of Suzhou, Director Zhao ordered Xue Minjie, the Acting Section Chief of the Criminal Section, Ni Jiafeng, a plainclothes patrol officer, Ma Bingzhang, a staff member, and Zhang Jun, a police chief, to take Wang Zhengzhong's wife, Wang Lu, on the 3:00 PM slow train to Suzhou to escort him back. They arrived in Suzhou after 7:00 PM, met with Director Yang, and stayed overnight. Yesterday morning, Acting Section Chief Xue made a long-distance telephone call to Shanghai to report the situation to Director Zhao, and confirmed that it was indeed Lin Buwu. They took the 2:30 PM express train to Shanghai in the afternoon. At that time, they were deeply afraid that the suspect would be cunning and that accidents would occur in the train, so Police Chief Zhang Jun jointly restrained him to prevent him from escaping. At this time, the suspect was wearing a blue cotton robe, torn cotton pants, and a Russian hat.

When the Suspect Lin was Escorted into a Carriage in Suzhou

The suspect Lin pulled down his Russian hat to cover his face, revealing only his eyes. This case had caused a sensation in Suzhou, and the onlookers along the way blocked the road. After arriving at the North Station, he was taken to a police car and driven directly to the Lujiawan Branch. Deputy Director Yu of the General Bureau attached great importance to this case and went to the branch bureau at around 4:00 PM. After the suspect arrived at the bureau, he personally conducted a preliminary trial and ordered him to be detained pending investigation. According to the suspect's confession, after escaping in Shanghai West on the 12th, he went to Wang Zhengzhong's home on Yaozhujiao Road, took his wife Xu Luoyun, and walked to Zhenru. That day, he took a train to Wuxi, stayed overnight, and then took a train to Changzhou, where he also stayed overnight. On the 14th, he returned to Suzhou and stayed in Room 209 of the Tianran Hotel. Because he read in the newspaper that the situation was tense, he moved to his father-in-law's house the next morning. He originally planned to stay for a day or two and then disguise himself and go elsewhere. According to Deputy Director Yu, the suspect had committed many theft cases in the past and was sentenced to ten years in prison fifteen years ago. He had also participated in the puppet organization under Xiong Jiandong and served as an adjutant. He was truly an evil demon who killed without blinking an eye. The suspect's arrangement for the shooting of Laoqi also had its clever and meticulous aspects. By luring a woman to an overly remote area,

The deceased would definitely not want to go, which would easily lead to exposure. Therefore, luring her to the highest floor of the Taishan Apartments for the shooting was a safe method of "seeking tranquility in the midst of chaos," so he was able to escape calmly afterwards. The director also told reporters that the time the report was received after the case occurred was 4:55 PM. The time the entire case was solved and the main culprit Lin Buwu was escorted back to Shanghai from Suzhou was also 4:55 PM, which can be said to be a coincidence. This case caused a sensation in Suzhou and Shanghai and became a topic of conversation in the streets and alleys. From the occurrence of the case to its conclusion, it only took a week, which can be said to be extraordinarily rapid.

### Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Municipal Association Established Yesterday; Connecting Specialized Talents to Promote Municipal Development

[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai branch of the Chinese Municipal Association held its inaugural meeting yesterday afternoon at the 9th floor of the Wing On Department Store. More than 100 members including Xi Yushu, Huang Boqiao, He Dekui, Zhao Zukang, Zhao Zengjue, and Gu Tiyang attended. Mayor Qian also personally attended to give instructions. Chairman Xi Yushu reported on the preparation process, saying that

When the Chairman Got Married in Beijing and Shanghai, he had summoned me personally, and provided detailed instructions on the association's organization and the selection of personnel for preparation. Mayor Qian said in his speech that he was humble and said that municipal administration was not his specialty. He hoped that after the establishment of the Municipal Association, people in the association who were concerned about municipal administration could provide assistance from time to time, so that the association could become a bridge between the people and the municipal government. Huang Boqiao said that Shanghai is

An International City. He hoped that the association could work hard and become a bridge between Shanghai and the international community. Zhao Zukang said that Shanghai was previously divided into several districts, each with different jurisdictions, and often only sought to cope within its own district without considering the city as a whole. For example, the recent heavy rains and flooding were due to the lack of an overall plan in the past, making it difficult to remedy today. In addition to hoping that the colleagues of the association would work with the municipal government, he also hoped that the association could become a bridge between the local and central governments. Tong Hangbai hoped to pay attention to the economic problems of the municipal government and how to

Distribute Fairly. Deputy Mayor He said that he was participating as a member and hoped that everyone would pay attention to the serious situation of the current labor unrest. He also said that times are different, and it is appropriate to study whether the excessive density of population between cities is appropriate. Then, the articles of association were passed, and a declaration of establishment was issued, stating that the purpose of the association was to connect municipal talents, study municipal academics, and promote municipal development. He hoped to enable the citizens and the municipal government to communicate their opinions, awaken the public's universal understanding of democratic politics, and arouse their interest in municipal research. The conference also paid respect to Chairman

Xiao with a telegram, saying: "Chairman: The rivers and mountains are forever stable, the cities are rebuilt, leading the founding of the country, and moving forward. This branch was officially established on March 17, remembering the hard work of eight years of struggle and feeling the heavy burden of the three mountains. Special telegram to pay tribute, endless admiration (omitted below)". Subsequently, Xi Yushu, Huang Boqiao, Zhao Zukang, Yin Tiyang, Zhao Zengjue, and others were elected as directors, and Pan Gongzhan, He Dekui, Shen Shihua, and others were elected as supervisors. The association has reached more than 200 members, and it is said that academic lectures and thematic seminars will be held soon, and publications will be compiled and printed.

### Local News

### Fire at the Hudong Gasoline Depot

[Our Newspaper] The former US military gasoline depot at No. 520, Yuanfang Road, Daming Road, Hudong, next to the Gonghexiang Wharf, suddenly caught fire at 3:10 AM yesterday. More than ten pump trucks from the Central Fire Brigade rushed to the rescue, but unfortunately, the amount of gasoline stored was too large to be controlled. By about 9:00 AM, the fire had subsided slightly, but the embers had not been completely extinguished. It is reported that the oil in the depot was completely destroyed, resulting in huge losses. As a result, the three huge buildings in the depot were completely destroyed by the fire, causing the trams on Lines 7, 8, and 10 that ran through the area to be temporarily cut off. The police authorities are investigating the cause of the fire.

### Social Services; Colleagues of Chuansha Elementary School Express Grievances About Working Selflessly on an Empty Stomach

Hoping that the Local Authorities Will Quickly Raise Funds to Maintain Education

Dear Editor: I am writing to your newspaper on behalf of my colleagues at the Elementary School in Chuansha County to reveal the treatment we get, which is so poor it’s unbelievable. The salary for this semester is $18,500, but we have not received it yet. Last year we only received $2,050, and we received it at the end of December when prices were high. The last three months of last year (November, December) and January of this year are still nowhere to be seen. Fortunately, the school gives us 60 pounds of rice a month, which we use to maintain our personal food intake. We think of the country, the society, and the children’s education and have never stopped or gone on strike. It’s because we do not stop or go on strike that the government ignores us. The authorities are just waiting for us to stop or go on strike. If we have a major responsibility but receive such meagre treatment, do you think it's okay? We beg you to write a postscript.

(Editor’s Note) What Mr. Chen described is likely not only the situation in Chuansha County. I dare say the same situation exists in many countries. It’s a fact that there is no funding after the war, but after the recovery, the local authorities must find ways. Education is a very important industry, and it is wrong for the young elementary school teachers to work selflessly on an empty stomach. We hope the local authorities find ways to maintain education costs, and we ask all the teachers to think about the bigger picture and not to cause any accidents, so as to safeguard the holy education industry.

### Answering Readers

(Note) Readers should try to be as succinct as possible with their inquiries. Lengthy, continuous writing is bothersome for both parties. It would be best to list in table format, such as on the first line the name, age, and gender; on the second line the cause of the illness and a brief history; and on the third line the points to be answered. This way, the editor and consultant can understand the inquiry at a glance and will not feel inconvenienced.

Wu Jisheng asks: My younger brother joined the war of resistance two years ago and was unfortunately injured. A bullet pierced both legs, entering through the right leg and exiting through the left. At that time, he immediately felt that the lower part of his left leg had lost sensation and could not move. After medical diagnosis, it was discovered that the right leg was unharmed, but the femur in the left leg was pierced and the lower part was fractured, damaging the nerves. He was placed in a splint and confined to bed for three months. Although the bones were connected, they were not perfectly aligned. After removing the splint, the knee was stiff. After a week of strong pressure, it could be bent. The area below the ankle still had no sensation and could not move, so he can only use crutches. Over time, the muscles in the knee contracted and could not be straightened again, and the muscles also became thinner. He is in great pain and requests advice on medical treatment.

Dr. Zhang Zhongming replies: For your brother's condition, an X-ray should first be taken to observe how the fractured femur in the left leg has healed. The inability to move the lower leg and the lack of sensation are due to muscle atrophy from prolonged disuse or local nerve damage. Massage and diathermy physical therapy should be used, which may be effective.

Sang Zibiao asks: My older sister has been feeling tired and weak in her limbs since last spring, and gradually felt unable to support herself. She went to Siming Hospital for diagnosis and treatment. According to the doctor's diagnosis, she had early-stage pulmonary tuberculosis and needed to have air injected. In June, the illness suddenly affected her intestines, causing continuous diarrhea and frequent, intermittent pain after eating. She was sent to Guangci Hospital for medical treatment. Over the past five months, her condition has worsened, and she has become as thin as a rail and cannot walk. Please ask a specialist doctor to give a good prescription, and I will never forget it.

Dr. Zhang Zhongming replies: Your older sister suffers from pulmonary tuberculosis and intestinal tuberculosis. It is necessary to focus on nutrition and increase resistance. Besides this, there is no particularly effective medicine.

Lu Shoufan asks: Five or six years ago, I suddenly suffered from a disease similar to eczema, which appeared on my buttocks. When it appears, it is unbearably itchy and must be treated with hot water. After scalding, the skin hardens, breaks when scratched, and oozes yellow water. Although I have had injections, taken medicine, applied ointment, and had X-ray and electrotherapy several times, I have not been cured. According to the doctor, it is a bacterial reproduction within the skin cells, which is quite difficult to treat. If your column can provide me with a good prescription, it would be a blessing to the public.

Dr. Zhang Zhongming replies: Apply 10% salicylic acid ointment to the itchy area, which may be effective. Your letter mentions that X-ray therapy was ineffective, which may be due to the number of treatments.

Commercial News

### Financial Situation Gradually Stabilizes; Securities Speculation Becomes Heated; A Summary of Commercial and Financial Conditions for the Week

The financial trend last week was still relatively stable. The Bank of China continued to sell gold, and speculators have been greatly threatened. The market price has stabilized at around 1.6 million. The Bank of China's US dollar exchange rate has also been fixed at 2020 unchanged. However, the China stock unity bond had small fluctuations outside the market. Because the authorities claimed that the principal and interest of the unity bond would be repaid, another method was set, which was to wait until it was found out whether there was any robbery by enemies and puppets. This caused speculators to be greatly frustrated, triggering a tragic decline. Class C once plummeted to 1,250 yuan, but idle funds were picked up at low prices. At the same time, there was also news that the unity bond could be used to transfer new government bonds, so it soon rose again. On Wednesday, it once reached 1,900 yuan. Due to insufficient support, it once rebounded and then hovered downward. China stocks were unusually strong at the beginning of the week. American Asia Yarn Mill all hit new highs, and the Guangdong merchants actively moved forward, gradually moving towards a peak. Until Thursday, with the competition between bulls and bears, the fluctuations were huge. As a result, it was slightly lowered. On Friday, it returned to being strong. On Saturday, idle funds shifted, so the China stocks, which had been profitable for several days, became weak, and the foreign stocks, which had been idle for many days, changed to be strong. As for other commodities, the price of food rice rose sharply, which attracted the most attention. However, according to investigations by relevant parties, the recent stock of food in this city is very thick, enough for several months. Moreover, the Grain Administration Bureau has purchased large quantities of rice from rice-producing areas at home and abroad and transported them to Shanghai. Recently, due to continuous rainy days, the source is slightly scarce, and merchants are raising prices on the pretext. Furthermore, the participation of general idle funds and disrupting the market is also one of the reasons for the rising rice prices. It is said that the authorities will have new measures for the use of excess currency in order to guide idle funds back to the right track.

The raw silk on the last week’s question, initially stimulated by the rising wind of gold and stocks, the raw silk sales of the guest gang were good, and new buyers and short coverings were enthusiastic, and the market price rose. After entering, the actual digestion of the main customers such as Yuehan and other gangs turned sluggish, and the yarn factories received by the construction company opened night shifts and actively produced, so that the supply of chips in the market was abundant, and the situation turned sharply downstream. The highest for the entire week was 2.92 million for the 60s sunlight on Wednesday, and the lowest was 550,000 for the 10s nine fish on Saturday. In terms of support, the 20s special Shuangma fell 95,000 yuan from the previous week, the most significant. The others fell by 35,000 yuan for each level of yarn.

The cloth market situation is very mediocre and lacks color. As a result, there was no much change from the previous weekend, only a rise and fall of one or two thousand yuan. Because of the construction of the company’s procurement monopoly, especially the demand for fine velvet raw materials, the fine velvet market was strong and the coarse velvet market was weak. Except for the Zihua brand, which was 8,000 yuan cheaper than the previous week, the other fine velvet flowers such as Mittelin, Brazilian Flower, Tongzhou Dachangji, etc., were all priced at 5-6,000 yuan or more.

### Promoting the Export of Chinese Silk; Flower and Leaf Loan Still Pending

Since the opening of foreign exchange, import and export traders have a basis for purchasing and settling foreign exchange, so international trade is gradually developing. For example, silk, which is a major export of our country, has been continuously shipped out by Jardine Matheson for about 800 dans. Other foreign companies also have good suction. Dachang recently purchased 100 dans, with a maximum value of 2.75 million and a minimum value of 2.3 million. As for domestic sales, an average of about 20 dans are traded every day. As for tea exports, tea groups are actively carrying them out. Once the loan problem is resolved, they can implement procurement. There are now many trading companies operating tea exports.

### French Ministry of Industry Supplies Foreign Exchange for Perfume Industry

[Reuters Paris, March 17] The French perfume industry has been greatly affected due to a lack of foreign exchange for perfume oil, which cannot be imported. The Ministry of Industrial Production has now approved the supply of 300 million French francs for the import of perfume oil. It is estimated that the price of this perfume oil after being made into perfume can be as high as 1.2 billion French francs.

### A Discussion on the Value of Unified Bonds

— Yan Jiarong

Having recently read Mr. Shi's request in the "Reader's Opinions" section of your newspaper on the 13th, asking the authorities to clarify national debt policy, I feel that not only are public bond professionals distressed, but bondholders are even more confused. In my opinion, unified public bonds inherently possess an undeniable value both legally and ethically. I present four points below.

(1) In 1933, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt devalued the U.S. dollar by 40%, mandating that all debts be repaid in legal tender. This caused dissatisfaction among national debt bondholders, leading to disputes with the government and the globally impactful "Gold Clause Cases." This case lasted two years and was adjudicated by the Supreme Court on February 18, 1935. The court divided national debts into two parts: (1) private debts should be repaid in legal tender as mandated; (2) the national debt portion should be repaid based on the currency value at the time of issuance. Following the precedent of allied nations, unified bonds should maintain their pre-war value.

(2) When the July 7th Incident broke out, the Ministry of Finance ordered the stock exchange to close (excluding institutions specializing in national debt and stock trading at the time). All buying and selling in the August-September period was settled at a price of 70 yuan. The Ministry of Finance maintained national credit, which is admirable. Since 70 yuan was established as the standard price at that time, it is reasonable to maintain this value without question.

(3) Since the victory of the War of Resistance, we have entered the path of national reconstruction. Various construction projects, development initiatives, and troop reductions all require significant expenditures. During this period of imbalance between national revenue and expenditure, there are only two options: increasing taxes and issuing national debt. To encourage the public to actively invest in and willingly purchase national debt, the original value of the bonds must be guaranteed. Otherwise, the public will view public bonds with suspicion, hindering future issuances.

(4) The 25th Year Unified Public Bonds were a reorganization and reissue of old bonds. Bondholders have already suffered losses, a number of incalculable proportions. They have endured this pain silently and without complaint, given the circumstances of the nation. Now that the War of Resistance has been won and the nation has joined the ranks of the great powers, with vast amounts of enemy and puppet assets confiscated, it would be unjust to subject bondholders to further unwarranted losses.

In conclusion, these four points sufficiently demonstrate that unified bonds should inherently maintain their original value. This is my opinion, and I hope that experts from across the country will enlighten me further.

[Note: The current market price of unified bonds has long exceeded its face value, and the increase is extremely high. The reasons given are often the same as Mr. Yan's. Therefore, it is printed as above. For the government's view, please refer to the discussions at the Second Plenary Session.]

### Economic Briefs

The Ministry of Finance's Cotton Yarn and Cloth Control Bureau was originally scheduled to close at the end of this month, but the closure work has not been completed. The closure period will therefore be extended.

The Ministry of Economic Affairs' Coal and Coke Management Office recently disclosed the following information on the supply of coal: February production was 89,880 tons, and the allocation was 8,919 tons. Due to the closure of most factories in Chongqing and the gradual decrease in population, Chongqing's coal reserves are becoming increasingly abundant, with many shipments to Yichang, about 3,000 tons per month.

According to responsible persons from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the takeover of enemy property in Taiwan has been more successful. The Taiwan Administrative Governor's Office only dispatched a few people to take over economic enterprises and then instructed them to continue production before reorganizing them. This ensured that factory production was never interrupted. This differs greatly from the methods used to take over enemy property in Tianjin, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Wuhan, resulting in much greater efficiency.

The United States has officially abolished wartime import and sales restrictions on hog bristles. Import regulations for cattle, sheep, horse tail hair, and horse manes have also been cancelled due to the end of the war. However, applications are still required. Current U.S. hog bristle reserves are sufficient for several months, and a large quantity of hog bristles is expected to be shipped from China between June and July of this year.

China's request to the United States for a large loan for Yangtze River water conservancy projects is contingent on China increasing silk production to 500,000 *dan* per year, the level of Japanese annual production. Currently, China's total annual silk production is only about 110,000 *dan*. The central authorities are planning to expand raw silk production to meet international market demand.

In addition to establishing a real estate department, the Central Trust Bureau has recently established a barter trade department to expand foreign trade. The main tasks are to handle the export of mineral products from the Resource Commission and the export of tung oil, Shantou oil, and hog bristles from the Trade Commission's Reconstruction Corporation.

According to sources from British Overseas Airways Corporation in Shanghai, the company will open a new route from Hong Kong to Japan, with a stopover in Shanghai. It is reported that a group of key personnel and experts from the company have arrived in Shanghai and are actively preparing. This is expected to be the first step in the relationship between the British aviation industry and our country.

### Butterfield & Swire Company: Efforts to Restore Shipping Routes: Four Coastal Routes Inaugurated: Total of Fourteen Ships

The Hong Kong Far East United Shipping Bureau has officially announced its closure, with management returning to the original shipping companies. Butterfield & Swire Shipping Company has begun operations at its original location, actively preparing for business recovery. The company manages two major groups of ships, "Blue Funnel Line" and "China Navigation Company". "Blue Funnel Line" ships are responsible for transportation between Hong Kong and the United Kingdom and its territories. Five major routes have been decided: Australia Route, London Route, Pacific Route, New York Route, and Liverpool Route. However, there are very few "Blue Funnel Line" ships currently available. The only ships capable of operating are the *Adis* sailing to Australia (via Singapore) and the *Eridanus* sailing the Pacific Route to Vancouver. The other routes will have to wait for new ships to arrive in Hong Kong before they can be assigned. Therefore, there is currently only one sailing per month. The "China Navigation Company" ships suffered heavy losses during the war. There are now only fourteen ships, all between 1,500 and 2,000 tons. The routes are mainly coastal routes to Shantou, Shanghai, Xiamen, Guangzhou, Tianjin, etc., and overseas routes to Singapore, Haiphong, Siam, etc. The following routes have been assigned for inauguration: Guiyang (Hong Kong-Shantou route has passenger seats), Shandong (Hong Kong-Shanghai route has no passenger seats), Yuezhou (Shanghai-Haiphong route has no passenger seats), Jinan (Hong Kong, Shanghai, Tianjin routes have passenger seats), Hanyang (Hong Kong-Shanghai route has no passenger seats), Niuzhuang (Hong Kong-Shanghai route has no passenger seats), Beihai (no passenger seats in Shanghai), Fuzhou (Shanghai-Hong Kong route has no passenger seats), Shengjing (route to be determined, has passenger seats), Foshan (Hong Kong-Guangzhou route has passenger seats), Nanchang (Hong Kong-Vietnam route has no passenger seats), Suiyang (has passenger seats on the way to Hong Kong), Ninghai (no passenger seats in Shanghai), Anhui (Hong Kong-Singapore route has passenger seats, undergoing repairs in the dock), fourteen ships in total. However, only the Hong Kong-Shantou, Hong Kong-Shanghai, Hong Kong-Guangzhou, and Hong Kong-Siam routes are currently operating. The Hong Kong-Xiamen and Hong Kong-Singapore routes can be restored soon, depending on whether there is cargo transportation after the routes are restored. The Taikoo Dockyard is actively recovering and has begun repairing ships. If trade in various regions is smooth in the short term, each route will have at least one or two ships operating.

### On the Issue of Returning Cotton Cloth: A Discussion on the Handling of Enemy and Puppet Assets

— Chen Shaozu

The issue of returning surplus cotton cloth, although part of the handling of enemy property cases, has already attracted public attention. If this situation persists in a state of uncertainty, it cannot be said that it will not affect the clothing of the people of Shanghai. The Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau initially approved the issuance of instructions, but then the 49th meeting of the Enemy and Puppet Property Review Committee reversed the decision, stating that the requisition of cotton cloth by the Puppet Cotton Association had taken place over a long period, and that since the receipt of the cotton cloth, much of it had been moved or sold, making it impossible to verify. The review resulted in a decision that it would be difficult to approve the return. (As reported in the news section of this newspaper.) Government agencies issuing contradictory approvals to the people only undermine public confidence in the government. Regardless, the fact that businesses in this city were forced to buy cotton cloth by the enemy and puppets shows a clear pattern of coercion and duress, rather than voluntary transactions or free will. Legally, the owners are entitled to request its return. According to Article 92 of the Civil Code, a declaration of intent made under duress may be revoked. Further, according to the interpretation of the law, this is not limited to gratuitous acts. Remunerated acts can also be subject to the provision. Therefore, regardless of whether the act is remunerated or unremunerated, the declaration of intent may be revoked, as the law does not stipulate that the declarant must not receive consideration for the act to be invalid or revocable. Furthermore, Article 4, Paragraph 1 of the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Measures states: "Property originally belonging to citizens of this country, allied nations, or friendly nations that was forcibly seized by Japan should be returned to the original owner, provided that clear and reliable evidence is available." This provision is based on the principle of freedom of will in civil law. The Bureau has already submitted the cotton cloth return case to the Legal Advisory Committee for discussion, and it has been deemed that, in accordance with the handling measures and legal viewpoints, the return should be approved. The review committee's decision to suddenly reject the people's request is confusing. Is it that the handling measures are not applicable to cotton cloth? Or do the review agency and the handling agency have differing opinions on the handling measures that have been revised and promulgated? This leaves the people at a loss.

As for the review opinions of the 49th review meeting, the points regarding the impossibility of verifying the cotton cloth purchased in the past due to the fact that much of it has been moved or sold since its receipt are not sufficient to be factual obstacles to the request for return. Legally, whether a property is a specific item or a non-specific item, a replaceable item or a non-replaceable item, its owner is entitled to request its return if it has been taken illegally. Cotton cloth is a non-specific item, and it is also a replaceable item that can be dealt with using items of the same type, quantity, and quality. Furthermore, in this case, the businesses that were forcibly bought out are willing to take back their remaining cotton cloth according to the proportion of their share. Since there is no dispute between the interested parties, the authorities do not need to verify the original item as the subject matter of the return. In fact, there are no difficulties. In short, the merchants' request to retrieve the surplus amount of this cotton cloth does not violate the law, is not contrary to the handling measures, and there are no difficulties in fact. In order to alleviate the hardships of the people, the authorities have the necessity to return it.

### Ministry of Education Supervisors' Inspection Guidelines: Vice Minister Hang Reviews Inspection Reports from Various Supervisors

[Our Nanjing Correspondent] Before the war, the Ministry of Education's Supervisory Office had fewer than ten supervisors. During the War of Resistance, in 1940 (Republic Year 29), due to the promulgation of the National Education Implementation Act, each province and city had a five-year plan to promote national education. The Ministry of Education needed many personnel for supervisory work, so it amended the Education Organization Regulations.

Qualifications of Supervisors: Regarding supervisors, there were six hired supervisors, four reappointed supervisors, and thirty assigned supervisors. Hired and senior supervisors received the same treatment, but the qualifications for hired supervisors were generally that they had served as presidents of colleges or universities, heads of education departments, or equivalent positions. Hired and senior supervisors were assigned areas of inspection by the Ministry, mostly related to higher education matters above the college level. Assigned supervisors generally inspected primary and secondary schools and local education.

Scope of Inspection: Pei Lin, after taking office as president of Henan University when the War of Resistance was won, is now in the Ministry of Education with only hired supervisors Hao Gengsheng, Peng Baichuan, and Ren Tai. The senior supervisors are Zhong Daozan, Chen Dongyuan, Shen Yizhen, and Huang Longxian. Of the thirty assigned supervisors who have departed for inspection, Li Zhigang is inspecting education in Peiping and Tianjin, Zhang Danxiang is inspecting Jiangsu and Nanjing, Ding Xianzeng is inspecting Shanghai and Nanjing, Chen Zongying is inspecting Fujian and Taiwan, Qiu He is inspecting Jiangxi and Hunan, Cai Ruoshui is inspecting Anhui, and Cheng Kuanzheng is inspecting local education in Zhejiang and Shanghai. It is also heard that in order to handle daily affairs, the Supervisory Office must have one member in charge each time. The current person in charge is Supervisor Zhong Daozan.

Meeting for Review: [Also reported] Vice Minister Hang of the Ministry of Education recently convened a meeting in Nanjing for various supervisors in Beijing to review their inspection reports, with department heads and above also in attendance. Supervisor Cai Ruoshui reported on the inspection of education in northern Anhui, and Supervisors Ding Xianzeng and Zhang Danxiang reported on the completion of inspections of education in Nanjing City. It is heard that Supervisor Cheng Kuanzheng has already submitted a report to the Ministry, having inspected education in Hangzhou and Jinhua, and is now inspecting Lanxi. Supervisor Cai Ruoshui must still go to southern Anhui for inspection. Supervisors Ding Xianzeng and Zhang Danxiang must still go to Jiangsu for inspection. It is also heard that Senior Supervisor Shen Yizhen, currently in Chongqing, will come to Beijing to work at the Ministry within days. (Fool)

Resurrection defeated Central Cadre easily, and Police Third defeated Qingquan. It is expected to end by the end of May. The Fourth Motor Transport Battalion in the senior division has famous players such as Wang Shixuan and Liao Dihang, and has always held the top position in Chongqing. The CU Combined Team is composed of CU teachers and students, with strong players Wang Liquan and Ren Shuheng. Their performance is excellent and they once defeated the National Association. This time, they are the only strong opponent of the Fourth Motor Transport Battalion in the senior division.

They are probably no match for the Fourth Motor Transport Battalion and the CU Combined Team. The Changfeng team of CU is strong in the regular division, but it is unknown who will emerge victorious. The strength of the high school boys and girls teams is average because Nankai did not participate.

### Special Education News New Undertakings in International Cultural Cooperation (Part 2)

National Teachers College Establishes Educational Materials Office

Summary of Plans The main points of the educational materials office's work plan are as follows: (1) Hire several special instructors and correspondents from domestic and foreign educational and cultural institutions to organize an educational communication network to facilitate the supply of materials. (2) Collect and purchase materials on education at all levels across the country since the Anti-Japanese War. (3) Design and draw various charts to show the actual situation and problems of education at all levels in each year for the research of teachers and students of the college and for the reference of people in the education field. (4) Translate the aforementioned materials and charts into English for the reference of foreign educational and cultural institutions. (5) Clip and paste educational news and treatises published in newspapers. (6) Carry out cooperation matters with the Teachers College of Columbia University: A. Compile and exchange domestic and foreign educational bibliographies. B. Purchase two copies of various educational materials, one for exchange and one for self-preservation. C. Organize and keep the materials exchanged by Columbia University.

Brief Account of Work The Educational Materials Office has not been established for a long time, and all work is in its initial stage. Due to the limitations of objective conditions during the war, it is not easy to fully develop the original plan. The following is a brief description of the work that the office has already started to clarify the current situation: (1) Subscribe to Newspapers: The office has searched for all important newspapers in major cities. In addition to collecting materials, it has a scheduled opening time every day for public exhibition, and many teachers and students come to the office to consult them. (2) Solicit and Purchase Books and Periodicals: The office sent letters to educational administrative and publishing institutions across the country to solicit and purchase publications of an educational nature; and entrusted educational and cultural figures in various places to search for and purchase them on their behalf. Subsequently, it received reply letters from the Education Department and other institutions, donating more than 600 kinds of educational laws, statistics, plans, reports, magazines, and books. It also directly selected and purchased various educational books and magazines from various bookstores. (3) Draw Charts: The office referred to the statistics on education and created new types of school system diagrams and educational opportunity distribution charts. It has now completed six diagrams of the school systems and educational opportunity distribution of China, Japan, the United States, France, Italy, and the United Kingdom. The diagrams of the school system and educational opportunity distribution of Denmark are being drawn. In addition, in order to meet the needs of teaching, it has drawn diagrams of the organizational relationships at all levels of the county, a table of the evolution of education in various periods of human history, an activity table for the four grades of the primary school department of national schools, a diagram of the current school system in China, a diagram of the school system in Switzerland, a diagram of the school system in Denmark, a diagram of the relationship between gene combination and heredity (three diagrams), a diagram of the heredity of sex-linked traits, a diagram of the determination of personality and gender, and a diagram of cell reproduction and division, a total of twelve diagrams. (4) Carry out Exchanges: The China school system and the chart of abandoning weaknesses and using strengths to distribute opportunities created by the office have been redrawn with the latest statistical figures and a large English explanation. Director Zhu also personally wrote an English paper on Chinese national education, and Professor Zhu Youxu, director of the Department of Education of the college and instructor of the office, wrote an English paper on Chinese secondary education. They will be sent to Columbia University in the United States as the first batch of exchange materials. In addition, the various educational books and periodicals purchased by the office have been prepared as another set for Columbia University, and will be shipped to the United States by mail after sea transportation is smooth. The weekly magazines donated and purchased by Columbia University will also be shipped in batches at that time. In addition, (5) clipping news, (6) compiling bibliographies, and (7) collecting materials are also being actively promoted. In short, although the progress of various tasks of the Educational Materials Office is extremely difficult in the wartime environment, all staff members have worked hard and have gradually achieved results. Now that the Anti-Japanese War has ended victoriously and the objective conditions after the war have improved, the office will not only gradually complete the established plan, but also expand the scope of work in the hope of contributing to educational research. If people in the national educational and cultural circles cooperate, advocate, and provide assistance in various ways, then the development of this new undertaking of international culture is unlimited.

### Attlee and Bevin Broadcast to the Business World to Form a Production General Staff

— Special Correspondent Xueyan from London

This newspaper's 2nd day airmail

The most important issue internally in Britain right now is how to speed up production and restore Britain's prosperity. Seeing that American goods are already being sold to the world market, while British factories are still struggling with coal shortages and labor shortages, people can't help but panic. Prime Minister Attlee gave a pep talk to the nation on the evening of March 3rd, appealing to business people and laborers to do their best to increase production. At the same time, during the second week of March, from Attlee to Bevin and Morrison, a group of important people will all come forward to give public speeches and review the production situation in Britain. British government officials usually express their opinions in the upper and lower houses of Parliament, and there are not many broadcasts, let alone timely and festive broadcasts, so this large-scale mobilization can be regarded as the greatest effort. In addition, the business and labor circles are also mobilizing at the same time to form a national production general staff in the British business world. Its task is to provide advice to the government on general production policies and the direction of production priority. Its members are composed of labor representatives and factory owners, each accounting for half of the number. In the future, this organization will definitely make more contributions to increasing British production.

Monotonous Recipes Cause Complaints

After a great war, there must be a lean year. This saying is the same in ancient and modern times, at home and abroad. The war ended last year, and now there is famine everywhere. The British food list was already too monotonous, and there were complaints from all sides. However, seeing the famine situation in India and the British-occupied areas of Germany, it is really pitiful. The British Isles are fortunate to be spared, and they can be content and comforted by this. Among the famine areas, the famine in Europe is the most concerning to London, because it is close to the water tower. It is said that there is no way to deal with the situation in Germany within the British-occupied area, and it can only reduce the daily food ration per person. The amount of food that each person can get now is 1,550 calories per day. The calories normally needed to maintain health are 2,000 calories, so the current standard is not enough to maintain health. If it is reduced by another one-third, it can only barely maintain until starvation. However, there is no solution to this situation, so not only will it not be improved in the near future, but it may also need to be shortened further. According to general estimates, it may once be necessary to reduce the current ration per person by two-thirds. In other words, each person can only eat two slices of thin bread and a sweet potato every day. The situation is really serious, so the commander-in-chief of the British occupying forces, Montgomery, urgently requested the British government to quickly allocate ships to transport food for emergency relief, and see if there will be a way to improve the situation in the future.

London Raises the Housing Problem

The housing problem is extremely serious in Britain. All serious problems will inevitably become the focus of debate between the Conservative and Labour parties. Recently, in the London City Council, the issue of housing construction has been raised again due to the competition for two seats. The Conservative Party said that the Labour Party promised to solve the housing problem when it was campaigning last year, but now that it has been in power for half a year, it is clear that it cannot fulfill its promise. But the Labour Party said that the Labour Party has built more houses in half a year in power than the Conservative Party has built in ten years, and then cited many figures. From a practical point of view, both sides are right. There is no doubt that the severity of the housing problem in Britain this year is still far from being solved. However, the Labour Party said that it has achieved better results in its half-year term than the Conservative Party in ten years, which is also reasonable, because the housing problem was not a problem before, so construction was a private matter and not the concern of the government, so naturally there was no housing. During the war, although housing had become a problem, the government did not have time for this, so it did not build housing either. It was not until the Labour Party came to power last year that it listed housing construction as one of the most important policies, so it is natural that the results are better than the Conservative Party.

The conflict between the two parties on the construction issue is not limited to this. The Conservative Party believes that private construction companies are large in scale and highly efficient, so the government should entrust them with the problem and subsidize them. The Labour Party is against it, believing that this move is to make private companies rich, so it advocates that the government should directly hire workers to handle it. According to the housing problem report recently released by Health Minister Bevin, a total of 1,909 houses have been built in the six months since the Labour Party came to power. Among them, 1,116 were built by private companies, and 352 were built by government workers. Conservative newspapers sarcastically headlined, "Bevin's gang has only built 352 houses so far." Newspapers have been reporting on anti-British incidents in India, Egypt, and other places, demanding the withdrawal of British troops. A newspaper very keenly thought of the housing problem and joked that London's landladies must be very happy to hear these news, because British people from all over the world are being driven back home, and renting out houses must be a good deal.

Clothing Allocation Points Increased

Although the recovery of British industry is considered very slow, from the government and parliament to the opinions of newspapers and magazines, they are all discussing this issue and worrying about how to restore British prosperity. But in reality, London today has made obvious progress compared to the autumn and winter of last year. For example, the number of points for the clothing rationing system has been generally increased by four points per quarter since March, that is, previously each person only got 20 points per quarter, but now they can get 24 points. At the same time, the value of points has been increased for many items. For example, a woman's coat used to require 18 points, but now it only requires 12 points. In addition, many special wartime restrictions have also been lifted in March, such as the number of pockets and buttons that can be made on a man's suit, which were limited during the war to save materials. As a result of the restrictions, London suits did not have buttons on the cuffs, because the buttons on the cuffs were purely decorative, and naturally there was no right to exist during the war. However, since March, this restriction has also been lifted. No one will care how many buttons you like to put on your suit or how many pockets you sew on. In addition, there were restrictions on the height of women's shoe heels during the war. From March, this restriction has also been lifted. Women's shoe heels can be as high as they can reach the sky. It is said that you can do whatever you want, and the country will no longer bother you to save heel materials.

Anti-Franco Is Already a Trend

With the defeat of the Axis powers, Fascism is also about to die. Now, in the whole world, the only remaining remnant that is still playing the Fascist card is the Franco regime in Spain. At the same time, it has also become the object of scorn from all countries in the world. Since the United Nations Conference passed a resolution to sever ties with the Franco regime, the British Trades Union Congress issued a declaration cursing the Franco regime and demanding that the government sever ties with it. Tomorrow, the Socialist Party in Brussels will launch a demonstration against Franco. The left-leaning parties in France and the Spanish republicans who have fled overseas curse Franco every time, as if they are not satisfied if they don't curse him once. But strangely enough, Franco seems to be very proficient in the philosophy of small countries. He laughs at the curses, and I will be an official myself. He calls himself an orphan in Madrid, and his position as head of state seems to be very stable. The people who curse him can only do so outside the borders of Spain. Within the borders of Spain, at least for the time being, they cannot move him at all. Several Spanish revolutionaries who participated in the war against Germany in France recently sneaked into the Spanish border and plotted to do something, but Franco caught them and dealt with them according to the law. This really touched the public outrage in the world. France took the lead in proposing that the Franco regime be submitted to the United Nations Security Council for discussion, but France is not a big deal. If France really wants to take action, as the French Foreign Minister told the French Parliament, it must first obtain the consent of Britain and the United States, so as long as Britain and the United States do not agree, Franco can still be indifferent. Now the United States suddenly advocates taking action. It advocates that the United States, Britain, and France consult with each other to form a caretaker government based on broad democratic foundations, so that if the Franco regime suddenly dies, the original team can send people to Spain to handle the aftermath. Although this move does not directly overthrow the Franco regime with the power of the United States, Britain, and France, and establish another government, it assumes that the Franco regime will fall, and clearly shows the sympathy of the United States, Britain, and France on the new government's side, so it is very likely that it will provide assistance and convenience. If the United States, Britain, and France really take action, Franco may not be able to support it. Among these three countries, Britain had previously announced that it did not advocate overthrowing the Franco regime by external force, but that the Spanish people should work hard on their own. The effect of this statement was tantamount to announcing a non-aggression promise to Franco, so Franco was very relieved in the past six months. But now the United States has come out to lead, and has published ten documents captured in Germany, pointing out Franco's collusion with Hitler and others during the war, and that Franco has requested the occupation of Gibraltar, etc. As a result, the British government has also changed its attitude and joined the joint declaration of the United States, Britain, and France, encouraging the Spanish people to rise up peacefully and take the power of Franco and form a caretaker government based on democracy. Franco's regime, at this point, may not be able to support it any longer. Also, Archbishop Spellman of New York is currently in Madrid on the orders of the Pope, and it is unknown whether he is having any practical contact. (March 2nd)

### Major Anglo-Soviet Debate: Existing Twenty-Year Treaty of Friendship, Bevin Proposes Extension to Fifty Years

For the past month or two, the focus of attention in London has been the United Nations conference. Within the UN conference, the most attention-grabbing events have been the series of major debates in the Security Council. These included the Iran-Soviet dispute, the Soviet proposal for the withdrawal of British troops from Greece, the Ukrainian request for the UN to send an investigation team to determine if British troops in the Dutch East Indies endangered international peace, and the joint request by Syria and Lebanon for the withdrawal of foreign troops from their countries. With the exception of the last proposal, the others were all focal points of contention between Britain and the Soviet Union. Fortunately, Britain prevailed in these debates, and the Security Council's final decisions were, in effect, based on British opinions. With the end of the conference, the British felt relieved, as if the world could finally be at peace. There was an opportunity to carefully reflect on the consequences of these Anglo-Soviet disputes.

Diplomatic Debate Continues Non-Stop for Two Days

During the UN conference, Foreign Secretary Bevin was too busy, so the parliament had no time to debate diplomatic issues. Now that the conference has ended this week, the parliament scheduled the 20th and 21st as two whole days to exclusively debate diplomatic events. The focus of the debate naturally centered again on Anglo-Soviet relations. Both the ruling and opposition parties expressed many opinions, unanimously acknowledging that Anglo-Soviet relations were not satisfactory, and also unanimously admitting that this was a regrettable phenomenon. British newspapers also published editorials these past two days, commenting on Anglo-Soviet relations, and expressing opinions similar to those in parliament, which clearly shows how anxious Britain is about the unsatisfactory state of Anglo-Soviet relations.

The debate was initiated by former Minister of State for Near Eastern Affairs, MacMillan (from the opposition party), who highly praised Foreign Secretary Bevin's success in the UN Security Council. Many people then spoke, the most important being Minister of State Noel-Baker, former Foreign Secretary and current opposition leader Eden, and current Foreign Secretary Bevin. Although the positions of the two parties differed, their opinions on policy towards the Soviet Union were almost identical. Therefore, it was less of a debate and more of a clarification of Britain's unified position on the Soviet Union. In summary, they hoped that the Soviet Union would understand Britain's attitude towards it, believe in Britain's goodwill, and appreciate Britain's sincere desire to cooperate. At the same time, Britain also believed in the Soviet Union's sincerity in wanting to cooperate with each other in the post-war world. However, as Eden said, "The Soviet Union needs cooperation, but the cooperation it needs seems only to be on its terms. This is not going to work; sooner or later, it will lead us into difficulties." Eden also said, "The Soviet Union's allies cannot tolerate the Soviet Union constantly claiming it needs unity, almost magically, while pursuing its own policies, completely disregarding the feelings and interests of its allies."

Anglo-Soviet War Seems Impossible

Indeed, it is absolutely certain that Britain and the Soviet Union need to live in peace and cooperate with each other today. Both sides understand this very well; there is no ambiguity. The only problem is how to reconcile interests, especially not to let one country pursue its own narrow interests while disregarding the interests of the other. If anyone believes that today's Anglo-Soviet conflicts will lead to war, they are fools. At least in the short term, it is not only impossible but also unimaginable. In fact, many of the tense Anglo-Soviet conflicts are based on the belief that Britain and the Soviet Union will not go to war. For example, Foreign Secretary Bevin, in response to Eden's debate, said, "Some say that we are inclined to go to war with the Soviet Union, or that we are bound to do so, but I cannot imagine Britain and the Soviet Union going to war under any circumstances. The Soviet Union's territory, from the Kuril Islands to its satellite countries, is an incomparably large continental country. I don't know what we have to fight over. This idea has never entered my mind, and I am sure it has not entered the minds of any of my colleagues in the government." Bevin even said that when he went to Moscow at the end of last year, he explained Britain's friendly intentions towards the Soviet Union to the Soviet leaders. He suggested to the Soviet side, "We now have a twenty-year treaty of friendship between us. If you are willing, we can extend the twenty years to fifty years."

We believe that Bevin's words are sincere and frank. If we carefully analyze the debate in parliament by both the ruling and opposition parties in Britain over the past two days, and the resulting newspaper commentary, we can clearly see that the entire country acknowledges that Anglo-Soviet relations are not currently good. At the same time, even if relations are bad, they believe that they will not immediately lead to war, because neither side wants this. Britain, in its position, is confident that it harbors no hostility towards the Soviet Union, and especially has no intention of supporting its neighboring small countries to deliberately make things difficult for the Soviet Union, hoping that the Soviet Union will not be suspicious. Conversely, Britain also has many interests around the world and hopes that the Soviet Union will also take them into account and respect them. Britain feels that it has made many concessions to the Soviet Union, but there are also limits to what it can concede. For example, the Iranian issue is one such limit. Britain hopes to adjust relations with the Soviet Union, but Britain's position on what it cannot concede is also very firm. In the post-war world, Britain sincerely hopes to have friendly cooperation with the Soviet Union. But the problem is whether there is a way to adjust where interests conflict.

Speaking of Anglo-Soviet conflicts, we know that this is an old story going back half a century. Whenever the two countries' power simultaneously expands, interests will intersect and conflicts will arise. The locations of the conflicts, in the era of Imperial Russia, stretched from the Near East all the way to the Far East. The Anglo-Japanese Alliance at the beginning of this century was the result of Britain's desire to use the power of a newly emerging Japan to restrain the development of Imperial Russia's power in the Far East. In the Near East, Anglo-Soviet relations also added many disputes to diplomatic history. Until the outbreak of World War I, the Soviet Union underwent a revolution and was busy with internal problems, having no time to expand outward. Therefore, although Anglo-Soviet relations did not improve much, the conflicts of interest caused by mutual expansion of power temporarily came to a standstill. During the second half of World War II, Britain and the Soviet Union became allies, and during the war, they cooperated seamlessly, and relations were indeed friendly. However, after Germany was defeated, the Soviet Union took advantage of its victory to seek development in all directions, and then the contradictions and conflicts between Britain and the Soviet Union arose again. From the disputes over the problems of the Polish, Yugoslav, and other governments-in-exile, to the pile of debates in the recent UN conference, it can be considered to have reached its peak. We know that the Five Foreign Ministers Conference held in London last year ended without results. Bevin had a direct conflict with Molotov at this conference. By the end of the year, the Three Foreign Ministers Conference was held in Moscow. Regardless of what officials said, the Three Foreign Ministers Conference was actually to remedy the failure of the Five Foreign Ministers Conference and was a preparatory conference for the eve of the UN conference, seeking coordination among the three major powers. As a result of the conference, Moscow believed that it was very successful because the Soviet Union's requests were largely achieved. Washington also considered it quite satisfactory; compromises had been reached. However, the public opinion in London generally expressed dissatisfaction and was quite saddened. As for the reason for the dissatisfaction, Britain believed that the Moscow conference was only a mutual compromise between the United States and the Soviet Union, and Britain's participation was only incidental. Britain's hopes were completely ignored, and the Soviet Union was unwilling to make any concessions to Britain. When the Moscow conference was convened, the independence movement in northern Iran had a raging momentum. Therefore, Britain had high hopes for the Moscow conference, hoping to find a solution to the problem in the talks. During the conference, the British ambassador to Iran also specially rushed to the Soviet capital to be available for consultation. However, as a result of the Soviet Union's unexpectedly tough attitude, Britain's original hopes could not be achieved at all. Until the Iranian issue was raised in the Security Council at this UN conference, the Soviet Union finally admitted that Iran and the Soviet Union would continue to negotiate directly and would report to the UN in the future. Following the Greek, Indonesian, and other cases, Britain was considered very successful. Therefore, the frustration that Britain had suffered in Moscow seemed to be vented, and now it can calmly review Anglo-Soviet relations and seek to remedy the shortcomings in diplomatic relations.

The Biggest Key to Anglo-Soviet Conflict

The Near East is indeed Britain's lifeline to India. The integrity of the British Empire depends on this lifeline. Therefore, it is natural for Britain to value the safety of this transportation line and not allow major powers to threaten it. Conversely, the Soviet Union is seeking warm-water ports everywhere, and Iran is its bridge to the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean. The Soviet Union has never let go of this when it has the power. As early as the era of Imperial Russia in 1907, Britain and Russia, as a result of the conflict of interests in Persia, Afghanistan, India, and other areas, had signed an agreement. Among them, the part about Persia can be used as a reference for our Iranian problem today. According to the Anglo-Russian Agreement of 1907, the sphere of influence of Persia was divided into three parts: the northern part, including Tehran and Isfahan, was the sphere of influence of Imperial Russia; the central part was a buffer zone; and the coastal areas, including Bandar Abbas leading to the Persian Gulf and Seistan, the passage leading to India and Adakhan, were the sphere of influence of Britain. If we compare this treaty's provisions with the division of Anglo-Soviet spheres of influence in Iran today, it seems that Britain's sphere of influence today is even larger than it was then. However, we should not forget that the Anglo-Russian Agreement of 1907 was only one of many agreements. The division of spheres of influence at that time was the result of various trade-offs. In analyzing the conflict between Britain and the Soviet Union in Iran today, we should not be too rigid in adhering to this view. It is said that Bevin's proposed method for resolving the Iranian dispute at the Moscow conference was for Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union to send a delegation to investigate within the Soviet military-occupied area, but this was rejected by the Soviet side. According to Bevin's statement in parliament on the 21st, he still supports the idea of sending an investigation team in the future if possible. From the method proposed by Britain, it has been very moderate from the beginning. In the future, if the conditions are right, Britain and the Soviet Union may still be able to compromise in Iran.

Bevin Reviews Soviet-Turkish Border

The second point of conflict between Britain and the Soviet Union in the Near East is in Turkey. We remember that when the Three Foreign Ministers met in Moscow, the Soviet newspapers suddenly attacked Turkey very strongly. Bevin called it a war of nerves. Later, Turkey's attitude became firm, and it seemed quieter. This time, when reviewing Anglo-Soviet relations, Bevin also talked about the Turkish issue. He said, "It is regrettable that the Soviet-Turkish border is still a matter of controversy." As for the Dardanelles Strait, he said that Britain is "prepared to consider jointly revising the Montreux Convention by Turkey and the Soviet Union themselves or with the participation of other allies. In the revision, we urgently hope to maintain the international nature of the waterway." This shows that the Turkish issue may be under discussion, and it also illustrates the limit of Britain's concessions. According to a report from American newspapers, when the five foreign ministers were drafting the peace treaties with Italy and other countries, the Soviet Union demanded that Tripolitania be a Soviet trusteeship, otherwise it demanded to occupy the Dodecanese Islands. If this statement is true and realized, then Anglo-Soviet conflicts may sow new seeds of conflict in the Mediterranean region in the future. From the above review, we can see that the Anglo-Soviet conflict of interests is not accidental, but it can all be resolved through negotiations with a spirit of mutual concession. When debating, the situation is turbulent because both sides are deeply convinced that it will not lead to war. Especially since we know that Britain is a pragmatic nation, why not seek a solution through diplomatic means if there are problems that can be discussed? Therefore, after a period of tension, it is very likely that Britain and the Soviet Union will seek a compromise and understanding in diplomacy. (February 23rd)

### Sea Wall at Jinshanwei Collapses, Urgent Repairs Needed!

[Our paper's dispatch on the 16th] The Jinshanwei sea wall in Jiangsu Province, where the borders of Songjiang and Jinshan counties meet, the embankment is the point where the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway is impacted by the flow of Hangzhou Bay, and the water force is comparable to Haining in Zhejiang Province. Since the enemy troops landed in the area in the 26th year of the Republic [1937], the seawall construction has fallen into disrepair, and the embankment body has been collapsing day by day, especially at the two sites of Fangdun and the Weijiadun Bathing Beach, which are the most dangerous. The embankment body of the Fangdun section has been destroyed. The piles that used to protect the embankment were close to the embankment body, but now, because of the crumbling of the stone, the embankment body is collapsing day by day and is far away from the embankment piles. The scouring and erosion are very worrying. (See Figure Two.) As for the Qijiadun section, its steel and concrete construction has also been destroyed. This project was built in the 22nd year of the Republic [1933], originally filled with stones, flush with the embankment surface, but now many places have been destroyed by flushing, and the embankment body is gradually collapsing, which shows the urgency of the water force. (See Figure Two.) Once the above two places collapse, not only will the national highway be interrupted, but the residents of several counties along the coast will be in a flooded country. More than one million acres of rice-producing farmland in Pudong and Punan will be irrigated by saltwater, making it impossible to cultivate, and the impact on the people's food supply is unimaginable. It is heard that all parties are hoping to purchase materials and start construction as soon as possible to avoid future troubles. It is heard that the authorities are planning emergency repair strategies.

### Anglo-Soviet Understanding Will Definitely be Established, There Will Be No Darkness As Imagined By Stalin

Since the situation in Iran took a sharp turn for the worse, and after Churchill and Stalin turned against each other, the British have developed a dual psychology: on the one hand, they are quite willing to face reality, no matter how unpleasant the reality is; on the other hand, they do not believe that the relationship between Britain and the Soviet Union has been as dark as Stalin has said. What the British most hope for is to clarify the current crisis. What the British are most concerned about is the true goal of Moscow. The movement of the Red Army within Iran, the discord between the great powers, are secondary. The general public expects that Foreign Secretary Bevin will be able to obtain answers to the following questions that trouble him most after the UN Security Council convenes on March 25: (1) To what extent is the Soviet government currently expanding its territory, disregarding whether others oppose it? (2) How can a clear answer be obtained from Moscow? (3) Are there limits to the tolerance of Britain and the United States? (4) To what extent can the official policies of Britain and the United States cooperate in this regard? (5) If the deadlock on the Iranian issue cannot be broken when the Security Council convenes, will the Soviet Union withdraw from the UN mechanism? (6) If so, what will be the consequences?

Foreign Secretary Bevin has repeatedly stated that the British government will not change its policy until a proper solution is reached through international institutions. Most of the British people apparently share the same attitude.

The recent crisis between Britain and the Soviet Union is easily compared to the Munich Conference. The Soviet propaganda's attack on Iran, accusing Iran of intending to invade nearby Soviet territory, is indeed too similar to the Nazi propaganda at the beginning.

Practical theorists in London can be divided into two factions: one believes that the Soviet Union does not want to cause any more disputes, and the other believes that the Soviet Union believes that Britain or the United States will never use force again, and that it can take advantage of this opportunity. To sum up, it is still generally believed that an understanding with the Soviet Union can eventually be established sooner or later. (Reuters, London, March 17)

### Local Dispatches

Suzhou: Coal Shortage, Request for Additional Allocation of Electricity. The Suzhou Electric Power Plant is short of coal. Ordered coal has not been delivered on time. Except for the lights, which are maintained with difficulty, it is still difficult to restore the use of electric motors, which has affected industrial production. In particular, most of the workers who depend on it for a living are requesting the factory to resume work as soon as possible. Now, more than ten guilds such as papermaking and rice milling have written to the County Chamber of Commerce for relief. The Chamber has already telegraphed the higher authorities on the 16th, requesting additional allocation of electricity fuel and designating it for the use of motors in various factories in order to quickly restore production.

The head of the warehouse of the 35th warehouse of the Suzhou Receiving Group of the Ministry of Military Administration, Yuan Zihua, colluded with staff members Chen Dingxuan, Wang Mengliu, etc., and stole and sold large quantities of materials from the warehouse, such as cement, iron pots, white sugar, asphalt, matches, and glass. Later, because the news leaked, they illegally tortured Gu Shiguan, a villager in Xikuatang Township. Because he was beaten, Gu was determined to take revenge, and he joined Yu Renyuan and witness Wang Rongmin (warehouse cook), etc., to report to the local military police. After the military police sent personnel to arrest and interrogate, they were confirmed to be true and were detained. A document was prepared to ask the superiors for verification. Later, the team received a letter from the receiving group of the Ministry of Military Administration, and the prisoner was brought back to handle the handover procedures. Unexpectedly, the prisoner took the opportunity to escape. The receiving group has now requested the superiors to issue a warrant for his arrest.

Changshu: Two Criminals of a River Robbery Case Arrested. The police detective team purchased a line to capture the thieves who robbed the Yangtze River vessel of the State-owned China Merchants Bureau outside Hupukou, Wang Shenghua, Shi Baosheng and other two key criminals who were selling more than 400 bags of flour. According to the confession, He Fuxing, Wang Ping, Wang Haihai, Li Baosheng, Chen Jindada, Chen Fusheng, Wang Jinsheng, and other seven criminals who bought the stolen goods were arrested in Xiyang and other places. After interrogation, it was found that He Fuxing and others had indeed mistakenly bought stolen goods. In addition to ordering them to pay the full value of the 400 bags of flour, they were released on bail. As for Wang Shenghua and Shi Baosheng, they were decided to be handed over for investigation.

Wuxi: Second Meeting of National Assembly Representatives. The National Assembly Suzhou Representatives Friendship Association convened its second meeting at the County Chamber of Commerce at 10 am on the 14th. Li Tieping and other ten people attended and discussed the following matters: (1) On the revision of the Five-Five Draft Constitution, it was unanimously advocated that the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution should be the principles. Any revision that violates this principle will be corrected. (2) The representatives of this province are scattered in various places. On the political reforms in each place, it was decided to concentrate them at this meeting and send them to the provincial government or the central government for adoption. (3) The Communist troops in northern Jiangsu are wantonly harassing the area. How should we save them? It was decided to forward the request to the central government to immediately transfer the Communist troops in northern Jiangsu. (4) There are more than one million refugees in this province. How should we provide relief? It was decided to: 1. Telegraph the Executive Yuan, ordering the General Relief Administration to quickly send a large amount of materials for relief. 2. Write to the Su-Ning Branch, publicizing the distribution of received materials to local newspapers at any time. 3. Suggest that the provincial party and government jointly form a Suzhou Refugee Relief Committee. (5) Prepare to set up a democratic publication and a Shanghai edition of the daily newspaper. The rest are omitted.

Taixing: Calling for Adjustment of Councilors' Candidates. The list of interim councilors in this county was previously announced by the provincial government. It is learned that since reading the list, the people of the county have been discussing it. The County Chamber of Commerce was originally a legal national organization, and there is no lack of talent. The election of the councilors this time did not get a seat, which is obviously controlled by a few people. It is a pity. Yesterday, several representatives of various industry associations went to the county party and government agencies to petition, calling for them to comply with the situation and quickly forward the report to find a way to adjust it in order to comfort the public.

Guangming: Fundraising to Improve the Lives of Prisoners. The Prison Coordination Committee, which was established by the county's judicial office, previously decided to raise funds for improving the lives of prisoners and adding a few necessary houses. It is learned that the fundraising work is now being carried out separately by the members of the committee, and local philanthropists are enthusiastically contributing.

Special Issue on Production and Construction

### How to Stabilize Production

— Wang Lu

Labor issues are quite serious in the industrial world. In some industries, because the sales of products are divided into peak months and off-peak months, production is very uneven. Because production cannot be averaged, more labor is needed in peak months and less labor is needed in off-peak months. In order to understand the needs of secondary production, during the peak months, it is not hesitate to use higher treatment to dig up labor from the same industry. Factory A digs up labor from Factory B, and Factory B digs up labor from Factory A, so that workers cannot work with peace of mind. At the same time, workers often make requests for increased treatment during peak months. This situation is very unfavorable in the process of production.

General factories also want to have a prescribed production volume all year round, based on the production volume in peak months, storing goods produced in off-peak months or finding ways to increase sales. However, during the adjustment period, there is really no power to support all the purchases of raw materials and the expenses such as labor wages. If you borrow from ordinary banks, you cannot afford the huge interest.

According to the author's opinion, the best way is for the national bank to implement low-interest loans and low-interest mortgages to the industrial sector, or to universally promote acceptance drafts, so that factories can calmly manage the annual production volume. Because the production volume can be fixed, there can be a comprehensive budget, and the treatment of workers can also be fixed or gradually improved with the living situation, so that they can live and work in peace and contentment, and there is no need for factories in the same industry to dig up labor.

Because there are many types of factories, it seems that we can start with industry associations at the beginning and make adjustments. Research and then implement, I don't know what the wise people of society think.

### The Self-Education of American Workers

— Qinghe

None of us can deny that the general public's knowledge level in our country is indeed too shallow, which is why progress is so slow.

The way American workers not only organize themselves but also educate themselves can serve as a valuable reference for our country.

The oldest workers' education institution in the United States is the "Workers Education Bureau," established in 1921. It has branches throughout the United States. Their work includes printing books and pamphlets and publishing workers' education news. District representatives are stationed in various parts of the United States, and their primary work is to establish discussion classes. Each discussion session lasts from one to five days. The number of participants varies. Sometimes there are twenty to thirty people for in-depth study, and sometimes more than six hundred people participate. In June 1940, the tenth research class and the New Jersey Labor Association held a meeting at Rutgers University, with three hundred participants attending for five days to discuss the topic "Labor and the World Crisis."

The second national workers' education institution is the "American Labor Education Service," which regularly provides research materials to various parts of the country and answers inquiries about trade unions, workers' education committees, labor universities, libraries, etc. It also publishes pamphlets and bibliographies, assists trade union education departments in planning courses and hiring teachers.

The education department of an International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union was established in 1916. By 1936, education departments had been established in fifty-eight cities across the country, with 22,000 people participating in classes or group studies. The courses included English, parliamentary procedure, public speaking, current events, the history of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union, economics, labor issues, etc.

The government also pays close attention to workers' education. In 1933, the government's Workers' Design Bureau specifically established a workers' service program to promote workers' education, and special supervisors were appointed in thirty-five states to encourage and organize workers' education.

### Increasing Profits

— Li

Efficiency expert Mr. Carson once said that to increase the net profit of a business organization, the first thing to do is to increase sales. If sales can be increased by 20%, then profits can also be increased.

He said that, for example, a streetcar needs to carry sixteen passengers on a trip to cover its costs. If it only carries fifteen people, it will lose money; if it carries nineteen or twenty people, it can make a profit.

Therefore, his argument is that even a small increase in sales can lead to profits. Expanding sales, even by a very small amount, can have a significant impact.

### The Omnipotent Doctor of Engineering

— Jiaxi

In the research department of General Motors in the United States, there is a Mr. Kettering, who is sixty-nine years old. Working in the research department of General Motors for fifty years is not a big deal; it is only a good starting point. The endless future is very small.

But Mr. Kettering has made great contributions to General Motors. He invented the automatic starter, which made American vehicles take a step forward; the ethyl gasoline he invented helped the Second World War to win; his diesel locomotive brought new developments to the railway; he also invented the artificial heater, which made it easier for doctors to diagnose syphilis and other serious diseases.

These great achievements, in Kettering's own view, are not surprising, because he has a philosophy of life: "When you think you are satisfied, you will not progress." His eternally dissatisfied spirit makes him eternally young. He is educating himself to become a doctor of engineering, which is a new profession in the scientific community. He hopes to study methods of treating pain. His aspiration was sympathized with by Mr. Sloan of General Motors last year, who donated four million yuan as a fund, which has been established in New York.

Mr. Kettering tells others that the only way to obtain facts is to use the method of experimentation. He also does experimental work at home anytime and anywhere. His wife drags him out to see a movie. By the time he returns from the movie theater, the program list is already covered with various symbols. He once used his wife's egg beater to test the coils of a radio. Experiments are everywhere.

Li has the following truths that are worth remembering:

"Research work is 10% experimentation and 90% getting along with colleagues harmoniously."

"All research work is 99.9% failure, and only one success is needed to achieve great success."

"If you want your experiment not to fail, you must continue to work hard until the last experiment before the experiment succeeds."

China's industrial circles really need talents like Mr. Kettering.

### Introduction to Business Administration

— Xu Baiyi

(1) Balanced Management

Business administration seems to be a relatively new term in China. In fact, its inception and development have only been in the last fifty years. Because industry is becoming increasingly developed, it can no longer lack organization and systematic management methods, and must utilize scientific, orderly, and systematic management methods. Therefore, business administration can also be called scientific management.

The biggest principle of business administration is to achieve the highest possible efficiency with the minimum amount of capital and labor. Therefore, business administration can be effective after it is implemented in a smooth organization; in a business that is in dire need of salvation, it can have significant effects once adopted. There are many business administration experts abroad whose job is to study the shortcomings of an organization. After finding the shortcomings, they use the principles of business administration to reform and adjust them, or implement various new programs, so that a dying business can embark on the road to revival.

According to the opinion of general experts, it is much easier to create a new organization than to reorganize an existing business. Because creating a new paper weaving can be done step by step, completely planned, and step by step, in an orderly manner, without constraints; in an existing organization, there are often many accumulated habits that are not easy to reform at once. However, in terms of interest, being able to save a dying business and repeat a vigorous phenomenon is more interesting and can better show the expertise of an expert.

However, it is passive work to rescue a business that has reached a dangerous situation. The active work should be to implement various new management programs at the beginning of the establishment, or when it feels that the progress is not very smooth, which can save a lot of time, manpower, and monetary losses.

Usually, when talking about business administration, it refers to an entire work. Because business administration must take into account all departments of an organization. In the past, in many organizations, because a certain part developed very rapidly, the other parts could not keep pace, which would create a disconnection phenomenon. For example, if the sales part of a factory is making rapid progress, but the production part cannot always have sufficient production to meet the needs, the result will inevitably disappoint customers, or switch to buying products from other factories. Conversely, if the production volume of a factory is quite large, but the sales part cannot fulfill its responsibilities, then the resulting goods cannot be sold, and the capital cannot be circulated.

The most important thing in business administration is the average development of each part. Each part must have appropriate management talents, and the management talents of each part must take close cooperation so that the business can develop rapidly. At the same time, the leaders of Bogo must have management knowledge and specialized knowledge of various parts.

There are many business organization leaders who are promoted from accounting directors. What they know cannot go beyond the scope of accounting. Therefore, they are not familiar with the production aspect or the sales aspect. Because they are not familiar, they cannot make appropriate arrangements. Even if there are shortcomings, they cannot be rescued or improved.

Or he is a person who has been promoted from the sales director to the leader. What he knows only belongs to the business aspect, so he cannot understand the actual situation of the production part or the accounting part.

There are also many leaders who have no knowledge of the various parts of business administration at all. Therefore, when he handles affairs, he relies entirely on his ideals or past experiences, knowing what is but not why. If he handles it successfully, he does not know because of which points it is successful; if he fails, he does not know because of which points it is failed. This is indeed a great loss for the individual of the leader. It is also very dangerous to entrust a business to such a leader.

Regarding the application of business administration principles, general business administration experts believe that applying the principles can save time, avoid mistakes, and unnecessary losses, and at the same time, it can make affairs simple and proceed smoothly.

After the Second World War, the United States was eager to help several backward countries embark on the road to industrialization. They were prepared to send experts to assist in everything. They called these experts people who know how to do it (Know How). This knowing how to do it is knowing how to apply the principles and putting the principles into practice.

In terms of the application of principles, a leader must not only understand the principles of business administration himself, but also must make his colleagues understand the principles of business administration, and must also make full use of their knowledge of business administration, and unite them to become a powerful driving force for a business.

In order to adapt to the environment and cope with abundance, modern industry and commerce must implement balanced management. The so-called balanced management is Balanced Management to make the three most important parts - Production, Sales, and Financing - have close ties.

These three parts must not only have close ties, but also have average development. Whether it is work, personnel, or even expenditures, they must be distributed very evenly after the entire planning.

If we study several successful organizations, we can definitely find that their three main parts are developing in an average and connected state.
