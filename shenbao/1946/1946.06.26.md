### Legislative Yuan Passes Amnesty Bill; to be Promulgated and Implemented After Approval by the Chairman; War Criminals and Traitors are Not to be Pardoned or Have Their Sentences Reduced

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] The amnesty bill, of nationwide concern, has been passed by the Legislative Yuan. It will be promulgated and implemented after the detailed amnesty implementation measures are jointly drafted by various courts and the Executive Yuan and submitted to the Chairman of the National Government for approval. The timeframe is expected to be no later than mid-next month.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] In today's session, the Legislative Yuan, after two hours and ten minutes of intense debate, passed the amnesty bill, a matter of concern to all quarters of the country, by a majority vote of forty-three to fourteen. Since the Executive Yuan submitted the bill to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation, it was resolved in the 299th session of the Yuan on May 11 to "defer deliberation." Subsequently, due to a temporary motion by Committee Member Li Jinfang and thirty-two others, the 302nd session of the Yuan on June 18 resolved to "reconsider" it and return it for review. In today's 303rd session, the Criminal Law Committee and the Legal System Committee presented their review reports. After Committee Member Liu Kejin, the convener of the Criminal Law Committee, finished explaining the review report, a heated debate ensued. When the discussion began, committee members first debated whether petty corrupt officials should be pardoned or have their sentences reduced. Supporters argued that petty corruption was often driven by economic hardship and should be forgiven. Opponents argued that pardoning corruption would only worsen corruption in the future. However, most speakers supported the amnesty bill itself. Some argued that the current situation was not the right time for an amnesty. Supporters countered with arguments from various sources, engaging in a fierce verbal battle that nearly became a free-for-all. Finally, some committee members felt that the matter should not be delayed further to avoid causing problems and that a decision should be made promptly. Therefore, at 12:35 PM, Chairman Sun of the Yuan submitted the matter to a vote. Of the fifty-seven committee members present, forty-three raised their hands, and the amnesty bill, of national concern, was finally passed by a majority.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] The 303rd session of the Legislative Yuan was held at 9:00 AM on the 25th in the Yuan's meeting hall. Sixty-eight committee members attended, with Chairman Sun presiding. In addition to two hours of heated discussion and the passage of the amnesty bill, the other important bills passed included: (1) Amendment to the Organic Statute of the Trademark Bureau of the Ministry of Economic Affairs; (2) Amendment to the Organic Law of the Military Advisory Council of the National Government; (3) Amendment to the Organic Law of the Ministry of Interior; (4) Rejection of the Executive Yuan's request for deliberation on the proposal to restrict the establishment of provincial and municipal banks by order; (5) Proposal that laws should be enacted separately according to their nature, and if it is necessary to leave a considerable period after promulgation and before implementation for the purpose of publicity, a separate implementation date should be specified. In addition, the Yuan session today unanimously passed the acceptance of the Charter of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and adjourned at 12:30 PM.

### Military Tripartite Meeting Scheduled for This Morning; Serious Discussions on Troop Reorganization Issues; Xu and Zhou Prepare All Day Yesterday

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] The military tripartite meeting, which concerns the rise and fall of the nation, the prosperity and decline of the country, and economic security, is scheduled to be held solemnly tomorrow morning. The central issues of this troop reorganization include the proportion of reorganization and the troop garrison areas. If the meeting progresses smoothly, it will then proceed to discuss various concrete measures for implementing the reorganization, such as the implementation procedures and dates for the withdrawal of Communist troops from railway lines and coastal ports (including Yantai and Weihaiwei), and the organization and supply of Communist troops after the reorganization. It is said that the government representatives participating in the negotiations on troop reorganization were originally planned to be Chief of General Staff Chen Cheng, accompanied by General Xu Yongchang. However, Chen's health has not fully recovered, so General Xu Yongchang will still attend the meeting. Xu has been reviewing maps for days and, together with senior staff members of the General Staff Headquarters of the Ministry of National Defense, has been personally sorting out various reports related to the implementation of domestic troop reorganization. He has been working day and night and is extremely tense.

### Mao Zedong Accuses the United States; U.S. Believes it is Anti-American Propaganda

[News Agency Report] San Francisco, 25th Broadcast: According to a dispatch from Nanjing, Chinese Communist leader Mao Zedong's accusation that the United States is threatening China's peace and security has caused serious concern at the Marshall Mission here. Marshall declined to comment on the matter, but a U.S. spokesman said that Mao's statement was purely propaganda. The Communist Party Chairman's accusation of the United States shows that the party has resumed its anti-American propaganda, which will have a serious impact on peace negotiations. Another well-informed U.S. source said that Mao's attack on the U.S. military aid bill to China was particularly fierce, but in fact, the purpose of this bill is to assist both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. He pointed out that about one hundred U.S. officers have been stationed in Beijing for two months, waiting to go to Zhangjiakou after the military conflict ceases to establish a Communist military officer school. If both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party can abide by the agreement, they can equally receive U.S. aid and prevent China from falling into economic chaos.

### The Rumor of a Secret Agreement Between China and the United States is Absolutely Groundless

[United Press, Washington, 24th] State Department officials said that the Moscow radio station's claim that China and the United States had a secret agreement to extend the Lend-Lease Act to November 1947 is completely groundless.

### The News of the Bombardment of Yantai and Weihaiwei is a Communist Fabrication

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] A spokesman for the Ministry of National Defense explained on the 25th: The rumor that our navy bombarded Yantai and Weihaiwei originated from a fabricated report by the Communist New China News Agency from Laiyang on the 20th, intending to slander and confuse the public. In an attempt to seize Qingdao, the Communist army has not only gradually advanced towards the periphery of Qingdao with land forces since the beginning of this month, but also attacked Tuandao on the evening of the 16th with ninety sailboats from the Xuejiadao and Huangdao areas, intending to coordinate with the land forces. Our Qingdao naval fleet, in order to maintain maritime security, dispatched small warships to patrol the Changshan Islands. This is the routine duty of the navy. The Communist New China News Agency used this as an excuse to fabricate rumors, such as claiming that our navy bombarded Yantai and Weihaiwei, which is completely unfounded.

### A Touching Scene for Chinese and Foreigners in the Capital's Continental Hotel; Kui Yanfang and Others Hosted a Press Conference Yesterday; Subei Refugees Sobbed While Narrating Their Suffering

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] A touching scene for Chinese and foreigners was discovered in the Capital's Continental Hotel today. Kui Yanfang and eight others from Shanghai, who came to Beijing to petition, hosted a press conference here this afternoon and explained the reasons for their petition, hoping to obtain "peace" and recognizing the so-called "Xiaguan Incident" as a temporary "misunderstanding," unwilling to increase the current disputes and not intending to file a lawsuit. Zhang Xubo then translated for foreign reporters, especially emphasizing the "Xiaguan Incident." Subsequently, reporters asked about the process by which they were elected as representatives. Kui replied: "I never participated in the election, nor did I go to the meeting, but someone came to tell me that I had been elected because they said that I was involved in charity work, so they insisted that I come." At this point in the report, Cao Dayou, Wu Bingyang, Zhang Jiwen, Wang Benwei, and other Subei refugees came forward to narrate the cruel facts of the Communist army's occupied areas in Subei. They were all landowners and law-abiding common people, but they were forced to flee to other places due to the Communist army's harsh taxes. Among them, the most miserable was Zhang Jiwen, an elderly refugee of seventy-one years old, carrying his seven-year-old grandson. While narrating their suffering, tears flowed with their voices, and he instructed his grandson to kneel down and kowtow to the reporters and representatives, repeatedly saying: "We want to go back!" Kui was deeply moved by this tragic scene, and tears almost welled up in his eyes. He left his seat and went to the seat of the special correspondent of this newspaper in Beijing, saying in a very sincere tone: "What you said is all true, the refugees are really suffering too much!" and said: "I must report their suffering to Chairman Chiang, Mr. Zhou Enlai, and Special Envoy Marshall." The refugees then thanked him with tears and left. Moreover, foreign reporters at the scene today, witnessing and hearing the real situation of the Subei refugees, were greatly moved and gathered and left with reports from the refugees and the special correspondent of this newspaper on the number of refugees exiled from Jiangsu, Shandong, Anhui, and Henan provinces, as well as an analysis of the abnormal psychology of refugees who are disappointed, sad, angry, and have been accumulating for a long time.

Reporters' Speech; Refugees Applaud

[United Press, Nanjing, 25th] "Anti-Civil War" representatives hosted a press conference here today. Acting chief representative Kui Yanfang reported on the "Xiaguan Incident." As soon as he finished, five "Subei refugees" left their seats and came to the seats of the reporters and representatives to detail their personal experiences in the CCP's "liberated areas." One of them pointed to Kui and said: "You are the savior of the people, the savior of the people in the liberated areas!" Kui repeatedly explained that all the representatives were non-partisan and had no ambitions, and were selected by 53 industrial, commercial, and cultural groups, and have always been engaged in social work, and are now eager to promote peace and naturally dare not lag behind others. Kui also promised to raise the refugee issue to Chairman Chiang and Zhou Enlai. Two reporters also tried their best to persuade, and the five refugees returned to their seats. Subsequently, reporters asked the representatives to explain whether the groups they represented were legal (registered and approved by the Ministry of Social Affairs), and gave speeches sympathizing with the refugees. One of them said: The refugees not only beat the representatives, but also beat the reporters. The reporter of the Dazhong Daily, which is run by the Kuomintang, was also among them, which proves that the refugees have no political background. Another reporter narrated the killing of two elderly people by the Communist army, saying: "Fortunately, Shanghai has not been 'liberated', otherwise the elderly would have been killed too." The refugees listened and applauded.

Demanding that the CCP Withdraw from Subei

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] The Nanjing Subei Exiled Refugees' Return Home Promotion Association hosted reporters this morning. Chairman Li Hongru and Zuo Gaokang recounted the atrocities of the Communist army in Subei and said: Since we fled from the Communist area, we have placed great hopes on the National Government. However, today there are disasters everywhere, and the government has repeatedly tolerated and made concessions. We have repeatedly endured, but our hopes have become a bubble. After disappointment, we can only ask the government to take responsibility, ask the CCP to lay down its weapons, and withdraw the Communist army from Subei. Please ask the Democratic League, the Youth Party, and non-partisan social leaders to speak fairly and do fair things. Please ask allies to go deep into the Communist areas to observe. The listeners were extremely indignant. Furthermore, the association solemnly stated that it was unrelated to the "Xiaguan Incident" and agreed that the perpetrators should be punished. The association will set out collectively tomorrow to petition.

Demanding a Stop to the "Three Alls" Policy

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 25th] Subei refugees exiled in Zhenjiang, in order to oppose the civil war, request the central government to stop the CCP's "Three Alls" policy and withdraw the Communist army from Subei so that they can return to their hometowns.

Li Muyu, Chen Jin, and dozens of others were elected and took the night train to Beijing to petition the central government, the Communist Youth Party, and representatives of various parties in the Democratic League, and distributed leaflets along the way: (1) Request the government to stop the civil unrest, (2) Please the government to protect our lives and property, (3) Oppose armed separatism, (4) Oppose the CCP's "Three Alls" policy, (5) Please the CCP lay down its butcher knife immediately.

### Military Grain Reliance on Actual Levy and Supply: Xu Kan Explains the Land Tax Problem; Allocation Amounts for Each Province to be Determined Separately After Investigation

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] Minister Xu Kan of the Ministry of Food, today analyzed for reporters the reasons for the high grain prices and the issues related to levying land tax in kind. He stated that since the victory last year, the 14 million *shi* of military grain that was no longer collected through conscription had to be purchased from the market, giving rice merchants an opportunity to raise grain prices. In contrast, grain prices in the rear provinces like Sichuan and Guizhou, where land tax was levied in kind, were more stable. Earlier this month, the financial revenue and expenditure conference decided to extend the method of levying land tax in kind for another year. Although it is known that levying land tax in kind is an outdated system, and it is also deeply understood that the eight years of war against Japan have caused great suffering to the people, the government has its own unavoidable difficulties. Currently, the demobilization of troops has not been completed, and huge amounts of military grain are still needed for supply. If land tax is not levied in kind, and military grain is still obtained through purchases, it will inevitably deepen the crisis of malignant inflation, and it is unknown to what extent prices will rise. Therefore, levying land tax in kind is an emergency measure before prices stabilize after the war. Once the economy is on track and prices are stable in the future, collection in cash should be restored. As for the allocation of levy and requisition amounts for each province, a detailed investigation of the disaster situation and production conditions in each province is necessary to ensure fairness.

### Asia's Largest Generator Completed Installation in Peiping; Generating 10,000 Kilowatts; Second Unit to be Installed Next Year

[Our Peiping Dispatch, 25th] The Jibei Electric Power Company has installed a 25,000-kilowatt generator, the largest in Asia, in Shijingshan, west of Peiping. This generator is a trial product of Mitsubishi of Japan, named the Rui Yi-style turbine generator. After the machine arrived in Peiping, the Japanese installed only seven-tenths of it in three years. After the Ministry took over, it continued the installation, which took half a year, and was completed at the end of May. However, due to the shortage of materials, only the first boiler could be completed, which can generate 10,000 kilowatts. The second boiler can be completed around this time next year. The company today invited reporters to visit and see the three major features of the turbine: (1) It uses a pulverized coal machine, which crushes hard coal and sends it into the boiler with compressed air, which is more efficient than ordinary coal burning. (2) Ordinary boilers all use bituminous coal, but this boiler is specially made to utilize the Mentougou hard coal nearby. (3) It is manufactured with precision and uses very little coal. The Japanese have turbine generators installed in Harbin, but they are only 15,000 kilowatts. The generator will be officially put into operation at the end of this month and connected to the Peiping, Tianjin, and Tangshan power grid. After this, Peiping's electricity consumption (approximately 20,000 kilowatts) will no longer need to rely on Tianjin and Tangshan, and there will be no fear of shortages. The National Resources Commission also has a five-year power expansion plan. It has sent four American power experts to Tanggu and Tangshan to inspect and decided to build 200,000 kilowatts of thermal and hydroelectric power equipment near Tanggu to meet the needs of heavy industry in North China (especially the Tanggu New Port). The Jibei power grid generates electricity in Peiping, Tianjin, and Tangshan. Tianjin can generate 35,000 to 40,000 kilowatts, and Tianjin uses about 30,000 kilowatts. Peiping can generate 10,000 kilowatts, and Peiping needs about 12,000 kilowatts. Tangshan can generate 15,000 kilowatts, and the city needs about 5,000 kilowatts. They cooperate with each other to supply electricity to various parts of Jibei.

[Central News Agency, United Press, New York, 24th] It is reported that the United States has signed a contract with the China Supply Committee, agreeing to design and build seven central power plants in Shanghai and other places for China.

### Our Ordnance Maintenance Team En Route to Japan Detained by French Troops in Vietnam; Personnel Released After Negotiations, Weapons Not Yet Returned

[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 25th] A company of officers and soldiers of the ordnance maintenance team attached to the Second Honorary Division, with eight transport vehicles, was ordered to travel from Kunming to Vietnam to accompany the division headquarters to Japan. On the evening of the 21st, when they arrived at Phu Lang Thuong, two kilometers away from Hanoi, they were suddenly surrounded by French armed forces. Since this batch of troops entering Vietnam had been formally notified to and approved by the French, we immediately argued against being surrounded by armed forces, but to no avail. They were disarmed and detained in a hospital. All the money and belongings carried by the officers and soldiers were also searched and taken away. At that time, an American reporter happened to pass by the area on his way to Lang Son, and we asked him to notify the American military delegation in Hanoi to assist. Upon hearing the news, the American military delegation immediately made representations to the French military headquarters. On the morning of the 24th, the French military in Hanoi sent military police to Phu Lang Thuong to mediate, return the money and belongings taken from our officers and soldiers, and escort our officers and soldiers to Hanoi. However, the seized weapons have not yet been returned, and our company of ordnance maintenance team officers and soldiers has been detained for three days. After arriving in Hanoi on the evening of the 24th, the batch of officers and soldiers went to Haiphong on the morning of the 25th to report the incident to Division Commander Dai Jian of the Second Honorary Division and will lodge a strong protest with the French.

### Supreme Authorities Issue Order Establishing Judicial Official Recusal Measures: Not Allowed to Serve in Own Province or County

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 25th] Confirmed information: The highest administrative authorities recently noted that many heads of judicial officials in various places are serving in their native places, which not only easily causes disputes but also creates many difficulties in handling civil and criminal cases. To address this, they specifically ordered the judicial authorities to add recusal measures and instructed all levels of the judiciary to comply. After receiving the order, the Ministry of Judicial Administration instructed the presidents of the provincial high courts and the chief procurators to recuse themselves from their native provinces (i.e., not serve in their native provinces), and the heads of the county district courts to recuse themselves from their native counties. After receiving the order, the local High Court, because the president of the court, Zhu Shusheng, and the chief procurator, Mao Jiaqi, are both from Hubei, will be transferred accordingly. This recusal system is necessary for the environment, sufficient to strengthen the spirit of judicial independence, and is a major innovation in judicial administration.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] The authorities have decided to appropriately reduce the salaries of civil servants in state-owned enterprises and agencies.

### Editorial: Don't Let Yourself Be Eaten or Kidnapped!

Mr. Chen Guofu, a member of the Central Committee, came to Shanghai a few days ago and exclaimed loudly at a welcome gathering of the Central Political School alumni: "Shanghai is too dangerous! You must be careful not to be eaten or kidnapped!" This statement is truly an emergency warning to many Shanghainese and deserves the vigilance and precaution of each of us.

Although Shanghai on the surface has no jackals, wolves, tigers, or leopards, the things that devour people are, upon careful consideration, far too numerous. Dance halls, bars, secret gambling dens, brothels, and disguised traps masquerading as entertainment – all of which advocate theft and lewdness – are all man-eating beasts. When wild animals rush down from the mountains to eat people, people know how to resist them and how to protect themselves. But when a person is eaten by the gambling and licentious beasts of Shanghai, they willingly send themselves into their mouths, without any resistance or fear. From every afternoon onwards, countless brothels, gambling dens, and dance halls in Shanghai open their blood-soaked mouths at every corner, ready to seize people and devour them. And every day, countless people are eaten until their skin and bones are gone, and they remain unenlightened until death.

The most dangerous are those who have just come from the inland. Eight years of cruel enemy blockade have brought their daily lives to an indescribably difficult situation. Once they run to the dazzling and colorful Shanghai, and are also intoxicated by victory, it is inevitable that some of those with superficial cultivation will have their minds completely collapse. Gleaming gold, towering Western-style buildings, cars speeding by, beautiful women, stacks of American dollars, and jewelry like jade and diamonds – all open their huge mouths, waiting to devour them. In the ten months since the Japanese surrendered last August, overtly or covertly, those who have been eaten by gold, Western-style houses, cars, women, American dollars, diamonds, etc., are truly countless. Recently, even white rice has jumped up to eat people; the sensational grain loan corruption case is a prominent example.

Shanghai is truly a man-eating Shanghai. Mr. Chen Guofu's warning deserves our attention.

Originally, Shanghai was also a place with quite a few kidnappers. If parents are not careful, their children will be kidnapped. Although Shanghai has not yet heard of "flower snatchers" like in Beiping, there are even more cases of girls being kidnapped by bandits and sold into brothels or seduced and corrupted. Citizens who have lived in Shanghai for a long time are most familiar with this, and the recent incident of several female students being lured to other places was once regarded as a strange tale.

The difference is that Shanghai's kidnappers are now not only kidnapping children but also adults. They not only want to kidnap people's bodies, but also their souls. The kidnapped person, although their body is still at home or at school, and from the outside appears to have free actions and an independent life, in reality, their soul and thoughts have long been kidnapped without their knowledge. Chen Yuansheng was originally a very ordinary bank clerk; why did he steal so much gold and American dollars and flee? And why did several old Shanghai merchants get mixed up with those who claimed to be people's representatives and rush to Nanjing to join in the fun? This clearly shows that their souls had been kidnapped without their knowledge, and therefore their actions could not help but obey the orders of those who kidnapped them.

As discussed above, Shanghai is certainly extremely prosperous in material terms, and extremely capable of providing people with beautiful and satisfying enjoyment, but at the same time it is also extremely dangerous and the easiest place to fall. In spiritual terms, Shanghai, while easily inspiring people due to external stimuli, is also a place where various claims are novel and unconventional, and can easily dazzle people's eyes and confuse their minds, leading to reckless behavior.

Therefore, we hope that Shanghainese will study Lao Tzu's detachment and Confucius's steadfastness in poverty in terms of material enjoyment. These are indeed clichés of China for thousands of years, and may not be sufficient to match today's world, but if we have this kind of cultivation, at least it can prevent us from snatching Western-style houses and cars, and from wanting gold and American dollars. We treat everything that others consider remarkable as worn-out shoes and dung. Is this pedantic? Is this foolish? Absolutely not. When others' misdeeds are exposed, they are imprisoned, interrogated in court, and in an instant, their reputation is ruined and their lives are uncertain, we still enjoy complete self-satisfaction. That is definitely not something that clever people who are seduced, eaten, and kidnapped by material things can compare with.

At the same time, we also hope that Shanghainese will be in good spirits. Even though they often interact with foreign friends, they should know that China still has our traditional essence in the principles of cultivating oneself, managing one's family, governing the country, and bringing peace to the world, and there is no need to abandon what is near and seek what is far, causing unnecessary confusion. Frankly speaking, in the post-war world, the democracy of Britain and the United States and the socialism of the Soviet Union must gradually converge and move towards harmony, and then world peace can be guaranteed. The British Labour Party is trying to walk this path. We should be glad that our Three Principles of the People, when truly implemented, will open up this path. In politics, we must use the Principle of Democracy to extract the strengths of Anglo-American democratic politics, and in economics, we must use the Principle of People's Livelihood to harvest the fruits of Soviet socialism. In other words, we must no longer adopt the dictatorial politics of the Soviet Union's one-party rule, nor can we follow in the footsteps of the old capitalist economic system of Britain and the United States. If we can steadfastly adhere to this belief in spirit, we will naturally not be kidnapped to be the followers of capitalism or the sacrificial offerings of communist dictatorship by echoing the views of others.

Life is like a white colt flashing past a crevice; wealth and glory are all like a dream. Let us all take advantage of the moment while we still have breath to do our best for the interests of the country and the nation. Do not follow the crowd, seek novelty, or indulge in eccentricity, leading to the dissipation of our souls and the alteration of our will, and finally be eaten and kidnapped by invisible beasts and kidnappers.

### Internationalization of the Port of Trieste: U.S. and Soviet Union Expected to Reach Compromise, Representatives of the Two Countries to Hold Extracurricular Meetings, Four Foreign Ministers Reject Amendment to the Italian-Austrian Border Request

[Our Newspaper News] London, 25th (Radio): The Four Foreign Ministers held a meeting today to discuss points on which they could not agree. At the same time, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov suddenly and voluntarily visited Byrnes, and therefore, hope for the Paris Peace Conference has been renewed. It is rumored that the U.S. and Soviet Union may reach a compromise, with the compromise being the internationalization of the Port of Trieste for a period of ten years.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 24th (United Press Telegram)] Byrnes and Molotov held a surprise one-hour meeting today. Diplomats believe that Molotov may have received instructions from Moscow regarding the most difficult Trieste issue between the four countries. During today afternoon's meeting, Molotov, adopting a diplomatic sit-down strike posture, refused to agree to any suggestions regarding the Italian treaty, and representatives of various countries then turned to discuss treaties with the Nazi vassal states in the Balkans. Some commentators believe that Molotov's lack of consideration for the Franco-Italian border and the disposition of the Italian Navy is because he does not want to reach any agreement on these issues before the Trieste port issue is resolved.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 24th] The Foreign Ministers' meeting was held twice today, in the morning and afternoon, to discuss four issues for a long time, namely: (1) the border between Italy and Austria, (2) the border between France and Italy, (3) the method of distributing the Italian fleet, (4) freedom of navigation on the Danube, (5) the most thorny issue of the affiliation of the Port of Trieste. Although the atmosphere at the meeting was extremely friendly, no substantive agreement was reached on any of these issues. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes met alone this afternoon to discuss the fourth issue; the details are unknown. Regarding the Austrian-Italian border issue, Austria's requests to Italy involved a major revision of the border, not a minor issue, and have been rejected by the four Foreign Ministers. Regarding railway traffic between the Austrian cities of Innsbruck and Linz, the four Foreign Ministers believe that guarantees should be given to facilitate it, and the matter has been referred to a committee of experts for discussion. Regarding the Franco-Italian border issue, France made five demands on Italy, and the Foreign Ministers' meeting has accepted four of them: (1) the Saint Bernard Pass, (2) the Mont Cenis Pass, (3) the Mont Thabor and Chaberton area, (4) the valleys of the Tinee and Vesubie rivers; all the above-mentioned areas have been ceded to France. Regarding the distribution of the Italian fleet, French experts have proposed a compromise plan for the ratio of Italian warships to be retained. The Soviet Foreign Minister immediately expressed his agreement, and an agreement could have been reached in principle. However, the U.S. and Britain refused to agree to the annexes proposed by Molotov, and an agreement could not be reached, but the door to amendments remains open. Regarding the issue of freedom of navigation on the Danube, although the four Foreign Ministers agreed in principle, the Soviet Foreign Minister also argued that all proposals on this matter should be submitted for discussion by the countries along the Danube, while the U.S. and Britain insisted on their original proposal, demanding that the matter be included in the peace treaty with Romania.

### Security Council Discusses the Spanish Question, Polish Proposal Rejected, Three-Member Committee Formed to Draft Appropriate Report

[Associated Press, New York, 24th] The United Nations Security Council today rejected, by a vote of seven to four, Poland's motion demanding the immediate severance of diplomatic relations with the Franco government of Spain. This motion was proposed by the Polish representative, Lange, on April 19th. (1) At today's vote, the representatives of the Soviet Union, France, and Mexico raised their hands in favor. Chinese representative Guo Taiqi first expressed his opposition. As one of the five major powers, China has the power of veto, so China alone was sufficient to overturn the motion. However, Guo did not declare that he was exercising the veto power. The other countries seconding the opposition were the U.S., Britain, Australia, Canada, and Brazil. After the vote, the Polish representative re-proposed that the issue remain on the Security Council's agenda so that it could be re-discussed before the United Nations General Assembly meets on September 1st. The meeting then decided that a three-member committee composed of representatives from Australia, Poland, and Britain would draft an appropriate report on the Spanish question. Before discussing the Spanish question today, the Security Council passed a new rule allowing the President of the Council to temporarily step down from the presidency when considering issues related to the country he represents.

### "China's Destiny" Sells Well in Japan

[Kozosha, Tokyo, 25th] The Japanese cultural community had heard of President Chiang's book "China's Destiny" during the War of Resistance, but it was impossible to obtain it due to the strict blockade policy of the warlords. On the 23rd of this month, the Shanghai Kozosha Daily News sent a special plane to transport a large number of books and publications, including 10,000 copies of "China's Destiny" and "President Chiang's Speeches to Japan," which were snapped up by bookstores.

### Atomic Energy Control: Australian Representative Evatt Proposes Compromise, Proposes the Establishment of an Administrative Committee to Reconcile U.S. and Soviet Differences

[Associated Press, New York, 25th] The Australian representative to the United Nations Atomic Energy Control Committee today proposed a suggestion, advocating the establishment of an administrative committee to draft an atomic energy control plan, and to reconcile, to the extent possible, the differing views in the plans proposed by the U.S. and Soviet Union. The U.S. plan advocates first establishing the highest control agency, which will eventually evolve into an international atomic management agency, as proposed by Baruch. The Australian representative's suggestion seems to endorse this, but opposes the Soviet Union's plan to establish two separate committees, one to exchange scientific information on atomic development among the United Nations, and the other to be solely responsible for atomic energy control. The suggestion was revealed by Australian Foreign Minister Evatt, who is also the chairman of the United Nations Atomic Energy Committee, and the committee is scheduled to hold its third meeting at 9:00 p.m. today.

### Britain Attempts to Break the Stalemate, Proposes Long-Term Plan, Suggests Organizing a Provisional Government, Indian National Congress Resolutely Rejects

[Our Newspaper News] London, 25th (Radio): The British delegation's work in India has completely failed, and it is scheduled to issue a statement tomorrow and leave India to return to the delegation in two or three days. Jinnah, the leader of the Muslim League, met with the Viceroy of India and the British delegation today; the content is unknown.

[Reuters, New Delhi, 24th] The Executive Committee of the National Congress presented a brief letter to the Viceroy of India, Wavell, this afternoon, stating that it rejected the suggestion of establishing a provisional government. The detailed reasons will be presented tomorrow. There is no hope that this stalemate cannot be broken, because if the National Congress can accept the British Cabinet's long-term plan, the issue of establishing a provisional government may as well be discussed again from the beginning. Nehru, the President of the National Congress, met with Cripps today to discuss issues related to the long-term plan. Gandhi is also scheduled to meet with the Cabinet delegation tonight. The Executive Committee of the National Congress will meet again on Thursday, at which time a decision may be made on the British side's long-term plan. The Muslim League has previously expressed its acceptance of the British side's long-term plan. Today, the Executive Committee of the League held another 90-minute meeting to discuss the issue of the provisional government, but no decision has yet been made. In addition, the orthodox Hindu organization Mahasabha will also meet to discuss the steps to be taken after the National Congress announces its decision.

[Reuters, New Delhi, 24th] It is generally believed that the National Congress is unwilling to immediately accept the long-term plan proposed by the British representatives because the government of Bengal issued a circular announcing the procedures for submitting candidates. The National Congress believes that this move is intended to make the candidates accept the provincial division system. The British Cabinet Ministers are explaining this matter.

[Reuters, New Delhi, 25th] Political observers here predict that the British delegation will issue a formal communique today, which may announce the decision to reconsider the plan for the Indian provisional government.

[United Press, Bikini Island, USS McKinley, 25th] A bulletin from the flagship of General Blandy, commander of the atomic bomb test, stated: Last night's exercise was completely successful. When the atomic bomb was dropped during the exercise, it emitted a huge spark and hit the target. The issue of many disasters caused by debris during the exercise is still under study. Among the 42,000 test personnel, there is much discussion about other disasters that will occur.

[Associated Press, En Route to Bikini Island, 24th] The U.S. Navy will encounter an unusually "safety first" task in the Bikini atomic bomb test.

In addition, more than 100 aircraft will circle overhead, reaching the stratosphere, to observe the clouds rising from the atomic bomb explosion. Drinking water will also be subjected to a safety-first operation to eliminate radiation, which is unprecedented in world history. Drinking water on board is normally distilled from seawater. To prevent it from containing radiation. The crew members are most afraid of the X-rays emitted by the flash of the atomic bomb. In fact, this is a misunderstanding, and the Navy has taken various precautions to ensure that all personnel are not exposed to even a trace of X-rays. It is said that anyone within two miles of the flash of the atomic bomb will temporarily lose fertility. Many Japanese men in Hiroshima lost their fertility as a result.

### Far East International Military Tribunal: New Stage of Witness Testimony Yesterday; Defendant Hata Shunroku's American Defense Attorney Files a Petition; Webb States Direct Speech is an Australian Trait

[Reconstruction Society Tokyo, 25th] The International Tribunal's trial proceedings, from the 17th until yesterday, were all about the recruitment of witnesses related to military specialized education and propaganda in preparation for war, with a review of evidence. A total of two American witnesses and eighty-one Japanese witnesses were summoned. Yesterday, the final summons was for former Police Bureau Chief Koizumi Gorō, marking the end of the first stage of witness questioning. Starting today, the proceedings will move on to examine the core of war preparations: political instability, the military's pressure on the government, and the national reform movement. The events to be examined include the collapse of the Tanaka Giichi Cabinet, the abortion of the Ugaki Kazushige Cabinet, and the downfall of the Yonai Mitsumasa and the third Konoe Fumimaro Cabinets. Furthermore, the Hamaguchi Osachi assassination attempt, which was the main cause of such political unrest, the long-unreleased March Incident, the Blood Pledge Corps Incident, the May 15 Incident, the February 26 Incident, and the establishment of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association will also be addressed. It is expected that political giants such as Yonai, Wakatsuki, Ugaki, and Marquis Tokugawa Yoshichika will all be summoned to testify.

[United Press Tokyo, 25th] The International Tribunal continued its hearing today. The defense attorney for defendant Hata Shunroku, former Commander-in-Chief of the China Expeditionary Army, Mr. Lazardus, submitted a petition stating that some of the charges in the indictment against his client were cases of mistaken identity. He requested that retired Lieutenant General Hata Hiko be summoned to court for cross-examination to prove that it was the Lieutenant General involved in the Manchurian Incident, not the defendant Hata Shunroku with the same surname. Lazardus stated: Lieutenant General Hata Hiko was the Chief of Staff of the Japanese Kwantung Army when the Soviet Union entered the war, and his whereabouts have been unknown since then. Therefore, to investigate the crimes of "Hata so-and-so" mentioned in the indictment, this person must be summoned for cross-examination. In 1938, Hata Shunroku served as the Commander-in-Chief of the Central China Expeditionary Army, and the following year he served as the Lord Chamberlain to the Emperor. In August 1939, he served as the Minister of the Army and the Director-General of the Manchurian Affairs Bureau. His final position was as the commander of the Second Army Group. When the court convened today, Judge Webb drew attention to an analysis of the trial situation published in the Japan Times today by United Press. Webb said: "The article mentions that I speak the most, but you must note that I am the only judge with a microphone. There are ten other competent judges present who are giving me the greatest assistance. The article states that I spoke rudely to the defendants. Generally, I speak directly, which may be mistaken for rudeness. As I am Australian, direct speech is a characteristic of my country."

### Shidehara's Testimony: Favorable to Shigemitsu Mamoru

He was unwilling to include Minami Jirō in the military clique, [this] military clique could not be controlled by Minami Jirō's Ministry of the Army at that time. Shidehara stated: During his tenure as Foreign Minister, the Japanese Cabinet did not have any intention of territorial expansion. The "Manchurian Incident" was also not the policy of the regular government. The cabinet at that time was forced to resign due to the occurrence of the "Manchurian Incident." Shigemitsu Mamoru was the Minister to Nanjing at the time and was ordered to implement his pro-China goodwill and peace policy. "I greatly trust Shigemitsu Mamoru and am very satisfied with his implementation of my China policy." The usually dull meeting suddenly became lively this afternoon, as today's testimony gradually became more attention-grabbing. The defendants, who usually listened to the reports with an indifferent attitude, suddenly became tense and attentive this afternoon. Minami Jirō, who was most related to this afternoon's trial, appeared indifferent due to hearing loss. Shidehara, who is 68 years old, suddenly appeared absent-minded in the calm atmosphere of this afternoon's meeting. When this elderly baron said, "I was born in 1972," the entire court, including all the defendants, burst into laughter.

[Our Newspaper Report] After the abduction of flour and cotton tycoon Rong Desheng, all parties are still paying close attention to the case. Unexpectedly, at 3:30 AM yesterday morning, the Shanghai Inspection Office of the Garrison Headquarters suddenly received a secret report stating that the bandits in the case were hiding in the residence of Chen Tongsheng, an architect, at No. 4, Lane 440, Rue Raoul-Doën.

### Eighty-Four Houses Left by German Nationals: Already Distributed; Some Allottees Still Unable to Move In; Strict Prevention of Further Illegal Occupation

[Our Newspaper Report] The Housing Allocation Committee for Shanghai Agencies under the Executive Yuan held a meeting yesterday afternoon and resolved that the work of the committee's investigation team could be concluded by the end of the month, and it was planned to lay off 30 people. Future work will focus entirely on statistics and allocation. Furthermore, a portion of Japanese nationals will soon be repatriated. To prevent illegal occupation of abandoned houses, the committee notified the Japanese Nationals Management Committee to submit a list within one week to the committee. The houses will be pre-allocated to approved agencies before the Japanese nationals are evacuated. Once the Japanese nationals leave the houses, the agencies will be allowed to take possession. Furthermore, the committee has found it difficult to allocate German national houses. Recently, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs replied that some German nationals will continue to reside in Shanghai, resulting in some agencies receiving allocation notices and finding that the houses were still occupied when they went to inspect them, making it impossible to move in. The Housing Committee will discuss a solution separately. Currently, the German national houses that have been allocated include those to the Jiangsu Provincial Supervisory Commissioner's Office, the High Court, the High Court Prosecutor's Office, the District Court, the District Court Prosecutor's Office, the U.S. Consulate, the U.S. Naval Office in Shanghai, "UNRRA," the Canadian Consulate, American engineers from the Executive Yuan's Engineering Planning Group, and American shipbuilding experts from the Jiangnan Shipyard, totaling eighty-four houses. The German national furniture will be temporarily kept by the personnel of the agencies taking possession, and will be sold later. The committee stipulates that when the recipients go to take possession of the houses, they must check and count the furniture one by one according to the list provided by the German nationals and sign the list in quadruplicate. One copy will be given to the German nationals, one copy will be kept by the recipient, and the remaining two copies will be submitted to the German Nationals Management Committee for record. The recipient will be responsible for compensation if there are any shortages in the future. It is also heard that those who tear down the seals on sealed houses and illegally occupy them will have their supervisory agencies severely punished. Owners requesting to take back their houses for their own use are limited to one house. The unified allocation of Japanese national houses, totaling fifty houses, will be held next Wednesday.

### Land Sales Tax: Measures to be Changed

[Our Newspaper Report] The sluggish land transaction in this city is mainly due to the excessively high land sales tax rate (50% must be levied).

The government has expressed that it intends to abolish this tax rule soon. In the future, land price tax and land value increment tax will be levied progressively according to the Land Law and according to the change of currency value to seek reasonableness. Furthermore, in order to sympathize with residents who have no houses to live in, the city government allows citizens to request the use of public land to build factories or residences. However, in order to prevent the use of land for profit, strict measures will be formulated to show restrictions. The Land Administration Bureau is currently actively handling land registration, starting with the six districts of Huangpu, Hunam, Caohua, Fahua, Yinxiang, and Zhabei. If no disputes arise two months after the application for registration, the bureau will issue a land ownership certificate.

### Xu Enzeng's Thirty-Year Plan: Founding the Jianguo Machinery Agricultural Reclamation Company; Promoting Agricultural Industrialization

[Our Newspaper Report] Xu Enzeng, the former director of the Central Investigation and Statistics Bureau, has been residing in Shanghai since leaving political life, resuming his position in the industrial sector from sixteen years ago. He has raised funds to establish the Jianguo Machinery Agricultural Reclamation Company, which has been going on for several months. When the reporter visited him the other day, Mr. Xu passionately discussed the issue of agricultural industrialization in China. He said: "The future agricultural industrialization of China is an inevitable trend and an inevitable development to adapt to the trends of the times. The reconstruction of rural areas after the war depends on the organization of scientific methods, and the demand for manpower in the future reconstruction cause is extremely urgent. The efficiency of mechanical cultivation compared to manual cultivation is at least a ratio of one hundred to one. The surplus manpower can be used to develop other reconstruction causes. However, the general level of knowledge of farmers in our country is low, and to achieve agricultural industrialization, we must go through a considerable process."

The establishment of the Jianguo Machinery Agricultural Reclamation Company aims to assist the government in promoting agricultural industrialization. As for the promotion methods: (1) Mechanization: Adopt gradual promotion and use machinery to replace manual cultivation. (2) Collective Management: In adjacent rural areas, jointly use a machine for cultivation, so that poor farmers have the opportunity to use machinery. The initial targets for promotion are the Taihu Lake Basin, the Dongting Lake Basin, and the Subei area, with Subei as the main focus. It is also planned to select a certain place near Shanghai as an experimental demonstration area. In terms of machinery, from plowing to harvesting, including five different machines as a set, the value of each set of machinery is currently about US$5,000. It is estimated that five sets of machinery can cultivate 10,000 acres of land. Taking Subei as an example, the cultivable land is about 10 million acres, which requires more than 5,000 sets of machinery. Judging from the current situation, the economic strength of the general rural areas of our country and the ordering of huge amounts of machinery are difficult. Therefore, the completion of agricultural industrialization in China will require at least five years or even ten years. Mr. Xu stated: "He intends to devote the next thirty years to the work of agricultural industrialization."

### Small Denomination Legal Tender: Must Not Be Rejected

### Bei Zuyi Returns from North China: Discussing the Economic Situation

The Reconstruction of North China Possesses Superior Conditions: Its Fur and Cotton Production are Comparable to the World

[Our Newspaper's Report] Bei Zuyi, Governor of the Central Bank, having just returned from an inspection of North China on the 23rd, met with members of the city's press at the Central Bank at 10 o'clock yesterday morning. According to what was discussed, the impression from this trip was quite good. However, the revitalization of North China's economy and finance, as well as domestic and foreign trade, truly depends on the early restoration of transportation. He stated: North China is one of the economic and financial centers of the country. During the period when the enemy and puppets occupied it, control was especially strict. Although there was some impact on the financial aspects, the material impact was still less. Therefore, generally speaking, the economic situation in North China is actually more stable than in this city. For example, people's lives and market trends are both calmer than in this city. Wages are also lower than in this city, and the scale of agriculture and industry in all aspects has a foundation. Therefore, once the overall situation clears and transportation is restored, goods can flow freely, and North China will not be difficult to become the starting point for our country's economic recovery. Bei then cited the fur specialty of Baotou in North China as an example. According to reports, due to the lack of transportation, the value of the stockpiled inventory of this specialty is over US$10 million. If this specialty can be exported steadily, it will not be difficult to compete in the world market. As for the production of cotton in North China, it is not only sufficient for domestic use but also has a surplus for export, as was the case before the war. Therefore, if transportation is restored, the supply of domestic materials can be smoothed, and agricultural products from various places can also be exported steadily. Bei also earnestly expressed his determination to assist in export trade. Reporters then inquired about opinions on improving the current foreign exchange policy. Bei replied that the Central Bank implements all financial measures in accordance with the established policies of the authorities, so it is inconvenient to comment on the various opinions expressed to the outside world. It is heard that Bei, together with Consultant Yang Ge, Lu Dingzhong, Chen Guangfu, and others, took the night train to Beijing last night to make requests to the authorities.

### After Three Interrogations by the District Procuratorate, Two Grain Officials Are Detained by the Garrison Command

Wang and Ren Thank the Detention Center for Its Hospitality; The Military Law Office Sends a Letter to the Ministry of Food to Investigate the Truth

The Peier team was well-coordinated and easily defeated Huaqiao 50-32 to win the Group B Basketball Championship.

Referee Yang Liecheng blew the whistle to start the game. Huaqiao took the first offensive, and Shen Xianxiong scored first, leading 2-0. Before long, Peier's He Zengli returned the color. After both sides were tied 2-2, Huaqiao showed signs of exhaustion. Peier pressed forward step by step. Peier's He Zeng, near probing and long-range shooting, was invincible.

### Zhejiang's Finances Have Not Improved; Schooling Will Still Face Difficulties

Mr. Shen Honglie Tells Reporters After Inspecting Schools in Hangzhou

[Our Hangzhou Special Dispatch] Shen Honglie, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, accompanied by education personnel, visited five private middle schools in Hangzhou on the afternoon of the 24th: Qinghua, Zhengze, Zhongshan, Hongdao, and Huiyu, successively. He inquired in detail about the funding, equipment, teacher salaries, and student meals of each school. After the inspection was completed at 5 pm, he told reporters: "The secondary schools in Hangzhou are significantly better than the situation in the counties inspected previously. In terms of school buildings, the Hangzhou Normal School is the most complete among the provincial schools. The rest are incomplete and dilapidated. Private middle schools such as Hongdao, Donglan, and Huixing are complete and adequate. However, all schools lack equipment. Regarding teacher salaries, we should strive to make them equal to those of civil servants, and private schools should also do the same. Since the Anti-Japanese War, education personnel have lived frugally but have still been able to uphold their positions, which is commendable. This year, the educational funding allocated is very little, and the post-war recovery funds for each school are actually insufficient. Furthermore, since the financial system reform on July 1st, the provincial finances have not improved slightly. Therefore, school operators will still face numerous difficulties. This situation will require two or three years of arduous support before any improvement can be seen." He also scheduled a discussion meeting with the principals and teachers of public and private schools in Hangzhou on the afternoon of the 25th and scheduled a lecture for students on the afternoon of the 26th. He will inspect hospitals throughout the city on the 27th. (Butterfly)

### Appealing for Victims of Disasters in Central Hunan and Northern Jiangsu: Star East Faces Qingbai Team Again

Today at 5:30 PM at the Lyceum; Related to Charity, Hope for Enthusiastic Ticket Purchases

The disaster situation in Central Hunan and Northern Jiangsu is severe. Du Yuesheng, Wu Kaixian, Zhang Shizhao, Fan Shaozeng, and Gu Jiasang of this city have specially initiated a charity football match to raise relief funds. Taking advantage of the Hong Kong Star East Football Team's presence in Shanghai, they invited the team to face off against the city champion Qingbai Team again at the Lyceum. The match will begin at 5:30 PM. Star East previously lost 1-3 to Qingbai, and today is a good opportunity for revenge, so they will undoubtedly do their best to compete. Qingbai, in order to maintain their reputation, will also seek victory again.

Military Police and Constabulary All Mobilized

In order to show the importance of today's match, the initiator Du Yuesheng will personally perform the opening kickoff ceremony. The referee is Zhang Le, and the linesmen are Deng Xiaoliang and Huang Renyi. Tickets for the grandstand are divided into two types: 5,000 and 10,000 yuan. Special 20,000 yuan seats will be set up in the stadium. Long-term complimentary tickets issued by the Football Committee will be temporarily suspended. Sports journalists will be admitted with tickets, and military police will also need to purchase tickets. In order to maintain order in the stadium, the Garrison Command, the Military Police Corps, and the Municipal Police Department have been specially requested to dispatch a large number of military police to maintain strict security around the Lyceum and will absolutely not allow anyone to enter without a ticket. In addition to the Fuxing Middle Road gate, the Shaanxi South Road gate will also be opened at the entrance to the stadium. This is related to charity, and it is hoped that everyone will purchase tickets to save compatriots in need.

The lineups for Star East and Qingbai were announced yesterday by the responsible persons of each team and are recorded below:

Star East

Zhu Zhaoheng

Huo Yaohua, Hou Rongsheng

Luo Weiquan, Xu Jingcheng, Feng Kunsheng

Li Shuoyou, Liu Songsheng, Guo Yingqi, Zhang Jinhai, Deng Guangsen

(Reinforcements) Li Zhaorong, Feng Jingxiang

Qingbai

Qin Bigao

Yan Shixin, Wu Qixiang

Qu Yongfu, Meng Yiliang, Gao Baozheng

Cao Qiuting, Luo Shoufu, Li Yichen, Xu Wenkui, Fei Chunhua

(Reinforcements) Huang Shijie, Yi Che

Star East Team Adjusts Lineup

The Star East guest team's roster was personally adjusted and announced by team leader Hu. There is no change in the goalkeeper. The heavy responsibility of defense is entrusted to Huo and Hou. Captain Xu is stationed in the center, supplemented by Luo and Feng as midfielders, which is quite appropriate. The mystery players of the forward line, Li Zhaorong and Feng Jingxiang, are listed as reinforcements. If the situation changes, they may still play. Guo Yingqi showed his edge in the previous match against Hualian, and today he will still play as the center forward, paired with Liu Songsheng, Zhang Jinhai, Li Shuoyou, and Deng Guangsen, which is naturally tacit. Overall, today's formation is stronger in defense than offense.

Qingbai Team Well-Matched

Qingbai is the champion of this Shanghai football tournament and has an extraordinary demeanor. Moreover, last week, they defeated Star East 3-1. Their exquisite individual techniques and close teamwork are unmatched in Shanghai. Qin Bigao is in excellent condition recently. Yan and Wu are a pair of iron gates. Meng Yiliang and Afu Baozheng guard the central defense fortress, making it difficult for enemy cavalry to enter. Forward Gu Yiche has a short rest, and Luo Shoufu fills the left inner forward position. A Kui moves to the left. There are no other changes, and the strength will not be weakened. Therefore, when the two armies meet again today, there will surely be many tense and exciting moments.

### Current Status of Educational Administrative Work

— Zhu Jiahua

Since the victory, the work of the Ministry of Education has mostly been focused on restoration and post-war recovery. Based on the resolutions of the National Teachers' Restoration and Post-War Conference held in Chongqing last September, the Ministry of Education must quickly redistribute the schools and cultural institutions that moved west reasonably. It must revitalize the schools in the recovered areas, eradicate enslaved education, and seek to provide every young student with a place to study. These tasks are naturally extremely difficult, and the problems are numerous.

(1) Student Enrollment Issues: In the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, education has made much progress in terms of its scale of development, and the number of students has greatly increased. Before the war, there were over 41,000 students in colleges and universities; now, the number has almost doubled. Before the war, there were over 620,000 middle school students; now, there are over 1,160,000, not including students in the recovered areas. Before the war, there were 18 million elementary school students; now, there are 25 million in the 19 provinces and cities in the rear alone. The number of students will inevitably increase greatly in the future. As we universally promote national education and as local autonomy progresses, elementary and middle schools will develop further daily. Just taking colleges and universities as an example, since the victory, we have established six temporary university refresher courses in the Northeast, accommodating over 13,000 students from colleges and universities during the enemy-puppet period. After the summer vacation, they will enter formal schools separately. The Youth Army was originally composed of students from colleges and universities and senior high school students. After being discharged from the military, they must return to school, numbering over ten thousand. The number of students admitted to various colleges and universities during the summer vacation is also estimated to be around ten thousand. In total, there will be at least tens of thousands of new college and university students this year. With the nearly 80,000 existing students, schools are already overcrowded. With the addition of tens of thousands more students, and high prices limiting school equipment, the difficulties can be imagined. The Ministry of Education and educational figures are making every effort to overcome these difficulties.

(2) Teacher Issues: At a time when the number of students is increasing rapidly, there is an even greater shortage of teachers. Among the 660,000 elementary school teachers in the 19 provinces and cities in the rear, only 40% have received teacher training or are certified. The proportion of qualified middle school teachers is also less than half. Although there are many people seeking teaching positions in cities, this is only a temporary and abnormal phenomenon. In the vast countryside or remote provinces, there is a great shortage of teachers. Because of this, we hold teacher training campaigns every year, and recently, we planned to increase the number of teacher training students by 500,000 in five years, in order to alleviate the shortage of teachers in elementary education. We have also changed the structure of university teacher training colleges. All students in liberal arts, science, engineering, and agriculture colleges who aspire to engage in education for life can register at the teacher training college, receive professional teacher training, and receive the same treatment as teacher training students, in order to increase the number of middle school teachers. As for the training of university teachers, it involves specialized knowledge and advanced research, which cannot be achieved overnight. One of the reasons we are not rashly adding many universities at the moment is the difficulty in finding teachers. We have only restored Beiyang University, Shandong University, and Anhui University, and created Lanzhou University. This year, we only plan to establish a foreign language specialty school to meet the demand for international workers, which the Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly supports.

Because of the shortage of teachers in universities and colleges, the Ministry of Education encourages students who have completed their studies abroad to return to the country, providing them with living assistance and travel subsidies, hoping that they will return as soon as possible to serve domestic education.

The meager salaries of teachers are also one of the reasons for the reduction in the number of teachers. Naturally, it is difficult to raise the salaries of education personnel alone, but we are doing our best to pay attention to the welfare of teachers. In addition to their salaries, university professors receive 25,000 yuan in academic research funds per person. We are now planning to find a way to double this amount and have submitted a special request to the Executive Yuan, hoping to be approved. The salaries of middle school teachers vary from province to province. The Ministry of Education stipulates that the highest monthly salary for senior high school teachers is 300 yuan (basic salary), and the monthly salary for junior high school teachers is 220 yuan. All other allowances are paid according to local standards. This standard is higher than before the war. The salaries of elementary school teachers vary even more from place to place. The Ministry of Education stipulates that the standard should be three times the cost of personal clothing, food, and housing in the local area, hoping that all localities can do this in good faith. In summary, the fact that teacher salaries are insufficient to maintain a livelihood is the most troubling issue. In the past, many teachers have switched careers as a result. We must find a way to prevent this phenomenon from continuing and allow teachers to teach in peace.

(3) Studying Abroad Issues: Whether for training teachers or meeting the needs of national construction, studying abroad must continue. Moreover, the international changes since the war have been great, and academic progress has been astonishing. We must further understand Europe and the United States. It is essential for young students to go abroad for further study. Therefore, the study abroad plan should be improved, and the study abroad policy must continue. The number of students taking the public-funded study abroad examination this year is not large. There are only 120 government-funded students. In addition, there are 70 exchange students between France and China, and public-funded students from the Sino-British Education Fund Board. Study abroad majors are being prepared for the study abroad examination. The examination is currently underway for registration. The examination will also be opened soon. The education funding is far from meeting the actual needs. The central government has allocated 60 billion yuan for education restoration, which is not a small amount. However, when divided among several hundred units, the amount each unit receives is still insufficient. For example, Central University had 1,200 students before the war. Now it has nearly 5,000. The school buildings are greatly insufficient, and the original school buildings are dilapidated and need to be repaired. School equipment must be increased. This expense is considerable. Zhejiang University had less than 800 students before the war. Now it has more than 2,000, and the school buildings are not only insufficient, but three-fifths of them were destroyed. The buildings of Tsinghua University and Nankai University were heavily damaged. The situation in other schools is roughly the same. Using the restoration funds set in September of last year, including transportation, repairs, and Sichuan travel expenses, with prices having risen so much, it is even more insufficient. For the education restoration funds for the recovered provinces and cities, 1.225 billion yuan of emergency measures funds allocated by the Executive Yuan were distributed last year. This year, it has been approved to allocate 6.6 billion yuan from the provincial restoration funds for education restoration. Some provinces received 1.1 to 1.2 billion yuan, while others received 300 to 400 million yuan. It is really not enough to restore the schools and educational institutions destroyed by the enemy with this funding. The Ministry of Education once required all provinces and cities to fully restore education within one year after the enemy's surrender, but due to financial difficulties, it is feared that the expected progress will be difficult to achieve.

The Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has promised to supplement the needs of agricultural, industrial, and medical departments with US$4 million, and is in talks to purchase them. The one million US dollar worth of books and equipment ordered by the Ministry of Education during the war, and the 200,000 to 300,000 volumes of books and periodicals donated by the Ministry of Education in England and the United States recently, are now beginning to arrive one after another. The science instrument manufacturing plants established by various provinces to manufacture science instruments for middle schools will also be given appropriate subsidies this year to increase their output. The most common and urgent need is the equipment of school classroom desks and chairs and student beds. In some provinces, schools have been in session for almost a year, and even desks, chairs, and bed boards are not complete. Students are standing in class and sleeping on the floor. This kind of practical situation, of course, affects the efficiency of education and must be remedied as soon as possible. The minimum equipment of schools must be completed in the shortest possible time.

In addition to the above four issues, the Ministry of Education is striving to solve and intensify its work. Regarding the improvement of the curriculum of various levels of schools, the Ministry of Education has long started to gather experts to discuss and prepare for revisions. School administration must be on track and strictly and carefully select principals. How to encourage private schooling is also being actively planned. In short, education is currently in need of many things. The revival of education is to improve the status quo while maintaining the status quo, and there is a lack of manpower, material resources, and intelligence. Please ask all comrades and colleagues in the education and cultural circles to offer valuable opinions to promote our century-old plan. (Report at the Central Memorial Week of the National Government on June 24, 1946)

In the afternoon, it slightly fell to 1.935 million. Overnight transactions were again hyped up to over 1.95 million, but transactions were still few. As a result, the closing price rose by 13,000 compared to the previous close. Ornaments were 10,600 yuan per gram. Refined silver did not change. Private interest rates ranged from 1.3 to 1.6 jiao. Miscellaneous banks had more demand, and interest rates were about 1.8 jiao.

The foreign exchange market for US dollars was stagnant and stable. The focus of the market in this port shifted back to Hong Kong (the Hong Kong newspaper Shen reported that the US dollar was 510 yuan, 4,9), which caused buying interest to be quiet. It rose slightly from around 2650 yuan in the early morning to around 2660 yuan, and remained at this price until the end. As a result, it was similar to the previous close. The Hong Kong dollar was initially flat and then stabilized. There were still transfers of funds to Hong Kong to absorb US dollars and US currency (calculated at an exchange rate of just under 2,500), which caused demand to exceed supply. As a result, it rose back by 8 yuan later. The Hong Kong exchange rate rose from 510 yuan to 530 yuan. The Indian exchange rate was 640 yuan. The British exchange rate was offered at 8,600 yuan, but there was no activity in the US exchange rate.

### Public Bonds in a Standstill; Bulls Unwilling to Let Go; Scattered Shorts Still Covering

Public bonds were still traded by insiders. Cheap miscellaneous bonds continued to be bought by hot money out of curiosity, and were squeezed again with the unified "C" bonds. Due to the unwillingness of the major bulls to let go, scattered shorts were still covering sporadically. "C" bonds were called up from 750 yuan to over 850 yuan, and then became quiet. Most of the disputes in the industry are still delayed, forming a stalemate. The noon closing result was still more stable than the previous day, and miscellaneous bonds made further progress.

### Yarn Prices Fall, Cotton Prices Rise

Yesterday, the yarn market had a particularly strong reaction. Buying interest from the South China group had reached saturation and stopped buying, causing Double Horse to plummet by 100,000. The morning opening price was still at 1.589 million, but with few buyers, the industry lowered prices to sell, and the price gradually decreased. The 16-count and 20-count yarns of other brands also fell by 10,000 to 20,000. People's hearts were not too empty, and they were quietly waiting for customer sales to develop. According to the situation, the rise was too rapid the previous day, and the interruption of transactions and subsequent fall yesterday seemed to be a natural phenomenon based on the surplus or deficiency of supply and demand.

Yesterday, New York's US cotton telegrams continued to rise by 13 to 18 points, calculated at US$29.62 for the near term, US$29.83 for the far term, and US$30.23 for the Midling spot. Spot cotton transactions in this port were even better. Dasheng, Jiafeng, Zhenxin, and Shenxin No. 1 Factory all made purchases. Inter-flower number trading was also not quiet. Market prices were firm and strong.

### Cotton Cloth Market Turns Positive, But White Cloth and Printed Cloth Decline

Grey cloth and drill were trending firm because demand from Sichuan, Tianjin, Guangdong, and other groups was still not weak. Because China Textile has not opened for ten days, the chips on the market are dry, and the momentum is even more positive. However, white cloth is gradually entering a declining path, and printed cloth sales are particularly sluggish. As a result, V-dragons and drills rose by 500 yuan to 1,000 yuan. At noon, China Textile Construction opened for sale of cloth, with a very large number of items. Grey cloth was 500 to 1,000 yuan higher than the previous time, and the rest was flat. Drill was still not supplied. The market situation rose another step in the afternoon.

### Rainproof Cloth Sales Sluggish

Yesterday, the price of ordinary double-sided rainproof cloth of various brands fell to 5,250 yuan per yard, and single-sided cloth sold for 4,250 yuan. Buyers' purchasing interest was still lazy, creating a situation of oversupply. Although it is related to the lack of rain in the recent period, it is also due to the abundance of products, the decline in quality, and the fact that it was initially raised too much. The Nanjing group's air force uniform sales are not good, which is its fatal blow.

### Company Reorganization Extended to the End of the Year

[Our Report] The measures for reorganizing companies in the recovered areas were originally scheduled to end at the end of this month. Therefore, all of these companies are actively rushing to complete the process, and are convening shareholder meetings this month to resolve everything. It is learned that the Ministry believes that the deadline is too urgent, and the number of companies that have not completed the process by the deadline is very large. It has internally decided to extend the deadline by six months to the end of this year, and an official order will be seen soon.

### Southeast Asia to Supply 330,000 Tons of World Rice in the Next Three Months

[United Press, Singapore, 24th] According to reports: In the months of July, August, and September, Southeast Asia is preparing to supply 330,000 tons of rice to the world to relieve the food shortage. In the months of April, May, and June, Southeast Asia had supplied 220,000 tons of rice to various parts of the world, 65,000 tons less than the previously expected amount.

### Slight Drop in Rayon

Yesterday in the rayon market, the Guang brand of No. 120 Heavenly Bridge opened at 1,840,000 yuan. It briefly rose to 1,860,000 yuan, then retreated to close at 1,820,000 yuan, the same as the previous day's price. Various miscellaneous brands were down by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Transactions in factory silk were quiet, with little fluctuation in quoted prices. Raw silk saw some activity yesterday, with prices ranging from 1,630,000 to 1,650,000 yuan. Fine silk fabrics such as Dacheng checkered crepe experienced a slight increase, reaching 5,150 yuan in the morning and rising by 100 yuan in the afternoon, slightly less than the 200 yuan increase of the previous day. Meiya quilt covers saw few transactions, with quoted prices around 1,510,000 to 1,520,000 yuan. Minsheng brocade satin saw 500 pieces transacted yesterday at a price of 24,000 yuan, but the factory still considered this below cost and was unwilling to sell more.

### Sugar Prices Firm

Yesterday, the sugar market was initially weak but later firmed, with little overall change. The guild's auction saw medium granulated sugar drop slightly by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan in the morning, initially set at 1,000,500 yuan to 1,000,450 yuan, then recovering to 1,000,600 yuan to 1,000,550 yuan, and rising to 1,000,900 yuan in the afternoon. Company warehouse receipts No. 22 sold for 1,000,600 yuan, and No. 20 for 1,000,500 to 1,000,450 yuan. Diaoging sold 70 packages at 920,000 yuan, Jianbing at 1,190,000 yuan, and branded Dianhua white sugar opened at 1,200,000 yuan. Xinghua red sugar was agreed upon at 1,000,550 yuan, totaling one hundred and several dozen baskets. No. 1 cotton white sugar was auctioned at 1,160,000 yuan, and raw sugar at 990,000 yuan.

The Taiwan Company's spot goods were still offered at 980,000 yuan, with over 2,000 packages allocated first. Goods en route were at 950,000 yuan. The allocation quota is expected to be decided today.

### Industrial Electrification

American Manufacturers to Assist China in Establishing Seven Power Plants

[United Press, New York, 24th] Ebasco Services Incorporated announced today that it has signed a contract with the Chinese Supply Commission to design, construct, and manage seven power plants in Shanghai and other parts of China as part of China's industrial electrification program. The company expects to sign similar contracts soon.

### Tea Market Transactions Quiet; No Transactions for New Qihong Tea Yet

The first batch of new Qimen black tea, shipped by Zhenhe Tea Shop, arrived some days ago. Although buyers have inquired, no agreement has been reached due to unresolved negotiations between the parties. As for other varieties, holders are unwilling to sell cheaply. However, shops and trading houses on this street are well-stocked and do not need to replenish. Therefore, the situation is unusually quiet. According to industry insiders, the interest in Taiwan black tea and Mao tea in the Wuxi and Yixing areas has the potential to rekindle. If this happens, the market atmosphere will become lively.

### Over 300 Bales of Huzhou Silk Shipped Directly to Marseille

Another 600 Bales Shipped to Bombay

[Our Report] The Harvey Maersk, managed by Jardine Matheson & Co., left Shanghai today for Hong Kong and Bombay, carrying over six hundred bales of Huzhou silk to Bombay. Also, the Jinghaigen is scheduled to depart for Europe today, carrying over three hundred bales of Huzhou silk to Marseille. This is the first batch of goods shipped directly to France this year.

### Speculative Capital Active in the Market Again; Chinese Stocks Continue to Rise; Foreign Stocks Still in a Consolidation Phase

After the rebound the day before, Chinese stocks saw a significant influx of speculative capital yesterday. Industry insiders were pleased, and stock prices rose considerably. Yong Yarns rose from 525 yuan to 558 yuan, Meiya from 3280 yuan to 3580 yuan, Jingfu from 2255 yuan to 258 yuan, Xinguang from 245 yuan to 280 yuan, Qin Xing had a low of 195 yuan and a high of 230 yuan. After reaching a high at noon, prices slightly retreated. Various small- and medium-sized unpopular stocks were scarce, showing progress. Blue-chip stocks also gradually recovered. As a result, popular large stocks continued to rise by about 70%, small stocks rose by 10%, unpopular small- and medium-sized stocks generally advanced by 10%, and blue-chip stocks stabilized.

Foreign stocks continued to trend upward, with buyers shifting their focus to undervalued stocks. Fluctuations remained narrow during the half-day, with minimal changes and no escape from the consolidation phase. Ultimately, paper stocks alone rose by 20%, steel stocks were average, and the rest rose by about 5%. Operators adopted different strategies, and the trend became slightly ambiguous. Xiangtai, which had already announced its liquidation, had no buyers at 5,000 yuan yesterday.

### Sichuan Goods Hampered by Transportation

Export Industry Cables Request for Ship Allocations

Sichuan and Xikang export goods such as tung oil, bristles, raw silk, cattle and sheepskins, and medicinal materials have, since the victory, relied on wooden boats for transportation to Shanghai due to the lack of steamer transport, posing a significant risk. In recent months, steamers have been prioritizing the transport of Sichuan grain, further exacerbating the problem. As a result, Sichuan bristles and tung oil have been delayed for a long time. The local export industry has cabled the Chongqing Ship Allocation Committee of the Ministry of Communications, requesting the allocation of ship tonnage to facilitate the transport.

### Glutinous Rice Trends Downward; Other Prices Remain Unchanged

Transactions in the rice market remained scarce yesterday. Rice shops obtained their supply from the Market Management Committee through allocation at a rate of ten dan per household, maintaining stable public sentiment. However, glutinous rice trended downward, with hundred-yuan prices at 49,000 yuan, a sharp drop of 9,000 yuan. Yin yuan was at 42,000 yuan, a drop of 7,000 yuan. Registered customer goods increased yesterday, totaling 1,264 packages and 50 shi, including 378 packages and 50 shi of Yangxian rice, 100 packages of Wuyou rice, 506 packages of brown rice, and 280 packages of milled Xian rice. Flour remained unopened. Bran continued to rise by over one hundred yuan. The oil market saw improved digestion and rose by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Soybeans rose by 500 to 600 yuan. Broad beans were in high demand due to the resumption of operation of speculative shops, and high-quality goods continued to rise by 1,000 yuan, while mid-grade goods remained flat. Wheat from North and South China was moving but not vigorous. Corn and mung beans fell by 1,000 yuan. Bean cakes rose by 200 to 300 yuan.

### Purchase of 150,000 Dan of Japanese Cocoons; Japan Only Agrees to Sell Half; General Ge Jingzhong to Negotiate

The government previously negotiated with General MacArthur's headquarters to purchase 150,000 dan of Japanese autumn cocoons. It is reported that a reply has recently been received, with the Japanese side only agreeing to sell 75,000 dan. Our authorities believe this is insufficient for the silk mills in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Ge Jingzhong, general manager of the China Sericulture Corporation, will travel to Japan to further negotiate with General MacArthur's headquarters, hoping to secure the full supply of the minimum quantity of 150,000 dan to maintain silk exports. It is reported that Mr. Ge will be accompanied by Director Zhou of the technical department of the company and will fly to Japan within days to conduct cocoon purchases and conduct an on-site survey of Japan's post-war silk industry to serve as a reference for improving China's sericulture.

It is also learned that the China Sericulture Corporation, in order to save expenses due to the early passage of the cocoon season, has instructed all cocoon collection points to expedite their closure. After closure, it plans to convene a meeting of those in charge of various points to review the cocoon collection business to improve the technical aspects of autumn cocoon purchases.

### Enemy Paper Mills Resume Production; Output Exceeds 3,000 Tons

Last month, the China Paper Corporation of the Ministry of Economic Affairs was entrusted by the Enemy Property Administration to sell various types of paper from over two hundred warehouses. It is reported that the amount allocated and sold has reached more than half of the total amount. The paper allocated and sold the day before yesterday consisted of transparent paper and glossy paper.

In addition, the seven factories, Sakurai, Dachina, Jinxing, Jiangnan, Guohua, Tianzhang West Factory, and Tianzhang East Factory, under the management of the Shanghai Enemy Property Paper Mill Resumption Guidance Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui District, have reportedly produced 3.483 tons and 3.012 rolls of various types of paper in the eight months from October last year to May this year. It is reported that this paper is also distributed and sold by the China Paper Corporation.

### Summer Woolen Fabrics Are Out of Season; Price Cuts Fail to Attract Buyers

Summer woolen fabrics declined again yesterday. As the sales season has passed, shops are gradually selling off outdated stock. From the perspective of users, Western-style clothing businesses are trying their best to sell off their existing inventory, resulting in a market price reduction of 10,000 yuan per yard, without any actual buyers.

### Limited Bristle Exports

Transactions in the foreign market for bristles remain sluggish. Most of the bristles recently exported were those that had been previously transacted. Although the export volume this month is higher than last month, it is still for orders placed one or two months ago. Six hundred and fifty dan of Sichuan bristles were loaded yesterday and will be shipped to the United States within days. It is reported that there are still over two thousand dan that need to be sorted before they can be shipped.

### Dried Longan Prices Rebound

The price of Xinghua dried longan has recently firmed up due to limited arrivals and aggressive buying by merchants. Huang Si Yuan ordinary quality opened at 178,000 yuan, and premium quality opened at 195,000 to 200,000 yuan. Large-sized white Si Yuan also reached approximately 190,000 yuan. Miscellaneous road large-sized Quanpao longan opened at 105,000 yuan.

### Cuban Sugar Production

New Estimate Lower Than Expected

[United Press, Havana, 24th] According to an announcement by the Ministry of Agriculture, Cuba's total sugar production for this year is not expected to exceed 4,000,000 tons, approximately 500,000 tons less than previously anticipated. The ministry's new estimate is based on reports from 130 sugar mills, whose planned production is 3,368,924 tons. Another 31 sugar mills are still in production and are not included.

### Inspection Office Requests Chamber of Commerce Assistance in Unifying Weights and Measures in the City

Switching Entirely to the Standard System and the Market System

The Weights and Measures Inspection Office sent an official letter, Zong Zi No. 272, to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, stating that the central government has long stipulated that the international metric system be the standard system for weights and measures in our country, supplemented by the market system, with a deadline for unified implementation. Since implementation, provinces and cities have successively followed suit, to the convenience of merchants and people. This city has suffered eight years of destruction under the enemy and puppet regime, and the administration of weights and measures has become chaotic again. While many comply with the statutory system, many still use the maritime foot, English yard, maritime peck, old scale, English pound, and Japanese scale. As this concerns national laws and the interests of the people, it is the duty of this office to send personnel to inspect each industry and eliminate non-compliant practices. To facilitate implementation, we request your chamber to inform all members to switch entirely to the aforementioned new system (i.e., the standard system and the market system) to comply with regulations.

### Malaya Lacks Labor

Rubber Industry to Recruit Chinese Laborers

[Reuters, Singapore, 25th] The main problem with the Malayan rubber industry remains the shortage of labor. As the people's exit regulations promulgated by the Dutch East Indies government remain in effect, the only solution is to recruit Chinese laborers. The repatriation of Indian laborers is still underway, with approximately 2,000 people leaving their industries each period.

### Minister Gu Visits Yangzhou to Allocate Funds; Why Do the Old and Young Wander? When Will They Return Home from Starvation?

Special Correspondent Wang Gonghan, Yangzhou, 22nd

Since the news came that the National Government had ordered Minister of Social Affairs Gu Zheng to oversee relief efforts for refugees in northern Jiangsu, the general public in Yangzhou has had a simple feeling: the central government has not forgotten northern Jiangsu after all! This is a reflection of morale. The origin of this morale reflection, in a broad sense, is because the overall domestic situation after the victory has been a major headache for people; in an even broader sense, the successive "security" and "peace" conferences of the League of Nations have always been shrouded in unfortunate shadows, and people are always worried and fearful of a "third world war," which seems to be on the verge of erupting. People are not the same as they were before the eight-year war of resistance, and their understanding, analysis, and vigilance regarding the international situation have all improved. In a narrower sense, the environment in Yangzhou for many years has been one of outward relaxation and inward tension, with constant storms, and people have felt uneasy. Rice prices, like those in other places, even broke through the 60,000 yuan mark at one point.

Several Timely Rains; New Wheat Has Appeared

Fortunately, in the past two weeks, there have been several timely rains, and new wheat has appeared on the market. In addition, the Shanghai municipal government resolutely suppressed rice prices, which has also had some impact here. (Commodity prices in Yangzhou blindly follow Shanghai.) The rice price here has now retreated to the 50,000 yuan level.

Just as people were finding some small comfort in their disappointment, Minister Gu really came to Yangzhou and allocated 100 million yuan in funds and 230,000 bags of flour to Yangzhou, which greatly pleased people.

The refugees from various counties in northern Jiangsu who have fled to Yangzhou are not entirely satisfied with the amount of funds allocated to Yangzhou by Minister Gu, because according to the principles and methods of using the funds announced by Minister Gu, they must be used to improve refugee reception centers (such as repairing houses, doors, and windows) and to run civilian canteens, small-loan programs, and refugee medical institutions. In this way, the actual amount that can be distributed to each refugee can be imagined to be very little. However, the refugees also understand and trust: "The government's power can only do so much at present." Moreover, as Minister Gu said well: "A small amount of material assistance is certainly of no help, but as the saying goes, sending a goose feather from a thousand miles away shows the sender's good intentions."

Minister Gu Consoles; Refugees Weep Together

Therefore, the refugees are always grateful for the central government's remembering them. This is manifested in their behavior: prostrating and crying bitterly upon seeing Minister Gu. In the "Parliamentary Courtyard," when Minister Gu went to inspect and comfort the refugees on the morning of the 19th, everyone cried. At another refugee reception center, when Minister Gu went to inspect and comfort the refugees, Guo Rucheng, a Baoying refugee and graduate of Jinling University, saw Minister Gu, turned around and bowed, while complaining about his suffering: yesterday, he sold a small wall hanging to get through the day. These scenes made everyone who went to visit with him's eyelashes become moist.

Three-Year-Old Boy Sold for 500,000

That same evening, just as I returned home, my wife pointed to our third child, who was napping, and said to me with a smile: "There are people outside who are willing to sell a three-year-old child for 500,000 yuan. Would you be willing to sell him?" Then, she told me that someone from a Shanghai-based bank had sent someone to Yangzhou to sell a three-year-old boy. As a result, a poor refugee team sold the three-year-old child for 500,000 yuan. After listening to my wife's words, I looked at my own child, who was sleeping so sweetly, and deeply thought about the difficulties of the generally impoverished.

During the refugee registration process, there were phenomena of secretly impoverished people who were unwilling to register automatically. Therefore, the Yangzhou Office of the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association, which was established here not long ago, held a symposium on the morning of the 20th. The first issue discussed was how to find ways to persuade secretly impoverished people to register automatically.

Minister Gu came to Yangzhou on the 19th, and on the 20th, he went to Taixian with the chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government to inspect the area. It was reported that he returned to Zhenjiang and then to Shanghai on the 21st. This is equivalent to saying that the refugee relief efforts in this corner of Yangzhou and Taixian can be considered to have come to an end.

But in the reporter's mind, I cannot erase the words on a couplet inside a refugee reception center here: "The old and young, for whom do they wander? Enduring hunger and waiting for food, when will they return home?"

### Ms. Bileks Comes From Xinjiang

Reporter Zhang Ming, Nanjing, 20th

Even today, when transportation is smooth and fast, we cannot help but feel a sense of remoteness when it comes to Xinjiang, which has already opened its doors! Xinjiang's area is equal to the total area of the nine northeastern provinces, which are closely related to us at present. It is fifteen times the size of Zhejiang, accounting for 14.690% of China's entire territory, totaling 1,641,554 square kilometers. The province also has the Pamir Plateau's Congling Mountains, known as the roof of the world, the Tianshan Mountains, which are said to have been traveled by the Tang monk Xuanzang when he went to fetch scriptures, and the ever-changing desert, allowing us to imagine. What a place that is enough to evoke stories of heroes and knights!

This time, taking advantage of the opportunity of the arrival of the National Assembly representatives from Xinjiang in Beijing, I made a long-awaited visit.

### I Discovered Great Differences Between Us

A total of four people came: Ms. Bileks, a National Assembly representative from Xinjiang, Hua Shengmu, an executive member of the Xinjiang Provincial Party Headquarters and deputy director of the Department of Civil Affairs, Sadti Kushi, principal of the Dihua Municipal Women's Central School, and Wu Tiekuer, a translator for the National Assembly representative.

I knew in advance that I would not be able to communicate with them directly, so I first found the translator, Mr. Wu. Mr. Wu was tall and slender, wearing a Western suit, and looked no different from a Han Chinese. So I felt relieved and went to interview Ms. Bileks. However, at first sight, I was amazed. The differences between her and me were too great. She had white skin, large and round eyes, beautiful and long braids, and a healthy and strong physique. She wore Westernized clothing without any affectation. There was clearly nothing in common between her and me.

This visit was based entirely on my curiosity and novelty, so I did not ask her big questions, and I started with small questions first!

### Talking About Small Problems; Hair, Cheongsam, Clothing Material

"Why is your hair so long?"

"Long hair is in fashion."

"Are there any short hairstyles?"

"No."

"Your clothes are very beautiful. Isn't this style entirely foreign?"

"It doesn't matter if it's foreign. We just look at our trends. Whatever style is popular is the style we wear. This is the most popular now."

"Do you wear cheongsam?"

"No."

"Where does the clothing material come from?"

"Mostly from the Soviet Union. There used to be British goods, but there are none now. However, Xinjiang can weave very good floral silk and also produce famous felt!" Ms. Bileks said happily, showing considerable pride.

### Marriage System; Based Entirely on Religious Doctrine

Then I asked about the marriage system. She replied to the reporter:

"Our marriages are based on religious doctrine, which means that we cannot marry people of different faiths. As for other customs, we are now more free. According to etiquette, women cannot go out casually!"

At this time, Mr. Wu interjected to tell the reporter: "Representative Bileks is a director of the Xinjiang Provincial Women's Association!"

This woman is obviously very naive. She is only twenty-two years old, but she is also very capable. As the reporter listened to Mr. Wu's translation, she slowly began to write Chinese characters on the side with a pen. I thought this was increasing my interest. I asked her, "How can you write?" She smiled, and Mr. Wu answered for her, "Because there are many Han Chinese coming and going in the provincial capital, she often interacts with them and can also understand some Chinese. It is inconvenient to speak," and she can barely write characters like a student in the lower grades of elementary school. She is very clever. Obviously, after the reporter asked these small questions, she asked another question: "I heard that you do not welcome people from outside, is that true?"

She almost became anxious and mumbled a lot of flat, monotonous words, asking Mr. Wu to translate them to me. She said,

"This is not our opinion, and it has already passed. When Sheng Shicai ruled Xinjiang, he was like imprisoning us in a prison, constantly issuing a kind of terror policy. He was dictatorial and successively closed down 120,000 outstanding people, and he confiscated the property of ordinary people. All political and economic power was under his high pressure. Especially in the last year or two, he implemented a policy of assimilation and intermarriage, attempting to eliminate our Xinjiang ethnic groups. It was at that time that he did not welcome people from outside, because he did not want others to know about his cruelty. So if anyone went, he would harm them to prevent them from spreading the word."

Then, she said again:

"We have no power to refuse anyone from coming to Xinjiang."

### The Yining Incident; First Gave Them Pain

Below, she told me how much pain the occurrence of the Yining incident had given them. She went on to say:

"Now, Chairman Zhang is very good. His arrival was able to peacefully resolve the Yining incident. We are grateful for Chairman Zhang's spirit of universal love. He is great."

From this, we know that in different faiths, we cannot force any of their behaviors.

I saw that she was speaking too nervously and angrily, so I changed the topic.

"If I go to Xinjiang, would you welcome me?"

"Welcome, and I hope you will come back with us this time!"

I liked her naivete and stayed for a long time before leaving. Finally, we mutually agreed to "see you again in Xinjiang!"

### Desert Camel Caravans: How Much They Inspire Yearning

A story has enlightened me about Xinjiang. Besides the geographical barriers that naturally isolate it from the inland, considerable misunderstandings persist regarding religion and human relations. However, these misunderstandings are clearly diminishing today!

Xinjiang comprises seventy-nine counties with a population of over five million. Seventy percent of the population is engaged in agriculture, predominantly in Southern Xinjiang, where their influence is greater. Nomadic people constitute twenty percent, mainly in Northern Xinjiang, with the remainder involved in commerce and industry.

The region is rich in resources. In terms of minerals, there are gold, silver, copper, iron, lead, coal, petroleum, and jade. However, these resources are under government control, and plans for their development have yet to be fully implemented.

Furthermore, representatives say: "We have apples as large as teacups, sweet Hami melons, various fruits, and vegetables." Indeed, Xinjiang is a tempting name, and we demand to enjoy Xinjiang! To develop Xinjiang!

However, Xinjiang faces serious ethnic issues, serious religious issues, and serious language issues.

Their religions include Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam. Languages spoken include Turkish, Persian, Mongolian, Manchu, and Chinese. Written languages include Chinese, Uyghur, Manchu, and Mongolian. Ethnically, there are typically fourteen groups: Han, Manchu, Xibe, Solon, Mongolian, Chahar, Torghut, Uyghur, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Tajik, Han Hui, Tatar, and naturalized Russians.

Among them, the Uyghur people are the most numerous, accounting for seventy percent of the total population, mainly residing in the south. Therefore, discussing ethnic issues today is not too daunting, as besides the large Uyghur group, all others are small subgroups.

I long for the camel caravans in the desert, for the precocious Turkish-style girls, and even more for the Hami melons, and for the teacup-sized apples.

### Contradictory Siamese Mentality

— Wu Hong

Bangkok, 18th (Airmail)

When Japan launched the Pacific War, Siam fell and was forced to participate in the so-called "Greater East Asia War," declaring war on the United Nations. After the restoration of peace, the United States was generous and tolerant, treating Siam with composure and without imposing any conditions. However, the British, with their stronger feudalistic mindset, were unwilling to relinquish their vested interests, considering Siam an enemy state and compelling it to sign a ceasefire agreement. Siam reluctantly agreed to pay a compensation of thirty million tons of white rice and five million pounds sterling in war expenses. Losses suffered by British residents in Siam due to war damage or Allied bombings were to be compensated or rebuilt by Siam. Furthermore, the export of timber produced in Siam required British approval after the agreement was signed. As British troops have not yet withdrawn, the Siamese people seem extremely troubled by the British, displaying an expression of helplessness. Towards the overseas Chinese, they retain their traditional mentality of extreme contempt. After Japan's surrender, they even carried out massacres of our compatriots over trivial matters, arousing public outrage in our country. Subsequently, a delegation was sent to China, where they witnessed the true situation of our country: vast in land and rich in resources, with a strong national defense. The people, in general, were elegant and polite, a stark contrast to the barefooted and half-naked laborers they saw in their own country. Only then did they recognize the true face of our country and realize that China was not to be trifled with. Upon their return, they propagated their impressions, and the Siamese people began to treat the overseas Chinese with less disdain than before. There is a growing hope for improved Sino-Siamese relations. However, it is still hoped that our compatriots will respect their own dignity and not lose the demeanor of a great nation, lest they be despised by foreign races.

### Lower-Ranking Officers Cry Out for Help!

Editor Guang Sheng: I am a soldier. I joined the army in my teens. After eight years of fighting, I earned victory with blood and sweat, and I also earned the rank of lower-ranking officer. Chairman has repeatedly instructed: "Nation-building is more important than resistance against Japan. We must bring the spirit of resistance against Japan to complete the great task of nation-building." True, even after victory, we are still constantly on the move, protecting our compatriots who have suffered in the depths of misery for eight years. This is our responsibility, and we are suffering, but we will not complain. But our suffering is unknown to anyone. We eat rationed rice that ordinary people have never tasted, and as for vegetables, let alone anything else, we eat whatever is cheap. We haven't had pork or fish in years. We don't even have mats to sleep on, just burrowing into straw. We have seen with our own eyes that there are many military supplies among the materials received from the enemy and puppets. Why can't they give us even one blanket? As for pay, privates get 900 yuan per month, privates first class get 1,050 yuan, and corporals get 1,200 yuan. They work hard for a month without being able to take a bath, eat a decent meal, or buy a pair of shoes. Good heavens! I lead over a hundred soldiers, and they are barefoot every day, unable to maintain their daily lives. How can the soldiers be at ease? I tell them every day that the superiors will definitely find a way to solve the problems of those of us who fought to the death. As a result, all we hear is "salary increase, salary increase," but the poor soldiers are still the same! As a captain, I currently receive a monthly living allowance of 45,000 yuan, 140 times my base salary, plus 8,000 yuan for food expenses, totaling 64,280 yuan (including vegetable money and firewood). With such high living expenses, making a suit costs over 20,000 yuan, and a pair of cloth shoes costs over 10,000 yuan. How can we afford to shave and bathe? And to make matters worse, after being separated from my parents for a full ten years, my fiancée and I fled from the "bandit area" last month. I managed to support them for a month, but now I really have no way! Heavens! I'm so desperate I want to commit suicide! I hope the newspaper can appeal on my behalf, asking the authorities to quickly resolve the suffering of us soldiers. From Yang Shiling of Yixing, June 17.

### The Shanghai West Mounted Patrol is Effective

Editor: The Shanghai Police Bureau, in view of the serious security issues in the western suburbs of Shanghai, has ordered the patrol team to station in Shanghai IV to maintain security. A few days ago, the team sent a detachment leader, Xi Zunhan, with about fifty police officers to station in western Shanghai, at the former Annamese barracks at 648 Jianguo West Road. It is heard that they will also move towards the suburbs in order to control the security of the suburbs. Their mission focuses on nighttime, patrolling in shifts from 2 PM every day. Under the scorching sun, walking on the suburban Zhongshan Road and Hongqiao Road is indeed a difficult task. I see that every time they return from patrol, they are always covered in sweat, their clothes soaked through. They still smile and return to the camp with a pleasant mood, and they also do a horse drill every morning, energetic and full of vitality, which is admirable. Although the team has only been stationed for a short time, those elements who disrupt the public order have seen the brave warriors riding tall horses, constantly changing shifts for patrol, and dare not appear so recklessly anymore. I hope these warriors will not be half-hearted and will continue to do their work diligently. I also hope that the police bureau can station another unit in the suburbs of Zhabei and Nanshi. I believe it will be very effective in addressing security issues. From Zhou Xianlong, June 18.

### Social Service: Real Cases of the Lonely, Widowed, Poor, and Sick. Elder Qingxia is Willing to Provide Relief.

A detailed plan will be released once relief strategies have been discussed.

To whom it may concern: I am a humble person. I lost my parents at a young age, leaving me lonely and helpless. I struggled for survival in society, striving for self-improvement, and fortunately avoided starvation and exposure. My wife and I often look back on the painful experiences of the past twenty years, and we are even more motivated to provide relief to the elderly, weak, widowed, and orphaned. I believe that there are many charitable organizations in Shanghai, and my efforts are limited, so I rarely donate to them. I have always admired your esteemed newspaper for its social services, and I dare to write this special letter requesting your help. If there are any lonely, widowed, and orphaned individuals who are unable to make a living, or any poor and sick individuals who are unable to afford medical treatment, who are indeed genuine cases, I am willing to provide them with direct assistance, a drop in the bucket, just to comfort my heart. If you are willing to accept my request, I hope you will reply in your newspaper so that I can take action. I am, with respect, Qingxia Elder.

[Editor's Reply] We have read your letter and are pleased to learn that you are willing to provide direct assistance to lonely, widowed, and orphaned individuals who are unable to make a living, or to poor and sick individuals who are unable to afford medical treatment. This demonstrates your kindness and compassion for those in need, and we are deeply touched! Regarding how to proceed, we respectfully request that you visit us in person to discuss the matter (any time in the morning or afternoon). As your original letter did not include your address, we are sending this reply through the mail. We pray for your response.

### Responding to Readers

Legal Inquiries

(1) Kang Changle asks: To the Editor: I have a matter that I cannot resolve and would appreciate your guidance. "In the second year of the Republic of China, I mortgaged a house to Sha for 1,000 silver dollars. Now Sha wants to redeem it. Regarding the redemption price, some say it should be based on the price of goods in the second year of the Republic of China, some say it should be based on the current price of silver dollars, and some say it should be redeemed with 1,000 yuan of legal tender." In my opinion, the first option is too disadvantageous to the landlord, the third option is too disadvantageous to the tenant, and the second option is more reasonable. But I don't know how it should be resolved. Please advise.

[Lawyer Duanmu Kai replies] It can be handled according to Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Litigation after Restoration.

(2) Zhu Zhengyong asks: I and my friend Jia previously opened a shop as partners, with Jia serving as manager. Since the victory, Jia has gone elsewhere and is said to be suspected of being a traitor. Later, I convened the other shareholders to discuss everything, and it was decided that I would be appointed manager and Jia's shares would be merged into friend Yi's shares. If the case is prosecuted in the future, will I be guilty? Will friend Yi be guilty? How should Jia's shares be disposed of to be legal and innocent? Please answer in your column.

[Lawyer Duanmu Kai replies] According to Article 688, Paragraph 1 of the Civil Code, if there is a legitimate reason, Jia can only be expelled from the partnership. As for his shares, they are a kind of private property, and according to the principle that private rights cannot be disposed of by others, it is not legal to merge Jia's shares into Yi's shares.

### Do Not Buy Counterfeit Milk Powder

Editor: I am a patient who needs long-term care, so my elderly father often takes a portion of his hard-earned salary to buy milk powder and similar things and asks someone to bring it from Shanghai. The other day, my father bought two pounds of loose milk powder because the American milk powder in the market was out of stock, costing 6,000 yuan. When I received it, I saw a hard lump like plaster in the paper bag. I thought it was caused by dampness. I cut some with a knife and tried to eat it, but it was starchy with a biscuit taste. I really don't know what it was made of! But the powder was very fine when purchased, and the color and smell were similar to the real product. After being deceived, I should like to borrow a corner of your newspaper to disclose it, to punish the abominable merchants, and to prevent the ignorant from being deceived again, I would be very fortunate! I wish you peace in writing. Zhu Zhiyan Respectfully.

### Returning Home

— Shao Fu

Over three million refugees from Northern Jiangsu have fled to other places, with over 50,000 arriving in Shanghai daily. Some have already initiated the establishment of the Shanghai Fundraising Association for the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association. Before proceeding with this work, I would like to appeal to our fellow citizens in Shanghai to generously donate.

For the past eight years, the compatriots of Northern Jiangsu have been living in dire straits. There was no way to help them back when the enemy and puppets were entrenched there. Now that the war of resistance has been won, for them to continue suffering from family destruction and displacement is something the compatriots of Northern Jiangsu feel very angry and wronged about. Even those of us who are not in this situation feel very angry as well. The reason is simple: there is no reason for them to suffer this pain, and there is no value in suffering this pain.

Therefore, in addition to launching a large-scale emergency relief movement today, we should actively seek a thorough solution from the root for the more than three million refugees from Northern Jiangsu who are displaced elsewhere. Otherwise, our relief efforts will lose their meaning and will not achieve satisfactory results.

What is the most fundamental way to help the refugees from Northern Jiangsu?

"Returning home."

### Shanghai University Students and Chongqing University Students

— Wang Shanben

Now that the restoration has begun, and universities from the rear areas are relocating to Shanghai and Nanjing, students from both places are unfamiliar with each other's backgrounds, causing many to worry about future coexistence and cooperation. After returning to Shanghai from Chongqing, classmates and friends like to ask for my opinion on the students from both places. It is difficult to make a general statement on this point. In Chongqing, I heard (just heard) that after Jiaotong University students arrived in Shanghai, there was a distinction between Chongqing and Shanghai, clearly drawing an insurmountable gap. In essence, students from both places do have their own characteristics, but these differences are not insurmountable, as long as we thoroughly understand where these differences lie. Based on my personal observations, I will list the differences below:

(1) Age of Students: Students in Chongqing come from all directions, either trekking through the war zones or fleeing from other places. Many have delayed their studies, and some have graduated from high school but are unable to afford further education, so many have worked outside for several years before entering university. Therefore, the average age of university students in Chongqing is higher than in Shanghai. The average age of students entering university is generally over twenty, while in Shanghai, it is most common to be eighteen or nineteen, and there are even those who are sixteen or seventeen. Personally, when I was in Shanghai, I was considered to be in the middle to upper range of my classmates' ages, but in Chongqing, I was the youngest of the eleven in our dormitory (dormitory mates were mostly from the same class), with the oldest being five or six years older than me.

(2) Quality of Environment: Studying at a university in Shanghai is somewhat luxurious. Children from ordinary impoverished families do not dare to harbor this extravagant hope, so Shanghai university students live a more comfortable life. On the other hand, most university students in Chongqing are far from their hometowns, without support, and rely on public funds to make a living.

(3) Acuteness of Political Perception: Chongqing is the political center, and the movements of the world and the progress and retreat of the country are well understood. In particular, newspapers and magazines of various parties and factions and various colors are filled with information. In this environment, university students who care about national affairs can observe, analyze, compare, and synthesize, and have a clearer understanding of the political situation.

On the other hand, Shanghai was controlled by the enemy and puppet forces in the past, and the life of the university was barely surviving under close watch. It was difficult to have political activities, and even more accurate reports were difficult to obtain, so the atmosphere was naturally different.

Based on the above three differences, the conclusions we have reached are as follows:

Most of the university students in Chongqing, apart from the natives of Sichuan, have struggled out of the edge of death. They are older and know the value of knowledge and the vicissitudes of life. Because they study hard, they are naturally willing to put in more effort. Last July, when a ferryboat capsized at Fudan University, three students were tragically drowned. They were all authors, and especially one student from the Department of Foreign Languages, had published and unpublished works and translations totaling more than one million words. With two years of hard work in university, he was able to achieve such results. Even if it was crudely made, the diligence is imaginable. Because they are economically strapped, they rarely go out and only seek to keep their bodies warm in terms of clothing, with no extravagance. Therefore, they can be quiet and study diligently.

However, their response to politics is not so silent. Often one school can represent a social organization, carrying banners of various colors, shouting slogans of various parties and factions, attacking and scolding each other. Their clearer understanding of politics is a strength, but the disruption caused by a small number of stubborn and unscrupulous elements who take the opportunity to cause trouble, incite incidents, and destroy the harmony that a university should have is indeed a great regret.

As for Shanghai, the environment is harsh, and the youth are in this warm and splendid cradle of the city. Who can remain unmoved? Thus, they are inevitably distracted from their studies.

A great advantage of Shanghai university students is also a shortcoming of Chongqing university students, that is, the latter are old in the world and often have too much hypocrisy and pretense, while the former are younger, more enthusiastic, willing to do things, and willing to sacrifice. However, Shanghai students' attention to fashion and decoration and their pursuit of vanity are a major obstacle on the path of learning.

Finally, I believe that university students in both places have their own strengths and weaknesses. As long as they can be tolerant and understanding of each other, and in their interactions, give up their shortcomings and take their strengths, a happy and harmonious atmosphere can be created.

— Photographed by Yu Chuangshuo

Willow catkins dance in the breeze, and countless yachts float on the rippling lake. When you feel the long summer days and the sultry heat, you can wash away your troubles and worries here, whiling away the days and finding peace of mind. Comparable to West Lake, you won't miss Xuanwu Lake when you first arrive in Nanjing.

### On the Ye Family Garden

— Zhang Rongbang

In the sweltering summer, when it is stiflingly hot, everyone wants to go to a cool summer resort. Places like Huangpu Park, Zhongzheng Park, and Hongkou Park in Shanghai are crowded with bustling tourists. The purpose of these people going there is simply to breathe some fresh air, enjoy the coolness, and invigorate their spirits.

As for the Ye Family Garden, it is only a few miles from the city. If you take a car, you can reach this "Summer Paradise" in less than fifteen minutes. Of course, I have already visited it once. You ask what my impression is? Well, let me say a little.

Couples, hand in hand, whisper sweet nothings among the flowers and plants; you can tell by their reluctant expressions.

Beautiful "young ladies" sit by the pond learning to fish, and when they see someone catch a big fish, they are overjoyed!

There are many fish in the pond, swimming back and forth on the surface of the water. Armed comrades shoot at the pond, and those they hit weigh about a pound. If someone picks it up and takes it home, they can have a good meal!

The pond water is very deep, but unfortunately, it is "stagnant water," too dirty! Otherwise, you could go for a swim, because Shanghai doesn't have such a large swimming pool. I think: if it could be changed to "flowing water" in the future, then the garden would become more lively!

If someone were to organize "summer camps," "summer tutoring classes," or "reading groups," I think it would be great to set them up here. Because there are clear bird songs, lush forests, and bright wildflowers. This can cultivate your temperament. Tao Yuanming loved flowers, plants, and trees very much, and that is the reason why modern people can "excerpt" this point and learn it.

The oily green grass grows vigorously on the flat ground, swaying in the breeze like a large green carpet, inviting the weary to lie down and take a nap.

The "cuckoo" bird calls on the cypress branches, as if it is specially waiting to "welcome" and "farewell"—tourists alike. This adds to the liveliness of the garden!

There are several "pavilions" and several "rockeries" and several artificial "underground caves" in the garden. These "underground caves" really resemble the "air raid shelters" of "Chongqing" during the war, and it is indeed a bit cool and chilly inside!

However, there are shortcomings. Some places in the garden are very messy and not well-maintained, not as clean and beautiful as the city parks. Several pavilions are already falling into disrepair!

It is said that this garden was built by the late Central Committee member, Mr. Ye Chucang. He dedicated his life to the party and the country, and died of overwork. It is a great pity! Now that he is dead! We hope that prominent figures in society will donate funds to renovate this "scenic" garden!—on the one hand, to commemorate him, and on the other hand, to allow tourists from afar to come and visit and admire—this "summer sanctuary"!

### Calling Brother Eats Meat

— Wang Deyun

Do you think "Calling Brother" (referring to a cricket) only eats vegetarian food? Not necessarily!

Once, I jokingly put a grasshopper into the "Calling Brother" cage. Unexpectedly, the "Calling Brother" inside suddenly pounced with fangs and claws, biting the head of the grasshopper in one go, and immediately chewed loudly, "kuo kuo" sound. The poor grasshopper, its wings and feet fluttered wildly, looked extremely painful.

This time, I was stunned! My body couldn't help but feel half cold! I sighed and said: Alas, you can know the face of an insect, but not its heart!

Really, even the heart of an insect is unknowable, let alone the heart of "all things party"?

Friends, beware of high-sounding demagogues!

### Crazy Masters

— Dongfang Jing

In mental sanatoriums, there are many patients with outstanding artistic talents, such as sculpture, painting, and music. These talents sometimes do not disappear because of mental illness.

For example, the great composer Robert Schumann died in a mental hospital, but he continued to create masterpieces even after he developed significant mental illness. The 18th-century poet William Cowper wrote exquisite poems in a mental hospital. The New York State Hospital displays some beautiful sculptures that are the posthumous works of a master sculptor who was insane.

Three Words and Two Words Collection

### Burning Grain Instead of Fuel

— Wuling Ren

The Fujian Provincial Government has approved the Xiamen Municipal Government's measures for publicly managing prostitutes and collecting fees. These fees will be used to improve the salaries of civil servants. In other words, the livelihood of civil servants depends on the efforts of prostitutes. It is indeed a bit...no wonder civil servants have a feeling of both laughter and tears upon hearing the news.

I once heard a story: "A ship full of grain floated out to sea, but because it forgot to bring fire, it could not cook, and the entire ship starved to death." According to a recent Reuters dispatch from Argentina, Argentina could have exported even more grain, but due to a lack of fuel and a severe shortage of tires, transportation was inconvenient, so it had to burn grain instead of fuel. From this, we can see that any valuable thing in the world becomes useless or unusable when it cannot function.

Someone may say: China is experiencing a famine in various places, and people are gnawing on tree bark to relieve hunger. If transportation were convenient, China and Argentina could exchange grain for fuel, which would benefit both sides.

A Reuters dispatch from London: Miss Ding Siter of Lee, wrote to US Ambassador Harriman, volunteering to test atomic bombs instead of animals suffering. What an admirable young lady! Your heart is compassionate enough. But how can the authorities bear to accept your request? I believe you can gain the nickname "Atomic Miss" from this. Isn't the name "Atomic" for a young lady the most fashionable thing today? This should be congratulated for you!

### Pan Sanxing's Residence—I Wonder What It Is Used For Now

— Feng Yi

During the enemy's occupation, Pan Sanxing ran racecourse gambling halls and was the backstage boss of football teams, living a very exciting life. At the same time, he also owned a tall building, which was the most exciting part of his exciting life. This mansion was the famous 201 Jubo Rice Road, with the pseudonym Pan Xing written in the commonplace book. Speaking of this mansion, after Pan Sanxing's repeated renovations, the interior was truly magnificent and extremely exciting. The dance floor and stage were fully equipped, and it could accommodate two to three hundred people, with room to spare. The entire building required seven telephones to maintain communication, and it often needed twenty "boy" to manage the various rooms. At that time, among the private residences in Shanghai, its grand scale and luxurious layout could be said to be second to none. After the victory, Sanxing was arrested, so his ill-gotten property became the most interesting thing for everyone. It was once rumored that the mansion would be allocated as Marshall's residence, but because Ambassador Ma did not have time to stay in Shanghai for a long time, it was changed to other uses. Nowadays, everyone is panicking and clamoring for housing shortages all day long. If we can truly follow President Chiang's principle of resolving the housing shortage, limiting each person to 100 square meters, then people like you and me are qualified to occupy a seat inside. In fact, the housing shortage in Shanghai is not as serious as the common people imagine. There is more than one such mansion on the Shanghai Bund. So, when it comes down to it, the problem is that there are too many agencies coming to Shanghai and too many officials, so you get a building, and I get a building, and there will never be enough to distribute. Even A Mao's grandfather took a building, and A Mao's mother's brother also took a building. Some officials who are stationed thousands of miles away also come to Shanghai to get a few mansions as official residences, leaving only one or two "old family members" to watch the door. Under these circumstances, you and I, the little people, have to sleep in pigeon cages and on the side of the road.

### Atomic Bomb—First Lands on the Surface of the Sea

— Jianan

In early July, the world's attention will be focused on a group of remote islands in the Pacific Ocean. The joint atomic bomb test conducted by the US Army and Navy will be launched there with earth-shattering force.

Vice Admiral Landy, commander of the First Joint Special Task Force and commander of the US atomic bomb test (please refer to the bronze image on the right), wrote an article on this matter, published in the June 8th issue of "Collier's" Weekly. He explained the details of the US preparations for the atomic bomb test, except for the parts related to national defense secrets, in great detail. Now, let's excerpt the main points below.

The United States plans to conduct three atomic bomb tests. The first atomic bomb will be dropped in the air and explode hundreds of feet above the water surface. Below is a fleet of ships of various types. Scientists expect the power of the explosion to be as fierce as that unleashed in Nagasaki, but no one can predict the results. The purpose of the experiment is also here. The one held in early July is just the first.

Two more tests will be held after this, with dates yet to be determined. In the second test, an atomic bomb will be detonated slightly below the water surface in the center of a fleet of ships. It is expected that the waves raised at that time will reach a height of one hundred feet, generating a hurricane with a speed of one thousand miles per hour, and the temperature will be calculated in tens of millions of degrees. We also want to know what impact various ships will suffer under such circumstances.

Explosion in Water—Huge Impact on the Earth

In the third test, an atomic bomb will be detonated half a mile deep in the ocean below the ships. To date, we can assume that we know nothing about the situation of an atomic bomb exploding deep in the ocean. We have no idea what the results will be. The purpose of the experiment is to explore the impact of the explosion on submarines and other ships in the test area. But one thing worth considering is that an atomic bomb exploding in the water may cause a continuous chain reaction in the seawater or cause radioactivity. There are indeed many people in the world who worry that the unlimited chain reaction of seawater may blow up the entire earth into ashes. But scientific experts believe that this will not happen.

After the results of these tests are determined, we can further know how to improve the defense aspect when building warships in the future, and we can be fearless about the power of atomic bombs. We can also know what impact atomic bombs have on aircraft in the air, as well as tanks, artillery, and other military equipment, and then provide appropriate protection.

In order to conduct the atomic bomb test, an appropriate location must be selected. This location should be within the scope of US control, at least five hundred miles away from the mainland, and the terrain, climate, and wind direction must meet the conditions of the test. We have searched dozens of locations in the Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea, and the Pacific Ocean, but they were rejected due to shallow water, too many people, or unreliable climate. In the end, Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands was selected.

Bikini Island is about twenty-one miles long and eleven miles wide. The many small coral islands around it are distributed like a necklace, with a blue sea in the middle. The island has only more than one hundred and sixty residents. At the same time, in gratitude to the US military for liberating them from the tyranny of the Japanese army, they voluntarily moved away from the island and went to Rongirik Island, one hundred and thirty-five miles to the east. In addition, the climate and wind direction on Bikini Island are relatively less variable.

Seventy Warships—Sacrificed for the Experiment

A total of seventy ships are prepared to be sacrificed in this test, including battleships, aircraft carriers, destroyers, submarines, cruisers, landing craft, transport ships, and all kinds of ships. At the same time, in order to test the power of atomic bombs against German and Japanese warships, the German heavy cruiser "Prinz Eugen" and the Japanese dreadnought "Nagato" are also included. Aircraft, tanks, trucks, mortars, jeeps, self-propelled artillery, radar, and radio equipment will also be placed on the decks of the ships to test the extent to which atomic bombs can destroy the weapons of the army and marines. There are also mannequins, uniforms, gas masks, ammunition belts, canned rations, etc. Everything is complete.

Of course, there cannot be a single human being within ten miles around, but we believe that it is necessary to study the reaction of atomic bombs on living things, so some ships are equipped with animals such as rats, sheep, and pigs.

According to reports from oceanographers and meteorologists, we have built steel-concrete observation posts in the safest places, equipped with the most sensitive cameras. The ships of the First Joint Special Task Force began to gather from late May and set anchor in Bikini Island Harbor. The B-29 aircraft of the 509th Composite Air Group will take off from the Kwajalein Island base and patrol the target area to conduct exercises. It was this group of aircraft that dropped the atomic bombs on Japan.

On the day of the atomic bomb test, there were about 30,000 people involved in this work. In advance, everyone must stick to their posts to ensure that nothing goes wrong. The atomic bomb will generally be dropped in the morning, assuming that the climate must be absolutely clear, so that the bomber can prepare to drop the bomb without the slightest mistake.

At about 9:30, fighter planes and bombers will fly over the target area at different altitudes. These aircraft are controlled by radio in order to test the radioactivity that is distributed in the air when the atomic bomb explodes. Whether these aircraft can "escape" is certainly a big question, but they must try their best to fly back to the base.

The First Experiment—Costs 500 Million US Dollars

At the same time, a Superfortress carrying an atomic bomb will take off from the Kwajalein Island base, step by step, to fly to a height of 30,000 feet, and then open the bomb bay and drop the bomb on the target area. At that time, there will be a flash of light that is unimaginable to humans. Those engaged in observation work must wear special protective glasses, even those who are more than ten miles away are no exception. The column of smoke created by the atomic bomb will rush into the sky, reaching a height of about 30,000 feet, like an enormous umbrella. The tragic situation inside this giant umbrella can only be compared to the "destruction of the world" described in the Bible.

At the time of the atomic bomb explosion, in addition to the radio-driven aircraft flying in the middle, there will also be radio-driven small boats shuttling around the harbor, measuring the radiation at each stage of the experiment. After a considerable amount of time, the first batch of investigators will go to the restricted area under the protection of special equipment to check the bombing situation of aircraft carriers, battleships, small boats, as well as tanks, gas masks, canned rations, sheep, pigs, rats, and other items. All the animals that have been killed by the bombing will be immediately loaded into refrigerated boxes and sent to the laboratory to study, diagnose, prevent, and treat the Japanese so-called "atomic disease." Fish experts will begin to study the tragic situation of marine life in the Bikini area that was "dragged into the disaster." After gathering reports from all parties, the Joint Chiefs of Staff in Washington will conduct a comprehensive study, and the parts that are deemed publishable will be reported to the curious and concerned public around the world.

The cost of these tests is certainly enormous. According to informal estimates, it is roughly around 500 million US dollars.

All thinking people in the world hope that atomic bombs will no longer be used as weapons, and we deeply sympathize with this sincere wish. Our army and navy leaders unanimously hope that the politicians of all countries will soon be able to guarantee that mankind will achieve lasting peace and maintain world order with laws. But before this goal is reached, the armed forces of the United States have a major responsibility to fully study the performance of various weapons, so that they can be fearless in national defense.

### The Story of the Atomic Bomb

— Compiled and Translated by Junmo

Two atomic bombs swiftly brought this brutal war to an end, but also, because of the atomic bomb, suspicion among the world's great powers has intensified, causing them to be filled with anxiety. One atomic bomb in Hiroshima destroyed seventy percent of the city, causing 300,000 casualties. How can an atomic bomb, as small as a golf ball, possess such terrifying power? To answer this mystery, we must first understand what exactly an atom and atomic energy are.

An atom is the smallest structural unit of all matter in the universe, called "Atom" in English. This word comes from Greek, meaning "indivisible." Ninety-four types of atoms have been discovered so far. They are arranged in order of their weight, with the hydrogen atom being the lightest, ranked first, and uranium, the raw material for making atomic bombs, ranked ninety-second. There are three main materials that make up an atom: electrons, protons, and neutrons. An electron is a tiny particle with a fixed amount of negative electric charge. A proton is a tiny particle with a positive electric charge equal to the electron's electric charge. A neutron has no electric charge. Although the true structure of an atom cannot be seen with a microscope, based on the precise experiments and deductions of many scientists, we can know that the interior of an atom is a nucleus composed of protons and neutrons, surrounded by a group of constantly rotating electrons. This situation is roughly similar to the sun and the planets revolving around it.

Speaking of the atomic nucleus, it is the most important part of this problem. The basic structure of the atomic nucleus is protons and neutrons, which we have already mentioned above. Protons carry positive electric charges. When squeezed together, they will not only not get along, but also repel each other. As for neutrons, they do not carry any electric charge, so although they will not repel each other, they will certainly not attract and combine. However, in fact, the atomic nucleus is a thing with very strong binding forces, and it is very difficult to break it down. So, where does this huge binding force come from? According to years of hard work by many scientists, we finally know that this strong binding force is not electrical force at all, but only takes a small part of the mass of neutrons and protons. Once protons and neutrons form an atomic nucleus, they sacrifice several units of mass to be used for the energy required for binding. The mass sacrificed due to this binding is called "mass defect." Interestingly, this loss of mass is not a waste. As long as it is possible to find a way to break the atomic nucleus, then the atomic energy exchanged for a small amount of mass sacrificed when the atomic nucleus splits can be released. Roughly speaking, if the atomic energy hidden deep within the atomic nuclei in a cup of water is completely released, it would be enough for a large ocean liner like the Queen Mary to travel around the world.

So, the current problem is only how to break the atomic nucleus and release atomic energy. Scientists have been studying this problem for many years, going through many failures and improvements. Finally, they implemented the use of uncharged neutrons to break the atomic nucleus. Fortunately, we also discovered that when a uranium atomic nucleus splits, it not only releases a huge amount of energy, but also has new neutrons flying out. These new neutrons then bombard other uranium atoms, releasing more energy and flying out more new neutrons. The principle of the atomic bomb is nothing more than using the huge atomic energy released when the uranium atomic nucleus is broken. The huge heat of the sun is also due to the atomic energy released when the atomic nucleus splits.

Such huge and precious atomic energy exists so abundantly in the universe. If it is used in constructive work, it can advance human civilization by leaps and bounds. But if atomic energy is unfortunately used in destructive warfare, then the entire world will be reduced to ashes.

At 8:16 a.m. on August 6th of last year, the first atomic bomb exploded over Hiroshima, uprooting most of the city, and the number of casualties reached over 300,000. The places bombed by the atomic bomb are so barren that even grass cannot grow, turning into a wasteland.

An exploding atomic bomb is like a ball of fire, its central temperature reaching ten billion degrees, which is about 10,000 times stronger than the heat generated by an ordinary bomb explosion. This temperature, which is hotter than molten iron pouring out of a smelting furnace, can turn everything it touches into ashes. Not only that, but the explosiveness of an atomic bomb is also different from that of any other explosive. It also generates a force called light pressure. Originally, sunlight or lamplight also have pressure, but because it is too small, we don't notice it much, but scientists have already calculated this pressure in the laboratory. Here, we don't need to cite any mathematical formulas, but roughly speaking, the light pressure generated by an atomic bomb explosion will be 1,000,000,000,000,000 times greater than the pressure of an ordinary bomb. Such an amazingly large pressure will not only make it impossible for humans nearby to survive, but also cause huge storms, climate changes, and continuous large and small earthquakes in the months or even years that follow.

### In the Atomic Age, the Navy Moves to Undersea Operations: Admiral Nimitz's View

— Jianan

Admiral Nimitz's views are very pertinent. He absolutely does not admit that the navy is useless, but admits that in the atomic age, the navy must implement revolutionary changes. The power of the atom is indeed amazing, but before its use is fully determined, immediately advocating the cancellation of the navy is an irresponsible argument.

The atomic bomb test to be held in the Bikini Islands on July 1 is aimed at the question of "what is the impact of the atomic bomb on the navy." All reforms will be carefully considered based on the results of this experiment, and no conclusions can be drawn yet. However, from a general point of view, there are already some signs to be found.

According to the opinions of general experts, the future navy may partially or even completely operate underwater. Nimitz also agreed with this point.

Once the navy emphasizes underwater operations, submarines will obviously occupy an important position. Nimitz said: In today's world where radar detectors are widely used, whether it is ground defense equipment or aircraft in the air, they cannot escape this "mysterious eye." Only submarines traveling underwater are not easily detected. Therefore, if you use submarines to launch atomic rockets near the enemy's coast or transport troops to land, you can achieve the effect of "surprise attack." Furthermore, although the power of atomic bombs in deep water is still unclear because it has not been tested, according to ordinary academic speculation, its destructive range is roughly smaller than in the air, although the shock force is much greater. According to the opinions of some American submarine personnel, the only warships that can exist in future atomic wars are submarines. This statement is not without reason.

However, the American submarine fleet, which has already exerted great power in the First World War, still has many shortcomings in its structure. If the current submarines are applied to atomic warfare, they obviously cannot be competent. In fact, until the last few months of the Second World War, the submarines of various countries in the world were not ships under water, but ships on the water, because they lurked underwater for a very short time, and most of the time they were still on the surface of the water for reconnaissance, or occasionally engaged in combat for a while. When submarines travel on the surface of the water, they are powered by internal combustion engines, but once they sink to the surface of the water, the internal combustion engines must stop working due to lack of air, and the power is entirely supplied by storage batteries, which is not only short in time, but also greatly restricted in speed. For example, the maximum speed of American standard submarines in water is only eight knots per hour. If it travels at two knots per hour, it can lie dormant for about forty hours. If it does not move at the bottom of the sea, it can last for sixty hours, but this is not combat, but hiding.

But in the "Navy of Tomorrow," the importance of the position occupied by submarines has generally become a conclusion.

### How to Defend Against Atomic Bombs? Not Fighting Anymore is the Smartest Way

— Translated by Junmo from "One World" Magazine

Do we have any way to defend against the terrible atomic bomb? First, we might think: Is it possible to find a way to detonate the atomic bomb at a very high altitude, so that the ground will not suffer damage? The atomic bombs dropped over Japan exploded in the air about 1,500 feet above the ground. The bomb is either equipped with a barometer fuse device, which makes it detonate automatically at a certain height, or it uses a radar meter, which emits radio waves and controls a certain time by reflecting the waves from the ground or the sea surface. When the bomb is at a very high altitude, where our measuring instruments cannot reach, we are certainly helpless. If it has reached a considerable height and it uses a radar meter, then we may be able to find a way to use radio waves to make it detonate early. But even if this is successful, the detonation of the bomb will still cause damage to the ground. Moreover, if it uses a barometer meter instead of a radar meter, then we are simply helpless.

We have almost no practical and effective way to deal with the atomic bomb that is already approaching. The missiles used by the Germans to attack England before the end of the European war are an example.

In July 1944, when missiles began to attack England, 35 percent of them reached London. In the end, only 9 percent could slip through the net, but that 9 percent was already overwhelming for the British.

Since there is nothing we can do about the atomic bomb itself, we can only try to deal with enemy planes carrying atomic bombs, hoping to destroy them at a very distant location so as not to affect important urban targets. In terms of reconnaissance, the current application of radar can detect a bomber within 200 miles and below 40,000 feet in any weather. But to do this, taking the United States as an example, at least 50,000 people in the country must be responsible for radar reconnaissance to be of any use, and this reconnaissance must be continuous 24 hours a day, every minute and every second. Month after month, year after year, can a country's finances afford to maintain such a huge amount of talent and financial resources to do this work? For the defenders, every minute and every small place cannot be relaxed, but the attackers can randomly choose that day, that place becomes.

Even if we know that enemy planes are coming from 100 or 200 miles away, what can we do to shoot them down one by one? Anti-aircraft guns and fighter planes have proven to be old-fashioned and useless in this war. Future aircraft must be unmanned aircraft controlled by radio, and their speed is so high that no manned fighter plane can catch up. Due to the high speed, it is also extremely difficult to hit them with anti-aircraft shells. The only way we can think of is to invent a very high-speed firing projectile, controlled by radar, so that it can automatically and accurately fly towards the aircraft and destroy it. In fact, this method is probably already under research by scientists.

But even if this invention is successful, how can we be sure to shoot down all the attacking enemy planes in one fell swoop, without missing a single one? Modern warfare is completely unexpected, and the number is so large and the scale is so large that you cannot prevent a few from slipping through the net. And just a few, just once, is already a decisive destruction.

Unless mankind can be smart and never go to war again. Otherwise, mankind can be said to be completely helpless against this terrible atomic bomb.

### Atomic Bombs in Rockets

According to the general opinion in the United States, the most important weapons in the future if war breaks out are atomic bombs and rockets. There is no need to elaborate on the power of atomic bombs. As for rockets, it is said that their speed can be increased to 22,800 miles per hour in the future. Even the most conservative estimate says that it can reach 5,000 miles per hour. More importantly, it can hit a predetermined target, and even if it occasionally misses, the difference will not exceed half a mile. If atomic bombs are loaded into these rockets and launched in groups from one country to another, from one continent to another, then in an instant, prosperous cities and simple villages will be in danger of being reduced to ashes.

### Foresight

American chemical engineer D埃卡德 was a very remarkable prophet. In 1941, he predicted that atomic bombs would appear in World War II, and that the war would soon be declared over once this weapon was used. Judging from the facts, it is absolutely correct!

Admiral Nimitz: After Nagasaki was struck by an atomic bomb, there was nothing left, like a desert.

### A Brief Discussion of Chinese Female Novelists

— Zhao Jingshen

It has been half a year since I returned to Shanghai on November 1st of last year. I always feel that the two years in Lihuang were more leisurely. The past six months of life in Shanghai have been particularly busy, and chaotic, something I have not experienced in the past ten years or so. I really want to "steal half a day of leisure" to appreciate literary works, but in fact, I have never been able to do so. I especially cherish the books and publications that my friends send me, and I have arranged a bookcase specifically for these books and publications. I value friends in the literary and art world more than all officials and dignitaries, and I always carefully read their works as a kind of pleasure. But since I can't find time, I have to steal time from my busy schedule and use the time on the tram or at banquets to read them. Reading books like this, my mind cannot calm down, and the difference in the degree of perception is self-evident.

Under such circumstances, I finished reading Ms. Luo Hong's two collections of short stories: "Ghost Shadow" and "This Era".

After a quick look, I have this impression: In the past, the novels written by modern female novelists were all lyrical, showing that they are women, and the scope of their descriptions was limited to the small circle in which they lived. But Luo Hong is realistic. If we don't look at the author's name, we can hardly know that the author is a woman. The scope of her descriptions is broad, and many things are beyond her own small circle. I have read too few creations, and it is easy to fall into mistakes if I make generalizations and judgments. If you allow me to say a conjecture, then within the scope of my reading, the female novelists of the past could only be said to be poets, and Ms. Luo Hong is the real novelist.

Bing Xin is a poet and novelist. Her "Smile" is really just prose poetry. Almost every one of her novels has a Bing Xin in it. Love for the sea, love for mothers, love for children, is full of lyrical tones. Lu Yin's "Old Friends by the Sea" is probably a portrayal of her own past life. Ling Shuhua's "Xiao Liang'er Lian" has infiltrated her own emotions and preferences. Lü Yi's "Thorns" can be said to be her autobiography. Even Ding Ling's early works, the scope of description seems to be limited to intellectuals. Chen Xue Zhao's "Tired Journey" is also lyrical. In short, although their works each have their own style and characteristics, they still show that they are women's works, making readers see the brand clearly. But Luo Hong is different. Except for occasionally seeing some delicate descriptions, if you cover up the author's name, it is almost difficult to guess that this is a female writer's work—especially when compared with Bing Xin and Ling Shuhua.

Before Luo Hong, has there ever been a female writer who wrote novels with such broad knowledge as "Twenty Years of Strange Phenomena"? Maybe there are, even many, but unfortunately, I repeat, I have too little time to read books. I haven't even read Shen Ying's and Feng Zi's novels yet, and I haven't read many of Bing Ying's and Bai Lang's novels either. There are also some female novelists whose names I can't name for a while.

Luo Hong writes novels, it seems, starting from restraint to free and easy, from meticulous brushwork to freehand brushwork, from piling up to plain description. To be honest, there was a short period of time when I didn't like her novels, that is, those that were restrained, meticulous, and piled up. However, restraint, meticulous brushwork, and piling up should be her solid foundation for writing novels. It is better to be liberated from restraint to free and easy, from meticulous brushwork to freehand brushwork, and from piling up to plain description, than to be free and easy from the beginning to the point of being uncontrollable, freehand to the point of being unable to control the meaning, and plain description to the point of being insufficient in strength, right? It's strange to say, especially "Ghost Shadow" and "This Era," which are the titles of these two books, I don't like. "Ghost Shadow" is too complicated. When I was a child, I watched "Eastern Zhou Kingdoms", and I couldn't feel like reading it even after watching it several times. After a while, I watched it again, but I still couldn't watch it. "This Era" is also written too heavily, not lively, and does not give readers a clear impression. I hope the author uses these two novels as the titles of the books just because they can be used as book titles, not because they particularly like these two.

There are several touching stories of the War of Resistance in the collection, but I especially appreciate those that depict human relationships and worldly affairs. For example: "Trampled Joy" in the Ghost Shadow Collection, and "Friendship", "Wang Boyan and Li Siye", and "Neighbors" in the This Era Collection.

I hope the author will be a "female Wu Woyao", a "Chinese Balzac", and continue to work hard in the aspect of social novels!

### Eloquence

— Zhang Baihuai

If there were no debates among people,

And we allowed deceitful hypocrites to control complex language,

The soul of true beauty

Would be destroyed by the venomous arrows of ugliness....

In a dark and deep sea of night....

A dream, carrying a gray, immense shadow, fiercely invaded the pillow of a stubborn young man.

"Impudent one!" It sternly spat out intimidating flames, and said in a rude, savage voice, "If you continue to be stingy with the conscience of your life, from now on, I will completely deprive you of all your beauty?"

The young man maintained his peaceful composure, replacing trembling, guilty answers with steady, measured breaths, and the sounds of thoughtful consideration.

"Humph! I question you!" The immense shadow roared urgently, and waving its coarse, shaggy hand, declared with absolute authority, "On the treasure island under my jurisdiction, exhibiting the wealth of human destiny, why do you dare to be so presumptuous, rolling your eyes in contempt, and secretly cursing my majesty with cold laughter?"

Like casting a huge rock into a waveless pond, the young man's heart stirred up high-splashing water; however, he was not at all afraid, and said calmly:

"You... but, who are you?—A terrible devil!" he thought to himself.

"Me?" The immense shadow did not intensify its fury; uneasy swaying revealed fierce contemplation. In an instant, as if a liar breaking free from interrogation loopholes, it solemnly and proudly introduced its task: "Me? I am the giver of your humanity's hellish happiness; as long as anyone is willing to follow the direction of my will, then no matter what difficult or impoverished situation they are in, they can obtain supreme joy and satisfaction! So—" it hesitated slightly, pausing: "Your conscience should be dedicated to me!"

As if raising his keen alertness, a chilling gust of wind blew on the young man's cheeks—

"Haha, how is that possible?" He showed a very distrustful look. "Conscience is the value of my life's existence, and you, strange theory, unbelievable! Since you say you are the giver of happiness to us humans, why do you inflict jealousy and harm upon my innate goodness?" As he spoke, he seemed not to be standing in this narrow, dark room, but rather standing in the open field of truth of his daily work.

"Hmph! You actually dare to resist me! You ignorant, stubborn fool! I tell you, your ideals are all absurd, and will only bring you frustration and resentment!" The immense shadow quickly revealed its original ferocity.

And the young man, he could not endure it anymore!

"What? You monster who insults pure and good humanity!" He clenched his fist, wanting to jump up. "I know you are merely trying to maintain false beliefs and status by taking advantage of people's ignorance and greed! You..." Ah, what is this?...... In an instant, his nerves fell into the emptiness of disillusionment, realizing how ridiculous and illusory the realm from which he came was.

The young man sat up with all his strength—

"Alas, nightmare, unanswerable nightmare!" he muttered to himself, throwing the sign of interrogation toward the night sky, where dark clouds pressed low outside the window.

"What did you do in your dream? Isn't it?..." A person's question, vague, uneasy, and with a hint of ridicule.

"I had a torrent of eloquence that did not satisfy me," was the young man's answering voice.

"Eloquence? You said... about what?"

An intellectual storm from who knows where, the floodgates of language between them, and so, in this silent night, by seepage, burst, and overflowed.

First, the young man sitting in the regret of the dream said:

"Please use the full power of your views to bombard the castle of my beliefs! I say, there is more hatred than love in the world."

"What do you hate?"

"I hate the filth in the hearts of mankind; they always regard themselves as supremely honorable, while others exist only for their happiness. I don't know why this heart is marked with so many traces of misfortune; it either reveals how selfish people bestow harm on those who are different from them, or it is indignant at those darlings of fate, using despicable means to escape the death penalty they deserve; it either records how those obsessed with profit and position conceal their unforgivable shallowness, or it hates the madness of those greedy ambitionists...". The young man's painful tone contained too much anger.

"But—alas, calm down, were you taken to an abyss of ugliness and cursing by the demon in your dream?..." The person speaking raised a hand that resembled a weeping gesture, unsure whether it was expressing sympathetic weakness.

The young man said affirmatively: "You have lost too much to age; I see you approaching the compromising road of humanity's trap day by day..."

"But, don't forget the world we move in; it hasn't left a single gap for your youth..."

"You've made a big mistake!" The young man jumped out of bed.

The greasy lamplight illuminated the dimness of the room; the young man's fervent thoughts were like a healthy child, gazing at the vast and boundless sea of life—

"Listen:" He seemed to be flipping open a page of colorful legend, or telling a fresh story to a child who loves imagination, his glittering pupils floating with the dreamy smile of wisdom. "It is not that I am disappointed in the laughter of the world, but that its moral decay has damaged its own dignity; do not think that I no longer have any hope for the world, because this heart is not only for my own happiness. Love is not only not my enemy, but also the banner of my life. If it is said that indifference to the vanity of the world is all garbage, then those who only seek personal enjoyment are even more pitiable!

"Ah, I am saying that the vicissitudes of the world will turn your black hair white..."

"Those who love truth are forever young for the sake of work!"

When the argument subsided, the crowing birds outside the window were beginning to sing, and the train of dawn had already brought a new day....

Lychee

As I hurriedly walked down the stone steps, a color that was very familiar to me beckoned in front, tempting me to approach it.

You say, what color is that?

This reminds me of the years of war, for a long period of time in the past I had never seen this color: the crimson fruit shells containing the juicy, white-fleshed fruit. Now that I am freed from the dust of war and revisiting the old dreams of my childhood, the color of these lychees is just like the fiery passion of the daughters of the South, (it beckons me, familiar and yet unfamiliar.) Can it rekindle the love that has long been extinguished in me?

Ah, lychee, such a beautiful name, a honey-like name!

A ray of sunlight filters down from the parasol tree, shimmering on the lychee stall: some lychees are receiving the kisses of the sun, while others sob in the dark corners where the sunlight cannot reach.

Ah! Daughters of the South, with years of war, you are perhaps just like the lychees I see in this city, some basking in the dazzling flames of war, and others weeping in the wind and darkness!

Today, in the first summer of peaceful times, the lychees still bloom and bear fruit, the tender, honey-like juice moisturizing the hearts of young children. Lychees, your vibrant colors call to me, I wish you well!

Beloved, renew us; when will our lives bloom?

Cage

It was the time of day when bamboo cages were being sold in the market, imprisoning the small lives of dusk. With a child's innocence, I bought one for them, a cage to imprison small lives. That kind of small life, in my hometown, we call him: "Call Brother," the sound of calling is not exactly a beautiful melody, but it can still please the children, so he becomes the children's little toy to play with carefully on the mat, generation after generation.

We humans are intelligent, but we have even greater flaws, seeing the imprisonment and killing of other small lives, often feeling a kind of satisfying joy. But, please, intelligent people, think about it, what about ourselves, what kind of cage is imprisoning our youth, (how would children think of these things?)

People are just like this, deceiving themselves and satisfying themselves, that's how they survive.

And so, between people, there is also distance. An irreparable distance, because there is so much mutual deception and beautiful lies in the world.

So, is that how people live such a pathetic life?

Intelligent people, I think you are able to give yourselves satisfactory answers.

Break free from the gate of this cage! (Three Five, Six, Twenty)

### Early Summer Vignette

— Ming

Early summer, ah! I gaze longingly at the green fields.

You wouldn't think that here, looking out the window, there is a mottled and filthy wilderness. Before my eyes, I have lost that vast green grassland; to the east, only a few sparse branches of parasol trees extend, too little green, summoning green memories, chasing after me all day long. And I have ultimately lost you, without a word, a gesture, a glance, indifferent and resolute. And so, there is no resentment, only a number of memories, wistfully following the season of summer!

There are no too hot days in Jiangnan; can the summer of the mountain city remain in your memory? The sunlight of early morning comes in from outside the door, a little bit of lonely excess heat. Too far away, ah! That green field, where so many life memories were spent! I silently recite two lines: "Treating wealth as peasants treat scholars, reading numbers with concern for the Way, not poverty," these were the lines of poetry that longed for friendship. I met you in that green field.

There, we once wore grass-green clothes together. Every day, in the faint light of dawn, with a fervent young heart, we watched the rising of the national flag of our motherland. On the grave mounds of the wilderness, we looked at the moon and counted the stars together. We praised Zhuangzi's life and recited Li Houzhu's verses. These are all recent memories, but now they are lost in the distant mountain city, in lonely Jiangnan, you no longer remember; "The small building again feels the east wind last night, in the moonlit night I cannot bear to look back at my lost country." Those hard but happy days!

You no longer need the memories of the past; you are clever and happy; you have read Zhuangzi. That kind of green trees and red buildings, leisurely and elegant life, makes you tired of forgetting those arduous and dark days. We are people living in two different circumstances, nurturing two different lives. Although we once shared a certain point of resonance with each other, you ultimately left me!

I can't forget falling down in the darkness and chaos, falling in the light and chaos, although I struggled through the darkness, and did not fall in the light and chaos, and even returned to this Jiangnan; but I am gasping for breath, faltering on the path of life. During this time, I longed to get some warmth of life from you, so that life could have some basis for existence, and perhaps walk more firmly. But you, you ultimately left, like someone accustomed to the stimulation of coffee and wine, after drinking a cup of the wine needed, without any drunkenness, any lingering affection, pushing the cup away and leaving. So calm and straightforward.

You said that in order to cherish another emotion, you had to forget the green memories. How do you distinguish for yourself your virtue and emotions? I have been gnawing at myself with this pain, but this has made me understand some of the meanings of life even more, and memory will make my faltering steps more firm on the path of life, and I will no longer hope for the illusions of mountain forests and springs.

I mistakenly received a cup of strong coffee from your hand, and ignored another cup of clear water necessary on the path of life. I originally wanted clear water, but drank the wrong coffee. For someone not accustomed to bitterness and sweetness, it will be a bitter aftertaste.

I remember you told me that Jesus said: "It is happiness to forgive others," I hope I can always remember this sentence.

After all, we once intertwined our lives, although it was such a short period of time, in the long string of hard days, you also shared some faint happiness for me, which will live forever in eternal memory.

The road of life is so long! But life is so short. When one day you feel the need for clear water on the road of life, I am willing to sincerely store a cup of pure clear water for you.

Let us forget the unpleasant and unbeautiful! 1945, 6, 12

### Birds of a Feather (65)

— Zhao Qingge

For the children's first stage appearance, Mrs. Mo absolutely could not allow them to show a shabby appearance, so she specially ordered several sets of "gear" (i.e., stage costumes) for Lihua and Liyun. She also ordered two sets of "headdress" (i.e., head ornaments) for Lihua. This was another unavoidable expense. Investing the capital to seek profit, Mrs. Mo was willing! She calculated that she would earn countless interest beyond these capitals.

On the evening of New Year's Eve, Mrs. Mo was very happy. She prepared a lot of wine and dishes to entertain Shi Yulou, Second Mrs. Weng, Zhang Xian, etc. She also gave Lihua and Liyun each a silver dollar from Old Yuan's head as New Year's money. Shi Yulou, Second Mrs. Weng, and Zhang Xian also each gave a silver dollar. Liyun was so happy that she jumped up and down, while Lihua remained calm and composed.

"Xiaohua, Xiaoyun, tomorrow is the day of your first stage appearance, you must earn some face for your master! If you sing badly, your master will beat you." Mrs. Mo said to the two little sisters with a smile.

Lihua and Liyun didn't say anything. They were each thinking about their own things.

"They won't sing badly! See whose disciples they are? The peaches and plums in front of my Zhang Xian's door, none of them fail to blossom." Zhang said, blowing his own horn, and then winking at Lihua with a slanted eye.

"Don't brag, maybe tomorrow the two children will go on stage and not open their mouths, at that time be careful to snap your strings." Second Mrs. Weng said jokingly.

"Don't worry, Sister Shi! I guarantee it. Oh, did you see? At the entrance of the theater, I posted a big poster, which says: 'Sister Flowers Mo Lihua Mo Liyun Grand Debut on New Year's Day.' Many people paid attention, hehe, if it sells out tomorrow, two-thirds is due to your Shi Yulou's appeal, and one-third must be attributed to our pair of sister flowers!" Zhang Xian boasted triumphantly, as if boasting about his own glorious achievements.

"Really, I specially went to see it with my sister today, and the entrance of the theater was crowded with people." Mrs. Mo said with a smile. She and Zhang Xian felt the same glory.

"Alas! It looks like three of our family are going to eat 'opening rice' (meaning to make a living by singing!)" Shi Yulou said with emotion, looking somewhat sad.

"What's wrong with eating 'opening rice'? If they become 'headliner' (the leading performer in a troupe) like you in the future, that's something to be proud of!" Zhang Xian said. He shrugged his hooked nose quite disapprovingly.

"What's so 'proud' about being a 'headliner'? Sooner or later, you are providing entertainment for others! You can't even rest for a while during the New Year." Shi Yulou couldn't help but retort to Zhang Xian in annoyance, yawning as he walked out. He turned back and shouted: "It's time to go to the theater, my master Qin Shi!"

Zhang Xian responded. He winked flirtatiously at Second Mrs. Weng, mumbling:

This is called eating a line and complaining about a line!

Second Mrs. Weng gave a bitter smile. At this time, her heart was more uncomfortable than Shi Yulou's. She understood that Shi Yulou's grumbling was sincere, because Shi Yulou's body had been very bad recently. Although opium was giving him energy, he could barely sing a few sentences, but his voice was already much worse. But the burden of life made him unable to not sing. He can still sing now, but what will happen in two years when he can't sing? So he is annoyed! He resents this line! Second Mrs. Weng loves him. She pities him, but she is powerless to help him. For this reason, she often sheds tears in secret recently.
