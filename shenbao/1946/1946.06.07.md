### Memorial Week Report by Chief of General Staff Chen

(5) Military Demobilization This time, the cadres to be demobilized from various levels of troops number approximately two hundred thousand. They are all veterans of the Anti-Japanese War, and the government should make proper arrangements for them. However, some people who do not know the truth believe that the government's implementation of military demobilization has not yet seen a single person return to the fields. It must be understood that China's situation is different from that of Europe and the United States, and it cannot be simply completed with a demobilization order. If officers and soldiers cannot live in peace after retirement, they will not understand the country's intention to reward merit, and it will also affect social order. The Military Affairs Commission originally stipulated: (1) Individual Transition: Demobilized officers are first incorporated into the Officers' Corps. In addition to retirement and dismissal, it is planned to provide specialized training to 150,000 people and then assign them to police, transportation, management, industry and mining, agriculture and forestry, animal husbandry, land administration, local administration, local health, finance, compulsory education, social labor, and other departments. Various training programs will begin separately from June. (2) Group Transition: Mainly for demobilized soldiers. In addition to retirement and dismissal, it is estimated that approximately one million people will be organized into construction corps for railways, highways, water conservancy projects, agriculture and forestry, reclamation, and mining, according to their wishes. After the completion of the project, they will be transferred to road workers, mine police, or allocated land according to the number of people. (3) Advanced Studies: Select outstanding demobilized officers and soldiers and provide them with military technical training for use in troop cadre exchanges and replacements during force reductions. (4) Among the retired and demobilized officers and soldiers, those who volunteer or whose age and physique meet the retirement and dismissal requirements, it is estimated that there are approximately 40,000 officers and 400,000 soldiers, who will be given various retirement (5) dismissal allowances and travel expenses, etc. (The above four measures have been implemented in stages). (5) Dismissal of Military and Civilian Personnel: Those who retire can be dismissed by analogy to the rank of officer, and a one-time retirement payment and travel expenses to return to their hometown will be issued according to the regulations for one-time retirement. It is planned to dismiss 30,000 military personnel this year, including 120 generals, 3,845 colonels, and 26,053 lieutenants. Regarding the demobilization of the Youth Army, the student soldiers who served in the Youth Army and other troops (Military Police, Motorized Regiments, Assault Brigades, Automotive Technology Training Classes), except for the troops stationed in the occupied areas and other important tasks, will be demobilized by the end of May this year. Those who pass the graduation examination of the Reserve Officer Education will be awarded the rank of Second Lieutenant in the Army Corps or Specialty. Those who fail will be awarded the rank of Reserve Sergeant and then demobilized (they are also allowed to stay in the camp according to their wishes). (6) Establish various military systems and strive for scientific research and development. The various military systems in the plan, and the key ones, are approximately the following: First, adopt the military region system, planning to divide the country into several military regions, each responsible for the implementation of military affairs. Second, reform and establish the military education system, so that the training of army, navy, and air force cadres and commanders is achieved under a hard-won and reasonable procedure and sound cultivation, so as to achieve the goal of assigning positions according to ability and awarding ranks according to performance. Third, the regulations for supply areas, adopting a warehouse system to facilitate in-kind supply, dividing the country into several supply areas. Fourth, the determination of organization. China's production is backward, which leads to organizational aspects often accommodating reality, and taking small steps. In the future, we should take the strengths of others, and not stop reforming. A plan has been drawn up and will be further studied in order to improve it. Fifth, implement a universal military training system, and strive to improve and promote it. As for scientific research and development, since modern national defense is the integration of all sciences, the most important thing to talk about national defense and military building is the research and development of national defense science. However, the congenital foundation of national defense science construction depends on the universal development of pure science and applied science in society before it can be expected to be successful. It is hoped that the whole country will work together to catch up with the world's most advanced standards. Finally, it should be specifically mentioned that this time, China's reform of the military system is very arduous. In addition to relying on the chairman to preside over it, and receiving guidance from the former Chief of Staff and Minister Bai, General Wedemeyer also made several earnest suggestions to the chairman before his visit to China. At the same time, the valuable opinions of Brigadier General Brink and his staff were also received, so that China's current Ministry of National Defense can be established as it is. This kind of priceless friendship is deeply appreciated here. (End of yesterday's first edition)

Editorial

### Don't Miss the Opportunity Again!

The ceasefire order in the Northeast, which Chinese and foreign people have long awaited, was issued yesterday. Starting from noon today, negotiations to resolve pending issues must be concluded within fifteen days. This is Chairman Chiang's wise decision, a patriotic and people-loving decision, especially a decision to protect the Chinese Communist Party and give it another opportunity to fulfill the agreement.

For the sake of the Chinese people, naturally, we earnestly hope that the Communist Party will not miss this opportunity again. Even for the sake of the Communist Party itself, to show that their party members still have a genuine concept of loving the motherland, it is best not to miss this opportunity again.

(1) Complete cessation of conflicts in the Northeast, (2) Complete restoration of domestic transportation, (3) Prompt implementation of the agreement on army demobilization, reorganization, and unified compilation – these three items are major events that the entire nation unanimously hopes to resolve urgently. Now that there is a fifteen-day negotiation opportunity, we hope that everyone will prioritize the country and the people, and cherish these fifteen days twelve thousand times, cherish every hour, every minute, every second within these fifteen days, never let it pass by fruitlessly, never let it be perfunctory, and in the end, it's still empty talk, equivalent to not talking.

Mr. Zhou Enlai said, "These fifteen days are a suspension of fighting, not a ceasefire." Whether it's a suspension of fighting or a ceasefire, our common people only ask that everyone bring sincere good intentions, say one thing and mean it, say one thing and do it. Only in this way can we truly not miss the opportunity again. "A man's word is his bond." With "trust," then people can negotiate with each other, and parties can negotiate with each other. We earnestly hope that any political party, especially the Chinese Communist Party, will use "trust" to guarantee that this opportunity for peaceful negotiations will not be missed again. The overall situation in China will absolutely not allow any political party to drag it on with any excuses. Dragging it on further will be a dead end, a road to ruin! If they still intend to miss this opportunity, so that China cannot obtain a peaceful and tranquil situation, then they are definitely not Chinese statesmen but Chinese criminals!

Opening of the UNRRA Far East Conference

The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) Far East Conference opens today in our nation's capital. Representatives from nine countries – England, the United States, France, the Soviet Union, Australia, India, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and the Philippines – after being accompanied by representatives from our government to inspect the famine situation in various disaster areas of our country, have already arrived in Nanjing to attend the conference. The main task of this conference is certainly to review work and strengthen the relief organization in the Far East, but in our opinion, the most urgent task is how to redistribute food to relieve the 30 million hungry people in China, so that they do not all become starving corpses.

China's war of resistance lasted the longest, the war extended throughout the country, and the losses were naturally the greatest. The rural areas in the occupied territories were exploited and devastated by the enemy and puppets for eight or nine years. In the rural areas of the Great Rear Area, due to supporting the nation's war of resistance and providing vast manpower and military rations, the desolate scene of abandoned fields is also readily apparent. Today's 30 million war refugees, reduced to hungry people crying for food, are entirely the result of the war of resistance. It is the duty of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to make every effort to provide relief. Former UNRRA Director Lehman once cabled Chairman Chiang of our country, saying: "The heroic resistance of your country's people against the common enemy of the United Nations, enduring such long years of hardship, will forever be admired by peace-loving people all over the world, and no people are more deserving of UNRRA assistance than the people of your country." Because of this, our country's current request to UNRRA for emergency relief is justified and deserved.

In January of this year, at the United Nations General Assembly in London, discussing the world food shortage, our country's representative, Ambassador Gu Weijun, requested that UNRRA provide one million tons of rice in 1946. In principle, this was agreed to by various countries, but in reality, in the first quarter of this year, China only received 18,000 tons of rice. In the second quarter, UNRRA planned to allocate 120,000 tons of rice to China, which was later reduced to 100,000 tons, which is too far from what we actually need. A drop in the bucket, what good does it do? Moreover, UNRRA's allocation of food is quite unfair. Our country's representative, Director Chiang Tingfu, argued on the basis of reason at the UNRRA conference, and pointed out that the UNRRA Food Bureau's allocation was unfair. China was only allocated 18,000 tons in the first quarter of this year, while Malaya received 58,000 tons, and the Dutch East Indies also received 55,000 tons, three times as much as China. With such unfair allocation, we don't know how the UNRRA organizers assess China's war of resistance. Later, Mr. Hoover, Chairman of the U.S. Relief Committee, came to China to investigate the famine, and our government and the public formally requested him to provide 200,000 tons of food per month from May to August of this year. After Mr. Hoover personally inspected the disaster areas and determined that the disaster situation was indeed serious, he expressed acceptance of our country's request to supply 200,000 tons of rice. Therefore, the problem now is how to make Hoover's promise a reality through UNRRA. Mr. Hoover said to us in Shanghai: "During this critical period from May to September, we must fully utilize the effectiveness of various transportation methods to distribute 200,000 tons of food to various places every month to relieve the famine." We also have no excessive expectations for the opening of this UNRRA Far East Conference, as long as Hoover's plan can be realized first, otherwise, nothing else can be discussed. Because the period from May to September is the time when our country has a gap between the old and new harvests, and food is most difficult to obtain. After the national autumn harvest, the famine situation will naturally ease slightly.

President Truman once appealed for the hungry people of the world, saying: "We cannot achieve peace and prosperity when famine, disease, and poverty make it impossible for people to survive." We hope that the representatives of various countries attending the Far East Conference will not forget President Truman's famous saying, and especially must know that the current situation in the Far East, whether in India or Korea, especially in our country, the severity of the food shortage is even greater than in Europe. The famine situation in Hunan Province can truly be described as horrific! However, at a time of such disaster in China, overseas Chinese in Siam are willing to save rice by economizing on food to transport it to their compatriots in the motherland, but they are still being blocked by the British, restricted by UNRRA's failure to issue export licenses for transporting grain, making Siamese rice seem so close yet unattainable to Chinese disaster victims. What justice is this based on! If the Chinese authorities remain silent at the UNRRA Far East Conference, they should be condemned by our people.

Finally, we cannot help but regret the current methods of UNRRA's food allocation. Food allocation should take "actual need" as the highest standard, otherwise it will be unfair and will lose the original intention of relieving famine. Recently, foreign newspapers and magazines have widely reported that "UNRRA's wheat is often sold on the black market in the South; and in the Soviet Union, UNRRA's food is stored for future use by the Soviet army." Whether these are rumors, UNRRA needs to send personnel to investigate. Drawing inferences from one instance, we also firmly advocate finding a reasonable and appropriate solution to the problem of UNRRA's food allocation in the Far East.

### After Referendum Rejects Monarchy, Italian Royal Family Prepares to Flee, Umberto Flies to Naples with Queen

"Agence France-Presse, Naples, Italy, 5th" After the Italian referendum rejected the monarchy, King Umberto II is preparing to abdicate. Queen Marie-José and her four children arrived here by plane from Rome today and drove to Mariabye for a temporary stay. Two cruisers are currently docked in this port, but there is no sign of hasty preparations to escort the royal family out of the country. It is unknown where the royal family will flee, but it is generally believed that the Queen and her children intend to go to Egypt, while Umberto intends to go to Switzerland.

Prime Minister De Gasperi made a broadcast to the nation this evening, asking the people to respect the results of the referendum and saying that Italy should remain united and oppose any actions that hinder the country from participating in the construction of a new world.

[Reuters, London, 5th] A Foreign Office spokesman said that the Allied authorities will not interfere in the outcome of the Italian referendum on the form of government.

[Reuters, London, 5th] Rome Radio officially announced tonight the results of the election to determine the form of government in Italy: 12,182,855 votes in favor of a republican form of government, and 10,362,709 votes in favor of a monarchical form of government.

[Another dispatch] The Italian Ministry of the Interior announced the election results this afternoon: in 34,046 districts calculated out of 35,236 districts, the Christian Democratic Party received 7,866,864 votes, the Socialist Party received 4,606,509 votes, and the Communist Party received 4,004,741 votes.

The History of the Savoy Royal Family's Rule of Italy [Reuters, London, 5th] After the Italian people voted against the monarchy, the Savoy Royal Family, which ruled Italy, became a relic of history. Umberto II, the last to be called Emperor, ascended the throne after the abdication of Emmanuel III and lost his title of "Lord of All People" after only a few weeks in power. The Savoy Royal Family's rule of Italy began in 1861, when Emmanuel II was declared King of Turin by the first Italian Parliament, but the history of the royal family dates back to the 11th century, when their ancestor, Berthold, had already settled on the western slopes of the Alps. Emmanuel II was the fifth of Italy, and several of them were unfortunate. Umberto I was assassinated in 1900, and Emmanuel III succeeded him. In 1922, Mussolini marched on Rome but did not issue a martial law order, thereby incurring the disgrace of "opening the door to welcome Fascism." He abdicated on May 9th and, after fleeing to Egypt, has become a forgotten figure. Although Umberto II succeeded to the throne and harbored ambitions, he was out of touch with the times and was not welcomed by the public. During his reign, he stayed in the palace and routinely met with the Prime Minister once a week to sign orders, but he was ultimately rejected by the people's vote.

Yugoslavia replied that due to the attitude taken by Britain towards Yugoslavia, the Yugoslav government would confuse and perplex the people if it sent troops to participate in the London parade.

### Japanese Judo Experts Lament the Exhaustion of Their Skills: How Can There Be a Wonderful Performance on an Empty Stomach?

[United Press Tokyo, 6th] The Kyoto News Agency observed the future of Japanese sumo wrestling (i.e., "Oshikaku") today and believes that this sport is nearing its end. This is because sumo wrestlers are larger and heavier than ordinary Japanese people, and due to the current food shortage, they cannot use their bellies to collide and perform the wonderful performances of the days when they were well-fed. One of them said sadly, "How can we slam the door on an empty stomach?" Another said, "Eating only noodles is not enough to wrestle." A third sighed and said, "After a single match, we are too tired to get up." The Sumo Association recently concluded a five-day performance, with few spectators, and everyone agreed that the performance was unprecedentedly poor.

### One Voice in the British House of Commons, Churchill and Attlee Echoing Each Other, Denouncing the Soviet Union. Churchill: Please Do Not Provoke America, Dear Old Friend Stalin. Attlee: The Soviet People Seem to Live in a Dark Forest.

[United Press London, 5th] On the second day of the foreign policy debate in the House of Commons, Prime Minister Attlee and former Prime Minister Churchill put aside domestic disputes and unanimously made measured accusations against the Soviet Union (the main points of Churchill's speech, which this newspaper listened to on the London broadcast yesterday, have already been published). Churchill said in a calm tone, "From the Baltic Sea to the Adriatic Sea, not only has a heavy curtain fallen, but behind the curtain is a vast land whose population, excluding the Soviet Union, accounts for almost one-third of the entire population of Europe. The seeds of the Third World War are sown there." Attlee expressed his full support for Foreign Secretary Bevin's accusation yesterday that the Soviet Union was obstructing the path to peace, and said: The difficulty lies in the fact that the Soviet Union insists on strictly interpreting the Potsdam Agreement according to its literal meaning, without any flexibility. I believe that the Soviet Union's actions disregard the spirit in which we participated in the Potsdam Agreement. The Soviet Union seems unable to understand the political systems and political opposition of Western countries. This is the real iron curtain, that is, the iron curtain in the mind. But I do not believe that we should judge the current world situation with a completely pessimistic attitude. I believe that no one is more responsible for overcoming the current difficulties than Foreign Secretary Bevin.

Hope for the Soviet Union. Churchill expressed regret that the Soviet Union regarded any agreement between Britain and the United States as an anti-Soviet bloc. Attlee also said: "I completely agree that making friends with neighboring countries is not an act of organizing a bloc, but we also do not want to make friends with Western countries alone. What we want is to make friends with all countries in the world." Churchill then said: It is unbelievable that the small number of capable people who control the central hub of the Soviet Union are so isolated from Western democracy. It is not in the Soviet Union's interest to provoke the United States. No nation is slower to develop hostile feelings towards foreign countries than the American people. What we hope from the Soviet Union is goodwill. If the Soviet Union encounters trouble, Britain will naturally fulfill its obligations and come to the aid of the Soviet Union. However, Britain does not approve of the indefinite postponement of peace treaties, which leaves millions of people in a semi-human state between heaven and hell, which will only encourage moral corruption or even trigger an active war.

Unite the World. Churchill called on people to support the United Nations organization, saying that this world organization is our last hope. A united world is better than a fragmented world, but a fragmented world is slightly better than a destroyed world. But Attlee said: We do not want to be pessimistic, which would divide Europe into two major camps. We should cooperate most closely with all Western countries, such as Belgium, the Netherlands, the Scandinavian countries, and especially France. Germany should be regarded economically as a whole and indivisible. It is better to establish a federation politically. The country must be self-reliant, and we should continue to work to promote its economic unification and realize true democracy, which requires close cooperation with our great allies to complete.

The German Question. Churchill expressed dissatisfaction with the division of Germany into the Soviet-occupied zone and the Western-occupied zones, saying that the Soviet Union is doing its best to communize and Sovietize the entire occupied zone. Poland has lost all freedom to express its national will, and Austria and Hungary are suffocating under the heavy pressure of large numbers of Soviet troops. We should make peace with Germany, or only with any part of Germany that is still under our control. We should also make peace with Italy, which was our ally in the last two years of the war. If this kind of peace treaty cannot be achieved through negotiations between the United Nations, then I agree with Foreign Secretary Bevin's proposal to submit this matter to the United Nations organization, so that the twenty-one countries that actually fought the war can make the most effective resolution and promote its early realization.

Churchill's Witty Remarks. Attlee said: We hope that the Soviet people, as if they were living in a dark forest every day, do not know the sunshine, breeze, and air of freedom and democracy. Churchill said: The American eagle rests on its perch, this startled bird has long claws and a beak, glaring vigilantly, motionless, while Mr. Gromyko (the Soviet representative to the United Nations Security Council) uses a sharp sickle to provoke it day by day, sometimes touching its beak, sometimes touching its wings, sometimes touching its tail feathers. The United States has remained silent, but it would be a mistake to think that it will remain silent when its chest is touched. I dare to offer this friendly advice to my old comrade in arms, Marshal Stalin, more definitively. At this point in Churchill's speech, the entire audience burst into laughter.

The Spanish Question. Churchill and Attlee both spoke about the Spanish question. Churchill approved of Franco's policy of standing aside. Churchill said: The Franco government is "one of the least aggressive in the world. In fact, Spain under Franco's rule is more free than Poland at this time, and ordinary people also enjoy greater security and comfort." Attlee said: We must take the most careful action to overthrow the current government of Spain and replace it with a suitable government.

### The Shipping Industry Expresses Shock: British Merchants Attempt to Regain Navigation Rights Under the Guise of Relief, Urging the Government to Consider Carefully Opening Inland River Navigation Rights.

Yesterday's report stated that the Supreme National Defense Council passed the Executive Yuan's proposal to "open inland river navigation rights." This has a significant impact on the development of China's shipping industry. The reporter specifically visited Mr. Li Yunliang, Secretary-General of the Shanghai Shipping Industry Association. According to him, the shipping industry is extremely shocked by this measure by the government. Because British merchants, under the guise of transporting relief supplies, are attempting to regain their inland river navigation rights. The current lease of British ships will expire on the 15th of next month. The shipping industry has repeatedly appealed to the government. Now the government is going to open important ports such as Nanjing, Wuhu, Jiujiang, and Wuhan on the Yangtze River, and still allow foreign ships to dock. Those who do not understand the plight of the shipping industry may say that this will help with repatriation transportation. In fact, our existing commercial ships have reached 500,000 tons, which is the number before the war. Among them, the Yangtze River accounts for more than 200,000 tons, such as the Jiangshun, Jiang'an, Jianghua, Jiangxin, Jiangping, Jiangjing, etc. of the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and the Minquan, Minlian, Minyi, etc. of Minsheng Company, and the Changxing, Yongjia, etc. of Sanbei Company, and the Dada, Hongda, etc. of Dada Datong Company, totaling more than 150 ships. After the victory, most of them were engaged in transporting troops, prisoners of war, and repatriates without pay. Now the transportation of prisoners of war is about to be completed, and all ships can be responsible for repatriation and general cargo and passenger transportation. It is estimated that the carrying capacity can transport more than one million tons back and forth per month, based on an average of two and a half trips per month. And the export cargo from Nanjing, Wuhu, Jiujiang, and Wuhan is no more than 200,000 tons at most. Currently, it is extremely difficult for ships sailing down the Yangtze River to find cargo, and there are many return voyages with empty tons. The fundamental reason is that the economies of various regions have not yet returned to normal. Except for repatriation transportation in Chongqing, cargo and passengers on all routes are scarce, and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is about to have a large number of ships sailing, which will create a surplus. The government is urged to carefully consider opening inland river navigation rights, so as not to easily lose the navigation rights that were recently recovered, and to cause the shipping industry, which has just seen a glimmer of dawn, to collapse again.

Respect on behalf of the Pope

Mr. Tian did not speak at length due to excessive hardship during his return trip. However, the main purpose of his trip to Nanjing to meet with Chairman Jiang was to pay his respects to Chairman Jiang for his various instructions to Mr. Tian, and to pay his respects to the Chairman on behalf of the Pope, wishing China a bright future.

### The Trial of the Xue Monk Murder Case: Seven Criminals Have an Atrocious Attitude, Claiming to Be Falsely Accused with Sarcastic Words, Interrogation for Four Hours, The Court Ordered a Postponement

[This newspaper] At 2:00 p.m. yesterday, the Military Court of the First Pacification Zone brought to trial the Xue Monk case, in which a monk was tortured to death by the enemy's military police for rescuing a downed American pilot. The defendants, Kuboe Yasuharu, Kataoka Akira, Omori Mitsuo, Noma Sadaji, Morishita Munetaka, Hayahara Isao, and Setani Tsutao, were all former members of the Special High Police Unit of the enemy's Pudong Military Police.

After the court opened, the prosecutor first read the indictment, and the presiding judge questioned each defendant one by one. All of them categorically denied that they had ever tortured Xue's family or abused and killed the Xue monk. Then, the witness Xue Guanyuan stated that she was one of the perpetrators. Xue Quanyun also identified Noma. Xue Yatou pointed out Noma, Kataoka Akira, and Hayahara Isao, and Xue Jinxing said that the person who beat him was not among these seven people. When asked again, Noma and the other three still denied it, saying that the three of them were more famous in the team, so they were falsely accused. As for the investigation of the U.S. Air Force, it was carried out by the escaped captain Ono Shigeru, Hirata, and Benyama (also on the run). At this point, the prosecutor stood up and said that when Noma and Kataoka were extradited from the Japanese prisoner-of-war administration office, there were two people with each name, but the witness only identified the defendants in court now, which shows that it is definitely not a false accusation. As for the other defendants, who belonged to the Special High Police Unit, they were all related to this tragic case, and the court is requested to impose a sentence in accordance with the law. The presiding judge then asked each defendant what their opinions were, and Noma and others still denied it loudly. Especially Noma, Kataoka, and Hayahara Isao had an arrogant attitude and spoke sarcastically. Noma also demanded that Ono Shigeru and Hirata, who were on the run, be arrested and brought to justice to clarify the truth. The interrogation continued until 6:00 p.m., but there was still no result. The court ordered a postponement for further questioning.

### The First Batch of Evacuated German Nationals, More Than 1,000 People, Will Return to Their Country Within a Month

[This newspaper] According to the English-language Great American Evening Post, the list of the first batch of German nationals to be evacuated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, about 1,000 people, is expected to be transported back to their country by U.S. ships before the end of this month. It is reported that this batch of names includes not only German Nazis, but also non-Nazi German businessmen and technicians. Among these non-Nazis, there are many who have provided direct or indirect assistance to us during the War of Resistance. Moreover, in the regulations on the management of German nationals promulgated by the Executive Yuan, there were original provisions for applying for non-evacuation for German nationals with good conduct who have not acted against us. Therefore, the German nationals in this batch who believed that they met these provisions applied for non-evacuation several weeks ago. Now that the news of the evacuation has suddenly come out, the German nationals who applied for non-evacuation are all feeling extremely confused. The reason is that some of these German nationals have resided in our country for generations, and some have even applied to be naturalized as citizens of our country, and their original hometowns in their home country no longer have any houses or residences.

### British Tramcars Will Extend Their Operating Hours

### Strengthening Transportation Between Pudong and Puxi, Adding New Ferries, Planning Three-Story Cabins

[This newspaper] The municipal transportation of this city has expanded greatly, and the houses are lined up in rows. Even Pudong, which is closest to the bustling area, is separated by a river, and the construction situation is vastly different. The authorities are now gathering Chinese and foreign experts to design the city and jointly plan the implementation. It is heard that in addition to the original eight ferries that are still in operation, the city ferry company has recently expanded its business and added new ferries. The style has been drawn by experts. It is planned to be 120 feet long and 30 feet wide, divided into three floors. The top floor is the driver's room, the middle floor has ten car washes, and the lower floor can carry more than 400 passengers. There are automatic forward machines in the front and rear, which can move forward and backward freely, which is extremely convenient. Orders have been placed with the United Kingdom and the United States, and delivery can be made in six months. At the same time, ten UNRRA landing craft have arrived in Shanghai and may be used. Experts are currently inspecting them. According to the person in charge, developing Pudong is the most ideal, but convenient transportation should be planned first, so that people do not feel the hardship of crossing the river, and safety is guaranteed. Then the Public Works Bureau can find ways to open the Pudong trunk road, build civilian villages, etc. In less than three years, the results will be considerable. The most problematic thing now is the construction of docks on both sides of the river. It may be possible to use the Huishan Wharf in Hongkou and the wharf south of Roosevelt first, which are being inspected separately. As for the ferry company being changed to a joint government-business operation, it has been approved by the Municipal Council. According to rumors, two-thirds are business shares and one-third are government shares.

### U.S. Military Tribunal Tries Four Japanese War Criminals from Taiwan, Victims Personally Testify in Court

The U.S. War Crimes Tribunal yesterday tried Japanese war criminals Captain Nakano Yoshio, Kawai Seikai, Imura Shuichi, Private Seki Susumu, and others. They were accused of injuring and abusing U.S. Air Force Lieutenant Hart at a prisoner-of-war camp in Taiwan in 1945. Hart was lost in action last year and arrested by the Japanese in Taiwan. The defendants used various tortures to obtain information. However, Hart refused to divulge military secrets despite the various tortures he suffered, and was beaten until he was scarred all over. After the war ended in the fall, Hart was released and returned to the United States for recuperation. He was now ordered by the U.S. government to come to Shanghai to testify in court, personally describing the various crimes of the defendants, providing a lot of evidence to the court. The case is scheduled to continue hearing today.

More than 30 Japanese war criminals were transported from Shanghai to Hong Kong by British ships yesterday.

They were prosecuted according to the law. Yesterday morning, defendants Zhou Lianze and Yang Junlin, two lawyers, appeared in court to defend them, stating that they were natives of Wuxing, Zhejiang, 37 years old, and that their defection was due to the pressure of life, not a willing embrace of the enemy.

### Hai Min Ship Grounded; Towed to Hong Kong for Repairs

[Our Newspaper's Report] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Hai Min ship sailed from Shanghai to Shantou last month on the 14th and then went on to Xiamen. On the 17th, the ship left Xiamen and sailed to Shantou. On the morning of the 19th, the ship accidentally struck an obstacle in the sea near Shantou, causing a hole in the bow compartment. Seawater flooded in, creating an extremely dangerous situation. To avoid sinking, the ship's captain ordered full speed ahead, heading for the shallow beach near the shore, and the ship was grounded.

### Gunshots on Nanjing Road: Forgetful Doctor Causes Trouble in a Panic; Two People Injured, Large Sum Lost

[Our Newspaper's Report] Hu Shouren (39 years old), the chief doctor of the 23rd Division of the 85th Army stationed in Zhengzhou, was dispatched to Shanghai a week ago to purchase supplies. At 2:15 PM yesterday, Hu, carrying a comfort bag containing 5.4 million yuan in legal tender, was riding an eastbound trolley car. When the car arrived at the trolley station at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Shanxi Road, Hu intended to return to the China Underwear Company to shop. He got off the car in a hurry and forgot the comfort bag on the car. He realized it after walking a few steps and rushed back, urgently ordering the driver to open the car door. He jumped back on the car, but because there were too many passengers, the handgun he was holding accidentally discharged, injuring passenger Lin Guozhen (from Ningbo, 30 years old) in the liver. At the same time, another passenger, Zhao Bobin, was injured in the hand. When Hu saw that he had caused trouble, he ordered the driver to call the police. At that moment, an American Jeep car passed by. Hu asked the driver to take the injured to Renji Hospital for treatment. As for the lost comfort bag, passengers fled after the gunshot, causing chaos. The large sum of money has been lost. Afterwards, Hu was taken to the Laozha Police Station for questioning, and a strict investigation was launched to find the money.

### Fu Sinian Talks to Reporters: Restoring Peking University to its Former Glory, Seemingly Filled with Confidence; The May Fourth Movement of That Year Opposed the Traitorous Beiyang Government; Does the Current Student Movement Oppose the Government That Endured Eight Years of Resistance Against Japan?

[Special Dispatch from Our Beiping Correspondent] This morning, our reporter visited Fu Sinian, the president of Peking University. Mr. Fu's hair has already turned white, but his spirit is still as vigorous as ever. When talking about restoring "Peking University to its former glory," he seemed full of confidence. He holds somewhat disapproving views on the student movements that are surging across various regions. He said, "I will consider allowing students from Beiping Provisional University who enjoy causing trouble to transfer to Peking University." He also said, "The current government, though not entirely satisfactory, is, after all, the government that endured eight years of resistance against Japan. It is acceptable for students to make demands, but they should not overstep the boundaries. I will consider reasonable demands, but I will not listen to unreasonable ones!" Therefore, he will abide by all the regulations of the Ministry of Education and enforce strict discipline. "Absolutely no bad students!"

Talking About the College of Engineering

The students of the College of Engineering of Beiping Provisional University have repeatedly petitioned Mr. Fu and other relevant authorities, requesting that the College of Engineering be independent and not jointly managed by Peking University and Tsinghua University. Regarding this issue, Mr. Fu said, "I am truly angry. I am in charge of Peking University, and I simply do not have the energy to co-manage the College of Engineering. Their students claim that co-management is imperialism, which is simply an insult to the reputations of Peking University and Tsinghua University!"

When in Chongqing, Mr. Fu had generally stated that professors who participated in puppet organizations would not be rehired. Therefore, the professors of Beiping Provisional University are feeling uneasy and, I hear, are brewing countermeasures. When the reporter mentioned this issue, Mr. Fu said, "What was said back then can be ignored. In short, I have my own professors. The professors of the Southwest Associated University abandoned their meager belongings, each bringing only fifteen kilograms, to move back to Beiping. Why? The professors of Peking University, except for the medical school, have all been invited. The former staff of Peking Union Medical College Hospital who are teaching at the Provisional University's medical school can be retained because they are academically strong."

Evaluating Zhou Zuoren

Regarding Zhou Zuoren, he had this to say: "He has never written a single satisfying article in his life, nor has he ever done a single satisfying thing. His participation in the puppet organization is also in this vein." However, Mr. Fu believes that Zhou Zuoren "is among the lesser offenders among the major traitors." His evaluation of Qian Daosun is quite different: "Compared to him, Qian Daosun is much more detestable. I heard that even after the Japanese Emperor issued the Imperial Rescript on Surrender, he still didn't believe that Japan's surrender was real!" Finally, he also talked about the difference between the student movement during the "May Fourth" period and the current student movement. Mr. Fu's view is as follows: "The May Fourth Movement opposed the traitorous Beiyang government. I personally participated in it, so I know very clearly. But who are they opposing now? Are they opposing the government that endured eight years of resistance against Japan? If that is the case, then they are also opposing the school, and I have no way to sympathize with them!"

Visiting the Wen Tianxiang Shrine

Mr. Fu said that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek invited him again the day before yesterday for a "casual chat" for two hours while visiting the Wen Tianxiang Shrine and discussing many issues. Visiting the Wen Tianxiang Shrine was suggested by Mr. Fu. Chairman Chiang did not even know that there was a Wen Tianxiang Shrine in Beiping. They both agreed that promoting national integrity was very necessary. Therefore, he has already instructed the Beiping municipal authorities to renovate the shrine and to have the Fuxue Hutong Elementary School, which is currently using the shrine as its school site, take extra care to protect it because Wen Tianxiang wrote his Righteous Spirit Song and was imprisoned for three years and killed at this place. Mr. Fu said that the two large trees in the shrine indeed have their large branches extending southward, pointing towards the capital of the Song Dynasty.

Peking University is currently engaging in construction to repair its school buildings in preparation for its restoration. Mr. Fu has indeed spent a lot of energy on this. He wants to restore "Peking University to its former glory." President Hu Shih has already departed from the United States and is returning to China via the Panama Canal. He will arrive in Nanjing in July and Beiping in August. More than thirty faculty and staff members who evacuated from Kunming have already arrived in Beiping. Mr. Fu said that, in any case, school will definitely start after the summer vacation. The Aviation Commission has also promised to help with the restoration, and by the end of June, 80% of the faculty, staff, and students can arrive. The entire Peking University can accommodate 4,500 students. About 1,000 are coming from Kunming, 2,000 are transferring from Beiping Provisional University, and another 1,500 new students will be admitted this summer.

### Kunyu Team's Farewell Match; Loses Again to Hualian; Fifty to Forty-Five

The Kunyu basketball team played its last game in Shanghai last night, suffering another defeat to the local champion Hualian team. The final score was 50 to 45, with Hualian leading 28 to 17 at halftime. All proceeds from last night will be used for the basketball court flooring fund, totaling 4,103,000 yuan. The audience was about 2,000 people, and the atmosphere was quite enthusiastic.

The game was entirely controlled by Hualian. In the first half, Hualian played with its best lineup, including Zhen Zhong, Xue Chongcheng, Zhang Songyuan, and Guangyi, leading all the way. Kunyu's lineup included Da Yun, Shi Kun, Xiang Cheng, Nan Zhen, and Yan Xiong. Last night, Hualian had excellent cooperation and coordination, but their shooting accuracy was lacking. Otherwise, they could have won by a large margin. In the second half, Zhen Zhong and Song Yuan were rested, replaced by Bote and Zhang Liangxiong, and the situation changed drastically. Kunyu took the opportunity to score nine consecutive points, reaching 26 to 28, and then 29 to 31. Hualian still showed no improvement, and Kunyu even took the lead at 33 to 31. Song Yuan re-entered the game, and Kunyu fell behind again, making it 42 to 33. Kunyu's fate was sealed, and the final score was 50 to 45. Tang Shikun and Ren Xiangcheng played very well, but Zhou Dayun did not make much of a contribution last night.

Chunqiu (Spring and Autumn)

### Remnant of Spring (Novel) (1)

— Zhong Yuan

The sun had already risen below the horizon, but the sky was still gray. A drizzling rain permeated the bleak air. The wind blew through the treetops. The entire world seemed enveloped in a heavy fog, with no light, no warmth, no birdsong, no innocent and joyous laughter of young people.

Yet this was spring. After all, it was spring. Though in the darkness and cold, a very small flower was silently blooming.

The flower had no fragrance, for it was too small. And it grew on a thin, fragile stem, seeming as if it might fall off at any moment. But Jian Guang switched on the bedside lamp, and he discovered that the flower was red. Especially set against a white porcelain flowerpot and a few emerald green tender leaves, that little bit of red was simply strikingly red, startlingly red.

As if it had become a habit, whether in the morning or in the middle of the night, whenever Jian Guang woke up, he would always reach for his luminous watch on the pillow to take a look. If it was close to midnight, he would wait a while before falling asleep because the nurse would come to take his temperature at midnight. If it was close to dawn, he would naturally not sleep anymore because he had to take medicine at six o'clock. Now he looked at his watch and saw that it was already 5:45, almost time to take his medicine, although it was still pitch black outside, no different from midnight.

Jian Guang put the watch back on the pillow, turned his head, and gazed excitedly at that little red flower. The flower was placed on a tea table by his bedside. He had asked a friend to buy it for him just yesterday. He had instructed his friend to buy a light-colored, budding flower so that he could watch the pale, tender petals emerge from the bud one by one. Unexpectedly, overnight, the flower had bloomed silently. Bloomed: such a startlingly red color!

He stroked his thin chest and felt his heart beating very fast. Yes, he had once loved red. Three years ago, he had chased after red as if he were crazy—red rouge, red lips, red fingernails, red dancing skirts... But now, he was sick. He had coughed up piles of fresh blood. Blood was red, a red fresher than roses, a red more flamboyant than rouge, but it was blood... How terrible!

He did not admit that his mind was somewhat abnormal, but he was now truly afraid of seeing red things. He steadied himself and stared hard at the little red flower on the tea table. Finally, with a "snap," he switched off the lamp.

"It's red again! What cruel teasing!" He turned his head inward, calling out in his heart, painfully and softly.

Of course, he would not fall asleep again, but his eyes closed. In the moment they closed, a pure white figure flashed in from the doorway.

Daylight, dark clouds, wind, and rain were of no use; there were still a few faint rays of light in the room.

Miss Li Ying's shadow gradually became clearer. She was wearing white clothes and a white hat. Her oval face was white, her round arms were white, her whole body was white. However, in all that dazzling white, there was a point of extremely distinct and striking red: her delicate red lips.

Jian Guang heard her walk in. The slight sound of her footsteps was what he knew best: slow, hesitant, and seemingly with some timidity. The faint fragrance of her hair was also what he knew best: serene, fragrant, and with a hint of the sweetness of roses. He immediately associated it with that point of red standing out in the pure white, a red that shook his soul...

The drizzling rain splattered on the glass window, drip-drop, and Miss Li Ying's rubber shoes fell on the floor, also drip-drop.

Jian Guang knew that she was standing by the bed. However, he dared not open his eyes or turn his head. He stubbornly held down his fiercely beating heart and buried his head in the pillow. That lovely and terrible scene flashed before his eyes again:

Half a month ago, the spring sunlight was warm, bright, filled with intoxicating color and fragrance.

Jian Guang sat quietly in the garden. His home was small but very beautiful, with weeping willows, grass, a fishpond, a rockery, and flowerbeds filled with fragrant flowers. It was afternoon at this time, and the sunlight was slightly slanted to the west. He sat under the shade of the willow, eagerly waiting for someone.

He seemed somewhat tired because he had just returned home from the hospital to recuperate. His illness had not healed, and the doctor had instructed him to continue resting at home. Therefore, his head gradually leaned back against the chair, and his eyelids gradually drooped. But just then, the sound of light footsteps startled him.

Was it her? Had she really come as promised!

She was Li Ying, a nurse he had met in the hospital. The first time she came to feed him medicine with a medicine tray, he had been captivated by her beauty. He thought she was like a white rose with a red heart—her whole body was white, but her delicate lips were surprisingly red. He was fascinated by this strange red!

He was young, passionate, and had experienced countless beautiful dreams. Logically, it shouldn't have been too difficult, but he was too weak. Every time she came, he could only stare with ardent eyes at her bright red lips. He simply didn't have the strength to speak. Until yesterday, when he left the hospital, he finally mustered the courage to give her a slip of paper with these two sentences written on it:

"I love you! I cannot leave you! Please come to my house at 3:00 PM tomorrow."

It was originally like reaching out a hand into the vast void, and even more vaguely waiting. He had no confidence in his heart. Unexpectedly, she had come as promised! How excited this should make him!

Like obtaining a long-desired treasure, he jumped up from the chair and staggered forward to greet her, grabbing her hand...

Sitting together under the shade of the willow, they began to talk. She told him that she had noticed his feelings long ago and told him that as long as it could make him happy, she would be willing to come and see him often, hoping that his health would recover soon.

The sunlight shone on the whitewashed wall, making the wall red as if it had drunk wine. Jian Guang's face was also red as if he had drunk wine.

Finally, he forgot his illness. He returned to the beautiful dreams he had had before: spring, everywhere was light, everywhere was fragrance, red flowers, red lips... fragrant, passionate... the spring of young people, his spring!...

Too excited! A strong fire burned in his heart. He embraced her, disregarding everything. He wanted to kiss her!

But just as she was making a slight struggle, his hand loosened, his face contorted in pain, and fresh blood gushed out of his mouth like a tide!

The events of half a month ago seemed like yesterday. He remembered it clearly: the bright red blood flowed and flowed. She screamed in fright. His parents and family rushed to the garden, and they hurriedly sent him back to the hospital. He remembered even more clearly: On the first night he re-entered the hospital, she sat by his bed for two hours, saying only one sentence: "I harmed you. I shouldn't have come to see you!" He also remembered: From that day on, she no longer served him, nor did she come to see him much. She only came for a while every morning, very politely asking, "Are you well today?" and then left.

Now, she stood before his bed, politely asking him again, "Mr. Shen, are you well today?"

Jian Guang opened his eyes, and a teardrop rolled onto the pillow. He did not answer, only nodded slightly.

She was somewhat moved and said gently, "Doctor He said that your illness will definitely get better, but you must be pure in heart and have few desires!"

Pure in heart and have few desires! Jian Guang's heart sank, and another teardrop rolled out.

Li Ying quietly walked out, her steps light, her hair fragrant, springtime was hers, she was very happy. In the corridor, she met the young Doctor He, she lowered her head shyly.

"Darling!" Doctor He looked around to make sure no one was there, stepped forward to grab her hand, and affectionately complained, "Why do you still go to see that guy?" (To be continued)

### The Start of Shanghai Art Work

— Wen Zhaotong

The Shanghai Art Association, established during this year's Art Festival—March 25th—has, through two months of effort, prepared this Victory Boxing Exhibition. Is its content suitable for our current needs? Can it express the changes that the eight-year war of resistance has brought to art? Can it represent the main trends of the entire Shanghai art scene? We dare not be responsible for guaranteeing these things here, nor is it necessary, because everyone can examine and observe it for themselves and come to a conclusion. However, at least it should be acknowledged that this exhibition is the starting point for Shanghai art work. From now on, there will certainly be more, more practical, and more needed art work unfolding. If the association only wants to successfully hold this exhibition today, and writers only want to have better works to participate in this exhibition, and the public only observes the quality of Shanghai art work at this exhibition, then all of this would be in vain.

During this revision of the elementary school curriculum standards meeting, everyone raised the issue of the current lack of art teachers. Therefore, what we ask of the Shanghai Art Association, for the sake of promoting art education, is that planning and implementing art teacher training is the first important task.

The creation of art works depends on theoretical guidance, and the recognition of art works depends on the establishment of criticism. The introduction of foreign art and the preservation and development of inherent art depend on the development of research and organization work. Here, we really should at least need an art magazine, which is the second important task.

The success or failure of the Victory Boxing Exhibition, in terms of the minimum requirements for current Shanghai art work, does not occupy an absolutely important position, because it is the beginning.

### Flying Together (47) Zhao Qingge

As a result, Zhang Xian became complacent, venting his anger on Lihua and gaining benefits at the same time. So he quickly changed his tone and said to Mrs. Mo:

"Whether to increase the money or not is not important, it's just that your young lady's temper must be changed. I'm teaching her so hard, and if she can study hard and diligently, I guarantee that she can be on stage by next year at the latest. But she is just too disobedient."

"Thank you, Master! Don't worry, I will definitely teach her a lesson and tell her to listen to you in the future," Mrs. Mo said with a smile. She was really happy! Happy for that dream that was about to come true.

Lihua heard all of this. She secretly complained about her unfortunate fate! She knew that she would not have good days for a long time. She hated Zhang Xian, and at the same time she hated Mrs. Mo! What she did not understand was: Mrs. Mo was her biological mother, so why did she have the heart to force her to be sent to a bad person to be ruined and abused? If it was for her good, then she was clearly being subjected to the most cruel punishment! If she was guilty, she was only a nine-year-old child, oh, she was innocent! She had no reason to be beaten so badly, to be trampled upon in the freezing cold of winter! But what could she do? She had no power to resist! Mrs. Mo taught her to obey, and obedience was filial piety! She could only swallow her tears forever, which was her fate!

Lihua finally fell ill and could not get out of bed for several days. Mrs. Mo was so anxious that she hired many famous doctors to treat her. Not for anything else, but to hope that she would recover soon and continue to learn opera. Naturally, also because she was her daughter. For these two reasons, Lihua found it hard to live and hard to die! Sorrow grew in her heart day by day! She vaguely felt that she was no longer a person, but an object, a cat or a dog! Her life was controlled by others, and her death was also controlled by others! Others could arbitrarily dispose of her, and others could arbitrarily slaughter her!

"These, these, do you know them, Daddy!"

In her most painful moments, Lihua would whisper this to the night sky, reaching out a hand for help to the sky.

But the night was dark! In the darkness, there was no justice, no fairness!

### Foreign Rice Has Arrived, Grain Prices Gradually Decline, Rice Market is Returning to Normal, White Rice Entered the Border Yesterday at 50,000

Yesterday, the rice market sales were still slow, and people's sentiment was further softening. Market transactions were extremely rare, with both Japonica and Indica rice prices falling by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. White Indica rice had no formal trading open. Flour continued to fall by 800 to 900 yuan, and bran fell again by a small amount of 100 to 200 yuan. Yellow soybeans from Henan province continued to arrive, but sales were average, with prices falling by 1,000 yuan. Soybean cakes remained oversupplied, falling again by 400 to 500 yuan. The oil market was flooded with goods and sales were slow, with prices falling by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. New broad beans continued to arrive in large quantities, but lower-grade goods fell by a small amount of 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Wheat and corn prices were average. New wheat had limited trading and has not opened. Red sorghum continued to fall by 1,000 yuan. Raw peanuts were in short supply and remained strong. Plain flour also decreased by 50 yuan per catty. Yesterday, rice arrived in the city. According to information from the rice market, a total of more than 4,000 shi (a unit of dry measure, approximately 120 liters) of seven types, including white rice, arrived. The types and quantities are as follows: White rice 1,841 shi, early rice 534 shi, Du Indica 57 shi, white rice 235 shi, thin rice 1,332 shi, Yang Indica 70 shi, and Wu Indica 904 shi.

According to a statement from the Special Commissioner for Grain Administration, Wang Daren, nearly 300,000 tons of foreign rice ordered by the Ministry of Food and the China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Corporation have arrived to date, all of which were ordered from the Brazil in South America. In addition, the 290,000 tons of rice for China decided by the UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration can also be shipped to China in the short term. With the large-scale arrival of foreign rice, the future of the people's food supply is very promising.

### Merchants Purchasing Foreign Rice · Bank of China Supplies Foreign Exchange

The import trade of foreign rice will soon become greatly active. Currently, British firm Jardine Matheson, French firm Compagnie Asiatique de Commerce, Jewish firm Fu Shuen & Co., and Chinese firm Renren Enterprise Co., are handling the import trade of foreign rice, contacting Brazil and other regions in South America to order foreign rice. It is reported that the cost of shipping each bag (one shi and two dou of rice) from Brazil to Shanghai, including freight, is about 20 US dollars. Currently, the Bank of China authorities plan to provide as much foreign exchange as possible for the purchase of foreign rice, and the ordering procedures are also very convenient.

### Atmosphere for Using US Dollars to Assist Purchases is Strong, Gold Prices Turn Upward from Weakness

Yesterday, the gold market initially weakened due to reports that the issue of war and peace was again showing signs of hope, but the sentiment for using US dollars to assist purchases was still easy to pull up the price. The market opened slightly lower in the morning, and various parties continuously released gold, further lowering the price. After 10 a.m., the Bank of China allocated 1.81 million, totaling 127 bars. After that, the market turned from calm to weak again. Before noon, it had fallen below the 1.8 million mark, but buyers who were maintaining the price at low levels began to become active again. At noon, the price was around 1.81 million. The market was still flat in the early afternoon, but the soaring US dollar stimulated buying, pushing the price up to 1.855 million before leveling off. The final result was not much different from the previous close. Gold ornaments were at 196,000, silver bullion at 2,200, silver dollars were stable, private exchange rates were average, and interest rates ranged from 17 cents to 14 cents.

The atmosphere of strong US dollars assisting purchases was strong, and news continued to spread. Therefore, after the market opened in the morning, the price of 2,330 yuan was only slightly affected by the gold market, and the price of 2,320 yuan remained firm for a long time. At noon, it was still struggling at the original price. In the afternoon, it was finally stimulated, and it became even more difficult to apply for US exchange. Importers rushed to settle US dollars, and a sudden surge in prices rose by more than 100 yuan in an instant, reaching a high price of 2,450 yuan. Then, it slightly retraced and hovered around 2,400 yuan. The final result was an increase of 55 yuan from the previous close. Hong Kong banknotes were stable, and the buying price increased slightly. US exchange rates were nominally flat but privately tight, and the selling prices of Indian and Hong Kong exchange rates were slightly higher, but trading was less.

### Public Bonds Pulled Up Again

Public bonds were cautious yesterday, with both buyers and sellers waiting for an opportunity. The range of price fluctuations was narrow. Unified type C opened crossing the 6,000 yuan mark, trading around 6,250 yuan. After the opening, it was briefly pushed up to 6,370 yuan before sellers began to release. The low price only dropped to 6,130 yuan before being pulled up again. The final result was an increase of 500 yuan from the previous close. Types A and B rose by 350 yuan, and Types D and E also rose by 300 yuan. Bidding prices continued to rise after the close.

### Tea Market Trends are Promising

Tea prices are not low... Exports are difficult to become clear. Recently, shops in this street, Suzhou, Wuxi, Tianjin and other places have been actively acquiring red and green tea varieties, and trading is still lively. Prices are also unusually sharp. The upward trend may expand. As for the foreign firms' tea market, Zhen Mei and Zhen Mei green teas, which specialize in sales to Africa and Morocco, are still favored in those regions, but new goods have not yet been produced. Therefore, foreign firms are choosing Chen tea with excellent quality to meet the needs. However, the sellers are loosening their grip, so the trend continues to be promising. In addition, according to news from the production area of Qimen black tea, new goods have already been launched on the market, but due to the high cost of all kinds of taxes and fees, the cost is also high, at least 200,000 yuan per dan (approximately 50 kilograms). If viewed from the perspective of foreign countries, there is an appetite for prices between 120,000 and 130,000 yuan. As for the new Bailin black tea that arrived in Shanghai a few days ago, although Jardine Matheson is in negotiations, the price offered is only 80,000 yuan per dan, but the cost for the seller has reached over 100,000 yuan, so whether the deal will be concluded is still uncertain.

### In the Midst of Securities Exchange Opening, Stock Buying is Booming

Yesterday, the buying of Chinese stocks was still stimulated by unpopular stocks. Great China Match, Sin Ho Underwear, New Asia, and Sino-French were the most popular. However, due to excessive surges in the middle of the day, high prices were followed by declines. Wing On Yarn's high price was 6,100 yuan, and the low price was 5,830 yuan. Mayer's high price was 4,550 yuan, and the low price was 4,330 yuan. King Fook's high price was 337 yuan, and the low price was 303 yuan. Around noon, the market generally stabilized. In the end, Wing On Yarn and Mayer continued to be slightly favored, and King Fook, New Kwong, and Keen Hing rose by 5% to 10%. Among the unpopular small and medium-sized stocks, except for Wing Foong, which did not show any signs of recovery, most of them rose by another 5% to 20%. Veteran stocks were also favored by large buyers, rising by 10% to 20%. Bidding prices continued to rise in the afternoon. Foreign stocks continued to be pushed up. Ewo Silk Mill briefly rose to around 13,200 yuan before some profit-taking led to a small decline to 12,500 yuan. Ewo Brewery declined from 2,900 yuan, Asia General from 4,300 yuan, and Asia from 2,100 yuan. In the end, compared to the previous close, Ewo Silk Mill, Asia, British American Tobacco, and Wheelock Marden slightly increased, while Ewo Brewery, Steel, Paper, and Asia General each rose by about 10%.

### Import of Cosmetics and Other Items: Foreign Exchange Will Not Be Provided Unless Approved by the Bank of China

[Reported by this newspaper] A reporter recently heard rumors that the Central Bank would stop the settlement of foreign exchange for certain imported goods. They visited Mr. Lin Weiying, Director of the Foreign Exchange Examination Department of the Central Bank, for confirmation. According to Mr. Lin, the Central Bank has noticed that the import volume of cosmetics and fruits has been quite considerable recently. Therefore, it has notified all designated banks handling foreign exchange that, starting from May 28, if importers and exporters apply to settle foreign exchange for these imported goods, they must first obtain approval from the Central Bank before they are allowed to settle. Otherwise, no foreign exchange will be provided. It is reported that these imported goods include: (1) Cosmetics, shaving soap, face cream, toothpaste, talcum powder, hair water, and products for the mouth, teeth, and hair. (2) Fresh fruits. (3) Gelatin products. (4) Canned foods. (5) Fountain pens. (6) Toiletries.

### Tianjin Implements Price Limits, Designating Ten Items Including Electrical Materials

The Tianjin Municipal Social Affairs Bureau believes that general prices have been rising recently, and the implementation of price limits and price negotiations should be strictly enforced to achieve practical results. The prices of electrical materials, tea, laundry, department stores, barber shops, foil products, and other ten industries that have been publicly negotiated have been notified to the police bureau to send personnel to inspect them at any time to see if there are any violations. If there are any deliberate violations or arbitrary price increases, they will be detained and prosecuted.

### Refined Salt Arrives in Shanghai for the First Time

[Reported by this newspaper] China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Hai Zhe ship returned to Shanghai from Tianjin yesterday. In addition to transporting northern goods such as melon seeds, jujubes, and walnuts, there were also 5,000 packages of refined salt, which were declared by the Jiuda Refined Salt Company. The import of refined salt is the first time since the war. In addition, the Cai E ship, which arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, transported 1,600 tons of edible salt from Lianyungang. It is reported that the salt needs to be transferred to ships for transportation to Wuhan.

Also, Taikoo's Beihai ship sailed south today, carrying 18,000 railway sleepers to Hong Kong, which will be used by the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway.

### Worsted Wool Prices are Chaotic

The worsted wool market has lacked standard prices recently because the supply of goods is extremely tight and most transactions are piecemeal. Especially for summer goods in high demand, transactions depend on whether they are released first. If the buyer is looking for goods, the seller will raise the selling price. Conversely, if the seller needs cash and wants to sell, the buyer will say that actual sales are poor, and even if the price is lowered somewhat, it will be difficult to sell. In short, the success or failure of the current selling price completely depends on opportunity. There is also evidence that if Company A quotes 55,000 yuan per bolt, Company B will shout 60,000 yuan. If more than ten yards are sold at 60,000 yuan, Company C will quote 62,000 or 63,000 yuan. If two or three sets are sold, then Company D will want to quote 65,000 or 66,000 yuan. Several companies in the industry, such as Kwok Tai and Wai Cheong, have gone bankrupt due to the influence of high-interest loans.

### Yarn Prices Fall Unanimously · Calico Market Conditions are Mediocre

Yesterday, the yarn market was weak and unable to recover. Large yarn mills such as Yema saw their prices fall by 40,000, with few results. The remaining 20-count mixed brands also fell by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. The 42-count yarns saw the worst decline, plummeting by a huge 130,000 yuan. The 32-count fine yarns also fell by 70,000 to 80,000 yuan. The trend still seems weak, and morale is also very low.

The cloth market has slowed down due to stagnant actual transactions, and morale has turned weak. There are many sellers looking to exit, so the situation has softened. All grades of cotton cloth have fallen by 250 to 1,000 yuan. However, 12-pound calico is still needed by Tianjin merchants, so it has risen by 500 yuan alone. In the afternoon, it was heard that Sichuan, Shanxi, and northern Anhui areas had a good demand for broadcloth and other cloths, so the market price rebounded by 500 yuan compared to the morning. Yesterday, the New York American cotton cable reported a drop of 2 to 16 points per pound. The recent price was 28.26 US dollars, the forward price was 18.63, and the Metling spot price was 28.88. The cotton market in this city was mediocre, but trading was more active. Private yarn factories such as Shih Foong, Lai Sang, Ka Foong, and Chun Hing all had purchases.

### Fuel Trading is Sparse

According to news from the Coal Industry Association, the association's market has been extremely sluggish recently. Among them, coal briquettes are the most sluggish item. Not only is the supply of various grades of goods abundant, but there is also a lack of sales. Most retail buyers dislike the high prices and cannot afford them. The bituminous coal market is doing slightly better. Anthracite coal is neglected due to seasonal factors. The future of fuel is unanimously seen as weak. According to news from the firewood and charcoal industry, recently, the quantity of firewood and charcoal transported from Jiangsu and Zhejiang to Shanghai is considerable, with an average of about 4,000 to 5,000 dan arriving every day, and the prices are very low.

### Deposit Reserve: Tianjin and Beijing Negotiate Payment in Substitutes

[Tianjin News] The Banking Law formulated by the Ministry of Finance has been issued to Tianjin. According to Chen Lihou, Chairman of the Tianjin Bankers Association, according to the usual practice in the banking industry, half of the deposits must be retained to meet withdrawals, and the other half must be circulated. If another 20% is set aside as a reserve, then only 30% of the circulating funds will be available, which poses a risk of illiquidity. The Tianjin and Beijing Bankers Associations plan to present the actual difficulties to the authorities and suggest that the reserve be paid not in legal tender, but in the form of marketable securities or other valuable items, so that the circulating funds will not be reduced.

### Old Casing Export Fails to Meet Standards and is Returned

Due to the impact of foreign price limits, not much casing is exported from China. Furthermore, a batch of small four-barrel casings were returned because they did not meet the standards. According to news from the casing industry, the returned casing was exported by a certain foreign firm. Because it was old casing, it did not meet the standards. Also, the foreign firm had already ceased operations when the casings were returned.

### Rosin Sales are Weak · Tallow Prices are Reported to be Rising in Production Areas

Due to the ban on exports in recent years, there is a large amount of raw rosin in stock in the interior. Recently, shipments from production areas have been continuously transported, but sales are weak. The current price of raw rosin in the Shanghai market is around 20,000 yuan per dan, and it is difficult to transport large quantities. Because raw rosin has few uses, it must be processed into refined rosin before it can be used as an industrial raw material. Currently, the price in the production area is only over 10,000 yuan per dan, plus transportation costs, which amount to at least 10,000 yuan per dan when it arrives in Shanghai. Therefore, most merchants who transport rosin from the interior to Shanghai are buying their own stock.

[Another report] Soap factories in Shanghai are currently purchasing large quantities of tallow from production areas, so the price of tallow in production areas is soaring. As a result, Shanghai is also following suit. The best price in the Shanghai market has reached over 80,000 yuan per dan, but in reality, coconut oil is arriving in a steady stream, and its price is equal to that of tallow, so the rising tallow price may be a temporary phenomenon.

### Caustic Soda Prices Rise Sharply · It is Not Easy to Fall for a While

Yesterday, caustic soda prices rose sharply because the dyeing and weaving factories in this city purchased a large quantity of it, coupled with various rumors. Firms were hoarding goods and were unwilling to sell them, so the price rose from 300,000 to 500,000 yuan in a week. Recently, people are optimistic, and it is feared that the price will not fall easily for a while. According to a certain foreign firm, soda ash is being distributed, and a large amount of sodium sulfide has arrived at the port, so the price has fallen slightly.

### Sino-US Joint Venture · Large-Scale Electrical Factory

The National Resources Commission's Central Electrical Equipment Factory's existing equipment is insufficient for its needs. The Japanese electrical factories taken over in Shanghai after the war are also poorly equipped. The factory's general manager, Hui Yintang, traveled from Shanghai to the United States at the end of April to purchase electrical machinery and various electrical raw materials, and to hire technical personnel to come to China to assist in construction. Currently, the factory is cooperating with a large-scale electrical factory in the United States and has signed a contract to establish a large-scale electrical equipment factory in China. In the future, China's various electrical equipment can be manufactured in large quantities and will no longer need to rely on others.

### World Textile Situation Changes · All Countries Need Cotton Textiles Urgently · Giving the United States an Opportunity to Expand Abroad

[Reuters, New Orleans, 6th] Paul Rens, President of the American Textile Exporters Association, wrote in "Southern Textile News" that the world market needs at least 4.5 billion yards of cotton textiles, while only 2.5 billion yards flowed into the world market in 1945. The world textile situation has undergone significant changes in recent years. Japan used to be an important cotton textile exporting country. Before the Pearl Harbor incident, it had a total of 12 million spindles, but now it only has 3 million spindles left. In 1937, the total export value of world cotton textiles was about 6.5 billion yards, of which Japan accounted for more than one-third, the United Kingdom accounted for 1.8 billion yards, and European countries accounted for 1.2 billion yards. In 1937, the United States exported about 200 million yards of cotton textiles. In the near future, the United Kingdom, India, or Japan have no hope of resuming exports. Therefore, it is an unprecedentedly good opportunity for the United States to develop the cotton textile market abroad.

### Silk Goods Continue to Rise · Factory Trading is Still Good

Yesterday, the highest spot price for No. 120 Daqiao silk in the morning was 1.32 million yuan, and the lowest was 1.293 million to 1.3 million yuan. There was no change in the afternoon. Mixed brands were all short. Beauty silk was down by 20,000 yuan, and Xuhui silk was down by 10,000 yuan. No. 150 Daqiao silk was down by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. The opening price of China Textile Company's goods was similar to the price on Thursday of last week. The Shanghai Uniformity Textile Company had a strong demand for yarn, but there was a shortage of supply. The prices of user yarn and dry yarn have been quite stable in recent days, and trading is still good. The silk goods market was good again yesterday. The morning price for Mayer silk blankets was 1.99 million yuan per hundred, and the bidding price in the afternoon was 3 million yuan, but there were no transactions. The morning price for Dachung checkered crepe was 4,470 yuan per yard, and the afternoon price for deferred delivery was 4,650 yuan.

### Economic Briefs

According to reliable information, 10,000 tons of Taiwan sugar currently stored in Keelung have been ordered by the Executive Yuan to be shipped to Shanghai by China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. The Taiwan Sugar Corporation Management Committee is currently processing the export procedures, and it can be shipped to Shanghai in mid-month.

According to news from relevant parties, Sino-Soviet trade is still sluggish, and there has been no major development recently. Our barter trade with the Soviet Union is still being delivered on a monthly basis. The Soviet Union previously proposed to order 240,000 dan of new and old tea leaves from us, but the offer price was too low, and no agreement has been reached yet.

The Sugar Market Association set the price of medium-grade granulated white sugar at 71,000 yuan to 70,500 yuan. The bid for numbered medium-grade granulated white sugar was 70,500 yuan, but no transaction was made.

### A Comet Shines on a Gloomy Corner: The Chairman and His Wife in the Northeast

Shenyang is currently in early summer, and the tender green branches and leaves appear particularly lush and lovely. They cover up most of the destruction and incompleteness, and at the same time give people some comfort and vitality.

A rain extinguished the sandstorm and washed away the dust on the streets. People who have spent a spring and even extending into the early summer in sandstorms have a particularly fresh and fulfilling feeling. This seems ordinary to people in the Jiangnan region who are used to "gentle breezes and bright sunshine" and "bright spring sunshine", but it is rare and precious here.

The weather has arranged such a good environment, and the people of Northeast China have thought that this is a sign of the arrival of extraordinary people. Sure enough, a "Meiling" plane carried the Chairman, Madame Chiang Kai-shek, and the newly appointed Minister of National Defense, Bai Chongxi. This happened at 4 p.m. on May 23.

Before the Manchu Dynasty, it was almost unheard of for the head of state of our country to visit the Northeast. Therefore, the arrival of the Chairman and his wife this time is worthy of special mention in the Northeast chapter of Chinese history. What's more, the people of the Great Northeast are eagerly awaiting the Chairman's visit, which is like "hoping for rain in a great drought"!

### National Treasures and Famous Places Light Up Together

This is a major event after the restoration of the Northeast territory. When the general public learned that the Chairman had arrived, they paid attention to the movements on the streets. Apart from noticing some precautions in certain places, there was no "street cleaning" scene. At the same time, most people saw the Chairman and his accompanying staff in several cars driving into the carriage team, sometimes brushing past crowds. This open and magnanimous demeanor and mind left a very good impression on the people of the Northeast!

The Qing Dynasty palace is located between the Dadong and Daxi city gates. It was built during the "Chongde" reign of Emperor Taizong of the Qing Dynasty, more than 310 years ago. The faded pavilions and terraces are still supporting the momentum of that year. Inside the Great Qing Gate, it is divided into eastern, central, and western parts. The eastern part is the "Dazheng Hall," commonly known as the "Ten Princes Pavilion," where Emperor Taizong and the princes discussed politics. The central part is the "Chongzheng Hall," where the Emperor listened to government affairs. Behind it is the imperial palace. The western part is the famous "Wen Su Ge."

"Wen Su Ge" is one of the "Inner Court Four Pavilions" of the Qing Dynasty for storing the Complete Library of the Four Treasuries. Since the storage of a copy of the Complete Library of the Four Treasuries in the forty-eighth year of Qianlong, it has undergone relocation, chaos, copying, and patching for more than sixty years. After the September 18 Incident, the Japanese planned to plunder it to Tokyo twice, but it was finally abandoned due to the efforts of local people. In the twenty-fourth year of the Republic of China, the puppet Manchukuo Ministry of Education allocated huge funds to rebuild a two-story new library, which is in line with modern library regulations. The Preparatory Committee lawyer Chen Rongli and relevant people from the Shenyang women's community discussed promoting women's and children's welfare work in the Northeast. They are very willing to support the planned use of the former Japanese consulate staff dormitory to establish kindergartens and nurseries. The garden is large and the environment is excellent, which is very suitable for children to play and rest. Unfortunately, many houses have been damaged and need to be greatly repaired. In the future, after the opening, it may be able to slightly comfort the people of Shenyang for their past admiration and envy of the good education enjoyed by Japanese children. However, the general local people live far away from peaceful areas, and whether their children will have the opportunity to receive education in the future is a question worth studying.

### Abundant Charm of the Tea Party

In the Shenyang Municipal Government Auditorium, a tea party held on the afternoon of the 27th at 4 o'clock was quite grand in scale. It was a tea party held jointly by the chairman and his wife to entertain people from all walks of life in Shenyang and foreign guests. More than two hundred people attended, including foreign consuls, missionaries, celebrities, Allied soldiers, local gentry, civil and military officials, and journalists. They gathered together, exchanged sentiments, and maintained a very quiet and harmonious atmosphere.

The Chairman and his wife arrived at the venue at 4:15 PM, and everyone stood up and applauded to welcome them. Madam Chiang went to take her seat, and the Chairman, with a warm smile, frequently nodded in response, repeatedly saying, "Please be seated, everyone." Then, he briefly exchanged pleasantries with Bishop Yu Bin and foreign guests nearby, and then tea and refreshments were served. The Chairman occasionally chatted briefly with Director Xiong beside him, while Madam Chiang spoke softly with Vice Chief Bai next to her.

After a short period of time, the Chairman rose to his feet amidst applause and delivered a brief five-minute speech in a somber tone. The Chairman said: "Our compatriots in the Northeast have suffered fourteen years of long-term oppression and suffering. The government has failed to come to their rescue earlier, and we feel extremely regretful. During these fourteen years, I have felt very sad and uneasy in my heart."

"Today, we can only encourage each other, not forget the past suffering, take responsibility, and work together to build the Northeast, to build a new China of the Three Principles of the People after victory, to encourage ourselves and others!" "The United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and other countries among the Allied nations have all come to help us. On the one hand, we are grateful, and on the other hand, we feel deeply regretful, which is that we have not taken up our responsibilities and tasks. From now on, we should all work hard to complete the tasks that we should bear!"

Gentry members such as Zhang Ziwen delivered welcoming speeches, requesting the early restoration of usable factories, improvement of education, relief for the youth, and the designation of Shenyang as a special municipality. The Chairman nodded in agreement to adopt and expedite these matters. When Zhang and others spoke of the suffering they had endured in the past, they were moved to tears. Finally, they stated that the people of the Northeast would surely repay the motherland with their blood and sweat, making the Northeast a strong gateway to the motherland. The Chairman, Madam Chiang, and others were deeply moved.

After the meeting, the Four Dimensions Children's Troupe of the Youth Army's 207th Division presented drama, singing, and performed plays to add to the festive atmosphere. The meeting concluded at around 6 PM. When the Chairman left the municipal government, many people had been waiting outside for a long time, eager to catch a glimpse of the Chairman and his wife's elegance. The Chairman and his wife then ascended to the platform on the second floor of the municipal government to accept cheers and frequently waved to the citizens, who responded with applause. Both sides were filled with boundless bitterness and excitement!

### After the Rain, Talking About Changsha - This Newspaper's Dispatch on the 25th - Special Correspondent Gao Yuanli

Changsha is being battered by wind and rain, but fortunately, it's not a violent storm, so people are in a relatively cheerful mood. First of all, agriculture needs rain, and this time it's been widespread, so the prospects for the autumn harvest are relatively promising. The grain shortage that has been worrying people for months may be alleviated somewhat as a result. Secondly, the river has risen sharply, making navigation smooth, and the supply of rice is constant. Rice prices in Changsha are continuously falling, and the common people can barely eke out a living. Unfortunately, however, one of the ships carrying flour from the Relief Administration sank downstream due to the wind, but fortunately, the loss was not too great.

### Provincial Assembly Expenses Exceed 100 Million Yuan

After the rain, everything feels invigorated, and politics is no exception. Take the Changsha Municipal Government, for example: it was established for half a year without doing anything. After the new mayor, Wang Hao, took office, he devoted himself to governing, starting by clearing 200,000 cubic feet of garbage in the city. Naturally, the issue of funds came up first. It was of course impossible to ask the government for money, so he mobilized all the city's citizens to provide labor service. Those who did not provide service were charged 2,500 yuan per day as the cost of hiring laborers. It is expected that all the garbage will be cleared within three months, which is indeed a meritorious act. As the season approaches, the epidemic may improve somewhat.

The Provincial Assembly also held its first session during this period. This was the first popularly elected assembly. The provincial assembly members, elected under fierce competition, numbered seventy-eight. Except for Liu Xingwei from Qiyang who did not arrive, seventy-seven members attended, creating a magnificent and lively scene. After the meeting, the election of the speaker and deputy speaker also reached a fever pitch. Mr. Zhao Yanwu, who had previously served as the speaker of the Provisional Assembly, competed with Zhang Xingfang, the current director of the Provincial Party Headquarters. In the end, Zhao Yanwu won the title again. The position of deputy speaker fell to Mr. Tang Boqiu. Tang is a textile magnate in Hunan and the current director of the Xiangnan No. 1 Textile Factory. He is one of the most eye-catching members of the Assembly. The Assembly session lasted two weeks, during which more than two hundred proposals were discussed, covering a wide range of topics, even including the names of roads in various counties and cities. Zhang Benqing, a county assembly member, said that all road names should only be named after former and contemporary sages, such as Sun Yat-sen as a former sage and the Chairman as a contemporary sage, so names like Boling Road and Boling Bridge should be abolished. The content of other proposals generally focused on the current provincial administration, but lacked unity and creativity. Proposals to seek relief for their respective counties were submitted by every assembly member. Yu Jichuan, the director of the Relief Administration, told reporters yesterday: "Every county wants relief, but which county should be given it? I asked them to propose specific solutions, but none of them could." The assembly members kept saying that they were speaking on behalf of the people, but this session of the Assembly was largely using disaster relief as political capital, as if they would be failing their constituents if they didn't submit proposals to request government relief. Someone estimated that the expenses for the provincial assembly members' elections in various counties and the expenses for this session of the Assembly totaled more than 100 million yuan (of which travel expenses alone amounted to 45 million yuan). If all of it were used to relieve disaster victims, it would be a small but significant supplement, because the emergency agricultural loans allocated by the central government to Hunan were only 1 billion yuan.

### Recognize "Saving Lives First" and Devote All Efforts to Urgent Relief

Speaking of the Hunan disaster, many people used to get a headache just mentioning it. Since President Truman sent Harrison to Hunan to inspect the situation in person, relief supplies have been arriving in a steady stream. The Relief Administration's work is intensifying day by day, and the storage and transportation stations are working around the clock. The situation in southern Hunan, such as Lingling and Qiyang, has improved relatively well, but the situation in Hengyang is becoming increasingly serious. In the urban area, 30,000 people cannot survive without relief, and in the countryside, as many as 300,000 people have no food to eat. The problem is not that rice is expensive or unavailable, but that people have no money to buy it. The Relief Administration and the government are devoting all their efforts to providing urgent relief. Director Yu Weichuan told reporters: "Saving lives is the top priority." All the grain transported by the Administration is being rushed to Hengyang. Each person receives half a catty of wheat flour per day, and some canned goods are also distributed. Originally, it was planned to provide enough for each person for a month, but due to transportation issues, the grain supply is not yet smooth, so each person can only receive half a month's worth first, so that the number of recipients can be increased to reduce the number of deaths.

"If the disaster situation in Hengyang can improve, the Administration plans to do more in terms of post-disaster work. Chairman Wang Dongyuan and Director Yu Jichuan exchanged views on the issue of post-disaster work the day before yesterday. Because Yu had served as the director of the Hunan Provincial Construction Department for many years, he knew the construction work in Hunan very well, so it would be more practical for the Administration to cooperate with the government to carry out post-disaster restoration work. He said: The entire plan is still in the planning stage, and Yu Jichuan does not want to disclose it yet, but to focus on completing the urgent relief work first, but the principles have been determined. First, is transportation and water conservancy. Yu said that western Hunan accounts for the majority of Hunan's land, and its resources are the most abundant, but transportation is too backward and cannot connect with other areas. The Zi River and Yuan River basins in western Hunan are both rich areas, but the lack of water conservancy is also an obstacle to development. Post-disaster work will focus on these aspects and no longer do things that are just icing on the cake. It will start after the urgent relief work is completed."

### Not Only Disaster and Grain Shortages, but Also a Salt Crisis Recently

However, whether the post-disaster work can begin depends on the autumn harvest situation this year. The provincial government believes that the autumn harvest is one thing, and widely transporting grain to Hunan is another. Waiting for this year's bumper harvest is not only not a solution, but also a long shot. It has also requested and been approved by the central government to allocate an additional 3 billion yuan for the purchase of military grain. This money will be used to purchase grain from outside the province and transport it to Hunan, on the one hand as a reserve of military grain, and on the other hand to stabilize civilian food prices. Coupled with the 400,000 shi of surplus grain from Sichuan and Jiangxi, the phenomenon of grain shortage in Hunan can be improved.

In addition to disaster and grain shortages, Hunan has also recently experienced a salt crisis. Fortunately, the problem was not too big and was resolved soon. The situation was like this: The salt authorities believed that during the war, Sichuan salt was used by the military and civilians in the rear, so production increased and sales expanded. Hunan was originally supplied with Huai salt, but the source of Huai salt was cut off during the war, so it was replaced by Sichuan salt. After the war ended, Huai salt came in a steady stream, and people had not eaten Huai salt for a long time, so they all rushed to buy it, which invisibly caused Sichuan salt to be overstocked. However, the Sichuan salt was purchased by salt merchants with government loans. If no one consumed it, not only would the government lose money, but it would also affect the production in the Sichuan salt region. Therefore, it was stipulated that a certain amount of Sichuan salt should be allocated for sale in the Hunan region every day, but the people were unwilling, saying that the quality of Sichuan salt was not as good as Huai salt and refused to consume it. The salt authorities were quite embarrassed and were criticized by public opinion. Later, after explanations from all parties, it was proven that Sichuan salt and Huai salt were the same, and both had been inspected by the government, so there was no problem with the salt quality. A convenience was also given to the salt merchants, stipulating that for those who purchased more than 50 dan of Sichuan salt from official warehouses, all tax prices were allowed to be paid with bank acceptance drafts or bank-guaranteed term bills, which would be cashed upon maturity. Due to the salt authorities' concessions, the problem was finally resolved.

### About the Sino-American Hospital

Dear Editor: The Baolong Hospital on Baike Road, Mushishi, was founded by the former Germans. After the victory, it was closed because the German expatriates ceased operations. Later, the Allied American military authorities, recognizing that there were many poor and sick people in the city and that the existing hospitals were not able to accommodate them, suggested that our country's authorities establish a Sino-American Hospital. It was originally run jointly with the Sino-American Cooperative Organization, but is now managed by the Military Commission. All the latest equipment of the hospital is provided by the American side, even down to the blankets on the beds, while the personnel are Chinese. To prevent malfeasance, it was originally planned that all the doctors in the hospital would be full-time. Later, because talent was difficult to find, the heads of each department were changed to part-time positions. Le Wenshao, the former president of the First Hospital of the Chinese Red Cross (during the puppet regime), was appointed as the medical director, so almost all the heads of the departments who were hired were former employees of the Red Cross Hospital. It was originally scheduled to open on June 1st, but due to insufficient preparation, it may be slightly delayed. However, according to what this writer knows about the inside situation of the hospital, there are a few points that need to be discussed by the hospital's supervisors and the public:

(1) According to the allocation ratio of beds in various public hospitals in Shanghai, such as the Red Cross, Tongren, and Renji hospitals, third-class beds account for at least 60% of all beds. Because there are many poor people in society, even with so many third-class beds, they are still full every day, and it is very difficult to find one. However, the Sino-American Hospital has determined that third-class beds will only account for 20% of all beds, which is greatly contrary to the original intention of the Allied authorities to sincerely help our poor and sick compatriots!

(2) Although the hospital has not yet opened, the department heads, taking advantage of their part-time positions, have already organized a joint clinic in the ×× pharmaceutical factory near the hospital, the Polb Cnic. It is composed of Le Wenshao (internal medicine), Ren Tinggui and Shao Youshan (surgery), Zhou Chenghu (ophthalmology), Fang Kan (tuberculosis), and Mu Ruifen (otolaryngology). Their intention is nothing more than to follow the old practice of the doctors of the former Baolong Hospital, to solicit wealthy patients from the hospital nearby (which is why there are so many doctors on Baike Road and Chengdu Road) to their private clinics. Therefore, the reason why the hospital plans to have so few third-class beds can also be understood from this!

(3) The hospital is currently being actively prepared. The internal equipment assisted by the Allied forces is sophisticated and plentiful. Although it has not yet been put into practical use, a lot of leakage and disappearance has already occurred! From this, we can see that the intention of our Allied friends to help us and the original intention of our authorities to run the hospital are good, but due to the self-interest of the medical personnel in charge (the director is said to be an amateur), the actual benefits that the poor and sick people of Shanghai will receive in the future are questionable. Wang Yunxun, May 30th.

### Inaugural Address

— The Colleagues of the Superior Physician Society

In the past ten years, scientific medicine has been more widely accepted by society than before. Scientific medicine, which was previously only recognized and enjoyed by a small number of intellectuals, has now gradually penetrated the masses. This progress, on the one hand, has unfolded the dawn of national health, and on the other hand, has given great encouragement to us, a group of medical and health workers.

In our work experience, we feel that there is still a need for more understanding and cooperation between us medical and health workers and the society we serve in order to achieve our common goal - to eradicate disease and enhance human health and happiness. Here, we can explain our position a little more.

(1) Most people only go to the doctor when they are sick, and even then, only when the illness is serious. However, the goal of modern medicine is not limited to the narrow definition of "treatment," but emphasizes preventing disease before it occurs, in order to enjoy the happiness of health. This is what is called "preventive medicine." The highest ideal of us medical and health workers is to eliminate all kinds of diseases. The implementation of preventive medicine is a public health work, and it is not enough to rely solely on doctors, nor is it enough to rely solely on public health personnel. The most important thing is the cooperation of the whole people. How to obtain this most important cooperation is what we must strive to pursue.

(2) Although scientific medicine has a history of several decades in China, due to the backwardness of culture, traditional medicine and witch doctors who beg for help from gods and ghosts are still ubiquitous. Although these phenomena will disappear after a considerable period of time, too many people are dying unjustly and the losses are too great. Therefore, in addition to promoting scientific medicine, we must also help the public to break superstitions and metaphysical claims.

Based on the above positions, we have opened this special column. Here we do not introduce which doctor treats which disease, or which disease should be treated with which product of which company. These are not our concerns. We will gradually introduce the concept of scientific medicine and effective methods for preventing disease and maintaining health.

Under our sacred mission, we will do our best to fight for human health. This special column is a bridge between us and the public. Although the space is small, the aspirations are grand. We deeply hope that our colleagues will join us and that all sectors of society will provide guidance. Then the colleagues will be fortunate, and society will be fortunate.

### The Pathogen of Cholera

— Yang Shuya

True cholera is an acute infectious disease of the gastrointestinal tract. Its origin is the Ganges Delta in India. Since 1817, it has spread around the world through sea and land transportation. At that time, the medical community did not know what its pathogen was. It was not until 1883 that Robert Koch, the president of the research association organized by the German government, went to Egypt and India to conduct on-the-spot investigations. He personally examined the feces of many cholera patients and dissected the intestines of those who died from the disease. Under the microscope, he discovered a unique curved bacterium, and rigorous scientific experiments proved that it was the pathogen of cholera. He then named it Vibrio cholerae. Later, after research by bacteriologists from various countries, it was also confirmed that Koch's discovery was correct.

The Vibrio cholerae is very small (only 1.5×3 μm) and cannot be seen without a microscope. However, it multiplies extremely rapidly in the human body and produces toxins, which often lead to serious diseases - cholera. Cholera patients spread the bacteria to the outside world through vomiting and diarrhea. Feces and vomit contain the bacteria, and water, food, flies, etc. contaminated by them can also have their traces. Because of its small size, people cannot see it and do not know how to prevent it. Its harm to humans is even greater than that of poisonous snakes and beasts.

Vibrio cholerae is very ferocious, but it cannot withstand heat. All bacteria contained in food and drinks can be killed by boiling them. Chemical substances such as lime milk and bleaching powder can also kill the bacteria, so they can be used to disinfect feces and vomit.

### Symptoms of Cholera

— Dai Ziying

The period from when food or drink contaminated with cholera bacteria enters the body to the onset of symptoms is very short, ranging from a few hours to five or six days. This is the incubation period. During an epidemic, the severity of the symptoms varies depending on the individual's resistance, the number of bacteria, the acidity of the gastric juice, and the season. Mild symptoms may include mild diarrhea, occasional vomiting, and mild collapse, which will heal in one or two days. Severe symptoms may include dry cholera, which can cause death within a few hours of onset, before diarrhea and vomiting have even occurred, due to severe toxicity. Common general symptoms can be roughly divided into three stages.

(1) Initial Stage: May or may not occur. Those with milder symptoms often have one or two days of mild diarrhea, accompanied by symptoms such as vomiting, abdominal pain, headache, and mental fatigue. The stool is a yellow liquid.

(2) Dehydration Stage: Lasts from about two or three hours to twenty-four hours. The symptoms in this stage can be summarized as being caused by dehydration in the body. During this stage, the number of diarrheal episodes increases sharply, followed by frequent vomiting, which can occur dozens of times in an hour. The patient's eyeballs are sunken, the cheeks are emaciated, the bridge of the nose is high, the voice is hoarse, the breathing is short, the lips are dry, the pulse is fast and weak, the skin is cyanotic and cold, the leg muscles are cramped, and the fingertips are wrinkled. Some of these are commonly referred to as "hanging foot sha" and "deflated snail sha," which are not different from ordinary cholera, but are a deeper manifestation of dehydration. The amount of urine is extremely reduced or even completely absent. The skin loses its inherent elasticity. If the skin on the back of the hand is pinched with two fingers and lifted up, the skin of a normal person will return to its original state after being released, but this is not the case for patients. It will remain raised for a long time before slowly returning. During this stage, the patient may die due to the worsening of the symptoms and entering a coma, or the condition may improve and enter the recovery stage. Without proper treatment, the mortality rate is about 40%. During the collapse stage, the stool has a unique rice-water appearance or is a grayish-white precipitate. This is because it no longer contains feces and is composed purely of protein, mucus, cholera bacteria, and epithelial bacteria.

(3) Reaction Stage: About half or more of the patients enter this stage. During this stage, the frequency of bowel movements and vomiting decreases sharply, or even constipation occurs. The skin changes from cyanotic to ruddy, and the voice changes from hoarse to loud. Body temperature rises, and breathing and heart function gradually return to normal. There are no more muscle cramps or wrinkled fingertips. The most important thing is the restoration of kidney function, so that urine excretion returns to normal. If this is the case, good health can be expected soon. Otherwise, the patient will return to a dangerous state, entering a state similar to typhoid fever, and dying of uremic coma (the mortality rate of uremia is 15%).

### Actions That Should Be Taken by Families After Cholera Occurs

— Wang Linsheng

(1) Immediately escort the patient to the nearest cholera hospital or epidemic prevention hospital for diagnosis and treatment. This is because the treatment of this disease requires rapid intravenous injection of saline to replenish the body's water and dilute the toxins of the bacteria. At this critical moment in the patient's life, do not try using secret recipes or over-the-counter medicines to harm yourself.

(2) The patient's excrement (including feces and vomit, etc.) and clothing are all attached with cholera bacteria, which is a major hazard in the transmission of cholera. They should be disinfected strictly and promptly to prevent new cases from arising. The house and bed where the patient lives should also be washed and sprinkled with lime water to curb its spread. The person who does the washing must be careful to prevent contracting the disease. Do not put your fingers in the water.

(3) Flies are one of the vectors for spreading cholera and should be killed. It is best to spray them with a reliable DDT solution, and especially eliminate their breeding grounds. Food should be protected and not exposed to flies.

(4) If a family member unfortunately dies of cholera, the corpse should be covered with a cloth soaked in a 20-fold solution of carbolic acid and placed in a tightly sealed coffin. The burial should be simple and public mourning should be prohibited. Cremation is best if possible.

(5) Since cholera is a disease that enters through the mouth, raw water, unclean fruits, and raw vegetables should not be eaten casually. Hands must be washed before meals. Careless drinking and eating are also factors that induce the transmission of this disease and should be avoided.

(6) If there are suspected patients, they should be immediately sent to the hospital for diagnosis, treatment, and isolation, so as not to delay treatment for oneself or spread the disease to others. It benefits both oneself and others, so why not do it?

(7) Family members who have not yet been vaccinated should go to medical and health authorities as soon as possible to receive preventive injections.

### Saltwater Injections and Other Treatments for Cholera

— Zhang Changshao

The most important treatment for cholera is administering saltwater injections. Of course, some doctors also prefer to administer various expensive injectable medications, such as heart stimulants, which are naturally very expensive, but not necessarily essential. The latest methods also employ sulfonamide drugs, but if saltwater injections are not administered and only sulfonamide drugs are used, it is not only ineffective but also harmful. Therefore, among all cholera treatments, saltwater injections are the most important and indispensable.

As everyone knows, blood is the most precious substance in the body. The nutrients required by every cell in the body must be supplied directly or indirectly by the blood. The waste products that cells do not need must also be collected and eliminated by the blood. However, blood must be a flowing liquid to circulate throughout the body and perform its functions. Cholera patients experience vomiting and diarrhea, losing a large amount of water from their bodies. As a result, the blood becomes thick and circulation fails. This is the most dangerous symptom of cholera patients. A small number of cholera patients, even if they do not vomit or have diarrhea, can experience the same result if the water in their blood flows into their tissues. This "dehydration" phenomenon is the most important pathological phenomenon of cholera and the main cause of death from cholera. It must be corrected immediately in treatment. Administering saltwater injections is currently the only known effective method.

By injecting saltwater into the veins, the water lost within the body can be replenished, restoring its normal fluidity, and circulation can be restored accordingly. As a result, many symptoms of cholera, such as sunken eyes, cramps, loss of voice, and collapse, which are signs of impending death, quickly disappear. However, vomiting and diarrhea sometimes do not stop. If vomiting and diarrhea persist, water continues to be lost, so saltwater injections must be continued every few hours until there is no longer a significant loss of water.

However, administering saltwater injections is not an easy procedure. The preparation of saltwater must be based on the latest scientific principles and employ strict techniques; otherwise, various reactions may occur after the injection, and these reactions can sometimes be life-threatening. Saltwater injections also need to be administered by well-trained personnel to ensure that the injection rate and dosage are neither excessive nor insufficient.

Recently, it has been discovered that ordinary water contains a pyrogen, called Progen in English. Even distilled water, chemicals, and ordinary glassware often contain this substance. If saltwater and other injectable medications contain this substance, intravenous injection often causes various reactions such as chills, fever, headache, and vomiting, sometimes endangering life. Ordinary sterilization methods cannot eliminate this pyrogen. In the past, distilled water and saltwater on the market contained a large amount of pyrogen, so reactions occurred after saltwater injections. Now, a special method has been invented to remove pyrogens from the water. Therefore, it is hoped that pharmacies will provide pyrogen-free distilled water and hospitals will use pyrogen-free saltwater to reduce the suffering and danger to patients.

Secondly, most cholera patients not only have "dehydration," but also "acidosis." Therefore, they not only need saltwater but also alkaline components. In the past, this point was often overlooked, so patients often died of acidosis after being saved from dehydration. Adding alkaline components to saltwater is not simple. Sodium bicarbonate is naturally a good alkaline component, but it cannot be sterilized by ordinary methods after being added. If sodium lactate is used, the preparation method is relatively easier.

Previously, there were reports in the United States and our country of using sulfonamide drugs to treat cholera. Before using sulfonamides, saltwater injections must first be administered to replenish the water in the blood and restore kidney function; otherwise, serious reactions are likely to occur. The use of sulfonamides may reduce the mortality rate of cholera. The best sulfonamide currently known is sulfathiazole.

### Beware of Cholera: Disease Enters Through the Mouth!!!

— Qiao Shumin

The terrifying cholera, also known as "tiger cholera," has reappeared this year!

"Turning pale at the mention of a tiger" is not necessary. We need to investigate: how does this cholera come about? What methods are there to defeat it?

"Know yourself and know your enemy, and you will win every battle." What is cholera all about? It turns out that the feces and vomit of cholera patients (or carriers) contain countless cholera vibrios. These vibrios, through some route of transmission—water, food, flies, fingers, tableware, etc.—enter the mouths of other people and cause illness in their stomachs. These people then become patients and can infect others. If this spreads rapidly, the death toll will be staggering.

Now that we have investigated the origins and paths of cholera, we do not need to worry about not having strategies to deal with it. There are three strategies: First, "eliminate the enemy where it comes from." Cholera vibrios come from the feces or vomit of patients, so we must thoroughly disinfect the feces and vomit to prevent cholera vibrios from escaping. This is the best policy, most thorough, most effective, and most important. What method can be used to disinfect? The most convenient and reliable method is to immediately add an equal amount of lime (lump lime) to the feces or vomit, mix it thoroughly, and then pour it into a deep pit or bury it in the soil. If bleaching powder is available, it is even better than lime. Are there cholera patients in your house or your neighbor's house? If not, please raise your awareness and pay close attention. Once there is a cholera patient, then please quickly use the above method to disinfect the feces and disinfect the vomit. This basic step is not too troublesome and concerns your own life and safety, so please do not be careless.

However, it is not certain that every patient's family will disinfect in this way, and it is not certain that everyone will do it perfectly. Perhaps cholera vibrios have already invaded your drinking water, invaded your food, attached to the feet of flies, or attached to your tableware or fingers. What should be done? Therefore, we must also adopt the second strategy—cut off their transmission routes.

What routes should be cut off? First, water is the most important. If disinfected tap water is available, that is good. If river water or well water is used, then the water source should be strictly protected to prevent pollution. In any case, it is absolutely forbidden to drink raw water, and it is also forbidden to wash fruits with raw water or use raw water to rinse bowls or gargle. In short, everything that is drunk, eaten, or used that enters the mouth must be boiled water to ensure safety.

Secondly, food that contains raw water, such as sour plum soup, Dutch water, and jelly, should not be eaten. Even other things must be eaten cooked. Melon slices or food that flies have passed over may carry attached cholera vibrios. Fingertips touching this and that may also carry bacteria. In the final analysis, you must be careful about what you put in your mouth and not allow any food or drink that may carry cholera vibrios to enter your mouth. As the saying goes, "Disease enters through the mouth." If you guard this important port, cholera vibrios cannot attack from the skin or the orifices of the eyes, ears, nose, or mouth.

If the above articles can be strictly implemented, you can rest easy. However, human society has frequent contact, and general environmental hygiene is very lacking. During this cholera epidemic, a slight carelessness can lead to infection. Therefore, the last line of defense should also be adopted, which is the third strategy for dealing with cholera.

The third strategy is preventative inoculation—getting vaccinated—to enhance our body's ability to resist cholera vibrios. This is called "immunity." It means that if a small amount of cholera vibrios invades the human body, the body of a person who has been vaccinated can resist it, with the hope of defeating the bacteria and avoiding the epidemic. However, all immunity in the world is relative. You must not rely on having been vaccinated and think that you are insured. Reckless eating and drinking are still dangerous.

Frankly speaking, cholera, as an infectious disease, is absolutely preventable. In civilized countries in Europe and America, cholera has long been eradicated. In China, it occurs once every two or three years, and the cities with deaths are becoming more and more crowded. This must be considered a great shame for the nation.

### The Rong Case

— Shao Fu

The Rong Desheng case was resolved with more than 300,000 US dollars, which can be confirmed by the emergency order issued by the police yesterday to pay attention to the serial numbers of the US dollar bills printed by the police.

We have two thoughts about this incident:

First, the Rong family did not cooperate with the public security authorities; second, the public security authorities failed to handle the matter impartially.

During the period from Rong Desheng's kidnapping to his release and return, his contacts and negotiations with the bandits were kept secret. The public security authorities not only failed to obtain any reference information or clues from the Rong family, but were misled by many mysteries, and even deceived into announcing that Rong's escape from the bandits' den was due to the bandits being forced by police detectives to release him automatically, without paying any price;

The public security authorities naturally did not want to be partial and sing the same tune as the Rong family. They stopped pursuing the matter because they were afraid of hurting the rats while throwing stones at the china. However, after a prominent person spoke out, they had to relax a step and did not punish the Rong family for sheltering the bandits in accordance with the law, which we regret very much.

As a result, the bandits are still at large.

If the course of events was exactly the opposite of the above, I am afraid that not only would the Rong case criminals be apprehended sooner, but those who commit crimes in the future would not dare to try it so easily.

### Record of the Trial of Mo Guokang, Concubine of the Traitor Chen Gongbo

— Zhang Ming

"If a traitor is a woman, she must be overwhelmingly charming, with sensual and fleshy curves," everyone thinks. Therefore, the first female traitor tried by the Capital High Court became the target of everyone's aspirations.

She did not have a husband and had never been formally married, but she was the concubine of the traitor Chen Gongbo. Naturally, in terms of sentiment and reason, there would inevitably be some scandalous history involved.

Imagine how attractive this topic was! Therefore, the Capital High Court on the 3rd was like a wedding, with throngs of people from the courtyard to the courtroom. Among them were also some compatriots who stayed in the occupied area, who had endured the humiliation under the power of the invaders. Today, they came out of excitement, wanting to see her "have such a day too"!

When the judges took their seats, Mo Guokang was also escorted in. Naturally, the first impression was a bit abrupt, because she was not only not monstrous, but also not charming. She was wearing a neatly ironed light blue printed Dan cloth gown, a pair of black flat leather shoes, her hair was not permed, it was short, her face was clearly southern, her eyes were bright and piercing, her skin was slightly dark, and she was extremely calm and natural when she entered the court.

When her experience was questioned, the first question that was touched on was her relationship with Chen, the traitor. The judge questioned her in various ways, but did not say directly, "When did you become Chen's concubine?" So she kept evading, saying things like "We have a teacher-student relationship," "I took care of him," and so on. When asked when she met Chen, she quickly said, "Between 1924 and 1926." How did they meet? "He was once my teacher. At the same time, he followed Mr. Liao Zhongkai and participated in the National Revolution, and often went in and out of Mr. Liao's residence. I also often went to Mr. Liao's residence, so I met him." Therefore, later "I took care of him," "did some private things for him." In short, very casually, very subtly, Mo Guokang became Chen's concubine.

When asked how she went to Nanjing, she said: "At the end of April 1939, because Guangzhou was lost and my family was scattered, I wanted to go back to find my family, so I went to Shaoguan to Hong Kong and lived there for eleven months. During that period, I read and wrote literary works, which introduced the anti-Japanese war in the front."

Why did she go to Nanjing again? She said: "Mr. Chen asked me to come. Originally, Mr. Chen was not willing to, but because Mr. Wang insisted that he go, he had no choice but to go. Because I was used to taking care of Mr. Chen, Mr. Chen wanted me to go, and I had no choice but to go."

"I went to Shanghai in early April and stayed for a few days before going to Nanjing. At that time, Chen was already the President of the Legislative Yuan, and I went in to be an editor." "From October 1940, I became a member of the Legislative Yuan until the Nanjing government was dissolved."

"The facts about the Political Security Department are like this: I started working at the department in April 1945, first as a counselor, and later I was ordered to work in the confidential office." When asked if she was acting for Chen, the Director-General, she said, "Absolutely not. I mostly helped him with his private affairs. I do not review official documents, and I am a weak woman who is often sick, how can I do these things? Later, I left the Political Security Department because of my poor health."

Regarding the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty and the Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Joint Declaration, which were passed by the puppet Legislative Yuan and harmed China, she said: "I did not participate in the parliament. At the same time, it was submitted by the Central Political Committee, and it was specified that not a single word could be changed, so the Legislative Yuan was not responsible. As for the Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Joint Declaration, I was unhappy when I saw the word 'Manchukuo'." She said it so well that everyone should believe her lies.

The Presiding Judge asked her, "Do you know that these treaties would lead to the destruction of China?" She said, "I have not studied them, and I have not expressed my approval."

Then, she repeatedly stated that she did not go to Tokyo to "escape punishment," but because Chen went to Japan. "I was used to taking care of him, and the situation in Nanjing was very chaotic at that time. Mr. Chen was afraid that I would be in danger, so he asked me to go with him, and I went."

Naturally, Mo Guokang, who was standing on the defendant's stand, did not know that Chen had already been executed in Suzhou that morning. So when the Presiding Judge asked her, "Chen Gongbo has been sentenced to death, what are your thoughts?" She laughed and pretended to be so nonchalant, and said, "My thought is that he sacrificed himself for his friends." She was still defending Chen.

She was a member of the puppet Legislative Yuan and the Director of the Confidential Office of the puppet Political Security Department. She exercised the powers of the Director-General of the Political Security Department, Chen, a traitor. The Political Security Department was a special agent organization. She denied: "I have not handled official business for Mr. Chen, I only did private things for him." She also said: "I look at official documents, but do not approve them." Why did she have to look at them? She said, "Because the special agents and Mr. Chen have nothing to do with each other, so I have to go in and take a look for him." At first, she denied not understanding that the department was a special agent organization, and now she confessed it herself. In the end, she also submitted an official document, which was submitted to Chen by her, saying that this could prove that I did not "decide on behalf of him."

There is also a contradictory point in the confession, that is, at first, she said that she worked in the Legislative Yuan in order to earn a salary to maintain her life, but when asked what rank she was paid at, she denied: "I have never received a salary, really, I have never received a salary." Then this means that I did not personally handle the official payment, but as the concubine of the Director-General, it was certainly convenient to withdraw money at any time.

When asked if she was married, she said, "I am not married." Everyone laughed, but she was very serious!

Finally, she still boasted about her achievements. First, she said, "I have always adhered to two principles: one is not to criticize the anti-Japanese war, because I agree with the anti-Japanese war; one is not to criticize the supreme leader, and at the same time to assist the comrades who are sent from the rear to work in Nanjing and Shanghai." After this, she gave many examples, such as Chen Lin of the Military Intelligence Bureau, Wu Huaqun of the Third War Zone, anyway, it was all unverifiable, a debt out of nowhere. It's always good to talk about it. She also talked about relieving the suffering of the people.

This set of traitor theory lasted for more than ten minutes, and she spoke with laughter, her attitude was quite "that."

Regarding the indictment, she argued with several points: (1) Various regulations and treaties were sent by the Central Political Committee and could only be passed without the right to change them, especially the Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Joint Declaration, which was designated not to change a single word. (2) Regarding the alleged acting for the Director-General of the Political Security Department, Mr. Chen never asked for leave, there was no need to act for him, and I am a woman who is often sick, how can I act as the Director-General? (3) Going to Japan was because I had been taking care of Mr. Chen for many years, and Mr. Chen asked me to go, I could not refuse, it was not to escape punishment. (4) Contacting anti-Japanese war comrades and relieving the suffering of the people were all facts.

"I have not done anything that is detrimental to the country, detrimental to the people, or detrimental to the anti-Japanese war."

"To be a friend to the end,"

And she smiled very reluctantly.

Thus, the court announced that the verdict would be pronounced at 10 a.m. on the 10th.

### Snake

— Translated by Bao Zhiying

Mine Clearance Device

The U.S. Army Operations Department recently announced a new type of weapon called the "Snake." This weapon was used extensively by the Allied forces on the European battlefield to clear many mines buried by the Axis forces, allowing tank units to enter enemy positions without danger.

The "Snake" is a metal, narrow, linear container with two flat, linear, explosive fuse gates wrapped between curved aluminum plates. After being screwed together, it can be pushed forward by light or medium tanks to detonate landmines. The weapon is 400 feet long, 14 inches wide, and 5 inches high, weighing approximately 9,000 pounds, but half of the load is the weight of high explosives.

The "Snake" has a chisel-like nose at the front, guiding its narrow body through rugged roads or mountains. Oval-shaped special ammunition is placed inside the narrow device, each spaced approximately two and a half feet apart. The machine gun fire from the advancing tank can ignite the fuse and cause an explosion.

To avoid competitive destruction, this weapon is mostly used at night. The "Snakes," operating in large numbers in the fields, are disguised and protected by grass and sandbags, and advance at a rate of two miles per hour.

### Younger Sister, I Love You, Good Boy, Long De Dong

Yesterday at a friend's banquet, after drinking, we talked about clever couplets. One gentleman told a couplet, although it was appreciated by both the refined and the vulgar, and the words were wonderful, it was improper and cruel. The couplet is as follows:

Back in the day, Younger Sister, I Love You;

To this day, Good Boy, Long De Dong.

### Candle Rice Merchant, No Light, No Bright

— Feng Yi

The food loan that has been causing a stir in the city, its wide-ranging involvement, its scope, and the tortuous and strange nature of the case, have many things that cannot be told to outsiders.

Wu Rongsheng, the manager of San Tai Rice Shop, is currently being detained in a military organization in the western district, and is not allowed to meet with his family. Even the food sent by his family must be sent to the hospital for testing before being allowed to be eaten. It is said that there are two reasons for this: first, it is feared that after meeting with his family, he will "leak secrets," "seek avenues," "make gestures," and cause changes in the middle. Second, it is feared that poison will be placed in the food to commit suicide and create a "headless case."

It is also heard that Wu Rongsheng once asked a prominent person and a rice industry tycoon to request bail, but was rejected.

In addition to rice shops, many "companies with strong backing" that are suspected of being involved in this food loan are being investigated. The company of a certain young master is mostly involved in buying and selling short, so there is no concrete evidence to investigate. However, the evidence against Changjiang Company is conclusive, so there are three people, including the manager Wang Xunzhi, who have been detained.

When the government repeatedly stated its determination to stabilize food prices, rice merchants mostly adopted a wait-and-see attitude, thinking that they could still get away with it. After the Changjiang Company incident, they realized that the government's actions this time were not just talk, and seeing that the military organization was also assisting in the investigation, they knew that they were facing a life-and-death situation. As a result, the rice merchants became fearful, and the price of rice automatically trended downwards. The Shanghai people say "candle opener, no light, no bright," which is a fitting description.

Shi Licheng, the chairman of the Securities Industry Association, recently commented on the fact that American goods are suddenly cheaper than domestic goods, believing that this unbalanced situation is like "a broken game of Go, becoming one-sided," and his words were full of sadness.

Song Hanzhang's deafness and Bei Songsun's lameness can be called the two wonders of the Chinese financial world. Bei's way of doing things has the style of an entrepreneur, not perfunctory, no official airs, handling finances, reviewing official documents, the brain and hand are in sync, and the decisions are quick, so the subordinates are all convinced.

A Collection of Brief Remarks

### Special Commissioner vs. Tea Boy

— Wuling Person

All the staff of the Shanghai Office of the Executive Yuan submitted a letter to Director Jiang, generally saying that all the staff would rather be tea boys than special commissioners or section chiefs. The reason is that the monthly income of the staff is only more than 100,000 yuan, while the salary of the tea boys is calculated according to the cost of living index, reaching more than 200,000 yuan per month. In this case, the Dragon Boat Festival bonus, which cannot be avoided this time, seems to have to be reversed, fortunately, there is no longer any talk of superiority and inferiority in front of us.

Among the members of the Association of Comrades in Distress, there is Yin Dingyi, who was reported as a traitor and prosecuted after investigation confirmed the suspicion of crime and the court opened for interrogation. During the trial, Yin's wife presented the certificate of the Association of Comrades in Distress as evidence that membership requires qualification review, and the prosecutor's prosecution must also be investigated in advance; Is this the confusion of the qualification reviewers of the Association of Comrades in Distress, or is the prosecutor's prosecution improper? Let's see in the future.

The traitors in the "Loyalty" prison received gifts from their families as usual during the Dragon Boat Festival, and enjoyed seasonal delicacies. At the same time, more than 200 righteous people are asking the authorities for relief.

A large number of Japanese aircraft, which have been piled up in the Jiang Airport for a long time and eroded by wind, rain and scorching sun, are no longer in shape, will be dismantled and sold by the kilogram. The United States also has a large number of bombers, reconnaissance aircraft, etc. that will be sold as scrap iron. Is this a symbol of world peace, turning hostility into friendship?

Living in Chongqing is full of resentment, returning to Shanghai is full of suffering, being an official can make a fortune, doing business can also make a fortune, you always have to think of a way, can't you just starve to death here?

### Democratic Bra

— Zisu

A certain gentleman completed a cartoon, which is a half-naked lady with a bra on her chest; On the bra, the words "democracy" were written, and the title was "Miss Democracy, you are having romantic luck!"

Some people criticized him for being immoral, because democracy is not a "romantic luck" lady, nor is it a prostitute who sells her body.

But in my opinion, it is quite thought-provoking. People take food as their heaven, let alone in this era of rice as pearls and firewood as cinnamon, when babies are waiting to be fed, the first thing they ask for from their mothers is of course breast milk. Although the American-made "Kerning milk powder" is everywhere now, milk powder is always not as good as breast milk, and the price of milk powder is not very cheap. After all, only rich people are worthy of enjoying it. In the eyes of poor boys, it is a luxury, so they are looking forward to breast milk even more! We hope that the arrival of democracy is as urgent as an infant waiting to be fed!

It is a pity that there is still a pair of bras covering democracy, which is hoped for but unattainable. I don't know when we will have democratic milk to suck, so that "Kerning milk powder" will not be available on the market. Borrowing an old poem, this is exactly called "I always feel a layer of soul". We are still some distance away from true democracy. How can we not feel "disappointed" by this "beautiful figure"?

We don't want Miss Democracy to have romantic luck and become a private plaything; We want to protect her, help her drive away mad bees and wild butterflies, and hope that she will become everyone's mother, so that we can all have milk to eat! (Editor's note: The painting was published in the eleventh issue of the "Xinwen Tiandi" monthly magazine)

### Reply to Readers: Legal Questions

Loyal Reader asks Editor: There is A (male) who was engaged to B (female) before the War of Resistance Against Japan. When the war broke out, A was trapped due to his job and moved west to Chengdu with the agency. B lived in the seaside area. Due to environmental and economic reasons, A could not go to B's place to get married, and B was the same. After a few years, B stayed in her boudoir for a long time and is now thirty-three years old. However, it was found that A actually married C (female) in Chengdu in the last few years and had children. Recently, A has come to Shanghai and denied that he married C, and intends to marry B. Now there are several questions as follows:

(1) A married C without marrying B. Is there any violation of the law? Is it bigamy? Which article of which law is violated? Please record the original text. (2) A has not terminated the engagement with B, and officially married C. Does C have any legal status? Is C legal? (3) If A does not break off the relationship with C, but denies to B that there is C, and then marries B, is A guilty of bigamy? Does C have the right to sue? (4) If A does not break off the relationship with C, but only denies to B that there is C, and then marries B, what will be the relationship between B and C in the future? Who is the eldest? Or who is the eldest? Because B was engaged first, she should be regarded as the original wife, and C married first, and can also be regarded as priority? (5) How many years of cohabitation between men and women can be legally recognized as husband and wife? (6) Assuming that the length of cohabitation between A and C has reached the legal requirements and can be considered as husband and wife, then what is B's status? (7) Now A denies that there is C. If he marries B, and then C appears, what is C's legal status and rights? (8) If the other party has bigamy, within how many years should the victim file a lawsuit? During the period of traffic interruption and communication difficulties, before the facts have been confirmed, is this time limit valid? (9) B is now old and cannot be self-sufficient. If A is obstructed by C and does not marry B, B will be greatly harmed. If the engagement has not been married for a long time, has A violated the law? Which law is violated? Is B called abandoned? What legal rights does B have? Can she request compensation and alimony, etc.? (10) How is the current fee calculated? Is it based on the cost of living index? (11) A conceals that he is married to C and is willing to marry B. What legal procedures should B go through before she can marry A? And what legal procedures can make the relationship between C and A invalid? Or make it a natural severance of the relationship, without legal effect?

Please answer the above points in detail.

[Lawyer Chuan Kuanglin's reply] (1) A does not constitute the crime of bigamy, but B can legally terminate the engagement with A and request compensation. (2) If A and C's marriage has a public ceremony and two or more witnesses, C is A's legal spouse. (3) If A marries B again, he will be guilty of bigamy, and C has the right to sue. (4) C should be recognized as the legal spouse, and interested parties may request the revocation of B and A's marriage. (5) There is no such provision in the law. (6) If A and C only have cohabitation facts and have not held a public ceremony, then the marital relationship between A and C cannot be recognized as established according to law. A can still marry B without committing bigamy. (7) It should be judged based on whether A and C are formally married or only in a cohabitation relationship. (8) The crime of bigamy in Article 237 of the Criminal Law is a crime that can only be prosecuted upon complaint. It can be prosecuted before the statute of limitations for prosecution has expired (the statute of limitations for prosecution of this crime is ten years). (9) A does not constitute the crime of abandonment. A and B are not married yet, and B cannot request alimony, but B can legally claim to terminate the engagement with A and request compensation for damages. (10) There is no fixed standard for the calculation of the amount of compensation for damages. It is determined by the court based on the parties' request. (11) If A and C are only in a cohabitation relationship, they are ultimately not husband and wife. If A and C are formally married, there is no way to break away except for divorce.
