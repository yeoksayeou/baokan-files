### Chairman's Proclamation to the National Compatriots: Pointing Out the Crux of the Current Situation and Encouraging Joint Efforts for Restoration and Construction

[Central News Agency, Kuling, 13th] Chairman Chiang Kai-shek recently issued a proclamation to the national compatriots, the full text of which is as follows:

National compatriots, it has been exactly one year since Japan unconditionally surrendered to our Allied nations. On this day last year, I pointed out that "post-war restoration and construction will be more arduous than during the war." At that time, I believed that first, a peaceful, unified, and stable environment must be created so that the suffering people can recuperate, and the restoration and construction can be smoothly implemented. Now, a year has passed, and the government still adheres to this unchanged policy. However, contrary to expectations, the country's difficulties have not lessened, the people's suffering has not been relieved, and reflecting on the past and looking to the future, I truly feel a heavy responsibility and countless emotions. Therefore, I want to review the past year, point out to the compatriots the crux of the current situation, and encourage my compatriots to have a unified understanding and joint efforts.

The Communist Army's Destruction of Economic Arteries Causes the Current Serious Situation

Immediately following the victory of the War of Resistance, our primary task was demobilization, which meant restoring the state from wartime to peacetime. In the past year, the government returned from Chongqing, the wartime capital, to Nanjing. The laws restricting people's freedom during the war were revoked or revised. The work of reorganizing the national army has been implemented on schedule, and thousands of military officers have retired. Universities that had relocated to the interior are gradually reopening. Devastated cities are being rebuilt, and damaged dikes are being actively constructed. In areas not disturbed by the Communist Party, transportation arteries such as the entire Guangdong-Hankou Railway have been repaired and completed. Disaster areas are being provided with relief. Popularly elected councils at the provincial and county levels are being continuously promoted. Especially this year, there has been a widespread bumper harvest of agricultural products throughout the country, and the post-war famine is expected to be alleviated. As for fiscal and economic aspects, since March of this year, the amount of legal tender issued has gradually decreased, and by July, the amount issued had not increased. This is the result of the joint efforts and hard work of our government and people in recovering various regions over the past year. Other demobilization tasks that have not reached the expected goals still await our national unity, intensified efforts, and continued promotion. Of course, there are many more.

However, judging from the progress and process of demobilization over the past year, we are truly filled with endless regrets. The most serious current phenomenon is stagnant production, economic imbalance, high prices, and difficult living conditions. The most important reason is the disruption of transportation, which prevents the smooth flow of the national economy's arteries. Although our Yangtze River and coastal waterways are open to navigation, the number of ships is still insufficient. Although the Guangdong-Hankou and Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Railways are open to traffic, the main lines of the Beijing-Hankou, Tianjin-Pukou, Jiaoji, and Longhai economic arteries have been destroyed and blocked by the Communist army. As a result, industrial centers are experiencing raw material shortages, while agricultural and mineral products have no market. Commercial ports are piling up with goods, while the vast interior lacks supplies. This has created a situation of rampant speculative capital and impoverished people. In addition, certain areas occupied by the Communist Party have blockaded food supplies, arbitrarily issued paper money, exploited the local population, and isolated transportation, forming independent economic units. Consequently, the disintegration of the national economic organization has increased unexpected and unpredictable difficulties in stabilizing prices, relieving people's livelihoods, carrying out demobilization, and restoring production. This is the problem we are deeply concerned about and striving to solve.

Political Evolution Over the Past Seven Months Proves that Hopes Have Become Illusions

Examining the biggest crux of the various difficulties mentioned above, it still lies in the fact that domestic political disputes cannot be resolved, the order of peace has been greatly undermined, and the people's minimum demand for a peaceful and prosperous life cannot be realized. Of course, there is even less talk of increasing production and developing the economy. Since the end of the War of Resistance last year, our government has established the policy of "national unification" and "political democracy," hoping to resolve party disputes through political means, unite under the common interests of the nation and people, and embark on the democratic constitutional path of peaceful construction. We knew that the Chinese Communist Party was not a party that followed the usual democratic methods, but rather possessed its own independent armed forces, independent administrative system, independent collection of people's taxes, and existed outside the government's orders. However, the government still made many efforts, hoping that it would abandon its prejudices of armed separation and transform into a peaceful and legal party, follow the path of democracy, and jointly promote construction. In this year, the government first held sincere talks with representatives of the Communist Party, and then invited representatives of various parties and social elites to hold a Political Consultative Conference, establishing five agreements. At the same time, the government and Communist Party representatives, with the assistance of Special Envoy Marshall, signed measures to cease conflict and restore transportation, and determined plans to reorganize the national army and incorporate the Communist army into the national army. These resolutions and plans were the crystallization of the government's painstaking efforts over the past year, and also the unanimous request of the people of the country. It can be said that the country's future and the people's happiness depended on whether these agreements and plans were implemented. Unfortunately, the evolution of the past seven months has proven that the hopes of our government and people have become illusions. The territory occupied by the Communist Party is expanding day by day, their demands are constantly increasing, agreements are being overturned, military mediation is not respected, and actions that undermine peace are increasing. This not only makes the people suffer and feel confused, but also makes it impossible for the government to carry out any demobilization measures. Everyone knows that China's internal and external environment cannot tolerate the recurrence of war, but any government in the world cannot abandon its responsibility to maintain the country's administrative sovereignty and protect the lives and property of the people.

### Future Policy for Handling the Current Situation

Speaking of this, I want to explain to my national compatriots the future policy of our National Government for handling the current situation. Our China has experienced this long and arduous War of Resistance, with devastated cities, exhausted villages, destroyed industry, and abandoned agriculture, like a person after a major illness, needing gentle and quiet nourishment and recuperation. Therefore, the government has always advocated peaceful solutions to domestic political problems. Within the limits of not violating the Three Principles of the People and not shaking the foundation of the country, it is willing to endure humiliation and bear heavy burdens, and be tolerant and yielding, in order to seek opportunities for recuperation and rest for all our compatriots. Even when the Communist Party repeatedly violated agreements and provoked conflicts, our government consistently respected the opinions of the Mediation Executive Headquarters and strictly implemented the provisions of the military reorganization plan. It has always adhered to the established agreements and signed plans, and will never overturn the agreements due to changes in the situation. All of these have been sufficiently proven by past facts. As for future policies, what can be clearly stated to my compatriots is:

(1) It will never delay the process of ending political tutelage and starting constitutional government due to any obstacles. The National Assembly on November 12 will definitely be convened as scheduled.

(2) It will sincerely abide by all the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and strive to promote them. Regarding the draft constitution, it only seeks to gather better opinions from all parties to provide to the National Assembly for discussion and decision, in order to create a perfect and feasible constitution.

(3) Regarding expanding the government's foundation and inviting people from various parties and non-party figures to participate, it will strive to achieve this as soon as possible, and use the Program for Peaceful National Construction as the guideline for governance.

(4) Regarding the cessation of conflict, it will still abide by the original agreement and faithfully fulfill it. Moreover, we do not require the Communist army to completely withdraw from the areas it has occupied since the ceasefire order, but only require it to withdraw from certain areas that have already posed a threat to peace and obstructed transportation.

(5) Regarding political disputes, it will still adopt political solutions. As long as the Communist Party's army faithfully implements the agreement to cease conflict and restore transportation, obeys mediation, and implements unification, so that the nationalization of the army does not become an empty promise, once this is guaranteed, the government can at any time hold concrete discussions with it on all unresolved issues.

(6) The people's most pressing demand at present is to live and work in peace and contentment, so the government must do its best to eliminate the threat to peace, and must also do its utmost to fulfill its duties to protect the lives, property, and safety of the people. The above-mentioned points are the essence of handling the current situation and are also the inescapable responsibility of the government. Chiang Kai-shek started the revolution in order to achieve national unification, relieve the suffering of compatriots, implement the Three Principles of the People, and create a democratic government to ensure the country's long-term stability and security. There is only a sense of responsibility and obligation, and there is absolutely no prejudice of gain or loss. As long as all parties can prioritize the interests of the nation and people, sincerely compete with each other, and the Communist Party can also consider the suffering of the people and show with facts its sincerity in implementing the agreement, then the obstacles to national construction will not be difficult to eliminate, and the difficulties of the current situation can be cleared away immediately.

### The Only Requirement of the Communist Party: Do Not Seize and Expand Territory by Armed Force; Use Political Means to Compete in Elections

Compatriots, let us calmly and quietly reflect on the past year. If there had been no disputes and turmoil in our country after the Japanese surrender, and the government's hope for peaceful unification could truly be achieved as scheduled, and armed parties no longer diverged and opposed the government, attempting to expand their territory and divide our country, then how glorious would our country's status and reputation be, how great would our nation's future and history be in the world, and how stable and happy would the lives of our societies and people be in various regions. To take a step back, even if the three agreements on ceasing conflict, restoring transportation, and reorganizing the army, which were signed by the government and the Communist Party in January this year, could be effectively implemented by the Communist Party on schedule and in accordance with the agreement, and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference could be sincerely fulfilled, and representatives could be elected to participate in the National Government and attend the National Assembly as scheduled, then the National Assembly could have been convened as scheduled three months ago, the country's constitution should have been formulated and promulgated, and the democratic politics of the Three Principles of the People could have achieved preliminary realization. How could it have come to this day, still suffering from the misunderstanding and ridicule of world public opinion, and the country still suffering such humiliation, and how could our compatriots suffer from the pain of the dikes collapsing and causing disasters in places such as Northern Jiangsu, Hebei, and Shandong? What I am saying is truly heartbreaking, but the past cannot be changed, but the future can be pursued. I still earnestly expect all parties to have the same reflection. How arduous was our eight-year War of Resistance, and how the victory was achieved through the sacrifices of soldiers and civilians. All of us in the country, no matter who we are, should cherish, maintain, promote, and glorify it, and must not lightly destroy it, so as not to ruin the foundation of the country. What China needs most today is nothing more than peaceful construction. This is also unanimously recognized and clearly expressed by the Communist Party. However, the progress of peaceful construction must be based on the common practice of democratic politics by all political parties. Do not possess autonomous armed forces outside the national army, and do not adopt the method of seizing political power by force to expand territory and divide the country, but use the method of political competition to compete in elections. Only in this way can a truly democratic government be established. Therefore, the plan to unify the Communist army into the national army must be implemented accordingly, and then the country will truly have the hope of peaceful unification and the implementation of democracy. What we ask of the Communist Party today is only one point: to change its policy of seizing political power by force, to transform the armed party into a peaceful party, not to have another disguised country within the country, so as not to hinder unification, and not to have an opposing army outside the national army, so as not to disturb peace. In short, the turbulent order within the country must be restored to normal, and the plan for peaceful construction can be carried out as scheduled. This is truly the key to resolving the crux of the current situation. It is also the minimum requirement that the government must make to the Communist Party for the sake of the country and the people, and I can assert that this is also the common and urgent expectation of the people of the country.

In short, the government's policy of peaceful resolution has always been consistent and will never change. The government will not neglect its original intention due to changes in the political situation or differences in party opinions regarding the established steps of implementing the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and implementing democratic constitutionalism. The government will do its best and expect the Communist Party to be sensible and increase the understanding of various parties. However, compatriots must also have a true and deep understanding of the current situation of the country and the responsibilities that the people should fulfill. Our China is originally a poor and backward country, and a semi-colonial country that has been subjected to the heavy shackles of imperialism for a hundred years. Now, it has just struggled out of this oppression. The internal and external troubles have been accumulating for a long time. The great cause of restoration cannot be achieved overnight. Today, we must eliminate turmoil, overcome difficulties, and build China into a peaceful, unified, democratic, and strong country. Not only government personnel must examine their shortcomings, be responsible and fulfill their duties, and be loyal to the country, but also all our compatriots need to have confidence, patience, patriotic enthusiasm, and a sincere heart to save the country, encourage each other, and work together.

[This Newspaper, Beiping, 13th] Marshal Ma seems extremely anxious about the Anping Incident. He has telegraphed the American member of the Executive Headquarters, Robertson, to go to Beijing on the 14th to report on the details and investigation of the Anping Incident. On the 13th, Robertson went to Xiyuan Airport to welcome Ambassador Stuart, and drove with him face to face toward the Yanjing Lakeside Villa, discussing the Anping Incident in secret for 45 minutes before leaving. The three members of the Executive Headquarters have still been unable to decide on the investigation procedure, so at the meeting of the 25-man group on the morning of the 13th, Davis declared that he had drafted a report describing the work of the group over the past week. If the government and the Communist Party agree, it can be signed as a group report. The government and the Communist Party agreed to consider it outside the meeting and respond at 9:00 a.m. on the 14th. There was no quarrel at the meeting on the 13th, and the atmosphere was more relaxed, which was the only time it has been seen in the past week's meetings.

### The First Anniversary of the Sino-Soviet Treaty: No Progress in Relations Between the Two Countries

[United Press, Nanjing, 13th] The 15th of this month marks the first anniversary of the establishment of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, but the relationship between China and its northern neighbor is still far from the letter and spirit of the treaty. According to the Chinese authorities, major concessions were made to the Soviet Union in the nine northeastern provinces when the 30-year agreement was signed, but it has been violated since the day it was signed. In the past year, Sino-Soviet relations have not only not improved but have also deteriorated, and there is no doubt that this situation is largely due to the military and political disputes between the Nationalists and Communists. Without resolving the Nationalist-Communist issue, there is little hope for improving Sino-Soviet relations. It has been confirmed in various ways that the Chinese Communists have received the full spiritual support of the Soviet Union. This fact plays an important role in every action to resolve the internal strife, and both the Nationalists and Communists are closely watching the Soviet Union's concern for this matter. The propaganda actions of the Chinese Communists are closely linked to Moscow's propaganda. Yan'an recently launched an anti-American campaign, and Moscow followed suit by shouting against American "interference" in China.

### Occupation Troops Sent to Japan Arrive in Shanghai via Hong Kong by Ship

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 13th] Dai Jian, the commander of the 67th Division of the National Army sent to Japan as an occupation force, led a part of the troops on two transports, "Haiti" and "Haichuan," and arrived in Hong Kong at 9:00 a.m. on the 13th, continuing to Shanghai at 6:00 p.m. the same evening.

### The Serious Situation in China Affects World Security: American Newspapers Comment on the Statement of Marshall and Stuart

[French News Agency, Washington, 12th] American newspapers commented on the joint statement of Marshall and Stuart, all agreeing that the statement implies that the serious situation in China affects the security of the entire world, not just China alone. The New York Times editorial, entitled "Dark Clouds Over China," vigorously stated that the darkness of China's future is nowhere as great as described in the joint statement of Marshall and Stuart. More than 400 million people in China will plunge into a civil war against their will at the cost of the entire economic collapse. Dark clouds are looming over China, and their shadow is passing through the world. The joint statement of Marshall and Stuart is almost a sign of the revision of our country's China policy. At this time, the tragic cry of the Chinese people may touch the hearts of the hardliners in Yan'an. As far as we know, the Nationalist Party represents four-fifths of the Chinese people, and the Communist Party is a minority faction, demanding equality or more than equality. When the conflict of authoritarianism is so great, anyone who wants to instill democratic consciousness will be in vain. Special Envoy Marshall has frankly admitted that nothing has been achieved. If we cancel aid to China, there will be little hope for tragic China.

The New York Herald Tribune said that the United States should do its best to prevent the current catastrophe, and even if Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart suffer all kinds of difficulties, they cannot discourage us.

Two Cartoons

[United Press, Washington, 12th] Today, American newspapers are still paying extraordinary attention to the Sino-American political stalemate. The newspapers all published dispatches on the front page, saying that Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart have clearly given up hope of promoting reconciliation between the Nationalists and Communists, and published articles and cartoons on the Chinese situation. The Washington Post published a cartoon on the front page entitled "The Cliff," depicting Marshall standing on the edge of a cliff, with the words "Failure of American Policy toward China" on the edge of the cliff. The Baltimore Sun also carried a cartoon depicting China being separated by a huge wall, with the words "Nationalist-Communist Dispute" written on the wall. Above it, a lonely figure, symbolizing "the Chinese people," is being whipped to the stake, with the words "The Threat of Civil War" written on the stake.

Hu Shi's View

[This Newspaper, Beiping, 12th] When reporters asked Hu Shi to express his views on the joint statement of Marshall and Stuart, Hu said that he hoped to see the original text of the statement, because the Central News Agency did not send a draft, and the translations in various newspapers were different, so he had not yet understood it, but he (Hu said of himself) has always advocated that the Communist Party should be determined to give up armed force and take the position of the largest party in opposition, then its future is unlimited, because a democratic country never allows two parties with armed forces to confront and fight for political power. The British Labour Party, which is now in power, only won 50,000 votes in the general election 50 years ago, but won the support of 92 million votes in the general election last year. When reporters asked Fu Sinian for an interview again, he repeatedly claimed to have a headache and refused to talk.

### The Communist Party Again Wants to Suggest Joint Mediation by Three Countries

[United Press, Nanjing, 13th] According to well-informed sources, the Communist Party will soon suggest that the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom jointly mediate the political stalemate in China. It is said that the Communist Party fears that when the National Army launches a full-scale offensive against them, the military situation will be unfavorable to them, so they want to win over the Soviet Union to strengthen their position.

### The University of Liège in Belgium Awards Chiang Kai-shek an Honorary Degree

### Ambassador Stuart Arrives in Beiping: Reportedly, Chairman Chiang Will Return to Nanjing at the End of the Month; Proclamation Will Likely Aid Peace

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] Ambassador Stuart arrived in Beiping this afternoon aboard a special Five-Star plane, accompanied by his advisor Chuan Jingbo and secretary Tao Luzhong. This trip to Beiping is to handle affairs at Yenching University; he will stay for about ten days before returning to Nanjing. This morning, the Ambassador spoke with Commander-in-Chief Ma twice and met with government representative Yu Dawei. It is reported that Mr. Yu personally requested that he continue his efforts and not be pessimistic, and expressed his intention to see him off. Mr. Yu visited Commander-in-Chief Ma before visiting the Ambassador. It is also rumored that Commander-in-Chief Ma may go to Lushan again tomorrow.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 13th] After arriving in Beiping, Ambassador Stuart Leighton denied to reporters that the Ma-Stuart joint statement was the death knell of negotiations and that Commander-in-Chief Ma was about to return home. He said: "The door to peace is not completely closed, and negotiations are expected to continue. He and Commander-in-Chief Ma, as in the past, have hope for peace in China." A reporter asked: "Can the joint statement provide better stimulus for the peace talks at Makou?" He replied: "Hopefully so." A reporter asked: "If the peace talks fail, will the United States change its China policy?" He replied: "It may be so at that time, but we do not want it to be so, and the current China policy has not changed." When reporters inquired about his opinion on the Anping Incident, the Ambassador declined to answer. The Ambassador said: "He is scheduled to return to Nanjing in a week. This trip to the north is to handle personal and university affairs." A reporter asked: "Having been running between Nanjing and Beiping for the past month, do you feel it is better to be an ambassador or a university president?" The Ambassador smiled and replied: "It is better to be a university president!" Someone asked: "Will the Executive Headquarters for Military Mediation be abolished?" The Ambassador replied: "No." The Commander-in-Chief Ma's Five-Star plane, which the Ambassador was on, departed Nanjing at 1:50 PM and arrived at Xiyuan Airport at 3:45 PM.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 13th] Ambassador Stuart said: "Chairman Chiang has a message that he will return to Nanjing before the end of the month." A reporter asked if Lushan was preparing to hold a national unity discussion on the current situation. The Ambassador said that he had not been informed of this. The Ambassador commented on Chairman Chiang's proclamation today: "Very good, very good. This proclamation will help peace."

### The Murder Suspect is an Active Duty Soldier; Trial to be Held Under Military Law; Gu Zhutong Has Sent the Entire Case to the Central Government by Telegram

[Central News Agency, Kunming, 13th] After the Yunnan Provincial Garrison Headquarters solved the murder case of Ge Yiduo, it submitted the suspect and the entire case file to Commander-in-Chief Gu for review. It is reported that Mr. Gu has carefully reviewed the entire file and, because the suspect is an active-duty soldier, the case will be handled according to military law. He has ordered the Military Law Department of the Army General Headquarters, the Yunnan Provincial Security Command, and the 13th Gendarmerie Regiment stationed in Kunming to each send personnel to form a joint trial court to hold a regular trial and has already sent a telegram to the Central Government regarding the matter. In order to make the case clear to the public, letters will be sent to invite representatives from Kunming and local agencies, Yunnan's people's representative organs at all levels, legal groups, and the Democratic League to observe the proceedings. As for the Li Gongpu case, Commander-in-Chief Gu has repeatedly ordered the Yunnan security organs responsible for maintaining order to step up their pursuit and solve the case and bring the perpetrators to justice in the shortest possible time.

### Communist Army Fiercely Attacks the Longhai Railway Line; Situation in Lanfeng City is Unclear; Garrison in Datong Receives Supplies by Air

[Our Dispatch, Xuzhou, 13th] It is reported that Kaifeng has been surrounded by the Communist army, and the artillery fire is fierce. It is reported that one staff member of the Executive Headquarters outside the city has been killed by a bullet, and another is seriously injured. All vehicles have been requisitioned by the military, and the UNRRA office has moved from outside the city to inside the city. No staff members have been killed or injured yet.

[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 13th] The Communist army in eastern Henan is actively attempting to cut the Longhai Railway. One unit of more than 10,000 people attacking Kaifeng concentrated its firepower on the 10th evening and launched another fierce attack on the city. The current situation in the city is unclear. On the 11th, Luo Wang, west of Kaifeng city, with 40 aircraft carrying reinforcements flew to Datong, which has improved the situation.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 13th] Five people, including Chen Tuanxing, from Datong, formed the "Shanxi Yanbei People's Petition Group" and came to Beiping on a convenient flight on the 11th to visit Director Li Zongren and requested urgent aid for the garrison's ammunition and food and to allow the people of Datong to take a convenient flight. At that time, Director Li agreed to do his best to assist and telegraphed the Central Government. According to Chen Guoxing and others, the Communist army began to attack Datong on the 5th, with a total of more than 30,000 people. The garrison has about 10,000 people, but only about half of them can fight. Currently, except for the Communist army in the southeast, which is two li away from the city, the rest are about five li away. The airport is still being held. The Datong railway station has been repeatedly shelled. There are about 100,000 residents in the city, and about 80-90% of those who lack food are hungry, and they eat tree bark. In addition, Ying County has been surrounded for 25 days, and the tragic situation is the same as in Datong. They have also asked Director Li for assistance. If there is no problem with ammunition and food, Datong can be defended for a month.

### Inspection of the Qiantang River Seawall Completed; Engineering Team Returns to Shanghai and Hangzhou; Report to be Prepared and Submitted for Discussion

[Our Jiaxing Dispatch, 13th] The Qiantang River Seawall Engineering Inspection Team, including Mao Yisheng and Wang Huzhen, left Haiyan for Jiaxing on the 13th. They had lunch at the Rain Pavilion of Nanhu Lake, and returned to Shanghai and Hangzhou in the afternoon. After the team returns, they will prepare reports and submit them for discussion to determine the renovation plan for the Qiantang River Seawall and then implement it.

[Our Jiaxing Dispatch, 12th] The Haiyan Electric Qiantang Seawall Engineering Inspection Team took a car on the 12th at the most auspicious time. UNRRA American engineer Mei Annuo also came to participate. First, they went to Zhao Wei's No. 1 Dyke, which is 10 kilometers away from Haining. This place was newly breached at the beginning of August, measuring more than 20 meters. They are currently rushing to build a wooden embankment. Then they crossed Jianshan, Huangwan, Xiepu, Changchuan Dam and reached Qinshan Bay. The base of the embankment is still good, but the body of the embankment has been eroded. Then they went to Deng Weiqiao. According to the engineering experts of the team, the destruction of this type of stone embankment is closely related to mud and water piles. The experts have packed the soil into cans to take back for research. Then they arrived at Haiyan City. There are dangerous walls and broken walls in the county town, reflecting the wealth of the past, but now there are mixed feelings. Slogans such as "Welcome experts to build the underwater Great Wall" are posted on the street. This is enough to show the people along the river's earnest expectations for the experts.

Generally, it is believed that the bandits deliberately sabotaged, but because the road protection is strict, they could not get close to the railway track, and could only seek to create terror.

### Bizarre Murder Case in Suzhou

Wife of a Soldier Shoots Her Husband

[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 13th] A bizarre and shocking murder case occurred in this county on the afternoon of the 12th.

According to reporters' investigations, the details are as follows: Xu Maolin, a 29-year-old captain of the training team of the 24th Regiment of Heavy Military Vehicles stationed in Suzhou, married Ye Suming, a woman from Nanhai, Guangdong (19 years old, a graduate of Liuzhou National Middle School) in November last year. After coming to Suzhou, they lived together in the troop dormitory. Over the past month, the couple's relationship suddenly broke down, and they even intended to divorce. At 4 p.m. on the 12th, the couple were discussing in the room when a quarrel broke out. In a fit of anger, Ms. Ye retrieved a No. 3 American-style revolver placed on the bed and shot Xu.

### Gentry Association in Northern Jiangsu Sends a Letter to Zhou Enlai Urging the Communist Army to Withdraw Immediately, Hoping that Their Fellow Countryman Will Restore the People's Hearts

[Our City News] More than 20 people, including Xie Shuqiang, Ma Shuli, Zhu Shiqiu, and other former national assemblymen in northern Jiangsu, recently jointly sent a letter to Zhou Enlai, requesting that he persuade the Communist Party to withdraw from northern Jiangsu. The general meaning of the original letter was: Northern Jiangsu has been devastated, oppressed, and squeezed by the enemy for eight years, and its vitality has been exhausted. After the victory, the Communist Party stole the cities and implemented the so-called "three capitals" and "three all" policies, resulting in people fleeing on the roads and a lack of a sense of community. Therefore, they earnestly appealed to the Communist Party to leave northern Jiangsu, so that the people can obtain true liberation. They also said: "The 3 million people currently exiled abroad, once they rise up and organize a returning team with a determination to die to survive, wherever the army goes, how can it not sweep away its hatred?" Finally, it was said: "It is reported that if the Communist army fails, it will breach the dikes to flood the area, and the fields, animals, and people of the more than 20 counties in the Lixia River will be destroyed. This move must not be allowed. If so, the Communist Party will isolate itself from the people. Then, what is the point of political party struggle? Therefore, Zhou is requested to respond to the people's request, consider the fellow villagers (Zhou is also from northern Jiangsu), restore the hearts of the people, restore the credibility of the Communist Party, and resolutely appeal to the Communist troops to withdraw from northern Jiangsu immediately, otherwise, they will respectfully appeal to the government to issue a clear order to suppress them."

### News Briefs

Our Suzhou Dispatch: The Jiangsu Provincial Government has decided to establish army soldier demobilization stations in the northern and southern Jiangsu regions. The station in northern Jiangsu will be located in Xuzhou, and the station in Suzhou will be located in Suzhou, specializing in registering and issuing certificates to surplus soldiers for their return home.

Our Hankou Dispatch: According to the person in charge of the receiving and verification group, there are indeed several cases of illegal seizure of private industries here. They are currently being verified separately and are preparing to inform the receiving agencies to return them to their original owners.

### Local Correspondence: Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters Ordered to Strictly Prohibit Troops from Occupying Civilian Housing

[Our Xuzhou Correspondence] The Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters recently received a telegram order from General Chen of the Ministry of National Defense: (1) It is strictly forbidden for troops to forcibly occupy civilian housing and educational and cultural institutions. If they have already been occupied, they should be evacuated immediately. (2) If they do not evacuate within the time limit, the people are allowed to directly complain or report to the military leaders of the provinces and cities, and they will be severely punished according to law. The commanders of the troops who forcibly occupy civilian housing or educational and cultural institutions will be dismissed and punished. (3) If the building is damaged during the period of forcible occupation and the evidence is solid, the military leaders of the provinces and cities shall order the forcibly occupying troops to be responsible for repairing or compensating. It is reported that the Pacification Headquarters has forwarded the order to all military agencies and troops for strict compliance.

Changshu: Military Police Join Forces to Suppress Communist Troops Infiltrating the Border

More than 100 Communist troops suddenly appeared along the river in the seventh district of this county. Upon receiving the report, the county authorities have strengthened their defenses and cooperated with the military and police to set out to suppress them in the fourth and seventh districts. After searching along the way, they arrived at Luyuan and Leyu Town, but there were no Communist troops. It was reported that more than 100 Communist troops had stayed near the area and have now fled to Jiangyin. After the meeting with the Siyu Port, Yongfeng Town, and Nantong troops, they turned into the second district in the west. Although there was heavy rain along the way, they were still in high spirits and returned to the city via Fushan Pond and Xiejiabridge, each returning to their original defenses.

Wuxi: The second session of the County Provisional Assembly was held in the clubhouse on Gongyuan Road in the city at 10 a.m. on the 12th for the opening ceremony. Speaker Jiang gave the opening speech, County Mayor Xu gave a speech, and Councilors Zhang Jiuyi and others gave speeches. After the ceremony, the meeting adjourned. The meeting adjourned in the afternoon. The next morning, the general meeting will be held for the work report of the county administrative agencies. The important issue of this session of the conference is the merger of townships, because the division and merger of townships is unreasonable in many places, so there will be a discussion.

Jiangyin: Former Police Chief Arrested in Shanghai

Wang Jiazhen, the police chief during the enemy-puppet period in Cheng, searched people's property, framed good people, and did all kinds of evil. Since the victory, he has been wanted but not found. On the 10th, Chen Tao, the military section chief of the county government, received a report that Wang had recently been hiding in Shanghai. He went to Shanghai himself, arrested Wang, and detained him at the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters. He telegraphed County Mayor Fang to prepare a document to send personnel to Shanghai on the 12th to escort him.

Songjiang: Special Commissioner of the Third District Tours the Counties

Xie Chengbing, the special commissioner of the third district and commander of the security forces, set out from Songjiang on the 11th to inspect the counties in order to understand the political affairs and the suffering of the people in the counties. It is reported that he will first go to Fengxian and Shanghai, and then to the other counties under his jurisdiction. The duties of the special commissioner's office and the security commander's office have been entrusted to Secretary Wu Huiyi and Deputy Commander Zhu Changzhong, respectively, to open and process documents on his behalf.

### Message to the Compatriots from the Chairman

Therefore, on this day of the first anniversary of the enemy's surrender, I would like to specifically put forward three points to guide my compatriots in a common direction of effort in order to comfort the spirits of the soldiers and civilians who sacrificed for the War of Resistance in heaven:

Clarify Right and Wrong and Uphold Integrity

First, we must clarify right and wrong and uphold integrity. The safety, danger, governance, and chaos of the nation and the nation all depend on the rise and fall of the people's concept of right and wrong and the principles of justice. The wisdom of people, the success or failure of things, all lie in distinguishing right from wrong and discerning interests. The location of right and wrong is the location of interests. The reason why our country's eight-year War of Resistance was able to last and win was entirely due to the spirit of our national army and civilians who only saw right and wrong and did not care about interests, and only knew great righteousness and did not hesitate to sacrifice. From this, we can know that interests are determined by right and wrong. The place of great interest must be great right, and the place of great wrong will eventually be great harm. We must never reverse the true right and wrong for temporary personal interests, and disregard the permanent welfare of the nation and the nation. At this moment of crisis and turbulence, it is especially necessary to base ourselves on facts and distinguish the location of right and wrong, so that national opinion has a fixed point and people's hearts have a direction. Then, even if the country has temporary turmoil, it will eventually be able to quickly recover and achieve peace and order. Otherwise, if the true and false are reversed, black and white are confused, heresies are rampant, and correct arguments disappear, over time, it will inevitably lead to becoming accustomed to wrong and regarding it as right, and harm as profit, and the nation and the nation will fall into an incurable situation. Therefore, our compatriots must uphold integrity and clarify right and wrong at this moment, and must not follow the crowd and mislead themselves and the country. Observing the general atmosphere in recent times, almost only interests are discussed and right and wrong are not discussed, only violence is known and justice is not known, and only puppets are known and the country is not known. This phenomenon must be completely corrected before the country can have a bright future.

Understand Propriety, Justice, and Know Shame

Second, we must understand propriety, justice, and know shame. A country must be established on the earth. Our China has been established for thousands of years and has gone through countless turmoils, but it has been able to stand firm without falling, all thanks to the high morality of our nation and the greatness of our national culture. Propriety, justice, integrity, and shame are the four dimensions of a country, and are especially the universally and deeply ingrained moral standards of our nation. In short, propriety and justice show people the canons of positive behavior, while integrity and shame are warnings to people about the scope of what is not allowed. At this time after the war, the moral standards are greatly damaged, especially in general urban areas, where human desires are rampant, and everyone regards taking advantage of difficulties and opportunistic acquisitions as their ability. Our national people with lofty ideals should take saving the nation and building the country as their responsibility, and must act as pillars in the middle stream to save the decadent hearts of the people. If we can understand propriety, we will naturally be brave to do what is right and go all out, keeping propriety and fulfilling our duties meticulously. If we can know shame, we will naturally respect ourselves, cherish ourselves, not lose our personality, and not have behaviors that degrade our dignity, and be despised by foreigners. In this way, with integrity and shame restraining each other and propriety and justice as preparation, society will have a positive and upward spirit, and the country will be able to establish a foundation of independence and freedom. Otherwise, if integrity and shame are swept away and propriety and justice are lost, the War of Resistance, although fought, will still be defeated, and the country, although it exists, will still be dead. The sadness of the matter is no greater than this. My patriotic and self-loving citizens must be vigilant and encourage themselves.

Clarify Responsibility and Abide by Laws and Discipline

Third, we must clarify responsibility and abide by laws and discipline. Citizens of modern countries all value responsibility, and all respect laws and discipline. Only by valuing responsibility can they be diligent and enterprising, and only by respecting laws and discipline can they maintain order. These two are the driving forces for progress. Our China is lagging behind in everything, and the concept of laws and discipline is the weakest. Now, when the world situation is uncertain, and it is also a time of national affairs, to overcome difficulties, strive for invigoration, and enter the ranks of modern countries, we must value responsibility and abide by the laws of war. We must know that the government has the responsibility of the government, and the people also have the responsibility of the people. We must clearly distinguish and examine, each according to their ability, each fulfilling their responsibility, not shirking, not being negligent, and then we can overcome all difficulties and do everything. At the same time, all of us, both up and down the country, must clarify and value discipline, abide by order, officials and historians must not abuse their power and hinder the freedom of the people, and the people must not abuse their freedom and abandon their national duties. In particular, we must strictly refrain from despising the law and disrupting order, so that our society is an orderly society, and our people are truly self-respecting and self-governing people.

The Great Undertaking of Rejuvenation Must Be Completed, and Any Resistance Cannot Be Stopped

Principles to be Followed, I further ask my compatriots across the country to embrace the ancient teaching of "When the wind and rain are dark, the rooster crows incessantly," and especially to strengthen their confidence, temper their aspirations, and recognize the importance of the relationship between China's post-war revival and world justice. Do not be pessimistic, do not be bewildered. We have fought hard for eight years in the War of Resistance, with strong and weak differences in labor, and what difficulties we have faced, we finally relied on unwavering confidence to achieve the final victory. Looking back then,

The above points are the criteria that the general public must abide by at ordinary times, and especially those that must be followed during the period of restoration and nation-building, it can be said that there is nothing to rely on. What we rely on is only the inherent culture and moral spirit of our nation for thousands of years, as well as human justice and world justice. The victory of China's War of Resistance has increased the power of international justice and the authority of morality. If, after defeating Japan, our China cannot maintain the fruits of victory and is still inevitably in danger and death, this is not only our own misfortune. What a great blow it will be to human justice. Understanding this meaning, we know that our efforts to turn around the domestic situation and achieve peaceful unification are in fact the most solemn task for the nation and the world. Now the war has long ended, and we are only waiting to clear the thorns, work hard later, engage in restoration, and complete the great cause of nation-building. From today's point of view, during the War of Resistance, we had such a persistent and unyielding spirit, and our nation has such a long history and great culture. What difficulties cannot be overcome and what construction cannot be completed. Although the current situation is extremely complex, the constant principles and rules are always constant. We must have confidence that the future of our nation is always bright and long-term, and that any resistance cannot stop our restoration. I, Zhongzheng, have been committed to the revolution, experienced hundreds of hardships, and led the War of Resistance for more than eight years. I can never allow the life of the Republic of China, which was exchanged for the sacrifice and bloodshed of countless soldiers and civilians, to be easily destroyed. I will never bear to add to the suffering of my people who have survived the war, and I will never change my established steps to pray for peaceful unification and democracy due to any stimulation or obstruction. I will inevitably act according to my conscience, fulfill my duties, and lead my compatriots across the country to advance on the road to nation-building according to procedures and common practices. With a sincere wish, I would like to express it to my compatriots on the occasion of today's commemoration, and I deeply hope that we can work together with one heart and one mind to eliminate the catastrophe of our country, preserve the lifeline of our nation, and jointly accomplish the full success of our revolutionary nation-building. (End)

Editorial

### The Great Charter of National Revival

— Reflections on Reading Chairman Chiang's Proclamation

The proclamation by Chairman Chiang, eagerly awaited by people at home and abroad, has finally arrived on the eve of the first anniversary of Japan's unconditional surrender. In the past year, the people's displacement and suffering have not diminished, and the political disputes within the country have not ceased. We feel sincerely comforted upon reading the Chairman's proclamation. It shows that the government, in handling the current turmoil, has not hesitated to endure humiliation and make concessions out of concern for the people's welfare. The country is severely weakened after the war and cannot withstand further warfare. This painstaking effort is not only understood but also embraced by the people nationwide. Therefore, even though the domestic situation is so severe, the government still adheres to the policy of peaceful unification in handling the current political disputes. Consider what

the Chairman stated in the fifth point of his future policy directions within the proclamation: "As long as the Communist Party's army faithfully implements the agreement to cease conflict and restore transportation, and obeys mediation to implement unified organization, so that the nationalization of the army is not merely empty words, once this is guaranteed, the government can at any time concretely discuss all unresolved issues." This not only expresses the government's broad and benevolent attitude but also demonstrates that the path to reopening negotiations has not been cut off. The Chinese people, upon reading the Chairman's proclamation, are sincerely encouraged, needless to say. They have suffered enough from the Communist Party's disasters and urgently hope that the domestic situation can move towards stability, giving them an opportunity to recuperate and rebuild. They cannot tolerate this situation dragging on indefinitely. The government's willingness to compromise and endure humiliation is aimed at achieving an early resolution, and the frustration of their hopes is due to the Communist Party's sabotage. Therefore, today, after reading the Chairman's proclamation, we can only sincerely reiterate our urgent appeal to the Chinese Communist Party, hoping that they will prioritize the will of the people nationwide, consider the suffering of the people after the disaster, and demonstrate the sincerity of implementing previously established agreements through actions. The government has been more than generous to the Communist Party. Under these generous and favorable conditions, the Communist Party should prioritize national interests and refrain from creating further obstacles. Only then can China embark on the path of great revival.

Regarding the future policy to be adopted in resolving domestic political disputes, after studying the entire text, we feel as if this is truly a great charter for our nation's revival. The listed provisions and the spirit they embody are comparable to the Atlantic Charter. It points out the path for our future politics, reaffirms the government's determination to end tutelage and implement constitutionalism, and its long-cherished wish to sincerely cooperate with all parties and factions. All of this serves as a guiding principle for our future political democratization and is especially what the general public desires.

But what we find particularly inspiring are the three points that the Chairman has proclaimed to us: to distinguish between right and wrong and uphold righteousness, to understand propriety, righteousness, and a sense of shame to raise the level of our national morality, and to understand responsibility and abide by laws and disciplines to establish our social order. These may seem outdated, but they are the necessary foundation for our national revival. Truth has no distinction between outdated and new; as long as it is truth, it is always new. The root cause of all problems in China now lies in the lack of clear distinction between right and wrong, the decline of morality, and the lack of adherence to discipline. Because of these phenomena, moral principles have been lost. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, we must have a moral foundation to move forward on the path of national reconstruction and revival. The Chinese people should engrave these three points proclaimed by the Chairman in their hearts and be vigilant at all times. A nation standing on earth must have prosperity and standing. Our country has always been a nation that emphasizes propriety and righteousness and highly values morality. This is a solid foundation for our nation's development. In recent times, many Chinese people have regarded morality as pedantic, but they do not know that a nation without morality cannot stand in the world. Although the material civilization of Western European countries is highly developed, without their moral codes as the standard for the behavior of the people and even the nation, how could they have today's prosperity? Therefore, if we want to revive our nation, we must establish the moral foundation for national revival.

In summary, the entire text of the Chairman's proclamation is based on faith, hope, and love. Faith refers to the people's trust in the government. The government always prioritizes the interests of the people, so it always advocates resolving political disputes through political means. Therefore, the people must have faith in the government. Furthermore, all parties must have faith in resolving political disputes. The agreements that have been established are promises and must be adhered to and faithfully implemented. Love refers to the fact that the people certainly love and protect the government, and the government also loves the people, so it "does not hesitate to endure humiliation and make concessions in order to seek opportunities for rest and recuperation for all our compatriots." At the same time, although the Communist Party is expanding its occupied territories and demanding constant increases, and agreements are often overturned, the government still adheres to a broad-minded approach: "As long as the Communist Party's army faithfully implements the agreement to cease conflict and restore transportation, and obeys mediation to implement unified organization, so that the nationalization of the army is not merely empty words, once this is guaranteed, the government can at any time concretely discuss all unresolved issues." What is this if not "love"? Hope refers to the hope that the Communist Party can prioritize the interests of the people so that peaceful unification can be realized, and also the hope that the people can distinguish between right and wrong, understand propriety, righteousness, and a sense of shame, and understand responsibility and abide by laws and disciplines. After reading the entire text, we are even more convinced that domestic disputes can be resolved and that the Chinese nation will surely be revived, and that the Chairman's proclamation is truly the great charter for our national revival!

### Soviet Union Hurls Political Bomb at Turkey, Demands Control of the Straits, Britain Advocates Convening International Conference to Discuss Revising the Montreux Convention

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] London, 13th (Radio): The Soviet Union formally notified Turkey on the 8th of this month, advocating revising the Montreux Convention, believing that the administrative power of the Dardanelles Strait should be placed under the management of the Black Sea countries, with Turkey jointly responsible for the Strait's directional work.

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] London, 13th (Radio): A British Foreign Office spokesman said today: If an international conference is held to revise the Montreux Convention, the United States may send representatives to participate. However, the other three signatory countries of the convention, namely Japan, Romania, and Bulgaria, may not have the opportunity to attend because they fought on the side of the Axis powers. It is noted that the three countries of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union signed an agreement at the Potsdam Conference that the Montreux Convention should be reconsidered.

[Reuters, Istanbul, 12th (Dispatch)] According to the latest news: In the note from the Soviet Union to Turkey requesting the revision of the Montreux Convention, it expresses the hope that only Black Sea littoral countries should discuss the new status of the Straits and the control of navigation. The Black Sea littoral countries are the Soviet Union, Romania, Bulgaria, and Turkey.

[Reuters, Istanbul, 12th (Dispatch)] The Turkish government has recently been considering the Soviet request to revise the Montreux Convention within the newly formed Bekar Cabinet. It is reported that the Soviet Union is not only requesting to revise the Montreux Convention but also wants to jointly control and defend the Dardanelles Strait with Turkey. The Turkish Cabinet held multiple meetings yesterday, which lasted until late at night. Officials are still keeping silent about the content of the Soviet note. Local people believe that the Soviet move is a political bombshell, and it is expected that the Turkish government will soon announce the full text of the Soviet note and the Turkish reply.

[Agence France-Presse, Turkish Capital, 12th (Dispatch)] According to semi-official sources, the Turkish reply to the Soviet Union will state that according to the Montreux Convention Regarding the Straits, the terms of the convention can only be revised with the consent of all signatory countries, so this matter cannot be negotiated solely by the Soviet Union and Turkey. Diplomatic circles generally believe that Turkey will take a firm stance on this issue and that the Straits issue is the most important issue related to Turkey's survival interests.

Britain Determined to Back Turkey, Likely to Cause Diplomatic Conflict

[Reuters, London, 12th (Dispatch)] Local people predict that the Soviet Union's request to revise the Montreux Convention regarding the use of the Dardanelles will likely cause another diplomatic conflict between the Soviet Union and Western countries. The British government will back Turkey and allow it to oppose the Soviet Union's desire to gain a foothold in the Turkish Straits area. However, in view of its similar situation in the Suez Canal, Britain will likely seek a compromise to satisfy the Soviet Union's security demands. The Soviet note received by the British government at the end of the week has not yet been announced, but according to reliable sources, the Soviet Union will include its demand for joint control and defense of the Dardanelles in the note, citing its leading position in the Black Sea and its security. This means establishing military and air bases within Turkey. The Turkish government will certainly consider this as a loss of its independence and national security and will resolutely reject it. Britain now hopes to persuade the Soviet Union to accept a compromise solution, urging it to join the committee of the United Nations to control the Straits passage. Britain also supports the principle of revising the Montreux Convention proposed by the United Nations in November last year.

### Mysterious Missile Again Visits Swedish Skies, Swedish General Staff Considers Situation Serious, Commonly Called Russian V-4 Missile

[Reuters, Swedish Capital, 12th (Dispatch)] Recently, mysterious missiles have been passing through Swedish skies. Another one was discovered in the central skies yesterday, and the national atmosphere is in an abnormal state of tension. It is rumored that the Swedish government has borrowed several radars from Britain to investigate the source of this mysterious bomb. American long-range bomber expert General Doolittle has departed for here. Although officials say that this is to negotiate business on behalf of Shell Oil Company, it is generally believed to be related to the mysterious bomb. The Swedish General Staff announced today, "The situation is extremely serious!" The repeated infringements of Swedish sovereignty can no longer be tolerated and should be ended by various means. Last night and this morning, the General Staff received more than a thousand reports

regarding the mysterious rocket bomb. The authorities have also sent experts to investigate evidence throughout the country. The reports vary, with some saying it is circular, but all say that small fireballs were ejected after the explosion. The Swedish public now commonly calls it the "Russian V-4" missile. The Swedish government has ordered its embassy in Finland to jointly investigate with the Finnish authorities.

[United Press, Swedish Capital, 12th (Dispatch)] Today, an experienced observer in the local newspaper claimed: Yesterday, he saw an unmanned rocket flying by. The body was like a torpedo, with a pointed tail, emitting bluish-green smoke and a series of fireballs. This observer had been trained in observing celestial phenomena and used a telescope to watch the clouds when the rocket appeared. Its speed was higher than that of an aircraft. It disappeared completely after an explosion, leaving no smoke, light, or sparks. This rocket

was about ninety to one hundred feet long (thirty meters). Before the explosion, it stayed in the air and began to descend. The flash of fire dazzled the eyes. The previous rocket that passed through Switzerland was launched from the coast of Poland. The explosion proved that it was equipped with an automatic destruction device, so experts could not find its traces. Swedish newspapers can confirm the existence of automatic destruction device.

[Agence France-Presse, Swedish Lorea, 13th (Dispatch)] Last night, a bomb fell on a building in Zhulan Province. A lieutenant in the Swedish Air Force witnessed the event and said that the missile was shaped like a torpedo, about twenty meters long, and had a fire tail when flying. The Swedish authorities have strengthened alert in the Noland area. It is speculated that missiles have also fallen within Norway, and they are generally speculated to have been launched from the Soviet-occupied area of Germany.

### American Jet Rocket Creates New Record

[United Press, Fort Virginia, Leichmond, 12th (Dispatch)] The Army announced that the jet-propelled P-80 rocket flew from Worto, Washington State, to here in thirty-five minutes today, a distance of 395 miles, creating an unofficial new record.

### Another Batch of Indian Troops Arrives in Basra, Iraq Plans to Appeal to the Security Council

[Reuters, Report from Afar, 12th (Dispatch)] Two ships arrived in Basra today, carrying troops from India to protect British, Indian, and Arab interests in southern Iran.

[United Press International, Washington, 12th (Dispatch)] Iranian Ambassador to the United States Alai declared today that the presence of British troops in Basra and the threat of unilateral action taken by the British side cannot be tolerated. This situation may force Iran to submit this dispute to the Security Council.

### Soviet Union Attacks Netherlands, Accuses it of Being a Vassal of Britain and the United States

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 12th (Dispatch)] Soviet commentator Sergei criticized the Netherlands' attitude in the peace conference. He briefly stated that the Netherlands is a "vassal of Britain and the United States." Studying the relationship between the "British and American leaders" and their "vassals" is sufficient to understand the attitude of the Dutch representative. The Netherlands is a small country with vast colonies, including Indonesia, with its colonies sixty times the size of its mainland. If it wants to develop them, its work is beyond the capacity of the Dutch military and it has to jointly manage them with powerful countries. The rich territory of the Netherlands is now not only developed by one country, but Britain and the United States are also participating, he said.

### Yoshida Broadcasts to the Nation on Anniversary of Japanese Surrender

[United Press International, Tokyo, 13th (Dispatch)] Japanese Prime Minister Yoshida will deliver a broadcast speech to the nation at 7:03 PM Tokyo time on August 14th, the anniversary of Japan's surrender.

### Another Representative of Former Enemy Nation Speaks at the Peace Conference, Romanian Deputy Prime Minister Expresses Heartfelt Gratitude for Recovering Pre-War Lost Territories, Damage Suffered Should Be Compensated by Germany and Hungary

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Paris, 13th (Radio): The peace conference continued at 3:05 PM (midnight Shanghai time) today. The Romanian representative, Deputy Prime Minister Tătărescu, spoke at 4:10 PM at the invitation of Bernas. He first expressed his gratitude for the points in the draft peace treaty with Romania prepared by the Council of Foreign Ministers. He stated that the provision in the draft treaty for the return of northern Outer Transylvania to Romania is another reason for the Romanians to express their heartfelt gratitude. This move can bring the Romanian and Hungarian peoples closer together in cooperation.

He then elaborated on the political, military, and economic provisions, one by one. He expressed regret that the status of Romania, which leaned towards the Allied front and became an Axis participant, was not clarified. Tătărescu acknowledged that Romania was drawn into the anti-Soviet war by the rash actions of traitors and adventurers, but he vigorously stated that since August 24, 1944, based on the armistice agreement, the Romanian army, with eighteen divisions totaling 385,000 men, equipped with air force units, launched an attack on the Nazi aggressors and the Hungarian army, with at least 110,000 killed or wounded. At that time, not a single soldier was fighting side by side with the German side. They had fulfilled their loyalty to the Allies, so the losses suffered should be compensated by Germany and Hungary, and Romania has the right to demand this, he said. Deputy Prime Minister Tătărescu was still young. At the beginning of his speech, he appeared to be "stage-frightened," but he quickly regained his confidence and demeanor.

### List of Our Representatives Attending Various Committees of the Peace Conference

[Central News Agency, Paris, 12th (Dispatch)] The Chinese delegation attending the peace conference in Paris has decided on the list of personnel representing our country in various committees as follows: The representatives attending the General Issues Committee are Wang Shijie and Guo Taiqi, the representative attending the Political and Territorial Committee of the peace treaty with Italy is Guo Taiqi, the representative attending the Military Committee of the peace treaty with Italy is also Zhan Bingchang, and the representative attending the Legal Drafting Committee is Qian Tai.

[Reuters, Paris, 12th (Dispatch)] The conference assembly discussed the organization of the Secretariat of the Conference. The Soviet Union opposed the appointment of Australian Foreign Minister Evatt as Secretary, suggesting that an Abyssinian fill the position, but Abyssinia refused. Britain then suggested that China, Brazil, and Yugoslavia, who had previously formed the Secretariat with the Four Powers, should form the Secretariat, which was adopted, and French Thebac was elected as Secretary-General.

### Soviet Foreign Minister Sharply Refutes Italian Prime Minister's Statement, Says Anti-Fascist Remnants Must Be Eradicated, Representative from Greece Also States Opinion

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Paris, 13th (Radio): Bernas and Vyshinsky had a heated debate during yesterday night's conference discussing the peace treaty with Italy. Today, Molotov accused some major powers of being unwilling to consider the interests of both France and Italy, intending to create a hegemonic position in the Mediterranean.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 13th (Dispatch)] The peace conference opened at 10 AM today, still chaired by American Bernas. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov visited and expressed his opinion, refuting the speech given by Italian Prime Minister Gasperi at the conference the other day. His language was severe, but the atmosphere was far more orderly than that of the Procedural Committee. French Prime Minister Bidault and British Foreign Secretary Bevin were not present. Australian Foreign Minister Evatt changed his position and talked with friends. The Soviet delegation listened to the speech of the British. The British said that they believe Italy will become a free and great nation. Mussolini's Italy had taken the path of imperialism in the past, colluding with Germany and Japan, and Italy had invaded Abyssinia, Albania, and France. Even in the Battle of Stalingrad, when the German army was defeated, Italy gradually split from Germany. The past is full of verifiable facts. The failure of Fascism is not the reason why Italy should be reduced to a second-class country. Italy and France should not lose their status as major Mediterranean powers. A reformed and new Italy must have a harmonious relationship with the Allies and should be honest with all democratic countries. The political life of Italy must be reformed into a democratic country, and the remnants of Fascism must be reduced. Italy has not achieved all these points. In Gasperi's entire speech, he did not mention Fascism and Mussolini, and the purpose was to defend the interests of his country. Gasperi insisted on the Fascist aggression (representatives of Slavic countries and war), and Gasperi did not express the views of a democratic Italy on Trieste and Istria, but instead reiterated the old articles of imperialist Italy. Yugoslavia has made great contributions to the victory. If Italy does not consider the demands of the South, it will not harm its democratic rebirth, he said. After Molotov's speech, Abyssinian representative Julodov gave a speech, condemning Italy for invading Abyssinia three times in a century. Finally, Greek Rifanel Tris spoke, saying that Italy should be fully responsible for the disasters suffered by Greece and that Greece should receive full compensation in order to implement economic recovery. After Tsai's simple speech, Chairman Bernas announced a recess and will resume at 3 PM in the afternoon. At that time, the Romanian representative will express his opinion.

### Peace Conference Delegates Suffer from Soap Shortage

[Reuters, Paris, 12th (Dispatch)] The lack of soap is also one of the difficulties faced by the peace conference delegates. When the conference opened, the delegates received food and clothing ration coupons, but no soap ration coupons. After requesting, each person only received one soap coupon. Women received facial soap, and men received shaving soap, so the current problem is whether men can wash their faces with shaving soap.

### Mussolini's Corpse Finally Discovered

[Agence France-Presse, Milan, 13th]: Mussolini's corpse has been missing for a long time. Italian military and police conducted a large-scale search, but to no avail. Until last night, a monk discovered it in the Casucian Monastery in Pavia, south of Milan. The corpse was wrapped in a burlap sack, locked in a box, and hidden in the monastery's cellar. Abbot Lombo stated that a stranger came yesterday afternoon and handed him a box, ordering him to hide it. It is suspected that this person is the main culprit in stealing and hiding the corpse. A notice was found in the burlap sack next to the corpse, bearing the name "Mogge, Founder of Democracy and Fascism." Mogge had already been arrested. The contents of the notice prove the corpse's origin, confirming that it is indeed Mussolini.

### Former US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Analyzes Current Soviet Policies (Part 2) He Says Roosevelt Was Mistaken

(3) The Secret Police System

The Tsars used the secret police as a tool to maintain their autocratic rule. This method continued to exist after the revolution. Although the organization has been reorganized three times since Lenin's "Cheka," its nature has never changed. The secret police receive better treatment, lodging, and food than the Red Army. They have their own artillery units, air force, prisons, and execution grounds. As for personnel, they now number over 600,000. The people of the Soviet Union are completely under their secret surveillance.

Even the Red Army is subject to the jurisdiction of the "OGPU." Every residential area, factory, farm, organization, and theater has secret agents stationed there. Every Communist Party member must report to them any suspicious thoughts or criticisms they hear. Foreign ambassadors, Soviet dignitaries, and high-ranking Red Army generals are followed by secret police. They even secretly installed recording devices in the bedroom of the US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Davies, to eavesdrop on his words. Each foreign ambassador is followed by four secret agents day and night in shifts. If a Soviet citizen speaks to them, someone will immediately ask what they said. In front of the American consulate residence in Vladivostok, the secret police installed a searchlight, directly facing the house, and a face peered in through the window day and night to see who was inside. Soviets never dared to step through that door. The secret police rule the entire Soviet Union with terror.

In the fields of science and art, a non-Communist Party member may still achieve fame and reach a high position. But in other areas, anyone who wants to achieve a significant political or economic position must be a party member. Of course, there is only one party in the Soviet Union; the other parties have all been "cleared."

Stalin faithfully executed Lenin's instructions from 1901, which stated that the party should not be an ordinary so-called political party, but a "military organization." Lenin said, "The party must lead the proletariat in attack, and if necessary, lead them in retreat."

According to democratic principles, the leader of a political party must meet the wishes of the voters; otherwise, people will elect someone else next time. But in the Soviet Union, there is only one political party. The "election" is merely selecting the list determined by the government dictator. Elections here are nothing more than a government-organized spectacle.

(4) The Communist Doctrine

The Soviet government believes in this communist doctrine, which holds that once all countries in the world are under Communist Party dictatorship and the system of private property is completely eradicated, all domestic and international wars will cease. At that time, the state will cease to exist, and people all over the world can live and work in peace. Lenin said, "Where there is the state, there is no freedom; where there is freedom, there is no need for the state." Perhaps it is the mysterious nature of this sentence that has aroused religious-like fanaticism in many people. Since the highest ideal in life is to promote the elimination of the state system and the establishment of a worldwide communist dictatorship, then the highest responsibility of man is to try to achieve this goal. In order to achieve this goal, all means, including war, assassination, betrayal, and breach of contract, can be used. Lenin once said, "It is necessary to use any tricks, cunning, illegal acts, and concealment of the truth." Therefore, the goal of the Soviet government should be to achieve a world proletarian dictatorship by any means.

The following passage from Lenin more clearly contains the basic theory of Soviet foreign policy: "We do not live in one country, but in a system of countries. It is inconceivable that the Soviet government can coexist peacefully with imperialist countries for a long time. In the end, either we must subdue them or they must subdue us. The conflict between the Soviet government and the propertied government is an avoidable event." [Lenin: "Selected Works of Lenin" Stalin: "Problems of Leninism" contains excerpts]

Those who think that Soviet diplomacy is too uncertain are confusing goals and tactics. The goal of the Soviet government has always been unchanged, but tactics change from time to time depending on the circumstances, just like a good chief of staff hides his plans and moves his troops. It carefully weighs its strengths and weaknesses, advances when it can advance, and retreats when it must retreat. In this situation, all peace treaties and non-aggression pacts are regarded as nothing more than tools. They sign them because they feel that they seem useful temporarily, and then break them tomorrow because they do not conform to the goal of world proletarian revolution.

It is very unfortunate that while the whole world is striving for peace in the status quo, the Soviet Union is still striving for the expansion of its own ideology.

### Completing Local Self-Government, Promoting Municipal Construction, First Municipal Council Solemnly Established Yesterday, Pan Gongzhan and Xu Jiyun Elected Speaker and Deputy Speaker

[Report from Our Newspaper] Shanghai's first Municipal Council solemnly held its inauguration ceremony and took office yesterday, the first "August 13th" anniversary after the victory. A total of 171 councilors attended, exceeding half the total. After a brief break and photo session at 9:25 AM, the election of the Speaker and Deputy Speaker began. Du Yuesheng and Xu Jiyun were elected. However, Du Yuesheng declined the position on the spot due to physical weakness. Therefore, a re-election of the Speaker was legally conducted, and finally Pan Gongzhan was elected as the first Speaker in Shanghai's history with an absolute majority of 154 votes.

The Venue Was Decorated with a Solemn Atmosphere

Yesterday's venue, No. 1 Zhongzheng West Road, was accessed through the Huashan Road gate. From around 7:00 AM, the traffic was constant and never-ending. Above the entrance were hung two banners with the national flag, the party flag, and the ethnic flag. On the right side was a brown wooden sign with the words "Shanghai Municipal Council" written in green. Upon entering, one immediately felt surrounded by greenery, making it exceptionally cool. Passing through a square, one arrived at the auditorium. Above it hung a banner in red silk with white letters reading "Inauguration Ceremony of the First Shanghai Municipal Council." Below were attached two large golden characters, "Ming Chang". The auditorium had 180 seats, divided into five long rows, with stationery provided on each desk. This newspaper presented each seat with a copy of the day's paper, placed on the desk for reading. To the left of the councilors' seats were the reporters' seats, and to the right were the visitors' seats. In front of the rostrum were potted plants with fragrant grass, and in the center were the national flag, the party flag, and the portrait of the Founding Father. On the four walls were posted slogans such as "Promote Public Opinion," "Exercise Civil Rights," "Speak Without Reservation," "Say Everything," "Complete Local Self-Government," and "Promote Municipal Construction," creating an extremely solemn, simple, and harmonious atmosphere for the conference.

171 Councilors Attended

This newspaper's reporter drove there early yesterday morning at 7:00 AM and was the first to arrive. Soon after, Wan Molin of the Municipal Farmers' Association arrived, being the first councilor to arrive. At 7:35 AM, Mayor Wu, accompanied by Chuan Rulin, strolled in while chatting and laughing. Five minutes later, Pan Gongzhan, Zhang Yiqu, and Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, also arrived. By the time the meeting began, out of the 180 councilors, 5 had not reported in, and 4 were absent with leave, totaling 171 in attendance. Those attending as observers included the directors of various bureaus and departments of the municipal government, such as Xuan Tiewu, Wu Kaixian, and Gu Chunfan, and over ten others. Guests included Yen Hui-ching, Cheng Zhongxing, Chen Baohua, as well as US Army Commander General Gillon, US Navy Commander in Shanghai Rear Admiral Dougherty, US Consul General Davis, British Acting Consul General Ottington, French Consul General Pays, Portuguese Acting Consul General Rico, Chilean Chargé d'Affaires Dr. Marin, and dignitaries from the Resources Committee such as Keswick and Judge Hale.

### Mayor Delivers Speech and Administers Oath, Expresses Three Hopes and Two Points in His Thoughts

At 8:25 AM, Mayor Wu led the distinguished guests from the reception room into the meeting hall. At exactly 8:30 AM, the meeting began. Mayor Wu, as the convener and chairman of the conference, performed the formalities amidst melodious music, and then reported to the conference. Mayor Wu first asked everyone to stand in silence for three minutes. Then, he delivered the opening remarks, stating: "Today is the anniversary of the August 13th Incident. It is only after eight years of arduous resistance that we have the glory of today. Therefore, choosing this day to hold the inaugural meeting of the Municipal Council has its own profound significance. Now, with the pain settled, we should deeply consider three points: (1) Why was there an August 13th Incident? Why did the Japanese dare to invade our country? The remote cause lies in the corruption and division of the Manchu Qing royal family, giving foreigners the opportunity to invade. The proximate cause is that after the revolution and unification, the Japanese devils witnessed our spirit of striving for good governance and felt deeply afraid, and thus did not hesitate to become the pioneers of war. From the lessons of the eight-year war of resistance, we deeply feel that only unity and solidarity can lead to survival, and division is a way of self-destruction. Therefore, we must be united and solidarity in the future, from the country to Shanghai, we must seek survival and progress in sincere unity. (2) Today is the inauguration date of the first official Municipal Council. According to the procedure of the National Revolution, we have now entered the era of constitutional government from the era of tutelage. From today onwards, Shanghai has returned the government to the people. All facilities of the municipal government will be subject to the Municipal Council. (3) Today, both the central government and the local government are moving towards democratic politics. I hope that everyone will unite together, no matter which side, to run the municipal affairs well, especially not to forget the significance of the August 13th Anti-Japanese War, to unite sincerely, and to revitalize the country." The Mayor finally thanked the enthusiastic participation of the councilors, and said: "This truly symbolizes that the future of the city will have unlimited light." After the speech, Mayor Wu, on behalf of Minister of Interior Zhang Lisheng, who was unable to come to Shanghai due to official business, administered the oath. All the councilors stood solemnly, faced the portrait of the Founding Father, raised their right hands, and recited the oath with the administrator: "I solemnly swear that I will恪遵 follow the Founding Father's will, uphold the Three Principles of the People, obey the laws, respect the public opinion of the local people, be loyal and diligent in my duties, and will never engage in corruption or bribery. If I violate this oath, I am willing to accept the most severe punishment. This is my oath." Subsequently, they signed and stamped the oath separately and handed it to the conference staff for collection. After the oath, Mayor Wu delivered another speech, saying: "All the councilors are elected by the people, representing public opinion, and reviewing municipal affairs. Therefore, I have two hopes for the Municipal Council: (1) Shanghai's position is different from that of other provinces and counties. I hope that you can fully express public opinion and not be limited to the interests of individuals and districts. (2) There are many difficulties in building a modern Shanghai. The municipal government is limited by funds, and its strength is not enough in many places. I hope that you will provide some suggestions, mainly constructive ones, and the government will make every effort to adopt and implement them."

### Guests Deliver Speeches

Then, Chen Bin, Secretary-General of the Municipal Party Department, delivered a speech, saying: "Although the War of Resistance has been won, the people are still suffering. I hope that the representatives elected by the people can relieve the people's suffering." Then, Cheng Zhonghang, Supervising Commissioner, delivered a speech: "Shanghai is China's leading city. After the establishment of the Municipal Council, democratic politics has begun to be implemented. Believing that the disciples of democracy can follow the Founding Father's spirit of seeking freedom and equality for China and seeking happiness for the citizens of Shanghai. This is the first point. Secondly, there are two aspects to implementing democratic politics: (1) The administrative organs should respect public opinion; (2) The public opinion organs should fully realize public opinion. This is the second point. Shanghai has been under occupation for eight years, and everything needs to be rebuilt. There are naturally some obstacles that need to be swept away and eliminated before politics can embark on a clear path." Cha Liangjian, President of the Local Court, also delivered a speech, expressing the hope that the Shanghai Municipal Council can become the most representative council of public opinion in the country, and hoping that the Shanghai Municipal Government can become the most capable agency.

The conference emcee immediately announced that the councilors' representatives would deliver a reply. At that time, Councilor Wang Xianqing proposed that Pan Gongzhan should speak, which was immediately unanimously approved (for the full text of Pan Gongzhan's speech, see elsewhere). After the speech, the chairman announced a recess. It was 9:20 AM.

### Du Yuesheng Firmly Resigns as Speaker, Pan Gongzhan Elected in Re-election

At 9:25 AM, all the councilors and guests gathered on the lawn in front of the conference hall for a group photo. Then, all the councilors took a photo. After returning to the meeting hall, the election of the Speaker and Deputy Speaker began. First, the mayor read out the election regulations, and then the conference selected Wang Xianqing, Tao Baichuan, Feng Youzhen, Shui Xiangyun, and Lu Shidao to be the tellers. During the nomination, the staff distributed ballots to each councilor for signature and receipt. The election began with the tellers inspecting the empty ballot box, which was placed under the rostrum. At 10:00 AM, the councilors voted one after another, completing the process in seven minutes. When counting the ballots, Feng Youzhen first reported that the number of ballots issued matched the number of ballots received, and then Wang Xianqing was designated to announce the votes, with Tao Baichuan and Feng Youzhen supervising the announcement. A large blackboard was set up below the stage, and two conference staff members wrote the votes, with Shui Xiangyun and Lu Shidao supervising the writing. The first vote announced was for the Speaker, and the atmosphere immediately became extremely tense. After the votes were counted, Mayor Wu immediately announced, "Du Yuesheng received 116 votes and is elected Speaker." The other votes received were also reported by Mayor Wu as follows: Pan Gongzhan 17 votes, Xu Shihao 1 vote, Wang Zhengting 1 vote, 34 blank votes. Then, the vote for Deputy Speaker was opened, and Xu Jiyun was elected Deputy Speaker with 116 votes. After Mayor Wu reported the election results, Du Yuesheng stood up and said: "Chairman, councilors, I am very honored to be elected Speaker today. However, our country is moving towards democracy, and Shanghai is a major city. The responsibility of the Speaker is extremely important. I am a sick person and cannot take on the task. I do not want to disappoint the public's kindness, but because of my poor health, please forgive me and allow a re-election." Du Yuesheng repeatedly stated that he was breathless as soon as he spoke, indicating that he was physically incapable. However, a few councilors still stood up and spoke, firmly asking Du Yuesheng to do his best. Du Yuesheng declined again and again. Later, Dr. Zhou from Nanjing testified on the spot that Du Yuesheng was indeed unable to cope with overwork. Councilor Zhu Yixuan also said: "Councilor Du is the popular choice, but since he is in poor health and firmly requests to resign, please hold a re-election in accordance with the law." The conference chairman immediately announced that a re-election for the Speaker would be held. The re-election began at 10:55 AM. The councilors filled out and cast their ballots again. 168 ballots were issued and 168 ballots were received, which Feng Youzhen reported as consistent. The result of the vote was that Pan Gongzhan was elected Speaker with an absolute majority (154 votes). The remaining vote counts were as follows: Wu Shaoshu 3 votes, Du Yuesheng 2 votes, Tao Baichuan 2 votes, Wang Xiaolai 2 votes, Xi Yushu 1 vote, Zhu Yixuan 1 vote, 1 blank vote, and 1 invalid vote.

Mayor Wu announced the election results again, saying: Pan Gongzhan was elected Speaker, and Xu Jiyun was elected Deputy Speaker. After the Speaker and Deputy Speaker took the oath of office on stage, the ceremony was declared complete. It was 11:25 AM.

### Telegram of Respect to the Chairman

The full text of the telegram of respect to the Chairman passed by the Municipal Council is as follows: Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the National Government of Nanjing: This council was established on August 13th. All councilors were sworn into office and elected the Speaker and Deputy Speaker. We admire your leadership, your dedication to national construction, and your leadership in promoting the Founding Father's teachings and advocating for democratic governance. This council admires and accommodates diverse opinions, gathers collective wisdom, supports municipal administration, and promotes public sentiment. With sincerity and devotion, we offer our contributions to alleviate your hard work and serve as reliable support. We respectfully submit this telegram to express our sincere respect. Pan Gongzhan, Speaker of the First Shanghai Municipal Council, Xu Jiyun, Deputy Speaker, and all councilors jointly kowtow (August 8th) Yuan (August 13th).

[Another Report] After the successful conclusion of the inaugural meeting of the First Shanghai Municipal Council yesterday afternoon, Mayor Wu specially hosted a banquet at the Yiyuan Grand Hotel for all the councilors and more than 40 reporters from various newspapers who attended the ceremony and reported on the news. Everyone enjoyed the occasion and dispersed in high spirits.

### First August 13th After the Victory of the War of Resistance, Public Training Students in This City Commemorate Martyred Heroes, Wu Tiecheng and Yang Hu Personally Preside Over, Cornerstone Laying Ceremony for the Memorial Tower Held in the Afternoon

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Public Training Students Association, in order to commemorate the heroic martyrs who died in the War of Resistance, specially held the Memorial Service for the Martyrs of the Shanghai Public Training Students in the War of Resistance at the Great Guangming Theater on the first "August 13th" Songhu War of Resistance Memorial Day after the victory. At 9:00 AM yesterday morning, a plain archway was erected at the entrance of the Great Guangming, and wreaths and elegiac couplets were spread throughout the courtyard. The top was decorated with white embroidered cloth curtains, and the horizontal plaque with the Chairman's own inscription of "Encourage Steadfastness Together" was hung in the center. On both sides were the elegies by Bai Chongxi, "Heroic and Admirable", and Chen Cheng, "Righteousness Reaches the Clouds". Under the party and national flags, the portraits of the fourteen martyrs were reflected under a pair of serene white candles, making people stand in awe. The memorial service began at 10:20 AM. Wu Tiecheng, Yang Hu, Xuan Tiewu, Wu Guozhen (represented by Wu Kaixian), Li Xiangqi, and Tao Yizhi served as the main sacrificial group. After playing mourning music and performing the rituals solemnly, Wu Tiecheng first presented the wreath and read the instruction of the Chairman of the National Government. Then, Xie Chunpu, leader of the Public Training Investigation and Registration Group, read the eulogy. Li Xiangqi, former Director of the Public Training Office, reported on the past situation of organization and training and the participation in the war.

Wu Tiecheng's Eulogy

Later, Wu Tiecheng, the former Mayor of Shanghai, delivered a speech, saying: The participation of Shanghai's trained citizens in the War of Resistance is commendable and moving. Today, all of you present were personally trained and once protected Shanghai with the predecessors and heroes. I extend my utmost respect to you. China is now a free and independent country. This is a golden opportunity to build a new China. Centuries of history tell us that "cities" are the places where democratic politics originate. Shanghai has the most complete conditions among the cities in China. It is the economic and industrial center of the country. Therefore, I hope that the citizens of Shanghai, especially the trained citizens, will build the country with the spirit of "August 13th" anti-aggression. If all the citizens of Shanghai can unite, cooperate, help each other, and jointly seek the welfare of the entire Shanghai, then I believe that local democratic politics will be successfully tested by the citizens of Shanghai first! I hope that Shanghai will be a model of local democratic politics in the country, gradually promoting it, and building a truly democratic new China that is governed by the people, for the people, and owned by the people. After Wu's speech, Yang Hu, former Commander of the Songhu Garrison, and Xuan Tiewu, the current Garrison Commander, successively delivered speeches, praising the spirit of sacrifice of the martyred heroes and encouraging those who survived to continue their efforts.

### Unable to Speak, Overcome with Grief: The Bereaved Family's Tearful Words Move Hearts

Finally, Ms. Bai Jianfen, a representative of the bereaved family of the martyrs, delivered a speech of thanks. As Ms. Bai ascended the sacrificial altar, sorrow overwhelmed her. Before she could even open her mouth, she was already sobbing uncontrollably, barely managing to compose herself. However, the sounds she uttered were fragmented, each word accompanied by tears, deeply moving the hearts of those present. Many members of the presiding group and guests were moved to tears as well. Ms. Bai Jianfen is the daughter of Bai Mengze, a member of the Public Training Corps who died heroically in the war to defend the motherland. Bai left behind a son and two daughters, whose livelihoods depend entirely on their elderly grandmother, living in utmost poverty. Bai Jianfen has now graduated from high school, and her younger sister has also completed junior high school. However, due to a lack of funds for tuition, she will be forced to drop out of school next semester. In addition to expressing her gratitude to the guests, Ms. Bai also requested the following four points be conveyed to the government: (1) Issue certificates and medals to the deceased martyrs as a lasting memorial. (2) Please provide long-term compensation to ensure the survival of the bereaved, young and old. (3) Establish schools for the children of the bereaved, so they may avoid the hardship of being unable to attend school. (4) Currently, only a little over a hundred martyrs are registered. There must be many omissions. Please widely solicit registrations from all sectors of society to comfort the heroic souls of the deceased. The memorial service ended at twelve o'clock. After the meeting, former Mayor Wu Tiecheng personally approached the bereaved families, inquiring about Bai Jianfen's address in detail and promising to do his best to help.

Foundation Stone Laid After the Memorial Tower Meeting

After the meeting, according to the planned schedule, the group marched collectively to the Old West Gate in the Nanshi district to hold the groundbreaking ceremony for the Public Training Corps Anti-Japanese War Memorial Tower. Led by a band, the procession turned east from Da Guangming Road, turned onto Nanjing West Road, and arrived at the Old West Gate at 12:40 PM. Many citizens stood by the roadside to watch. The ceremony began at 1:20 PM, still presided over by Wu Tiecheng. He briefly stated that the construction of the memorial tower was only to express admiration for the spirit of the martyrs who sacrificed themselves for the country, so that those who came after would make even greater contributions to the nation and the people. Then, Battalion Commander Tao Yishan reported on the Public Training Corps' participation in the Anti-Japanese War and the historical account of covering the retreat of the National Army during the "August 13th" Battle. After the speech, the groundbreaking ceremony began. Wu Tiecheng, Li Xiaoqi, and Tao Yishan stood facing the yellow earth, which was covered with a Republic of China flag with a blue sky, white sun, and a red earth, and a wreath. Before the groundbreaking, the national flag and wreath were removed. Wu held a hoe, and Li and Tao each held a shovel. Music resounded, firecrackers burst, and reporters scrambled to capture the scene with their cameras. Finally, Wu led everyone in shouting slogans such as "Long Live the Republic of China," "Long Live Chairman Chiang," and "Long Live Shanghai," after which the meeting ended.

In addition, Secretary-General Wu specially held a tea party at the Kangle Restaurant yesterday afternoon to receive the relatives of the martyrs.

### Investigation Team Sends Letter to Police Bureau: Wang Zhuchen Detained, Decision to Transfer Entire Case to High Prosecutor's Office

[Reported by This Newspaper] As a result of the investigation by the investigation team for days of Wang Zhuchen's concealing of enemy and puppet supplies case, the evidence is deemed conclusive. It has been decided to transfer all case files and documents to the High Prosecutor's Office today, and a public letter to the Police Bureau will be sent to detain Wang. According to the two committee members responsible for the investigation of the case, Zhang Qingzhen and Wu Wangji, the suspicious points of this case are: (1) The "Special Repair Office of the Garrison Headquarters" claimed by Wang Zhuchen was denied by the Garrison Headquarters. (2) The Garrison Headquarters has no right to handle or receive enemy and puppet industries. In addition, the investigation team has issued an official document to the police and military agencies requesting the detention of Wang Zhuchen, but it has not been executed as of yesterday for five days.

[News Report] According to the spokesperson of the Receiving and Investigation Team: Because this team lacks administrative staff, if citizens have complaints in the future, they need to copy a duplicate to reduce the procedures of this team. If the content is an ordinary civil or criminal litigation or non-litigation event, and the petition is not within the authority of this team, this team may notify the plaintiff through the secretariat according to the Regulations on the Receipt of People's Petitions by the Supervisory Yuan and return the original. It is also stated that this team does not respond to cases, and the original plaintiff can inquire about the handling situation from this team in person if they want to understand the handling situation.

### Rong Desheng Petitions: Release Zhan Rongpei

[Reported by This Newspaper] The verdict of Rong Desheng's kidnapping case will be announced after Commander Xuan approves it. Yesterday, Rong submitted a written request to release Zhan Rongpei, the factory director of Shenxin. The petition stated that Zhan was only representing the contact for ransom payment and was innocent. At the end of the document was the name "Citizen Rong Desheng." This request was submitted to the Military Law Department of the Garrison Headquarters at around 5:00 PM yesterday.

### The Destruction of the Drug Trafficking Organization in Hequanfang

[Reported by This Newspaper] The District Prosecutor's Office recently received a secret report that a large-scale drug trafficking organization was located at No. 32, Hehefang, Lin Sen Road. The district dispatched prosecutors to supervise the many clerks and judicial police, etc., and armed them to go there, arresting Zhuang Hongzhi, Zhu Debiao, Liu Guangzhi, Zhu Youcai, Zhang Wenying, Gong Xiuting and other men and women, while the principal criminal Zhu Qishan was at large and has not been captured. Two large packages of opiuim, weighing more than 20 taels, more than 30 gold bars of various sizes, and other decorations were found in the room.

### Pan Gongzhan's Reply: Hoping that the Municipal Government Will Get the Assistance of Citizens in the Future to Restore Shanghai's Past Glory as a Commercial Port

Today, on Shanghai's historically significant memorial day, "August 13th," the first Provisional Municipal Council of Shanghai was established under the convocation of Mayor Wu. All members of this council took office under oath, with the presence and guidance of the heads of Party and government organs, Chinese and foreign guests. In particular, Mayor Wu, representing the Minister of the Interior, supervised the oath-taking and delivered instructions. Party Secretary Chen of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, Inspector Cheng, Dean Cha, etc., bestowed generous words of encouragement, which is deeply appreciated. I, having been erroneously elected by my colleagues, am honored to deliver this reply as a representative.

Shanghai is the center of China's economy and culture, and also a major metropolis in the world. Every move affects not only the entire country, but is also observed by the international community. Having been entrusted by 3.5 million citizens, taking a seat on the council to promote autonomy and assist municipal administration is a responsibility that truly fills me with apprehension. After eight years of enemy and puppet devastation, the material damage is immeasurable, while the corruption of customs and the decline of morality are even more heartbreaking. Now is the time when national construction is in need of the best. We deeply feel that the restoration work of this city is not limited to material construction, but must go further to eliminate all the toxins left by the enemy and puppets in the society in order to engage in psychological construction. However, after an unprecedented catastrophe, in terms of municipal construction, as the mayor said, we must all unite and work hard, thinking of the interests of the entire city, and earnestly engage in construction to achieve success. If we only rely on the government, its strength will be limited after all. If we do not mobilize all the citizens, gather strength, cooperate sincerely, uphold the spirit of supporting the Anti-Japanese War on August 13th nine years ago, and work hard for the construction and restoration in the future, it will not be enough to achieve complete success. Since we have been elected by the citizens and are supervised by the citizens, we must do our best to serve the city and the country, and fulfill our responsibility of expressing public opinion and participating in municipal administration.

After the restoration of this city last autumn, in March of this year, during the tenure of former Mayor Qian, a Provisional Council was established. Although it has only been four months, the Provisional Council has cooperated seamlessly with the government and society and made many contributions. Its achievements are obvious to all. Fortunately, the work of this council will have a good foundation in the future, and it will feel easier to promote it. We will also follow this example and continue to work hard. Mayor Qian, when the order of this city was roughly established and everything was waiting to be handled, compiled and reorganized the Baojia system and planned autonomy, so that the first popularly elected council of this city could be established one year after the victory. Today, we cannot but admire his administration, which is able to focus on the long-term and the big picture.

Furthermore, the Municipal Council is a deliberative body, and the Municipal Government is an executive body. The close relationship between the two is like the two wheels of a car or the two sides of an island. The reason why democratic politics can achieve brilliant achievements lies entirely in the good use of these two deliberative and executive bodies. In other words, the administrator must have the generosity to accept advice humbly, and then the politician can be a beneficial friend who is upright and knowledgeable. Only when the politician can make well-intentioned and positive criticisms can the administrator have a direction to rely on. Mayor Wu, with an open and honest and wise attitude, hopes for the cooperation of citizens in everything and is willing to respect the decisions of the Municipal Council. We are naturally obliged to contribute to the government with the public opinion of the citizens to be a sincere friend of the government. In the future, the municipal government and citizens will help each other, and the municipal facilities will accumulate day by day, creating a grand scene, attracting people from far and wide, and restoring the past glory of Shanghai as a commercial port in the near future and even surpassing it, which is our greatest wish. However, there are only 181 members of this council, and what we can see and hear is inevitably incomplete. We also hope that the local elders and social elites will give us advice at any time.

### Trial of Tianzhong and Six Other Criminals for Killing American Flying Tigers

Lieutenant General Tianzhong Jiuichi, the former commander of the Japanese 23rd Army and former Governor of Hong Kong, who was accused by the US military court of killing US Flying Tigers Major John Hock, and his staff members, were publicly tried by the US military court in Tilanqiao yesterday. Tianzhong Jiuichi, who led the army to station in Hong Kong and killed innocent people, was extremely frustrated when he was tried yesterday, his eyebrows were tightly locked, and his eyes were dull under his tortoise-shell glasses. During the two-hour trial, he never raised his lowered head. Major General Fudichi Harunan, his chief of staff, was also accused of the same crime, but Fudichi's expression was very different from Tianzhong's. In an extremely uneasy situation, he still could not conceal the anger in his heart, and stared at the people in the court. Other Lieutenant Colonel Kuboki Hinode, Major Watanabe Masamori, Captain Yamaguchi Norikazu, and Captain Asakawa Hiroko also showed fierce appearances, giving the impression of "murderers." The presiding judge asked each of the defendants about their crimes, and the six people from Tianzhong below all loudly answered "Not guilty." The defendant's defense lawyer, Bao Ding, requested the court to grant him three days to prepare, and the retrial was scheduled for 8:00 AM on the 16th of this month.

### Huang Liewen Retried Yesterday for Persecuting Martyr Du Ganglie: Xi Yushu Testifies in the Case of Chen Jicheng

[Reported by This Newspaper] Huang Liewen, the former puppet Qingpu County magistrate, was prosecuted by the High Prosecutor's Office for collecting white rice to harm the locality and secretly reporting to frame the former Secretary-General of the Municipal Party Department, Du Gang, and other crimes. The High Court has repeatedly held hearings for investigation. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Qiu took the seat to inquire, and Du's wife, Lu Huiming, and Ms. Zhang Yulin, who witnessed Huang Liewen writing the intelligence report about Du Gang, were present to explain the process in detail. Huang's confession was quite contradictory and he flatly denied the premeditated secret report about Du Gang. He also said that he had contacts with underground workers and had three letters stored in Li Yejiqing's place, which could be used as proof. Li Yejiqing was then asked to testify, and he stated: He and Huang were classmates at Fudan University in 1928, so they knew each other. In May or June of last year, he had a few letters stored in his place, which were later confiscated by the Military Statistics Bureau. Witness Zhang Yulin testified: Her husband was doing underground work in Shanghai at the time and knew each other. At 4:00 PM on October 29, 1943, she went to Huang's house. Huang Liewen showed her a paper, which read "Intelligence, Du Gang has come to Shanghai from Tunxi, Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Party Department" and said to her: I can succeed in this matter, and my life can be solved. Because Huang was poor at the time and wanted to find something to do. A month after Du Gang was arrested, she and her husband were also arrested by the enemy's Gestapo on Jules Ferry Road. According to the translator in the team, it was all instigated by Huang Liewen. Du Lu Huiming stated: She and Du Gang were arrested at the same time on November 10, 1943. Du was killed on the 17th. She was detained for many days before being released. Now she has six children and her life is difficult. Huang accumulated wealth during the enemy puppet period. Can a civil lawsuit be attached? The court ruled that special criminal cases cannot be attached to civil lawsuits. The case was postponed for retrial, and relevant enemy gendarmerie will be summoned from the war criminal management office for cross-examination.

Also, in the case of Chen Jicheng, the puppet ambassador to Manchukuo, Xi Yushu and Ye Chuanxi testified yesterday afternoon that they were arrested by the enemy and puppets at the time, and the defendant tried to rescue them and was released. The court ruled that the case would be retried on another date.

Huang Heting, Zhang Jinbao, Wu Jincai, etc. will be tried on the same day. After the interrogation, the trial will be postponed for retrial.

[Another News] The High Court originally scheduled to open an investigation court yesterday afternoon to interrogate Wu Yunzhai, the chairman and general manager of "Xinwen Bao," a suspected traitor.

### The Principal Criminal in Counterfeiting US Dollars, Swiss National Wei Delai, Arrested: The Cunning Rabbit Has Three Burrows, Repeated Serious Crimes, Maps and Codes Were Found, He is Actually a Traitor and War Criminal

[Reported by This Newspaper] Yesterday, a certain English newspaper in this city stated: Chinese and American police jointly searched a certain apartment at No. 54 Daxi Road, and the tenant lost millions of yuan in property. For this reason, the reporter specifically visited the spokesperson of the Garrison Headquarters. According to the report, the truth of the matter is as follows:

The Investigation Department of the Garrison Headquarters recently received a secret report from a certain foreigner stating: "A Swiss national named Wei Delai has committed serious crimes repeatedly. The counterfeit US dollars recently on the market were manufactured by him." After receiving the report, the Garrison Headquarters cooperated with a certain military agency. After a considerable period of investigation, it was learned that the suspect lived at No. 284 Youninggan Road, his wife lived at No. 54 Daxi Road, and he had an office at No. 83 Xieqiao Lane, using the stamp business as a cover. His relevant locations included the second house at No. 2423 Bailinan Road, etc. During the investigation, the US military also provided the suspect's criminal record in Shanghai for the past 20 years. It was decided to arrest this person at dawn on the 12th of this month, and a detailed search of his own residence, his wife's residence, his office, and several relevant locations revealed many pieces of evidence of the suspect's crime, which were largely consistent with what the original reporter said and the information provided by the US military. Except for those that are still under investigation and cannot be announced, the main ones are: (1) Evidence that he stole a huge amount of copper entrusted to the United States for safekeeping and sold it to the enemy for use. (2) Photos of counterfeiting my country's five-yuan stamps. (3) Original photos of Chongqing Longmenhao and Huangshan (Huangshan is the location of the Chairman's official residence) taken with a hand-held camera, enlarged photos, and a complete set of maps according to the size of the photos. (4) Special passes issued by the Special Service Class of the Japanese Shanghai Naval Special Landing Force and the Headquarters of the Japanese Enemy Third Fleet and Enemy Soldiers, and noting that he was allowed to take photographic photos, which are evidence of treason. (5) A letter from Lieutenant Hanabusa of the Enemy Naval Special Service introducing him to Lieutenant Colonel Omura of the Japanese Army Special Service for work, which contains many valuable secrets. (6) A manual written in code (under study). (7) Steel plates for manufacturing US dollars and parts of printing presses (this document is delayed due to time constraints). (8) Evidence that the suspect was expelled from Swiss nationality by the Swiss government for repeatedly committing crimes in various places.

A White Russian Refuses to Arrest and is Injured

In this case, the arrest and search were carried out by the Garrison Headquarters in conjunction with a certain investigation agency, and the foreigner who made the report issued a guarantee to the person in charge of the Investigation Department, and obtained the cooperation and assistance of the US Military Police Commander. Except for a few plainclothes personnel, the remaining Chinese and American personnel were all in uniform. When they arrived at No. 54 Daxi Road, the suspect's wife clearly knew that they were military police personnel, but after knocking on the door, she did not respond for a long time, apparently trying to destroy evidence. Therefore, the military police personnel took coercive measures to enter. At this time, a White Russian man dared to openly shoot to resist arrest. In order to protect himself, the action personnel mistakenly thought that this person was Wei Delai himself and immediately fought back, resulting in the man being shot in the leg and slightly injured (he has been sent to the hospital for treatment). After completing the inspection, all action personnel asked the inspected households to clean up and see if there were any lost items (only one family unreasonably refused to sign.) Each action personnel also checked each other's bodies on the spot and signed each other for the record. Therefore, the claim in the Western newspaper that the tenant lost his watch and US dollars is a misunderstanding.

The suspect Wei Delai is currently under interrogation, and the other two White Russians who were arrested were found to be unrelated to this case and have been released.

Electric Shock Causes Three Injuries

Disguised Dance Hall Managers Fined and Released on Bail

[Reported by This Newspaper] The Municipal Police Department has ordered the various sub-bureaus to strictly enforce the ban on the dance hall manager system, which has been issued by Fang Zhichao, the chief of the Administrative Police Department. However, in recent days, there are still a few dance halls that are superficially compliant but secretly disobedient, calling them dance hall administrators. The Laozha Sub-bureau arrested more than a dozen of these disguised dance hall managers at the Central Palace No. 2 Dance Hall the night before, took them to the bureau for punishment, fined them for violating police regulations, and released them on bail.

Impersonating Police Officers for Extortion

[Reported by This Newspaper] A young woman named Lin Zhaodi was selling watches and other items in the Bund area.

She pleaded bitterly to no avail, so she followed him to Pier No. 4, where she met a police chief on the way and reported the situation. After questioning, Zhu's words were inconsistent, and the original two watches were immediately found on him. Witnesses were arrested and taken to the Huangpu Sub-bureau. After interrogation, it was learned that Zhu had committed two previous cases, and two cigarette bubbles were found in his pocket, and he admitted to smoking opium without denying it. It is reported that the bureau will transfer him to the court for trial on charges of impersonating public officials for extortion and smoking opium.

### Hao Gengsheng's Return: Thoughts on Inspecting Northeastern Education: Extensive Damage to Northeastern Educational Facilities; Educational Reconstruction Will Be Faster Than in the Interior

[Our Nanjing Correspondent] Hao Gengsheng, an inspector appointed by the Ministry of Education, arrived in Shenyang by plane on the 15th of last month, tasked with inspecting education in the Northeast. Last Saturday, Hao returned to Nanjing, and reported to the Ministry of Education on Monday (12th) morning. During the memorial week, he gave a brief report. A more detailed account of his inspection will be given during next Monday's memorial service. Our reporter inquired about his impressions of the inspection, and he responded as follows: Hao's trip was not for physical education inspection, but for inspecting the education situation at all levels in the Northeast provinces. In Shenyang, he inspected dozens of higher education institutions above vocational schools, as well as primary and secondary schools. After completing the inspection of higher education institutions, he gathered the students and gave them temporary lectures. The Northeast Temporary University remedial class is still providing remedial education. Some of the students from Northeastern University who had relocated to Sanhe during the war have returned to the school. The university's president, Zang Qifang, is actively preparing for reconstruction. He then inspected over a dozen universities and primary and secondary schools in Changchun. Previously, there were the Jian Guo University, the Institute of Technology, and the Medical College. Now, only the Medical College of Changchun University remains. The Ministry of Education has dispatched Director Huang Rujin to prepare for the establishment of Changchun University. Hao communicated with Huang, and Huang has already set off for Changchun to begin preparations for Changchun University. Next, he inspected education at all levels in Yongji. Yongji is the capital of Jilin Province. During the puppet Manchurian era, there was a Teachers' University. It is now planned to be reorganized into Changbai Normal College. The Ministry of Education has dispatched Fang Yongzheng to be responsible for the preparations. He then inspected seven or eight primary and secondary schools in Sipingjie. Sipingjie is a county town in northern Liaoning Province, formerly the center of the Japanese South Manchurian Railway warehouse area, and its education has appropriate facilities. He then returned to Changchun, transferred to Shenyang, and went to Beiping, where he met with colleagues in the education sector to discuss educational matters, after which he returned to Nanjing. Hao remarked that his impressions from this trip were as follows: Upon first arriving in the Northeast, he felt that the educational facilities had suffered extensive damage, and that reconstruction would be quite difficult, which caused him some concern. Later, after having extensive conversations with educators and staff actually engaged in educational work in the Northeast, and meeting with students for observation, his mentality suddenly changed. He found that the general enthusiasm of staff and students for reconstruction was extraordinarily high. If this pure mindset could be harnessed to collectively advance towards the future of education, reconstruction would not be difficult. He also realized that although there had been destruction in the past, the future reconstruction could utilize and restore the original foundations, making reconstruction not too difficult either. Based on the above two situations, he felt that if the effort were made in time, the reconstruction of education in the Northeast would be promising and faster than the general education construction in the interior. It is a matter of human effort. His initial feelings of worry turned into joy and a sense of hope.

### First National Education Demonstration Zone: Implementing Literacy Methods for the People

The First National Education Demonstration Zone in this city, in order to comply with the implementation of the first phase of literacy education for out-of-school citizens and to increase the efficiency of various schools' implementation, has formulated the following methods:

Visual Publicity

A. (Slogans): Use proverbs or simple phrases to create slogans, with cartoons related to the meaning of the words attached to the top or bottom, to attract the reader's attention. The slogans should include: (1) Illiteracy is like being blind with open eyes, (2) Illiterates cannot be considered sound citizens, (3) Illiteracy brings a lifetime of suffering, (4) Illiteracy is truly suffering; many things cannot be done, (5) Workers who are literate can improve their work, (6) Farmers who are literate can improve agriculture, (7) Husbands should teach their wives to read and write, (8) Learn as long as you live, (9) Don't be afraid of being old, only afraid of not wanting to learn, (10) A family where everyone is literate is a truly happy family, (11) Not eating makes you hungry, but illiteracy is even worse, (12) If you didn't study in childhood, make up for it quickly in adulthood, (13) More knowledge brings more happiness, (14) Eating can satisfy hunger, but reading can clarify principles, (15) If you have the time, go read, reading has many benefits, (16) One word is worth a thousand gold pieces; literacy is most important, (17) Illiteracy is truly pitiful; you have to ask people about everything, (18) Literacy has many benefits; you can read newspapers and books, (19) Only with knowledge are you qualified to be citizens of a democratic country, (20) When the people have knowledge, the country will be strong. B. (Wall Posters): Wall posters should be published by August 15th, at least one issue, with at least two copies per issue, posted in prominent areas near the school. The content of the wall posters should include the key points of the central government's and the city's laws and regulations on the promotion of literacy education, as well as survey statistics and news related to literacy education, and the enrollment methods of the adult education classes in each school. Illustrations and charts should also be included to attract the reader's attention. C. (Pictures): Illustrate the significance of literacy and the suffering of illiteracy with large-scale illustrations, preferably compiled into a series of story pictures, and post them in key locations near the school or in public gathering places such as teahouses. D. (Advertisements): Explain the importance of literacy education in clear Chinese characters, then describe the enrollment regulations: age, gender, number of places, treatment, duration of study, class times, etc. The Baozhang and the Principal should jointly sign these enrollment advertisements, print many copies using mimeograph, and post them throughout the school's educational district.

Verbal Publicity

A. (Publicity Team): Each school should appoint one to three teachers (or rotate them) to lead a publicity team of several senior students or adult senior class students, forming one to three publicity teams. They should go to public gathering places in the educational district, such as teahouses and temples, to give public speeches and invite local people to assist them. The publicity team should have a small flag, a copper bell, and tools to summon the audience, such as a phonograph. They should bring copies of the enrollment advertisements and slogans to post at any time to attract public attention. B. (Lectures): In addition to the publicity team, each school should hold lectures on a regular basis and invite local Baojia leaders to participate. The location can be at the schools or at nearby public venues. It should be arranged in advance and, if possible, include performances such as parades, music, and slides to attract people.

Individual Persuasion

After the textual and visual publicity and verbal publicity, there are still out-of-school citizens who may hesitate to come forward, so individual persuasion should be implemented. The methods are as follows: (A) Encourage and introduce current students. If enrollment in the adult education classes in each school is insufficient, current students (children in older age groups and adult students) should be required to persuade at least one out-of-school citizen to enroll, and they should be given appropriate rewards. (B) Jointly persuade households with Baojia leaders. Based on the results of the survey of out-of-school adults in this district, if there are still many who have not registered for enrollment, the implementation measures for encouraging learning stipulated in this district should be followed. Baojia leaders should jointly persuade households to register on their behalf. If they still do not enroll by the opening date, the District Office should be notified to handle the matter.

Class Start Date

The adult education classes in each school in this district should comply with the regulations of the Bureau of Education and start classes by August 16th at the latest. The publicity period has already begun on August 5th and will last until the start date of classes. If there are still not enough students, persuasion should continue to be implemented to ensure that the required number of people is reached to meet the predetermined goals. Each school should fill out a report form (form attached separately) on the progress of publicity and enrollment by August 20th and report it to the district office for compilation and reporting to the Bureau of Education.

### The Negotiation Process of the Petition Delegation: Agreement in Principle, Methods Still Under Study; Utmost Concern is Currency and Prices

[Our Newspaper Report] Our reporter recently visited Mr. Pan Shihao, a representative of the Industry and Commerce Petition Delegation, and inquired in detail about the process of this petition to the capital. He provided detailed information regarding the five points: Separate taxation, foreign exchange, import and export trade linkage system, industrial loans, and direct and local taxes. Representatives from the government side agreed in principle on the two major principles of reducing the import of foreign goods and protecting domestic nascent industries. The Ministry of Finance believes there are two conditions! (A) While reducing the import of foreign goods, machinery and essential raw materials should still be opened up as much as possible. (B) The reduction of foreign goods imports should not stimulate domestic prices, as some in the government observe that the import of inexpensive foreign goods has some positive effect.

### Tariff Modification Certain; Export Taxes to be Completely Exempted; Fewer Freely Imported Goods

In addition, the Ministry of Finance's opinions can be divided into the following three points: (1) In the international arena, the victorious nations plan to convene an international trade conference in London this October. Before the victory, these belligerent nations had already verbally agreed that free trade and tariff freedom should be implemented after the war. Therefore, tariffs can be revised, but not under the guise of protective tariffs to avoid international misunderstandings. (2) The current tariffs were set in the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934). At that time, under the pressure of Japanese aggression, preferential treatment was given to the import tax on cotton textiles and paper. The Ministry of Finance has now decided to revise this. Furthermore, to encourage exports, export taxes will be completely exempted. (3) Before the tariffs are revised, it is planned to amend the current provisional measures for import and export trade to supplement them. The items on the Category A Table, Section 2, regarding items subject to a 50% luxury surcharge on current tax rates, and the items on the Category B Table, which are prohibited luxury imports, will all be increased. In other words, the number of freely imported goods will be reduced. Finally, the responsible person from the Ministry of Finance reiterated: The current tariffs do not conflict with protective policies and fiscal policies. Therefore, considering fiscal revenue, protective meaning should also be included.

The Ministry of Economic Affairs also has three points of opinion on tariff policy: (1) Increasing the import tax on luxury goods will definitely be implemented. However, there is concern that the increased tax still will not be able to balance the difference between the market for foreign goods and the market for domestic goods. Therefore, it is necessary to promote consumption and thrift domestically, which is the fundamental principle. (2) They hope that domestic goods will be used more and foreign goods will be used less. This is the same as the opinion of the delegation. However, due to the lack of domestic goods and the low purchasing power of the people, they do not agree with strictly restricting imports. As for the need to protect nascent industries, the situation should be examined closely, and different treatment should be given; a one-size-fits-all approach is not appropriate. However, in principle, the Ministry of Economic Affairs also agrees to provide appropriate protection to maintain national industries. (3) The Sino-American Commercial Treaty has now been submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review. Temporary commercial measures are also being drafted with Canada. It is reported that the principle adopted is still international free trade.

### Foreign Exchange is Not Easily Changed; Efforts to Avoid Stimulating Prices; Restrictions on Foreign Cotton, Implementing Cotton Loans

The delegation believes that the current US dollar exchange rate quoted by the Central Bank has increased six hundredfold since before the war. American prices have increased three to fourfold since before the war, while domestic prices in our country have increased more than five thousandfold. Therefore, they earnestly explained that the unreasonable exchange rate creates a lower market price for foreign goods domestically and raises the excessively high price of export goods in foreign markets. Therefore, they believe that balancing international payments should start with balancing trade. The current foreign exchange policy is clearly inappropriate. However, any change in the exchange rate will stimulate prices, which is also undesirable. Therefore, they advocate adopting a foreign exchange tier system for the import of luxury goods and non-essential goods to increase their cost. The state can then use the income from this price difference to subsidize export foreign exchange. At the same time, the purchase price of export goods such as silk, tea, and tung oil in the domestic market should also be adjusted using tiered foreign exchange.

The Ministry of Economic Affairs also expressed agreement in principle with this proposal from the delegation. However, they believe that completely modifying the exchange rate now is not feasible. The implementation of tiered foreign exchange will be considered after consulting with the highest authorities and relevant departments, and the principle remains to avoid provoking foreign sentiment.

The Ministry of Finance believes that foreign exchange is still determined by the Four Banks Joint Treasury and the Central Bank. The Ministry of Finance also sympathizes with the idea of adjusting foreign exchange to protect the domestic national economy. However, the principle remains to avoid stimulating domestic prices and causing foreign misunderstandings. Furthermore, the delegation believes that foreign exchange futures are currently limited to three months. This short-term foreign exchange cannot help the import of machinery and heavy industrial products, but only induces the large-scale import of foreign surplus goods and luxury goods. They advocate remedying this. The Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Finance both attached great importance to this and promised to consider it. The delegation also noted that the current foreign exchange fund is limited, and cotton exchange settlements have exceeded 60% of the total exchange settlements. Textile mills currently have extremely abundant raw cotton inventories, but domestic cloth is more expensive than American cotton and no one cares. Therefore, they requested reducing the import of foreign cotton to cultivate the livelihood of cotton farmers. The Ministry of Economic Affairs indicated that it has decided to implement low-interest cotton loans and restrict the exchange settlement of cloth imports.

### Linkage System Generally Agreed Upon; Implementation Methods Awaiting Study; Import Linked to Export

The delegation believes that in recent months, the trade deficit has been too large, not only oppressing domestic national industries but also depleting the purchasing power of the entire national economy. Therefore, they advocate an import-export linkage system: only those who export can import, and those who import must export. Although the amounts do not necessarily have to be equal, the principle is to promote exports and reduce imports. The Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Finance both strongly agreed with this. However, they feel that implementation is very difficult, because very few companies engage in both import and export. However, they consider the delegation's suggestion of establishing an adjustment mechanism to connect the exchange of import and export goods to be feasible. The Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Finance stated that they would consider more effective methods to realize the function of this linkage. They also said: This system was implemented in the rear area during the War of Resistance. However, at that time, it was necessary to link from exports to imports, such as tung oil and tungsten. Now that foreign goods are being dumped, it is even more necessary to link from imports to exports to ensure that international trade is close to physical settlement. (To be continued)

### Bulls Sell at High Prices; Gold and Currency Prices Both Fall

Yesterday, due to the situation not being completely hopeless, the gold price slightly rebounded. It opened at 2,010,000, immediately encountered a wave of selling, and gradually weakened. It fluctuated greatly between 1,980,000 and 1,990,000 in the middle of the day. After 10:00 AM, the Central Bank allocated 40 bars at a price of 1,985,000. Subsequently, the selling pressure gradually increased, and the price steadily declined in a peaceful state. At noon, it fell to 1,970,000 before stabilizing slightly. The afternoon remained sluggish, and the result was a decrease of 48,000 compared to the previous close. Jewelry gold was reduced to 2,100,000. Pattern silver and silver dollars were flat. The implicit interest rate for call money remained at 10% to 13%.

Foreign exchange, including US dollars, also became dull. It opened at 2,630 yuan in the morning, but selling pressure increased and it declined. However, it struggled quite a bit around 2,590 yuan in the middle of the day. Later, the supply side became crowded again, and the gold market weakened and lacked support. At noon, it fell further to around 2,570 yuan. The afternoon continued to weaken slightly, resulting in a decrease of 70 yuan compared to the previous close. Hong Kong dollars initially stabilized and then weakened, falling from 585 yuan to 575 yuan. The result was also a decrease of 3 yuan. Hong Kong telegraphic transfers increased to 555 yuan to 565 yuan yesterday due to the reduction of telegrams. Indian exchange was 665 yuan to 675 yuan, with selling prices slightly reduced in the afternoon. British and American exchange rates remained unchanged.

Hong Kong gold prices yesterday were affected by Shanghai, with futures surging to 368.5 yuan. Based on this price, if the Shanghai telegraphic rate is calculated at 179, it is equivalent to a price of around 1,710,000 in the local market.

### Standardized Price Trading; Series Wu More Active

Government bond trading was slightly boosted, with Series C and Wu being more active. Transactions reached more than one million yuan face value. Unified Series C opened at 640 yuan, and the price fell to a low of 620 yuan, but finally rose slightly to around 640 yuan. Unified Series Wu continued to advance and was already on par with Unified Series C. As a result, compared to the previous close, Series A, B, and C were all flat, Series D rose slightly by 20 yuan, and Series Wu alone rose by 40 yuan.

### Chinese Stocks Meandering

The situation of Chinese stocks yesterday was relatively stable, with a lot of meandering and no special changes. The highest prices in the middle of the day were 694 yuan for Yong Yarn, 3,950 for Meiya, 225 yuan for Jingfu, 223 yuan for Xinguang, and 170 yuan for Qinxing. The lowest prices near noon were 673 yuan for Yong Yarn, 3,780 yuan for Meiya, 212 yuan for Jingfu, 210 yuan for Xinguang, and 157 yuan for Qinxing. At the close, they meandered again. Futures trading for Yong Yarn and Meiya was slightly higher than the spot market. Interest rates were reduced to 9% to 12%. Xinguang was threatened by Jingfu, but Jingfu still took the lead in the end. Although trading was still active, most of the transactions were settled by transfer, and the momentum was very short, without breaking free from the meandering. As a result, compared to the previous close, the five major hot stocks - Yong Yarn, Meiya, Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing - all rose slightly. Among the less popular small and medium-sized stocks, except for China-France being flat and Shijie weakening, the rest all improved slightly. Veteran stocks were flat.

Foreign stocks continued to hover at low prices. Without special stimulus, it is difficult to recover. Paper and steel industries had not fallen the previous day, and the market was slightly tighter yesterday. The rest struggled around the previous closing price, and the momentum was relatively stable. Jardine Matheson was more colorful because it was being absorbed by large yarn and flower traders. Transactions were still small. As a result, compared to the previous close, Jardine Matheson rebounded by half a percent, Beer and Guangya were slightly stable, Ewo Yarn and Yinglian were flat, and paper and steel industries weakened slightly.

### Yarn Prices Turn Flat; Grey Fabrics Tight

Yesterday, the yarn market was unable to rise. Customers from Tianjin, Guangdong, and other places did not continue trading and remained cautious, without continuing to purchase. Therefore, the various yarn counts became firm and then soft. The results varied, with ups and downs ranging from 5,000 to 10,000. People's minds were temporarily at peace.

Grey fabrics remained tight due to the depletion of spot goods. At the same time, the demand for fine cloth from private factories in Fujian, Zhejiang, Guangdong, and other places continued to come one after another. Therefore, 12-pound Dapeng cloth rose to 58,500 yuan, on par with the price of V-Dragon head cloth. Shilong cloth increased due to the increase in grey fabric, and the market price rose accordingly. The results were all increases of 500 to 1,500 yuan.

### Stock Exchange Brokers; Quotas to be Decided Tomorrow

[Our Newspaper Report] The Stock Exchange convened its tenth preparatory committee meeting yesterday at 4:00 PM. After a three-and-a-half-hour meeting, the initial review of all broker applications was completed. Today, several committee members appointed by the general meeting will organize them. The eleventh preparatory committee meeting will be reconvened at 4:00 PM tomorrow afternoon to conduct a re-examination and decide on the quotas, which will then be submitted to the ministry for approval.

### Medium and Low Grade Early Rice Slight Decrease; Edible Oil Market Situation Strong

Yesterday, more than 5,000 dan of rice arrived in the North and South markets, with more medium and low grades. Stores selected high-quality ones, leading to high prices for superior rice and sluggish sales for inferior rice. Medium grade early rice decreased slightly by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Early rice was also highly priced for good quality and sluggish for inferior quality. White Yuan goods were scarce and prices were flat. New early rice continued to decrease slightly by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. The number of goods arriving in the future is expected to gradually increase. Flour digestion was scattered and there was still no change. Foreign powder was also the same. Northern wheat still selected white wheat. Shantou, Xiamen, and Minjiang purchases were weak, and the trend was still to raise prices and kill inferior goods. Factories still rejected opening. New soybeans had some arrivals, and prices were stable. However, medium and inferior goods had no buyers and were reduced by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Due to the hot weather, the edible oil market had a lot of customers. Although goods from Qingdao did not flood in, factory supply was still acceptable, and the market was strong.

### Foreign Tea Firms' Sales are Thriving; New and Old Varieties are Accepted

Domestic sales of red and green tea have not declined to this day. Foreign firms, especially British and Indian firms, are still more active. New Zhu-Chen from Wuyuan has already been opened by the Ruichang Foreign Firm, with a total of 20 boxes traded at a price of 220,000 yuan per dan. As for the new Zhu-Chen from Weiping, 27 boxes were absorbed by the Meixing Foreign Firm at a price of 240,000 yuan per group. As for old varieties, 40 boxes of old Zhen-Mei were purchased by the Xiehe Foreign Firm, 56 boxes of old Zhen-Zhen were purchased by the Wuchang Tea Company, and 50 boxes of Bai-Lin old red tea were purchased by the Deda-Chang Tea Company. Other tea firms have also been active, and the trend is consistent and stable. However, Bai-Lin old red tea was strongly raised by sellers, resulting in an increase of 40,000 yuan per dan. According to news from Indian firms, recently, there has been a tendency to accept all old special tribute teas. In terms of price, the most popular is between 44,000 and 45,000 yuan per dan. Other fine Taiwan red teas around 70,000 yuan are also in high demand.

### Next Quarter's Special Import Goods; Registration Deadline at the End of the Month

The import quantities of five kinds of specially permitted import materials, such as automobiles, kerosene, tobacco leaves, movies, and foreign sugar, are applied for quarterly, three months per term. The next quarter is October to December. The deadline for registration is the end of this month. The Import Management Office will still handle the applied quantities and methods in accordance with the regulations of the highest competent authority. The applicants are still limited to the importers who applied and were approved before March 25 of this year. If the imported quantity registered in the first phase cannot be purchased in full before the end of September of this year, the special reasons must be explained. If it is found to be true after verification, it will be deducted from the quantity applied for in the next quarter.

### American Demand for Chinese Carpets is Quite High

[Reuters, New York, 13th] According to Hodge, Director of the Oriental Carpet Institute, American demand for Oriental carpets is higher than expected. The institute is conducting a publicity campaign to increase Americans' appreciation of Oriental carpets. Currently, not only the United States, but also Mexico and South American countries need Oriental carpets. Although most of the imports from China are pre-war products, at least one batch of post-war carpets has been shipped. However, China's inflation has greatly increased costs, which has greatly affected the sales of Chinese carpets in the United States.

### Chinese Bonds Fall in London Market

[Reuters, London, 13th] In the foreign stock market, Chinese bonds fell by two to three pounds today due to the impact of the unstable domestic situation.

### Procedures for Joint Treasury Loans; Order to Strive for Improvement; Soliciting Handling Fees is Strictly Prohibited

The Four Banks Joint Treasury, in order to improve loan procedures, has submitted to the Board of Directors for resolution: (1) Lending banks shall not require a bank guarantee from borrowers who have provided sufficient collateral in accordance with the regulations. (2) The government has regulations on handling fees for commercial firms, and it has been heard that there have been cases of extra solicitations recently, which should be transferred to the competent authority for thorough correction. It is reported that the above resolutions, in addition to the second item which has been transferred to the Ministry of Finance for investigation and handling, have also been telegraphed by the Four Banks Joint Treasury to the six general bank branches for compliance.

### Letters of Credit Not Allowed to Expire; Coal Exchange Must be Approved in Advance

The Central Bank issued Notice No. 50 on August 12 to all designated foreign exchange banks, stating: If the goods of customers for which the designated banks have issued letters of credit cannot be completed within the time limit specified in the certificate, the expired letter of credit shall not be extended or a new certificate issued to replace the expired certificate or unused portion of the certificate without prior approval from the Central Bank. If a client applies for an extension of an expired letter of credit or requests the issuance of a new certificate for the same batch of goods, it must be approved by the Central Bank in each case.

On the same day, Notice No. 51 was issued to all designated foreign exchange banks, stating: From today, foreign exchange shall not be sold for the import of coal and coal dust without prior approval from the Central Bank, and each designated bank is requested to immediately telegraph its foreign branches to comply.

### Ministry of Economic Affairs Submits a Request to Establish a Supervisory Office for Industry and Commerce

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] Considering that China has a vast territory and the economic situation varies from place to place, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has decided to establish industrial and commercial supervision offices in Chongqing, Panyang, Pingjin, Shanghai, Taiwan, and other places to facilitate the development of industry and commerce, with specialists supervising and inspecting. All issues such as industrial plant plans, technology, raw materials, and management can be assisted or consulted on free of charge. On the commercial side, export surveys and foreign commercial intelligence will be conducted. This plan will be implemented after approval by the Executive Yuan.

### Large Batch of Cotton Cloth Shipped to Guangdong

[Our Newspaper Report] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Yan-Sheng ship sailed south this afternoon, loading more than 7,000 pieces of cotton cloth for shipment to Guangdong. The Lin-Sen ship arrived in Shanghai from Shantou yesterday, carrying more than 10,000 pieces of native sugar and spirit paper from Shantou, and more than 10,000 pieces of wood from Fuzhou.

### Britain Reduces Silk Tax; House of Commons Accepts

[Reuters, London, 13th] The House of Commons has accepted a clause in the Finance Bill amendment that reduces the purchase tax. The Chancellor of the Exchequer explained that when proposing to reduce the purchase tax on natural silk from 100% to 33 and one-third percent, the distinction between natural silk, rayon, and other textile raw materials is difficult to identify. These amendments will therefore allow natural silk to become consistent with rayon. He also stated that the Ministry of Finance will increase the burden by one million pounds sterling annually due to the reduction of the purchase tax. The reduction of tax rates in the domestic market will assist the export trade of silk goods and maintain the employment problem in silk manufacturing areas.

### The First Air Force Day After Victory: Establishing a Foundation for the Air Force with Redoubled Efforts

— Zhou Zhirou

August 14th is the day the fighting Chinese Air Force was born. Upon reaching this day, we are both moved beyond words and endlessly invigorated. Each year becomes a milestone for the Air Force, marking the progress of our endeavors and the merits and demerits of our personnel. It implicitly and sternly urges us to truly become steadfast protectors of the nation and its people. We have already passed nine August 14ths, which also means we have passed the officially designated sixth Air Force Day. For these nine years, every time this blazing season arrives, there have always been different issues requiring us to come up with different methods to consider and resolve; there have also been different circumstances requiring us to adapt and accommodate with different efforts. Therefore, what remains is a variety of recollections and reflections, and the path forward is correspondingly distant and tortuous, laborious and time-consuming.

One Equaling Ten, Ten Equaling a Hundred

On August 14th of the 26th year of the Republic [1937], thirty-seven days after Japanese warmongers committed arson, on the second day of the fierce Battle of Shanghai, the Chinese Air Force, relying on its wisdom, benevolence, and courage, and using its blood, sweat, and steel, created an August 14th with a thunderous roar that shattered the sky!

At that time, the entire force of the Chinese Air Force consisted of nine groups: three fighter groups, three light bomber groups, two reconnaissance groups, and one attack group, totaling 305 aircraft of various types. In terms of quantity, this was equivalent to one-third of the enemy's regularly deployed forces. In terms of quality, because the units were all newly formed and their training was not yet proficient, both personnel and equipment were scarce. Moreover, because we could not produce these things ourselves, all resupply was extremely difficult, and maintaining our forces became a constant source of anxiety.

We knew all of this, and we feared none of it, because we took "one equaling ten, one equaling a hundred" as our creed. The determination to sacrifice had long taken root in the comrades' ardent hearts. With the outbreak of the July 7th Incident, the Air Force's anti-Japanese sentiment rose to a fever pitch. The vigor of the morale, the conscientiousness of the mission, are memories that remain eternally clear and indelible. Based on this momentum, the radiant August 14th was produced, and the unprecedented absolute victory of the opening battle was achieved, defeating the elite Kisarazu Naval Air Group of enemy heavy bombers over the wilderness of Jiangsu and Zhejiang with a score of zero to six.

Fighting Day and Night, Preferring to Be Shattered Jade

In the following three days, our fighter units shot down as many as forty-six enemy planes in one breath. In addition, the battle results of the bomber and reconnaissance units were also equally fruitful and gratifying. During the early days of the "holding the hard positions to the death" era of the Eastern Theater, the Air Force was constantly fighting, day and night, preferring that the entire army be shattered jade rather than retreat even slightly. Thus, one after another, astonishing and tragic stories remained among the people, laying the foundation for the spiritual invincibility of our national army.

The second August 14th was spent living through the defense war of Wuhan on the Yangtze River. From the spring to the autumn of the 27th year of the Republic [1938], from Nanchang to Yichang, in order to defend the territory, to protect the military and civilians, and to vertically blockade the Yangtze River, the Air Force displayed commendable battle results to the world. At that time, enemy planes shot down in one instance were counted in "tens." For example, in the Battle of Hankou on April 29th, the Emperor's Birthday, ten enemy bombers and eleven fighters were shot down in one engagement. Aerial combat was at its most intense at this time.

Subsequently, the battle lines shrank into mountainous areas, and the Air Force's bases were moved to Sichuan. The seaports were blocked, supplies decreased daily, and the focus of work shifted to urban air defense, with sorties mostly being used opportunistically under favorable circumstances. At the same time, looking at the overall world war situation, the enemy's flames were raging, and the Allied forces were retreating steadily. China was isolated inland, and resupply from overseas was completely hopeless. Furthermore, as the Soviet Union was preoccupied with its own affairs, support gradually diminished. Thus, under the pressure of a large force, we struggled painfully, living through the third, fourth, and fifth August 14ths.

By the sixth August 14th of the 31st year [1942], the situation had gradually improved. The world-renowned American Volunteer Group, under the direct command of our commander-in-chief, fought alongside us as one, constantly striking the enemy. At the same time, regarding personnel training and equipment resupply, the United States, in the guise of the "arsenal of the Allies" and the "transport corps of the Allies," actively assisted us in preparing for the general counteroffensive.

From the seventh August 14th in the 32nd year [1943] to the eighth August 14th in the 33rd year [1944], the Chinese Air Force had transformed from a disadvantage to a balanced position, and further from a balanced position to an advantage. Taking the Battle of Changde in November of the 32nd year [1943] as the turning point, we reversed the years of passive beatings and changed to seeking out the enemy to fight. From then on, through the Central Plains Campaign (April 23rd to July 18th) and the Hunan-Hubei Campaign (May 27th to August 10th) of the 33rd year [1944], and the enemy's last-ditch Gui-Liu Campaign, the Air Force either coordinated with the army or independently launched attacks, participating in almost every battle and winning almost every battle. Until the days around the ninth August 14th last year [1945], the enemy surrendered unconditionally (August 9th). The Air Force's emissary of surrender first flew to the capital (the first of our planes landed in Nanjing at 4:00 PM on August 25th), gloriously achieving victory and completing the arduous mission.

Small Amount of Equipment, Large Amount of Spirit

Clearly, we were victorious in the war. The losses suffered by the enemy's air force far exceeded ours. Although our capital for combat was only our full spirit and half, or even less than half, of the equipment, the results we achieved, if measured by the power exerted by one person, one plane, and one bullet, demonstrated that we had indeed made the greatest effort possible. Over the eight years, with our small mobile force alone (the following figures do not include the Allied air forces), we dispatched planes in 4,027 batches, used 18,509 aircraft, shot down 568 enemy planes, likely shot down 117, damaged 602, destroyed 597 enemy planes on the ground, possibly destroyed 10, damaged 137, killed 38,282 enemy officers and soldiers, 3,800 cavalrymen, 5,472 warhorses, sunk 30 enemy ships (including one aircraft carrier), damaged 42, and damaged 252 other vessels, damaged 1,347, destroyed 1,584 locomotives and cars, and 5,123 other vehicles, damaged 1,103. In addition, we also performed many missions destroying enemy positions and behind enemy lines, as well as transporting supplies and providing cover for our front lines.

As for the total consumption of the Air Force's equipment during the eight-year war of resistance, including training and various items, it amounted to 597 tons of bombs, 10,240,000 bullets. Personnel deaths in aerial combat numbered 827, with 332 missing and 970 wounded or disabled; ground personnel deaths numbered 3,123, with 1,541 wounded or disabled. Altogether, there were 6,794 casualties. The death rate for flight officers was 24.3% (meaning that on average, approximately one in every four Air Force officers died for the country; if casualties are combined, then one in every two Air Force officers was either killed or wounded). The death rate for ground crew was 3.4%.

Ground Preparation for Aerial Activity

In wartime, everything is for the sake of combat, but without ground preparation, there can be no aerial activity. In order to carry out aerial defense, and for the sake of future military construction, even amidst extreme difficulties, we have not forgotten to devote ourselves to comprehensive construction. First, in terms of personnel training, in addition to the existing aviation school and mechanical school, we established an Air Force Staff College, a Non-Commissioned Officer School, a Communications School, a Youth School, and other various professional training classes. Especially importantly, due to the material supply and educational equipment, we sent multiple batches of students abroad for advanced studies. Since the 29th year of the Republic [1940], we have sent a total of 4,426 flight and ground crew personnel to the United States to study. Among them, more than 1,000 have returned to the country to serve, and a small number have caught up with the war and made military achievements. The rest are scheduled to return home by the end of next year. At the same time, we specially sent 220 mechanical personnel to the United States for the aviation industry and 51 to England.

Secondly, in terms of material equipment, with the evolution of the war situation, we had to transform from simple peacetime facilities to actual wartime facilities in an unpredictably short period of time. Furthermore, in order to save time, we had to abandon the Southeast sea and land transportation and confine ourselves to the interior of Western China. The haste of deployment and the difficulty of resupply made people feel that the entire Air Force was in danger of withering and suffocating at any time. But even in such an environment, we still mustered our courage and fought hard, and continued to actively build. In the eight years, we successively established 16 general stations, 154 large and small airfields, 19 aircraft repair factories, 34 equipment and ammunition depots, 171 radio stations, 354 air defense intelligence stations, 94 meteorological groups, and no less than hundreds of research, manufacturing, food and clothing, medical, engineering, and transportation institutions. As for the manpower and material supplies implemented to assist the Allied armies, these have not yet been included in the calculations.

Thirdly, there are the institutional and cultural constructions. The Air Force is a completely new product with a short history, and everything has no precedents to rely on. However, the Chinese young Air Force has two major characteristics that can serve as guiding principles for military construction: namely, accepting from the beginning (1) the technical essence of the United States, and (2) accepting from the beginning the commander-in-chief's spiritual instructions. Therefore, whether in flying, mechanical, legislation, or education, we seek to find concrete and feasible paths under these two seemingly incompatible but not contradictory principles. We hope that more reasonable and nationally appropriate things can be produced successively from this effort.

Regarding institutions, the important aspects we have been working hard to build include personnel systems, management systems, education systems, and supply systems. In personnel matters, the Air Force's attitude is "strictness first." All examinations, promotions, awards, transfers, and retirements are striving to be standardized, and we will never be careless. In management, the Air Force's policy is "openness first." We have not only eliminated the shameful monopolistic system in form, but also in the execution of financial, material, food, and allowance supply matters, failing to handle matters in accordance with regulations and verifying them has become an unimaginable nightmare. Other aspects, such as educational policies, aerial activities, technical supplies, land and air transportation, airfield facilities, and military law, military medicine, and general affairs, tangibly refer to the U.S. military, creating laws and regulations. Intangibly, we follow instructions and cultivate customs, always seeking to reduce malpractices and get on the right track, to build a foundation for the Air Force.

Promote and Expand, Perpetually Maintain Victory

Resisting Japan is our heavenly duty. Building the army is also our responsibility. Everything is to fulfill our mission, everything is for the sake of the greater good. At this time, when the good dream of victory is about to come true, and the nation's crisis rises again, we—the few Air Force comrades standing at the forefront of military power—should all conduct thorough self-examinations in all aspects and deeply awaken ourselves. First of all, we must recognize that the small achievements we have made in the past are not only insufficient to be proud of, but should also be regarded as regrettable compared to our Allied nations. What the people expect from us, and what the government relies on us for, cannot be said to be insincere. However, our construction and our military strength are truly too weak when considering the vast territory and population, and the importance of our position. Especially worrying is the technological backwardness, which is like a strong man compared to a child; the smallness of production, which is no different from a hair compared to firewood. Now that the strong enemy has fallen, but our own progress is stagnant, and we cannot keep up with the times, then if we want to guarantee security on our own and achieve our ideals in reality, the future will inevitably be uncertain. Thinking about this cannot help but make us feel heavy-hearted. All young and strong Air Force members with ambition, ability, integrity, and promise will definitely promote the spirit of resisting Japan and move towards the road of building the army on their own, so that the fruits of victory can be preserved forever and a great future can be anticipated. This is what we must warn each other about and use to encourage ourselves during this festive holiday filled with excitement and celebration.

### Air Force Message: A Brief Commentary

The arrival of the first Air Force Day after victory coincides with the eve of the anniversary of Japan's acceptance of the Potsdam Declaration and the victory of the war of resistance. We remember the heroic martyrdom of our Air Force soldiers over the past nine years. As our mountains and rivers are restored and the enemy is defeated, we must first express our highest respect to them. The growth of China's modern Air Force has been very short. On the eve of the war of resistance, our Air Force's strength was really thin, and it was really incomparable to our powerful enemy at that time. However, under the conditions that our material conditions were inferior to others, our Air Force had glorious battles and sacrifices based on its heroic will and the spirit of serving the country, which is really the most precious page in our history of resistance. Today, we are happily celebrating the first Air Force Day after victory, remembering the heroic sacrifices of our Air Force soldiers who died for the country, and expressing our sincere condolences to their families. We hope that they can receive the comfort and care that the country should give them.

Now that World War II has ended, from the lessons of this war, we can clearly understand the importance of the mission undertaken by the Air Force in the entire war. Since the use of the atomic bomb, we have understood the importance of the Air Force's mission even more. How the war situation will be in the future, and how the realm of aircraft development will be, we cannot predict now, but in the establishment of modern national defense, the Air Force is undoubtedly a major part. Under this circumstance, we are excited to see the confirmation of the organization of the Air Force Headquarters of the Ministry of National Defense on the eve of Air Force Day. We hope that our new Air Force Headquarters can actively shoulder the mission of developing our Air Force. That is the most meaningful action to celebrate or commemorate Air Force Day.

### The First Anniversary of Victory: A Review of Japan's Surrender - Our Newspaper's Archives

On August 6th of last year, the United States dropped the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima. Two days later, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan. On August 9th, the second atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki. On August 10th, Japan formally requested Switzerland, Sweden, and the United States to convey to China, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union its acceptance of the Potsdam Declaration. By August 14th, World War II was declared over. On September 2nd, the Japanese Instrument of Surrender was signed on the USS Missouri, marking the official surrender ceremony. Ever since the September 18th Incident (Mukden Incident), Japan had been dreaming of a "Greater East Asia." Once awakened, all that remained was a shattered homeland and devastated territories. The aggressors truly found themselves in the tragic state of "reaping what they sow!"

After occupying the Japanese mainland, General MacArthur disarmed the nation, reorganized the government, dissolved the military and financial cliques, and supported democratic politics. All of these measures were intended to guide the Japanese people onto a new path. However, on the other hand, some were loudly proclaiming that Japan's latent war-making potential had not been eliminated, the power of the militarists had not been eradicated, and the so-called democratic parties were all figures who had previously been attached to the military. Time passes quickly. In just one short year, how the Allied nations have transformed Japan is what everyone is eager to understand. Today, we have specially compiled this article for review.

The Turnover of the Japanese Cabinet

The cabinet is the promoter of Japan's political future. The Potsdam Declaration stated: "A peacefully inclined and responsible government shall be established in accordance with the freely expressed will of the Japanese people." But could the Japanese cabinet over the past year truly fulfill the Potsdam Declaration, follow General MacArthur's orders, and establish a democratic and peaceful nation?

It took half a month after the Emperor announced the surrender for the Higashikuni cabinet to be formed. Having a member of the imperial family serve as the head of the cabinet was an unprecedented event in Japanese history. There was a reason for this. When Japan surrendered to the Allied nations, it still requested to retain the Emperor's position. The Allied nations only agreed to conditional preservation. But although the Emperor had to obey the orders of the Allied Supreme Commander, at least within the country, he could still maintain his dignity. Higashikuni came forward to form a cabinet, wanting to use his status as a member of the imperial family as a rallying cry. However, the Higashikuni cabinet could not cooperate with General MacArthur's orders externally, nor could it meet the demands of the majority of the people internally, and it collapsed in just one month.

After the Higashikuni cabinet fell, the veteran diplomat Kijūrō Shidehara succeeded it. Shidehara had served as Foreign Minister during the September 18th Incident and was ostracized by the military. Shidehara's skillful approach seemed more clever than Higashikuni's. After forming the cabinet, under General MacArthur's supervision, he implemented the terms that Japan should fulfill after its surrender, revised the constitution, reduced imperial power, increased parliamentary power, promulgated election laws, and held general elections, as an initial step towards democratic politics. On January 4th, General MacArthur ordered the purge of figures within government agencies who had been involved with the military. Many people were implicated, and the Shidehara cabinet was shaken, with rumors of a planned collective resignation. As a result, on January 12th, the cabinet was reorganized, and six cabinet members whose names were on the blacklist resigned. Five new cabinet members were appointed after General MacArthur's approval. On February 12th, it reorganized again due to General MacArthur's [illegible] decree.

After the general election on April 10th, calls for the cabinet to fall rose one after another. The result of this election was that Japan had become a multi-party system, but none of the major parties could hold a clear majority. The union and dissolution of major parties were enough to determine the fate of the cabinet. The Socialist Party first demanded the collective resignation of the Shidehara cabinet, followed by a joint campaign by the Cooperative Party, the Liberal Party, and the Communist Party to overthrow the cabinet. In its statement, it stated: "The Shidehara cabinet must resign and consult with various parties to seek political stability." However, Shidehara clung to his position, saying that even a collective resignation would not help the political situation. In the end, he could not ease the calls for the cabinet to fall, and on April 22nd, he submitted his collective resignation to the Emperor.

After the Shidehara cabinet dissolved, the successor was not determined for a long time. A coalition cabinet could have been formed based on the results of the general election, but the Socialist Party insisted on the position of Prime Minister, so it did not succeed. On the 26th, representatives from the Liberal Party, the Socialist Party, the Cooperative Party, and the Communist Party held a joint meeting, and there was a strong possibility that Ichirō Hatoyama, president of the Liberal Party, would come forward to form a cabinet, but in the end, because the Progressive Party was excluded and the Socialist Party fought for the position of Prime Minister, the negotiations broke down. In early May, the four parties agreed that the Liberal Party would form a cabinet alone, and Shidehara officially recommended Hatoyama as the successor Prime Minister. However, General MacArthur said that Hatoyama had served as the Chief Secretary of the Tanaka cabinet, formulated measures to maintain public order, had served as Minister of Education in the Inukai Tsuyoshi cabinet, suppressed freedom of speech, thought, and assembly, dissolved agricultural and labor organizations, and had consistently supported authoritarianism and acts of aggression, and explicitly ordered his dismissal. The new cabinet was thus thwarted again.

After more than 20 days of preparation, on May 16th, the Emperor finally ordered Shigeru Yoshida to form a new cabinet. Yoshida had ceded the presidency of the Liberal Party to Hatoyama on the 15th, seemingly still being part of Hatoyama's faction. However, from 1939 onwards, Yoshida had always opposed Hideki Tojo’s intentions.

The Material Crisis and the Economy

In post-war Japan, there was a lack of resources, and the people's livelihood was in decline. The quantity of fixed rationed goods was only half of what it was before the war. Most wealthy people obtained supplies from the black market. The prices of food and clothing were rising every day. A five-inch long small fish cost more than ten yen (equivalent to six US cents). The black market price of rice was 32 times higher than the official price. People in rural areas were in a better situation because they were engaged in production. Residents of large cities were all under threat, especially with the severe food crisis. Although the police tried to search for hoarded goods, it was still not enough. There was also a great lack of housing. The population of Tokyo was only one-third of what it was before the war, but there was still not enough housing to distribute. After Japanese expatriates returned to the country, they encountered difficulties everywhere. Putting aside eating and clothing, the first problem was that there was no way to live. The employment problem could not be solved either. Currently, there are more than 700,000 unemployed people in Tokyo alone. But there is a strange phenomenon: everyone is unwilling to go look for a job. At that time, there were several factories in Tokyo that needed more than 30,000 workers, but only a few responded to the call. Most people would rather be "runners," traveling between cities and villages, selling goods from both places to make a living. Factory wages were not enough to fill their stomachs.

On the one hand, there was a material crisis, and on the other hand, there was inflation. According to Japanese economists in mid-February, the banknotes issued by the Bank of Japan had reached 60 billion yen, but in November of last year, it was only 28 billion. On February 16th, in order to solve the crisis, the Japanese government issued a strict economic control order to tighten the money supply, restrict deposits and withdrawals, crack down on the black market, and adjust prices. After that, prices fell slightly, but the material crisis remained the same. The United States proposed a plan to help Japan restore production and build small factories. The Far Eastern Commission also agreed with Japan's economic self-sufficiency. When the Control Council for Japan discussed the issue of managing Japanese finances, it mentioned export methods and agreed to consider supplying cotton to maintain its textile industry. This facility naturally has a great impact on our country's industry under construction.

On the other hand, the Japanese who made fortunes during the war still spend money like water, without any stinginess, and entertainment venues are booming. In the income tax list, geishas ranked first, and many good women became prostitutes. In several major cities such as Tokyo, anything can be bought as long as you have money. This is Japan's post-war deformed prosperity.

Is Japan Likely to Recover?

Whether Japan can no longer be a threat to East Asian peace is indeed a question. In terms of armaments, although Japan's military has been disarmed, it is not thorough enough; the police and gendarmerie have not been touched at all, and weapons have not been completely surrendered. In politics, the Privy Council and the House of Peers still exist. The results of the election show that the majority Liberal Party and Progressive Party are the incarnations of the Seiyukai and Minseitō in the past. Economically, although General MacArthur ordered the purge of companies such as Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, and Katakura, they were only divided into joint-stock companies, and the monopoly organizations still control the country's economic life. Japanese soldiers are still trying to take the opportunity to rise again, and remnants of the Black Dragon Society are secretly active. In the waters of Tokyo Bay, huge amounts of gold and silver ingots were discovered, prepared as capital for recovery. On the surface, Japanese soldiers have become docile sheep, but in secret, they are carefully plotting revenge. When the Japanese army concentrated in Xiamen returned to the country, on the walls of the Xiamen University—concentration camp—school building, they saw the slogan "We will be back in twenty years." In the hearts of the Japanese people, they seem to be sincerely convinced by the United States, but not so for us. The "Shibuya Incident" that recently occurred in Tokyo is clear evidence of this. In this regard, in addition to strengthening the control of Japanese education, we ourselves must also be vigilant and work hard at all times.

Because their views were not in agreement, for six years Yoshida was in the opposition. The Yoshida cabinet is dominated by the Liberal Party, with the Progressive Party occupying a minority, which has a somewhat conservative nature. The Communist Party once criticized Yoshida for supporting [anti-] China when he was the vice minister of Foreign Affairs, and should be dismissed in the same manner as Hatoyama. The mission of the Yoshida cabinet is only to pass the draft constitution in the parliament and strive to maintain the imperial line, which is extremely beneficial to the ruling class. As for the serious food crisis and inflation and other issues, there is still no solution. The Tokyo Asahi Shimbun on the 16th advocated the rapid establishment of a democratic [defense], to confront the conservative cabinet.

Political Tendencies Towards Democratization

Over the past year, Japan has been busy organizing new political parties, drafting a new constitution, and implementing universal suffrage. Optimistically speaking, Japan has embarked on the road to democracy, but some people are still skeptical.

Under General MacArthur's guidance, the Japanese democratic movement seems very active. Many newly formed political parties, all claiming to be democratic. Among them, the more powerful are the Liberal Party, the Progressive Party, the Socialist Party, and the Communist Party. The Liberal Party is the incarnation of the former Seiyukai, and the Progressive Party is formed with the original Minseitō members as the center, representing the conservative faction. The Communist Party represents the left wing. Because they could not carry out activities publicly in the past, most Japanese turned to the Socialist Party, and their strength is not very large, but their radical views are also agreed upon by some people. The Socialist Party is between not left and not right. The remaining small parties are weak. Before the general election, Nozaka of the Communist Party advocated a united front, uniting the Socialist Party and other small parties to take unified action. But as a result, the Socialist Party did not join hands with him.

The political system is built on the constitution, and to reform politics, it is necessary to start with reforming the constitution. General MacArthur stated on September 12th of last year that the Japanese constitution must be revised. The Japanese government then engaged in revision, and on March 6th, it published a draft of the new constitution. The main points of the new constitution are to clearly limit the powers of the Emperor, establish the principle of popular sovereignty, stipulate the separation of legislative, executive, and judicial powers, and compared with the old constitution, it can be called progressive. After the draft of the new constitution was drafted, all political parties had opinions to express. In addition to the Liberal Party expressing full agreement, the Progressive Party and the Socialist Party were also generally satisfied, and the Communist Party raised many opinions. They are fundamentally opposed to retaining the Emperor system. Internationally, much attention was paid to Japan's new constitution. China and the United States generally agreed, while the Soviet Union raised several opinions and questioned the Far Eastern Commission. The Far Eastern Commission held a special meeting on July 2nd to conduct a final review.

After the activities of political parties and the revision of the constitution, the next step was to implement universal suffrage. The universal suffrage was originally scheduled to be held on March 30th, but in order to strictly review the qualifications of candidates, it was postponed to April 10th. This can be said to be Japan's first free election, and women, who have always been excluded, also gained the right to vote. The competition among the various parties was very heated. The election results showed that the Liberal Party won 138 seats, the Progressive Party won 95 seats, the Socialist Party won 92 seats, non-partisans won 83 seats, various small parties won 38 seats, the Cooperative Party won 14 seats, and the Communist Party won 5 seats. Afterwards, General MacArthur said that this election opposed the extremist faction and elected the central faction, and this is the [cabinet] most capable of serving the people. From this, it can be seen that democratic politics seems to be developing soundly in Japan. However, all parties are very critical of General MacArthur's activities, and the Soviet Union is particularly critical. At the meeting of the Control Council for Japan, the Soviet representative said that Japan's old politicians have not disappeared, and the Soviet Union alone expressed dissatisfaction with this election.

### The Japan of the Past Year: Remnants of Aggression Eager to Stage a Comeback; Allied Nations Should Immediately Strengthen Vigilance

— Jia Nan

At 7:00 PM on August 14, 1945, President Truman officially announced Japan's surrender at the White House, thus ending the devastating Second World War. The world rejoiced, especially the Chinese people, who had suffered from Japanese aggression for eight long years. Their hearts were filled with mixed emotions of grief and joy, the depth of which could not be described in words.

Regarding the terms of Japan's surrender, they were clearly stated in the Potsdam Declaration. Briefly, they included the following points: (1) The authorities and other forces that deceived the Japanese people and misguided them onto the path of world conquest must be permanently eliminated, and militarism must be eradicated. (2) Allied forces must occupy Japan until practical proof is established regarding the establishment of this new order and the destruction of Japan's war-making power. (3) The provisions of the Cairo Declaration must be implemented. (4) The Allies have no intention of enslaving the Japanese nation or destroying the Japanese people, but all war criminals must be severely punished. The Japanese government must foster democratic tendencies among the Japanese people and remove all obstacles hindering such tendencies... Japan must unconditionally accept these terms without any alteration.

Today, a full year has passed since Japan's surrender. To what extent have the terms of the Potsdam Declaration been implemented? What kind of situation does Japan's political landscape present? Which direction is Japan heading? Is it possible for the aggressions of militarists to make a comeback? I believe these are issues that the Chinese people are very concerned about.

Now, let us provide a brief overview of the political developments in Japan over the past year since its surrender.

Disarmament of Japanese Forces

The first task that the Allied nations should undertake after Japan's surrender was, of course, the disarmament of Japanese forces in various locations. Generally speaking, this task has progressed quite smoothly. Most of the military personnel and civilians abroad have also been repatriated, allowing them to engage in peaceful work. However, whether the militaristic ideology deeply ingrained in the minds of the Japanese people has been completely eliminated remains a major question. It is said that secret military organizations are still quite active within Japan. For example, the plot to assassinate General MacArthur before Labor Day, the recent abuse and murder of Taiwanese compatriots by Japanese police, and the secret activities of Japanese women in Taiwan all demonstrate that the Japanese government and people may appear obedient on the surface, but harbor different intentions in their hearts. The Allied authorities, especially the Chinese government and people, must pay close attention to this! As for the severe punishment of Japanese war criminals, it has not been carried out thoroughly enough. Although the main war criminals have been tried in international tribunals, the secondary ones are still at large, even holding important positions in government and civilian organizations. Although General MacArthur has issued approximately three thousand directives in the past year, many of which are related to purging official corruption, the Japanese government always outwardly complies but secretly resists, engaging in perfunctory and irresponsible actions. In particular, the Japanese zaibatsu (financial cliques), who bear a great responsibility for the war, still control the real power of the Japanese economy. The Japanese government even proposes subsidizing their wartime losses, which is truly a fanciful idea. From this, one can also see the true attitude of the Japanese government. Of course, it is like seeking fish on a tree to expect the Japanese people, who have been influenced and poisoned by the militarist ideology of war lords for nearly a century, to change overnight. However, whether they can fundamentally change and embark on the path of democracy in the future, especially whether enlightened individuals can gain a leading position, is something that deserves our close attention.

The Issue of the Emperor's Continued Existence

Secondly, the issue of the Emperor's continued existence has also caused a great uproar both inside and outside Japan. Some countries among the Allies advocated abolishing the Emperor, with Australia and New Zealand listing him as the number one war criminal. However, other countries believed that this issue should be decided by the Japanese people themselves, without the Allies overstepping their authority. As for the opinions of various political parties and the public in Japan regarding this issue, the conservative Progressive Party and Liberal Party naturally advocated maintaining the Emperor system. Although the Socialist Party agreed to limit the Emperor's great power, it did not advocate completely overthrowing this system. The Communist Party was the most vehemently opposed to the Emperor, but after seeing the fact that the Japanese people did have a blind faith in the Emperor, it also recognized that a violent policy was not the "only method" to overthrow the Emperor system. Therefore, it advocated separating the overthrow of the Emperor from the abolition of the imperial line, and said that the latter could be decided by public opinion. As for the opinions of the Japanese public, the Japan Public Opinion Research Institute conducted a survey in early February of this year, soliciting views from all sides. Among the 2,400 responses received, only 15% advocated "maintaining the Emperor's current status." 45.5% advocated placing the Emperor outside the political arena, as the patriarch of the nation and the center of morality, and maintaining him. 45.9% advocated conditionally restricting the imperial system and reducing the Emperor's power. 9.9% absolutely opposed the Emperor system.

Therefore, according to the current situation, although the imperial system is a product of feudalism and has had a close relationship with the aggressive policies of the former Japanese warlords, it is probably impossible to completely abolish it at this time. In fact, the focus of the issue is not whether the Emperor exists or not, but whether the Japanese people want to use the preservation of the Emperor as a way to maintain the foundation of Japanese aggressive ideology, and stage a comeback after the occupying forces withdraw. We should be vigilant about this possibility at all times.

Draft Constitution of Japan

According to Japan's recently drafted constitution, the Emperor system is still preserved, but all the Emperor's ruling powers have been abolished. The parliament is the highest organ of the state, and it particularly emphasizes that sovereignty belongs to the Japanese people. From the text, this draft constitution seems to be very respectable and has the democratic style of Anglo-American countries. However, based on general experience, especially the habits of the Japanese people, saying nice things is one thing, but whether actions are consistent with words is another. Therefore, instead of focusing on the draft constitution of Japan, we should pay more attention to what kind of cabinet will implement this constitution.

The several cabinets since Japan's surrender have been unsatisfactory. The Higashikuni cabinet was extremely weak and incompetent, and many of its members were responsible for the war, including Konoe, who initiated the war of aggression against China. Therefore, it collapsed after only about a month. Succeeding Higashikuni was the Shidehara cabinet, whose main figures were Shidehara himself and Foreign Minister Yoshida. Shidehara and Yoshida were previously regarded as democrats, but in reality, this was not the case at all. In the past, they opposed the warlords to some extent, but not because they were demanding democracy, but because of the power struggles within the ruling class. The Shidehara cabinet greatly hyped up the parliamentary elections held in April of this year, believing it to be an important step for Japan to move towards democracy. At the time, some people believed that holding elections in Japan at this time could not represent the true intentions of the public, because the Japanese people had not yet reached true awakening. As a result, conservative parties could take this opportunity to exploit it. However, the elections were held as scheduled. In the number of seats, the Liberal Party won 139 seats, the Progressive Party won 93 seats, the Socialist Party won 92 seats, independent candidates won 83 seats, various small parties won 38 seats, the Cooperative Party won 14 seats, and the Communist Party won 5 seats. Judging from the number of seats, the conservative parties had a great advantage. Furthermore, the Liberal and Progressive Parties, which won the most seats in this election, are the embodiment of the Seiyukai and the Minseito, respectively. These two major parties have been alternately playing the leading role on the Japanese political stage for nearly a century, and they should bear great responsibility for this war. However, in the postwar Japanese politics, they still hold an extremely important position. How can this method of putting old wine in new bottles allow Japanese politics to embark on the right track of democracy? How can a democratic constitution be implemented?

Japanese Political Party Activities

After the general election results were announced, the Shidehara cabinet should have stepped down long ago, allowing Ichiro Hatoyama, the leader of the Liberal Party, to form a cabinet. Hatoyama is a thorough opportunist who previously made pro-Axis remarks. After the war, he used democracy as his banner, but was eventually dismissed by General MacArthur. For a time, the Japanese political situation fell into a state of impasse. Seeing this situation, Shidehara believed that there was an opportunity to take advantage of it. On the one hand, he used his illegal power to refuse to recommend the leader of the Socialist Party to serve as prime minister. On the other hand, he himself took the position of leader of the Progressive Party and secretly contacted Yoshida, instigating him to take the position of leader of the Liberal Party, advocating the merger of the Liberal and Progressive Parties, with Yoshida as the prime minister. He himself still pulled the strings behind the scenes, directing everything, and ensuring the strength of the conservative elements. The twists and turns of the cabinet formation process at that time fully revealed the painstaking efforts of the conservative elements. It was truly a pathetic and quite tense scene! As of now, Yoshida is still the Prime Minister of Japan. On the surface, he tries his best to listen to General MacArthur, so many Americans believe that the Japanese have already embarked on the path of democracy. However, the Chinese, who have suffered greatly at the hands of the Japanese, dare not lightly believe their superficial behavior, especially after understanding the ins and outs of the Japanese political situation. Even more so, they must be extremely vigilant.

On August 14, 1945, amidst the Allied forces' preparations to invade the Japanese mainland, President Truman suddenly announced to the world that the Japanese government had accepted the terms of the Potsdam Agreement. The Second World War was thus declared over.

However, the formal surrender ceremony was not held until September 2, 1945, when representatives of the defeated enemy nation signed the surrender document on the American battleship USS Missouri.

This war had been going on for more than eight years since Japan's attack on China. From the American side, Japan's surrender ended a war that had lasted for about three years and nine months. The American-Japanese war began on December 7, 1941, the day the Japanese army attacked Pearl Harbor.

After the Pearl Harbor incident, Japan established the so-called "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere", and its work of plundering land was quite successful. The Japanese army swept through the Philippine Islands, Indonesia, Malaya, Burma, the Pacific Islands, and most of Chinese territory. At the height of the Japanese military's power, the area occupied by the Japanese army reached four million square miles, with a population of 550 million. However, it should be pointed out that the people in some areas continued to resist the invaders, engaging in open guerrilla warfare from time to time, or using more passive methods such as sabotage and non-cooperation.

As the army increasingly expanded its occupied areas, the United States began to unleash its industrial potential. Peacetime production work was changed to wartime factories, and huge new aircraft factories and shipyards were successively established. Millions of men and women were mobilized, not only joining the armed forces, but also joining the powerful agricultural and industrial production front.

By the summer of 1945, the Allied forces were not far from Tokyo. At that time, the Philippines had been liberated and had become a major strategic area for advancing into the Japanese mainland. Iwo Jima and Okinawa had been captured. The Third and Fifth Fleets patrolled the Pacific and Chinese seas, and could sail close to the Japanese coast at any time to bomb its strategic strongholds. The Japanese fleet had been severely damaged. Due to the activities of American submarines and aircraft, the Japanese merchant fleet had encountered a terrible fate. The super-fortresses taking off from the Mariana Islands had systematically destroyed Japan's largest industrial areas.

On July 26, 1945, President Truman and British Prime Minister Churchill signed the Potsdam Agreement, which was immediately sent to Chinese Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and approved by Chairman Chiang. Later, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan and also agreed to the agreement.

The Potsdam Agreement required Japan to accept the following conditions: Japanese leaders who misled and instigated the people to engage in war should be immediately removed. The Allies would occupy Japan. Japan's territorial sovereignty would be limited to the Japanese mainland islands. The Japanese army should liberate all territories. Unconditional surrender. Acceptance of legal sanctions for severely punishing war criminals.

Then August arrived, and the final blows that forced Japan to surrender followed one after another. On August 6, the first atomic bomb exploded in Hiroshima. Two days later, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan. On August 9, the second atomic bomb bombed Nagasaki.

On August 10, after a meeting of Japanese senior officials, Japan's Domei News Agency announced the original text of the Japanese government's memorandum to the Swiss government, saying that Japan was prepared to accept the terms of the Potsdam Declaration, but with the understanding that the Potsdam Declaration did not require the deprivation of the Japanese Emperor's sovereignty.

On August 12, the Allied governments replied that the Emperor should be subject to the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces.

On August 14, the Japanese Domei News Agency released the news that the Allied forces had approved the Japanese government's surrender. The next day, the Emperor read the edict, declaring his decision to surrender to the Japanese people. On August 19, representatives of the Japanese government flew to Manila to discuss the issue of the Allied occupation of Japan with General MacArthur's representatives. On August 22, General MacArthur, then the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, announced the timetable for the Allied occupation of Japan, which was subsequently implemented as scheduled. General MacArthur himself flew to Japan with the first batch of Allied forces to be stationed in Japan, landing at Atsugi Airfield near Tokyo. Japan then formally surrendered unconditionally on September 2. In the legendary two thousand years of Japanese history, this day left it with its first defeat. The world's attention was focused on the battleship Missouri, where the surrender ceremony was held.

After signing, General MacArthur said to the Japanese: "I, in my capacity as Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, hereby declare that I represent the Allied nations' firm determination to supervise Japan's implementation of the surrender terms. I will fulfill my duties with fairness and firmness to ensure that the terms of Japan's surrender are implemented one by one."

The Japanese representative announced the abandonment of the following territories: China, Taiwan, Vietnam above latitude 16 to be handed over to China; "Manchuria", Korea north of latitude 38, and Sakhalin Island to be controlled by the Soviet Far East Army; Andaman Islands, Nicobar Islands, Burma, Thailand, Malaya, Borneo, Dutch East Indies, New Guinea, Bismarck Archipelago, Solomon Islands, and Vietnam south of latitude 16 to be controlled by the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Southeast Asia; Japanese-mandated islands, Ryukyu Islands, Ogasawara Islands, and other Pacific Islands to be controlled by the Commander of the US Pacific Fleet; all islands belonging to Japan, Korea south of latitude 38, and the Philippines to be controlled by the Commander of the US Army.

The dream of Japan sweeping through the Pacific region was thus awakened, and the Japanese Empire also came to an end. Its mainland was also under Allied occupation. This occupation was intended to teach the Japanese people the ways of democracy and peace, so that they would abandon the militarism that led to the war. Japan finally defeated and surrendered unconditionally.

Short Story

### September Clothing (Part 1)

— A Layman

(1)

A yellow leaf flutters down from the treetop, and the wind and rain gradually increase.

After a minor illness, I walked onto the street for the first time, and everything seemed new to me. The most vibrant colors were veiled in a light mist, appearing dull. Young women no longer wore pale green or light red silk, but instead favored gray-blue fashions to create a softer visual harmony.

Unconsciously, I looked down at my own clothes. Although they were neither torn nor old, they were undeniably out of style. Watching others constantly adjusting their new garments, I suddenly felt the urge to have an autumn outfit made for myself. I began to assess my financial situation, knowing that it would be impossible to free up the necessary funds within a month. But if I waited another month, the fashion-conscious city dwellers would likely be putting away their autumn attire and donning warm early winter outfits.

An invisible force urged me to hurry home. I ran all the way to the bedroom, where my wife was habitually lying on the bed fully clothed, greeting me with a smile. I sat on the edge of the bed, taking her hand. She suddenly laughed freely, a laugh like an adult giving to a child, containing both teasing and disdain. She often laughed at me that way. In her eyes, I was like a child, ignorant and constantly in need of a woman's assistance and encouragement.

"Please don't laugh like that anymore, okay?" I almost pleaded. But her laughter did not stop. She said,

"Even though you think you know a lot, your heart is always reflected in my eyes. You must be thinking about getting a new outfit now."

It was strange; she always knew what I was thinking without me having to say it. I said,

"It's good that you know. I really want to, but I don't have enough money right now!"

"Ask me!" she said coquettishly. "I'll give it to you as a reward!"

"No, I won't ask you. I'll find a way myself."

"Don't be so stubborn, child (Heavens! Child again). You should understand that if you didn't spend all your money on books and entertainment..."

"In five days," I stood up and said, "I will present you with two new outfits."

I may have said that, but I had no confidence whatsoever. A ridiculous sense of pride compelled me to make that promise.

"That sounds nice," she said, smiling casually. "But you never seem to keep any of the promises you make."

My face turned red. Like a child, I grabbed her arm. She laughed and said,

"Alright, you're resorting to your last trick. Aren't you ashamed?"

I couldn't say a word. For some reason, I blushed easily in front of my wife, even though she was two years younger than me. I often looked to her for ultimate comfort, so I felt respect and dependence towards her in addition to love.

"There's nothing more to say. I advise you not to be stubborn. There's nothing shameful about asking your wife for money."

"No, definitely not!" I said resolutely. "Five days from now!"

The fallen leaves in the courtyard only increased, and the sun was nowhere to be seen each day.

And so, one day, two days, three days, finally four days passed. I had not found the money. In fact, I never really "planned" properly, because I never borrowed money, nor did I have the ability to speculate or deceive. I could only sit and wait for money to fall from the sky. But it seemed that nothing ever fell from the sky except bombs and such. Then I realized that there was no such thing as a free lunch in this world. If you wanted something, you had to pay the price, whether with knowledge or strength, honesty or deceit.

Every evening when we met, we never mentioned the matter, only exchanged heartfelt glances. She still often smiled at my awkwardness, and I, in turn, could only force a smile.

It was the evening of the fifth day, the last day. I slowed my pace as I walked home, feeling a primal fear and unease. I wished I could avoid going home that night, or go home without seeing my wife. But in reality, I had to go back, and I had to see her. So, like a child, I tried to delay the inevitable. I went to visit a friend.

The gentleman happened to be out. The servant said he would be back soon, and told me to wait. So I sat down, turned on the light, and flipped through a few magazines. Autumn days were short, and the sky quickly turned completely dark. I stood up and stretched, just as I heard footsteps. My friend had returned. He was an amiable, overly-kind person, easy to make friends with but quick to break them off. But if you had a long-term, unbroken friendship with him, he would become a friend for life.

"Ah, I've kept you waiting," he said, warmly clasping my hand and putting his other hand on my shoulder, pushing me down onto the sofa.

"Where were you coming from?" I asked.

"Visiting a friend in an antique shop, and looking to see if there were any interesting jade stones. You know, I like playing with these things."

"I've heard about it," I said, smiling. "Did you find any good antiques today?"

He smiled, lit a cigar, and habitually reached up to touch the scar on his forehead. Then he leaned back deeply into the sofa, exhaled a puff of smoke, and said,

"I never believe in antiques. I just buy whatever I like."

"You must have quite a collection of those things?"

"Quite a few. I'll show you later when we go upstairs," he loved to mention this, his face lighting up with excitement, making the scar on his forehead even more prominent. "But today I got another good thing. Take a look."

He carefully took it out of his pocket. I took it and saw it was a jade bangle, with vibrant colors. It looked very valuable. It seemed like my wife also had one that was similar to this one. They would make a good pair together. I thought about buying it to give to my wife, to make her happy. I said,

"How much did you pay?"

"Five taels," he said casually. "They gave it to me at cost, as thanks for helping them make a sale they'd been working on for two or three years."

I was surprised that a plain jade bangle was worth so much.

"My wife also has one that's about the same."

"Then take this one back and give it to your wife, and just make it a pair. Consider it a preemptive baby shower gift."

"No need," I said. "You bought it because you liked it. How can I ask you to part with it? Or else, I'll buy it from you."

"Sell? I never sell things," his eyes widened, the scar seeming to swallow people up. He stood up angrily. I quickly said,

"Don't misunderstand. It's because I can't accept such a valuable gift from you for free, so I said I'd buy it. If you insist on refusing, then it doesn't matter. We can talk about it later. Fortunately, although life is short, there are still many opportunities to settle debts of gratitude, love, and hatred!"

He laughed happily. Then the bangle was stuffed into my pocket, easily considered mine, and would later be my wife's. She could now complete a pair, and she would be so happy that she would fall into my arms, repaying me with her adorable smile.

I cheerfully said goodbye to this kind friend.

I walked down the road excitedly. I had an excuse now! Look, I originally had money to make clothes, but I bought you a bangle instead. Then she would admire and thank me, and it wouldn't be as shameful to take her money to make clothes.

At this time, every street lamp smiled at me, everyone was amiable, the whole world was warm and gentle, and the autumn evening breeze was delightful. I accidentally bumped into someone, and I quickly apologized (normally I might have gotten angry). The person also asked me with a similar gentle attitude. At this moment, it was hard to believe that there was any strife or quarreling in the world. Understanding and peace pervaded between people, love ruled the universe, and I vowed to never be cynical again.

An ordinary gift could move a person this much, but why were people, including myself, so stingy?

(3)

I pushed the door open and entered. My wife was still lying on the bed fully clothed, smiling at me slightly as usual. I was about to speak, but I froze. Look, there were two brand new outfits neatly folded on the bed, dark blue and dark gray, my usual favorite colors and materials. I stood there speechless. My wife got up from the bed, walked over, took my hands, and, revealing the most adorable smile in the world, said,

"Although it's not the highest quality, I hope you'll accept it, seeing as it comes from the sincerity of my heart." (To be continued)

### Riverside Fisherman (Selected World Famous Paintings)

— By Alphonse Legros (1837-1911)

Collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum, London

Alphonse Legros was originally French, but later naturalized as a British citizen.

Legros was born in Dijon. His father was an accountant. He often went to the countryside to visit relatives; the farmers and landscapes he saw became the subject matter of many of his later works.

He first received artistic education at a school in Dijon, and later studied with a painter. In 1851, he went to Paris to study painting with the landscape painter Camille Corot. In 1857, his portrait of his father was exhibited in the Paris Salon.

In 1863, he went to England; the following year, he married an English woman and supported himself through etching and teaching. He taught copper engraving at the South Kensington Art School, and later taught at the university for seventeen years, influencing many students. Therefore, Legros was not only an excellent painter but also a good professor. —Attached note by Cheng Lu

### Past Traces

— Yang Mou

I wander the streets.

The neon lights still proudly flaunt themselves, and the bustling crowds still laugh as much as ever. -- I remember, I once melted my life into the torrent of happy people who forgot the years, but now, the crowds are still the same, and I stumble along to unearth the traces of history.

My life is still so short, these wounds are still so fresh, and an active heart hates loneliness so much. However, the devil chuckles in the dark corners, and I eventually chew on the bitter juices of the heart.

Forget bravely, I once thought.

But the first seeds sown are the hardest to pull out. What's more, the seeds have already sprouted, with beautiful flowers that make you nostalgic and appreciative, and with stinging thorns. If you want to pull them out, you must first pay the price.

Today, only today, can mankind dominate.

The time of the past is like clouds flying in the sky, water flowing in the river. What reason to find its tracks, time never flows back, past traces are always past traces, only adding a sense of loss, evoking some nameless sorrow.

A beautiful heart can create a beautiful world.

Thinking about the world that is reminiscent of old feelings and old scenes seems to be completely isolated from the new and beautiful reality.

Wandering the streets. Tomorrow, the day after tomorrow... —35, 7, 31

### Musical Musings

— Hongyin

Music is the most unrealistic art. People who play music are often able to ignore the practical interests and "benefits" of reality, especially those who do music education. If everything starts from "benefits" and "successes and failures", I advise such people to do business or be politicians, not to do art!

### An Inch of Territory, an Inch of Blood 2

— Ye Jingfeng

There was also a time (not within the 38,900+ minor battles) that in S City in the occupied zone, an intelligence station was discovered by a traitor. One night, an agent was working when he was captured by the Japanese military police.

After many tortures, this brave fighter stood firm, without saying a word.

Finally, the Japanese military police made a small hole in his rib seam, put a surgical clamp into the hole, clamped out a piece of his lung, and cut it off. He immediately fainted. Hot blood gurgled out of the hole, soaking his shirt and pants. The ground was covered in a pool of blood. The Japanese military police used surgery to stop the bleeding and stitched up the seam. He woke up, saw the pool of blood on the ground, smiled coldly, and still didn't say a word.

Perhaps he thought that this pool of bright red blood was his glory, and that it was a symbol of the final victory.

In addition, there is an even more ordinary scene. Compared with the many tragic events in the War of Resistance, this is indeed an ordinary scene.

A small village that had just been invaded by the enemy was burned, killed, looted, and raped. As the enemy prepared to build fortifications, preparing to hold it for a long time, a small team of guerrillas rushed over to deal with this group of bandits.

The one who automatically served as a guide was an old farmer from the village. A wave of grief and indignation accumulated in his heart—the ancestral nine-room house was burned to the ground; his wife, daughter-in-law, and daughter were imprisoned by the bandits in the village chief's house, and their fates were unknown; his son was wounded by a bayonet and had to serve as a porter for the enemy.

He couldn't shoot a gun. He only held a carrying pole with pointed ends. Past midnight, he led the small team of guerrillas to attack. As soon as the gunfire started, the fire also broke out. The guerrillas carried out annihilation and pursuit in a methodical manner.

When the work was completed and the team returned, it was dawn, but the guide was nowhere to be seen. Asked the old, young, and female villagers who remained, but no one knew. After searching for a long time, they found him lying at the base of the courtyard wall of the village chief's house, his eyes not closed, his teeth still clenched, and yet there seemed to be a hint of a smile. His only weapon, the carrying pole, also lay beside him, with some blood stains on the pointed ends. But there were two large wounds on his legs and chest; blood was still flowing continuously, seeping from his body into the soil.

In the twenty-two major battles, one thousand one hundred and seventeen important battles, and thirty-eight thousand nine hundred and thirty-one minor battles, there are many tragic stories of bloodshed. In addition to these major battles, important battles, and minor battles, there were also those heroic guerrillas, those death-defying special forces fighting with the enemy, and countless selfless and nameless heroes who performed countless tragic stories of bloodshed.

Although the atomic bomb shortened the war by a year and a half, if you knew how depleted the Japanese national power had become, how strong the morale of our Chinese soldiers had become, and how fully and completely prepared the total counterattack of our country and the Allied nations was, perhaps you would rather that those atomic bombs be born a year and a half later.

"An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth." Although the ancient dogmatic retaliation is harmful to the harmony of nature, I believe that it is still easier to settle this huge blood debt with the enemy, clearly and precisely. It has been almost a year since the victory, and under the scrutiny of the public, they have completely evaded it. If things go wrong, they may even bite us back, as if to say that we are such an incompetent country that we still remain a major stumbling block to world civilization and progress unless we are controlled by foreign powers.

Martyred national heroes! I hope that this pen can redraw a clear outline of all the bloody stains since the War of Resistance…!

### Congratulations

— Shaofu

The Shanghai Municipal Council was officially established yesterday. We are delighted by the establishment of this organ of public opinion, which will lay the foundation for true democracy, step onto the stage of constitutional implementation, and seek welfare for our 4.5 million citizens. We would also like to congratulate our representatives on their health.

Those who study the history of parliaments often praise the British Parliament. In fact, the spirit of Parliament is also very simple: everyone knows what they know, and says everything they can. In the parliamentary seat, you can be stern and serious, you can pound the table and scold, and you can mercilessly attack the other party until they are completely defeated, but there is one principle: loyalty to the country (despite differences in political views). Outside of Parliament, everyone is still good friends, and there is no slightest impact on personal friendships.

The situation in the US House of Representatives is similar.

It is precisely because there is such a watchful and unforgiving organ of public opinion that fully fulfills its responsibilities and supervises the government that British and American leaders have to be extra cautious in their administration. On the other hand, all measures are supported by a strong people.

In fact, very few British and American leaders are not from Parliament. Disraeli, the last Prime Minister of the Victorian Dynasty, fought in Parliament for more than thirty years.

In the past, people scolded others, and in the future, they will be scolded by others. Whether scolding or being scolded, one must cultivate a morality of scolding and a magnanimity of scolding. Progress can only be made in the midst of scolding.

Scolding people requires knowledge and cultivation. The Parliament does not tolerate malicious attacks and nagging. Those who are scolded must also have knowledge and cultivation, otherwise they will either be speechless and at a loss, or they will get angry and jump up and down.

Shanghai's natural status is important, and there are indeed too many problems. With this organ of public opinion, the opinions of our 4.5 million citizens can have a chance to be vented. We support the Municipal Council, and we also support our representatives to speak for us, complain, and even scold. The more tense and enthusiastic, the more we applaud, because we know that the effect of scolding is improvement. It is progress. And progress will bring us benefits.

### Who Will Go to the Moon?

— Gui Ting

The first person to fly to the moon will probably be a woman around thirty years old.

She will fly to the moon on the tip of a super rocket. Her physique may be twice as tolerant of super-speed impact force as a man's. This is just a tentative prediction, because recently, experiments on rats, rabbits, and cats have found that females are always more physically tolerant than males. If women's physique is roughly the same as animals, then the above prediction should not be wrong.

Professor Britton and his assistants at the University of Virginia School of Medicine conducted this experiment by placing these animals in a special centrifuge and rotating them for two minutes at speeds up to 120 revolutions per minute. This speed is equal to 25 times the impact force of normal gravitational acceleration.

This experiment is to prepare for the near future when we can reach a speed of one thousand miles per hour and the direction of flight changes very quickly and drastically. Before the war, the effect of G-force on higher animals was never noticed. Later, the problem of G-force was discovered because of the study of the pain felt by dive bomber pilots when they suddenly flew upwards after diving. According to average reports, they can usually withstand about six G's of force, but may withstand a maximum of ten G's of force for the shortest time. This can be considered the maximum limit that humans can withstand.

Dr. Britton's experiment found that those animals were still able to survive after being subjected to 25 G's of centrifugal force for two minutes. Although there were no apparent injuries afterwards, they always died after several hours for some unknown reason. Dr. Britton pointed out that speed has no harmful effect on the physiology of animals. Living things on Earth are constantly moving at a speed of about 500,000 miles per hour. That number is based on the Earth's rotation speed, the solar system's movement, and the galaxy's rotation, but they themselves have no feeling whatsoever.

We only feel uncomfortable when the speed suddenly changes, such as when the elevator suddenly stops or when the car suddenly drives off. This is the result of the sudden change in the center of gravity affecting our body tissues and blood circulation.

The experiment also found that fully mature animals were more tolerant of the effects of centrifugal force than younger ones, and females were much stronger than males.

They rotated thirty-six male rats at a speed of 120 revolutions per minute, or 25 G's of force, for two minutes, and they died within a few minutes after stopping. Twenty-four female rats were subjected to the same experiment, and only two died. The center of gravity of the female animal's body seems to be different from that of the male, but the amount of displacement may be comparable.

According to speculation, humans may be more tolerant of this type of experiment than lower animals, because they have been walking upright for millions of years and have long been accustomed to adapting to the displacement of body weight. At the same time, we also believe that women are physically superior to men, just like female cats are to male cats. This may foreshadow that in the next war, most of the drivers will be women.

Dr. Britton and his assistants also discovered that animals can gradually adapt to high G-forces over a considerable period of time. At first, eighteen pairs of rats were rotated at a slight speed, and then the speed was gradually increased every day. When it was increased to 25 G's of force, half of them were still able to survive, otherwise almost all of them would die.

Their hearts were apparently affected by the centrifugal force, causing them to eject more blood to all the organs of the body. At first, the heart rate gradually increased, but later slowed down due to fatigue. The breathing rate also gradually increased. The strangest thing is that the brain waves of the animals also underwent significant changes during the rotation experiment.

The animals were killed one by one after the experiment and subjected to autopsy. Small parts of bleeding were found in the various organs of the body, but this damage was almost insignificant. However, the cause of death still could not be determined. It was probably due to the violent shock to the entire physiological system.

According to Dr. Britton's calculations, a person, especially a woman, may be able to withstand four to six G's of force for about ten minutes without dying. This experiment is very difficult to conduct. Because the person being tested will easily lose consciousness, once the experiment begins, there is no way to control any reaction to stop its progress. Even if it reaches a dangerous level, it cannot be controlled. Therefore, it is still in the animal testing stage.

However, it seems that the moon will mostly be destined to be a new realm under the rule of women in the future!

### Young People: Go to the Sky!

— Zhang Rongzhi

The annual Air Force Day has arrived again! Recalling that time when the Chinese Air Force made a stunning debut, there is indeed unlimited inspiration!

The Japanese invaders thought that the Chinese Air Force was weak! and could be bullied! On August 14th, they sent the most elite Kisarazu and Kanoya air squadrons, with great fanfare; not at all tentatively, into the skies over Shanghai, preparing for a major trampling. Who knew! They were unlucky enough to run into my young Chinese Air Force, which, with a spirit of great fearlessness, annihilated these two most elite air squadrons of the enemy.

The Air Force today has become the main force in combat. The surrender of the Japanese invaders! Although due to two scientific atomic bombs, it was also because the Japanese invaders lost air supremacy.

Since the Air Force has become a condition for survival, commemorating Air Force Day should focus on building a strong Air Force!

Chairman said in "China's Destiny": "Everyone must aspire to be a pilot." Therefore, young people with ambition, quickly join the Air Force. Patriotic men, become flying generals!

Today, celebrating Air Force Day, the people of the country should have a deep understanding. So that China can build a majestic air force with the ability to attack and defend in the next few years!

At the same time, we should thank our international friends for their various assistance during the war! And General Chennault's "Hump" transport team and the famous Flying Tigers are even harder to forget! The Soviet volunteer air force shed blood for China in the early stages of the war of resistance! This is also deserving of gratitude! Finally, I would like to pay my respects to our Air Force martyrs!

Young people, go to the sky!

### The Death of Yan Haiwen, a Chinese Air Force Warrior

— You Xuan

On August 14, the second day after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in the 26th year of the Republic of China, the Chinese Air Force, which had not been around for long, resolutely launched an attack to defend the motherland, posing a great threat to the enemy.

On the morning of the 17th, a Chinese bomber circled and soared over the Shanghai-Songjiang area, dropping bombs on the open formation. The enemy retaliated with intense anti-aircraft fire, causing the warplane to fall into countless exploding shells. Unfortunately, the tail of the plane was hit and it fell down, emitting smoke. The warriors in the plane had no choice but to parachute.

There was a commotion in the enemy's camp, and many enemy soldiers began to circle around the landing site. The young air force warrior held a pistol in his hand and stood fearlessly on a high ground.

The encirclement was shrinking, and an enemy soldier wanted to approach and force him to surrender. With a "snap," he answered the enemy's insulting gesture with a bullet. At this time, the enemy had no choice but to temporarily disperse, and then used greater and more forces and weapons to rush up.

The encirclement was further shrinking, and the two sides were only fifty meters apart. The warrior resisted alone, with only one bullet left. He looked around, and all around were enemies. So he looked at the sky, smiled, and then stood at attention on the motherland's battlefield, raised his gun, and committed suicide for his country.

He was Yan Haiwen, an air force martyr, who wrote an indelible page in the history of the Chinese Air Force.

An American sailor, Hall, only eighteen years old, married a woman of thirty-eight. The picture shows the couple's honeymoon passion.

### Key Money and Tips Exist in Name Only

— Zhong Xian

According to reports, the Municipal Council passed the regulations on the management of house rentals, stipulating that the Shanghai Municipal House Rental Management Committee may inspect vacant houses, and those suitable for living may be rented out within a limited time, and there are also regulations on collecting rent: In addition to collecting rent, the lessor shall not collect key money and tips in any name. This news can be said to be good news for those who have no house to live in, but in order to achieve the purpose of this house rental rule and solve the housing shortage, I believe that it still needs the assistance of all parties and the careful work of the management committee.

Everyone knows that the current housing shortage in Shanghai is not without human causes. In fact, there is not a shortage of houses. What is lacking are connections. Just open the classified advertisements in the daily newspapers, and there are many houses vacant in the rental and key money sections. If you don't believe me, look at the advertisement wording, such as "surplus houses for rent" and "vacant houses for key money." Think about it, aren't surplus houses and vacant houses houses that no one lives in? As for the types of houses, you can have whatever you want, such as garden houses, apartments, Shikumen entire, three-story buildings, entire floors, side rooms, pavilions, parlors, etc. In short, there are houses, as long as you have the intention and the power. So I think to inspect vacant houses suitable for living, just take the classified advertisements in the newspaper and go to the address!

Let's talk about the regulations on collecting rent! It is also clearly published in the rental and key money advertisements in the newspaper. Now I will copy a few recent advertisements from the newspaper word for word, without avoiding the suspicion of doing free advertising: "2 million (storefront) with business equipment for rent, monthly rent 100,000, ×× Road × Alley × Number" "×× Road ×× Road double-room one-story house, new paint, move-in fee 28 bars" "Cheap, urgent transfer of 2.5 million exquisite vacant room, one, ×× Road ×× Alley ×× Villa ×× Number." Smart people should understand what the price in the above advertisements is. So I think to find out whether key money and tips are being collected, just look at these facts!

Finally, I have to state: I am not doing it as an informant to get 30% of the bonus. I am just trying to assist the House Rental Management Committee and offer a few opinions.

### The Inside Story of a Taoist Ritual

— Mao Zihou

Recently, there have been many articles in the newspapers criticizing Taoist rituals. Taking a comprehensive view, they all say: "Taoist rituals drive away ghosts, waste money and manpower. Some Shanghai people are too backward in their thinking..." and suggest methods such as "introspection" and "not donating money" as good ways to eliminate "Taoist rituals." No one has thought about analyzing this issue and proposing a good way to eliminate this unreasonable phenomenon!

Originally, most people who oppose "Taoist rituals" believe that the motivation for holding Taoist rituals is due to the "superstition" of some citizens. Therefore, they all put forward negative calls, but no positive suggestions. In today's Shanghai, are Taoist rituals to drive away ghosts really due to the superstition of some citizens? The author can say responsibly: "No"! That is caused by a small number of local ruffians taking the opportunity to make money. Just use power to arrest the organizers of the Taoist ritual one by one and charge them with "fraud." You will definitely be able to achieve the goal of no one following up. If it is a matter of religious faith, people will inevitably follow one after another, sacrificing themselves to this "superstition." Facts will soon automatically prove whether "Taoist rituals" are really "superstition" or "profiteering."

Citizens who are slightly familiar with the inside story of Shanghai society must know that there are many "mountain-sitting" hooligans in Shanghai who collude with gatekeepers to make a Taoist ritual business in July every year, which can earn half a year's worth of expenses. This is an absolutely true fact. Those who handle the business appear in the form of "doing public welfare," supplemented by the evil power of "local snakes," collecting donations from house to house, forcing you to refuse. The fact that the accounts are not audited is the key to the collusion of the "Taoist ritual" leaders. Under the promotion of the clamoring of ignorant women, the psychological desire for blessings of the elderly, and the fear of trouble of ordinary people, few people dare to come forward to publicize and prevent Taoist rituals, which is why they are held every year without interruption.

From a legal point of view, "donation" is a kind of "gift." If it is not attached with conditions, the donor has no right to interfere with the disposal of the gift. However, this kind of "gift," if it is issued with forced requirements (for example, assigning quotas and designating the amount of donations), is tantamount to extortion. In an extortion setting, using deceitful means to take possession of a portion of the object of the extortion - money - is in accordance with the fraud provisions of the criminal law.

Therefore, I call on society: do not be superstitious about "Taoist rituals." Donate the money to "emergency hospitals." Some so-called: "scratching an itch through a boot." Because most of the citizens who pay for Taoist rituals are unwilling to do so. Therefore, the reason why they must pay money to donate to Taoist rituals to drive away ghosts is that they are forced by "evil forces"!

The most active way should be to call on the municipal government: Please use your power to resolutely eliminate the strange phenomenon of holding peace rituals in July! Do not let foreigners photograph the strange appearance of "Taoist rituals" and send them to overseas newspapers for publication, saying: "This is the most common good method used by Shanghai citizens in the 'epidemic prevention' of 1946." Fortunately! (Move the payment to help doctors who died from the epidemic)
