### Zhou Enlai and Others Arrive in Beijing Yesterday; Representatives from Various Parties Hold Two Rounds of Talks; Decision Made to Continue Exchanging Views Today

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 21st] The peace talks, which had been suspended for a long time in the capital, received good news from the sky today. Political figures and greeters at the airport were exceptionally busy. Under the bright autumn sun, everyone was smiling, as if celebrating a happy occasion. Representatives of the Communist Party, the Youth Party, the Democratic League, and social leaders in Shanghai returned to Beijing together this morning by China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) planes and US military special planes from Shanghai. The Chairman appointed Wu Tiecheng, Wang Shijie, Sun Ke, Shao Lizi, and Secretary-General of the Political Consultative Conference Lei Zhen to welcome the CNAC plane. When the door opened at 10:10 AM, Wu Tiecheng and Wang Shijie were the first to step forward to welcome them. Luo Longji was the first to disembark, followed by Li Weihan, and then the other representatives came down one after another. They included Youth Party representatives Zeng Qi, Zuo Shunsheng, Chen Qitian, Li Huang, Yu Jiaju, Yang Yongjun, and Secretary Liu Pengjiu; Democratic League representatives Zhang Junmai, Shen Junru, Huang Yanpei, Luo Longji, Zhang Bojun, Jiang Yuntian, and Secretary Xu Chuanlin; and social leaders Hu Lin and Guo Moruo. There were 19 people in total from the Communist Party, including Li Weihan and Chen Jiakang. Wu shook hands with each of the arrivals and conveyed the Chairman's greetings. All of them showed happy expressions. After disembarking, reporters asked them to express their feelings about arriving in Beijing. Their answers were mostly the same, that is, "very happy." Hu Lin said, "I am here to see them off," because Hu planned to return to Shanghai by train that evening. Li Huang said: The flight was smooth and we arrived safely in Beijing, which symbolizes the bright future of the negotiations. Guo Moruo said: I hope peace can be achieved. Luo Longji said: Today's solemn scene is the result of the Shanghai negotiations. This unofficial meeting will proceed smoothly, and then a ceasefire can be achieved, because today should be the day when Chinese people solve Chinese problems. Chen Jiakang said that the Chinese Communist Party is willing to follow various parties, social leaders, and the Chinese people to make contributions to justice and strive for democracy and peace. Shen Junru said that the third party came to Beijing this time, hoping to solve the problem satisfactorily, but this work is very difficult.

The crowd stopped for two minutes amidst the hustle and bustle, and the atmosphere was very harmonious. They then followed Wu Tiecheng, Wang Shijie, and Lei Zhen into cars to the National Council Hall for a rest.

The reporter then went to Dajiaochang Airport to welcome Zhou Enlai. Zhou's special plane landed at 10:40 AM. Zhou was the first to disembark and thanked Sun Ke and Shao Lizi who came to welcome him. Then he shook hands with Sun and took pictures. Reporters scrambled for this good shot. Zhou was wearing a light gray suit with a smile on his face. The reporter asked him to make a statement, but he declined. He then went with Sun and Shao to the National Council Hall. Shao's office became a grand gathering of influential figures. The reporter Luo Fu used a "divide and conquer" approach, asking everyone to express their opinions. Amidst the busyness, there was a feeling of celebrating a happy occasion.

At 11:00 AM, all the representatives went to the National Government to meet Chairman Chiang. The Chairman was fully dressed in military uniform, ready to depart. Seeing everyone, he expressed infinite joy and asked Zhou Enlai, "What are your opinions?" Zhou replied, "According to the Political Consultative Conference's resolution, we all agree." The Chairman then informed them of his trip to Taiwan. He also said, "I originally planned to go two days ago, but I stayed for two days because you were coming. It is very good that you have come today. In future discussions, President Sun will preside. I hope it can start immediately and be completed quickly." After a quarter of an hour, the representatives said goodbye and returned to their residences. At 12:30 PM, they attended a banquet hosted by the government representatives at the International United Society. After lunch, they held an informal exchange of views, which lasted until 3:00 PM. During the meeting, Sun Ke delivered a speech first. Then Zhou Enlai, Liang Shuming, Huang Yanpei, Luo Longji, Zhang Junmai, and Li Huang all put forward their opinions.

After 3:00 PM, the third party held a meeting at the Bank of Communications to exchange views; at 5:30 PM, they held an informal meeting at Sun Ke's residence. Those present included Chen Qitian, Zeng Qi, Li Huang, and Zuo Shunsheng of the Youth Party; Luo Longji and Huang Yanpei, Zhang Junmai of the Democratic League; Wu Tiecheng, Chen Bulei, Zhang Lisheng, Shao Lizi, Wang Shijie, Sun Ke, and Lei Zhen on the government side; and social leaders Mo Dehui and Hu Lin. The meeting ended at 8:15 PM.

It is reported that the discussion today was still a broad exchange of views, and the eight opinions put forward by the government were explained and studied. No concrete results were obtained, and the meeting will continue on the 22nd. The procedure for peace negotiations was also mentioned.

Li Huang, Zuo Shunsheng, and Hu Lin returned to Shanghai by night train at 11:00 PM. It is heard that Li and Zuo will return to Beijing by night train on the 22nd. Before leaving, Li told reporters about the meeting on the 21st: Even if we have great difficulties at present, we will work hard to achieve our goals. There is no need to exaggerate some pessimistic remarks. In short, in today's exciting atmosphere, I hope we can achieve something.

Liang Shuming told reporters that the current situation is still very dangerous. It seems commendable that the Communist Party representatives came here, but it may be the first step for them to return to Yan'an. Their determination to sacrifice is greater than their desire for compromise. There are crises in the negotiations. We still hope to endure them and must have a guarantee of peace. Although Marshall represents friendly nations to seek peace for us, his power is limited, and his work is also passive. We believe that the third party must unite and form a guarantee of peace autonomously, "with the Chinese as the main force and the Americans as the auxiliary force." Using this force to deal with this problem is what we think is a fair opinion. We must adopt it, otherwise, we will pursue the responsibility of those who do not. We also hope to give the third party an opportunity to participate in military affairs, not to participate in the military three-person meeting, but to exchange opinions outside the meeting as a bridge to promote the success of the three-person meeting.

The activities on the 22nd were: the social leaders hosted a banquet for representatives from various parties at noon and held an on-site meeting to discuss everything. In the afternoon, the three parties visited the Communist Party, and at 7:30 PM, they continued to talk at Sun Ke's residence.

### Ten Thousand People Audited at the Beijing High Court: Zhou Fohai, a Traitor, Initially Tried, Admits Joining the Puppet Organization Was a Mistake

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] The Capital High Court publicly tried Zhou Fohai for the first time on the 21st. Nearly ten thousand people attended the trial, and the order was extremely poor, setting a new record in the history of trying traitors in the capital. At 6:00 AM, attendees arrived in droves, and both inside and outside the Dacheng Hall was packed. The reporter seats and the government leader seats were all occupied. Court President Zhao Chen signed the writ of extraction at 7:40 AM. At 8:30 AM, the traitor Zhou was escorted to the High Court's holding room. At this time, the gates of the Dacheng Hall were tightly closed, and the crowd outside the hall became even more congested. Despite the efforts of Chief Commander Ge Zhaotang, the magistrate, to persuade them, it was to no avail. It was delayed until 9:50 AM when Court President Zhao Chen, accompanied by Associate Justices Jin Shiqiao and Jin Shiyu, along with Prosecutor Chen Sheng and Chief Clerk Luo Cuiru, ascended the court amidst the chaos. It took considerable effort from the police to carve out a small path through the crowd to escort the traitor Zhou into the court. The traitor Zhou was wearing a gray cloth long gown, blue-gray trousers, gray socks, and black round-toe leather shoes. He wore frameless glasses with hexagonal lenses. Witnessing the surging crowd, he appeared extremely embarrassed, and his face changed abruptly. While climbing the stone steps of the main hall, he trembled noticeably. After ascending the court and standing at the defendant's stand, his mouth twitched from time to time. With trembling hands, he fidgeted with three volumes of a ten-line notebook, using it to support himself on the desk. Then, he wiped his sweat with a handkerchief and glanced at his defense lawyers, Zhang Shijian, Wang Shanxiang, and Yang Jialin. After the presiding judge shouted, "Maintain order," the trial began.

In court, he was first questioned about his name, age, birthplace, Beijing address, and occupation. Amid the noisy chaos, the traitor Zhou shouted, "Zhou Fohai, fifty years old, from Yuanling, Hunan, residing at 8 Xiliuwan, Nanjing." Then, the prosecutor read the indictment, accusing him of participating in traitorous negotiations with the Japanese puppets and of the crime of betraying the country and fawning upon the enemy. Regarding his so-called surrender, it was merely empty talk, as he had already been openly wanted by the Supreme Court Prosecutor's Office as early as November 4, 1939. Therefore, even if it were true, it could not be established, and the request for leniency was presumptuous. The charges were specially aggravated on these two points. The presiding judge then inquired about his family property. According to his statement, his family consisted of his wife, Yang Shuhui, his son, Shao Hai, aged twenty-eight, a graduate of the Chengdu Military Academy; daughters, Shuhai and Huihai; and sister, Fozhen. As for real estate, he only had the residence at 8 Xiliuwan in Nanjing, with fifteen or sixteen rooms. In Shanghai, there was a residence at 262 Hunan Road, with seven or eight rooms, and six rental houses on Yuyuan Road and other locations. For other movable properties, please refer to the investigation report of the Military Intelligence Bureau.

### Describing the Course of Defection: Putting the Blame on Others, Justifying Himself in a Ridiculous Manner

After further questioning about his background and the positions he held before the war, the court asked, "Were you ever a minister in the National Government?" He replied, "No." The court asked, "Did you want to be?" He replied, "Of course I wanted to, but I didn't expect it, and I couldn't be. However, a government minister is specially appointed, while a party minister is elected, so it's even bigger." Asked, "Did you ever attend the Central Political Conference?" He replied, "I was an observer." Asked, "Then you must have known the country's policy of resistance against Japan and participated in the formulation of the regulations for punishing traitors. Why did you still become a traitor?" The traitor Zhou was speechless. After a moment, he began to elaborate on his traitorous philosophy, saying, "At that time, leaving Chongqing to join the puppet regime was a different political view. Now I realize it was a mistake, and I don't dare deny legal responsibility. But at that time, the international environment was unfavorable, the war situation was not good, and I had no confidence in the resistance. I believed that peace might be a way to save the country. Furthermore, I didn't want to advocate peace in the rear and affect the resistance, so I decided to sacrifice myself and advocate peace in the occupied areas. After arriving in Nanjing, I realized my behavior was wrong and actively tried to surrender and show loyalty to the central government." The traitor Zhou also emphasized that during his tenure as acting minister of the Central Publicity Department, he never made any remarks detrimental to the resistance. The presiding judge rebuked him, saying, "So you were outwardly resisting Japan but inwardly 'at peace'?" The traitor Zhou stammered for a while before saying, "Peace has no outward appearance." Regarding the "Low-Key Club," the traitor Zhou said, "It was just a joke by Mr. Hu Shih, and there was no organization. I had no contact with the traitor Wang in Nanjing, only learned from Gao Zongwu that Wang also advocated peace in a low-key manner." Afterward, he went on and on about his defection, briefly stating that "negotiations with the Japanese, Imai and Kagesa, were done by Mei Siping and Gao Zongwu, and he did not participate. Wang Jingwei talked to him about the peace conditions, which included good neighborly friendship, recognition of 'Manchukuo,' and joint anti-communism. He thought that these were not conditions for national subjugation and could be considered, but there were three prerequisites: (1) approval by the Japanese cabinet, (2) approval by the Japanese Imperial Council, and (3) announcement to the world. The Japanese agreed to all of them. The traitor Wang was very firm, and the traitor Mei was even more so. He was uncertain, so he followed them." He also cunningly claimed, "Now I deeply regret leaving Chongqing and should be punished. But in Nanjing for five years, it was a history of struggle. If I am convicted because of it, it would be difficult for me to accept." The traitor Zhou continued to confess about the various measures of the puppet government and his personal actions. Regarding the convening of the puppet Sixth National Congress, he blamed it on the reorganization faction led by Lin Baisheng and others. Regarding the puppet government's declaration to return to the capital, which negated all laws and organizations of the National Government in Chongqing, he blamed it on Wang Zhaoming's sole decision. As for his continued clinging to the puppet government after realizing his mistake, he cunningly claimed that he wanted to "actively perform meritorious service." Regarding the organization of the puppet government, he cunningly claimed that it was a reenactment of the two splits of the Ning-Han and Beijing-Tianjin factions. As for signing contracts with the Japanese, he described it as an agreement with "children." He also denied ever interfering in the affairs of the puppet military commission, participating in the Clear Villages Committee meetings, presiding over the work of poisoning the youth, and co-signing the declaration of war against Britain and the United States. After the court confronted him with the facts and his traitorous remarks, Zhou Fohai repeatedly said, "I know my guilt!" "I regret it!" He also said, "I cannot shirk responsibility for my actions. Deep down, I was indeed doing it for my country. It can be said that I was 'colluding with the enemy to seek relief for my country!'" The court retorted, "What is 'colluding with the enemy' if not opposing your own country? If this is allowed, it is sufficient evidence of your collusion with the enemy and betrayal of the country, and there is no room for argument." Zhou Fohai then silently said, "I definitely don't want to deny it."

### Showing Off His "Merits" in an Ugly Manner: Claiming Issuing Puppet Currency Was to Resist Japanese Military Scrip; Said That Self-Surrender Was to Show Heart

The traitor Zhou then continued to describe the situation of the puppet Ministry of Finance and the Central Reserve Bank in great detail. According to him, the reserves of the Central Reserve Bank consisted of 50,231 bars of gold (ten taels per bar), US$5.5 million, over 7.639 million taels of silver, 330,000 silver dollars, 9.23 million Japanese yen, 200 million Japanese government bonds, over 52 million yuan in Shanghai bills of exchange, and other stocks, movable properties, and immovable properties. The amount of Central Reserve Bank notes issued was 41 trillion yuan. All files on various properties had been transferred to the Bank of China last year. Zhou boasted extensively about his "struggle" in issuing puppet currency to resist military scrip and confront the Japanese, and vehemently argued, "Did the central government not want the 8 million people in the occupied areas? Issuing currency, setting prices, and maintaining people's livelihoods is definitely not a crime!" Regarding the issue of surrender, Zhou Fohai confessed that after he appointed Cheng Keqiang and Peng Suxiang in 1941, Cheng and Peng were arrested by Li Shiqun. After he rescued them, he learned that they were personnel of the Military Intelligence Bureau. He asked them to leave Shanghai for Chongqing in October 1942 to liaise with the central government. The two returned to Shanghai in 1943, carrying a letter written by the late Director Dai Yunong, informing him that Chairman Chiang had approved his surrender, and he began work. The letter had been destroyed. One sentence in it could be said in a secret court. He also said that Commander-in-Chief He had acknowledged his surrender when he accepted the surrender in Nanjing last year. The traitor Zhou also made a boastful statement, saying, "I don't want to reduce my sentence by surrendering, I just want to show my heart. In terms of law, whether it's beheading or shooting!" He also said, "On September 30 last year, I telegraphed the Chairman to ask if I should go to Chongqing. The Chairman telegraphed back to tell me to go. I went immediately, saying it could be an arrest or a voluntary surrender." At this point, Zhou Fohai's defense lawyer, Wang Shanxiang, stood up and presented a volume of sixteen favorable pieces of evidence collected by the three defense lawyers according to law, and asked the court to rule on them, and hoped to acknowledge his achievements in colluding with the Military Intelligence Bureau to carry out counter-espionage work, fully summon witnesses, review files, and Gu Qian, the former commander of the Third War Area, also replied in a letter that he would allow the files to be reviewed and witnesses to be summoned, and asked for detailed investigation. Then, witnesses Zhou, (person in charge of the Military Intelligence Bureau sent to Nanjing for counter-espionage work), Zhang Shuping (Zi Xing, former liaison representative of the Third War Area stationed in Shanghai), and Yang Siyi (former senior staff officer of the General Headquarters of the Su-Zhe-Wan Border Area Guerrilla Army) were summoned in turn, all proving that Zhou Fohai had assisted in the counter-espionage work in great detail, and an investigation showed that Zhou Fohai had sent a letter to Niu Fuzhang and replied to Zhang Shijian. The presiding judge ordered Zhang and Yang to submit written proofs to the court within two days. At this point, Zhou Fohai looked happy and shouted, "Please make a ruling, from 1942 onwards, I was 'colluding with the enemy to plot against the enemy country'." At this time, it was 1:20 PM. After the clerk stood up and read the minutes, the court announced, "This hearing is still in the nature of an investigation. Today cannot be concluded. The trial will be rescheduled, and the defendant will be remanded." The court adjourned at 2:00 PM. Attendees left with the traitor Zhou, and the Dacheng Hall was left with broken tables and chairs, and a mess of dirt. The emptiness and desolation of the hall, compared with the chaos and noise a few minutes earlier, were in stark contrast, truly like a battlefield after a disaster.

### Public Works Bureau Transportation Office: Public Trial of the Embezzlement Case; Bureau Director and Section Chiefs All Claimed Ignorance

[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 21st] The embezzlement case of the Public Works Bureau Transportation Office, which was uncovered by the investigation team in Tianjin, was publicly tried by the Tianjin District Court for the first time on the 20th, lasting all day. Those involved in the case included the Director of the Public Works Bureau, Wang Xijun, the Director of the Transportation Office, Yao Zhenyu, the Chief of the General Affairs Section, Zhang Xiaochun, and the Chief of the Warehouse Section, Zhu Shuan, and twelve others. Wang Xijun claimed ignorance of the embezzlement and sale of received materials. Zhang Xiaochun repeatedly quibbled about the fake accounts, fake receipts, stamps, and other evidence found in his office desk, but his loopholes were numerous, causing laughter in the audience from time to time. The judge asked about his false reimbursement, saying, "The actual expenditure was over 2 million, why did you report over 7 million?" He confessed, "That was a plan I wrote when I was idle!" Asked, "Are the receipts fake?" He confessed, "Not all of them are fake." Yao Zhenyu and other criminals also tried to shirk responsibility. The court adjourned in the evening and will be rescheduled.

### "Accepting" Enemy Property Should Be Called "Recovering": Liu Jiwen's Return to Nanjing

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] Liu Jiwen, Deputy Minister of the Audit Department, recently returned to Nanjing after going to North China and Northeast China to audit the list of economic construction and property received. According to Liu, many factories in the north were dismantled and plundered after repeated riots after the Japanese surrender, making restoration difficult. He had different opinions on the word "receiving" for the reception of enemy property, believing that it should be called "recovering" rather than "receiving," because since the September 18 Incident, the Japanese occupied the Northeast, seized materials and raw materials locally, and exploited the labor of our compatriots with low wages. They also used names such as conscription, requisition, and requisition to enslave our people to engage in production. They looted and moved materials produced with our land, materials, people, and labor to Japan, and it is unknown how many. Therefore, everything produced by using our country's land, materials, people, and labor is actually owned by our country. Therefore, the factories, mines, and properties received after the recovery of the Northeast are actually "recovering" our inherent properties. As for how to recover the materials that were moved away for more than ten years, it is also worth studying.

### Jiangxi Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs: Corruption Case Reported; Xun Court Believes Evidence Is Insufficient

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 20th] Qian Ping, Director of the Jiangxi Office of the Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs in the Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi area, was previously reported by the third team of the investigation team, believing that he was suspected of corruption, and was transferred to the Jiujiang District Court Prosecutor's Office for investigation. After reviewing the relevant files, it was believed that the evidence of corruption listed by the investigation team was still insufficient, and a decision was made not to prosecute. At the same time, it was stated that the issue of the office's refusal to accept the steam engine left by the Japanese in Jiujiang, as pointed out by the investigation team, was a matter of administrative punishment and could not be used as evidence of a crime.

### Difficulties in UNRRA Transportation Gradually Reduced; Goods in Warehouses Being Cleared; Huo Baoshu Inspected Warehouses Yesterday and Went to Beijing on Official Business Today

[Local News] Director Huo Baoshu of UNRRA Headquarters told the Central News Agency reporter yesterday that the difficulties in UNRRA transportation have gradually decreased, and most of the relief supplies stored in various warehouses are being cleared. He personally inspected the various wharf warehouses one by one yesterday, and several warehouses have been cleared. There are currently 110,000 to 120,000 tons of goods stored in the warehouses, most of which are heavy machinery and cannot be transported out for the time being. If UNRRA supplies are not expedited to China, the supplies that UNRRA plans to transport out next month may be interrupted. This shows that UNRRA's transportation capacity is increasing day by day, and there is no problem in clearing the supplies. The reporter asked about UNRRA's current financial situation. Huo replied that UNRRA's funds are raised from various sources. The 430 billion yuan allocated by the Executive Yuan is a relief fund, which is different from expenses. It has been received and used by some of the institutions responsible for relief work under UNRRA. As for the funds obtained from suspected sales of goods, the amount is very small and does not provide much assistance. He is currently planning the source of UNRRA's funds and will have a detailed plan in two or three weeks. Regarding the personnel changes after the change of the Director of UNRRA Headquarters, Huo believed that there would be no changes. The previous rumors that Deputy Director Li Zhuomin would leave his job were not true, and the personnel of other departments also remained in their positions.

(Also reported) Huo is scheduled to go to Beijing on official business today and return to Shanghai tomorrow.

### Red Cross Emblem Physicians and Merchants May Not Abuse; Red Cross Presents Petition to Executive Yuan for Suppression

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] The Red Cross emblem is the property of the Red Cross Society worldwide. Except for the military medical institutions and personnel that can use the special symbol of the white background with the red cross as stipulated in the 1929 International Red Cross Convention and recognized and permitted by the Taiguo government, other individuals or groups may not falsely use it for commercial or other purposes. Since the Anti-Japanese War, non-statutory health institutions, practicing physicians, and merchants in various places in our country have widely used the white background with the red cross symbol, which is detrimental to international reputation. The General Association of the Chinese Red Cross Society has recently presented a petition to the Executive Yuan for approval to issue a notice to all provincial and municipal governments across the country, and requested the Ministry of Health to notify all provincial and municipal health bureaus to severely suppress it.

### Tainan Madou Wendan Plans to Increase Production; Estimated to Plant 100,000 Trees

[Central News Agency, Tainan, 21st] The Wendan produced in Madou Town, Zengwen District, Tainan County, is famous far and wide. According to a field investigation by reporters, this kind of fruit tree is not planted in a planned manner, nor is it operated by the government. It is one of the side businesses of local farmers, and it is planted casually in gardens. This tree blooms in early spring every year and is harvested in mid-August. There are currently 30,000 Wendan trees in the Zengwen District, and Madou Town has 20,000 trees, with better soil quality. The annual output is about 800,000 branches. Last year, due to the impact of the typhoon, only 30% of this year's harvest was obtained. This year, there was another severe typhoon disaster, and tree branches were broken, so next year's output will be even less, and the planned production figures will not be reached. According to Ding Mingnan, the head of the Zengwen District, the district plans to plant Wendan extensively on 300 acres of open space in Madou in the future, with an estimated 100,000 trees to be planted, and plans to allocate a budget of one million Taiwan dollars in the next year, specifically for purchasing fertilizers and encouraging farmers to produce. If the plan is successful, the production of Wendan in Madou will increase greatly.

### Review of Taiwan's Governance

Taiwan's retrocession has swiftly passed a year. Recently, journalist delegations from Beijing and Shanghai returned from Taiwan, bringing faithful reports about the island. Chairman Chiang also flew to Taiwan yesterday for an inspection. Taiwan's governance should be a matter of concern for all parties. Taiwan had been under enemy occupation for nearly fifty years, during which the people of Taiwan had fully tasted the bitterness of Japanese military rule. Now that the land has been restored, the entire nation has expressed boundless excitement over Taiwan's return to the embrace of the motherland. On the government's side, our leader, despite being burdened with myriad daily affairs, flew south for inspection, demonstrating how much our Chairman cares about the governance of Taiwan and the Taiwanese people. In our nation's history, Taiwan had a brilliant past. In the late Ming dynasty, Koxinga used Taiwan as a base to resist foreign invasion, a heroic and tragic act that set a good example for our nation, preserving our national integrity. From the late Qing dynasty to recent times, the Taiwanese people's loyalty to the nation has been able to uphold Koxinga's legacy and continue to demonstrate it in various ways. In terms of national consciousness, the Taiwanese people can be said to be particularly strong. Now that they have returned to their homeland, the feelings of the Taiwanese people are as excited as our welcoming of the return of our Taiwanese brothers, and we feel the same way.

We should especially cherish this kind of emotional exchange, as it is this emotional exchange that solidifies the entire nation into an unbreakable whole. Now that the Taiwanese people have returned, what they hope for from the motherland may be very urgent, and the reconstruction of national governance in Taiwan may not be able to fully meet the ideals of the Taiwanese people. If such a state exists, it is understandable. Taiwan's retrocession has been just over a year, and in terms of governance, it may not have fully met everyone's expectations. We need patience. The government should, in the course of implementing national policies, respect the wishes of the Taiwanese people. We must not lose the hearts of the Taiwanese people. Now that Taiwan has returned to the embrace of the motherland, under the supreme guiding principle of the Three Principles of the People for our nation-building, Taiwan should become an ideal experimental area for the construction of the Three Principles of the People.

Speaking of Taiwan's current political system, the reason why it is different from the provinces of the mainland is that it is a transitional measure adapted to the times and local conditions. In principle, we oppose the specialization of local politics, and the laws and regulations generally applicable to all provinces should also be applicable to Taiwan. However, at least for now, we cannot but recognize the specialization of Taiwan's governance as a wise decision. Taiwan has been under Japanese rule for a long time, and the Japanese have actively promoted assimilation policies, so today's Taiwan does not seem to have completely eradicated the evils of past Japanese military rule. During this transitional period, Taiwan's specialization seems necessary. This specialization is manifested in the establishment of the administrative chief system and the special issuance of currency outside the legal tender system. All these measures are originally intended to seek the welfare of the Taiwanese people. The temporary suspension of legal tender in Taiwan and the becoming of the Taiwan dollar as currency were originally intended to prevent the evils of domestic currency expansion from affecting Taiwan, so that Taiwan's monetary and financial system could tend to be stable. However, according to Huang Chao-chin, Speaker of the Taiwan Provincial Assembly, "Taiwan's finances are more stable than in the mainland, but in the eyes of Taiwanese compatriots, it is worse than during the Japanese occupation, and the economy is more painful because of currency inflation and rising prices." Since these words came from the speaker of the assembly representing public opinion, they are presumably not without reason. Therefore, we want to call the attention of the Taiwan authorities here. We know that under the control of the Taiwan authorities, even if the number of Taiwan dollars issued is slightly increased, it does not seem to cause malignant currency expansion, but since there is a tendency for prices to rise, this decline should be stopped as soon as possible.

Looking from the present to the future, since Taiwan should become an ideal experimental area for the construction of the Three Principles of the People, we cannot ignore some points that should be paid attention to in Taiwan's governance in the future. Taiwan was under Japanese rule for fifty years. In the past fifty years, all governance in Taiwan was centered on and based on Japan itself. Now that the land has been restored, we must not let this legacy be inherited. In the future, Taiwan's governance should be based on, centered on, and started from China. Based on this principle, we should improve the status of the Taiwanese people in culture, politics, and even economics. In terms of culture, the number of Taiwanese compatriots who received higher education in the past was not large. We should improve the cultural and educational level of Taiwanese compatriots in the future. Among them, what should be especially focused on is that we must integrate the cultural thoughts of the Taiwanese people with those of the mainland compatriots in the shortest possible time. In the past fifty years, under the enslavement and rule of Japanese warlords, the Taiwanese compatriots should eliminate narrow regional concepts, restore self-esteem and self-confidence, and join hands with compatriots across the country to move towards the road of nation-building in order to achieve the national rejuvenation of our country.

Regarding the development and utilization of Taiwan's resources, it already had a considerable scale during the period of Japanese warlord rule; however, we should note that Taiwan's economic development in the past was entirely centered on Japan and entirely focused on the needs of Japan's national defense. Today, Taiwan is left with oil factories and aluminum industries operated by the Japanese, but Taiwan itself does not have huge reserves and production of aluminum and oil. In terms of agriculture, Taiwan has mostly mountainous terrain and is not suitable for sugarcane production. For the needs of Japan itself, Taiwanese farmers were forced to give up the economically advantageous production of food and engage in sugarcane production. It may have been necessary in Japan, but we must not let this situation continue. Taiwan's economic development should be moved to appropriate locations in our mainland. At the same time, some industries that are economically advantageous in Taiwan should be supported for their development. For example, Taiwan's camphor industry originally accounted for 80% of the world's production, but now, due to the invention of substitutes, the need for camphor in the international market is not as great as before. How to enable this unique industry in Taiwan to have sound development and how to coordinate Taiwan's economic construction with the economic construction of the entire nation is a topic worthy of research and planning.

Furthermore, Taiwan's public land accounts for 70% of Taiwan's total land area. This is an ideal area for implementing the Three Principles of the People's land policy. Since the percentage of public land is so high, the ideal of "land to the tiller" and the Three Principles of the People's land policy can be fully realized. We consider Taiwan to be an ideal experimental area for the construction of the Three Principles of the People because Taiwan has all the necessary conditions. We hope that Taiwan, which has returned to the embrace of the motherland, can give the whole country a demonstration effect. Those who come later may surpass those who came before, and one day, the rest of the country may have to learn a lot from Taiwan. We firmly believe that the Taiwanese compatriots, who are close brothers, will definitely be happy to support the completion of this lofty mission. We extend our warm hands to our Taiwanese compatriots, wishing to join hands and move forward together on the road of nation-building from now on. The rejuvenation of the nation, perhaps it will be realized.

### Labor Unrest Occurs in Hangzhou Silk Factories. Weicheng Factory Initiates, Forcibly Halting Work at Other Factories. Resumption of Work Preceded by Mediation by Relevant Authorities.

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 21st] Today, labor at Hangzhou's various silk factories requested reduced hours and increased wages, leading to labor unrest. Initially, on the 18th, a worker surnamed Yu at the Weicheng Silk Factory forcibly shut down the machines at 5 PM, rendering it impossible for everyone to work. On the 19th, Yu (a director of the labor union) did not come to work at the factory all day. The workers in the factory spontaneously halted work for two days at 4:50 PM, resulting in the loss of one hour's worth of silk cocoons that had already been boiled. On the 20th, the majority of workers at the Weicheng Factory went on strike. When various relevant authorities in Hangzhou intervened, the labor demanded increased wages, but the factory's management indicated they needed the consent of the capital, and no resolution was reached. Today, approximately two to three hundred workers from the Weicheng Factory compelled the cocoon sorting workshop, which had not joined the strike, to halt work, and damaged equipment in the workshop. They then rushed out and went to various factories across the city, forcibly halting work. At the Tianzhang Silk Factory, glass windows were broken and machinery was damaged. By 3 PM, with mediation from the Social Affairs Section and other relevant authorities, work was resumed. At 4 PM, the Social Affairs Section of the Municipal Government convened labor and capital for mediation. Ambassador Stuart took a picture at the Hangzhou office of this newspaper. The upper picture was taken in front of the gate, the lower picture was taken on the lawn (photographed by Huang Xingtian of this newspaper).

### Bandit Suppression Completed in Yangcheng Area; Remaining Scattered Bandits Being Cleaned Up, Ring Leaders Being Pursued.

[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 21st] Paratroop Commander and concurrently Commanding Officer of Bandit Suppression in the Yangcheng Area, Major General Ma Shigong, recently returned to Suzhou after transferring from Beijing to Shanghai. On the afternoon of the 21st, at approximately 5 PM, he, along with Chief of Staff Colonel Liu Nongnuan, met with this newspaper's special correspondent stationed in Suzhou. He issued a comprehensive statement on the progress of bandit suppression work in the Yangcheng area over the past ten days. A brief record follows: At the beginning of the bandit suppression work in the Yangcheng area, command headquarters were established in the east and west districts of Kunshan and Yu counties, so that responsibility could be divided at each level. After ten days of combined suppression and pacification, considerable results have been achieved. In the south, the bandit leader Li Defu was executed, and most of his subordinates have surrendered. Only a few are scattered, and they can no longer form groups. The two bandit groups of Liu Genbao and Liu Gengui, formerly of the "New Fourth Army," who had roamed in the northern part of Taicang, have now been completely eliminated. However, the bandit leader Liu brothers managed to escape and are currently being pursued. The bandit suppression mission in the Kunshan area can be said to be 80% complete since the collapse of the three bandit groups of Li and Liu. As for the Yu area, the "New Fourth Army" led by Ren Tianshi, formerly based in Meili, and the bandit group led by Zhao Jianping, of the pseudo-Suzhou-Wuxi Border Region County Government, who had roamed in the Huangdai and Dangkou areas at the junction of Suzhou and Wuxi, have all been cleared. The two bandit leaders, Ren Tianshi and Zhao Jianping, barely escaped with their lives and are said to have fled alone to the Yinshan Mountains in Nantong County. The command headquarters has strictly ordered their capture to prevent future troubles. Therefore, the bandit suppression mission in the Yu area can be said to have been completely successful. Regarding the handling of bandits who have surrendered or been arrested, there are more than 600 people in the east and west districts. The government is generous and does not blame the past. Except for a few who have committed heinous crimes and bear blood debts in the area, who should be punished according to the law, the rest are handed over to the cadre training institutes in various counties for education and reform, so that they may still have the opportunity to start anew and serve the country. Mr. Ma also stated firmly that he has decided to inspect Changshu, Jiangyin, Kunshan, Taicang, Jiading, and Baoshan, starting on the 23rd, to inspect the current status of the troops and to promote the completion of the bandit suppression work by the end of October. However, he believes that the completion of bandit suppression is not simply measured by the absence of bandits in the jurisdiction. It should be ensured that bandits have nowhere to flee, either surrendering or being eliminated. Therefore, the completion of bandit suppression in the Yangcheng area depends on whether this principle can be achieved.

### Wuxi County Magistrate and Speaker Secretly Accused of Corruption and Malfeasance.

[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 21st] The Civil Affairs Department of Jiangsu Province recently received a secret accusation that the current Wuxi County Magistrate Xu Yuanruo and the Speaker of the Provisional Assembly Jiang Puzhai were involved in corruption and malfeasance, including a major case involving human life. An order was sent to the Second Administrative Supervisory District to thoroughly investigate, and the investigation report has now been submitted for review and handling. In addition, the Jiangsu Supervision Office has also ordered the Second District Office to thoroughly investigate the case of corruption and perversion of justice by the former Wuxi County Magistrate Fan Tizheng, and the District Office has also completed the investigation and submitted its report.

[Guangzhou News] In recent months, many county-level popular organs have accused county magistrates of malfeasance. Mr. Li Yangjing, Director of the Provincial Civil Affairs Department, publicly reported this at the Provincial Assembly and stated that if any administrative personnel under his jurisdiction are found to be guilty of illegal malfeasance, they will be severely punished if there is solid evidence. Over the past year, the county magistrates who have been detained for investigation after being accused include Xia Xiufeng of Hepu County and Wang Yixin of Haikang County. Those who have been dismissed from their posts and investigated include Luo Qiqing of Chixi County, Tan Zhichao of Gaoyao County, Luo Xiexun of Huiyang County, Lin Yisheng of Chenghai County, Chen Shu of Yangchun County, and Huang Junmin of Nanhai County. Thirteen people have been dismissed, and eleven have been investigated and exempted from punishment. Currently, the county magistrates who have been accused by the public include those in Nan'ao, Fengshun, Pingyuan, and Xuwen, totaling 14 counties, and investigators have been dispatched separately for thorough investigation.

### Zhenjiang Road Repair; Dredging Ditches.

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch] The total length of the trunk and branch roads in the Zhenjiang urban area is 25 kilometers, and the road surface area is 280,000 square meters. Due to disrepair during the enemy occupation, there was hardly a complete road surface after the victory and return. Through the active repair by the construction authorities, there has been rapid progress so far. The renovated or being renovated road surface is 28,600 square meters. Together with the road surface under construction, it accounts for two-thirds of the total area of the main roads in the city. As for the road surface standards, efforts are being made to improve them compared to the pre-war period to meet the needs of modern urbanization. For example, Daxi Road, the prosperous commercial center of the city, is 2 kilometers long, and asphalt pavement is currently being laid. The project started on September 18 and is being carried out simultaneously in two sections. This is the only asphalt road in Zhenjiang and is scheduled to be completed within the year.

All horizontal ditches and cellar wells have also been dredged together. The thorough dredging of all ditches on Daxi Road is still underway, and iron covers are being installed on the cellar wells to prevent sewage from stagnating.

### Suzhou Business Tax; Extended to Rural Areas.

[Our Suzhou Dispatch] Since the establishment of the county tax collection office, a detailed plan has been formulated for the implementation of various tax policies. Director Min Wenwei met with this newspaper's special correspondent stationed in Suzhou to elaborate on the details, which are briefly recorded as follows: (1) Organizational aspect: It is planned to set up branch offices in Fengqiao, Mudu, Huguan, Jiaozhi, Weiting, and Lumu, and tax collection offices in Dongshan and Xishan. (2) Consolidation of the tax system: When the business tax was collected by the direct tax bureau, only the urban area was targeted. Now it is planned to extend it to the rural areas, but efforts will be made to take into account the real environment. For example, stores with strong capital, whether they are sole proprietorships or partnerships, must be handled seriously so that the tax revenue can be abundant and government expenses are not lacking. And for family stores that maintain the minimum living business, there seems to be a need for consideration, so we strive to simplify the procedures, so as to avoid disturbing the people. As for the tax on the use of civilian boats, there are many abuses in between, and it is also a huge disturbance to the people, and it has now been decided to improve it.

The bandits went west towards the west and escaped. Fortunately, the local area was not affected.

### Wuxi Business Community Asks For A Thorough Investigation; Qi Shuyan Power Plant Abuses; And Requests To Stop Collecting Huge Security Deposits

[Our Wujin News] Qi Shuyan Power Plant, large scale, has always been well-known, is one of the famous power plants in the country, but since the victory was taken over, for a year, the plant failed to actively reorganize, to expand, only to maintain the status quo, the important needs of local factories, agricultural water conservancy and other aspects of the use of electricity, often many excuses and restrictions, can not cope, all sides on which the sound of trouble, recently suddenly arbitrarily presented to the Ministry of Economic Affairs to collect security deposits, counted in a few days up to two hundred thousand yuan of huge, aroused outside suspicion, Wuxi business community should express resentment, The South Jiangsu Branch of the National Industrial Association of China and the Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce jointly presented to the Jiangsu Supervisory Commissioner of the Jiang River, requesting a swift rectification to revoke the Qi plant's collection of security deposits, and to send personnel to thoroughly investigate the abuses, which is briefly stated:

Expensive Electricity; Difficult Connection

Check the Qi Shuyan Power Plant issued Announcement No. 17, collecting meter deposits, electricity security deposits and various miscellaneous fees, the electricity lighting users security deposit part, calculated according to the meter capacity, the highest is up to 120,000 yuan, the lowest is 3,000 yuan, the electricity security deposit part of electricity users, one and a half months to two months the highest electricity amount as a principle, the number is huge, the purpose is unknown. Check the Qi plant's daily power generation, in more than 230,000 degrees, monthly total of more than 7 million degrees, meter reading day users more than 5 million degrees, intangible losses and waste unused as more than 2 million degrees, lighting users account for 11%, electricity users account for 89%, Wuxi two places, electricity per degree from 231 yuan to 377 yuan, several times higher than Shanghai, this increase in electricity security deposit, than the original paid security deposit increased more than 30 times, the number reached more than 200,000 yuan of huge, intangible freezing part of the funds of the industry and commerce. According to the Qi plant's supply of electricity to the industry and commerce, often lack of coal, full load and other words, many excuses, and the outside world's leisurely mouth, many according to the charter reported to be connected, so far only to keep the corner, trying to figure out the latter can actually wish, so there are millions of connections to the three-horsepower. In order to seek the truth, the association once sent an electrical letter to the Economic Department with letter number 149 on August 16, ordering the Qi plant. The association sent an electrical letter to the Economic Department with letter number 149 on August 16, ordering the Qi plant to list in detail the motor users who have been supplied and the date of reporting to be connected, so as to remove doubts in the case, but so far the plant has not replied with the double letter, which is enough to prove that the plant's actions are quite unable to block the leisurely mouth.

With Surplus, Near Harassment

And Qi factory police business, not seen a loss, there is a surplus, there is no need to collect this item to hire a large amount of funds. The so-called collection of security deposits of the day, purely to prevent arrears, and Qi plant on the user arrears, there is an immediate cut-off line of strict regulations, since there is no need to collect this security deposit, if it is said that this approach is based on the handling of the Shanghai City, then the Shanghai City lighting electricity, each degree is only 73 yuan, Tin Wu two places users bear, more than two times more, Shanghai City to coal easy electricity power, electricity per degree is only 200 yuan, Wu Tin two places bear nearly two times, in the electricity rate standard is not consistent, how can arbitrarily cited. This time without soliciting local public opinion, only the private opinion of a few people in the plant, please the Ministry of Economic Affairs to approve it, it is not accepted by all users, at this time of industrial and commercial difficulties, the government to help not spare any effort, the measures of public utilities, should be closely related to people's livelihood, the government for transport and telecommunications and other businesses, in order to take into account the people's livelihood difficulties, do not hesitate to subsidize policies, in order to promote price stability, deaf plant in the end is state-owned, or private, although its nature is still unclear, but on the government's established policy, seems not to be contrary to each other, the association and other sent to the subordinate members of the appeal, the power plant to collect security deposits, all feel near hate, increase industrial and commercial burden, ten thousand difficult to admit, this help industry and commerce of the , swift, revoking the main cases, to lighten the burden on users, and to send personnel to thoroughly investigate the above said factory, to maintain law and order and benefit the people, etc.

### Huai River Dyke Restoration Awaits Winter Low Water; Dredgers Enter Huai River to Carry Out Dredging.

[Our Bengbu News] Since the Yellow River flooded eastward this summer, the Huai River dike restoration project has been greatly affected. Currently, the up and down Huai River is surging, and construction is still difficult. According to the person in charge of the Huai River Water Conservancy Project Bureau, the Huai River dike restoration project was originally carried out in sections. Now, due to the autumn floods, the water level rises and falls from time to time, and it will not be possible to officially cultivate it until the low water period in winter. In order to prepare for dredging the riverbed, the Bureau is now assigning technicians to measure the water level and flow along the river to understand the dynamics of the Huai River. Five dredgers, the main tools for dredging the riverbed, have been allocated by the Huai River Guidance Committee and have been gradually driven from Shanghai. They must be transferred to the Zhenjiang Canal via Hongze Lake and then driven into the Huai River to carry out dredging to remove silt. It is also said that Shen Baixian, Deputy Director of the Huai River Guidance Committee, will fly to Huayuankou in the coming days to inspect the Yellow River damming project and limit the completion of the damming work within this year.

### Robberies Occur Frequently Without Security; Wutun Road Passenger Cars Suspend Service.

[Our Wuhu Dispatch, 21st] The Jingwu and Wutun road bus robbery cases have occurred three times in a week. It is estimated that two passenger cars near Dangtu were robbed on the evening of the 12th, with a loss of 8 million yuan. On the 13th, a bus from Tunxi to Wuhu was fired with more than 100 bullets and a grenade by bandits in Linxi, seriously injuring the driver's assistant, and slightly injuring two passengers, stealing more than 10 million yuan. On the 19th, two buses from the Wanshan Relief Branch of the Ministry of Communications from Tunxi to Wuhu were robbed near Helixi, seriously injuring a retired employee of the Electricity Bureau, and all his retirement money was robbed. The driver's assistant was slightly injured. The two cars were robbed of 20 million yuan. The bandits also set fire to the eastern part of the car with rice straw in the field. The Wutun Highway has suspended the Ministry of Communications bus service since the 20th due to lack of security. Wuhu public opinion criticized the Anhui authorities for ignoring public security in the province.

[Our Wuhu Dispatch, 21st] The Zhenxing, a small wheel from Wuwei to Wuhu, was robbed near Yuncang on the 18th, with a loss of 10 million yuan. The bandits shot and injured three oil company clerks, Jingpu.

Our fellow townsmen from eastern Zhejiang, residing in Shanghai, account for the largest proportion of people from other provinces. Before the war of resistance, transportation between Shanghai and Zhejiang was very convenient. To places such as Zhenhai, Yin County, Xiangshan, Fenghua, Cixi, Yuyao, Shanglu, etc., one could take a Shanghai-Ningbo line ferry at four or five in the afternoon and arrive in their respective hometowns the next day. Because Ningbo's transportation facilities were complete at that time, such as the Ningbo-Cao'e section railway train, the long-distance buses on the Yin-Zhen-Ci-Guan-Cao section highway, and the small steamships sailing to various places, it was truly very convenient. Moreover, it was both economical in terms of money and time.

During the enemy-puppet period, after eastern Zhejiang fell into enemy hands, all transportation ports were blockaded by the enemy. Sometimes there might be Shanghai-Ningbo line ferries running, but because Ningbo's transportation facilities were destroyed, passengers going to places like Yuyao and Shangyu had to spend three or four days to get home. Moreover, the trouble of purchasing boat tickets, the strict queueing and luggage inspection when boarding, those who have experienced this will never forget it. If the ferries were not running, then we could only take sailboats, but we had to first go to Caojing

(a coastal area under the jurisdiction of Songjiang County) and then take a sailboat to the coastal areas of eastern Zhejiang. These sailboats were mostly used for carrying goods, so they were extremely dirty, and there were many dangers, with frequent incidents of capsizing and sinking.

Since the victory, all transportation ports have been fully opened, which everyone is very happy about. Although the Shanghai-Ningbo line has regular ferries run by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the scope of passengers included is not broad, mostly Ningbo passengers. Because Ningbo's transportation facilities were destroyed during the war, passengers going to places like Yuyao and Shangyu even have to spend the night in transit. Due to the inconveniences mentioned above, they abandoned the Shanghai-Ningbo line ferries and instead took the Shanghai-Hangzhou railway train to Hangzhou, crossed the Qiantang River, and took the Qiane Highway (Qiantang River to Cao'e) long-distance bus to Cao'e, and then dispersed to their respective destinations. According to the current schedule of the two railway bureaus for the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, the first train to depart is the special express at 6:45 am, arriving in Hangzhou at 11:30 am. After crossing the Qiantang River to the bus station to catch a bus, it is already 1 or 2 pm, and by the time they arrive in Cao'e, it is already past 5 pm. If they then hire a boat on the Cao'e River in Baiguan, or walk thirty or forty li, then it is not feasible. Because the local areas in the countryside are not peaceful, and incidents of robbery and banditry occur from time to time, they must spend the night in Baiguan and only arrive home the next day. This is too uneconomical in terms of money and time, especially for small clerks in our salaried class. For the sake of the above-mentioned hardships, I would like to ask the two railway bureaus to add a Shanghai-Hangzhou line night train (slow train), preferably departing at 12 midnight and arriving in Hangzhou at 6:30 am in the morning. Then our fellow townsmen from Ningbo and Shaoxing can all arrive home on the same day, without having to spend the night in transit. Not only can money be saved, but also a lot of time. I wonder if the authorities of the two railways can do this?

Finalizing Street Names and House Numbers Throughout the City

Since the Japanese puppet era, most of the street names in Shanghai have been changed, and the old iron street signs have been removed, which is very inconvenient for memory. After the victory, our government has renamed the streets again. Except for a few important and well-known roads that have clear signs, many small roads and stone roads in Nanshi, Hongkou, and western Shanghai, especially at the corners of major roads, have no street signs and the house numbers also lack a definite standard, which makes it impossible for citizens to find their way! For example, North Sichuan Road, Qiujiang Road, Xingjiaqiao Road, etc. in Shanghai, these roads are quite famous, but without street signs, everyone still knows them. The house numbers on North Sichuan Road also have two colors, blue and white, which may not be a problem for those who have been in Shanghai for a long time, but it is indeed difficult for fellow countrymen who have just arrived in Shanghai to identify them. I sincerely hope that the municipal authorities will finalize the house numbers throughout the city in the near future, and then put up street signs, so as to facilitate the citizens and provide public convenience.

Reply to Lu Zhaojun: Regarding the appeal for students of Chongqing Normal School, we have received a reply from the Ministry of Education stating: "Upon investigation, the Ministry's Instruction No. 20697 in mid-April of this year stipulates that 'All teachers and students should return to their original hometowns.' Therefore, students of Chongqing Normal School from Sichuan cannot come to Beijing to study. Furthermore, this school is to be handed over to the province for management, and the Sichuan Education Department has been repeatedly instructed by telegram to take over the school and report on the progress as soon as possible. Recently, due to the Sichuan Education Department's delay in taking over the school, emergency measures have been taken and the National Jiangjin Normal School has been instructed by telegram to continue operating the school. By the end of this year, it will accommodate teachers, staff, and students of Sichuan origin from the school, as well as the National Chengda Labor Education Children's Army Girls' Normal School, and students from national normal schools stranded in Chongqing who are returning to their hometowns, and instructions have been issued to comply with this."

### Content of Turkey's Reply to the Soviet Union Announced; Turkey Firmly Rejects Co-Management of the Dardanelles; Agrees to Revise Convention with Three Suggestions; Does Not Acknowledge Responsibility for Wartime Breach of the Convention

[Agence France-Presse, Ankara, 21st] Turkey has firmly rejected the Soviet Union's second request for co-management of the Dardanelles Strait. The content of the reply has now been released, in which Turkey denies the Soviet Union's accusations regarding German ships passing through the Strait during the war, and states that if the Soviet government persists, Turkey will only submit the matter to international arbitration. Turkey hereby makes the following suggestions: (1) Revise the Montreux Convention regarding the passage of ships of various countries through the Strait, (2) Replace all references to the "League of Nations" in the Convention with "United Nations Organization," (3) Remove Japan's name from the list of signatory countries and replace it with the United States.

The note continued that the Turkish government agreed to revise the Convention, but could not acknowledge responsibility for violating it during the war. As for the fourth item in the Soviet note, namely that the Black Sea littoral states should be solely responsible for concluding a new convention, the Turkish government believes that this Soviet claim is inconsistent with international law, because the Black Sea and the Turkish Straits issue cannot be regarded as solely related to the Black Sea littoral states, as expressly stipulated in international law. The Black Sea cannot be considered a closed sea. The Soviet Union's request for co-management of the Strait is difficult to agree to, because this action would not allow Turkey to share sovereignty with a foreign country. What is tolerable if this is not? If the Strait is attacked in the future, the Soviet Union can take the best solution, that is, mix the national defense forces with the United Nations guards and be responsible for stopping the aggression. The Soviet Union disregards Turkish sovereignty and wants to force it to submit. It is not known what its intentions are. If it is said that Turkey's rejection of this request will damage the Soviet Union's prestige, it is also unreasonable. According to the Turkish government's view, Turkey's honor, prestige, and survival are in imminent danger. The Soviet Union accused Turkey of obtaining the consent of certain foreign countries to take various military measures in the Strait. This statement is completely unfounded. In short, Turkey's acceptance to participate in the treaty revision negotiations proves that we have sincerity. This negotiation is already prepared and can be held at any time.

### 解決三途徑　蘇土無單獨談判餘地
### Three Ways to Resolve the Issue; No Room for Separate Negotiations Between the Soviet Union and Turkey

[Agence France-Presse, Ankara, 21st] Turkey's reply to the Soviet Union has a cold tone, and its firm rejection of all Soviet demands is almost certain. There is no room for separate negotiations between the Soviet Union and Turkey. As for the three points suggested by Turkey to revise the Montreux Convention, all are technical issues and of no great importance. Political observers believe that future developments can take three paths: (1) The Strait issue is shelved indefinitely; (2) The Soviet Union withdraws its demands, and at the same time, the international conference is successfully convened; (3) The Soviet Union uses force to resolve the issue with Turkey. In short, no matter how the situation evolves, Turkey has adopted a final attitude, and this attitude has almost obtained the consent of Britain and the United States.

[Agence France-Presse, Turkish Capital, 20th] Regarding the Dardanelles Strait issue, Professor Huwei Oulin of Turkish diplomatic affairs recently published an article in a newspaper commenting that the exchange of notes between the Soviet Union and Turkey is tantamount to direct negotiations between the two countries, but it is not easy to make this negotiation consistent with the Montreux Convention. If the Soviet Union insists on its demands, it would be best to convene a meeting of the signatory countries to the Montreux Convention. Diplomatic officials here believe that Britain may initiate this meeting, but Turkey itself will not take this action. In any case, Turkey will have other countries convene this meeting.

At the same time, airplanes carrying representatives arrive at the New York airport every minute, and 240 people have already arrived.

[Report] San Francisco, 20th Broadcast: Molotov arrived in New York today. After disembarking, he told reporters: "I firmly believe that the differences between the United Nations can be satisfactorily resolved, and all difficulties can be overcome. The Soviet representatives are determined to strive for peace, because what the Soviet Union cares about is peace."

[Report] Paris, 21st Broadcast, New York News: Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov declared to new reporters on the "Queen Elizabeth" that the various problems submitted to the United Nations General Assembly may be resolved in a satisfactory way with good faith and a sincere hope for mutual understanding. Mr. Mo also said that the Soviet delegation hopes that the United Nations General Assembly and the Foreign Ministers Conference can proceed smoothly while taking into account the peace, interests, and well-being of all countries, large and small. The Soviet delegation will fulfill its contribution under such conditions.

### Trusteeship Issue

Internal Disagreements in the United States

[Report] San Francisco, 21st Broadcast: The Australian government today submitted a trusteeship agreement including New Guinea to the United Nations, requesting that the General Assembly approve it this time. The agreement stipulates that Australia will continue to manage New Guinea.

[Associated Press, Washington, 21st] Officials here said today that US Secretary of State Burns urgently wants to resolve the United States' policy on the United Nations Organization's trusteeship issue before he and President Truman go to New York on the 23rd of this month to attend the United Nations General Assembly. Regarding the trusteeship issue, the opinions of State Department officials and Army and Navy officials are still quite divided. General officials in the State Department support giving as much as possible the former Japanese and Japanese-mandated islands in the Pacific to the United Nations Organization for trusteeship. The Army and Navy want to keep all the islands necessary for the United States' security under the sole management of the United States. Burns is now working hard to reach an agreement as soon as possible, so that the US delegation can put forward concrete proposals when the United Nations Organization's Trusteeship Council is established soon.

### MacArthur Headquarters Released August Administrative Report Yesterday; More Than 180,000 Japanese Soldiers Dismissed; Food Shortage and High Cost of Living

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 21st] MacArthur released his August report on the administration of occupied Japan today, announcing that the Japanese government had dismissed 186,000 militaristic soldiers in the past year; but only 331 of the 15,992 teachers and educators who were reported were prohibited from teaching. The Ministry of Education is responsible for the cleansing work in the education sector.

This issue's report reflects the rising cost of living, with some price indices jumping from two to seven times. National debt increased to 220 billion yen. In the 20 days since the end of July, the amount of banknotes issued by the Bank of Japan increased to more than 5 billion yen. Although production figures have improved, the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare reported that 6.8 million people will be unemployed by the end of this year.

### Nehru Wounded; Bengal Province Moslem Riot Unabated; Crisis in Interim Government Imminent; Large Numbers of Indian Volunteers Rush to Affected Areas

[Our Report] Paris Radio, 21st: New Delhi Dispatch: Indian Interim Government Prime Minister Nehru and Abdul Ghaffar Khan, known as "Frontier Gandhi," were both attacked and wounded in a hostile demonstration today, but their injuries are not serious.

[United Press, New Delhi, 21st] After inspecting the troubled areas of Bengal Province, Congress Party Chairman Kripalani said in Calcutta today: Moslem looting, arson, murder, forced conversion, and abduction of women, forced marriage, etc., have been confirmed by Hindu refugees. In Tipbera alone, there are already 40,000 refugees, and the total number of deaths and injuries cannot be counted because the troubled areas are isolated from the outside world and cannot be penetrated. The instigating leaders are retired soldiers, using military methods to attack.

[United Press, New Delhi, 20th] The Hindu-Moslem conflict in eastern Bengal is likely to cause a crisis in the nascent interim government, or even lead to retaliatory actions in other parts of India. Criticism is directed at Indian Governor-General Wavell and Bengal Governor Bruce, blaming them for failing to take effective measures in the troubled areas to protect the Hindu population, which is only one-fifth of the Moslem population. This is the third time Nehru has been attacked on his tour. Indian Governor-General Wavell has flown to New Delhi by special plane after a three-day visit to Bombay.

[United Press, Calcutta, 20th] Bengal Premier Suhrawardy stated: Indian volunteers are heading to the Noakhali district in large numbers to rescue distressed women. The affected area of Noakhali is located at the northern tip of the Bay of Bengal. Moslems in the area, in partnership with bandits, began attacking the Hindu minority on the 20th of this month. The political motives behind this move are difficult to fathom; however, both Hindu and Moslem sides admit that the Moslems initiated the conflict.

### Municipal Cultural Construction Committee Holds Grand Peking Opera Performance to Celebrate Birthday; Proceeds from Ticket Sales to Fund School and Other Foundations

[Our Report] The Shanghai Southern Party Headquarters Cultural Movement Committee, in celebration of the Chairman's sixtieth birthday, has initiated a grand gathering of famous Peking Opera actors on the afternoon of the Chairman's birthday (the 31st of this month) at the Tianchan Theater, with the remaining proceeds from ticket sales to be used as cultural awards. Yesterday, the committee held a reception at the Kangle Restaurant for the city's cultural circles. Present were Pan Gongzhan, Chairman of the committee, Fang Zhi, Chairman of the City Party Headquarters, Vice-Speaker Xu Ji, Ouyang Zunquan, Chief of General Affairs of the Municipal Government representing Mayor Wu, as well as Wang Xiaolai, Liu Gongyun, Gu Chunfan, Director of the Finance Bureau, Li Mou, Deputy Director of the Education Bureau, Feng Youzhen, famous Peking Opera actors Zhou Xinfang, Jiang Miaoxiang, Ye Shengian, famous amateur singer Sun Lantian, and others, totaling forty people. Chairman Pan presided over the meeting, reporting that the Cultural Movement Committee has had close ties with the city's education, drama, news, and art circles, but has not used its name to make any external representations. This grand Peking Opera performance to celebrate the Chairman's sixtieth birthday is actually initiated and voluntarily performed by the Peking Opera circles. The ticket revenue, after deducting some necessary backstage expenses, will be used to fund schools. If there is a surplus, it will be used to establish a Zhongzheng Cultural Fund, with a management committee to categorize and set fixed amounts, only using the interest and not the principal. This award includes fine arts, sculpture, drama, art works, etc., and the first to be planned is a fund to improve Peking Opera. Ticket prices for the performance range from 4,000 yuan to 50,000 yuan, with 50 to 100 honorary seats available at 100,000 yuan per ticket, hoping that the industrial and commercial sectors will promote it. Finance Bureau Director Gu has agreed to waive donations, as this performance is held in the afternoon and is not within the scope of the Finance Bureau's budget, and this will not be followed as an example in the future.

Chairman Fang Zhi then stated that the Chairman has repeatedly instructed not to take any action, and the city's circles deeply admire the Chairman's good intentions. However, from the standpoint of the people, they should express their gratitude to the hardworking and meritorious Chairman, and donating to schools to celebrate his birthday has profound significance. After this Peking Opera performance, it is hoped that it will continue to develop and promote China's inherent art and promote the national essence internationally. The City Party Headquarters will always assist all sectors as much as possible.

Ouyang Zunquan, representing the Mayor, expressed his strong support for the Peking Opera circles celebrating the birthday and hoped that they would work hard to promote it. Zhou Xinfang said that the Peking Opera colleagues can only do their best to express their respect to the Chairman. It is of great significance that any surplus ticket revenue will be used for cultural awards. The improvement of Peking Opera originated in the early years of the Republic of China. Today, spoken drama has made progress, while Peking Opera still has feudal colors, and the improvement is urgently needed.

Finally, Wang Xiaolai stated that he hopes to promote cultural movements and not stop after this birthday celebration, but to continue to develop. Deputy Director Li of the Education Bureau also gave instructions on the promotion of culture and education.

Performance Program

### The Entire Lengths of the Nanjing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Highways Are Being Actively Repaired; It Is Expected That Both Will Be Open to Traffic in November and Are Planned to Be Reconstructed as [Super] Highways

[Our Report] The two major highways, Nanjing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou, are currently being actively repaired by the Highway Bureau of the Ministry of Communications. It is expected that the entire line of the Nanjing-Shanghai Road will be open to traffic in mid-November, and the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road will be open to traffic at the end of November. During the Anti-Japanese War, the roadbeds of these two major highways were almost completely destroyed. After strenuous repairs after the victory, the Xihu section of the Nanjing-Shanghai Road and the Hangjia section of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road can now be traveled on.

Asphalt Pavement

The Highway Bureau also plans to rebuild these two lines into "super" highways. Specific plans have already been drafted and are awaiting the final decision of the authorities. This "super" highway will not use cement but asphalt pavement, because although cement is more durable, its price is more than double that of asphalt. Based on current market prices, asphalt roads cost between 20,000 and 30,000 National Currency per square meter. The construction of the "super" highway will be a joint effort between the Highway Bureau of the Ministry of Communications and the Municipal Government Public Works Bureau, because more than 13 kilometers of the Nanjing-Shanghai Road and more than 7 kilometers of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road are within the city limits. At that time, the Municipal Government plans to petition the Central Government for subsidies to help with road repair costs.

In addition, in order to strengthen the Southeast transportation system, the Highway Bureau is building the following road lines: (1) Shanghai to Zhitang Line (via Liuhe, Taicang), (2) Hangzhou to Shangyu Line (goods combined transportation with Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway), (3) Nanjing to Luhe Line (via Wuhu, ), (4) Hefei to Yuhan Line (via Shuijiahu), (5) Nanton to Yantan Line, etc.

It is learned that the office has signed a contract with the Materials Supply Bureau. A large number of vehicles will arrive in Shanghai in the short term.

He then continued to No. 32 Peideri, Datong Road, and obtained Ma Jiliang, Xu Guobiao, Yang Shaobing, etc., and found

all the stolen goods. He then went to the Zhonghua Department Store at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road and obtained suspect Song Wenqing, etc., and brought them all to the police station for questioning. According to the plaintiff Zhao Xuewen: Yu's brother Zhao Wanshun was working as an accountant at the Zhonghua Department Store. Recently, he borrowed a huge amount of 100 million yuan at high interest from colleagues to do speculative business, and issued two checks from the Guohua Bank. Later, because his brother was unable to pay, he left without saying goodbye, and there has been no news for many days. On the 14th, he received a suicide note from his brother, and it is not known whether he has committed suicide. Unexpectedly, today Song Wenqing, an employee of the Zhonghua Department Store, led four people in uniform and carrying guns to rob the rice and other items. Song Wenqing said: I am a colleague of Zhao Wanshun. Zhao had asked me to borrow a large amount of money from my friend Ma Jiliang. When the due date arrived, he ignored it and fled privately. I have not seen him for many days and sent a suicide note, so I notified Ma Jiliang, who invited many people to move the goods. Ma Jiliang confessed: I have no occupation and rely on lending for a living. I was introduced by Song Wenqing to raise millions of yuan to lend to Zhao Wanshun. When the due date arrived, he did not return it and fled. I heard the news and was anxious. I discussed it with my relative He Bangduo and drove a car to the rice shop set up by Zhao to take the rice to make up for the debt. He Bangduo said that I am a retired soldier. I was introduced by Ma Jiliang to lend Zhao Wanshun 2 million yuan. Now Zhao has fled and there is no trace, so I was anxious and went to his shop to move the goods. Xu Guoliang, Yang Shaobing, and others confessed that they were invited by Ma Jiliang to move the rice, and first transported the truck to San口, North Sichuan Road, and then hired a Bingan Transportation Company truck to transport it to No. 32 Peideri, Datong Road, for storage. The director ordered them to be detained and await the recording of confessions to be sent to the Prosecutor's Office for investigation.

It turned out that Gu Dayingzi coveted the beauty of Zhang Jinhong (21 years old, from Nantong), a young woman at No. 64 Weixin Lane, Pingliang Road, and intended to act improperly. Because he was hindered by her mother-in-law, Wu Yu氏, he could not succeed.

The ringleader is a seasoned thief with 30 years of "experience," named Chen Xianglin from Pudong. He is not only able to fire guns with both hands, but also able to load bullets with one hand. Therefore, he carried as many as three firearms when committing the robbery. Before the robbery, he and his accomplices planned it at the Bund Park. During the robbery, they followed a plan to lure employees into an inner room, then assigned one thief to sit guard at the counter, pretending to be a staff member, to prevent passersby from suspecting anything. This allowed them to search and loot at will. Before leaving, they fired a shot as a warning. After the incident, Director Xuan was extremely angry and ordered his subordinates to solve the case. On the 14th of this month, the North Railway Station Police Branch received a tip-off and arrested one of his accomplices, Tang Asan from Changshu, at No. 51 Gaohouli, Tiantong Road. He confessed to having committed five crimes, the last of which was the Asia Money Exchange robbery. Subsequently, the police station arrested the ringleader at the same location. However, the ringleader maintained a "heroic" posture at the police station and refused to disclose the whereabouts of his accomplices. He only confessed that he had been robbing for thirty years, had been imprisoned twice, and each time sentenced to fifteen years, before being released after the victory [of the war]. The police station then received a report that his accomplices were hiding somewhere in Dachang. They rushed there immediately, but the accomplices had already fled an hour before the police arrived, having gotten wind of the news. On the 19th, the police station received another report that they had fled to Suzhou. They immediately dispatched plainclothes chief detective Zhang Shide and other officers to investigate the Mudu area of Suzhou. As of yesterday, there were still no leads. However, the names of the accomplices are known to be Ji Guoliang, Tao Guoliang, Guo Bing, Yu Lin, and four others. The two arrested criminals will be sent to the Preparatory Department for interrogation in accordance with the law within the next few days.

### Suspects Arrested in Shangchuan Railway Robbery Case

[Our Newspaper's Report] On the 18th, near the Xinlu Station of the Shangchuan Railway in Pudong, the train was surrounded by thirty to forty bandits who robbed male and female passengers, amounting to five to six hundred people, resulting in significant losses.

Subsequently, they joined forces with over a hundred members of the local self-defense corps from Nanhui and Chuansha, and set out to search and pursue separately, proceeding to the border area between Nanhui and Chuansha, searching house by house. As of 2:00 PM yesterday, seven suspects had been arrested and are currently being interrogated at the Yangjing Branch Bureau.

### The Inside Story of Shanghai's Pickpocketing Gangs (II)

— Huang Jiamo

Agility and Alertness Essential for Success

In order to ensure a "constant stream of talent," the pickpocketing gangs have a variety of methods for stealing money. The most promising group is called "Eating Rice," which is a general term for the various techniques that directly harm our citizens. I will first describe the organization and activities of the "Eating Rice" group, and then discuss the other gangs later. "Eating Rice" is gang slang for "eating improper food." Although there are many routes of activity, in a nutshell, it is nothing more than "stealing and deception." The "outlaws" who "join" the "Eating Rice" gang are all well-groomed and neatly dressed. Since this gang engages in illegal activities, it is most likely to be caught. Therefore, they must be agile and alert to be successful. In gang slang, this is called "Linglongzi Dancing Yao."

Those who engage in "eating bad rice" must apprentice and join the gang. The master is the "Grand Uncle Team" in each area. The position of the "Grand Uncle" is like a director in a theater troupe, who must have the "eye for talent." After making a decision, they instruct them to learn various specialized pickpocketing techniques, divided into categories, like choosing elective courses in college. Once they graduate, they can go out and "face the world."

The most promising activity in the "eating bad rice" gang is "hard pickpocketing," which means forceful snatching. This group has the largest number of members and the most important distribution areas. Since the introduction of European customs, women in the city must carry handbags when they go out. The "hard pickpocketing" brothers regard snatching these handbags as their most proud masterpiece. They work in groups of two or three, and must first observe the situation before striking. After snatching on the road, they hand it over to gang members who run wildly into the dark alleys and disappear in an instant. If it is a dark and secluded road, weak women cannot resist, making it even easier to strike. However, if the police force is strong in the bustling city, or there are many pedestrians, they dare not act rashly. However, this trend has not been popular for many years, because many women only carry the appearance, and the handbags contain very limited cash. Even if they sell the old handbags, they are not worth much. Therefore, they have shifted their attention to various women's accessories. It turns out that the "hard pickpocketing" gang has the ability to identify gold jewelry, so they will never snatch fake jewelry. They have established the following slang for gold jewelry:

Original Name

Slang

Gold Bracelet Cuff

Dig Ear Garlic

Earring Canopy

Hairpin Bolt

Watch Unsettled Heart

Diamond-set Add Scattered Flowers

### Friends of the Military Society Launches Membership Drive

Since its relocation from Chongqing to Shanghai after last year's victory, the Friends of the Military Society has spared no effort in serving soldiers and promoting cooperation between the military and civilians, leaving a good impression on both sides. Last night at 7:00 PM, the society held a banquet at the Friends of the Military Club on Zhapu Road to welcome figures from the Party, government, military, business, and society, and reported on the society's business and future plans. Over fifty people were in attendance including Commander Tang Enbo, Mayor Wu Guozhen, Commander Xuan Tiewu, Committee Director Fang Zhi, Speaker Pan Gongzhan, Inspector Cheng Zhongxing, as well as He Yaozu, Du Yuesheng, Wu Shaoshu, He Dequi, Liu Gongyun, Wang Xiaolai, Xu Jizhuang, Fan Shaozeng, Xu Jiguan, Gu Jiatang, Feng Youzhen, Qin Runqing, Liu Hongsheng, Hu Xiyuan, Wang Zhixin, Shu Yunzhang, Rong Hongyuan, Jin Runxiang, Yu Shuping, Xie Renzhao, Yang Guanbei, Yang Jizhang, and Hu Jingru. The event was a great success. After taking their seats, Liu Deming, the president of the society, first reported on the founding of the Friends of the Military Society and a summary of its business since its relocation to Shanghai last year. He also expressed that in order to expand the Friends of the Military movement, he plans to launch a membership drive and asks for assistance from all sectors. Commander Tang then delivered a speech, followed by a speech by Fang Xikong, director of the Municipal Party Department, who stated: "The saying that the military and civilians are united as one" is often seen in slogans, but rarely in reality. During the Northern Expedition, I was responsible for the political work of the army. The people endured hardships and supported the injured, and the hospitality of the people towards the Northern Expeditionary Army was sincere and moving. The reason for this was that the people deeply knew that the purpose of the Northern Expedition was to eliminate the warlords and achieve revolution. This is an example of military-civilian friendship and cooperation before the establishment of the Friends of the Military Society. During the War of Resistance, military-civilian cooperation had improved, but I firmly believe that if the Friends of the Military Society could have been established earlier, it would have reduced some misunderstandings and troubles between the military and civilians and made a significant contribution to the War of Resistance. The task of reorganizing the army and building the country in the future is arduous. I hope that the Friends of the Military movement will be carried forward to fulfill its mission. Speaker Pan Gongzhan then delivered a speech, stating: The Friends of the Military Society has been established in Shanghai for a year and has achieved remarkable results. With the advocacy and support of the Party Department and all sectors in the future, its future development will be considerable. I firmly believe that in another year, the Friends of the Military movement will be widely launched, and its gains can be imagined. Inspector Cheng Zhongxing then delivered a speech, stating: I have always advocated caring for soldiers, repaying soldiers, and serving soldiers. The purpose and mission of the Friends of the Military Society are exactly the same. In the future, I will often use the power of public opinion to help realize this ideal, but how to proceed is still under planning, in order to gain widespread support. I believe that the organization of the Youth Association and its methods of soliciting members can be used as a reference. Under the call of the Friends of the Military movement in the future, any topic proposed by the society, whether it is soliciting members or raising funds, will be fully committed to promoting its success. Commander Xuan Tiewu then delivered a speech, stating: Standing in the position of a soldier, I am very grateful for the hospitality and service of the Friends of the Military Society. The Friends of the Military Society has heavy responsibilities and the work is not easy. In the future, under the guidance and assistance of the leaders, there are great hopes for the development of the work. I am currently serving in the military in Shanghai. I firmly believe that the Friends of the Military Society's service and help to the military can also reduce many difficulties for me. Since Du Yuesheng has not recovered his strength, Chairman Xu of the Chamber of Commerce delivered a speech on his behalf, stating: I am deeply moved to be here today. Before the September 18th Incident, the Japanese entertained the banking community in this house. Coming back here today, I feel both emotional and happy. I believe that the work of the Friends of the Military Society is very meaningful. In the past, Zeng Guofan governed with the principle of not disturbing the people. Commander Tang not only does not disturb the people, but also strives to promote the military as friends of the people. Last year, when the Japanese surrendered, Commander Tang was the first to arrive in Shanghai. All Shanghai merchants were grateful for his kindness. Today, I would like to take this opportunity to thank Commander Tang on behalf of Mr. Du Yuesheng. In the future, the relationship between the military and civilians will become closer. I hope everyone will support the Friends of the Military movement and expand it. Later, Speaker Pan and Du Yuesheng proposed to launch a membership drive for the Friends of the Military Society and organize a Friends of the Military Society Membership Drive Committee. All those present were standing committee members. They drafted a plan and proceeded in teams. It was unanimously approved and it was decided to convene a preparatory meeting in the shortest possible time.

### Railway Corruption Case Nearing Verdict; Railway Bureau Sends Another Letter to the District Court Providing Key Reference Points; Yu Xiangyan, Third Secretary of the Bureau, Entirely Fabricated Facts; Shop Commissions Come from the Customer's Pocket; Benefits Gained by Offenders are Losses to the Public

[Our Newspaper's Report] The corruption case at the Materials Department of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway is scheduled for sentencing on the morning of the 24th, after two trials and closing arguments concluded at the District Court. The Railway Bureau again sent a letter to the District Court yesterday, detailing the entire case process to provide as a reference. An excerpt of the original text follows: We respectfully inform you that in the embezzlement case of our Bureau's Materials Department, after the first court hearing by your esteemed Court on September 20th of this year, due to the defendants' deceptive and largely untrue statements, we submitted a letter on October 2nd regarding the internal personnel and handling of embezzlement cases for your consideration. Subsequently, on the 17th of this month, during the second hearing by your esteemed Court, our Bureau again sent personnel to observe and record the defendants' testimonies on-site. We found that the testimonies of key individuals were inconsistent and largely inaccurate. Therefore, we are submitting a supplementary statement to your esteemed Court for consideration. The details are as follows:

Regarding Zhang Hongtu's portion

(A) Zhang Hongtu's testimony in court again involved Zhang Bokang's background and his relationship with him. It is important to note that both Zhang Honggang and Zhang Bokang were staff members of the Materials Department of the Ministry of Transportation before holding positions in our Bureau. Prior to my being ordered to take over the Beijing-Shanghai area last year, I had no personal acquaintance with either of them. Zhang Bokang was assigned by the Ministry as an accompanying staff member for the takeover, and Zhang Honggang was assigned by the Ministry as the head of the Materials Department. Zhang Bokang's assignment as the head of the Purchasing Section was at the request of Zhang Honggang. This shows that Zhang Honggang's claim that Zhang Bokang was brought by me and was not his personal associate is not true. As for the matter of replacing Zhang Bokang, I had decided to replace him around April due to rumors about the Materials Department both inside and outside the Bureau. I repeatedly asked fair-minded individuals with positions in political circles, such as Shen Yi, Yin Zhongrong, and Zhang Ziguan, to recommend potential replacements. Before the case was exposed, I had informed Zhang Hongtu of my intention to replace Zhang Bokang. Knowing that I was determined to replace Zhang Bokang, he soon introduced another person in an attempt to cover up the issue. By this time, rumors of Zhang Honggang's illegal activities had already spread, so of course I did not consider the person he recommended. The detailed process is also described in our Bureau's letter to your esteemed Court on October 2nd, which shows that Zhang Honggang's claim that he suggested replacing the person, but I refused, is a clear distortion of the facts.

(B) Zhang Honggang also testified: "The testimony I gave last time (referring to the first court hearing testimony) is completely different from today. I want to overturn the second testimony. The testimony about the Railway Bureau is completely wrong. Director Chen changed my testimony. Director Chen should be responsible for this." It is important to note that Zhang Honggang's first hearing was questioned openly by the presiding judge of your esteemed court. His testimony, freely given, was as clear as the sun and stars. Yet, he dares to use excuses to overturn it, which shows the inconsistency of his testimony. According to Zhang, he was questioned at the Railway Bureau by Police Chief Wang Zhaohu, and recorded by Liang Zhan, the section chief of the Document Section. This was also a free statement. If your esteemed Court wishes to know the details of the questioning at that time, you can summon Wang and Liang to the court for questioning. However, in Zhang Honggang's mind, the court hearing record can be overturned, so the Railway Bureau's questioning record can be denied at will. This is not my intention to change his testimony, but rather his own desire to change it. If Zhang Hongtu tells the truth, his words should be consistent throughout. However, because he intends to be cunning and tells lies, no matter how hard he tries to be careful, there will be loopholes in the end, which is what is meant by trying to hide the truth only to reveal it.

(C) Zhang Honggang generally does not admit to his criminal behavior or blames it on his wife, Yu Xiangyan. In reality, Zhang and Yu are husband and wife, and they are together day and night. He started the wrongdoing by Zhang Honggang deliberately holding back the purchase orders. Then, Zhu Biwen suggested Zhang Kaiyuan, and Zhang Kaiyuan informed Zhang Bokang that he had to cooperate with the director's wife. Zhu Biwen is Yu Xiangyan's personal friend, and Zhang Hongtu employed him to be a tool for making money. How could Zhang Honggang not know this? This is one point. Materials Department staff such as Zhang Bokang went in and out of their house day and night, and were very familiar with Yu Xiangyan. Zhang Honggang could see and hear this. His occasional deliberate avoidance was to collude with Yu to cover up the wrongdoing. This is the second point. Zhang Hongtu claimed to know that Yu Xiangyan had money, and also claimed that he did not know where Yu Xiangyan's money came from. Why didn't Zhang ask? If he said it was from business, then he couldn't point out what kind of business and the details. This shows that what he was engaged in was the corruption of the Materials Department. This is the third point. It is not uncommon for one spouse to commit a crime and conceal it successfully, without the other spouse knowing. However, the corruption lasted for more than half a year, the property suddenly increased, the subordinates were in close contact, and the crime was related to his own responsible affairs. In addition, there are testimonies from accomplices that are unfavorable to him, such as the testimonies of Zhang Bokang and Zhu Biwen. Zhang Honggang's criminal evidence is solid and there is no doubt about it.

Regarding Yu Xiangyan's portion

(A) Yu Xiangyan disappeared after the case was discovered. I personally went with the Police Chief Wang Zhaohu to search at the Weiguang Hospital and other places pointed out by Zhang Hongtu at 4:00 AM on June 25th. The next day, Chief Wang Zhaohu went to Zhu Rongsheng's house, another location provided by Zhang Hongtu, at 2:00 AM, but there was no trace of her. Then, Zhang Hongtu was escorted to your esteemed Court, and the Songhu Garrison Headquarters was sent a document requesting assistance in apprehending Yu Xiangyan and bringing her to justice. Zhang Hongtu himself confessed that Chen Bozhuang detained me and wanted me to hand over Yu Xiangyan, which shows that I have done my best to pursue Yu Xiangyan. The details of the process can be found in our Bureau's letter to the Procuratorate on July 10th. Yu Xiangyan's claim that she met with me three times is entirely false. As for Yu Xiangyan's criminal behavior, there is the testimony of Zhang Bokang and others to prove it. She received 24 million [currency unit unspecified] in bribes. Other defendants have confirmed this. How can Yu deny it alone? Furthermore, Zhu Biwen is indeed Yu's confidant, and Zhu Biwen was the first to suggest that Zhang Bokang cooperate with her. Zhu also confessed that Yu Xiangyan used the excuse of buying a piano to promote the corruption. This is very clear. As for Yu Xiangyan's random accusations in an attempt to escape punishment, she first blamed me, because I advocated a thorough investigation of this case. Then, she blamed Zhang Yunhe, claiming that Yunhe was a stepping stone. Then, she insulted the prosecutors, because they represented the state in filing the public prosecution. Finally, she even insulted the dignity of the entire judiciary. The more she slanders, the more obvious her crime becomes. Because Yu's behavior is improper and she does everything, it is appropriate that she is bold and reckless. After committing the crime, she still does not repent. If this person and Zhang Honggang are not severely punished by the law, then the principles of justice will not exist, and how can we expect to cleanse the government?

Regarding Zhang Bokang's portion

Zhang Bokang's lawyer argued on his behalf: "If it is said that Zhang Bokang colluded with merchants to collect commissions, then this commission is also recognized by the Railway Bureau. Otherwise, how could the Railway Bureau go to the merchants after the case was discovered and forcibly collect money to make up the amount of the commission?" It is important to note that the defendants in this case colluded with merchants to collect commissions. In ordinary commercial transactions, there may be the wisdom of so-called commissions. However, as a public official, receiving a salary from the government, one should maintain integrity and not directly or indirectly seek profit in the affairs under one's management or supervision. If there is any attempt to seek profit, no matter what the commercial name is, it is considered embezzlement under the law. The reason why our Bureau thoroughly investigated this case and sent it to the court for investigation is precisely because it does not recognize that the commission system should exist in public institutions. Furthermore, the source of the commission is not the selling merchant who can take it out of his own pocket and feed the tiger. It is actually selling the goods at a higher price. As the common saying goes, "The wool comes from the sheep." Therefore, the profit gained by the offender is the loss to the public. And before the merchant, who has received the payment, has not deducted this illegal profit and handed it over to the offender, it is called stolen money for the merchant who has been convicted, and it is called unjust enrichment for the merchant who has not been convicted. Our Bureau must recover it according to law. Therefore, the railway police were sent to accompany the offenders to the merchants to collect the stolen money. If this is referred to as the Bureau recognizing the commission, and therefore the defendants can be relieved of their guilt, there is no room for such a distortion logically or legally. In summary, we respectfully submit this letter for your consideration. Respectfully, to the Criminal Division of the Shanghai District Court.

### Sa Benju's Case of Marrying While His Wife Was Still Alive Sentenced to Four Months; Plaintiff Dissatisfied

[Our Newspaper's Report] The case of Sa Benju, the nephew of the famous naval veteran Admiral Sa Zhenbing, being sued by his wife for bigamy, was concluded by the District Court after three trials. Yesterday, Judge Meng announced the verdict: Sa Benju was sentenced to four months of imprisonment for having continuous adultery while having a spouse, and Shi Biren was sentenced to four months of imprisonment for continuously having adultery with someone who had a spouse. If the sentence is commuted to a fine, it will be calculated at 500 [currency unit unspecified] per day. The civil suit was dismissed as incidental. The two defendants, Sa and Shi, were not present in court yesterday. Only their lawyers attended the hearing. After hearing the verdict, the plaintiff, Ms. Chen Jizheng, believed that if the sentence was commuted to a fine, four months would only require 60,000 [currency unit unspecified], and the two of them would only need 120,000 [currency unit unspecified]. She expressed dissatisfaction and will appeal.

### Li Fang Sentenced to Three Years; Zhang Genshou and Sun Xiaolin Each Sentenced to Four Years

[Our Newspaper's Report] Li Fang was sentenced to three years of imprisonment by the High Court yesterday, with three years of deprivation of civil rights. All of his property, except for the necessary living expenses for his family, was confiscated. It is important to note that Li Fang, also known as Li Lianfang, with the alias Qinglian Jushi, is 52 years old this year and is from Huangpi, Hubei. He has been serving in the diplomatic community. In the 26th year of the Republic [1937], he resigned from his position as the Consul-General in Novosibirsk. After returning to China, he was transferred to Guangzhou to handle diplomatic affairs with the British and Americans in Hong Kong until he came to Shanghai in the 27th year [1938]. Later, he was appointed by the puppet government as the "Minister" to Romania and the "Ambassador" to Germany, concurrently serving as the "Minister" to Hungary. During the sentencing yesterday, the presiding judge briefly explained the reasons for the verdict, stating: Li Fang participated in a meeting of the puppet government in Shanghai in the 29th year [1940], and after the 30th year [1941], he repeatedly received orders from the puppet government as a diplomatic envoy, and privately discussed "overall peace" with Kawaki, the director of the enemy army's Shanghai office. His actions of collaborating with the enemy cannot be denied. However, he did not take office for any of the puppet positions, and the private discussion of "peace" was initiated by Kawamoto, so the circumstances were not significant. Furthermore, he had assisted Hubei in transporting legal tender to Kunming during his time in Hong Kong, which was beneficial to the War of Resistance to some extent. Therefore, the sentence was reduced. Li did not express any feelings after hearing the verdict, but his wife and daughters cried incessantly. The court allowed him to meet with his family briefly before being taken back to prison. In addition, the High Court also sentenced Zhang Genshou and Sun Xiaolin, who were suspected of being traitors, to four years of imprisonment each.

### Jin Xiongbo to Be Sentenced on the 28th; Zhang Sumin Interrogated Yesterday

On the same day, the two cases of Jin Xiongbo, the president of the puppet Pingbao newspaper, and Elizi, a Hungarian national, being accused of providing gasoline and alcohol to the enemy, were concluded. Both are scheduled for sentencing in the morning and afternoon of the 28th of this month.

Zhang Tao, the president of the puppet Supreme Court, and Zhang Sumin, who served as the director of the Customs Administration of the puppet Ministry of Finance and the director of the Enemy Property Management Office of the puppet Ministry of Finance, were interrogated by the High Court yesterday morning and ordered to be detained for further interrogation at a later date.

[Another News] The High Procuratorate has filed a case against Chen Boyun, Gao Feng, Xu Xiuting and others on suspicion of being traitors.

The High Court is scheduled to try Li Zuyu, Wang Hongding, Shen Fenggang, Huang Tianzu, Wu Changgui, and Zhou Genyao this morning. In the afternoon, it will try the case of Zhang Lianfang and others.

### Girl Brutally Stabbed While Doing Her Hair

[Our Report] Xu Bingyun, a 20-year-old girl from Pudong, residing at 703 Huangpi South Road, works in a sock factory. Last year, she had a physical relationship with Wang Gende (27 years old, leather suitcase maker, residing at 688 Xiaonanmen), a fellow villager. In February of this year, she ran away with Wang without her mother's knowledge and lived with him in the kitchen shed at 97 South District Street in the South City. Because Wang's income was insufficient, her mother took her back in July. After Wang Gende found out Xu Bingyun's address and the location of her factory, he repeatedly met with her, wanting to run away together again. After she refused, Wang harbored resentment. Yesterday morning around 6 a.m., Wang, armed with a sharp knife, broke into the girl's residence. The girl was doing her hair. Wang took out his knife and stabbed her arms and legs six times. Blood flowed all over the floor. The girl screamed in pain.

### Administration and Relief to Develop China's Fisheries, Will Recruit Technicians, Hire American Experts for Training

[Our Report] In order to develop China's fisheries and improve fishing technology, the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration will soon recruit fishery personnel and hire American fishery experts to train them. According to Li Xiangyuan, senior technician and director of the first group of the Agricultural Committee of the Administration and Relief, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) currently has 31 new fishing boats, moored at Fuxing Island, under the administration of the Administration and Relief. Each of these ships has seven American fishing boat crew members. Currently, they are using these ships for experimental purposes, such as testing whether equipment and fishing nets are suitable for fishing in Chinese rivers or oceans.

The training period is about one year

The Administration and Relief has not yet decided on the specific methods, qualifications, and quotas for recruiting students. However, it is planned that graduates of aquatic product schools are most suitable for applying. After being admitted, it is planned to use UNRRA fishing boats for training, tentatively training on the ship for two months, river or coastal training for three months, and then interning in rivers and seas for half a year. During the training period, the Administration and Relief will provide expenses. After graduation, they will be assigned to various fishery organizations and institutions to serve.

### A Batch of Fishing Boats to be Received Next Spring

These 31 fishing boats will be received by the Administration and Relief after UNRRA ends next March. However, the entire plan must be discussed with the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry before a decision is made. In the future, the received ships are still planned to be sold to fishermen, fishery companies, groups, institutions, etc., but fishermen who have suffered losses due to the war will be given priority. In addition, the Administration and Relief has received several UNRRA tractors, which will also recruit technical personnel for training and use in the near future. The training locations are tentatively set in rural Hubei and Guangxi.

### Dispute over Competition for Fish Transport Unresolved, Tricycle Drivers Suddenly Attack Trucks

(Our Report) The dispute between tricycles and trucks competing for the business of transporting fish at the fish market has been mediated by the fish market, as reported in this newspaper. It is unexpected that the opinions of both sides have not been reached. Yesterday morning at around 4 a.m., more than 100 tricycle drivers secretly gathered and suddenly attacked trucks on their way to the fish market in the Badaitou area of Yangshupu, resulting in Yu Genlin, a fishmonger from Shanhaiguan Road, being seriously injured, and more than a dozen others suffering minor injuries. Two trucks were damaged. After receiving the report, the Yulin Road Police Station immediately reported to the Inspectorate of the General Bureau, which dispatched duty officer Zhang Xianghu and 30 armed police officers to suppress the situation. More than 50 workers were arrested on the spot, detained at the branch for interrogation, and the injured were rushed to the hospital for treatment.

### Answering Readers, Medicine and Health

(1) Kidney Stone Disease

Wu Asks: In early April, I suddenly felt a severe pain in my right waist. I asked a doctor to inject painkillers and two injections of penicillin, and I gradually felt calm. After a few weeks, I felt pain in that area again. I suspected it was kidney disease, so I went to a hospital to test my urine. The results showed pus cells, red blood cells, and a small amount of protein. More than a month ago, a small stone was discharged in my urine. The big ones are kidney stones. I have taken Helmitol six or seven times and injected 1.2 million units of penicillin, but it has not worked. Recently, a doctor friend of mine ordered me to take sixty tablets of Sulfamerazine and said that the disease is pyelitis (caused by tonsillitis). I don’t know how effective Sulfamerazine is, what the reaction is, and how to interpret this disease. What are the active treatment methods? I would like to ask for an answer.

[Answer by Doctor of Medicine Tang Renjin] The disease may be pyelitis caused by kidney stones. The efficacy of Sulfamerazine is as an anti-inflammatory and sterilizing agent. The reaction can sometimes stimulate the gastric mucosa, causing loss of appetite and nausea. You should take more diuretics and fluids. For active treatment, you can ask a urologist to perform kidney pelvis lavage, which may be effective.

(2) Nosebleeds

Zhu Yuxiang asks: My second son had measles when he was four years old. The following year, he suddenly had nosebleeds. Since then, it has occurred eight or nine times or three or four times a year. He has been treated by Chinese and Western doctors, but it has been ineffective. He is now thirteen years old, thin, and his appetite has decreased. Now his nosebleeds have occurred again, with a lot of bleeding. He needs medical treatment urgently. I don’t know if there is a specific medicine to treat this disease. Please answer.

[Answer by Doctor of Medicine Tang Renjin] There is no specific medicine for nosebleeds. You should check for systemic diseases (such as checking the stool for parasites at his age) and treat them. For local bleeding, a nose specialist can perform chemical cauterization or electrical cauterization, which is often effective.

### Mayor Wu Decides Cotton Yarn Will Be Re-Allocated Once More Allocation Amount is 10,529 Pieces Raw Material Price Allocation and Other Sub-Committees Established

[Our Report] At 3 p.m. yesterday, Mayor Wu convened representatives of the cotton spinning, dyeing and weaving, and replication industries to discuss concrete measures to suppress the price of yarn and cloth. Responsible persons from the six districts of the cotton spinning industry, dyeing and weaving industry, knitting industry, towel and blanket industry, yarn industry, and cotton cloth handkerchiefs attended. First, the mayor delivered a speech, stating that the last meeting decided that each association should report its production equipment, production quantity, required raw material quantity, and last month's production and sales situation to the meeting. However, each association has not fully complied so far. For items such as the quantity of goods sold, they have not been able to fill in truthfully, making auditing and allocation difficult. In the future, it is hoped that each association will cooperate fully with the government to handle matters truthfully so that a reasonable and fair price can be determined.

Wang Qiyu said that the price increase of yarn and cloth is due to insufficient supply. Sales in other ports are very strong, especially in Guangzhou, where the price of 20-count yarn has reached 3.8 to 3.9 million yuan. Ports such as Wuhu have also reached 2.8 million yuan. In addition, raw material prices are high. Manufacturers want to use American cotton, but foreign exchange requests are not easy to obtain. At the same time, the power supply is insufficient, and production cannot be maximized. As for the yarn allocation issue for yarn shops, because yarn shops are not sellers but agents for replication factories in other ports, yarn allocation should be allocated in the same way.

Shu Yunzhang said, (1) For future allocation, the previous ratio of 60% for private enterprises and 40% for building and spinning will be tried again once. (2) The government should provide a large amount of foreign exchange for the purchase of American cotton. If domestic cotton is insufficient, it will only be possible to purchase it from abroad.

Mayor Wu finally decided, (1) The supply and demand of yarn and cloth and various relationships make it difficult to be suitable at present, but it must be allocated in a reasonable way to curb the black market. (2) Foreign exchange cotton purchases are often requested from the Executive Yuan, which is transferred to the Central Bank for processing. (3) The power supply was previously agreed to be reduced for user power. The Municipal Council has now agreed, and it will be implemented soon. (4) Develop the Southeast Asian yarn and cloth market to earn foreign exchange. (5) As for what Manager Shu said about trying another allocation recently, according to the monthly yarn requirement reported by each association, which is 26,055 pieces, it was decided to allocate 10,529 pieces first to meet the urgent needs of each factory. (6) The allocation price is based on the cost of raw materials and labor, plus reasonable profits and preparation fees. (7) For yarn allocation, each trade association will change to allocating according to the actual needs of each factory. (8) Each association should report the finished products, quantity, cost, and sales customers of the allocated yarn in detail for auditing. Then, Deputy Director Li supplemented Mayor Wu's opinions on the decision-making method. Each trade association (1) should form a research group on the quantity of raw materials needed in order to statistically determine the exact amount of raw materials currently needed by manufacturers in the industry, (2) should form an evaluation group to evaluate the factory sales prices of finished products based on the cost of raw materials and labor and reasonable profits, and (3) should form an allocation group to supervise the actual sales of finished products by each manufacturer.

### Building and Spinning Allocation as Usual, Prices Not Changed

The China Building and Spinning Company opened for yarn distribution yesterday as usual, selling 380 and a half pieces. The allocation price remained the same. 20-count Shuiyue allocated to the underwear and towel associations and the Changzhou handicraft industry. 30-count Lanfeng allocated to knitting (from number 147 to number 307) and the handicraft association. 42-count Lanfeng allocated to the dyeing and weaving industry (from number 1 to number 161).

### Yarn Market Holds Firm

The yarn market continued to hold firm yesterday. In the early morning, the price of each brand was shouted as high as 5.7 million yuan. Sales were not quiet, so the situation was very stable. Before the close of the market, the supply was slightly abundant, so it fell by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. As a result, it rose by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan compared to last weekend.

### Few Bond Transactions

The bond market was mediocre, with few transactions. The process was stagnant. Tongbing opened at 2,200 yuan and zero, and was immediately supplied by many retail investors. It gradually fell to within 2,100 yuan to close. As a result, it fell by 40 yuan compared to last Saturday. Miscellaneous brands were still flat. A, B, D, and E each rose by 30 yuan.

### Chinese Stock Market Sentiment Declines, Limited Transactions in the Market

Chinese stocks closed even weaker. Selling pressure was still rampant. In the early morning, each stock rose slightly. After the opening, there were foreign stock accounts that came to buy, and it was slightly stable. However, there were sellers from the yarn and cloth group, and the rise was blocked. After 9:40, the decline became stronger. The market was unusually quiet, and buyers disappeared. It fell slightly step by step. At 11:10, Yongsha broke 720 yuan, showing the most tired state. Five minutes later, there were buyers from the Guangdong gang. It recovered slightly after hitting a low, but the transactions were limited, and it was unable to sustain. Soon it fell again. After 11:40, the banking gang bought a little, and number 176 and others also bought. The situation was slightly different. Before the close, the bulls and bears competed with each other, presenting a stalemate. The morning close was slightly fixed. Compared to last Saturday, popular stocks except for Xinguang, which was flat, all fell slightly. Only the company was stable among the cold stocks, and the rest fell. The afternoon opening was stable, and there were few transactions, causing anxiety among the bulls. In addition, number 143 came to sell Yongsha and Idichet. After 2:30, the decline suddenly started. Yongsha, Meiya, and others saw low prices again, but the bulls and bears took advantage of it. Near the close, the outlook was good. China Silk once fell to 5,130 yuan, the limit down, and finally quickly recovered. As a result, compared to last Saturday, the popular stocks Yongsha, Meiya, Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing each fell by about 3%. Xinli only fell slightly. Among the cold stocks, Tongyi Underwear, Xinya Match, and Huafeng Cement fell slightly. China Silk, China Textile, Datong, and Rongfeng each fell by about 50%. The company Jinglun and Lian were stable. The gains and losses of each stock outside the market were very small.

Foreign stocks were initially stable and then tired. High prices were still difficult to sustain. The initial high was followed by a low, and then it hovered near the close. As a result, compared with last Saturday, Yeguang, Yi Sha, Paper Industry, Yipi, and Steel Industry fell. Huidet fell by 50%, and the UK Union Airlines rose slightly.

### Gold Price Weakens Slightly, Foreign Currencies Stable

The Shanghai bare metal remained stable yesterday. The morning opening was 2,225,000. After the opening, the situation was stable. However, there was some closing of the week's floating, which once declined slightly. After 10 a.m., the Central Bank allocated 150 bars at a price of 2,217,500, and it was even more mediocre after that. However, because there were not many transactions, it once fell slightly to 2,208,000. At noon, it still stood at around 2,215,000. There were even fewer transactions in the afternoon, and the market price turned slightly weak. As a result, it fell by 15,000 compared to last Saturday. The listed price of jewelry in silver shops did not change. Sterling silver was flat and silver dollars fell slightly. The implicit interest rate for silver was inconsistent. The securities industry was looser, and miscellaneous industries were slightly tighter. The interest rate was still from 15% to 18%.

Foreign currencies were stable. There were still no transactions at the official price of the US dollar. The black market was around 4,150 yuan to 4,200 yuan. It was calm and unchanged in the afternoon. As a result, compared to last Saturday, it was slightly more stable. Although the Hong Kong market was prosperous, due to silver funds in this city, the supply was more abundant. Yesterday, the market struggled between 780 yuan and 790 yuan. As a result, it fell by 10 yuan compared to last Saturday. The Hong Kong exchange rate was 880 yuan to 900 yuan. The Indian exchange rate was 1,060 yuan to 1,080 yuan. The British exchange rate was 14,200 yuan to 14,300 yuan. The US exchange rate remained unchanged.

### Philippine Ship Delivers Lumber, Customs Procedures Not Completed

[Our Report] The Philippine ship "Stanheholt" chartered by Warren Foreign Company, arrived in Shanghai on the 20th carrying 750,000 feet of lumber from the US and Australia. It was moored at buoys number seven and eight on the South Huangpu River. Because the Philippine ship arrived in Shanghai and the customs procedures were not completed, the customs did not accept the import. The company has sent a letter to the US consulate, which has been forwarded to the embassy, to request a temporary solution from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Therefore, the lumber can only be unloaded after the foreign affairs procedures are completed. The lumber is handled by China and Company.

### Cement Industry: Request for Increased Import Tax Rejected by Ministry of Finance

The Chinese Cement Industry Federation, previously concerned about the massive influx of foreign cement that gravely threatened domestic manufacturers, submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance two months ago to increase cement import tariffs to curb dumping. It is now learned that the Ministry of Finance has responded to Shanghai, stating that the current cement import tariff, set at 40% ad valorem, is already not low. The Federation is greatly alarmed and recently submitted another request to the Ministry of Finance, thoroughly and urgently pointing out the necessity of revising the cement import tariff from various factual and legal perspectives, and firmly urging the government to make a prompt decision and implement it immediately, otherwise this national industry, which has consistently achieved success, will inevitably go bankrupt. It is heard that the Federation also held an emergency board meeting the night before last to discuss further countermeasures.

### Priority for Textile Machinery: British Representative Expresses Sympathy; Australian Wool Not Shipped to Japan

[Our Dispatch] Deputy Director Zhang of the China Textile Corporation has returned to Shanghai after completing his trip abroad. When asked by reporters about the negotiations with British textile industry representatives in Beijing, he replied: In terms of textile equipment, he had earnestly explained to the British representatives that China's goal was to restore the pre-war figure of five million spindles, which was only to make up for losses and not to expand; he hoped that Britain could deeply understand this point and give China priority when purchasing textile machinery. Currently, Britain must consider its own needs while exporting textile machinery to creditor nations, making it difficult for China to order machinery from Britain. This negotiation took the most time but ultimately gained the sympathy of the British representatives and achieved a satisfactory result. Regarding raw materials, since almost all Australian wool is shipped to Britain, China requested to be allocated a portion. Recent reports stated that Australia would export a large amount of wool to Japan to revive Japan's wool textile industry. When specifically inquired with the British representatives, it was learned that this was not true. As for the British textile industry, it is currently undergoing a process of modernization. However, because most factories were established too long ago, the facilities are older, and the welfare is worse, British workers are generally unwilling to work in textile factories, which is a major obstacle to the development of the British cotton textile industry.

[British Information Service, London, 21st] In order to restore Britain's leading position in the world's textile machinery, there is currently an important new development in Britain. All major cotton yarn mills in Britain have decided to establish a permanent research institute as soon as possible to review and compare the latest machinery production methods and cotton fabrics. A new machinery factory near Bolton, Lancashire, has used new methods to produce yarn, which is one and a half times faster than the old method. This industry is one of the oldest in British history, established in the 16th century and modernized in the 18th century. However, by the 20th century, its new textile machinery was more outdated than the equipment of new industries abroad, so the British government appointed a working group, which emphasized in its report in May this year that existing equipment should be replaced with modern machinery. Currently, textile machinery produced in Britain accounts for 75% of the total being shipped abroad.

### Local Red Tea Market Active: Jardine Matheson & Co. to Resume Business

The Taiwan-style fine red tea imitated by local tea factories is still popular with Jardine Matheson & Co., and the selling price is also quite high. If the suppliers can reduce the price, trading firms like the Indian Yule Catto & Co. will continue to purchase it. Among other teas, newly produced Wenzhou tea is still selling the most smoothly. Although exporters are also interested in high-quality old tea, it is scarce and difficult to choose for the time being, so the market remains quiet. It is also heard that French merchant house Ewo, after its foreign manager flew to Shanghai last week, is currently actively planning to resume business, making smooth progress, and plans to start trading soon. Export of old tea has been active in recent months. Because of the lower cost, it is also quite profitable, but due to inconsistent quality, problems occur from time to time, causing difficulties for exporters. It is recently heard that the United States and France have banned the import of this old tea, with only a small amount still being shipped to India.

### Significant Progress in Processing Methods for Exported Leather Goods

In recent years, the processing and packaging of China's exported leather goods have greatly improved. In the past, leather hides were of uneven sizes, and the cleaning process often failed to remove all dirt. This drawback has now been reformed so that foreign importers only need to dye the leather after import to make exquisite and luxurious clothing. According to people in the industry, China can also complete the dyeing process. However, because the international market charges a 65% import tax on finished products, while undyed leather is treated as raw material and only taxed at 12.5%, China's leather goods are still exported undyed.

### Three New Ships Arrive in China; Over Ten More to Arrive Next Year: Minsheng Company Striving to Recover

[Our Dispatch] Minsheng Company recently purchased three new ships in the United States, which will sail to China in the near future and operate along the coast. The company has also ordered over ten riverboats in Canada, which will return to China in two batches next year. These new ships are all powered by steam turbines, with exceptionally high speeds, which will greatly facilitate Yangtze River shipping.

### Control of Woolen Yarn: Raw Materials and Dyes Uncontrollable; Finished Products Also Impossible to Fully Control; Requesting Government to Negotiate for Undelivered Machinery

[Our Dispatch] The price of woolen yarn has risen sharply in the past month, and the municipal government is trying to suppress it, hence the price negotiation. According to the persons in charge of the two industry associations, there are three reasons for the price increase: (1) After the exchange rate adjustment, prices of everything have risen, and woolen yarn is no exception. (2) When prices are rising sharply, other industries are also hoarding woolen yarn to preserve the value of their money, which causes the price to rise. (3) During this period, some woolen yarn factories have stopped production due to boiler damage, and several factories have stopped production due to electricity problems, which has reduced the market supply. However, today, the rising trend has passed, and prices have started to fall due to the weak purchasing power of ordinary citizens. As for the government's desire to control the woolen yarn industry, there are obvious difficulties because the supply of raw materials and dyes is controlled by foreigners, and there is a black market due to the difficulty of purchasing them. This is one difficulty. At the same time, the association cannot purchase all the products of each factory, so the implementation of control cannot have an absolute effect. This is another difficulty. As for the source of raw materials, they come from countries such as Australia, Britain, and the United States, but these countries are all in the process of industrial recovery, and wool is under control, making it difficult to export. The general export method is for merchants in those countries to ship it to Belgium, and then transship it to China. However, today, this method is becoming increasingly impractical because Belgium also needs wool for its own use. The main sales market for woolen yarn in this city is the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and a small amount is also shipped to the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. The woolen yarn industry has two specific hopes for the government: (1) The wool textile machinery ordered in Britain was originally scheduled for delivery in three years, which is too long. It is hoped that with the government's intervention, the goods can be received sooner. (2) It is hoped that with the government's assistance, a large supply of high-quality wool from various countries can be obtained.

### Australian Scarves Arrive in Shanghai

As the cold winter approaches, woolen scarves are a necessary item for keeping warm. Yi He Zhuang at No. 45 Xingchang Lane, Middle Henan Road, Shanghai, has specially purchased a large number of pure wool scarves from Australia, which have now arrived in Shanghai. The colors and quality are excellent.

### Rayon: Allocation Incomplete with Colors and Sizes; Market Still Difficult to Stabilize

[Our Dispatch] Yesterday, the No. 120 bright rayon on the overpass still traded at the original price of 3.45 million yuan from last weekend, with few transactions. The No. 120 semi-bright was only traded at 2.9 million yuan in the morning, and in the afternoon, someone collected it, and the price was raised by another 150,000 yuan. The No. 75 semi-bright was also more than 100,000 yuan higher than last week. The No. 150 bright is scarce on the market, with demand exceeding supply. Yesterday, the price suddenly rose by more than 300,000 yuan. According to people in the silk weaving industry, it is hoped that when the Central Trust Bureau purchases rayon from Japan, all sizes must be complete, and bright, semi-bright, and matte must be matched, so that it can meet the actual needs of each factory. Otherwise, this rise and fall will never be completely suppressed. The factory warp market is mediocre. Yesterday, the 78-point D-grade was traded by Indian merchants in more than ten packages, priced at 2.65 million yuan, with no change from the asking price last weekend. Silk fabrics are still depressed, and the market is sluggish. Huajin crepe is asking for 3.1 million yuan, but there are very few transactions.

### Central Trust Bureau Continues Allocation

Furthermore, yesterday the Central Trust Bureau allocated less than 200 boxes of rayon, with a total of 128 applicants. The allocation price was the same as the previous time. Today's black market still reached 3.3 million yuan, and at one point in the afternoon, it was as high as 3.5 million yuan. People in the silk weaving industry believe that the listed price is slightly too high, which led to this. The delivery orders for the previous allocation have been received by the association, and members can go and collect them. For those applying for allocation from other areas, in addition to Hangzhou, which has been determined to receive 200 boxes, Suzhou has been determined to receive 20 boxes this month and will increase to 80 boxes next month. It is said that Shengze has not been determined because no one has come to take over the matter.

### Both Bean and Rice Markets Weak; Vegetable Oil and Wheat Strong

Yesterday, the registration of customers and goods in the rice market in the north and south totaled more than 9,000 shi. The market was sluggish. Medium and low-grade japonica rice fell by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, indica rice was weak by 300 to 500 yuan to 1,000 yuan, and white yuan and yin yuan fell sharply by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Shantou's rice from Zhejiang moved slightly. Vegetable oil was weak in the morning and tight in the afternoon, showing a slight strength. Sesame oil was flat. Both Shantou qingwu wheat were inquired about and continued to rise by 1,000 yuan. Guangbang yellow hemp moved slightly, rising by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Raw peanuts had an excess of supply and demand, falling sharply by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Northeast soybeans arrived in large quantities, falling sharply by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Broad beans followed suit, falling by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Red sorghum followed down by 2,000 yuan. Green beans fell by another 1,000 yuan. Bean cake fell by 400 to 500 yuan. Red beans were weak, falling by 5,000 to 6,000 yuan.

### Exports of White Tung Oil Quiet; Domestic Sales of Hongjiang Tung Oil Also Slow

A week ago, the price of white tung oil in Yingcheng suddenly surged, reportedly due to Guangdong merchants mobilizing to export it through Hong Kong, settling foreign exchange at black market rates. Unexpectedly, this was only a one-time transaction and could not be continued. Currently, because the new oil is about to be produced and the remaining old oil is very little, the production price has been telegraphed to increase repeatedly. However, after being shipped to Shanghai, it still requires an additional 120,000 yuan per dan, while selling it for export only fetches slightly over 110,000 yuan, making the traders helpless. There is almost no one in this city talking about exporting, but vegetable oil factories may have some transactions or still be profitable, which is not known to outsiders. Domestic sales have reached 125,000 yuan per dan, but sales are extremely small and only for decoration.

Hongjiang tung oil is not in season for domestic sales, but as the price of white tung oil rises, the cost naturally increases, and it has to be slightly increased as well. Each branded barrel is sold for 92,000 to 93,000 yuan, with few sales. Very few people pay attention to market fluctuations.

### Production Statistics

[Central News Agency, Washington, 20th, United Press] The US Department of Agriculture recently stated that China's tung oil production from 1938 to 1946 averaged 132,000 US tons per year (2,000 pounds per ton), while from 1935 to 1937, it averaged 150,000 US tons per year. However, it is expected that annual production will reach 200,000 tons in the next few years.

### Flour Mills Apply to Order US Wheat; Low-Price Flour Continues to Be Sold

In addition, the low-price flour jointly operated by five flour mills, Fuxin, Feng, Maoxin, Yutong, and Huaxing, in this city is still being sold, with a price of 13,900 yuan per bag.

### Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs Sells Products from Reopened Factories

[This City Dispatch] The enemy and puppet factories taken over by the Ministry of Economic Affairs were previously commissioned by the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau to restart production in larger factories for which a disposal method could not be immediately decided, in order to provide relief to unemployed workers. Now that the office is being ordered to close down, all the products from reopened factories, totaling over 70 types, including various light and heavy leathers, rubber products, paints, inks, bakelite products, alcohol, calcium carbonate, etc., are being sold at the office at No. 121 Jiangxi Road. It is heard that the general prices are lower than market prices. Factories, merchants, organizations, and groups in this city can apply, and the procedures are relatively simple.

### Business News Summary

### Duck Feather Price Over 100,000

Duck feather production has reached its peak season.

In addition, the counties in northern Jiangsu produce a large amount of feathers, but due to the war, transportation is difficult, and there is no hope of shipping them out for the time being.

### Difficulty in Developing Sales of Sichuan Medicinal Herbs; Export Volume Only One-Tenth of Pre-War Level

Sichuan medicinal herbs have a long-standing reputation. The sales market is wide, extending not only throughout the country but also to Europe, America, Southeast Asia, and Annam, making it a major export of Sichuan Province. The most famous include rhubarb, turmeric, angelica, chuanxiong, fritillary bulbs, cordyceps, codonopsis, etc. Before the war, the export volume was estimated at 6,000 tons of rhubarb, 1,500 tons of angelica, and less chuanxiong, but still over 500 tons. During the war, exports almost came to a complete standstill. In the year since the victory, the export volume has been less than one-tenth of pre-war levels. Currently, the export of local medicinal herbs is limited to a few places such as Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuhan, Hong Kong, and Guangzhou, and the quantity is limited. The reasons are: first, traffic is blocked and transportation is difficult, increasing costs; second, each trade guild in the industry has an old-fashioned organization with limited capital; third, the overseas market has not recovered commercially after the war, and purchasing power is also weak. Remittances from overseas Chinese are also restricted by local governments, making it difficult to remit funds back for free purchases in large quantities. For example, a batch of rhubarb shipped from Chongqing to Australia and then transshipped overseas a few months ago, totaling 150,000 jin and valued at 300 million yuan, is still frozen in Guangzhou due to difficulties in foreign exchange settlement. Fourth, production has decreased. Recently, the British and American consulates have sent a large number of orders, intending to purchase at high prices, but they require immediate delivery of the goods with immediate payment in Shanghai, and the quantity must be at least 50 tons. The industry lacks a large amount of inventory and does not dare to accept the orders.

In the first half, Chunsheng led by a narrow margin of 32 to 30, only ahead by two points. According to airline sources, there will definitely be a plane this morning to carry the athletes back south.

Exquisite, Clear, and Beautiful

The exquisite, clear, and beautiful performances by both teams last night were unprecedented in recent times. Their agility and accurate shooting drew endless praise from the thousands of spectators, who were greatly pleased. This was a stark contrast to the lackluster performance of the previous night. Chunsheng's victory did not come easily. Zhenglun took the lead five times in the first quarter and twice more in the second quarter. In the third quarter, they even led by as much as six points at 44 to 38, but unfortunately, they couldn't maintain it. Both teams had similar styles, making the match highly engaging. Zhenglun's rapid progress indicates a promising future.

Zhenglun Takes an Early Lead

With both teams lined up, Zhenglun dribbled the ball forward. In a flash, Ji Zhongqiang made a layup under the basket, opening the scoring. Chunsheng's Cai Wenzhang and Chen Jin followed up with successful shots, taking the lead at 4 to 2. Zhenglun's Tu Wenlong scored with a long shot, taking the lead again at 7 to 5. Chunsheng's Jin Zhi retaliated, tying the score again. Zhang Yuyi replaced Yang Wenhui, but Tu Wenlong scored again from the sideline, marking Zhenglun's third lead. The score fluctuated, creating intense excitement: 13 to 12, 15 to 14. In the end, Zhenglun led by one point in the first quarter.

In the second quarter, Chunsheng gradually started to gain momentum: 19 to 17. Yang Wenhui scored again, tying the score at 19, then 21, and 23, resulting in several ties. Zhenglun then took the lead again at 26 to 23 and 28 to 26. However, Chunsheng scored three consecutive baskets, ending the first half with a score of 32 to 30, giving Chunsheng the lead.

Chunsheng's Superior Strategy

The second half unfolded in an extremely tense atmosphere. Zhenglun did not show any weakness and gradually advanced amidst cheers, eventually taking the lead at 44 to 38. Chunsheng launched a spirited counterattack, surpassing Zhenglun in the third quarter at 47 to 46. At that moment, the tense atmosphere in the entire stadium was filled with shouts and cheers. In the final quarter, Jin De showed off his skills, and Chunsheng's superior strategy gradually gained the upper hand. Zhenglun's Wang Binghuan was ejected after committing his fifth foul. The final score was 63 to 53, with Chunsheng emerging victorious, much to everyone's delight. Although Zhenglun lost, they still earned honor.

### Promoting Domestic Goods and Boosting Production

— Mao Qingxiang

From the eight years of arduous War of Resistance, every Chinese person has learned one lesson, that is, if our China wants to stand in the world in the future and no longer be subjected to foreign aggression, it must actively complete the work of national modernization. To complete the construction of a modernized country, we need democratic unity in politics and promotion of production in economics. Without either, a new modernized China cannot be built.

Currently, all the people of China are calling for political unity and democracy, but the economic construction aspect has been somewhat overlooked. Everyone only knows that rising prices, shrinking production, and the dumping of foreign goods are putting the national economy and the people's livelihood into an extremely painful and extremely dangerous situation, but they do not know that the main reason for rising prices, shrinking production, and the dumping of foreign goods is that our production is too backward! Because of backward production, our production costs are high, so how can prices not rise? After prices rise, the people's purchasing power is weakened, so how can production not shrink? With shrinking production, the supply of many goods falls short of demand, so how can foreign goods not take the opportunity to dump on our markets? Therefore, the fundamental cause of the hardship of the Chinese people today is backward production. Backward production has led to the dumping of foreign goods, and the dumping of foreign goods has naturally led to the national economy and the people's livelihood bordering on bankruptcy. Therefore, to save the current economic crisis of the country and the people, political unity and democracy are extremely important, but promoting production and completing the construction of modernized production are equally important.

The task of the China Production Promotion Association is to assist producers in improving production and to solve the current difficulties for producers in distress, so that the young Chinese industry has the opportunity to develop and the economic construction of the entire country can gradually embark on the road to modernization. Because we know that only in this way can we fundamentally save China's economic crisis and fundamentally eliminate the poverty and suffering of the Chinese people.

Therefore, promoting production is a century-long plan to rescue the national economy and the people's livelihood, which are on the verge of collapse, and it is also the most fundamental method. However, the promotion and completion of this fundamental method is by no means something that can be achieved overnight. However, looking around at the current situation of China's dilapidated production, everyone knows that in addition to treating the root cause, it is necessary to treat the symptoms at the same time in order to save this emergency situation that is placed before each of us. The way to treat the symptoms is to promote domestic goods. If, under the current circumstances, our poor Chinese compatriots still do not understand the severity of industrial bankruptcy and production stagnation, and are unwilling to endure temporary pain to promote domestic goods, then when the production of our own Chinese affairs tends to complete collapse, the pain at that time may be more than just rising prices.

Perhaps some people have long doubted the practical effect of this movement to promote domestic goods, because in the past 20 years or so, China has had movements to promote domestic goods almost every year, but until now, domestic goods have not been successfully promoted. The reason for this is, on the one hand, that the eight-year War of Resistance destroyed the cause of domestic goods production, and now it has to start all over again. On the other hand, after promoting domestic goods, it must be followed by promoting production. If we only know how to promote domestic goods and do not know how to promote production, the cause of domestic goods production will remain stagnant and unable to move forward, seeking progress from improving products, reducing costs, and so on, then the result of promoting domestic goods will inevitably remain equal to zero. The shortcomings of past movements to promote domestic goods cannot be said to be here, so our promotion of domestic goods today, holding exhibitions of domestic goods, is not simply to find sales channels for domestic goods manufacturers, but to use the promotion of domestic goods as a means to promote production and build modern industry. This is a basic strategy to save the national economy and the people's livelihood, and it is also an important step in building a modern country.

### National Goods Exhibition and the Promotion of National Products Movement

— Yang Yinpu

We raised the slogan of "Promoting National Products" at least forty years ago. In the past, more than forty years ago, we started the national product promotion movement, and today, more than forty years later, we are still continuing this movement, and it seems that there has not been much progress in practice. The crisis of national products is only getting more and more serious. As a citizen, it is natural to promote national products. However, what we called promotion in the past focused on the consumer public, containing the meaning of auxiliary protection by everyone. Even though national products are not better in quality or cheaper in price than foreign products, as citizens, we should uphold the meaning of promoting national products, embrace the spirit of sacrifice, not use foreign products, and still use national products.

This movement to promote national products by requiring everyone's sacrifice has two major shortcomings: first, it is not easy to be universal; second, it cannot be sustained. Because buying good goods and buying cheap goods is a very natural desire of the general public. National products are not necessarily the best or the cheapest, and we need to sacrifice to buy them and use them. No matter what, we will not truly get the cooperation of the entire public. Therefore, it is said that this movement will not be universal. Even if we take a step back and say that the public can truly embrace the spirit of sacrifice to promote national products, the assistance that the production sector can expect from the public is at most temporary. In the early immature stage of industry, people need help, and people can understand and sympathize; however, after a considerable period of help, if it still cannot gradually grow as expected, people's love and protection will not be easily maintained. Therefore, it is said that this movement cannot be sustained.

The mistake of the past national product promotion movement was that it focused solely on the consumer public, while neglecting the production sector itself. It seems that every member of the public should embrace the spirit of promoting national products to purchase and use national products, while the production sector does not need to embrace the spirit of promoting national products to produce national products. The public is always the main body driving this movement, an active actor; the national product sector is always an object being pushed, a passive actor.

The establishment of this local national product exhibition market must be said to be an important step for the production sector to strive for the initiative. Waiting for customers to come to the door themselves is passive from the perspective of the store; now, with careful planning and centralized exhibitions, it has the effect of making customers have to come, and customers become passive, and the market has gained the initiative. Therefore, it is said that this move by the production sector is an important step in striving for the initiative. However, only with national products can there be exhibitions. This method, which has gained the initiative in the promotion of national products, still has to be implemented on the other hand – which is also a more fundamental aspect. This other aspect is the production of national products.

Therefore, taking advantage of this national product exhibition opportunity, which contains an active role, we should promote a national product promotion movement in the production sector. We must know that only when the production sector can embrace the spirit of promoting national products to produce national products can it gradually strive for a dominant position.

In the past, under the sentiment of the public promoting national products, a part of the production sector unconsciously developed a kind of dependence mentality, as if they always felt that success or failure was in the hands of others; unconsciously formed a kind of inferiority complex, as if they always felt that their foundation was too weak and could never compete with foreign products. In the past, the crude and simple equipment and the short-sighted policy of our country's production sector cannot be said to have been influenced by this mentality to some extent.

This psychological illusion should be corrected immediately. Producing national products is not only for the sake of personal short-term interests, but also bears the mission of promoting national products. That is to say, to gradually establish the position of national products so that foreign products have no way to intervene is the true promotion of national products. If we only work hard on the public side, even if we are completely successful, we will only do half of it at most. The other half, which is also the more important half, should be borne by the production sector itself. The production sector should fully cultivate the spirit of independent struggle, knowing that relying on the promotion of the public is unreliable; they should have full confidence and belief, knowing that as long as they can work hard, as long as their direction of efforts is correct, the position of national products can definitely be established, and competing with foreign products is not a problem.

The final goal of the production sector's efforts is naturally to have "cheap and good" products. Even if they cannot be cheaper than others or better than others, they must be as cheap as others and as good as others. As a last resort, they must at least be not much more expensive than others and not much worse than others. In this way, coupled with the exhibition-style promotion with active meaning, coupled with the public's promotion sentiment, the position of national products can naturally be consolidated.

If the production sector wants to achieve the goal of "cheap and good" products, there is naturally a direction to take. At present, production is subject to various environmental constraints. To immediately develop in a normal way, there will naturally be thousands of threads and many difficulties. However, from our point of view, whether it is the problem of mechanical equipment, the problem of raw materials, the problem of technology, the problem of power, the problem of workers, etc., although each is a difficult problem at present, there are still ways to solve them. I am afraid that the most difficult to solve, and the most needed to be solved, is the basic problem of management and personnel. If we want to produce excellent products and reduce costs, I am afraid that we must thoroughly reform management and personnel. Lack of organizational ability has always been the biggest shortcoming in all aspects and departments of our country, and the production sector is no exception. Only after management is scientific and personnel can be rationalized can our production sector have a bright future, and our national products can have a real way out.

Therefore, on this day when the national product exhibition has been realized in this city, we hope that the production sector can go a step further, broaden their horizons, and express their spirit of promoting national products in terms of production efficiency. (October 18, 1946)

### The Voice of National Products

Wang Xiaolai said:

When buying things, everyone is used to saying buying "things," "Dong" means Eastern goods, and Xi means Western goods. In this way, we forget about our own national products. Now Western goods are coming in a steady stream, and Eastern goods are also trying to change their appearance and promote them in my city's market. Please pay attention!

Women and Family Published Every Tuesday

### Secrets of Marriage

— Yan Juan

Marriage is Beneficial

Marriage is an extremely important matter for life, and it is extremely suitable for natural conditions. This can be fully proven by simply looking at the difference in health between married and unmarried people.

According to statistics, married people, especially men, have a much lower mortality rate than unmarried people of the same age. This proves that marriage is beneficial to health. But what is the reason? It differs for men and women.

In the case of women, after marriage, her experiences are not as abrupt as those of unmarried women. She can be freed from the fierce competition for survival, and both her mind and body are more stable and easygoing. In other aspects, after a woman develops to maturity, she needs to fulfill her natural duty of reproduction. If she does not engage in reproduction, it will be detrimental to her health.

In the case of men, the family can restore his fatigue, and a good wife can give him rest and comfort. This kind of effect is greater than that of a panacea. People without spouses cannot get this kind of comfort. A dry and tasteless family makes his tired body and mind even more tired. Unmarried men often stay up late at night, borrowing wine to relieve their sorrows, so they have many opportunities to suffer from neurasthenia or venereal diseases, which are harmful to their health and not insignificant.

Age of Husband and Wife

For marriage, the mental and physical health of both men and women is the first condition, so the age difference should not be too large. At present, some people practice early marriage, which is not very appropriate. Some old men marry young women; some middle-aged women fall in love with young men. This situation is even worse. Because old people who marry young wives and concubines have to find ways to win her favor, so they pretend to be energetic, and the result will inevitably be excessive labor, leading to premature aging, affecting health, and nothing can be added. In the case of young wives and concubines, although she will not be harmed, the result will inevitably be various problems due to sexual dissatisfaction. The result is the same between older unmarried women and younger men. Therefore, if the age of the husband and wife is too far apart, the family is prone to cracks, not only cracks in sexual life, but also cracks in health and cracks in life.

Men and women can only marry after their mind and body are mature. The age of maturity is probably 25 to 30 years old for men and 20 to 25 years old for women. It is naturally very appropriate to marry during this period, but under the current social conditions, due to the limitations of economic conditions, men mostly marry around the age of 30, but if women reach the age of 30, the body's tissues begin to harden, and childbirth is also more difficult, so they cannot marry too late, preferably around the age of 23 or 24. As for the age difference between husband and wife, it is generally 3 to 10 years, and it is not good to exceed it too much.

Attention to the First Night

Sexual behavior should be very cautious on the night of the wedding. In old-fashioned weddings, the "entering the bed" matter was considered very important. The matchmaker's responsibility could only be lifted after that night. Married people generally anticipate the situation of the first night. On the bride's side, although she tries her best to avoid getting married during her menstrual period, there are also various exceptions, such as the sudden onset of menstruation or other unfavorable events. Therefore, if you are anxious for sexual behavior for the first time, it may cause fear in the bride, or be frightened by bleeding. Under such circumstances, the shadows of unhappiness, revulsion, and fear will remain and become the cause of anesthesia.

As for the honeymoon trip after marriage, it is also worth considering. Because newlyweds are prone to excessive physical and mental fatigue, and their spirits must be unstable, if you add the hard work of traveling and the troubles of lodging, the nerves cannot be quiet, which is not suitable for health.

### The Current Tasks of Chinese Women

— Yu Renfeng

The world has changed from the matrilineal era to the patriarchal era, and it has been more than thousands of years since then. During this long period, women were locked in the dark prison—the family—living a very painful life of cattle and horses. It was not until after capitalism was produced in response to social needs that a small number of women were slowly liberated from imprisonment. But this is by no means the prosperity of women, it has its economic reasons. However, upon careful examination and review, are women now truly liberated? Has the entire women's world passed the prison-style family? Facts tell us that the result of the development of capitalism has made them have to regard family work as a must, and run to the factory to work, but they still cannot escape family chores and troubles, and suffer from the oppression and exploitation of the factory owners and capitalists. The painful situation is really beyond description. Of course, there are still some educated women who have been liberated from that kind of bondage, but they are often the vases of institutions and the playthings of landlords and capitalists. If we say that they have truly gained the status of being human, in the women's world, there are really only a minority of the minority.

Since women are subjected to heavy oppression, there are phenomena of their painful groans everywhere in society. Especially in China under the feudal ethics, they are restrained within the scope of the three obediences and four virtues, living a slave-like life. At the same time, because knowledge is self-enclosed, they cannot be given a sense and understanding of their interests, and they only know how to blame the heavens and obey fate. For example, the tragic news that often appears in newspapers about women committing suicide by taking poison, and young girls committing suicide...etc., nineteen out of ten are inseparable from the persecution of the environment. What is advocating freedom and equality is basically an extremely difficult movement to realize. Although there are many organizations of unmarried women's associations in today's cities, they are half empty names and do not engage in practical signboards.

Everyone knows that the organization of women's associations is their group, requiring social status and power. But in fact, it is manipulated by the so-called modern noble ladies and rich young ladies or a part of the intellectual class in the city. Of course, these enthusiastic (?) women have shouldered great liberation goals and responsibilities, but the result is difficult to have real value. Because women's liberation is fundamentally not based solely on the formal shouts and actions of a small number of upper-class women. In other words, all women must receive considerable education.

Since Chinese women are not yet liberated, they should not only demand equal status, but should also take on the responsibility for the prosperity and decline of the entire country's wealth in advance, that is, they must change their own extravagant ideas. Now the alarming import of cosmetics in China, the outflow of money is worrying, it is the responsibility of women, which cannot be concealed by nice-sounding slogans. For example, vocational sports, rather than hoping that the backbone of urban women's associations and the intellectual class will implement it, it is better to downgrade and promote it to the countryside. In good conscience, we can also observe their simple life and reduce some of our own foreign atmosphere in the city. You should know that constantly applying makeup is definitely not liberation, wearing a Parisian hat, wearing high heels, wearing high heels is not an equal performance.

### A Collection of Common Sense About Women and Infants

— Yu Feng

The following points are not baseless rumors, but facts that have been verified by the American Medical Association:

(1) The ratio of male infants to female infants produced during wartime is often higher than usual. Correct. The proportion of male infants to female infants born in each war is above 115 to 100.

(2) Healthy mothers often give birth to boys. Incorrect. The personality of the parents does not have a significant impact on the gender of the baby.

(3) Whether or not an unmarried woman is pregnant can be detected in the first ten days. Correct. Using the Aschhein-Zondek test, it is possible to definitively detect a woman's pregnancy or not. Because the excretions of pregnant women contain a large amount of salivary gland hormone. Injecting these hormones into mice makes their egg cells mature particularly quickly. By surgically dissecting and testing the ovaries of mice, the woman's conception or not can be detected.

(4) It is very dangerous for unmarried women who are too young or too old to give birth. Correct. Women who are under 20 or over 35 years of age have a higher mortality rate for their babies and mothers. It is safer between the ages of 20 and 35.

(5) Newborn male infants are often more delicate than female infants, and their mortality rate is also higher. □ Correct. In the first year, the number of deaths of male infants exceeds that of female infants by one-fifth.

(6) The size of the baby depends on the amount of food eaten by the mother during pregnancy. Incorrect. Recent medical opinion is that the mother's food intake does not directly affect the size of the baby at birth.

(7) It is more difficult to give birth to a male infant than to a female infant. Correct. Male infants are often larger than female infants, so they are more difficult to give birth, but not because of gender.

(8) Pregnant women should eat food for two people. Incorrect. Eating too much will increase weight, and being overweight can easily cause blood poisoning.

(9) Most cases of infertility after marriage can be cured. Correct. In recent years, the medical community has made great progress in the treatment of infertility.

(10) Fewer men suffer from infertility than women. Correct. Men with infertility account for 30% to 50% of the total.

(11) Although abortion is illegal, it is safer than childbirth. Incorrect. The mortality rate of abortion is more than ten times higher than that of normal childbirth.

(12) Older women are more likely to have twins than younger women. Correct. The greatest chance of having twins is for women over the age of 35. White-skinned women have more chances of having twins than brown-skinned women.

(13) The gender of the baby is determined at the time of conception. Correct. There are two types of male sperm, one that produces boys and one that produces girls. The determination of the baby's gender depends entirely on which sperm combines with the egg.

(14) Babies born to strong couples are often smarter than those born to young couples. Incorrect. The influence of parents on babies is after birth, not "prenatal education."

(15) It is easier to raise a baby born every year than a baby born every few years. Incorrect. When the two production periods are less than two years apart, the mortality rate is one and a half times that of having a child every few years.

Spring and Autumn

### About Toys

— Zhou Xuliang

One of Random Memories of a Trip to Sichuan

More than a month before the Lunar New Year, toys for children are already visible everywhere in Chengdu. Some are sold on the streets by vendors carrying them on poles, while others are displayed in front of shops. These shops, which normally sell other things, have all transformed into toy shops. The prices are very cheap. Pinwheels, drums, and clackers sell for only two hundred cash, which is less than one fen in legal tender. Ghost masks sell for six hundred or eight hundred cash. I haven’t bought small knives, small guns, trumpets, or toy drums, but I imagine they wouldn't be expensive either. Someone with a bit of silliness could spend half a dollar and fill a cloth bag, go to the homes of relatives and friends with children, and play Santa Claus, bringing much joy. Parents walking down the street with their children can easily take out money and buy one or two items to satisfy them. For adults, it’s barely spending any money, but I dare say that the joy children get from these toys is no different from getting a small car or a foreign doll.

I have traveled to many cities, but I have never seen one like Chengdu, where toys are abundant, cheap, and available so early. In this respect, the children of Chengdu are fortunate. Elsewhere, many things that children can play with are only widely available at the end of the year, and the prices are never so cheap. In larger cities, imported toys, whether from Japan or the West, have shockingly high prices. How many times have parents stood in front of the glass counters of department stores, pondering while their children clamor for them, calculating how to squeeze out the expense from the budget for firewood, rice, oil, salt, socializing, and their own entertainment! I myself have lingered in front of these glass counters—even though I wasn’t a father or married at the time—comparing this price and that price, while also trying to decide whether a ball, a train, or a small machine gun would be the most impressive and bring the most joy to a child. What is both infuriating and amusing is that in those cities with department stores, only these Japanese or Western goods are considered toys, or at least, gifts for children. If you give a child of a relative or friend a paper ball or a small drum, it’s like giving them a peanut. The child's parents will not only not be grateful but may even think you are looking down on their child and them. As a result, the children themselves suffer; they get fewer toys than they should and could. Socializing with children is unnecessary in the first place; if it's hard to please, it's better not to socialize at all.

This mistake, I think, is that parents are too quick to judge their children with their own minds and adult minds. We always buy things we like for our children, thinking that they will like them too. The Japanese or Western goods that we buy for children are often things that we want to play with ourselves. We see a small car running on the table, turning when it reaches the edge, and we are happy to watch it, so we buy it for our children. We see that the clothes of a foreign doll are well-made, like a chorus girl in a movie, and we think it’s beautiful, so we buy it for our children. Owners of Japanese or Western toy companies who understand the psychology of buyers, therefore, rack their brains to create toys that can make adults happy in order to trick them into buying them. Scientific talents with inventive minds and artistic talents with imagination are hired to participate in this trivial creation, making strange and wonderful things in the hope of arousing our scientific amazement and artistic joy. But for children, this is all a waste. Children who get these toys will be like Zhu Bajie eating a ginseng fruit, never chewing it carefully. Even if you say that it contains golden seeds of science and art, they will still see it as a stubborn piece of iron. In less than two days, the small car will be disassembled, and the foreign doll will be thrown into a corner of the room with the ghost mask, collecting dust.

We must never forget that toys are just toys, they cannot be science or art. A child with a sense of curiosity will automatically spend all day in his small car, just like he's exploring the natural phenomena around him, seeking science. A child with an aesthetic sense will also naturally quietly face his doll, the setting sun, and the moonlit night, appreciating beauty. These are unusual cases, and we do not deny that they exist; but the activities of ordinary children are not purely intellectual or purely appreciative. They play with toys because they cannot play with science and art like adults; they play because they want to play. Those toys just help them play. In this regard, a square wooden block is not necessarily less helpful, and a car that doesn't fall off the table is not necessarily more helpful. Children have their own world—a world of play; all they ask of toys is to give this ethereal world a touch of tangible reality, a fulcrum. So just having toys is enough; we don't need to worry about what kind of toys.

Children are inherently full of life. They just can’t be starved. Tonics like shark fin, sea cucumber, and bird’s nest are not needed. Those children who live in big cities are like Tantalus in Greek mythology, watching delicious grapes but unable to eat them. The children of Chengdu do not have so many temptations, but they can get their own simple meals of greens and rice. Easy to break, easy to make, easy to buy—these locally made toys sold on the streets of Chengdu are the only ones that truly belong to the children. For thousands of years, they have pleased our ancestors with their bright red, deep green, bright blue, simple and clear sounds, and simple designs. Now and in the future, they will please our children and grandchildren in the same way, like the spring grass that grows everywhere in Chengdu and in children's homes every year, even before spring arrives.

### A Discussion on Sorrow and Joy

— Shusun Ruying

Sorrow and joy are common human emotions, impossible to force or suppress. Excessive development of sorrow leads to pessimism, while extreme expression of joy leads to optimism. While pessimism is undesirable, unconditional and unreserved optimism is not ideal either. Everyone tends slightly towards optimism or pessimism, but as long as this tendency isn’t too extreme, it should be left to its natural course, without deliberate guidance or suppression.

If one unfortunately experiences the loss of a close relative or friend, wailing and crying for three days is not excessive. If one encounters an old friend in a distant land, shaking hands and rejoicing, laughing loudly for thirty minutes is not inappropriate. Transcending emotions is beyond most people, but moderating emotional confusion, with self-control, is a necessary cultivation for modern people. Being sorrowful without losing ambition, and joyful without losing composure, makes sorrow and joy harmless and beneficial to both body and mind.

Whether sorrow or joy, as long as it’s a normal emotional release, it's not only harmless but also beneficial and necessary. In terms of psychological health, emotional excitement is closely related to the organs within the body. Internal organs, glands, and muscles all respond to emotions. This is a necessary adaptation to stimuli and the only way to appease them. Sorrow and joy arising without cause are pathological; but if sorrow and joy don’t arise when faced with sorrowful or joyful events, that too is pathological. Emotions are like flowing water; smoothing them leads to unobstructed flow, while blocking them leads to devastating floods. Therefore, for mental balance and health, proper release of sorrowful and joyful emotions is indispensable.

One wants to express sorrow and joy fully, but the constraints of reality often prevent it. This is the suffering of people throughout history, and a mental health trap. To relieve this suffering, to transcend this trap, humans seek to create an illusion, in which they can fully express their sorrow and joy. This illusion is artistic creation and appreciation.

Ancient Greece is the source of human art, and the ancient Greeks were the most able to fully express their sorrow and joy. Due to the differences in human character, they created many gods with different characters, and through these gods, expressed their sorrow and joy. Dionysus, the god of wine, is a passionate god who deeply understands human misfortune and suffering. Thus, to worship him, the Greeks created tragedy; and to balance the sad emotions, the Greeks imitated Dionysus' revelry and created comedy. Humans have tragedy and comedy, which evolved into various tragic and comedic arts, thus giving human sorrow and joy more opportunities and places to be fully expressed.

Art is an illusion; therefore, the stimulation it gives to human sorrow and joy is different from real life. Thus, it makes people feel pure emotions that are "sad but not resentful, happy but not excessive," which is of great benefit to human mental health. Furthermore, the inspiration of art gives us a sense of quiet joy. No matter what the sorrow or joy is, as long as you quietly savor the taste of that sorrow and joy, that sorrow and joy will no longer be real sorrow and joy, but will become what Buddhists call "Tathata," so sorrow is no longer sorrow, joy is no longer joy, and you become one with nature, one with the universe, and enter the realm of eternity. This is the sublimation and crystallization of human emotional life.

### When the Sky Clears

— Dai Wangshu

When the sky clears,

We should stroll along the paths:

The mud road, nourished by the rain,

Must be cool and gentle;

The small grass, flaunting its new green,

Has been washed clean of all dirt;

The little white chrysanthemums, no longer timid,

Slowly raise their heads,

Testing the cold, testing the warmth,

Then blossoming fully, one by one;

The butterflies, shaking off the water droplets,

Wander freely among the wooden leaves,

Exposing their ornate, colorful book pages,

Opening and closing them in the sunlight.

Let’s stroll along the paths,

When the sky clears:

Barefoot, hand in hand,

Treading on the new mud, wading through the stream.

The new sun pushes away the haze,

The stream ripples in the warm breeze,

Look at the moving dark green in the mountains—

Footprints—it’s also wandering leisurely.

### Autumn Dream

— ·Zhu Yan·

Autumn dreams are short, fragmented, yet faithful. As long as I close my eyes, my breathing becomes heavy, and the beat of my heart softens, she, like a leaf falling naturally in autumn, gently floats onto the silver screen of my brain and starts to move, never missing an appointment.

She seems to be searching for me everywhere with a lovelorn heart, trying to capture me. She comes from afar, across a vast wilderness, a deep and wide river, and through layers of smoky trenches; because she comes, she often takes me to those places as well. She is also a stubborn nostalgic, leading me to many years gone by; perhaps there are happy enjoyments, perhaps there are bitter reliving.

This statement is not wrong. Autumn dream—this lonely person's graceful demon, is indeed actively searching for me. Lying haphazardly on the bed, she happens to find me. Trying not to put my hand on my chest, she also comes. Even if I learn the sleeping posture of a monk during a period of abstinence, I still cannot reject her.

…On a late autumn evening, on the bank of a river surrounding a manor, a whole row of tall elm trees has already dropped half of its branches and leaves—elm trees are easy to wither; the red-stemmed reed catkins have completely turned white, and the tender yellow leaves are their clothes, arranged like a team on the water's edge. The threshing ground is directly opposite this riverbank with shady trees and white reeds, with a haystack shaped like a high-stacked steamed bun, standing neatly at the corner of the threshing ground, towering above the cliff. A spotted dog is curled up asleep below… As soon as this scene unfolds, my sister, who died many years ago, is talking to me in this quiet threshing ground:

"Brother! I will never go to the × family even if I die! I plan to study and go far away!"

I also say the same sentence forever:

"Rest assured! Get well first, and I will help you to the end!"

A smile appears on her pale face; two lovely red clouds of a consumptive patient appear on her cheeks.

I feel that when I want to say something else, I will naturally wake up! Rubbing my eyes, I think of the solitary yellow earth grave where only a winter holly tree has grown; this, indeed, is her final destination in the second year after she said those words. On the anniversary of her death two years ago, her niece was already worshiping an aunt she did not recognize under that winter holly tree.

Lazily watching the sunlight gradually dimming at the window, I don’t even have the heart to reminisce, fleeting and baseless daytime dream!

If the dream were more complete, or if it were smeared with a little cloud of hope, I would really open my arms to welcome her. But she is fleeting, fragmented, gray and dull, like endless falling autumn leaves, flying in piece by piece, scattering!

### One Inch of Mountain, One Inch of River, One Inch of Blood 69

— Ye Jingfeng

We felt that the work here in Guanfang was very simple and easy. The captain told us that we must launch the anti-Japanese movement at zero hour on the twenty-eighth, or at the latest by three o'clock before dawn, taking the "Security Team" as the main body and the puppet army as the secondary target. The captain ordered me and Tiger Brother to serve as special envoys for liaison with the Security Team. Tiger Brother and I spent only half a day finding a few key people (of course, those in slightly higher positions) and talking to them. Finding acquaintances was Tiger Brother's merit, and speaking was my job. Then we were responsible for two-way negotiations, conveying conditions, procedures, deadlines, etc. The captain and his subordinates had already carried out a lot of liaison work, so we were able to handle things very smoothly.

On the puppet army side, the personnel were too complex, and there was simply no discipline or system. At the same time, Tiger Brother and I knew too few people there. The matter was not so straightforward. We started by establishing a center in the Twelfth Regiment, but the conditions put forward by the leaders were too harsh, or rather, too outrageous. They demanded the general command, even the Security Team had to be under their command. This one was dropped. Secondly, they said that once the revolt was launched, they would have to preside over the administration and search and seize the property of the traitors. In other words, they wanted to rob for a while.

For these two conditions, there were many negotiations, back and forth twists and turns, and countless troubles, but we never reached an agreement. Most of these puppet troops were a rabble, vulgar, hooligans, miscellaneous troops from outside the pass who could not survive, and small groups of mountain bandits, etc.; in short, they were all fourth- and fifth-rate social scum. From this point, I suddenly thought of a person. He was a small group leader among our associates, with extremely wide connections in the underworld. He had some dealings with all kinds of people. He now lived in the Beiping Hotel, serving as a receiver and dispatcher in our organization. If he could spare some time to come here and lead the negotiations, he would surely succeed with his reputation from outside the pass.

I discussed this matter with the captain, and the captain immediately telegraphed the captain of the Beiping headquarters, asking him to send someone to bring that leader to me. The telegram said "Process immediately." That leader was delayed by something and only rushed here last night. After careful discussion, he spent most of the night inviting several key figures from the Twelfth Regiment of the puppet army to hold a secret meeting. As expected, he lived up to my expectations and reconciled the conditions of both sides. Regarding the uprising, suppressing traitors, maintaining order, resolving enemy forces in the city, defense, confronting enemy troops outside the city, liaison with our regular army, and other personnel matters, a list of duties was drawn up. In this way, although the liaison work was largely completed, the time was delayed by several hours. Everyone agreed that it would be launched at five o'clock tomorrow morning. In the hours before the launch, all the arrangements must be made strictly and thoroughly.

At this time, the clock was already pointing to 1:50 AM, that is, 1:50 AM on the 28th, only a few hours away, when the Japanese were about to launch the first act of the formal battle since July 7th—"Dawn Attack." According to intelligence, we knew that the Japanese army stationed outside Tongxian City had already been mobilized and ready around that time, and could open fire as soon as the time came. The most hateful thing was that this Twelfth Regiment of the puppet army caused so much trouble and delayed the time. If we could launch on time at the expected zero hour or three o'clock in the morning, such a major move in the heart of the Japanese would be a very meaningful and valuable action for both our military and political sides. It's just a pity that it's a few hours late!

### Self-Deception

— Shaofu

Humans often have many laughable behaviors, which is to create stories to deceive themselves. This behavior is purposeful, aiming for subconscious satisfaction.

The execution of eleven Nazi war criminals in Nuremberg, under such heavily guarded arrangements, yet Göring managed to commit suicide calmly, avoiding the scene of being hanged, causing the person in charge to still be investigating, this news is stimulating enough, also sensational enough, but people are not satisfied, even saying that those who were hanged were straw men, and ten real criminals have already escaped justice. This legend is not necessarily an attack on leniency or other political conspiracies, but due to a kind of hero worship idea prevailing.

Saying that the Nuremberg hanging was all straw men, and saying that Hitler is still alive is the same idea. In the meantime, there are naturally all kinds of people with speculative motives using people's psychology and adding fuel to the fire, expanding the fabrication.

Whether in China or abroad, in ancient or modern times, there are such stories. In Shanghai, there were rumors about Yan Ruisheng changing his name and how he was doing; and after Water Margin there is Ping Yao Zhuan, after Dream of the Red Chamber there is A Continuation of Dream of the Red Chamber, after Romance of the Three Kingdoms there is Counter-Romance of the Three Kingdoms, the ancients were also like this.

Some also say that this is human nature, pitiful people pitiful actions.

### Old but Strong, White Hair and Rosy Cheeks

— Zheng

This journal published a precious photo on the twentieth: a thirty-nine-year-old groom, Chalai, Biss, with his seventy-seven-year-old bride. This kind of thing is really shocking in the eyes of us Chinese. There are not a few shocking marriages in the world. First, look at the following "old news":

In 1936, there was an old man in Egypt, 130 years old, who was planning to marry a twenty-five-year-old girl. This old man had been married nineteen times, and all his wives had died of illness, leaving him with twenty-three children. These children strongly opposed their father's remarriage, believing that he was over a hundred years old, his physical strength had declined, and there was a difference of one hundred and five years between him and his intended spouse, which was not appropriate, and advised their father to be cautious so as not to regret it later. Unexpectedly, the old man firmly stated: "Although I am old, my health is still good." And he became very angry: "Marriage is my freedom! My children have no right to interfere!"

This old man was not only "not old at heart", but also stubbornly innocent. Such a thing is really hard to come by, because an old man of one hundred and thirty years old is very difficult to find. In the United States, there are quite a few couples with a large age gap. In 1937, a nine-year-old girl in Tennessee, Winsde, actually held a wedding with a six-foot-tall, twenty-two-year-old youth, John, which caused a national uproar, saying it was "barbaric", "terrible", and even "a national disgrace"! Pastors and social activists in Tennessee launched an "opposition movement", and the New York World-Telegram wrote a special commentary: "If we think of them as a group of degenerate mountain people, we will know that culture has not given them much help." But both parents gave permission, and their marriage was considered legal.

In Ohio, a thirteen-year-old girl, Ishan Bohr, married thirty-seven-year-old Henry. The girl's parents were so anxious that they immediately filed a lawsuit with the court, requesting that the marriage be declared invalid.

In Korea, wives are generally ten years older than their husbands. When a boy is born in a family, a ten-year-old child bride is hired for him. When the boy has not yet reached adulthood, the girl is already in a strong state of sexual desire. According to Korean customs, men can marry again and take concubines, while women are absolutely not allowed to remarry or have illicit affairs. Therefore, there are often tragic cases of killing husbands to seek sexual satisfaction.

Unprecedented Record

In 1935, the National News Agency of Belgrade reported: In Romania, a young man named Mania was arrested. Mania was only twenty-eight years old and had married eighty wives in five years, spending US$200,000. After each marriage, he defrauded the women of money and then abandoned them. Marrying eighty wives in five years, averaging almost one bride every twenty days, his method is "great", truly amazing.

A French woman named Ylibaumei married forty-eight men in ten years from the age of eighteen to twenty-eight, and divorced forty-seven times. Among her many husbands, there were lawyers, elementary school teachers, journalists, big businessmen, athletes, petty bureaucrats, doctors, artists, bankers... In terms of nationality, in addition to French, there were Americans, British, Germans, Indians, Japanese, Italians, Arabs, Russians, Turks, Jews, Yugoslavs... Among them, the longest she lived with was her last husband—a construction engineer. The shortest was only three days.

### Songs of a Chaotic World

— Li Huang

The Peasant: Ah, the country bumpkin, born at the wrong time. One "struggle" and all is gone, another "fight" and everything is lost. Though it is said the nation is built on "agriculture," the people live in poverty. "Freedom under the hoe," I ask you, have you really achieved "freedom?"

The Worker: Building a home with bare hands, relying on heaven for sustenance. One "strike" and wages increase, another "strike" and positions rise. Leading with "democracy," pioneers "for the people." The cost of living is only for our benefit. Labor is sacred, sacred labor.

The Merchant: Their hearts are venomous, their hands ruthless, as cunning as foxes, as sharp as tigers. They claim to "take righteousness as profit," but are actually "blinded by money." Handling things with strings attached, their responsibilities are important, manipulating for huge profits, the true nature of these people.

The Student: The grand gate is wide open, no money, no entry. "Learning" has become a "business," abandoning morality and forgetting shame. Between "teacher" and "student," ritual and righteousness are abandoned, and wealth is worshipped. Those with wealth but no learning can buy a diploma, those who study hard and research diligently must still spend money!

The Soldier: (1) Driving jeeps at high speed, pedestrians give way. Embracing beautiful women, heroes love beauty. "Robbing" what is taken, only a one-word mistake, guarding and "stealing" from within, how can benefits leak out? (Above, referring to high-ranking soldiers)

(2) Clothes do not cover the body, skinny and haggard, tying "hand grenades" to charge, brave and unparalleled, facing "machine guns" and sacrificing themselves, becoming cannon fodder. "The success of Yan'an is built on ten thousand bones," working for others. Pitiful bones on the outskirts of Zhangjiakou, all "recruited" common people. (Above, referring to low-ranking soldiers)

The Scholar: The long gown must be worn, losing face is unacceptable, being late for signing in is unacceptable, public affairs are important. The high official "kills" with "currency," the small official is "killed." Those above "command," those below "die."

### Who is the Master?

— Jin Jiaping

When you do something, do you think it is your own voluntary action? No, you are passive. For example, you plan to take a trip. No one has ever suggested it to you. Everything is your own idea. But how did you come up with the idea of traveling? Analyzed, there are the following reasons:

(1) You have a holiday or free time.

(2) You feel bored and need to travel to adjust your mind.

(3) You travel because of your profession.

Regarding the first point, your vacation must of course be approved. You cannot arbitrarily designate a vacation. And even if you have free time, would you be interested or have the opportunity to travel during the rainy season, wartime, or extremely hot weather? Of course you can't or won't. Your motivation is caused by clear or pleasant weather. The reason for the second point of boredom may be because of the monotonous and busy work or something that makes you feel unhappy. For the third point, you are employed and travel. In short, you do something for a reason, and because of this reason you are passive.

The occurrence of anything in the world is due to the chain reaction of movements between things. When we are playing with building blocks, we line up many blocks, leaving a little space in the middle. We only need to press the first block on the second block, then one after another, this row of blocks will all be knocked down. When you are late for class and are questioned by the teacher, your reason is that the tram is too crowded. Isn't this a good example? If the tram were very empty, you wouldn't be late. If you don't trust me, this can be said to be voluntary, but you are still passive, because the idea of not trusting me occurred because you read this text. If I didn't write it, you wouldn't know me at all, and of course there would be no such thing as not trusting me.

Since everything is passive, who is moving it? Who is the active source? We know that the earth is a part of the sun. Its rotation without deviating from its orbit is due to the sun's gravity. Mankind relies on this gravity to grow. That is, human actions are controlled by the sun. But the sun is also one of the planets in the universe, and its movements (scientists have proven that the position of the sun is constantly moving) are also affected by the attraction of other planets. In this infinitely large universe, the movement of each planet responds to other planets. It is impossible for us humans to study the origin of the active in this mysterious and incredible universe. If you are a believer, you can say that everything is controlled by God, but, but what is the origin of God? That is another question.

Local Customs

### It is indeed better to give birth to a son than to a daughter — The region where women are worth the least

— Gan Lai

In some circumstances, women have a very high status. "A smile worth a thousand gold," "A kiss worth a thousand gold," have become beautiful stories that shine through the ages. As long as a woman is not ugly, even in a recession, she will always be more resourceful than a man. Recently, the "Miss Shanghai" election held in this city required one thousand yuan for each vote. The champion with the most votes received a total of 65.5 million yuan, which greatly benefited the refugees, indirectly explaining that the value of women is ultimately beyond what we smelly men can achieve.

However, there is a place where women are regarded as the most lowly and worthless things: girls are buried alive as soon as they are born, or given away as free gifts.

Not a Strange Tale

What is described above is neither a foreign report nor an old custom that has disappeared. It is happening in today's Republic of China:

Xinxing County is a third-class county in Guangdong Province with a population of about 130,000 to 140,000. Its cultural backwardness, stubborn thinking, and peculiar customs have not changed at all to this day.

The deeply rooted concept of valuing men over women makes the women of Xinxing County regarded as animals inferior to cattle and horses. There, ordinary families frown and sigh when they have a daughter, and call for an unemployed old poor woman to come, treat her to a meal with wine and dishes, give her some money, and also say a lot of thank yous, asking her to take the baby girl away and send her to someone else to be a child bride or maid.

Equal to Cattle and Horses

If they encounter a kind-hearted old woman, she will really send the baby girl to the receiving family. When she grows up, she will become the family's daughter-in-law, always working hard and suffering bullying and abuse, living like cattle and horses. If they encounter a black-hearted old woman, she will take the child and go to a secluded place, first strip off the child's clothes, then throw the naked girl into the river. Passersby see it and think it is a common occurrence and do not interfere. Poor families have even more vicious methods of giving birth to a girl, doing it themselves and throwing their daughters into a "abandoned baby pagoda." The so-called "abandoned baby pagoda" is a hollow stone pagoda with a round hole near the top on the outside. Abandoned babies are thrown in through this hole, becoming buried alive. There are many such stone pagodas in Xinxing County. On average, each "abandoned baby pagoda" has at least two or three innocent girls born inside every day.

Everyone, please close your eyes and imagine: what a shocking and shameful picture this is!

### Guarantee the Salaries of the Working Class and Promote Occupational Insurance

— Ji Shui

"Unemployment" is more terrifying than poverty, sickness, or death. Like war, it is the most terrible thing in the world!

As long as you have a job, you can at least get a basic living. Soldiers, doctors will treat us; death, optimistic people see it very calmly. But what about "unemployment"? The basic living is interrupted, and no doctor will treat you. Even the most optimistic people will shake their heads and sigh.

Although some people express sympathy for the "unemployed," most are unable to help, and some only express sympathy. As for those employment agencies and the social services above, they are just thinking about introductions.

Therefore, we must promote "occupational insurance," to promote an institution that can not only introduce jobs but also provide living expenses for a family during unemployment. We must ask friends who currently have jobs to try to imagine the suffering of being unemployed, and work together with one heart, embracing the good intention of "everyone for me, me for everyone," to organize an "occupational insurance" institution!

Occupational insurance institutions are similar to other life insurance, etc., and also contain some spirit of cooperative undertakings, and are even more active, not only providing living expenses for the families of unemployed people who have been insured, but also undertaking the obligation of introducing jobs, as well as investigating the reasons for unemployment and assisting the unemployed to return to work.

In addition, we must also take on the obligations of job introduction and providing the minimum amount of living expenses for the unemployed who have not yet completed insurance procedures and paid insurance premiums. However, these living expenses must be repaid in installments from the date of employment.

If there is such an institution, wouldn't it be a great blessing for society? We look forward to it.

### Handsome Harryman — The New US Secretary of Commerce

— You Nan

After Wallace's departure, President Truman announced on the 23rd of last month that Harryman would take over as the US Secretary of Commerce. The following are the life events of this man.

Not a Bad Reputation

William Averell Harriman was originally a giant in the American railway and financial circles. In March 1941, he went to the United Kingdom as a minister to negotiate the extension of the Lend-Lease Act. In September of the same year, he led the American delegation, accompanied by former British Minister of Production Beaverbrook, to Moscow to formulate the Lend-Lease Aid Act between the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union. In 1942, he participated in the three-person meeting between Churchill and Stalin. In October 1943, he was ordered to serve as the US Ambassador to the Soviet Union. He had a good reputation in the Soviet Union. When he left the country, Stalin specially gave him two fine horses.

From Harryman's past experience, it can be proved that he is also an important figure on the American political stage.

A Rich Man

Harryman's father was also a well-known industrialist during his lifetime. He served as the chairman of two American railway companies and planned and built many railways. After his death, Harryman inherited a legacy of 25 million US dollars. Later, he lightly managed and used this huge amount of funds, resulting in his current position as the fourth richest man in the United States, with property too much to accurately estimate.

However, Harryman's life is very civilian. He often eats in small restaurants, and occasionally talks and laughs with street vendors informally. He has a good eloquence. His political enemies call him "a mysterious man."

A Fine Gentleman

He is very particular about clothing. He likes to wear gray-brown western cowboy clothes and also wears a wide-brimmed hat, which makes him look very handsome. In the past, he was listed as one of the top ten handsome men in the United States.

Harryman is a graduate of Yale University in 1913. When he was studying at the school, he often used summer vacations to work as a surveyor and a local firefighter. After graduation, he worked in the railway company headed by his father. He has a thorough research on cultural exchange and railway administration, so President Roosevelt often consulted him on railway administration matters.

Pretty Daughter

Wherever Harryman goes, he is mostly accompanied by a young and beautiful woman, who is his capable daughter, Kathleen. She takes care of all the housework for her father.

When Harryman took office as Secretary of Commerce, he issued a statement supporting President Truman and Byrnes's political views, and said that the development of American trade depends on the cooperation and peace of all countries in the world.
