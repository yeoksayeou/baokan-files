### The Overall Situation Still Needs Effort; Transportation Restoration Under Negotiation

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 11th] According to reliable sources, regarding the CCP issue, the government will not accept any conditions from the CCP beyond the three points stated on June 6th: (1) Complete cessation of conflict in the Northeast, (2) Complete restoration of domestic transportation, and (3) Prompt implementation of the agreement on nationwide demobilization, reorganization, and unification of troops. In fact, the CCP has not presented any conditions to date. Furthermore, representatives of the China Youth Party and the Democratic League, such as Zhang Junmai, have not advocated for extending the 15-day ceasefire period by any amount of time, nor have they put forward any conditions as intermediaries.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 11th] Pre-conference activities for the Military Three-Person Council are still ongoing today, solely involving individual exchanges of opinions. It is said that a meeting may be held within the next few days. Regarding the negotiations for restoring transportation, Colonel Moore, the transportation advisor to General Marshall and the chief of the Railway Management Section of the Field Headquarters, continued discussions on the 11th with our Minister of Transportation Yu Dawei and CCP representative Zhou Enlai. It is said that these negotiations have progressed to the point where both sides have presented concrete proposals. Once the meeting is successful, transportation executive groups may be dispatched rapidly to the Jinpu (Tianjin-Pukou) and Jiaoji (Jiaozhou-Jinan) lines to oversee the restoration of the railways. According to sources close to General Marshall, he hopes that both sides can quickly narrow the distance in their opinions on reopening the Military Three-Person Council and transportation negotiations. Observing the current situation, if the CCP can reflect in a timely manner and refrain from creating further complications, and can promptly dispatch ceasefire and transportation executive groups to Qingdao, Jinan, Tai'an, and Dezhou to extinguish the rekindled flames of war, it will be beneficial to peace negotiations.

[United Press International, Beiping, 11th] Today, according to a dispatch from the Central News Agency's Shenyang correspondent: General Marshall will soon visit Changchun. However, this news has not been confirmed by other sources.

[Central News Agency, This City] Representatives of the Democratic League and the Political Consultative Conference, Luo Longji, Zhang Bojun, Huang Yanpei, and Shen Junqiao, returned to Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday. Liang Shuming will also arrive here in the coming days. According to Huang Yanpei, after exchanging views with various parties in Nanjing, the representatives of the Democratic League believe that considerable effort is still needed for the overall situation to develop. If the 15-day ceasefire talks do not reach a complete resolution, it would be worthwhile to extend the time, so that the limited ceasefire can be transformed into unlimited peace. At the same time, it is hoped that the Three-Person Group can quickly resolve the superficial military problems and then move on to resolving the fundamental political problems. They met with General Marshall in Nanjing and found his words to be most appropriate: "To be open and honest about the current situation, the third party must make efforts between the KMT and the CCP." Huang also revealed that representatives from the Democratic League, the Youth Party, and prominent figures will continue discussions in Nanjing on the 16th. At that time, they may issue a comprehensive opinion on the current situation. Recently, there will also be an informal discussion in Shanghai first. According to Chang Yansheng, a Youth Party representative to the Political Consultative Conference, after discussions with representatives from various parties in Nanjing, opinions have become more aligned, hoping that the overall situation can maintain peaceful development and that the KMT and the CCP can reach an understanding. Furthermore, Li Huang, a standing committee member of the party, was still in Nanjing yesterday.

### The Situation in Lafa Was Unclear Yesterday; Shenyang Dispatched Planes for Reconnaissance

[Our Newspaper Shenyang, 11th] Lafa, which is on the same line as Changchun and Yongji and is also a transportation hub, is in an unknown situation after being fiercely attacked by the Communist forces. Shenyang dispatched planes for reconnaissance but failed to make contact with the defending troops. Another report states that Lafa has been captured by the Communist forces.

[Central News Agency Changchun, 11th] The Communist forces, commanded by Lin Biao, launched several fierce attacks on Lafa on the 9th with their First Division and an independent brigade, but were repelled by the National Army. On the 10th, the Communist forces successively increased their strength to 22 regiments (including one artillery regiment) and launched another fierce attack on Lafa and the areas west of it, including Big and Small Gujia Mountain and Guan Laoye Ridge. Fierce fighting is still ongoing.

[Central News Agency Changchun, 10th] The Communist forces, commanded by Lin Biao's First Division and an independent brigade, launched an all-out attack on the National Army in Lafa on the 9th. After engaging in bayonet combat, the Communist forces were repelled. The National Army suffered more than 140 casualties. On the 10th, the Communist forces continued to launch fierce attacks on the National Army. The National Army in the areas west of Lafa, including Big and Small Gujiazi and the 769 Heights southeast of Laoye Ridge, is currently engaged in fierce fighting with the Communist forces. According to captured Communist soldiers, the Communist forces are determined to first occupy Lafa Laoye Ridge and then attempt to seize Yongji. The area near Lafa has been set ablaze by the Communist forces, with flames filling the sky. The Communist forces have now added 21 infantry regiments and one artillery regiment. The National Army at Old Station, 10 kilometers south of Lafa, has been forced to withdraw after being fiercely attacked by the Communist forces. Four days after the ceasefire order was issued, the Communist forces continue to disregard faith and create this unfortunate incident.

[Another Telegram] According to Communist soldiers captured in Lafa on the night of the 9th, Lin Biao personally led the First Division, attached with more than 20 artillery pieces, to attack the front of the National Army in Lafa. The Second Division attacked the flanks of the National Army in Lafa. Another Communist garrison battalion attacked the National Army in Laoye Ridge, attempting to disrupt the transportation on the Laji Line.

### The Military Mediation Department Neglected, Bai Lude Flies Back to Beiping

[Our Newspaper Beiping, 11th] The government side of the Military Mediation Department has protested to the CCP regarding the large-scale offensive launched by the Communist forces in Shandong and other places, as well as the successive captures of various locations. It has also telegraphed the relevant groups to conduct a thorough investigation and report back, centered around the US side. The atmosphere in the department has been quite disharmonious recently. During meetings, extreme views are expressed, or poor attitudes are displayed, leading to unpleasant endings. Bao Shilin, the CCP's executive director, left the Executive Headquarters four days ago and returned to Linyi, Shandong. It is said that he is one of those who left because he was not suited for this kind of work. His position has been temporarily filled by Chen Shiqu. Luo Ruiqing, the Communist Chief of Staff, has not been to the Military Mediation Department for several days. Therefore, despite the frequent occurrence of military conflicts in various places, the Military Mediation Department has become neglected. One responsible person even stated: "If this continues, the Military Mediation Department will close its doors when the 15-day negotiation period expires." All of this makes people feel the difficulties ahead. However, the staff sent by the government to Changchun in preparation for mediating the Changchun branch of the Military Mediation Department will still dispatch Tang Gongtong, the director of the committee office, tomorrow. Niu Xianming of the headquarters is also preparing to go.

[Our Newspaper Beiping, 11th] Bai Lude flew back here this afternoon to treat a dental ailment.

### Ge Jingen's Remarks: No Bureaucratic Capital Found in Taiwan

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 11th] Ge Jingen told our reporter on the 11th: The transportation to and from Taiwan Province still needs to be strengthened. It is hoped that the convenience of transportation will promote the economic revival and cultural progress of Taiwan Province, so as to reduce the estrangement of foreigners from Taiwan.

### The Truth About the Communist Army's Attacks and Road Destruction After Noon on the 7th of This Month; Officially Announced Yesterday by the Spokesperson of the Ministry of National Defense

[Central News Agency Nanjing, 11th] The spokesperson of the Ministry of National Defense issued a statement on the 11th, stating that peace, unity, and national construction are the government's consistent aims. Since the government issued orders on January 10th of this year to cease conflicts and restore transportation, the National Army has strictly obeyed the orders and faithfully implemented them. However, the Communist forces in various places have not complied with mediation, launched widespread offensives, attacked the National Army, and expanded their territory. At the same time, they have wantonly propagated and blamed the government in an attempt to shift responsibility. The National Army's entry into the Northeast to restore sovereignty is not subject to any restrictions, which was agreed and signed by the CCP. However, the Communist forces initially took the opportunity to assemble their troops and occupy various coastal ports and overland transportation routes from the customs areas. Subsequently, they wanted to occupy Sipingjie, Changchun, Harbin, and many other important towns and cities that the government had already sent personnel to receive. In order to restore sovereignty in the Northeast, the National Army overcame all difficulties and obstacles. After recovering Sipingjie and Changchun, it would not have been difficult to go directly north and complete its mission. However, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek was concerned about the past fourteen years of suffering of the Northeastern compatriots under the enemy and puppet's iron hooves, and could not bear to inflict war again. Therefore, he formally announced an order to cease military action on the 6th of this month, giving the CCP another opportunity to fulfill the agreement, which was also agreed to by the CCP representatives. The actions of the Communist forces after the 7th of this month did not diminish at all due to the ceasefire order. In order to make the whole country understand the truth and urge the Communist forces to wake up, the following is a list of the facts of the Communist forces' attacks on the National Army and destruction of transportation since 12:00 noon on the 7th of this month: Northeast: The National Army obeyed Chairman Chiang's order and completely stopped pursuing, advancing, and attacking from noon on the 7th. However, the Communist forces did not abide by faith and took this opportunity to use the railway to simultaneously increase troops in the north and south. Three hours after the ceasefire order in the Northeast took effect, they launched fierce offensives against the National Army's positions, including: (1) The National Army in Lafa, east of Yongji, was surrounded and fiercely attacked on the evening of the 7th by the Communist First Division and the Seventh Column of the Jilin Military Region, which had sneaked in from the Gangdun Railway. As of the 10th, its strength had increased to 22 regiments, and fierce fighting was still ongoing. A 3-kilometer tunnel in Laoye Ridge was destroyed by the Communist forces. (2) At 3:00 PM on the 7th, the Communist forces launched a fierce attack on the National Army between Yushu County, Wukeshu, and approximately 20 kilometers southeast of Taolaizhao. Communist forces near Taolaizhao also attacked the National Army at the same time. (3) The 21st Brigade of the Communist forces near Falahai, 30 kilometers northwest of Nongan, launched a fierce attack on the National Army starting at 3:00 PM on the 7th. By 8:00 PM, the Communist forces had increased by more than 1,000 and continued the attack. (4) The Weijin River Estuary railway bridge south of Andong was destroyed by the Communist forces on the evening of the 8th. (5) On the evening of the 8th, the Communist forces attacked the National Army in Wuchengzi and Qianhou Mafeng Mountain, southeast of Haicheng, from Shahezi. They were repelled by the National Army on the evening of the 9th. In the above-mentioned areas, the National Army was attacked by the Communist forces, but in order to strictly abide by orders and respect faith, it only took self-defense measures in its positions and did not counterattack. (To be continued)

### Dezhou Falls, Street Fighting in Tai'an; Outskirts of Jinan War Spreads; Communist Forces in Southern Shandong Advancing Towards Xuzhou

According to airline pilots carrying food and medicine to Tai'an and Dezhou for delivery, the people inside and outside the two cities are being killed by stray bullets and starvation, lying dead on the streets, which is clearly visible. Moreover, many children's corpses were seen, which was extremely tragic.

[Our Newspaper Zhenjiang, 11th] The Communist forces in northern Jiangsu are currently being transferred to southern Shandong to reinforce the area due to the fierce fighting in southern Shandong. In addition, the military secret bureaus and warehouses established by the Communist forces in Huaian, Cheqiao, Siyang Zhuangfang Suqian, and Tou Shaodian are transporting materials to southern Shandong day and night.

[Our Newspaper Jinan, 10th] The war situation in various parts of Shandong on the 10th remained intense.

The National Army in Dakouwen only occupies a small stronghold, and the situation is critical. (3) On the 10th at noon, two Communist aircraft dropped two bombs on the south gate of Dezhou, completely destroying the airport.

[Central News Agency Qingdao, 11th] The Communist forces attacked Qingdao City with a regiment. After the garrison stationed on the outskirts of the city bravely fought back, the original defense lines from nine days ago were restored on the morning of the 11th. All sectors of Qingdao City expressed their appreciation for the merits of the defending troops and launched a comfort campaign, raising more than 10 million yuan in donations and a large amount of treasures to be sent to the Xiazhuang area.

### Communication With Small Groups in Shandong and Southern Hebei War Zones Is Interrupted

The five groups are stationed in Tai'an, Zaozhuang, Gaomi, Dezhou, and Yongnian, namely Groups 16, 22, 15, 21, and 31. The actual situation of the American personnel in each of these groups is unknown, but their radio communications have indeed lost contact with the headquarters.

[Central News Agency Beiping, 11th] According to sources, the Communist forces in Shandong launched a large-scale offensive against Dezhou on the evening of the 7th. The National Army was trapped for four days, ran out of ammunition and food, and was finally captured by the Communist forces on the evening of the 10th.

[Central News Agency Zhengzhou, 10th] On the 9th, the Communist forces concentrated more than 10,000 troops near the Caoxian Railway Station and along the Longhai Railway in the Mincheng area, presenting a tense situation.

### Mongolian Banner Delegation Arrives in Beiping; Will Fly to Nanjing to Pay Respects to the Chairman

[Our Newspaper Beiping, 11th] Most members of the Mongolian Banner delegation celebrating victory and returning to the capital have already flown to Beiping on the 6th and 8th. They will soon fly to Nanjing to pay respects to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. The delegation consists of Mongolian Banner personnel who participated in the War of Resistance Against Japan, totaling ten members.

[Our Newspaper Beiping, 11th] After the Mongolian Banner delegation arrived in Beiping, the delegation leader, Rong Xiang, the Mongolian Pacification Commissioner, Ba Wenjun, Secretary-General of the Mongolian Affairs Committee, and Committee Member Hu Fengshan had a long conversation with our reporter for two hours. They unanimously believed: (1) The resolutions on the frontier areas passed by the 19th meeting of the Second Plenary Session are extremely reasonable. The people of the frontier areas are excited by the news and deeply hope that the resolutions can be implemented as soon as possible. (2) The Mongolian Autonomous Political Affairs Committee should be restored as soon as possible, so that Inner Mongolia, where the internal and external situations are unusually complex, can obtain unified leadership as soon as possible. (3) The powers and responsibilities of the banner and the county should be clearly defined. (4) The government should be lenient towards the Mongolian youths who were coerced into participating in the puppet organizations in the past. However, traitors who willingly submitted to the enemy are absolutely not qualified to participate in the Mongolian political institutions after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan. (5) The Mongolian areas that were occupied suffered extremely severely during the War of Resistance, and it is hoped that the Executive Yuan will provide effective relief.

### Revised Financial Revenue and Expenditure System Will Be Implemented Starting July 1st

[Central News Agency Nanjing, 11th] The revised financial revenue and expenditure system will be officially implemented starting on July 1st of this year. The implementation association for the revised financial revenue and expenditure system has already approved various related implementation measures. The revised financial revenue and expenditure system is divided into three levels: (1) central, (2) provincial and municipal, and (3) county (establishment bureau administration) and provincial cities, townships and towns finances, shall be separately budgeted and included in the county (bureau) city general budget. The financial revenue and expenditure of provinces and municipalities directly under the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan will be directly supervised by the central administrative, legislative, and supervisory authorities before autonomy is achieved, and will be directly supervised by the provincial and municipal council after autonomy is achieved, and indirectly supervised by the central authorities. The financial revenue and expenditure of counties (bureaus) cities will be directly supervised by the province before autonomy is achieved, and will be directly supervised by the county (bureau) city council after autonomy is achieved, and indirectly supervised by the province.

[Central News Agency Nanjing, 11th] The meeting to implement the revised financial revenue and expenditure system passed a suggestion on tightening the provincial and county institutions on the 10th. The methods are: (1) If the machinery originally established at all levels of provinces (cities) counties (cities) has overlapping business or is not necessary in fact, the provinces and cities may consider their financial resources and cut and merge them. (2) If the central government later orders provincial and municipal governments to handle business, they should be asked to use the original institutions and not set up new ones. (3) For matters entrusted by the Central Government in the future, the entrusting agency should be asked to issue funds, and if there are matters such as requisitioning labor and purchasing goods, they should also be issued on time and in full according to the local market price, so as to avoid differential assignments and causing unfair apportionment and harassment. The meeting also passed that special institutions established by the central government in various provinces, counties and cities are not legally based, duplicated or unnecessary in fact, and should be negotiated by the central provincial city and county authorities to cut and merge.

### National Army Strictly Observes Ceasefire Order, Hopes the Communist Party Sincerely Reflects, Minister Peng of the Central Propaganda Department Issues Statement

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th Dispatch] Peng Xuepei, Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, answered inquiries from our newspaper reporter alone at 4:40 PM on the 11th. (1) Asked whether the recent talks on a ceasefire mediated by Special Envoy Marshall had yielded any results? Answered that opinions were still being exchanged. (2) Asked whether it was possible to hold a meeting of the Military Three-Person Committee soon? Answered that it could be held at any time after the two sides' opinions approached each other. (3) Asked what countermeasures the government would take against the Communist army's blatant violation of the 15-day ceasefire agreement in various places inside and outside the customs? Answered that the government adheres to its ceasefire promises, and the national army strictly obeys the ceasefire order. This is a fact recognized worldwide, but the government cannot stand idly by while people are dying, and the national army cannot abandon its duty to maintain law and order and protect the people. If the Communist army disturbs the local area or attacks the national army, the local national army will naturally fight back for self-defense. However, the national army only takes it as its duty to repel the invading Communist army and does not pursue it.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th Dispatch] Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, Peng Xuepei, briefly addressed a press conference on the 12th, stating: Chairman Chiang has already announced a 15-day cessation of military action in the Northeast, allowing the Communist Party to show sincerity and quickly resolve the pressing issues of stopping the conflict, restoring transportation, and reorganizing and unifying troops. The Chairman sincerely hopes that the negotiations will yield results to relieve the people from their suffering. He hopes that the news media will work together, understanding the Chairman's painstaking efforts to seek peace through compromise, and move towards this goal together. All unconfirmed news and indiscriminate criticisms must be carefully and resolutely eliminated. In particular, newspapers related to the government should pay special attention. Even if the Communist Party makes excessive remarks, they must be very patient and not respond with harsh words. However, the Propaganda Department certainly cannot prohibit the reporting of facts. For example, the Communist army fiercely attacked Dezhou on the 8th and blew up the Hanzhuang Bridge on the 9th. These are facts. During this period when both sides had ordered a cessation of military action, the Communist army launched a large-scale offensive in Shandong, delivering a head-on blow to the peace talks. This is what we feel most pained about. Under these circumstances, the government is truly in a very difficult position. Can the government sit idly by and not provide assistance? Can negotiations have results in this way? We hope that the Communist army will sincerely reflect and not cease fire in the Northeast while starting a war in Shandong, causing the people to suffer sacrifices and friendly nations to feel disappointed. This is our sincere hope.

### Reasons for Allowing Foreign Ships to Enter Inner Ports: Encourage Exports and Reduce Freight, Peng Xuepei Hopes Shipping Companies Will Overcome Difficulties Together

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th Dispatch] Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, Peng Xuepei, stated when receiving reporters on the afternoon of the 11th that recently the government has specially allowed foreign ships to load and unload direct import and export goods in the four ports of Hankou, Jiujiang, Gulou, and Nanjing, for a period of one year. They are only allowed to load export goods that are directly exported abroad, or import goods that come directly from foreign countries. They are not allowed to load and unload goods within China that are transported from Port A to Port B. This measure has been passed through a solemn and legal procedure and has been implemented. Some domestic shipping companies seem to have some doubts about this, and I would like to add a few words of explanation. There are two reasons why the government has adopted this measure: (1) At present, our people are absorbing a large amount of import goods like thirsty people drink, and as such, we must further encourage exports to balance it out, otherwise, our country's economy and currency system will be greatly threatened. However, our domestic river vessels are lacking, and it is quite difficult to transport goods from various inland river ports to the seaport. The exorbitant inland river freight rates are proof of the extreme shortage of ships. The Swedish Minister said that the freight rate from Sweden to Wusong is lower than the freight rate from Wusong to the Shanghai Bund Wharf. This is a fact. Because barges are lacking, and everything relies on manual labor, and there is a lack of mechanical equipment, the cost of each transfer is extremely high. This cost is a major blow to export goods in particular. Also, the transportation of some export goods requires special equipment. For example, if eggs shipped from Hankou to the UK need to be transferred in Shanghai, not only will the freight increase, but damage is also a concern. Flexible measures should be taken to increase the volume of transportation and reduce freight and losses. (2) At present, Shanghai is crowded with goods, and warehouse space is extremely difficult to find. Ships arriving at the port often cannot find a pier position, and even the mooring buoys are not enough. Foreign ships often dock outside the Wusong Estuary, waiting for space for several weeks. If some ships can directly sail to the inner port, this can also reduce such delays. This measure is an emergency measure during the recovery period and is only valid for one year. The government is doing its utmost to protect and encourage the domestic shipping industry and is constantly considering it. Shipping industry colleagues, please rest assured that the government must weigh the pros and cons in order to save the current emergency situation. In urgent situations, we must treat the symptoms first. I hope everyone will understand the difficulties of the times and overcome them together.

### Editorial: Starting from the "Western European Bloc"

Recently, general elections were held in France and Italy, and the Catholic parties won great victories. As a result of the French general election, the Popular Republican Movement, led by Foreign Minister Bidault, that is, the progressive Catholic Party, gained an absolute advantage in the new Constituent Assembly, leaping to become the number one party in France today. At the same time, the momentum of the Communist Party has sharply decreased and it can no longer control the French political situation. The same is true in Italy. In the Dutch general election, the Catholic Party also became the number one party in the country. These signs have led some people to believe that the mainland of Western Europe seems to be becoming the world of conservative forces. Except for Spain and Portugal, which are ruled by Catholic totalitarian regimes, the rest are all influenced by democratic, gradualist, right-wing Catholic parties. A London political observer once said: The famous "Western European Bloc" seems to be gradually becoming a reality, but its center is not in socialist Britain but in the Vatican. Including France and Italy, the sphere of influence of Catholic parties will include the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Austria, and parts of southern Germany. This is indeed a trend worthy of attention by the world.

The rise of Catholic parties in France, Italy, and other Western European countries this time probably indicates, on the other hand, the loss of sympathy for the Communist Party. After the long suffering of the war, the Communist Party originally wanted to take the opportunity to seize power, but the will of the people resolutely rejected it. Democracy, after all, triumphed over dictatorship. The instruction given to us by the elections in France and Italy this time is that in a democratic country, the people clearly reject the Communist Party, which shows that there are indeed some differences between democracy and communism. As long as there is true democracy, the Communist Party's dictatorial and autocratic methods will not be able to stand, and no one can use the beautiful name of democracy to support the Communist Party. The Communist Party's consistent style is to bluff and intimidate, using a minority to control the majority and seize power. After the defeat of Germany, the Communist Party's momentum in France and Italy could not be said to be weak at first, but the will of the people cannot be deceived; the Communist Parties of the two countries were finally rejected by the people. China is now embarking on the path of democracy, and there is no concrete way to express public opinion yet. However, the people's general feelings can be said to be wary of the Communist Party. In view of the failure of the Communist Parties in France and Italy, we believe that as long as the government is enlightened and truly implements democratic politics, allowing the Chinese people to vote freely, the party disputes that are not clear in China now can be resolved peacefully, and the Communist Party does not have to dream of spreading the seeds of communism in China.

Since the revolution in France, in the past 150 years or so, the political tides have ebbed and flowed, but they all have a common characteristic, which is opposition to the Catholic Church. Since the Third Republic, the anti-religious wind has become more intense, and the existence of the Catholic Church in France has been frequently attacked by politicians. The state has even promulgated laws to restrict church activities. All of these things have historical and ideological backgrounds. For more than a hundred years, Europe has been shackled by the ideas of the French Revolution, and the result has been the emergence of tyrannical collectivism in Europe, and France itself has been devastated by this tyrannical collectivism. Now that Hitlerism has been defeated, another collectivism is attempting to wield tyranny. What the people need today is stability rather than new experiments. They have freed themselves from the naive ideas of the French Revolution, restored their inherent glorious traditions, and exerted their strength. This is the rise and prevalence of Catholic parties. Moreover, it is worth noting that this trend extends throughout Western Europe, not limited to France. Due to this trend, we feel that the current political situation in our country should not be prolonged any longer. The Chinese people have a peaceful nature and a tradition of moderation, which is really incompatible with the essence and style of the Communist Party, and they may not truly represent the will of the people. Today, the ideals of the Catholic parties that are prevalent in Western Europe are somewhat similar to the Chinese ideal of moderation, and the Three Principles of the People are the crystallization of the ideal of moderation in politics. What we are asking for today is for the Kuomintang to take a breath and earnestly implement the Three Principles of the People.

The rise of Catholic parties in Western Europe represents a new awakening of the Western European people. They feel that the chaos caused by the Reformation has increased Europe's disturbances and suffering. Only by making politics religious, so that practical politics can practice the ideals of religion, can social order and even international order tend towards stability. This is a trend worthy of our attention. As for what some observers have said, that the famous "Western European Bloc" seems to be gradually becoming a reality, with the Vatican as its center, it is somewhat of an overstatement. The Vatican is the residence of the Catholic Pope, and it itself does not participate in direct politics, it is purely a supra-political religious organization. It is true that Catholic believers regard the Pope as their spiritual leader, but it is clear that the Vatican is the center of the "Western European Bloc". A few days ago, Bishop Cai Ning explained in China that the Pope of the Vatican does not use power to force Catholics to oppose the Communist Party. We also believe that the reduction of the people's confidence in the Communist Party in several Western European countries is one thing, and the religious organization of Catholicism is another. The Vatican exists supra-politically and supra-nationally, and is not related to the formation of the Western European Bloc.

### Local Communications Qinghai Provincial Government Ordered to Build Qingxin Highway Establishment of Engineering Office Headed by Chairman Ma

Achieving the Goal of Consolidating National Defense and Prospering the Northwest Mobilizing More Than 7,000 Soldiers and Civilians to Complete Within the Year

[Our Newspaper, Qinghai Communication] The Qinghai Provincial Government, under orders to be responsible for the construction of the Qingxin Highway, has specially established the Qingxin Highway Engineering Office, headed by Chairman Ma, to connect the transportation arteries of Qinghai and Xinjiang, with the goal of achieving the objectives of consolidating national defense and prospering the Northwest in the shortest possible time. This road starts from Xining, passes through Huangyuan, Du, Chaidan, the Qaidam Basin, crosses the Arjin Mountains, and reaches Ruoqiang in Xinjiang. All engineers and technicians have been assigned to Qinghai by the Northwest Highway Bureau and started work under the direction of the provincial government last month. Civilian workers are borne by the Mongol and Tibetan people in Huangyuan, Yuan, and near the highway. Because the other counties in the province have been repairing roads and planting trees for years, and other labor services are heavier, they have been temporarily suspended from service. In addition, officers and soldiers of the security cavalry regiment were dispatched from Xining on May 14 to work in front. They also supervise civilian workers to protect public security. This road construction project is extremely difficult, and it is divided into ten general sections and thirty sub-sections, each with a general and sub-section chief to be responsible. It is planned to complete the section from Daotang River to Dosi this year, which will require more than 1,000 soldiers and workers and more than 6,600 civilian workers for a total of five months. By October, due to the cold weather and frozen ground, work can be stopped. Working equipment, food, money, and transportation and accommodation will also be prepared and distributed as required, and construction can begin in June.

Suzhou Improving People's Self-Defense Organization

The county government believes that the cadres of the people's self-defense teams in various rural areas are extremely important. If the candidates are not properly selected, it will easily cause chaos. If they are minor, they will not be able to take responsibility for improving their own organization, and if they are major, they will delay local public security. For the sake of prudence, it is necessary to adjust them. A short-term training class is planned to be held to selectively transfer incumbent cadres of self-defense teams from various places to receive training in order to be competent.

Changshu Extremely Hot Weather Discovers Seasonal Epidemic

The weather is extremely hot, and the room temperature has reached 90 degrees Fahrenheit. True cholera has been discovered in the vicinity of the county seat, and more than 20 people have died. Other rural areas have also discovered it. The county government has organized an epidemic prevention committee and will start to administer vaccinations extensively from the 11th. It has also established a seasonal epidemic hospital, and the public hospital has opened a consultation and treatment center, which opened on the 9th.

Huzhou Large Gang of Bandits Loots Xintang

Robberies have occurred in the counties and towns of Huzhou for days on end, without a day passing without them. The general public is in deep water and fire. Although military and police have pursued and suppressed them, they flee here and there, and their movements are irregular. A large gang of more than 50 bandits was discovered in Xintang Town, Changxing on the 7th. They were fully equipped with machine guns and rifles, and looted shops and homes, causing heavy losses to the people. Those responsible for public security should severely suppress and eliminate them in order to protect local security.

Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Meeting Approaching Soon: Byrnes Flies to Paris Today; Yesterday Explained the Importance of This Meeting to Reporters, Saying Failure Would Be a Failure for All Humanity

[Our Newspaper's Report] San Francisco, 11th: U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes will fly to Paris tomorrow to attend the Foreign Ministers' Conference. Today, he held his last press conference before leaving America. It is said that if this renewed Foreign Ministers' Conference fails again, it will be a failure for all mankind and the four major powers. Byrnes also stated that since the adjournment of the last Foreign Ministers' Conference, no progress has been made on solving the issues.

Byrnes also said: He is not pessimistic about the future of the meeting, but sincerely prays for its success. People of all countries should not compete with each other and treat the meeting like a football game, measuring any progress by the diplomatic victory of one country or another.

[United Press, Washington, 10th] U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes is going to Paris again this week to attend the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference. Whether the postwar world space is just one or will be divided into two may come to light at this conference. Byrnes has set a deadline for himself to complete the peace in Europe, and he has decided to conclude treaties with Italy and Eastern European countries by the end of this year, no matter what. He believes that this is an essential step to restore the world's vitality. To achieve this goal, Byrnes seems ready to move forward bravely, even without cooperation with the Soviet Union if necessary.

Representatives of British Foreign Secretary Bevin, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, French Foreign Minister Bidault, and U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes have been continuously negotiating in Paris, but according to diplomatic sources here, they have not made any progress on resolving any major issues.

According to solemn declarations from diplomatic authorities: the upcoming Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference has two important paths to take, but it is unknown which one will be chosen. One is that the major powers cooperate together, and the other is that only Britain and the United States cooperate, while the Soviet Union intensifies its control over its sphere of influence, and France, due to the strong influence of the Communist Party within the country, has also become a difficult land to deal with. In other words, if the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference fails, the gap between the Soviet Union and the Western powers will widen further.

Regarding the issue of atomic energy, it is said that the United States is prepared to make concrete proposals to establish an international atomic energy development agency, which will control all places in the world that produce atomic energy raw materials. According to this method, as all countries obtain guarantees internationally, then all countries, including the United States, will gradually publicly announce all their atomic energy information and secrets one by one.

### The Soviet Union Expresses Opposition to Expanding the Japanese Fishing Zone: There Will Be Heated Debates at the Control Council for Japan

[United Press, Tokyo, 11th] Well-informed sources said today: When the Control Council for Japan holds a meeting tomorrow, the United States and the Soviet Union may have a fierce conflict over the issue of expanding Japan's fishing area. Existing signs indicate that MacArthur intends to request the council to consider his proposal to expand the existing navigation area for Japanese fishing boats. U.S. Representative Atchison, based on the reason that Japan's food shortage is serious and needs to find more aquatic food, intends to propose expanding the new restricted area. However, according to United Press, Soviet Representative Televyanko seems to oppose any motion to expand the fishing area. According to some U.S. officials, the Soviet Union's excuse for opposing is that expanding the freedom of navigation of Japanese fishing boats may be intended to allow the Japanese to enter the Soviet Union's fishing area to the north.

### Bohlen's Visit to Moscow Allegedly Denied by the White House

[United Press, Washington, 10th] White House Press Secretary Ross told reporters today: Reports that U.S. Reparations Commissioner Pauley will go to Moscow in July to contact Marshal Stalin on behalf of President Truman are purely speculative.

### The Azerbaijan Province Issue in Iran Has Been Resolved

[United Press, Tehran, 11th] A Foreign Ministry spokesperson said today that the Azerbaijan province issue has been resolved in accordance with the seven-point plan proposed by Prime Minister Sadana a few weeks ago. A government delegation, led by the Minister of Propaganda, has already flown to Tabriz by Soviet plane today to discuss the final details of the province's return to government control. According to the resolution, the Azerbaijan provincial army and militia will be incorporated into the central army and gendarmerie, and the "Prime Minister of the Cabinet" of Azerbaijan will be changed to the provincial governor.

### Setback in Political Transition: Italian King Refuses to Transfer Power; Cabinet Decides to Request the Prime Minister to Exercise the Powers of the Head of State; Royalist Demonstrations in Naples Advocate Southern Independence

[Our Newspaper's Report] London, 11th: The Italian Cabinet held an emergency meeting today and unanimously decided to request Prime Minister Gasperi to immediately exercise the powers of a head of state. After the meeting, the Prime Minister immediately entered the palace to discuss this issue with Italian King Umberto.

Another report: The Italian King refused to abdicate, saying that he will not abdicate until the Supreme Court confirms the results of the referendum.

[Central News Agency, Rome, 11th, United Press] Italian King Umberto refused to transfer the powers of head of state to Prime Minister Gasperi at last night's ceremony. This was an unexpected setback in Italy's transition from a monarchy to a republic, as it was expected that the ceremony would only be a formality. The Italian Cabinet immediately convened an emergency meeting to consider the situation of the Italian King obstructing the reporting of the referendum votes. Gasperi went to the palace to meet with the Italian King, requesting that the Supreme Court formally announce the voting results.

[Our Newspaper's Report] London, 11th: The British Foreign Secretary today sent a telegram to the Italian Prime Minister, saying that the Italian national referendum was conducted very legally, and Britain's position on Italy remains unchanged.

[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 11th] The Italian Cabinet held an emergency meeting last night, which lasted for seven hours and did not end until 3 a.m. the next day. The possibility of holding a second referendum was discussed. It is heard that several ministers present believed that the establishment of the republic should be postponed, but no agreement was reached on this point.

[Agence France-Presse, Port of Naples, Italy, 11th] After the monarchy in Italy was overthrown by a referendum, the royalists were greatly angered. Today, royalists held a large-scale demonstration here, and the entire city was in turmoil. All Communist Party buildings were set on fire. The police came out in time to intervene, extinguished the fires, and fired shots into the air to disperse the crowd. This morning, the walls all over the city were plastered with leaflets from the "Committee for Separatist Action," which advocated that the southern provinces of Italy secede from the rest of the country. The reason was that the National Unity Treaty concluded in 1870 had been destroyed by the recent fraudulent and tyrannical referendum, and the southern provinces had to restore their political and economic freedom. By the afternoon, thousands of royalists paraded in the streets, demanding that all houses hang the flag of surrender of the Italian royal family. The city government did not hang the flag, and the protesters attacked it, smashing all the windows. Although the police used fire hoses to spray water on these people, the protesters did not care. The city government finally hung the flag, and the protesters withdrew but continued to parade in other streets. Finally, they were dispersed by the police, but the atmosphere throughout the city remained tense.

### French Popular Republican Movement Nominates Presidential Candidate: Bidault Has the Highest Reputation and Is Supported by the Entire Party

[Our Newspaper's Report] San Francisco, 11th: The Executive Committee of the French Popular Republican Movement unanimously nominated Foreign Minister Bidault as the party's candidate for the next French President. There is no doubt that Bidault will become the French President.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 11th] The Executive Committee of the French Popular Republican Movement held a meeting last night and passed a resolution requesting to accelerate the organization of a new cabinet and pass a new constitution. At the same time, the meeting decided to recommend former Cabinet Foreign Minister Bidault to serve as the new Prime Minister and lead the cabinet formation.

[United Press, Paris, 10th] The Popular Republican Movement began to organize a temporary new government today. Foreign Minister Bidault declared at a meeting of party leaders that the Popular Republican Movement has decided to accept the responsibility entrusted by the people and seize power.

[Reuters, Paris, 10th] Justice Minister Teitgen said at the Executive Committee of the Popular Republican Movement today: Our party will demand that the parliament elect one of our party members as the head of government. It is generally believed that the current Foreign Minister Bidault will be the party's presidential candidate.

Before the new government is established, the old government will continue to exercise its powers.

### New Types of War Are Becoming More and More Bizarre: Using Atomic Rays Can Wipe Out Fertility; Peaceful Uses Can Cause Rain

[United Press, New York, 10th] French physicist Joliot, one of the first scientists to discover that uranium atoms can produce a chain reaction, from which the atomic bomb, atomic energy, and radiation are produced. Joliot recently published an article in the Chicago Atomic Scientists Bulletin and gave a speech in London, predicting a new type of nuclear war using invisible atomic rays secretly. Humans will have no way of knowing when the war starts. According to Joliot, "In the future, a country with hundreds of atomic bombs may think it is well-prepared, but suddenly it will receive a warning from a statistical expert saying that the number of miscarriages among pregnant women in the central region has surged in the past five years, and none of the six women has a normal delivery. Along the coastal ports, fires have destroyed harvests, and the northern region is experiencing drought, causing the country to lose a quarter of its power. Then the government and parliament will thoroughly investigate these figures, and there will be only one explanation, that someone has been secretly waging war against it for several years, resulting in tremendous damage and countless sacrifices, and no one even noticed when the war broke out." Joliot's method of wiping out fertility can be caused by enemy spies secretly emitting X-rays from radioactive atomic materials. However, it can also cause other harm to humans, which Joliot did not mention, nor did he explain why the people could not recognize these signs. Joliot did not say how the fires occurred or how the climate was manipulated but said that once atomic bombs can be used for peaceful purposes, they can be used to change most of the ground or cause rain in vast areas. Even today, we know that in the future, we can change terrain and climate. New radioactive elements will enable chemical changes to occur at extremely high temperatures. Other foreign scientists have also predicted that the climate can be regulated. However, American scientists have not made any predictions about the energy produced by uranium, thorium, and aluminum, the three important elements for producing atomic energy today.

### Prelude to Testing Atomic Bombs: Airplanes Take Off to Test-Drop Dummy Bombs

[United Press, Near Bikini Atoll, Mount McKinley, 9th] The atomic bomb test unit's army and navy planes took off for the first time today, including about 75 planes from the bases of Kwajalein and Eniwetok and two aircraft carriers. Army Commander Major General Kepner took command on the flagship of Atomic Bomb Test Commander Vice Admiral Blandy. It is said that the test flight was satisfactory, but improvements are still needed in radio communication. During the test flight this morning, a B-29 plane dropped a dummy bomb from high altitude, but the personnel on the ship did not see it because the plane was flying too high and too fast. The test flight was explored by the flagship using radar.

### Albanian Political and Spiritual Leader Huseini Flees from Paris: Britain Lodges a Protest with France, Considering This an Unfriendly Act Towards Britain; Fears That the Tiger's Escape Will Affect the Situation in the Middle East

[Reuters, Jerusalem, 10th] Residents of the Old City of Jerusalem believe that Grand Mufti Huseini, the political and spiritual leader of the Palestinian Arabs, is on his way here. Arab flags and portraits of the Mufti are hung all over the streets of the Old City. Huseini was involved in the anti-British riots in Iraq in 1941.

[Reuters, London, 10th] The whereabouts of Grand Mufti Huseini of Jerusalem, who has disappeared from Paris, are still unknown. The claim that he has arrived in Damascus has been proven untrue. His brother-in-law, Huseini, chairman of the Arab Higher Committee, is now attending the Arab League Council meeting in Bludan, 40 miles from Damascus. The League Council sent a letter to the French government on April 6, thanking them for protecting Huseini.

Huseini

Was originally in Germany

After the collapse of the Nazis, he surrendered to the French authorities. Our correspondent in Paris said that the news of Huseini's disappearance is no less noteworthy than the question of who will be the next French president and prime minister. The French Foreign Ministry continues to express ignorance and surprise, and other authorities such as the police and the Ministry of the Interior are also silent. Rumors have it that Huseini's escape was aided by the British government. The "World Daily News" said that Huseini's escape was successful because Paris or London had no real intention of stopping his escape. However, according to well-informed diplomatic sources, the French Foreign Ministry's ignorance seems to be the truth, but the inside story is not known to outsiders. It is not easy to leave France by plane. How could the police and passport authorities know nothing? However, some Allied planes, including

Soviet planes,

Enjoy diplomatic privileges and take off and land at airports near Paris from time to time. When Huseini was in France, he often contacted his Middle Eastern friends. The Egyptian and Syrian embassies were his frequent destinations.

[Reuters, London, 11th] The British Foreign Office has instructed the British Embassy in France to request an explanation from the French government regarding the disappearance of Grand Mufti Huseini of Jerusalem. The British government believes that the French government must be aware of the situation and that this is an "unfriendly act" towards Britain. British diplomatic circles pointed out that the French government is well aware of Britain's attitude towards Huseini. The British government informed the French side a few weeks ago that Huseini's return to the Middle East would be an "unwelcome and dangerous" move, as Huseini might once again organize an Arab army as in 1936.

Resist Britain

The British government does not believe that Huseini could have left France without official permission or collusion with some of the highest-ranking French officials. And although he was nominally under the supervision of the French police, he was actually able to freely contact Arab politicians at will. People close to the British Foreign Office frankly stated that due to the current delicate state of affairs in Palestine, Huseini's return to the Middle East will further complicate the situation.

[Reuters, Paris, 10th] A senior police officer in charge of managing foreigners in France is expected to be dismissed due to the disappearance of the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem. The Grand Mufti may have disguised himself as one of the members of the Arab delegation and mixed out of France. He had been ill recently, or may have pretended to be ill, so that it would be easier to disguise himself.

[United Press, Washington, 10th] The State Department announced today that it would investigate the rumor that the Grand Mufti of Palestine traveled part of the way from France to Syria on a U.S. military transport plane.

### Montgomery Convenes a Meeting of British Officials in Cairo

[Our Newspaper's Report] London, 11th: After arriving in Cairo, British Chief of Staff Marshal Montgomery immediately consulted with senior British personnel and will go to Palestine tomorrow or the day after.

[Reuters, Cairo, 11th] Marshal Montgomery arrived here by plane yesterday afternoon and is scheduled to meet with Egyptian Prime Minister Sidqi this morning. This may be a courtesy visit, but the military situation regarding the British withdrawal will inevitably be discussed.

[Reuters, Cairo, 10th] The Wingate Barracks in Cairo were handed over to the Egyptian army today. The barracks are very large and equipped with shops and classrooms. It is generally believed that this is another indication of the British army's preparation for withdrawal.

### Truman's Visit to the Philippines is Canceled

[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 10th] White House Press Secretary Ross announced today that President Truman had originally planned to visit the Philippines to attend the ceremony for the independence of the Philippines on July 4. This plan has now been canceled, and Secretary of the Interior Krug will go to attend as the President's personal representative.

### Spanish Question: Security Council Postpones Discussion

[United Press, New York, 10th] The President of the United Nations Security Council announced today that the next meeting of the council, originally scheduled for Sunday, tomorrow, to discuss the Spanish question, has now been postponed to Thursday because British Representative Cadogan has not yet received instructions from his government.

### Prime Minister of the Spanish Republican Government Sends a Congratulatory Telegram to Chairman Chiang

[This City's Report] The Prime Minister of the Spanish Republican Government, Giral, recently sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang to congratulate him and to congratulate the Chinese government and its people on the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. It is learned that the telegram was sent to the Spanish Republican Committee here for transmission.

### Siam's New King Bhumibol – Is an Optimistic and Sport-Loving Child – The Death of the Late King Remains a Mystery to the Siamese People

The 18-year-old new King Bhumibol of Siam, according to Siamese people familiar with him, is an optimistic and sport-loving child, and he will soon win the love of 1.8 million subjects.

The Siamese Chargé d'Affaires in the United States stated: The new King of Siam is a child who believes in democracy. He loves sports, and when he was in Switzerland, he practiced skiing.

Bhumibol and the late King Mahidol of Siam went to Switzerland to study together in 1933. They had returned to the country many times during vacations in recent years. After Siam was liberated, Mahidol returned to the country to succeed to the throne. Both of them returned to Bangkok in December of last year.

Speculation from the outside world suggests that the death of the late King Mahidol of Siam was not due to an accidental event. People close to Siam have expressed doubts about this. Although they have not received any information other than the official announcement, Siamese people firmly believe that no foreign or Siamese elements attempted to assassinate the late King Mahidol in order to seize the throne, because his younger brother, the new King of Siam, fully agreed with his policies.

These people stated: The late King Mahidol of Siam suffered from a glandular disease, which caused his height to exceed six feet—a height that is not common among Siamese people.

The remains of the late King will be placed in a golden urn, and a one-and-a-half-hour funeral ceremony will be held, with continuous cannon salutes. His remains will be dressed in full regalia and placed in the Dasiti Urn in the Royal Palace for the people to pay their respects before cremation. The death of the King of Siam remains a mystery to the Siamese people. The official explanation is that the King of Siam died accidentally due to mishandling an American pistol. Some parties do not accept this explanation. They accept the statement that the King of Siam had previously been ill, because he was unable to attend the cremation ceremony of the Chairman of the Regency Council held last Saturday.

### Inspector Cheng Enumerates Facts – Impeaching Grain Loan Malpractice – Proving Collusion Between Officials and Merchants – Yang Xizhi and Others Suspected of Major Embezzlement

The grain loan malpractice case, which has attracted city-wide attention, has been thoroughly investigated by Jiangsu Regional Inspector Cheng Zhongxing. It has been proven that the Grain Administration Office is indeed suspected of collusion between officials and merchants for malpractice. He has listed ten facts and presented them to the Control Yuan for approval to initiate impeachment. The Jiangsu Inspectorate has recently announced the full text of the official letter to the Executive Yuan impeaching Yang Xizhi, Special Commissioner of the Grain Administration Office, Wang Darren, Commissioner concurrently acting as Office Manager, Ren Xingya, Chief of the Regulation Section, and Li Chongnian, Director of the Field Grain Administration and concurrently Special Commissioner of the Southeast Region and Chairman of the Yangtze River Grain Storage and Transportation Committee, for violating the law, dereliction of duty, and for being suspected of major embezzlement:

Regarding the impeachment of Yang Xizhi, Special Commissioner of the Shanghai Grain Administration of the Ministry of Food, Wang Darren, Commissioner of the Ministry of Food concurrently Secretary of the Special Commissioner's Office acting as Office Manager, Ren Xingya, Chief of the Regulation Section, and Li Chongnian, Director of the Field Grain Administration of the Ministry of Food and concurrently Special Commissioner of the Southeast Region and Chairman of the Yangtze River Grain Storage and Transportation Committee, for violating the law and dereliction of duty: It is noted that the price of grain in Shanghai soared last month. Within a few days, the price of rice skyrocketed by more than 30,000 yuan, attracting international attention and causing public grievances to boil over. This has directly harmed people's livelihoods and indirectly damaged the government's credibility. This office dispatched a section chief and several investigators to the Grain Administration Special Commissioner's Office, the Bean and Rice Trade Association, and the companies and firms that undertook grain loans to thoroughly investigate the truth. Based on the consolidated reports, the speculation and hoarding by some unscrupulous merchants is indeed one of the reasons for the fluctuations in the grain market, but the Grain Administration Office's handling of grain loans is suspicious and there are numerous violations, which is a major cause of this grain crisis. The evil of unscrupulous merchants is obvious, but the crime of corruption is hidden and difficult to see. For years, unscrupulous merchants have run rampant, and those who have supported and promoted them are corrupt officials. To eliminate unscrupulous merchants, we must first eliminate corrupt officials. To govern a chaotic country, one must use heavy penalties, and one must punish one to warn a hundred. The main points of the investigation are summarized below:

Ten Key Points

(1) It is found that the total amount of loans is 940 million yuan. In addition to the 40 million yuan undertaken by Fu Kang Rice Firm, the remaining fifteen companies, such as Wan Chang, each borrowed 60 million yuan. Any merchant with the ability to transport and sell rice and grain, even if not a member of the Bean and Rice Trade Association, can apply for a loan. The regulations are too broad, which opens the door for collusion between officials and merchants. Reviewing the process of handling the loans, it seems that various loopholes have been intentionally left, as if there is a tacit agreement. (2) It is found that there are more than 300 rice firms and 1,800 rice shops in Shanghai, many of which have solid capital and a long history. However, the capital amount of the sixteen firms approved by the Grain Administration Office to undertake grain loans is mostly between 4 and 5 million yuan. Even firms such as Xin Chang and Xie Changtai have only about 1 million yuan in capital, and Yong Shuntai, with 500,000 yuan in capital, undertook a huge loan of 60 million yuan. Fu Kang is a newly opened rice firm, and its internal structure seems to be a temporary organization. The Grain Administration Office did not examine these firms carefully and approved them, which violates the resolution of the first meeting of the Review Panel and is suspected of major collusion and private gain. (3) It is found that Wan Changxin and Wan Chang are opened by the same shop owner, Wan Molin. Xing Zhigang, the owner of Chengfeng Rice Firm, borrowed the name of Wan Changxin to come forward and undertake the grain loan, which is not what a legitimate businessman should do. Zhifeng mainly deals in miscellaneous grains, and it is difficult to determine whether it has the ability to transport and sell rice and grain. As for the Jiangbei Company, its business scope originally included the purchase, transportation, processing, and export of Jiangbei local products, as well as Jiangbei agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, industrial, and mining enterprises. Although it filled in the establishment of the Ministry of Food in its grain loan application, it has never purchased, transported, or sold rice and grain. Since it is not a member of the Bean and Rice Trade Association, its ability to transport and sell rice and grain is also questionable. This is clearly inconsistent with the provisions of Article 2 of the loan method. (4) It is found that the Grain Administration Office designated eight firms, including Wan Chang, which are operated by directors of the Bean and Rice Trade and members of the Miscellaneous Grain Reorganization Committee, to be submitted by the Chamber of Commerce. Wan Molin, Chairman of the Bean and Rice Trade Association, introduced Zhifeng, Xie Changtai, Huifeng, and Heng Taifeng. The Ministry of Food, through Li Chongnian, Director of the Field Grain Administration and concurrently Chairman of the Yangtze River Grain Storage and Transportation Committee, introduced the Changjiang, Jiangbei, and Tongyi Companies to be submitted by Wan Molin. Fu Kang Rice Firm was secretly negotiated by the Grain Administration Office and its manager Shao Ligao and entrusted to Wan Molin for submission, which is clearly suspected of collusion between officials and merchants with the intention of making profits. On the surface, it was approved by the Review Panel, but the amount of grain submitted for review, with sixteen applicants, and sixteen approved, applicants did not have multiple applicants or excess amounts, so that reviewers could have strict selection to the option. Moreover, during the review, the applicant firm and the review committee sat in the same room, making it impossible for the review committee to freely express their opinions. According to the investigation, most of the sixteen firms applying for grain loans were

pre-arranged and set up in advance by the Grain Administration Office,

and then submitted by the association or chamber of commerce. The review was merely a formality, and the collusion and manipulation were very obvious. Wang Darren, the acting manager of the Grain Administration Office who presided over the meeting, and Ren Xingya, the Chief of the Regulation Section, should be held responsible. (5) It is found that most of the purchasing areas of the grain loan merchants are in Wuxi, Suzhou, Changshu, Kunshan, Qingpu, and Songjiang. These places are close to Shanghai. When they heard the news of the grain loans, they first raised the price of rice. Later, due to large-scale purchases from outside, the price of rice in various places rose sharply day by day. The establishment of grain loans was originally intended to enrich the food supply for the people of Shanghai (Article 1 of the Grain Merchants Loan Method), but in fact, as a result of its implementation, the food supply for the people of Shanghai has become even more difficult due to the poor management of the Grain Administration Office. The food supply for the people in the neighboring counties of Shanghai has also suffered from high prices. The Grain Administration Office did not carefully consider the purchasing areas in advance, and it was also indifferent afterwards, allowing merchants and the people to freely purchase grain, allowing the food supply for the people in the neighboring counties of Shanghai to undergo sudden changes. The food supply for the people of Shanghai must be enriched, but should the food supply for the people outside of Shanghai be ignored? In the end, the price of rice in Shanghai and its neighboring counties rose at the same time. The principle of establishing grain loans was not carefully considered, and during its implementation, there was even

selfish intent.

The responsible personnel of the Grain Administration Office should all be held responsible for negligence and private gain. (6) It is found that the rice purchased by Changjiang Company from Fengjing, Songjiang, Nanjing, and other places arrived in Shanghai as early as April 24 and May 4, but the starting date of sales was May 15. The rice and grain arrived in Shanghai for ten days, but it was not sold in the market. The company's existing grain still has 956 dan and 3 dou, and 950 bags, some of which are brown rice that arrived in Shanghai after May 20. The company delayed processing and selling the brown rice after it was transported, and it is difficult to understand what its intentions were. This is one point. The selling prices of the rice transported to Shanghai by various grain merchants varied, and most did not follow the resolution of the Review Committee to depreciate the price by 2,000 yuan according to the closing market price of every other day. This is the second point. After receiving the loans, some firms, such as Changjiang Company, Xie Changtai, and Huifeng, did not immediately set out to purchase grain. Firms such as Wan Chang and Zhifeng purchased and sold rice in Shanghai, but the proceeds were not immediately deposited in the lending bank. It is also found that the loan checks of Jiangbei Company had stubs for payments to Ling Ziwen and Wang Zuqi of the Frontline Daily, totaling around 20 million yuan, which is suspected of using the loan for other purposes. This is the third point. Such cases are too numerous to mention, but the Grain Administration Office, which is responsible for supervision and assessment, did not intervene, and it is undeniable that it has neglected its duties. (7) It is found that in late April, when the price of rice was gradually rising, the Grain Administration Office, on the pretext of disputes in the market, directly ordered the suspension of sales of rice purchased with grain loans, which lasted for more than ten days, accumulating as much as 17,000 dan of rice, causing other grain merchants to adopt a wait-and-see attitude. The market had demand but no supply, and the price of rice soared as a result. (Note: On April 26, the price of thin rice was 35,000 yuan per dan, and by May 11, it had reached 48,000 yuan.) Its improper handling is obvious. (8) It is found that when applying for loans, each grain loan merchant had to pay a review fee of 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. The loan method approved by the Ministry of Food did not have this provision, which is clearly establishing a pretext to seek profit and is suspected of major embezzlement. (9) The total amount of grain loans is 940 million yuan, but the interest collected is only 3% per month. The national treasury spends such huge sums of money to organize grain loans, but the personnel in charge of grain administration cannot appreciate the difficulties of the national finances or alleviate the hardships of the people. They take advantage of the opportunity to

squander national funds and harm people's livelihoods.

Their intentions and actions are not tolerated by the law. (10) Although Yang Xizhi, the Special Commissioner of the Shanghai Grain Administration, has now gone abroad, the decision to organize grain loans and various operations were all planned by him before he went abroad. The personnel executing the grain loans were also appointed by him. After he went abroad, the affairs of the Special Commissioner's Office were actually managed by Wang Darren, the secretary of the office. All kinds of grain loans were also handled by him, carrying on the work from above and passing it on below. Ren Xingya, the Chief of the Regulation Section, was the one who actually carried out the work. When the loans were approved, criticism and attacks were already very fierce, but the authorities of the Grain Administration Office dared to ignore this and acted without any scruples. What is Wang Darren relying on to be so fearless, and who is the mastermind behind him? This concerns the governance and chaos of the country. Foxes and wolves should be punished equally, otherwise, it is not enough to rectify the root and clear the source.

In summary, Yang Xizhi, Special Commissioner of the Shanghai Grain Administration, Wang Darren, Commissioner of the Ministry of Food concurrently Secretary of the Shanghai Special Commissioner's Office acting as Office Manager, Ren Xingya, Chief of the Regulation Section, and Li Chongnian, Director of the Field Grain Administration of the Ministry of Food and concurrently Special Commissioner of the Southeast Region and Chairman of the Yangtze River Grain Storage and Transportation Committee, used their authority to collude with merchants, causing a grain crisis in Shanghai and harming people's livelihoods. They have violated the law, derelicted their duties, and are suspected of major embezzlement. In accordance with the provisions of Article 2, Paragraph 1 of the revised Provisional Measures for the Exercise of Supervisory Powers in Extraordinary Times, we are submitting this to the Control Yuan for approval to initiate impeachment. In addition to the above-mentioned personnel and the relevant grain merchants, whose cases involve criminal aspects and will be transferred to the court for investigation, we hope that you will investigate and handle the case in accordance with the law and provide a response on the handling situation. To the Executive Yuan. Cheng Zhongxing, Inspector of the Jiangsu Supervisory District of the Control Yuan.

### Citywide ID Card Issuance to Be Completed Before Mid-Month

[Report from this newspaper] According to the Civil Affairs Department of the Municipal Government: The National Identification Cards for the 30 districts of the city have mostly been issued.

However, it is hoped that all matters can be completed before the 15th of this month.

### Jin Zhuan Case Under Interrogation – Managers of Chongqing Bank and Others Detained and Released on Bail Separately

[Report from this newspaper] The central bank's massive theft case, due to the detention of gold bricks, has implicated Shanghai Bank, Chongqing Bank, Qintai Money Shop, and Xinda Stock Company. The inside story is complicated. After the case was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office, the Ministry of Finance also attached great importance to it. In view of the fact that the relevant banks and money shops have arbitrarily detained gold bricks and debt securities, which violates financial regulations and is illegal, a special order was issued for a thorough investigation. The District Prosecutor's Office summoned all relevant banks and money shops the afternoon before yesterday for the first investigative hearing, which lasted for several hours. It was believed that Wu Minggang, Manager of the Shanghai Branch of Chongqing Bank, Pan Jialiu, Head of the Business Section and Assistant Manager of Shanghai Bank, Wang Jiamei, person in charge of Xinda Stock Company, and others were suspected of serious crimes and were detained. As for Zhu Zhifei, General Manager of the Shanghai Branch of Chongqing Bank, the part about altering the accounts was not related to this case, so he was allowed to leave on bail. Yu Shiyang of Qintai Money Shop was ordered to pay a cash bail of 2 million yuan.

### Grain Administration Office Ordered to Be Abolished – Shanghai Storage and Transportation Office to Be Established

[Report from this newspaper] It is learned that the Shanghai Grain Administration Special Commissioner's Office has recently received an order from the Ministry of Food to be abolished immediately, and all outstanding matters must be completed by the end of June. The Ministry of Food has decided that the control of grain matters in Shanghai should be entrusted to the Social Affairs Bureau of the Shanghai Municipal Government upon request, and the collection of field tax should be entrusted to the Finance Bureau. As for the receipt and dispatch of military grain, the supervision and management of grain processing factories, and other receipt and dispatch businesses related to grain and food in Shanghai, the Shanghai Grain Storage and Transportation Office will be established to handle these matters. It is also learned that Yang Xizhi has been appointed as the Director of the Storage and Transportation Office, and Ye Xinming and Wang Darren as the Deputy Directors.

### Demobilized Youth Army – Guangdong Team Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday – Fujian Team to Return to Fujian Today

[Report from this newspaper] The second batch of demobilized youth army, the Guangdong Brigade, with 2,300 people, including seven women, led by Commander Tu Chengqing, arrived in Shanghai from Hangzhou at 1:00 p.m. yesterday. The crowd welcoming them at the North Station was even more enthusiastic than before.

### Welcome Rally for the First Batch of Youth Army

[Report from this newspaper] The welcome rally for the first batch of demobilized youth army to arrive in Shanghai, organized by various circles in the city, was held at the Majestic Theatre at 8:00 a.m. yesterday. More than 2,000 officers and soldiers attended, and representatives from various circles included Mayor Wu Guozhen, Zhuang Heren from the Municipal Party Headquarters, Fu Tongguang from the Municipal Provisional Assembly, and Wang Xiaolai from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. After the formalities were completed, the mayor gave a speech, stating that the youth army was established at the most critical time for the country. You were able to give up your pens for swords and were willing to sacrifice. Today, I would like to extend my highest respect on behalf of all the citizens of Shanghai. You may regret not being able to kill the enemy on the battlefield, but from the government's standpoint, we are not willing to see you sacrifice easily, because you are all the most outstanding cadres and are the best foundation for establishing a future conscription system. At present, the atmosphere in Shanghai is one of extravagance, and the general public lacks a sense of national identity and national consciousness. During your stay in Shanghai, I hope that you can demonstrate the revolutionary spirit of the new army everywhere, "Live for the flag of the Blue Sky and White Sun, and die for the flag of the Blue Sky and White Sun," to set an example for all the citizens of Shanghai and correct the bad atmosphere. After the speech, Ms. Wang Weiwei of the Student Federation, representing various circles, presented flowers to all officers and soldiers to pay tribute. Then, Zhuang Heren of the Party Headquarters and Fu Tongxian of the Provisional Assembly gave speeches one after another. Huang Huaijin, a student of Xiehe University and representative of the Youth Army, gave a reply, expressing gratitude for the generous hospitality of various circles, and said that they would work hard on national construction to complete the new China of the Three Principles of the People. Finally, the entertainment began, with Deng Guoqing's artistic performances and the screening of the China Electric Company's new film "Return My Hometown." It ended happily at 12:30 p.m.

### Murder Without Fear of Bloodshed: Foreman Becomes Rogue – Old Thief Chang Yuqing on Trial, Hypocritically Recites Buddhist Sutras While Clasping Hands, Feigns Deafness and Dumbness, Shirking All Responsibility – Judge Xiao Angrily Rebukes

[Our Reporter] During the early stages of the War of Resistance, anyone living in Shanghai, which had recently fallen, would have shuddered at the mention of the "Huangdao Society." Before their eyes would appear eight heads hanging from telephone poles, blood dripping from their necks, their faces displaying indescribable horror. Attached to these heads were slips of paper, written in bright red (perhaps the blood of patriots!), bearing eight frightening characters: "See, the fate of patriots!" This atrocity, only conceivable by despotic monarchs, once disturbed the hearts of the people. Yet Chang Yuqing, the chief traitor who led the "Huangdao Society" in brutally killing patriotic heroes, is now finally being brought to justice in our national court.

Chang, a native of Jiangling, Hubei, is sixty-two years old. Before the war, he was merely a foreman in the Shanghai cotton mills of Japanese companies Toyota, Tongxing, and Dakang, as well as the chairman of the Huangpu Bund ironworkers' union. Starting in 1937, he colluded with Japanese aggressors Xichuan Dabao, Fu Xiaoan, and others to form a "Maintenance Society," but failed. He then conspired with Japanese ronin Takahashi Kamii and Xu Fei, a liaison for the Japanese military, to organize the "Huangdao Society," using the New Asia Hotel on Sichuan Road as their headquarters. They committed all kinds of evil deeds, creating an unprecedented reign of terror in Shanghai. Even Liang Hongzhi, the leader of the "Reform Government," disapproved of his actions, leading him to flee to Nanjing to form the "Anqing Gang," recruiting followers and continuing to serve as a pawn for the enemy.

During the trial yesterday morning, the traitor Chang wore a blue silk long gown, with his sleeves rolled up to reveal a white shirt underneath. He wore black cloth shoes, and his thumb moved incessantly as he spoke, maintaining the style of a "street hustler." However, he walked as if he were shackled, claiming to have kidney problems. When answering questions, he feigned deafness and dumbness, deliberately misinterpreting the judge's questions. He spent a full seven minutes on the single question of whether he had been a "foreman," infuriating Judge Xiao. As for the charge of instigating the "Huangdao Society" to commit murder, he denied it completely, saying, "I am a vegetarian who worships Buddha and is afraid even to kill a chicken. How could I kill people? Besides, I am so fat and cannot even walk properly." As he spoke, he clasped his hands in a show of false piety. Judge Xiao immediately rebuked him, saying, "Liang Hongzhi is your comrade. He acknowledges your deeds and even expresses disapproval. Are you still denying it?" Chang paused briefly and quietly said, "If that is what he says, there is nothing I can do." But Judge Xiao went further, saying, "Millions of people in Shanghai know of your crimes and say that you committed the murders. They have no feud with you. Why would they accuse you if it were not true!" Chang stammered and could not answer for a long time, finally mumbling, "I have never done anything against my conscience." After the court thoroughly questioned him about the crimes listed in the indictment, they decided to postpone the hearing. The defendant was remanded into custody. As the traitor Chang walked out of the courtroom, he reversed his earlier feigned illness and stamped his feet, protesting unfairly that the judge did not allow him to speak, but the bailiffs quickly escorted him back to prison.

### Puppet Rice Control Committee Chairman Chen Guoquan Retried Yesterday

The Executive Yuan has appointed Xu Shihao and Chen Shouchang as review committee members. Both attended the committee's 90th meeting yesterday. The meeting also passed resolutions: (1) In future auctions of factories, a maximum of the top three bids will be retained, and the remaining deposits will be returned. (2) The entire assets of Haiyong Jinbing Mining Company will be returned. (3) The machinery of the British Electrical Music Experimental Company will be returned.

### A Mystery Amidst the Disputes in the Barber Industry: The Missing Zhao Guiliang Has Returned

[Our Reporter] Amidst the labor-management disputes in the barber industry, Dai Xingqing, the branch secretary of the union, was stabbed and injured on the evening of the 1st of this month, and Zhao Guiliang went missing. Subsequently, the Lao Zha Branch Bureau, based on the union's testimony, alleged that the management was responsible and detained Sun Yuming, the owner of Datong Barber Shop, and Chen Yuanfu, the owner of Huzhong Barber Shop, for investigation by the District Procuratorate. At the same time, Gao Deyu, the chairman of the union, accompanied Zhao's mother and wife to request the authorities to thoroughly investigate the matter. However, Jiang Shangpei, the section chief, and Feng Xiushan, the staff member of the Lao Zha Police Bureau, received a tip-off that Zhao Guiliang was hiding in the home of Gong Wenxiang's son-in-law at No. 11, Cheng Gelao Lane, Hongwu Road, Nanjing. They immediately sent personnel to Beijing, where they cooperated with the Capital Police Bureau to arrest Zhao and bring him back to Shanghai yesterday. The truth of the case will soon be revealed.

### Claiming to Represent Cleaners: Soldier Chen Erjin Detained for Investigation

[Our Reporter] A man named Chen Erjin, claiming to be a colonel of artillery in the First War Zone Command and currently the director of the Shanghai branch of the Northwest News Agency, yesterday morning carried a petition with the signatures of more than 1,370 cleaners from the East, South, West, North, Zhabei, and Hexi districts of this city to the municipal government to meet with Mayor Wu. He claimed to be the general representative of cleaners from various districts of the city, requesting an order to improve their treatment. The mayor, noting that Chen was a soldier and a journalist, questioned how he could serve as the general representative of cleaners, which seemed like a fraudulent act. He ordered Chen's detention and telegraphed the First War Zone Command to inquire whether there was such a person as Chen, pending a response before taking action.

### Families of Victims of the Haitong Shipwreck Demand Compensation Without Result

### The District Court Tried the Seductive Corpse Case Yesterday: Lin Buwu Claims It Was an Accidental Firing, Denies Enmity with the Deceased Chen Huifang

[Our Reporter] The sensational Taishan Apartment "Seductive Corpse" case, which was previously investigated and prosecuted by the District Procuratorate, was tried yesterday morning in the District Court by Judge Cao. The defendant, Lin Buwu, claimed that he had no relationship or enmity with the deceased, Chen Huifang. He stated that the reason he killed her was due to an accidental firing. He said that on March 10th, he and Chen went to Paris to see a movie but were unsuccessful. They then went to Taishan Apartment to visit a friend, Jin Debiao. Chen behaved arrogantly and went straight to the rooftop balcony. Lin then took out a gun to scare her, resulting in an accidental firing and her death. Wang Zhengzhong testified that he was behind Lin and Chen when they went to the rooftop that day. When he went up, Chen was already lying in a pool of blood. After a thorough interrogation, the court ordered the defendant remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing for the 20th.

### June 18th "Dragon Ball": Australian Overseas Chinese Live Well, Annual Grand Ball, Proceeds Donated to National Relief, Interview with Madam Zheng

"There are a total of 11,000 overseas Chinese in Australia. Although many of them have lived abroad for a long time and do not fully understand China's current situation, the overseas Chinese in Australia have never forgotten their motherland and are particularly concerned about the suffering of their compatriots. The amount of money they contribute to the country each year is enormous," said Madam Chen Leyi, wife of Zheng Yitong, the ambassador to Australia, when talking to reporters about the situation of overseas Chinese in Australia yesterday.

Zheng Yitong was ordered to serve as the ambassador to Australia in August last year. He returned to China last month to attend important meetings in the wartime capital. Madam Zheng accompanied him to Shanghai. She will take her two sons back to Australia within the next week, and four other sons and daughters have already gone to Australia last year. Madam Zheng is from Hangzhou and speaks fluent Shanghainese and English.

Madam Zheng told reporters that overseas Chinese in Australia always hold a grand ball every year on June 18th, which they call the "Dragon Ball." Invitations are sent to various places three months before the event, showing how much they value this annual event. But they are not just having fun; the proceeds from the tickets for this ball are entirely sent back to China each year and given to Madam Chiang for relief efforts. The opening ceremony is usually hosted by the ambassador and his wife. This year, because Ambassador Zheng still has official business to attend to, he cannot return in time to host it, so Madam Zheng is eager to return to Australia, also for this matter.

Most of the overseas Chinese in Australia are from Guangdong or Fujian. They ship handicrafts such as lace and embroidery to Australia for sale, and their businesses are doing very well. Australia produces a large amount of fruit and flowers, but to buy the most beautifully decorated flowers or fruit, you have to go to the shops run by overseas Chinese.

The British and local people in Australia are quite friendly to the overseas Chinese. However, for policy reasons, they do not welcome large numbers of immigrants. (Our reporter, Mai Tian) (Ambassador Zheng and his wife are pictured above)

### Jiaozuo Institute of Technology: Restoration Funds Not Secured, Appeals for Support from All Parties

[Dispatch from Kaifeng by Dahuashe News Agency] Jiaozuo Institute of Technology, a well-known school of engineering and mining in our country, was founded by the Zhongfu Coal Mine. In 1938, it was ordered to move to Tianshui and merged with the engineering colleges of Dongda, Pingda, and Beiyang to form the Northwest Institute of Technology. After the victory, the Ministry of Education approved its restoration. However, the operating expenses of the school are subsidized by the Zhongfu United Office, the Henan Provincial Government, the Gengkuan Committee, and the Ministry of Education respectively. Now that the restoration is imminent, but the Zhongfu Coal Mine has not yet started operations, and the support from other parties has not been determined. This has caused the school's restoration preparatory committee great hesitation. It is estimated that the cost of relocation and other expenses will be about 110 million yuan, and the annual operating expenses will be 60 million yuan, but there is no funding. Therefore, it can only appeal to all parties in the country to provide strong support to cultivate talents for the country.

### Female Normal School Students Give Up Profits for Reputation

Donating Funds to the School to Purchase Books

[Hankou News] The Hubei Provincial First Female Normal School has resumed operations.

The school principal, in order to resolve the issue of these additional 4,000 yuan in travel expenses, convened a meeting with the students and asked them whether they valued reputation or profit. If they valued profit, they could keep the money; if they valued reputation, they could donate it to the school to purchase books. The students, considering that 4,000 yuan was not of great use, decided to give up profits for reputation and donate the money to the school to purchase books.

### Jiang Weiqiao, President of Chengming College, Cares for Refugees in Northern Jiangsu

Donates All 130,000 Yuan of Conference Funds for Relief

[Our Correspondent in This City] Jiang Weiqiao, President of Chengming College of Arts and Sciences, recently went to Zhenjiang to attend the Jiangsu Provincial Provisional Assembly. Witnessing the plight of refugees from Northern Jiangsu, he donated all 130,000 yuan of his conference funds for relief. It is reported that upon returning to Shanghai, he will continue to solicit donations for the refugees in Northern Jiangsu. In other news, the original location of Chengming College on Jiaotong Road was illegally sold and occupied, and it is reported that legal action has been taken. The college is the only independent college of arts and sciences in this city. During the War of Resistance, it repeatedly relocated.

Currently, to meet the needs of national reconstruction, the college will expand its departments next semester and is submitting a request to the Ministry of Education for approval.

### The Ministry of Education Orders Chengming College Faculty and Students to Withdraw from the Bethany Orphanage

[Our Correspondent in This City] The Bethany Orphanage on Zhabei Datong Road was founded by Pastor Qian, and is one of the most well-managed and idealistic charitable institutions in Shanghai. During the occupation of this city, the orphanage secretly took in comrades sought by the enemy police and refused any rations such as flour from the puppet regime, demonstrating great righteousness, which is especially commendable. The Zhabei site was purchased from the private property of Wang Xishen. Chengming College, due to its connection with Zhengfeng, requested to take over the orphanage and filed a lawsuit, while also instructing dozens of faculty and students to forcibly invade, disrupting the peace of the orphanage and leading to housing disputes for several months. In the initial trial, Chengming lost the case because the orphanage's contract procedures and evidence were confirmed. However, the students of Chengming University, relying on the so-called "fait accompli," remained in front of hundreds of orphans, refusing to leave. The Ministry of Education is also very concerned about this matter. After investigating the truth, it has ordered all faculty and students of Chengming College occupying the houses to withdraw.

### Elementary School Curriculum Research Session (V) - English Should Not Be Included in the Elementary School Curriculum

I am a layman when it comes to drafting elementary school curriculum standards, but I believe that the inclusion of English in the curriculum of elementary school third grade in Shanghai (although not stipulated in the curriculum standards) is worthy of research and discussion. Elementary education is the basic education of citizens. Students in elementary school third grade are usually under the age of ten. They have not been in school for long, and they only have a superficial understanding of their native language. According to the current elementary school curriculum, in addition to Chinese, there are also subjects such as arithmetic, general knowledge, and civics. This is already quite burdensome for a child under ten years old. If we add an English course, how can they digest it? It is common to see students review their homework after school, switching between Chinese and English, feeling dizzy and frustrated. As a result, due to limited brainpower, they gain little from English, while the foundation of Chinese is not well established due to the heavy workload. The recent widespread decline in the Chinese proficiency of elementary school students is a clear proof. I believe that the standard for drafting elementary school curriculum should be based on the basic subjects that students can intellectually grasp. To cultivate students' physical fitness, the curriculum should not be too heavy. There is absolutely no need to include English in the elementary school curriculum. Although English is quite important for employment as an adult, it can be included as a subject from the first grade of junior high school, which is not too late for those who have the opportunity to receive secondary education. I believe this is not only my personal opinion, but probably also the voice of most parents! (Lu Gongwu, 35, 6, 10, at the Shanghai Jiaotong Bank.)

### The Hong Kong Eastern Allied Forces Change to a New Formation to Face the Dark Horse Jewish Team Today at 5:30 PM at the Yiyuan Stadium

The Hong Kong Eastern Allied Football Team, on their expedition to Shanghai, easily defeated the British Navy 6-0 in their first match and cleverly captured the Western Allied team 4-1 in their second match. Their momentum is unmatched for a time. The Eastern team is full of energy, with excellent passing, good offense and defense, and superior ball skills. Shanghai fans are enthusiastically supporting them. Today at 5:30 PM, the team will play their third match against the Jewish team, known as the Dark Horse, at the Yiyuan Stadium on Shaanxi South Road. Ticket prices remain the same and will be sold at the Municipal Stadium starting at 3:00 PM. The referee is Jiang Yinseng, and the linesmen are Chen Jixiang and Jin Jiabiao.

Today, the Eastern Allied team is deploying a new formation. According to Captain Xu Jingcheng, except for goalkeeper Zhu Zhaohong, who remains unchanged, Captain Xu will switch to left back, Huo Yaohua will take the position of center back, Guo Yingqi will be the commander, and Feng Jingxiang and Li Zhaorong will take a short break today to conserve their energy for the battle with Donghua the day after tomorrow. With Captain Xu's presence on the defense, it will be even more solid. Huo Yuehua's center back position will surely be all-encompassing. Zhang Jinhai's move to the right, supplemented by Guo Yingqi's central army, will not reduce the offensive power, and Guo's iron leg is admired by all. Today, facing the Jewish team, it will not be difficult to win in one go.

The Jewish team's lineup has also been arranged to cope with the visiting team. The Jewish team, known as the Dark Horse, has a fighting force that is unpredictable. Oliveira, the center back, is unmatched in Shanghai, with both offense and defense being just right. In addition, the veteran Di Fei is making a comeback, partnering with Da Chong Fafanxiao, which can be described as a perfect match. Lai Fan will assist on the left (but W. Pantunson may come off the bench). Lai Liao will retreat as a fresh force. The strength of the lineup has been increased by this change, but it is still feared that it will be difficult to defeat the expeditionary army. The lineups of the two armies today are recorded below:

Eastern Allied Forces

Zhu Zhaohong

Xu Jingcheng Hou Rongsheng

Luo Weiquan Huo Yaohua Feng Kunsheng

Li Shuoyou Liu Songsheng Guo Yingqi Zhang Jinhai Deng Guangsen

(Fresh Force) Feng Jingxiang Li Zhaorong

### The Ministry of Education Plans to Establish an International Cultural and Educational Affairs Department

In the first group, French national player Bertram, who is six feet seven inches tall and shaped like a pagoda, met South African Mitić. After two hours and fifty-five minutes of fierce battle, Bertram defeated Mitić 4-6, 8-6, 6-4, 3-6, and 8-6. In the second group, French Bernat played South African Ponke. At the beginning of the match, Bernat performed poorly and lost the first set. He only started to perform wonderfully after the second set. The scores were 2-6, 6-1, 0-6, 7-5 (the fifth set is unknown). The two teams are scheduled to hold the doubles group competition tomorrow. The competition is very important and the lineup has not yet been announced.

### Discussions on Governing the Yellow River (1)

— Chu Tongan

This article was written by Mr. Chu Tongan after reading Mr. Yang Mengming's "Turning Water Calamities into Water Benefits" published in this newspaper on May 10th. Mr. Chu has studied water conservancy for many years, widely consulted various books, and incorporated practical experience from field investigations. The points listed in the article largely complement Mr. Yang's article. Therefore, we are urgently publishing it for the reference of relevant authorities and domestic Yellow River management experts. ——Editor

The Yellow River, the Yellow River, this great river that has plagued the Central Plains for thousands of years, every time it floods and breaches its banks, the raging torrents swallow countless people and livestock and destroy immense wealth. How can this untamable venomous dragon be subdued? How can its harmful aspects be turned into beneficial ones? This is the most urgent and concerning issue in our country's current revitalization and construction. Now, based on my limited knowledge, I offer some suggestions, hoping that knowledgeable and virtuous individuals in the country will discuss them.

(A) Reasons for Yellow River Floods and Breaches

To manage the Yellow River, the first thing to do is to understand the reasons for its floods and breaches, and then prescribe the right remedy for treatment. Now, I analyze the reasons as follows:

(1) Overly Loose Soil: The Yellow River basin is a vast loess plateau, extending north to Suiyuan and west to Shaanxi and Gansu. For thousands of years, the harsh winds from the northern desert have blown countless fine sands into this area. These fine sands have accumulated year after year, forming the thick loess layer of today. However, this type of soil is very loose and easily eroded by water. Therefore, the Yellow River flowing through this area naturally carries a large amount of sediment into its riverbed, resulting in excessive sediment accumulation. Furthermore, due to the lack of firmness of the soil, dikes and embankments built with it are prone to collapse.

(2) Uneven Terrain: The Yellow River originates from Xingxiu Lake and flows through the mountainous areas of the upper reaches. Below Zhongwei, it gradually enters the plains, and the flow becomes slower. At the Tuoketuo River mouth in Suiyuan, it turns south and passes through the Qinpu Mountains. Within 700 li, confined by the mountains, it descends 800 feet, resulting in a very rapid flow. Passing the Zhuti Mountains, it drops another 200 feet, making the flow even more turbulent. However, from Mengjin down to the sea, the river flows for over 2,000 li through the vast North China loess plain. The terrain is flat, with Mengjin less than 100 feet above sea level. Naturally, the river flow is slow and meandering, and sediment easily accumulates in the riverbed, gradually leading to a situation where the riverbed is higher than the surrounding land. Both overly rapid and overly slow river flows contribute to water disasters.

(3) Lack of Forests and Lakes in the Entire Basin for Water Storage and Discharge: Originally, there were abundant forests in the Yin Mountains, the Wen Mountains, and the northern parts of Shaanxi and Gansu. However, due to excessive deforestation over the years, there are no longer any significant forests in Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, Suiyuan, and Shanxi. These areas are now barren mountains and bald ridges, unable to retain water. Furthermore, the entire basin is a loess area formed by windblown sand, lacking any lakes to store and discharge the Yellow River's water. As a result, the entire basin's rainfall can only be accommodated by the Yellow River itself, without any regulation.

(4) Influence of Climate: The climate in the Yellow River basin is continental. Rainfall is usually very scarce, and in April and May, there are often prolonged droughts. However, due to excessive heat in the summer (indoor temperatures sometimes reaching over 100 degrees), combined with the invasion of southern monsoons, the moisture in the air increases. When cold winds from the northern high pressure system invade in late summer and early autumn, heavy rains occur, often lasting for several days and covering the entire basin. These heavy rains fall on the loess barren mountains, instantly turning dry mountain streams into torrents with extremely high flow rates, with water volumes differing by hundreds of times. Once this widespread floodwater flows into the Yellow River, the river cannot withstand it, leading to breaches and floods that are beyond control.

Now we can observe the Yellow River's water disasters: We know that "river disasters" often occur in the "downstream" section. At Mengjin, the Yellow River is about three li wide. From there downwards, the river is about five li wide in narrow sections and about ten li wide in wide sections. However, the riverbed where the Yellow River regularly flows is only a few dozen zhang wide and less than a xun zhang deep. With this water flow, there should not be any water disasters. However, when widespread heavy rains occur in most of the basin, the phenomenon of "autumn floods arriving suddenly, with hundreds of rivers flowing into the river" occurs. Furthermore, due to the constricting effect of places like Zhuti Mountain, the flow becomes even more turbulent. With such a riverbed experiencing a sudden increase in flow of dozens or hundreds of times in an instant, combined with a very surging and turbulent flow, eroding the loess-built riverbanks, collapses and breaches are naturally very easy to occur. In fact, not only the Yellow River, but also smaller rivers in the north can often cause water disasters. For example, the Luo River, a tributary of the Yellow River, which sometimes has no water, once flooded Yanshi County, simply because of two consecutive days of heavy rain. Heavy rain without forests and lakes to store and regulate water is the main cause of the Yellow River's water disasters. Sediment deposition in the riverbed, rising river levels, loose soil, and unstable embankments are secondary causes of the Yellow River's breaches.

(B) My Views on Managing the Yellow River

(1) Comparison of the Management of the Yangtze River and the Yellow River: Understanding the reasons for the Yellow River's floods and breaches allows us to formulate a management plan. Now, let's compare the Yellow River and the Yangtze River. The Yangtze River is not without its disadvantages. The Yangtze River has the Three Gorges, just as the Yellow River has the Zhuti Mountains, and the water flow is equally rapid. The lowlands of the Chu region - the Yunmeng Plain - are like the vast plains of the lower Yellow River, so thousands of li of long dikes have been built to protect against it. However, the Yangtze River's water level difference is not as severe as the Yellow River's, and it has large lakes such as Dongting Lake and Poyang Lake to regulate water volume, so there are no serious water disasters. However, recently, Dongting Lake has become increasingly silted up, so the areas around the two lakes often experience floods. Recently, the American hydraulic expert Dr. Savage came to investigate the Yangtze River's water conservancy. He believes that building a sluice gate at the Three Gorges west of Yichang, creating a narrow and long artificial lake in the Three Gorges area, would not only regulate the Yangtze River's upstream water volume but also permanently eliminate the floods in the Chu region, even if Dongting Lake were completely silted up. Furthermore, this water power could be used to generate a large amount of electricity, which could be widely supplied to the entire Central China region, electrifying agriculture and industry. This would transform the harmful parts of the Yangtze River into the most beneficial parts. Although it would require an investment of $1.3 billion, this investment could likely be recovered with interest in a very short time with ample surplus. This shows that using the technology of building sluice gates to create "artificial lakes" can not only regulate water volume but also utilize its water power for electricity generation. Then, based on the Yellow River's water volume during floods, if a suitable location can be found to build a sluice gate, could this not also turn harmful aspects into beneficial ones? But where is the most suitable location? (To be continued)

### In Last Night's Dream

### Scattered Notes from Prison (3)

— Yao Falcon

Revelation of Life

Every day, after getting up in the morning, I take a small bamboo stool and sit by the inner courtyard of the prison, looking up at the strip of blue sky, about three chi wide and three zhang long, quietly watching the sunlight projected onto the top of the brick wall, three or four zhang high, slowly move down. Several sparrows chirp and play in the corner of the wall, sometimes whispering to each other, sometimes spreading their wings and flying together, and sometimes taking advantage of people's inattention to swoop down, pick up a grain of leftover rice, and fly back to their nests to feed their young chicks.

After some time, there are several small sparrows following their parents to learn to fly.

In this prison, the only living creatures that can be seen, besides these sparrows, are a pair of Angora rabbits. These are probably kept by the warden or one of the guards, but I never see their owner taking care of them. They spend all day with their red eyes open, covered in soft, long, white fur, jumping back and forth inside and outside the wooden fence, picking up the leftover prison rations we drop.

These are two naughty fellows. They run around everywhere, sniffing and digging, wanting to eat everything, especially at night, when they refuse to settle down. They even steal the extra dishes that the inmates have secretly added, knocking over the bowls covering them. In the morning, we find that they have dragged our shoes into their burrows.

However, they are not scolded. In this prison, these two small lives are treated with love and favor. The inmates treat them as treasures, hugging and stroking them when they have time, or squatting down, pursing their lips and making "you you" sounds to tease them, and even sharing their meager food with them. Their lives are the subject of unusual concern.

Not long ago, one day, we found them digging a hole in the corner of the wall near the toilet. The hole was very well made. They used their hind feet to smooth out the soil piled up at the entrance on the ground, so that people would not easily notice the traces. The inside of the hole was lined with rice straw they had carried and fine fur shed from their bodies, but not even a blade of grass could be seen at the entrance. But finally, we discovered it. Upon inspection, we found that they had already given birth to a pair of small cubs, whose eyes were already open and whose fur had grown full. So, everyone rushed to the two fluffy little lives like a swarm of bees, surrounding them, vying to stroke them with their rough, dark palms, and blessing them, making a commotion for most of the day, like a group of big children. Later, we caught the mother rabbit every day to feed them milk. Now, these two little cubs can also jump and hop inside and outside the wooden fence.

These small creatures are a revelation to me.

Life is mysterious and incredible. In some respects, it is very fragile, and can be lost at any time. But at the same time, it is unusually strong. No matter what the environment, it will survive. Even in this death-filled prison, relying only on the leftovers of the prisoners, the sparrows and rabbits still live on, and even continue their offspring, so that this small life does not come to an end.

This is just as Jesus Christ said: "... Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes? Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?"

Therefore, one should understand why, in prison, those prisoners who have been sentenced to life imprisonment, whose families have stopped providing assistance and whose relatives and friends do not visit, are able to live stubbornly, relying only on a portion of prison rations that is not enough to fill them but is enough to keep them from starving.

Life is fragile, but it is even more tenacious. I will live on more persistently.

In this prison, I accidentally came across an old newspaper that had been used to wrap something. On the back of the newspaper, there was an unremarkable article that quoted a few words from the Swedish philosopher Doe. Xun Smith's "Theory of Crime": "... Legislators are guilty, and their judges are prisoners... A prisoner is successful because he does not have the talent for fraud..."

These words gave me a deep feeling. If I had read these words outside before, I might have thought that this was a literary flourish, or at least a bit of an exaggeration. But now, because of the various facts that I have seen with my own eyes and heard with my own ears, I know that there is truth in his words. (To be continued)

### Rainy Night

— Zhongyuan

Another desolate rainy night.

Lately, I have really been afraid of rainy nights. I fear the murmuring sound that seems to complain and lament. I fear the thunder and lightning in the dark and chaotic world. I fear the relentless cold wind hitting my windows. I fear the gray walls, the black shadows, the terrifying sky, the chaotic earth.

I put on a thin coat and sit by the window. I silently stare at a dim lamp. I have no tears to shed, no sighs to utter, yet I am still in pain, still have to recall.

I recall that once, on a similarly desolate rainy night, I sat under this dim lamp writing a letter to her. I told her that I was grateful for her remembrance and thanked her for her comfort. But most importantly, I wanted to tell her:

"Now is a chaotic dark night. I know you are awake. Go!"

I spread a clean white piece of paper on the table. My pen tip moved on it incessantly, but when I wrote this sentence, my fingers trembled. A question welled up in my heart: I am so insignificant, can I write this to her?

I considered myself prudent, considered myself clever. So, in the end, I did not write that sentence.

Unexpectedly, that bit of prudence caused eternal regret. That bit of cleverness left behind bottomless heartache!

The chaotic dark night has passed, but she can no longer see the bright daylight, and I can no longer see her gentle face.

Tonight, it is another desolate rainy night. I have no tears to shed, no sighs to utter, yet I am still in pain, still unable to forget that unfortunate friend!

### Long Serial Novel: Shuang Su Shuang Fei (Paired Flight) (52)

— Zhao Qingge

Despite Mr. Liao's propaganda, the miraculous effects of the foreign doctor attracted people irresistibly. No one believed that the foreign doctor was cheating, and no one believed that Mr. Liao's words were true! It was a small matter that the business of Huichuntang became deserted. Mr. Liao's good intentions to save the public were wasted, which made him sad! Mr. Liao's psychology of hoping for human health was not at all hypocritical. It was just that he stubbornly believed that the treatment of the foreign doctor and the effectiveness of those foreign medicines were not due to the foreign doctor's high medical skills or the goodness of the foreign medicine; but first, it was the luck of the patients, and second, the foreign doctor and the foreign medicine were lucky! In any case, using scissors and knives to treat diseases was something that Mr. Liao dared not and could not flatter!

However, in fact, since the foreign doctor and the foreign medicines became popular, most of the patients recovered, and none died. As time went on, Mr. Liao's anger subsided slightly, because he had calmly thought that as long as everyone was healthy, it would be good! Although seeing a blank page when the bell rang at night to settle accounts was an embarrassing pain for him! Especially when the proprietress nagged incessantly, it made him even more annoyed, but he was able to restrain the development of his selfish instincts with a compassionate heart.

Mr. Liao was still a kind and honest man after all!

The proprietress was a woman, a woman who had not received a good education; and a woman who was born narrow-minded; a woman from a butcher's family; therefore, she could not be as open-minded and benevolent as Mr. Liao! She had endured for a long time, and finally one day she could not bear it anymore. She found an excuse to "launch a punitive expedition" against Mr. Liao!

"Life is getting tighter and tighter, and I can't stand it! The end of the year is approaching, and we have to slaughter a pig at home to make some preserved meat," the proprietress said angrily. Three sentences are inseparable from her profession. She always forgets "pig" when she opens her mouth, and she always likes to "slaughter" and "kill" when she opens her mouth.

"Business is not good. This year, we have to compromise a bit for the New Year! It would be a blessing to be able to avoid debt, let alone slaughtering any pigs," Mr. Liao said with a full heart of depression, speaking in a Sichuan accent.

This time, the proprietress seized the handle. She immediately went straight to the point and said with a sneer:

"Hehe! What does it matter if business is not good? As long as people are not sick, I am willing to lose money!"

"Stop being sarcastic with me! It's not that no one is sick now, it's that when other people get sick, they don't come to buy our medicine. Because they are superstitious about foreign doctors and only buy foreign medicine."

"Ah, so that's how it is! Then it doesn't matter even more! As long as foreign medicine can cure people's diseases, it's okay if they don't buy our medicine. Anyway, you, Mr. Liao, have always been compassionate." The proprietress said more and more sarcastically.

"That's the reason, so business is not good!"

When Mr. Liao said this, he thought that the proprietress would understand him and no longer mention the matter of slaughtering pigs for the New Year. Who knew that the proprietress would not only not understand him, but this time her face sank and she simply lost her temper.

"It doesn't matter if business is bad, that's a matter for your shop; slaughtering pigs for the New Year, that's a matter for my family; you can compromise, but I can't compromise! You are compassionate to others, you should also be compassionate to my daughter and me! I married you, not to suffer with you!"

"What are you thinking? Don't push me!" Mr. Liao also lost his temper. When Mr. Liao lost his temper, he would scold people in his authentic Sichuan dialect.

Commercial News

### Amidst Eager Buying from All Quarters, the US Dollar Continues to Rise; Gold Prices Also Boosted to 60,000

Yesterday, the Shanghai market continued to advance. The main driver was still the US dollar. It opened directly above the 1.9 million mark in the morning. After opening, it hovered and rose in a stable state, rising to above 1.93 million after 10 o'clock. The Bank of China allocated 330 items to the industry at a price of 1.93 million. After entering, it slightly declined, but due to the rapid advance of the US dollar, there were many arbitrageurs. At noon, it rose to 1.96 million. In the early afternoon, it was still stable. Spot transactions started, and it once rose to 1.97 million, but then it turned flat due to pressure. As a result, it closed 60,000 higher than the previous close. Gold jewelry rose to 100,080, silver taels remained flat, silver dollars rose slightly again, and the unofficial discount remained between 1.2 and 1.5 jiao.

The foreign exchange market continues to feel the scarcity of US dollars. Various floating funds are returning, and importers are struggling endlessly. Speculators and retail investors are rushing to buy. From the initial 2,600 yuan in the early morning, it gradually rose, reaching 2,750 yuan before noon before there was a source of supply, and it briefly fell. However, at noon, it still settled at around 2,740 yuan. In the afternoon, it once rose to over 1.760 yuan, and then leveled off slightly. As a result, it continued to rise by 130. Hong Kong tickets were also boosted by 15 yuan. Indian remittances rose to 550 yuan, Hong Kong remittances to 455 yuan. There are many cotton settlements, and the US exchange rate is still nominally flat but unofficially tight.

### Foreign Exchange Applications Must Be Pre-Audited

In order to avoid wasting foreign exchange, the Central Bank, in addition to notifying designated banks to handle matters in accordance with regulations, requires all applications from merchants to be pre-audited by the Central Bank. If the application is not made in accordance with regulations, the sale of foreign exchange will be suspended. Regarding materials approved for import, if there is competition among merchants, the bank may reduce the amount accordingly. If purchasing materials lacking domestically, special approval may also be granted. The established measures are flexible.

According to a person in charge of the bank, in order to manage foreign exchange prudently, the Central Bank has issued a notice to the domestic and foreign banks in this city that handle foreign exchange, requiring them to carefully consider the qualifications and uses of the foreign exchange applicant when selling foreign exchange, such as: (1) Whether the importer is a direct user, (2) If operating as a general importer, whether a contract has been concluded with the manufacturer or distributor for the import, or (3) If a distributor of imported goods, whether they have been operating for three years before the Pacific War, otherwise, a special permit from the Central Bank is required. Attention must also be paid to whether the foreign exporter accepting the ordered goods is reliable in terms of credit, and the import credit letter must include various insurance and inspection documents related to the transaction. In addition, the Central Bank requests all designated banks handling foreign exchange to pay attention to the current provisions in the import application form (Format 6A), "Guarantee that all imported goods supplied with foreign exchange or their equivalent inventory are immediately sold and used."

### After the Lottery, Government Bonds Decline

After yesterday's lottery, the person in charge of the public debt department said that the actual situation of the bond market's rise was not to be followed, which was slightly hit. At the opening of the market yesterday, the C unified bonds fell to below 5,550 yuan. After the opening, some of the northern gang on the fifth floor closed out, and the 5,000 yuan mark was broken. The short sellers took advantage of the low price to buy in, and two major households on the seventh floor bought short positions, rising from 4,950 yuan to around 5,200 yuan. As a result, it closed 650 yuan lower than the previous close. A and B bonds fell by 300 yuan, and D and E bonds also fell by 400 yuan.

### The Decline in the Yarn Market Has Stopped; Trading of Raw Cotton Is Quite Smooth

Yesterday, the yarn market stabilized, because the price of gold rose. Cantonese merchants bought double horse spot goods, so the prices of various large yarns rose by 20,000 to 30,000. The sales of small and medium-sized goods were stagnant, and the prices were flat. The decline in fine yarns and double yarns has stopped, but there is still no sign of a turnaround. The price of fine yarns opened by the Textile Construction Institute in recent periods has been reduced by tens of thousands each period, so the industry is cautious and temporarily does not dare to take on more.

Yesterday, the New York American cotton telegraph showed that 27-39 pounds were counted. The recent price was US$29.09, the forward price was 29.52, and the Mitterling spot price was 29.80. The transaction of raw cotton in this port continued to improve, because foreign cotton was strong, and factories such as Suzhou Su, Changzhou Dacheng, and Wuxi Qingfeng successively purchased.

### Stable Cloth Market in Shanghai

Due to the good market conditions in Tianjin, orders for grey cloth have been placed. Therefore, 12-pound "Color Ball V Dragon Head" fine cloth is firm. There is still demand from Sichuan, Shanxi, Guangdong, and Fujian provinces for serge. Available bleached cloth is in short supply, and prices are also rising. Although cloth merchants from the Scholars' Forest area are not making large purchases, their momentum is gradually developing. The opening prices for the China Textile Company in the afternoon were average. "V Dragon" fine cloth was not available, but five other types of fine cloth were. Twenty-four types of American and Mexican cloth were added. Due to enthusiastic purchasing, allocation lists will be issued tomorrow morning.

### U.S. Price Control Bureau Abolishes Price Controls on Pig Bristles

[Reuters, Washington, 11th] The Price Control Bureau has abolished price controls on animal hair and pig bristles (except for those used for brooms). These raw materials are used domestically to manufacture brushes and brooms.

### Diamond Demand Increasing Worldwide, Including Shanghai

[Reuters, London, 11th] The demand for diamonds is currently quite strong in Shanghai, the Soviet Union, and Singapore, as well as in Latin America and India. Demand is more moderate in Middle Eastern countries. The United States still has a very high demand, as Americans seem quite worried about inflation. Demand is particularly strong in California due to wealthy people moving there and lower state taxes. In short, the world needs more diamonds (just like it needs more gold, silver, platinum, etc.) than can currently be supplied. As a result, prices are bound to be much higher than controlled prices.

### Look at the United States Today: More Money Than Goods, Nowhere to Buy

Government Price Limits Force Manufacturers to Stop Production

[Report from this newspaper] According to Mr. Reed, a prominent American businessman who arrived in Shanghai yesterday from the United States, there is currently more money than goods in the United States, and the phenomenon of having money but nowhere to buy goods has occurred. Due to continuous labor strikes, production has been greatly affected. At the same time, because the government's price limits are too strict, merchants are voluntarily stopping production. For example, for shoes, the government's price limit is six dollars, but manufacturers are demanding an increase to ten dollars. The government has refused, and manufacturers, seeing no profit, have voluntarily stopped production. Currently, items such as shoes and shirts are extremely difficult to buy in the United States. Mr. Reed also said that although China has placed large orders with the United States, it is unlikely that they will be delivered within this year.

### Overseas Sales of Chinese Tea Remain Stagnant

Recently, local industry peers have repeatedly sent tea samples abroad to actively promote the export of Chinese tea. It is now known that news from South America indicates that various black and green tea samples have been received and the quality of the goods is satisfactory. However, they ultimately find the price too high. According to their intentions, only if the price is between US$0.35 and $0.40 per pound would large quantities be purchased. However, local tea merchants find it difficult to part with their goods due to cost considerations. Based on the current situation, overseas sales of Chinese tea are feared to remain stagnant for the time being. As for domestic sales of floral teas, local shops are still eagerly adding stock. However, nearby areas have been affected by intermittent rains, and finished goods have not been shipped out, so demand is not as active as the previous day. However, those holding goods are still reluctant to sell, and the market remains stable and attractive.

### Medium Sugar Rises by 4,000 Yuan

Yesterday, the sugar market was tight due to a lack of enemy-produced goods and supplies from the Taiwan Company, causing prices to rise again. In the morning, the association quoted medium-grade white sugar at 75,000 yuan for the initial spot price, then 76,000 yuan for double-packed sugar, and 6,500 yuan for single-bag sugar. In the afternoon, double-packed sugar rose to 77,000-77,500 yuan, an increase of 4,000 yuan. Warehouse receipts rose from 73,500 yuan to 77,500 yuan, an increase of over 4,000 yuan. No. 22 medium-grade white sugar was quoted at 81,000 yuan. A few dozen bags of cotton lake red sugar opened at 78,000 yuan, while dark blue sugar opened at 62,000 yuan, followed by 60,000 yuan, an increase of 4,000-5,000 yuan. The price of extracted blue sugar was 64,000-65,000 yuan.

### Bituminous Coal Price Drops; Coal Arrivals Have Been Very Strong Recently

Sales of bituminous coal from coal factories have slowed down as most factories have reduced production after the holiday, and some factories have even stopped production. Given that the recent market price of bituminous coal has greatly exceeded the allocated price, many have entrusted coal merchants to resell it on the market, increasing supply. Furthermore, the Fuel Management Committee has approved the allocation of 5,000 metric tons of bituminous coal to coal merchants in May (including 2,500 metric tons of No. 2 Kai Ping coal dust and 2,500 metric tons of Guan Ping train coal at the same allocation price as before). Most merchants agreed to accept the above-mentioned allocation of coal, as rumors of factories receiving allocated coal through the association were rife. As a result, those holding inventory became wary of being locked in again and began to cut prices, causing the market to decline rapidly.

According to the Fuel Management Committee, yesterday's announcement stated that the "Henry" ship transported 9,650 tons of coal from Qinhuangdao, and the British ship "Hotama Maru" transported over 10,000 tons of coal yesterday. This coal was produced by the Kai coal mine. It is expected that a large amount of coal will arrive tomorrow, which will be allocated to various state-owned and private factories in the city.

### Confidence Rising, Credit Easing: The Shanghai Stock Market is Extremely Smooth; Foreign Stocks Were Boosted Immediately Upon Opening

Chinese stocks were initially flat but then became firm. Short covering was slightly active. Major stocks were exceptionally strong, while minor stocks rose only limitedly. The trend has become promising. In the early morning, prices were low, with Wing On Cotton Mill at 5,600 yuan, American-Asia at 4,100 yuan, King Fook at 295 yuan, New Kwong at 285 yuan, and Keen Hing at 218 yuan. These low prices were quickly raised, fluctuating upwards. The market was average mid-day. Later, Cantonese investors entered the Wing On Cotton Mill market. Influenced by gold and currency, confidence rose and credit eased. As a result, Wing On Cotton Mill rose by 5%, American-Asia rose by 10%, and King Fook rose less, while New Kwong and Keen Hing rose by slightly more than 5%. Due to time constraints, cold stocks rose only slightly. Foreign stocks were boosted immediately upon opening, coinciding with the firmness of gold, currency, and Chinese stocks. As a result, the market was immediately boosted. Jardine Matheson stood firm at 12,000 yuan, and continued to rise after opening. Consequently, Jardine Matheson, British-American Tobacco, and Wheelock Marden each rose by about 10% compared to the previous closing. Minor stocks were less impressive, rising only slightly. Asia, with the lowest market price, was sought after by retail investors and rose by a remarkable 10%.

### Chinese Silk Stockings Shipped to the United States

[Reuters, Philadelphia, 11th] According to "Women's Wear Daily," silk stockings shipped from China and Japan, priced between US$3.94 and $9.95 per pair, have already been sold here in small quantities. These stockings have not been advertised. Customers can purchase them upon inquiry.

### Most Cocoon Exchanges Suspend Weighing; Cocoon Prices Reach Nearly 200,000 Yuan

According to a prominent figure in the cocoon industry: The Wuxi spring cocoon market has been open for a week since June 3rd. Cocoon collection has been satisfactory, but cocoon prices vary depending on the quality of the cocoons. The central silk farm believed that the cocoon prices were too low, and silkworm farmers were unwilling to sell. The silk farm increased cocoon prices to maintain the cost for silkworm farmers. Cocoon exchanges also increased prices to compete for purchases, which pushed up cocoon prices. By the 8th of this month, the highest price had reached 195,000 yuan, making it impossible for cocoon exchanges to purchase, so they suspended operations. As of yesterday, two-thirds of the cocoon exchanges had suspended operations, while silkworm farmers still hoped that cocoon prices would rise further and were waiting to see what would happen. Therefore, transactions have been very rare recently. The spring cocoon market is nearing its end. It is reported that cocoon exchanges in Jiangyin and Changshu have already suspended operations.

### The Rice Market is Quiet in Terms of Both Arrivals and Sales; Mixed Grains and Oil Cakes Show Mixed Trends

Yesterday, the rice market saw sales keeping pace with arrivals. Supply and demand were neither strong nor weak, and the situation was stable. Flour sales were stagnant, and prices were weak, down 300-400 yuan. Soybean prices were tight in the morning but eased in the afternoon. Shelled peanuts rebounded by over 1,000 yuan. Broad bean sales were sluggish, down another 1,000 yuan. Corn prices fell by 1,000 yuan. Wheat sales were still acceptable, rising another 1,000 yuan. Bran sales in rural areas were active, rebounding by 100-200 yuan. Soybean cake rose by 300-400 yuan, and oil prices also rose by over 2,000 yuan. According to rice market news, a total of over 4,000 piculs of rice, including seven types of white glutinous rice, arrived in the city. The types and quantities are as follows: White glutinous rice: 1,763 piculs; Thin rice: 929 piculs; Early rice: 65 piculs; Yang glutinous rice: 468 piculs; Du glutinous rice: 10 piculs; Wu glutinous rice: 615 piculs; White yuan: 158 piculs.

### Pu River Unloading Fees Are Too High; Up to 14,000 Yuan Per Ton; Barge and Truck Fees Are Not Included

After foreign and seagoing vessels arrive at the Pu River, the unloading fees are often arbitrarily charged, not following regulations. Shipping companies and import and export merchants are feeling a headache over this issue. It is said that various shipping companies will petition the government to strictly regulate the fees to facilitate transportation. Regarding current unloading fees, apart from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, which is relatively low, the others are high. Ordinary goods are charged up to 14,000 yuan per ton. The unloading fees of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and other shipping companies are listed as follows:

(1) China Merchants Steam Navigation Company: The unloading labor cost is 5,000 yuan per ton, calculated at 250 yuan per piece for every 100 catties. This labor cost includes the cost of opening the warehouse, moving the goods, and the upper and lower labor costs for direct entry into the warehouse. If there is no wharf to dock at, barges must be hired at 2,000 yuan per ton, calculated at a minimum of 30 tons.

(2) Other shipping companies: The unloading labor cost is 14,000 yuan per ton, or 700 yuan per piece, which also includes the cost of opening the warehouse, moving the goods, and the upper and lower labor costs for direct entry into the warehouse. If trucks are hired, the transportation fee is 1,500 yuan per piece, totaling 30,000 yuan per ton. If there is no wharf to dock at and barges must be hired, the cost ranges from 16,000 yuan to 20,000 yuan per ton. These labor costs apply to imported materials such as cotton and pig bristles. For mountain products and medicinal materials, an additional 50% is added to each piece, and the labor cost is 21,000 yuan per ton. The additional cost does not apply when hiring trucks or barges.

### Yangtzekiang Finance Corporation Shares

London Market Price Gradually Improves

[Reuters, London, 11th] The "Evening Standard" reports that the price of Yangtzekiang Finance Corporation's ordinary preferred shares has recently reached one shilling and nine pence, seemingly because the company's mining rights and other rights in China have gained value after the end of the war against Japan.

Before the outbreak of the war, the British side had an agreement with the Chinese government to establish a Sino-British joint venture to engage in mining, industry, and other businesses in Sichuan Province. However, negotiations were suspended for a long time due to the war. The company's capital is 300,140 pounds, of which 168,013 pounds has been paid up.

### Central Bank Official Discusses: The Rise of the U.S. Dollar is Purely Speculative

Sufficient Foreign Exchange Reserves; Changing the Exchange Rate Would Only Stimulate Prices

[Report from this newspaper] Recently, the exchange rate has been rising, and discussions about currency reform have been rampant. The market for U.S. dollars and gold has been rising steadily. A reporter asked a responsible official at the Central Bank about relevant issues. The official said that the bank's priority has always been to be pragmatic and focused on work, so it has consistently ignored all outside speculation and conjecture, relying only on the facts to refute all rumors. The handling of foreign exchange and gold since March is generally visible. Regarding a recent Reuters report from New York about China's currency reform, the official said it was pure nonsense, but speculators have taken it as a prelude to new foreign exchange measures and promoted it vigorously. They are unaware that the authorities have already made up their minds and that all measures will be taken to safeguard the welfare of the 450 million compatriots. Now that the soaring rice prices have just subsided, suddenly changing the exchange rate would not necessarily help export businesses, but prices would rise in response. This would be like aiding evildoers, which is unwise. As for the future of the foreign exchange market, the official, due to his position, was unwilling to express his opinion. Regarding rumors that a certain company has monopolized import trade and manipulated foreign exchange, the official said he had not heard of it and believed that no one would dare to monopolize it. He said that any accusations should be based on solid evidence, otherwise, baseless rumors would not help in any way. He believes that the recent rise in the U.S. dollar is purely speculative and unreasonable. At the beginning of the opening of the foreign exchange and gold markets, prices fluctuated according to the market, as originally stipulated. Now, the foreign exchange market has remained stable, while the gold market has changed daily. The reason for this is that the foreign exchange market implicitly reflects the external value of the legal currency. The stability of the foreign exchange market is enough to show that the value of the legal currency has remained stable externally. Gold, on the other hand, is a commodity and cannot be compared to currency. The price of goods naturally fluctuates slightly due to supply and demand. Furthermore, the world gold price has also increased slightly recently, so the local gold price has also increased slightly. As for the Central Bank's foreign exchange reserves, they are very sufficient. Since the opening of the foreign exchange market, although there have been many foreign exchange settlements from importers, remittances from overseas Chinese, frozen funds of our country abroad, and the recently successful U.S. cotton loan of over 30 million, are all sufficient to offset and exceed the settlements. Therefore, there is no fear of a shortage of foreign exchange. Finally, the official reiterated that if the authorities are going to change any major measures related to the national economy, they must carefully consider and plan thoroughly beforehand to ensure that the changes are beneficial to the public before they are implemented. Therefore, the public should not easily believe any rumors in the market and be taken advantage of by speculators.

### The World's Attention on the Soviet Union: Acknowledging the Existence of a Major War Crisis

Special Compilation by This Newspaper's Editorial Department

The Soviet Union is currently the most watched country, because in the event of a Third World War (if it were to break out), it would occupy a major position.

We must first understand the Soviet Union's perspective. The Soviet Communist Party's official newspaper, "Pravda," recently published an article by Professor Moderev of Moscow University, stating, "There are many contradictory issues in the world today that are sufficient to cause war." This statement already indicates that the Soviet Union recognizes that the possibility of war is certain.

The most important section of the article states: "Now, the fact that colonies exploit yellow and black races and the attempt to force all mankind to accept the rule of Anglo-Saxon countries expose racial prejudice and clearly contain the seeds of war. There are many contradictory issues in the world today that are sufficient to cause war. Only by adopting a policy based on treaties and mutual respect for the will of the people of other countries as soon as possible can the powers avert the crisis."

The author's conclusion further expresses the current purpose of the Soviet Union. He warns all countries, believing that "the powers have no other way but to cooperate with the Soviet Union."

Stalin Will Not Step Down; The Red Army Will Not Mutiny

On the other hand, the May issue of the "Reader's Digest" published an article explaining the inside story of the Soviet Union. Now, the important parts of that article are extracted as follows:

Many foreign observers believe that there is potential rebellion among the Red Army commanders, which is wishful thinking. The Red Army marshals have received training suitable for military institutions and are well-treated, but are not allowed to have political speaking rights. Marshal Zhukov is a most appropriate example. Even on minor political matters, he is not allowed to decide without instructions from Moscow. Some foreign reporters completely misunderstand the relationship between the Soviet Union and Stalin. They believe that Stalin will gradually reduce his power, but Stalin will only hand over power after his death. He is respected by the Soviet people, and if errors occur, the blame should be borne by his subordinates. Stalin's power is still supreme and unlimited, and only the thirteen members of the Political Committee can freely express their opinions to him. The Political Committee may be the only democratic institution in the Soviet Union. The most powerful person in the Political Committee is Malenkov, who has full power to handle the promotion and transfer of senior officials. Molotov does not directly participate in domestic affairs, but his international political reports are enough to influence domestic affairs.

Recently, many foreign observers believe that the Soviet leaders are not communists and have become nationalists. In fact, they are still full Marxists. They use nationalism as they use religion.

Are we about to go to war with the Soviet Union? The possibility of this war cannot be avoided. Can we cooperate with the Soviet Union? If what we call cooperation is as close as the cooperation between Britain and the United States, Britain and France, or France and Belgium, then the answer is "no." But we can have commercial relations with the Soviet Union.

If Soviet policy remains unchanged, we cannot hope to have cultural and intellectual relations with them. In fact, there has never been an exchange of students between the United States and the Soviet Union.

Many military observers predict that infighting will occur in the Soviet Union after Stalin's death. Stalin and the Politburo have paid close attention to this. After Stalin's death, power will remain in the Politburo.

The burdens that the current Soviet leaders place on the people are heavier than those of other people, but these leaders have led the Soviet Union to victory. Now, what they hope for is security and a better life.

Military Officer Sent to the Soviet Union; The Subtle Relationship Between the United States and the Soviet Union

Amidst the tensions in U.S.-Soviet relations, Smith has succeeded Harriman as the envoy to the Soviet Union. Can he improve relations between the two countries? The views of "International Digest" on this issue are worth our attention. "International Digest" writes:

The key figures in the U.S. State Department unanimously believe that the U.S. Embassy in the Soviet Union is the most important diplomatic outpost for the United States. What happens in the U.S. Embassy in Moscow over the next two years is enough to influence world trends over the next twenty years. Whether the friendly relations between the United States and the Soviet Union are strengthened or weakened largely depends on the development trends of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. The mission of ambassadors in history is probably not greater than what Smith shoulders today.

Diplomatic circles are certainly very clear that Smith's mission is to promote understanding and friendship between the United States and the Soviet Union, but some people are skeptical, wondering how the Soviet Union can be understood when the United States places Eisenhower's most promising successor at the doorstep of the Kremlin? If one wants to promote world peace, one must first eliminate all military measures that may cause suspicion. What is the purpose of the United States sending a military officer to head the U.S. Embassy in the Soviet Union? Why not replace Smith immediately with an experienced civilian official like Wallace?

These questions can be answered immediately from the U.S. Army and Navy Country Club in Washington. Military figures who are familiar with Smith say that he is best suited for this position because speaking to the Soviets requires a frank and resolute attitude, which is unique to Smith. In fact, Smith has a very harmonious relationship with the top Soviet military officers.

But there will always be a subtle relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union. Smith's predecessor, Harriman, was unable to resolve various disputes during his tenure in the Soviet Union. Therefore, Washington's diplomatic circles are watching Harriman's successor with skeptical eyes. Their concern has not diminished since Smith began his mission.

President Truman believes that Smith is best suited to perform this task of promoting friendly relations because Smith is familiar with the style of military diplomats during World War II. Someone once suggested to Smith that the United States should announce the State Department's criticism of the Soviet Union to the world. Smith solemnly replied, "We want to negotiate with the Soviet Union, not criticize the Soviet Union."

Since Smith took office as the U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, "Helmet Diplomacy" has become a topic of attention in Washington. It is not that Washington officials doubt Smith's determination to carry out a peaceful mission, but what some sensitive observers are concerned about is this: the whole world is painstakingly trying to jump out of the waters of war. Would it not be better if the United States could send a non-military envoy to the Soviet Union?

### Stalin, Do It to the End

——Saving Human Lives—— Destroying the Nazi Atomic Nest

If Germany had invented the atomic bomb before the Allied forces in World War II, what impact would it have had on the outcome of the war? What would the world look like today? To say that Germany could have turned defeat into victory might be sensational and exaggerated. However, London and Moscow, the two crucial fortresses of resistance in Europe, would have undoubtedly been the first to be turned to ashes like Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Even Washington across the Atlantic and China's wartime capital, Chongqing, would likely have been spared. However, why didn't Germany invent the atomic bomb? Was their scientific and technological level insufficient? Did German scientists not think of this possibility? Neither of these were the reason. I believe there are two primary reasons for Germany's failure in this area. First, many German scientists, especially many talented German-Jewish scientists, were unwilling to serve the Nazis, who killed without batting an eye. The direction of people's hearts has its own divine justice! Second, the necessary raw materials for manufacturing the atomic bomb were destroyed by Allied special forces. The following is a thrilling story about this significant event, called the "Heavy Water" Raid.

What is "heavy water"? "Heavy water" is a necessary raw material for manufacturing the atomic bomb; its scientific name is Deuterium Oxide. What is the "Heavy Water" Raid? From the words themselves, it can be seen that it is an attack on the place where "heavy water" is manufactured. Originally, within Germany proper and throughout the German-occupied territories, only the Norsk Hydro plant in Vemork, Norway, produced this extremely precious chemical substance during the war. In May 1940, the British received disturbing intelligence that Germany had ordered the plant to increase "heavy water" production to 3,000 pounds per year; by mid-1942, they demanded an increase to 10,000 pounds.

In July 1942, the British Cabinet advocated attacking Vemork and doing so quickly. In wartime, time is of the essence. Two officers and two corporals were immediately selected from the Norwegian Army, and the team was codenamed "Swallow." At 11:30 PM on October 15, 1942, they parachuted into the mountainous area east of Fjellereppe. Once the initial work was successful, the British would send a glider team to retrieve them.

The difficult terrain of Norway is world-renowned, with mountains and valleys everywhere, and in winter, the whole country turns into a silvery world of white snow. These four Norwegian soldiers fought hard against the various difficulties of nature. Their loyal and patriotic hearts for the survival of their motherland and the victory of the United Nations finally overcame countless hardships and obtained invaluable intelligence.

On November 19, two aircraft towing two gliders took off from a base in Scotland. Unfortunately, one aircraft and two gliders crashed near the Norwegian coast. As a result, they had to start from scratch and train another special attack team of six men. The development of events is often not linear but curved.

The "Swallow" team waited patiently. At midnight on February 16, 1943, six Norwegian soldiers landed on the frozen Lake Skriken, 30 miles northwest of the "Swallow" team's location. In Norway, walking 30 miles in winter is more difficult than walking 300 miles in a temperate zone. However, with iron will, the two sides finally made contact.

Speed is essential in war. The date when the two teams joined up was February 21, and the date of the attack was also February 21. Here, two points should be particularly emphasized: (1) Although the total number of men in the two teams was only ten, the decisive nature of their mission was no less than that of a battleground with thousands of troops; (2) Fighting on a formal battlefield can embolden even the timid, but operating in enemy-occupied territory with a small number of personnel, traversing desolate mountains and snow-covered lands, to carry out a mission with no certainty of success, requires even greater alertness and courage.

The two teams departed from their base at 8:00 PM. They stopped 500 meters from the factory gate and waited until 12:30 AM before cautiously crawling forward. Based on prior intelligence, the team leader sent one person to open two unguarded iron gates. Although the gates were locked, they were easily pushed open after being cut with military-grade wire cutters. Upon command, the cover team and demolition team followed. The second task was to destroy the electrolytic plant. However, the outer doors of the factory building were closed even more tightly, and they could not force their way in. The only way in was through the underground tunnel. Time was of the essence, so they filed in one by one. Inside the tunnel, lead pipes crisscrossed, making movement very difficult. Suddenly, looking towards the opposite window, they saw a dark shadow flash by; this was the guard, their immediate enemy! With a "crash," the window was smashed, and the guard, caught off guard, was captured on the spot. Once this obstacle was overcome, the team leader immediately began to lay explosives, set the fuse, and the entire team retreated at once, hiding 20 yards away, listening for good news. As expected, there was a deafening explosion that shook the earth. This explosion destroyed about 3,000 pounds of "heavy water"!

Order inside the factory was momentarily disrupted. The guards who had been guarding the front gate also rushed in, but the attackers took this opportunity to slip out through the front gate!

Good heavens! Even the German commander-in-chief in Norway said: "This attack is the only one of its kind I have ever seen in my life."

From then on, the Germans became uneasy. The factory负责人repeatedly requested the German side to transport the machinery and remaining "heavy water" to Germany. However, this was a significant matter, and the German side could not immediately make a decision. However, the increasingly tense situation forced the German side to finally decide to relocate.

This news was obtained again by the Allied special forces, who immediately reported it to their superiors in England. The order retrieved by the wartime cabinet was: "Regardless of anything, the equipment for manufacturing 'heavy water' and the already manufactured 'heavy water' must be destroyed; they must not be allowed to leave the country."

At that time, only five members of the special forces remained in Norway, but the work still had to be done. At the same time, the German defenses became increasingly tight, with guards stationed almost every five steps along the railway line. However, for some unknown reason, no guards were stationed on the transport ship carrying this important cargo. It was truly a case of "destiny is difficult to defy," leaving people speechless! The Allied special forces found this weakness and, while the sailors were playing poker in the ship's hold, planted a time bomb. After the ship had sailed about a thousand miles from port, it exploded with a roar, and as a result, 3,600 gallons of "heavy water" and all the machinery were buried at the bottom of the sea.

"Why didn't Germany have an atomic bomb?" The story above explains one of the many reasons.

### Rare News: The Trade in Human Heads

When the writer was residing in Quito, Ecuador, South America, one night I woke up in a hotel room and suddenly caught sight of a person holding a woman's head, placing it in front of me, while whispering in a rough voice: "Sir! Sir! Only fifty dollars, very cheap!" You can imagine that my shock at that time was extraordinary.

The head was indeed that of a young woman, as could be determined by her long, black, beautiful hair. The local Indians there are accustomed to removing the bones from human heads, shrinking them to a quarter of their original size, and selling them to white people as a commodity. South America has many mysterious things, and this "shrunken head" is the most mysterious of all!

### Replacing an Old Heart with a New Heart

Recently, a Soviet scientist has successfully experimented with "heart transplantation." This news has shocked the world's medical community. Recently, Dr. Sinitsyn, a scientist at the Gorky Institute of Experimental Medicine in Moscow, succeeded in experimenting with "heart transplantation," further attracting the attention of the medical community. Sinitsyn used frogs for the experiment because frogs have the simplest hearts.

After Sinitsyn's successful experiment with frogs, he further experimented with warm-blooded animals such as cats, dogs, and rabbits, whose hearts are quite similar to human hearts. Sinitsyn's plan is to create replacement hearts for human use, preparing to attach a second, stronger heart when the original heart weakens. The ultimate goal is to achieve heart transplantation, attaching the heart externally and removing the original heart after it functions well. The success of this matter still depends on the future, but the hope of success is great. If so, human lifespan can be extended considerably.

### The Vatican and the Kremlin Have Reached the Point of Close Combat

— Translated by Xi Jie from Newsweek

Europe was once the world of Catholicism, but nowadays Europeans are pursuing not ideals but reality. With the end of the war, the Vatican is facing one of the most serious problems in history. Pope Pius XII watched millions of starving people being swallowed up by the Soviet invasion forces, becoming increasingly worried. Now it has reached the period of close combat between religion and politics. The power of the Roman Catholic Church has begun to extend into the vortex of politics.

In the past year, Pope Pius XII has delivered more than 25 speeches, urging the world's 33.8 million Catholics to stand firm in their faith, unite, and fight to the death against the materialism and secularism of communist countries. On May 12, the Pope delivered a speech to more than 40,000 Italian women, addressing the Italian elections on June 2, urging them to elect candidates who can respect God and religion, and not to elect leftist figures. Two days later, the New York Communist Party newspaper "Daily Worker" published an article accusing the Pope of participating in the Italian election movement.

The conflict between Catholicism and communism has a long history, but it has become more acute today. In the past year, the Vatican and the Kremlin have repeatedly retorted each other with sharp words in each new strategy they launched, revealing their sharp edges. Last December, the Pope announced the election of 32 cardinals from countries around the world, stating that the Church should be transnational and should no longer be solely presided over by the Italian people. The Soviet "Izvestia" immediately published an article attacking this move, pointing out that the election of cardinals was an action by the Vatican to spread "reactionary" forces to countries around the world, attempting to enhance the prestige of the Roman Catholic Church in democratic countries.

Pope Pius XII of Rome is approaching the age of seventy and has always hated communism throughout his life. During his twelve years of residence in Germany, he strongly opposed communism and was once targeted for assassination by the Red Army without success. Recently, the Pope has shown tolerance towards the Franco government because the Spanish government allows people religious freedom. Church members deeply believe that if Franco steps down at this time, it will cause civil unrest in Spain, and civil unrest would create an opportunity for the Communist Party.

### An Adventure in Lincheng

— Qiao Zi

Lincheng was besieged by the Chinese Communists (New Fourth Army) for eight months. This fierce attack by 120,000 Communist troops not only failed to gain an advantage, but also resulted in the sacrifice of more than 20,000 men. Following Lincheng, they suddenly attacked Zaozhuang, with the aim of eliminating the vulnerable corner of Lincheng. After trapping the city in isolation, they planned to use their usual tactic of destroying it piece by piece. Little did they know that they would run into another brick wall. They could only gather their defeated troops and besiege Lincheng and Zaozhuang. During this time, I traveled between Lincheng and Xuzhou three times, each time being subjected to repeated inspections and suffering many unpleasant words and mental insults! In their "peace zone," one could only swallow their anger and try to smile more, otherwise, you couldn't expect to pass through.

This time, we were demobilized. Due to the more tense situation than before, grain transport was denied two or three times, so many of our comrades dared not leave and waited for a chance to speak again. I, regardless, set off with two comrades on a risky journey, acting as pioneers.

At 6:00 AM on May 31, we departed from Lincheng. We hired a peasant to carry our luggage. There were two roads to Jizhuang. I took the highway near the railway, and the other two took the rural road. Before we had gone three miles, I discovered a local Communist unit. They entered the village and did not come out for a long time. I knew something was wrong. Fear was useless, so I ran to the village and asked others. They said they were conducting inspections inside. I went inside and was locked in a small hut (detained separately, unable to see each other). I felt suffocated in the hut! I kept peeking outside to see if there were any changes, preparing for the worst. Suddenly, a fierce-looking person with a pistol and unkempt appearance came and asked me where I was going and if I had official business. I said I was a demobilized officer from Lincheng going to Xuzhou, and my official business was a pass from the division headquarters. He also asked for my demobilization and retirement certificates and said that official business could not pass through the "peace zone," and even a three-person group with official business was invalid. What should I do? At that time, I couldn't figure out his intentions. He talked to me about "democracy," how the Communists and Nationalists were... how Jiang and Mao were... It was simply absurd, selling his fake Tongrentang plaster! He advised me not to go home and to work there, saying it was the same thing. After I repeatedly stated that I would not be a soldier and would go home to be an ordinary person, he left in anger!

Soon, another person came and talked a great deal of philosophy. One after another, it was the same routine. I got along quite well with one named Cao. To be friendly, he asked me for a pair of leather shoes. Soon, others found out and came to ask for things, so I had to painfully sacrifice. In an instant, my fountain pen, watch, towel, safety razor, shirt, shorts, etc., were no longer mine! They whispered to each other for a while and said to me that the Eighth Route Army didn't want things but had to be given money. In the end, I settled the matter by paying several thousand yuan.

Suddenly, they brought my two comrades over and made a mess of our luggage, ordering us to pack it up and send it to the Shagou district headquarters. I wondered what new tricks they had in store. A few minutes later, we were singing "Male Escort"! When we arrived at the district headquarters, they still repeated the same routine as before, performing a magic trick. At that time, we were hungry and exhausted, and seeing that it was getting dark, we were extremely anxious, feeling as if we were "homeless in the afterlife, where will we stay tonight?"

Soon, District Chief Li returned and questioned us in detail again, allowing us to pass, ordering us to spend the night in the next village. We thanked him profusely and came out, still instructing the hired man to carry the luggage. On the road, we encountered batch after batch of armed local Communists. We said we were from the district headquarters and were going to the village ahead. Fortunately, they didn't ask for protection money, otherwise, our military uniforms and quilts wouldn't have been safe!

When we arrived at the village, we discussed and pleaded with the village chief, who allowed us to stay overnight in a thatched hut with air on all sides. We also bought a few steamed buns and a bowl of millet porridge to fill our stomachs. The next morning, as soon as dawn broke, we were urged to get up. The hired man told us to cross Weishan Lake to Liguo Station, where there were no inspections by the Communist or Nationalist armies. But I was afraid of going to "Liangshan Marsh" and encountering Li Jun, the River Dragon, who would invite us to eat wontons and sword noodles. Losing our luggage was a small matter; losing our lives would be a tragedy, so I didn't dare to try. I still decided to take the highway. We passed through three checkpoints to Hanzhuang. When we reached the final警戒线, I thought we could pass, but a dozen or so bandit-like plainclothes armed comrades came up to us, equipped with machine guns, pistols, rifles, sabers, spears, etc. They yelled, asked our intentions, inspected our luggage, and then escorted us to the battalion headquarters. Two armed soldiers came and detained us separately, so we became prisoners again! In less than ten minutes, we were moved to another place of detention. This happened more than ten times, making us dizzy and feeling both amused and helpless. During this time, people kept coming to persuade us, but we ignored them all, suffering a foreign torment all night long in suspense!

The next day, they took me out for interrogation. The person asking the questions was probably a political instructor. After more than an hour, they asked if I was a student of Chairman Jiang. I replied that I came from the military and didn't understand anything. But he suddenly became solemn and said that my comrade was too disrespectful to friends. Why did he steal the meeting minutes! He put the blame of being a Nationalist agent on my head and demanded that I tell the truth immediately, otherwise, he would use the most severe methods to deal with me and押去“开火花” (take me away and torture me with hot irons). Hearing this, I felt as if cold water had been poured over my head. Who could bear it? I explained in detail the situation from the time we departed from Lincheng and passed through Shagou, and he began to half-believe me, still ordering me to be detained. At this time, my heart couldn't help but beat nervously. After fighting for eight years against the Japanese, I hadn't been killed by them, but now I was going to die at the hands of the Eighth Route Army. Wouldn't that be too unjust! But what could I do at this point? I could only leave it to fate. After three hours of mixed thoughts, I still couldn't find a way to comfort myself. At the same time, I put my life out of my mind and was ready to be killed or tortured.

At this time, a comrade came up very kindly and asked me to go outside to talk. I followed him to the office and saw my comrade sitting there, smoking leisurely. My heart suddenly felt relieved. I asked him the reason. When the local Communists in Jizhuang inspected our luggage, he accidentally dropped the meeting minutes inside. In his hurry, he didn't have time to check carefully, causing this two-day danger! Fortunately, they called and asked very clearly, otherwise, I would have probably gone to my grandma's house to celebrate the Dragon Boat Festival! After about another hour or so, the interrogating political instructor brought more than a dozen comrades out and repeatedly said, "Sorry! Sorry! Trouble, trouble!" He told us to sit down and talked for a long time about灌碱政治作用(infusing us with alkaline political ideology). Then he sent us to the battalion gate. Saying goodbye, we wiped away our sweat and hurriedly walked across the wooden bridge over the canal, entering our警戒内(patrolled area). My comrade and I couldn't help but jump up and down, cheering wildly, eight feet high, tears of joy falling down. Whew, we escaped! We were back in our safe embrace.

### I Saw Jiang Weiguo

— Bao Zhongqi

I often saw the name of Major Jiang Weiguo in the newspapers. During the fierce battles in India and Burma, his reputation was even greater. After the victory, he led his troops to Shanghai and temporarily驻扎(stationed) at the original site of Shanghai University in Yangshupu. The students all hoped to see the true face of this young hero.

Finally, Jiang Weiguo and his wife came to attend Shanghai University's weekly meeting on June 3. To the rhythm of a lively march, he and his wife walked into the auditorium and sat in the first row below the stage.

When President Ling invited him to speak, amidst the enthusiastic applause of the students, he stood up from his chair, but because the doors on both sides leading to the stage were not open, he was in a dilemma. Afterwards, he himself said: "I thought President Ling wanted to test me and let me climb onto the stage!"

Indeed, Major Jiang Weiguo was a very humorous person. After he took the stage, he first introduced himself: "My surname is Jiang, my name is Weiguo, the 'wei' of 经纬(longitude and latitude), the 'guo' of 国家(country), and I am the少校(major) of the First Detachment of the Chinese Armored Corps Training General Team." He was straightforward and not arrogant, and his clear and fluent Mandarin made the students admire him even more.

Then, as a soldier, he introduced us to some new military knowledge. He had a very detailed explanation of the origin of the name "tank," the general situation of armored兵 training, and the Yining incident in Xinjiang.

When he was saying that China urgently needed to train armored兵 talents, he immediately turned back to President Ling and explained: "Please forgive me, I am not advertising to solicit business." There was a burst of laughter from the audience.

After the meeting, the students were reluctant to leave and followed them, especially Jiang Weiguo's wife, who became the focus of the female students' attention. She nodded and thanked them with a smile. It is said that by the time the students got their cameras from the dormitory, they had already gotten into the car and left. It was a real pity!

### Four Poems on the Three Martyrs of the Late Ming Dynasty, with Preface

After the ravages of war, I happened to find Su Zigu's collected works in an old chest. Reading about the deaths of Zhang Jiayu, Chen Bangyan, and Chen Zizhuang, all loyal gentlemen who died for their principles, my heart was filled with fervent emotions and tears streamed down my face. Therefore, I took up my brush to record this, hoping to reveal even a fraction of their heroic deeds.

Iron armor and golden spears, a divine steed of yellow. Jiayu often rode a yellow horse, a swift and agile steed. Every time he faced battle, amidst the bleak wind and sand, it would rear up and neigh fiercely to boost the morale of the troops. When Jiayu died, a loyal man following him to the battlefield, the horse also threw itself into the water beside Yuanxi.

His voice remained strong even after death, his cries echoing in the setting sun and sandy winds of the desolate marsh. Jiayu fought at Zengcheng, his isolated army without reinforcements. Unwilling to be stained by enemy blood, he threw himself into a marsh to die.

The cross-river strategy came to naught, the remnants of the Central Plains were difficult to manage. His ambition did not die, but his body was shattered first. His liver and gall could still strike at treacherous officials. Bangyan was executed by dismemberment. Those who supervised the execution saw his liver suddenly leap up and strike the supervisor's face, causing him to be startled and die within a few days.

His ambition to conquer the passes and rivers in a hundred battles had not been fulfilled. Besieged in the city, he became fish on a chopping board. Fortunately, there was a brush for writing poetry in his iron-barred window. His verses were filled with fervent emotions. Bangyan was arrested and refused to eat the food offered to him. For five days in prison, he only chanted poems. If paper was given to him, he would fill it immediately. Among the poems circulated were these lines: "Great creation, many hardships, alas, the time does not favor me! Where shall my empress go? My body is in bitter suffering!" The sorrow and despair were so intense that one could not bear to finish reading.

The rolling warships surged upstream, leaving behind the regret of lost rivers and mountains on the suspicious boats. His solitary integrity, like a piece of Zhuzhou moon, illuminated the eternal sorrows of the human world. Bangyan lay in ambush in the reeds of Zhuzhou, waiting for Li Chengdong's fleet to arrive. He led his boats out to engage them briefly, burning several of their ships. Chengdong retreated westward, and Bangyan pursued him. At dusk, Chen Zizhuang could not distinguish the colors of the flags and suspected they were all enemy boats. The formation wavered, and Chengdong, with the wind at his back, pursued and inflicted a great defeat.

### "British Excrement" "American Retreat Turns Coy"

— Feng Yi

Seeing "printer's errors" in newspapers reminded me of a few old stories. Before the war, a newspaper in Guangzhou reported the arrival of the British ambassador in Hankou. The headline in large characters, "British Ambassador Arrives in Hankou," was mistakenly printed as "British Excrement Arrives in Hankou," which shocked readers. This was indeed a remarkable and ironic "printer's error."

On the eve of the Pacific War, the United States had not yet made a decision to go to war with Japan but frequently exerted pressure on Japan. It once issued an order to evacuate American residents from Japan. A newspaper in Hong Kong mistakenly printed the sub-headline "American Evacuation" as "American Retreat Turns Coy." The mistake was quite charming, as the "retreat" at the time did indeed have the diplomatic posture of a "withdrawal."

In 1943, the Hong Kong Libao was edited by Ye Lingfeng, who was in charge of "Yan Lin." At that time, a writer who had collaborated with the enemy expressed remorse. Ye wrote a short article in "Yan Lin" saying that if this person could truly repent and start anew, we should certainly not hold past offenses against them and welcome them with open arms. The printer mistakenly printed the word "arms" as "buttocks," and for a time, it was rumored that someone was "opening their buttocks to welcome" someone else. This was truly a blunder, bordering on the absurd.

A visitor came from Kunming, and in jest described the street scenes with four-character phrases. They were so vivid and apt that they were worth sharing:

Towering buildings of Nanping Street, bright and tidy Jinbi Road, the hustle and bustle of Zhengyi Road, spacious and flat Huguo Road, strangely Europeanized Xiaodong Street, beggars swarming in Tuodong Road, small and exquisite Tongren Street, luxurious restaurants lining Yongdao Street, filthy and cramped Shulin Street, rough and uneven Jiexiao Lane, the stench of Jinniu Street, rows of incense sticks on Qingyun Street, the mooing of cows and neighing of horses on Zhuji Street, street stalls occupying Wenming Street, the rural flavor of Wenque Street, dust flying on Huancheng Road, a riot of flowers near Jinri Building, the antique charm of Jinbi Fang, night market snacks on Yuxi Street, the cool breeze on the Cuihu Causeway.

### On "Zijuan"

— Cao Zuohan

Some enthusiasts of "Dream of the Red Chamber" compared Xue Baochai to Zeng Guofan and Lin Daiyu to Zuo Zongtang. And some meddling, idle literati wanted to elevate Xue Baochai to be the wife of Duke Wenzheng; this is truly a busybody's thought. Attraction between the sexes and repulsion between the same sex not only conforms to physics but also to human nature. Can people with the same character necessarily be together, and can those with the same circumstances necessarily sympathize with each other? Only because she is one of the heroines are there so many unreasonable complaints. I think there is a little maid in "Dream of the Red Chamber" who can indeed captivate the heart and make people admire her example. She is Zijuan.

If I were to draw a comparison, I would say: she is very much like Marquis Wu, Zhuge Liang.

It is said that she was originally a maid in the Jia family and later became Lin Daiyu's personal maid. This was also in accordance with Grandmother Jia's arrangement and instructions, and she was wholeheartedly loyal. Although she did not have Marquis Wu's talent to conquer the south and pacify the north, "dedicating herself to the task until her dying day," she would test with lies, receive blame, and forget herself, sharing both joy and sorrow. Until "the bitter Crimson Pearl's soul returned to the Heaven of Sorrow," she finally cut off her three thousand strands of hair to become a nun following the Fourth Young Mistress. In this, she had finally fulfilled her ambition to "die only after achieving her goal." If it were someone else, taking advantage of Bao Er's lingering affection, she would have long climbed onto a higher branch. Only Zhuge Liang would have been loyal to the helpless A Dou until death.

Someone might say, "The Dao is lost, seek it in the countryside." It is only because there is only a pair of clean stone lions in the Jia family that her nobility is highlighted. This is certainly true. Like the so-called daughters of noble families today, their moral fiber is perhaps lighter than pre-war history books. On the contrary, women from humble families, without much learning, have not forgotten all the principles of integrity and righteousness.

However: are there still people like Zijuan today? If there are, even if they are humble servants, I would be willing to serve them.

### Champion of Childhood Fitness, Now Crowned Beauty Queen

— Han Yun

Ms. Eileen Kahill, an American girl, participated in a children's health competition at the age of three and won first place.

Now, sixteen years later, her healthy physique has remained unchanged, and her beauty has made her famous in the world. In the recent "beauty pageant" in the United States, Kahill won first place.

This is what is meant by "what a child is at three, he will be all his life." Fitness always remains fitness.

### Asphalt Unafraid of Rain

— Yi

Chemists have recently discovered a substance that allows hot asphalt to adhere to wet surfaces. Asphalt originally loses its adhesive force when it comes into contact with water, but after being treated with this substance, it can firmly bond with sand and gravel. Therefore, even when it is raining heavily, this mixture can be used to pave roads. In the past, there was no way to repair roads in rainy weather. Because if the road-building materials are damp, the adhesive force will be greatly reduced, and the road surface paved with wet materials will easily crack and peel off. Therefore, road construction had to be suspended when it rained and continue when the weather cleared.

This new substance is a liquid that can be added in small quantities during asphalt refining or during application. With this substance, not only will newly built roads not be affected by wind and rain, but also work and expenses will be saved by avoiding delays while waiting for clear weather. This is a significant contribution to road administration.

Collected Snippets

### Mocking the Elderly in the Miss Hong Kong Competition

— Wuling Ren

Remembering Zhu Shaoping, I recall an old incident. Twenty years ago, I attended a gathering wearing a hat. Mr. Zhu, who was acting as a receptionist, specifically came over and asked me very politely if I wanted him to put away my hat for me. I then realized that I had not taken off my hat, and my face turned red. I was very ashamed at the time.

Hong Kong held a beauty pageant, competing for the title of Miss Hong Kong. Women of sixty years old could also participate, all required to wear swimsuits. This is simply making fun of the elderly.

A young woman's body was found floating beneath Baozhe Bridge in Wuxi. It was later learned that the deceased was named Chang Dong'e, from Suzhou. She had received a secondary education. Because her brother had served as a puppet district chief during the enemy-puppet period and had recently been arrested and sentenced, Dong'e was ashamed and sought death. Previously, there was the case of the woman who betrayed China (Shen Guiqin) seeking a divorce. Now, there is the sister of a traitor committing suicide by drowning. The two women have different goals, but the underlying cause is the same. However, the traitors themselves are often shameless during their trials, putting on an ugly performance and claiming credit. How thick is their skin?

Li Zewen, the general manager of the New New Company, was sentenced to three years in prison, and all his property was confiscated. He did not express much in court, only lightly saying "Okay." This one word "Okay" contains so many meanings: suffering, hatred, regret... It is truly, "another kind of taste in my heart."

Reading requires strong memorization, and learning dialects also requires strong memorization. Although I have traveled through seven or eight provinces, I can never learn to speak the local dialects properly. It is especially inconvenient in Hong Kong. Helpless, I can only use various idioms to memorize things, such as "haircut" being "illegal," or instructing the driver to drive straight ahead by saying "a deer," or "where" being "Bing Shu"... It is like a beginner learning English and using Chinese phonetic transcriptions in the textbook. Although clumsy, I am still able to remember a few Cantonese phrases to this day because of this. In addition, if friends' telephone numbers are only recorded in a diary, thinking that one can rely on it without worry, it is still better to memorize them. Otherwise, one has to flip through the book every time one needs to use them, which is not a good solution.

### Social Services: Answering Readers

Medical and Health

(1) Li Jianqing from Chuansha asks if you can help with a few medical questions. (1) Three years ago, I developed a strange itch on the back of my left hand with small blisters. After squeezing them, the area becomes inflamed and never scabs. The nails of my thumb and index finger have a greasy, ash-like appearance. I have asked others, and they say it is goose palm fungus. Is there any effective medicine or injection? (2) I have been married for eight years, and gave birth to a boy in the first year. However, I have not conceived since. In the 31st year, my wife learned to ride a bicycle and accidentally fell, causing pain. Her uterus often bleeds, and her menstrual cycle is irregular. I wonder if there is any danger? (3) Is there any effective medicine for premature ejaculation? Are the topical medications on the market effective? How about injecting Yokene?

[Answer by Dr. Tang Renjin, Doctor of Medicine] (1) It may be eczema. Consult a dermatologist. (2) Frequent uterine bleeding and irregular menstruation may be caused by uterine polyps or endometritis. A gynecologist should be consulted for a uterine examination. (3) There is no effective medicine for premature ejaculation. It is necessary to control sexual desire and do physical exercise. Most topical medications on the market are ineffective and harmful. Yokene injections should not be used indiscriminately and must be determined after a doctor's examination. (2) Hu Jianxiong asks. I am a 17-year-old male. Due to masturbation, my penis has become small and sometimes I have nocturnal emissions. Doctor, is there any way to restore my youth? It would be an immense merit. Also, the left testicle sometimes protrudes and swells. Is there any way to treat it?

[Answer by Dr. Tang Renjin, Doctor of Medicine] The first thing to do is to stop masturbation and prevent nocturnal emissions. Pay attention to the following points: (1) Do not overeat or drink too much in the evening. (2) The bedding should not be too heavy or thick. (3) Sleep on your side. (4) Do physical exercise. Occasional protrusion and swelling of the left testicle may be epididymitis. You should consult a doctor for diagnosis and treatment.

(3) Zhang Ziju asks: My sister lives in Pingshi, northern Guangdong. Before the victory, she lived in the deep mountains for several months to avoid the war, and she developed a goiter. The symptom is swelling of the neck. According to the local Western doctor, it is an enlargement of the thyroid gland, caused by the lack of iodine in the water there. Therefore, all the residents there suffer from this disease, which is very unsightly. It is said that women, children, and those with irritable temperaments are more likely to get this disease, and eating more fish can prevent the spread of this disease because fish contains iodine. However, it must be iron ore fish. Originally, the water in northern Guangdong does not contain iodine, and there is no saltwater fish. Therefore, I am specifically seeking a method or medicine, or effective prescription for treating this disease. I think there is no shortage of famous doctors in Shanghai. I hope you will generously give me your advice so that my sister can get rid of the disease. I would be very grateful.

[Answer by Dr. Tang Renjin, Doctor of Medicine] It is indeed goiter. You can eat more foods containing iodine, or undergo X-ray irradiation, or have surgery.

### Visiting the Family of Martyr Chen Wenqi, Sun Bingtao's Letter Reporting the Heroic Death

Dear Editor: My classmate, Chen Wenqi (Chen Yangqing), was from Shanghai. He graduated from a senior vocational school in this city and worked for the China Science Company on Foch Road. After the outbreak of the August 13th Anti-Japanese War, he and I went to the rear and enlisted in the 15th Regiment of the Military Police. Unfortunately, in the autumn of the 32nd year, when the Japanese invaded Langguang, he died on the battlefield. At that time, because the Anti-Japanese War had not yet been won, it was inconvenient to send a letter to his family. Now that the homeland has been restored, I have been transferred back to my hometown. I specifically visited his family, but I did not meet them and could not find out their whereabouts. Therefore, I am specifically writing to your newspaper to have it published, so that his family members or relatives and friends can come to my place in person to tell the story of Chen's heroic death. Then not only will his family members be extremely grateful, but Chen will also be able to rest in peace. (Reader Sun Bingtao, Correspondence address: Please forward to Mr. Shen Weimin, telephone 42001.)
