### Preliminary Agreement of the Military Group: National Army to be Reduced to Ninety Divisions, Communist Army to be Reorganized into Twenty Divisions

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 20th] The Military Group Conference of the Political Consultative Conference will hold its second meeting this afternoon. It is reported that at the first meeting, Mr. Zhang Qun first reported on the progress of the Military Three-Person Group talks, followed by Mr. Zhou Enlai's supplement. It is heard that the National Army has decided to reduce its size to ninety divisions, with 20,000 men per division, totaling 1.8 million men. The Communist Army will also be reorganized into twenty divisions, totaling 400,000 men. A preliminary agreement has been reached. As for how to implement the nationalization of the military and who will manage military and political affairs, further negotiations are needed. It is also learned that Miao Jiaming's suggestion to further reduce the aforementioned number of troops will also be discussed in the subgroup meeting. As for the Government Organization Group, subgroup negotiations have been held three times. A unanimous agreement has been reached on the need to make the country's highest policy publicly known. The Communist Party, the Youth Party, and the Democratic League have all insisted that the government must demonstrate actual democratic measures.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 21st] The National Assembly Group and the Constitutional Draft Group of the Political Consultative Conference's Subcommittee will meet at the National Government this afternoon at 3:00 PM. The Policy Guidelines Group will also meet at the Supreme National Defense Council at the same time. However, no agreement has been reached on any issues, and further negotiations are needed in each subgroup. Therefore, the general assembly will still not be held tomorrow.

### Marshall Returns to Chongqing to Continue Mediation; Mission to Shanghai Not Announced

[Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Beiping, 21st] Marshall was originally scheduled to come to Beiping today but has postponed his visit due to unforeseen circumstances.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 21st] Marshall arrived in Chongqing from Shanghai at 2:30 PM this afternoon and, besides meeting with embassy staff, had no other formal appointments.

[Central News Agency, This City] According to a report from U.S. military headquarters, U.S. Special Envoy to China, Marshal Marshall, left Shanghai at 11:30 AM yesterday and returned to Chongqing. During his two-day stay in Shanghai, he spent his time in meetings. He met several times with General Wedemeyer and Admiral Cooke, and provided instructions to senior officials of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and American businessmen with status in Shanghai. Marshall expressed his regret that he could not meet with reporters due to the short duration of his visit to Shanghai and the large number of official matters. As for the main purpose of Marshall's visit to Shanghai, it is not convenient to announce.

[United Press, Chongqing, 21st] U.S. Envoy Marshall has completed his official business in Shanghai and returned here today. Political observers believe that Marshall will mediate on the unresolved issues of the various subcommittees of the Political Consultative Conference. At the same time, the various subcommittees are continuing their efforts to resolve the issues, especially the issue of organizing the State Council. The general assembly is scheduled to close on the 23rd. If these issues do not receive outside assistance, there is little hope of resolution. When reporters asked various individuals whether Marshall could make further efforts for China's unity, they said that they would not dare trouble Marshall as long as there was hope for a solution. However, the general public believes that Marshall will do his best to reorganize the military. This issue is currently being handled by the three-person committee of Zhang Qun, Zhang Zhizhong, and Zhou Enlai.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 21st] According to official sources, Marshal Marshall has postponed his visit to Xuzhou due to official business.

### Executive Headquarters for Coordination Issues Orders to Both Armies: Order to Retreat Automatically from Conflict Zones; Completion of the Ceasefire May Take Four Months

[U.S. News Service, Beiping, 21st] The Executive Headquarters for Coordination issued its second order today, instructing the National and Communist armies in the conflict zones to cease fire and retreat a full day's journey from their respective conflict locations. The order will be enforced in both urban and rural areas, and the distance of the retreat will be at least twenty miles. The order was signed by Zheng Jiemin (representing the National Government), Ye Jianying (representing the CCP), and Robinson (U.S. military attache). Former Qian commanders were also ordered to immediately restore the positions as of midnight on January 13 after the separation of the two armies and the cessation of hostilities. The second order further implements the ceasefire agreement and supplements the procedures for dropping leaflets and dispatching mobile battlefield inspection teams. At the same time, the dropping of ceasefire leaflets was carried out on a large scale today. In thirty-one cities and towns in Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, and Jiangsu provinces, 215,000 leaflets were dropped. Other flying units will continue to drop 145,000 ceasefire leaflets and 110,000 new instructional leaflets in thirty-one cities tomorrow. [United Press, Beiping, 21st] The Military Mediation Executive Department announced today: A mobile investigation team is scheduled to be dispatched from Shanghai to Guangzhou. This is the seventh team dispatched by the executive department, and the first team to be dispatched to Jiangnan.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 20th] Today is the seventh day after the ceasefire order took effect, and reports of gunfire and urgent telegrams from both sides continue to pour in. Speculative prices are also gradually rising again, and gold has broken the 90,000 mark. However, people familiar with the political situation told reporters that the prospects for peace are still optimistic. The parties who signed the ceasefire order are all sincere. The problem is that the conflicts in various places are the result of long-term historical developments. It is impossible to expect them to stop as quickly as a group exercise. However, if mediators go to the conflict sites and personally persuade them, they can certainly pull apart the two sides that are fighting. Once a ceasefire is in place at major conflict sites, other minor conflicts can be gradually reduced until they disappear. Some people in the Executive Department estimate that it will take four months to complete the ceasefire, while optimists judge that two months will be enough. If the three-person group in Chongqing can achieve good results, then this time will be further shortened. Currently, there are six "peacekeeping" groups that have set out: Jining, Chifeng, Zhangjiakou, Datong, Jinan, and Xuzhou. According to Mr. Butian, the American representative of the news group, the work of each group is going quite smoothly and there are no difficulties as imagined. The government and the Communist army are both very enthusiastic in their hospitality, but details have not yet been released. Reporters have also learned from other sources that, in the Chifeng area, in addition to the first plane being detained by the local Soviet troops due to a misunderstanding, the planes that have gone in the past two or three days have all received assistance from the Soviet troops. One or two more of these peacekeeping groups will be dispatched in the next few days. In addition to the American personnel, who have reached 125, the government and Communist Party personnel of the Executive Department have not yet arrived in full. Nearly 100 government personnel have arrived, but only 30 Communist Party personnel. Due to the shortage of manpower, work has not yet been fully launched. Most of the people who have come to Beiping work more than ten hours a day. The "219" and "209" rooms of the government and the "108" and "118" rooms of the Communist Party in the Beijing Hotel are lit all night long, which shows the intensity and hardship of their work. Although there are not many Communist Party personnel who have arrived, they have been transferred from Chongqing, Yanan, and Shanghai. It is said that there are many first-class talents, which may symbolize the sincerity of the Communist side. The three parties in the Executive Department get along very well. Every decision is made in a round table meeting. Ji Zepu, the government official in charge of the news group, also urged reporters to carefully release news and not to provoke the Communist side, which shows the harmony and determination of both sides to succeed. In addition to Miss Gong Peng, another propaganda person from the Communist Party has recently arrived, namely Qiao Mu, who writes international papers (Editor's note: Gong is Qiao's wife).

### Nie Rongzhen Discusses Peace While Receiving Delegation Representatives

[United Press, Chongqing, 20th] Zhou Enlai said today that military conflicts in various places have ceased seven days after the issuance of the ceasefire order between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party.

[Associated Press, Zhangjiakou, 20th] Nie Rongzhen, Commander-in-Chief of the Communist Army in the five provinces of North China (including Pan Yang and Yingkou), declared at a banquet for the three-person inspection team tonight that he was willing to fully support the peace efforts of the Coordination and Execution Department in Beiping. Nie then gave a statement to news reporters, saying, "I am convinced that General Marshall is now working for peace in China. The Communist Party supports peace, needs peace, and hopes to achieve lasting peace." This morning, General Nie hosted the American and Kuomintang representatives of the inspection team to discuss the implementation of the "ceasefire order" in his jurisdiction.

### Zhu Jiahua Reports at the Standing Committee of the People's Political Council

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 21st] The Standing Committee of the People's Political Council held its fourteenth meeting at 9:00 AM on the 21st. The presidium members Wang Yunwu, Jiang Yong, Mo Dehui, and council members Yin Shuxian, Wu Zhaoxu, Qian Gonglai, Wang Puhan, Fan Yusui, Xu Deheng, Chen Qitian, Chu Fucheng, Zhou Binglin, Huang Yanpei, Xu Xiaoyan, Chen Bosheng, Hu Lin, Zuo Shunsheng, Li Huang, Luo Heng, Fu Sinian, Kong Geng, Hu Jianzhong, Zhang Junmai, and Dong Biwu, Secretary-General Shao Lizi, and Deputy Secretary-General Dang Zhen attended. Chairman Mo Dehui presided over the meeting. First, Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua reported on the receiving and processing of education in the recovered areas after the education rehabilitation conference was convened on September 20 of last year and the specific rehabilitation plan was decided. He gave a concise explanation of the organization of teacher screening, the establishment of temporary university cram schools, the handling of graduates and unemployed and out-of-school youth in the occupied areas, and the rehabilitation work of the schools that moved inland during the war. After Zhu's report, council members Chu Fucheng, Xu Deheng, Qian Gonglai, Yin Shuxian, Luo Heng, Fu Sinian, Xu Xiaoyan, Chen Qitian, etc., raised many questions on the damage to various schools in the occupied areas, the fees charged by private schools, and other issues, which Zhu answered one by one. Then, military inspection representatives were elected, and proposals were discussed: (1) Qian Gonglai and other five council members proposed that Anhui province is experiencing a shortage of grain due to the grain department's procurement. They requested the government to correct it quickly in order to pacify the people. It was resolved to submit it to the government for prompt correction. (2) Leng Tong and other twelve council members proposed that the local political and military expenses of various recovered counties in Jiangsu and Zhejiang are raised by the local governments, which the people cannot bear. They proposed requesting the central government to return all the local advances and that all political and military expenses be paid by the central government in the future in order to relieve the people's difficulties. It was resolved to submit it to the government for prompt investigation and handling. Finally, a temporary motion by council member Fu Sinian was passed, requesting Chairman Mo Dehui to represent the People's Political Council in comforting the people of the Northeast when he next goes to the Northeast.

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 19th] The news that the city of Hunyuan in Yanbei was captured by the Communist army was announced by the command headquarters on the evening of the 19th. The Communist army attacking Tan Di consisted of more than 16,000 men transferred from Yanggao, Tianzhen, and Guangling, including more than 600 Japanese communists, equipped with 70-80 light and heavy machine guns, and 6-7 cannons. They began attacking the city at 11:00 PM on the 15th. By dawn on the 16th, the southwest of the city was breached by the Communist army. For the sake of self-defense, the National Army withdrew from the east gate after fierce street fighting and advanced northward. They were ambushed multiple times along the way, resulting in more than 380 casualties.

### Agricultural Loans for Recovered Areas: 2 Billion Yuan to be Released Soon

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 21st] After the victory last year, the government allocated 400 million yuan to recovered areas as emergency agricultural loans, which will be loaned out in stages. The first phase of 100 million yuan has already been loaned out to Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Hunan, and other provinces after their recovery. The second phase of 100 million yuan was also released in the middle of this month and distributed to more than ten recovered provinces such as Hebei, Shandong, Guangdong, and Henan as funds for farmers to purchase cattle, seeds, fertilizers, and farm tools. The remaining 200 million yuan will be loaned out recently.

### Construction of Ping Shan Airport in Hong Kong Temporarily Suspended Armed Protection

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 21st] The Hong Kong New Territories authorities unreasonably erected an airport in Ping Shan, destroying dozens of villages in the area. After the villagers appealed to the whole country, it aroused opposition from the Chinese people. The New Territories Joint Village Representatives Deng Songnian and Zhong Shaoting came to the province to coordinate. In addition to sending telegrams to our supreme leader and allied political figures, our diplomatic commissioner Guo Dehua also argued against the airport. The Hong Kong authorities have agreed to request instructions from the British government, and armed protection of the Ping Shan airport construction has been temporarily suspended.

### Betts Says U.S. Military Will Temporarily Remain in China to Promote Stability and Peace; Sending Japanese Troops for Transfer to China

[Associated Press, Tianjin, 21st] Betts, a Republican member of the House Naval Affairs Subcommittee, is one of the ten members of the Navy and Agriculture Committees sent to North China to inspect the situation of the Marines. The delegation left Washington on January 5 and visited Okinawa and Japan. They have now come to China to inspect the Tenth Marine Division in Qingdao and the First Marine Division in Tianjin. Betts said, "The Marines have transferred the work of returning Japanese troops to the Chinese government, but this mission in China is not complete. While the good offices of the U.S. government are being used to promote a peaceful compromise between the two major forces in China, the Marines will remain in China for a longer period as a stabilizing military force. We seek lasting peace in the world, and we believe that another world struggle may be brewing if we do not lend a helping hand."

[United Press, Tianjin, 21st] Betts, a member of the House Naval Affairs Committee, announced today that the committee is focusing on four major issues: (1) disposal of surplus naval materials, (2) inspection of Pacific naval facilities, (3) troop demobilization, and (4) the general situation in the Pacific occupation or recovered areas. The length of time the U.S. military will remain in China will depend on how well China can cooperate in building a government that guarantees world peace and prevents future wars.

### Soviet Troops to Withdraw from Chengde and Chifeng Immediately; Northeast Industrial and Mining Issues Not Agreed Upon; Specific Issues and Details Still to be Discussed

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, Promoted Date] Authoritative sources say: The Soviet army in Chengde and Chifeng will withdraw today. The national army has arrived near the area and is preparing to take over defense duties from the Soviet army. Yingkou is a port received by the national army from the Soviet army, which was captured by the Communist army a few days ago. Authoritative sources did not explain the current situation in the area and the landing of the New Sixth Army in Huludao. The Soviet army in Changchun and Shenyang has made preparations for withdrawal, but the defense duties have not been formally handed over by both sides. Previous news from Changchun said that the Soviet army would withdraw from Changchun on the 20th, which is still too early to say. Our national army arriving in Shenyang can utilize the Changchun Railway to transport troops to Changha and other places for taking over defense duties. The date of February 1 for the Soviet army's withdrawal from the Northeast can be expected to no longer be delayed. Director Xiong was originally scheduled to return to Beiping today, but has postponed his return due to unfinished business there. On the eve of the Soviet army's withdrawal from the Northeast, Madam Chiang Kai-shek visited the Northeast border as the wife of the head of state to comfort and bid farewell to the Soviet army generals and soldiers who have successfully withdrawn from liberating the Northeast. There is no good news about the takeover of Andong. It is not that it cannot be taken over, but that there are difficulties in the takeover. And the Soviet army can do nothing about it. As for the industrial and mining issues, Chiang Ching-kuo may have reached some principles with the Soviet side in Moscow, and some specific issues and details still need to be discussed in Changchun. It is reported that the intermittent Sino-Soviet industrial and mining negotiations have lasted for several months, and at one point involved light industry, but the recent negotiations have been limited to heavy industry (Editor's note: The above is a conversation between a responsible person of the Xingying and a reporter from this newspaper, but he did not want to reveal his name).

[Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 21st] Zhou Zhizou flew to Jinzhou at noon on the 21st to inspect the air force base and meet with Xiong and Du to convey important instructions from the central government. He returned to Beiping on the same plane that day.

### Guo Taiqi Said to be Appointed to England

[Our Newspaper News] A local diplomat revealed yesterday that after Wei Daoming returned to China, it was rumored in Chongqing political circles that the ambassador to the United States would be succeeded by Gu Weijun. The selection of a candidate for Gu's lost position as ambassador to England has become the focus of discussion. Guo Taiqi previously held the position for many years and had a very harmonious relationship with the British government and the public. He is currently living in leisure in the countryside of Chongqing and has a good chance of being selected.

### The Tense Situation in Kaifeng Has Passed; Communist Army in Northern Shanxi Captures Hunyuan County

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] Xuzhou telephone: More than 10,000 members of the Yubei militia have been fighting hard on the northeast sides of Fengqiu. The tense atmosphere towards the citizens in the past two days has passed. The military and police are making serious preparations to prevent petty thieves. The curfew time has been advanced. Trains from Kaifeng to Zhengzhou and from Kaifeng to Xinxiang are running as usual, and the people are still at ease.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] Xuzhou telephone: The Communist army, which was causing trouble in Fengqiu in northern Henan, was stopped by the local team at Zhoucun, 60 miles from Kaifeng, on the 19th. On the morning of the 20th, reinforcements were added to attack south. They are now engaged in fierce fighting with the Yubei militia. Also, the Communist army operating along the eastern section of the Longhai Railway, in order to support the offensive of the Yubei Communist army, has dismantled the railway tracks of about 30 miles from Huangkou Station to Licun Station between Kaifeng and Xuzhou. The tracks near Lanfeng have also been destroyed. Since the Japanese surrender, the traffic on the Bianxu section has been destroyed by the Communist army 83 times. The loyal and outstanding road workers are still desperately rushing to repair it.

### All False Lawyers and Accountants Will Have Their Qualifications Revoked

And those who are reported to have aided the enemy with evidence will be prosecuted.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] Chongqing News: In order to strictly prevent free professionals such as lawyers, accountants, doctors, and journalists who have aided the enemy with evidence of serious crimes from entering various institutions under false names to hide, the Executive Yuan and various courts are now formulating strict reporting measures based on various investigations to warn against treachery. It is heard that all false lawyers and false accountants who have registered with the puppet government and obtained certificates will have their qualifications revoked.

### Recent Situation in Taiwan

— Zeng Jingke

Two weeks after Japan's unconditional surrender, the Taiwan Governor-General's Office had no choice but to announce it via broadcast because the truth could no longer be concealed. Almost every household in Taiwan had a radio (before the war, when I was in Tokyo, a regular radio cost only three yen, equivalent to two yuan and forty fen in our currency). So, this good news spread throughout Taiwan immediately, sparking thunderous cheers. Makeshift national flags of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth were waving everywhere. Initially, because the formal surrender hadn't happened yet, the Japanese military and civilians, out of embarrassment and anger, forbade celebrations and gatherings, and in some places, the national flags were even torn down by Japanese police. But a few days later—when the Japanese military and civilians realized that the "Imperial Army" had already collapsed and their dreams of aggression were shattered—they not only allowed the Taiwanese people to celebrate wildly but also, unprecedentedly and unequivocally, practiced "friendship" with them! They even hoped and pleaded for the "cooperation" of the Taiwanese people! Although the date of the formal surrender was still far off at that time.

Also, because we were too late in accepting the surrender, some losses and disputes occurred in Taiwan that could have been avoided. When the officials we sent to receive Taiwan's military and political affairs arrived after a long delay, it not only added many insurmountable difficulties, but also, because of this, the task of acceptance still cannot be completed. The true completion of this task, based on my personal observation as a reporter, will probably not be possible until at least half a year later:

First, the Japanese military and civilians, during the nearly two months of being already surrendered but not yet disarmed, arbitrarily provoked discord among the Taiwanese people, saying that they "obeyed the Emperor's order to liberate Taiwan and were all going to return to their farms; from now on, the Taiwanese people could be free; but China would soon send troops to conquer Taiwan, so the Taiwanese people would become slaves of China." Taiwan had been occupied by the enemy for as long as fifty years, and the Taiwanese people had been separated from the motherland for fifty years, so they were naturally skeptical of this last-minute goodwill from the Japanese military and civilians. The Japanese army also sold light weapons to the Taiwanese people cheaply, deliberately planting the seeds of disaster. Their treacherous intentions are truly hateful!

Second, when our receiving personnel arrived in Taiwan, it was already impossible to receive the military with a swift and decisive manner, so naturally, it was also impossible to immediately receive the political affairs. Moreover, the Taiwanese people did not understand Mandarin and Chinese, and most of the receiving personnel did not understand Taiwanese and Japanese, so the difficulties were naturally even greater.

Third, among the national army and military police stationed in Taipei, it is said that some people's behavior gave the Taiwanese people a bad impression, thereby providing the Japanese military and civilians with an excuse to undermine the feelings between the compatriots and the motherland, which led to the discovery of assassination squads jointly formed by Japanese and Taiwanese ruffians, and consequently, personnel from both the military and political receiving sides have gone missing.

General Chen Gongxia, the Chief Executive of Taiwan, is the most suitable candidate for governing Taiwan; based on his past achievements in governing Fujian, his future success in governing Taiwan can be guaranteed. I dare say: in today's Taiwan, no one but Chief Executive Chen can govern. Naturally, in today's Taiwan, no one but Chief Executive Chen can govern well. The difficulties mentioned above, except for those that are insurmountable but have already passed, I believe that Chief Executive Chen will definitely gradually find ways to overcome them. But in my personal humble opinion, those governing Taiwan should first pay attention to the following points:

1. After the complete military takeover, the first thing to do is to find a way to send more than 200,000 Japanese soldiers back to their country, and then find a way to send more than 300,000 Japanese residents back to their country.

2. After sending the Japanese military and civilians back to their country, immediately conduct a strict investigation and registration of weapons in the hands of the civilians, and find a way to concentrate and manage these weapons, either by providing compensation.

3. Carefully formulate a plan for governing Taiwan, and by no means make the Taiwanese people feel that things are worse now than they were before.

4. Carefully select the cadres for governing Taiwan, and by no means make the Taiwanese people lament that all crows in the world are equally black.

5. Do not use Japanese staff at all, and by no means allow the Taiwanese people and Japanese to criticize that Taiwan cannot be governed without the Japanese.

If these few points can be done surely and quickly, then not only will Taiwan be easy to govern, but it will definitely be governed well; otherwise, there will be no way to govern it. Chief Executive Chen recently reported his policy outline at an enlarged memorial week, saying: "In the active aspect, we must achieve (1) equality in education and service opportunities; (2) the establishment of genuine public opinion institutions; (3) raising the living standards of the people. In the passive aspect, we must achieve (1) reorganizing finances and reducing harsh taxes; (2) re-examining laws and regulations; (3) protecting the legitimate rights of the people."

This can certainly be considered a wise policy, but if I do not first achieve the few humble opinions that I have contributed earlier, then this kind of wise policy seems not easy to realize.

In addition, regarding the recent situation in Taiwan that I know about, there are still the following points that I can report to the people of the country:

(1) Taiwan is very close to Fuzhou and Xiamen, and can be reached every other day. Unfortunately, there is still no formal navigation to this day, and merchants travel by sailing boats, which are very dangerous in the event of a strong wind. In the past month, there have been frequent reports of capsized sailing boats. Last night, I received another telegram from the business community that three sailing boats loaded with goods from Keelung to Fuzhou capsized not far from Keelung due to unfavorable wind direction and failure to lower the sails in time. It is hoped that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company can find a way to open shipping lines between Taiwan and other places as soon as possible.

(2) There are quite a few talented people in Taiwan. Most of the Taiwanese compatriots I know have received higher education, with the majority studying natural sciences. If used properly, these talents are all excellent cadres for building a new Taiwan. Because Taiwan has been under Japanese rule for as long as fifty years, people who study social sciences are considered more dangerous, so very few study them. However, there are many talents in the field of social sciences in various provinces of our country, and the personnel needed in Taiwan in the future can be exchanged with various provinces.

(3) Although very few Taiwanese young people can understand Mandarin, very few can even fully understand Taiwanese; what they learn and use is Japanese. This is the result of fifty years of slavish education, and it is not surprising. Therefore, Chief Executive Chen plans to make all Taiwanese young people understand Mandarin within four years. Even if it is not easy to universalize, it is by no means something that is absolutely impossible to do; as long as they can truly work hard, four years is not a short time.

(4) The aboriginal tribes of Taiwan all have a sense of nationhood. Japan ruled Taiwan for fifty years, but they never submitted. After Taiwan's recovery, they sent representatives such as Lumo to visit Chief Executive Chen, expressing their willingness to move to the plains and assimilate with the Taiwanese people. They are also preparing to organize a visiting delegation to visit the capital, pay homage to Sun Yat-sen's mausoleum, and have an audience with the head of state.

(5) Taiwan still uses the Taiwan dollar, and the exchange rate between the Taiwan dollar and the legal tender has not yet been determined, but it is roughly equivalent to customs gold units. Merchants all load goods from Fuzhou to sell in Taiwan, and then buy goods back after selling them. If there are no accidental losses in one round trip, one yuan can become five yuan. Although sea travel is dangerous, there are still many people coming and going. Recently, Chief Executive Chen ordered that gold and sugar are not allowed to be exported. However, merchants are resourceful, and there are still many who go to Taiwan to barter.

(6) There used to be many kinds of newspapers in Taiwan, with the "Taiwan Daily News" having the widest circulation. The "Taiwan Daily News" has now been taken over by our side and reorganized into the "New Life Daily," which still has a page printed in Japanese (similar to the "Shanghai Daily News" run by the Japanese in Shanghai before the war) to help the Taiwanese people understand current events. The "Xingnan New Daily" has now been renamed "Minbao." There is still no official party newspaper. Chief Executive Chen said that Taiwan should have a party newspaper, which will either be run by someone sent by the Central Propaganda Department in the future, or by the Taiwan Provincial Party Headquarters.

(7) Taiwanese Li Youbang graduated from the first class of the Whampoa Military Academy. Since 1926, he has served as a special commissioner of the Taiwan Provincial Party Headquarters. After the Anti-Japanese War, he organized the Taiwan Volunteer Corps, and the Military Affairs Commission appointed him as the commander of the corps. I received a letter from him yesterday, saying that he will cross to Taiwan from Xiamen today, and I heard that he will serve as the Executive Secretary of the Taiwan Branch of the Three Principles of the People Youth League. Sent on December 17th.

### Jinpu Railway Actively Under Repair; Dismantling the Nanjing-Wuhu Railway Tracks to Meet Urgent Needs

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] The important project of repairing the Jinpu Railway has been actively launched. The tracks of the Jiangnan Railway from Nanjing to Wuhu have begun to be dismantled to meet the urgent needs of the Jinpu Railway. Vice Minister of Transportation Ling Hongxun will head north before the closing of the Highway Conference to supervise the road repairs.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 20th] The situation of transportation destruction in North China has not decreased recently. On the 18th, three trains on the Pinghan Line in Gaobeidian were destroyed by Communist landmines, causing many casualties. Several sections north of Qiancang County on the Jinpu Line have also been destroyed, so it is impossible to reach Cang County. The Ministry of Communications has launched railway repair work and has formed a "rush team" to repair the damaged railways, and another "emergency repair team" to repair temporary damage at any time, in order to complete all repairs within the time limit set by the government.

### Disagreement with Left-Wing Cabinet Members; De Gaulle Suddenly Resigns; Three Parties to Form a Coalition Government

[Our Report] According to a London broadcast on the 21st: French Interim President Charles de Gaulle suddenly resigned on Sunday. The French government has decided to hold an emergency meeting tomorrow to elect a new interim president to replace De Gaulle. (See the third page for De Gaulle's brief biography.)

[Our Report] According to a Paris broadcast on the 21st: The three major political parties in France, namely the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and the Catholic Party, although they have had long-standing disputes in the past, there is now hope for the three parties to form a coalition government tonight. According to French Foreign Minister Bidault, "We will soon form a three-party coalition government."

[Associated Press, Paris, 20th] French Interim President Charles de Gaulle's secretary, Barroski, announced today that President de Gaulle has resigned due to a dispute with left-wing cabinet members over military spending. The cabinet discussed the matter for four hours. The Communist Party and the Socialist Party insisted on reducing the army's budget by another 20%, but Army Minister Michelet refused. De Gaulle supported the Army Minister and, due to the international situation, also refused to approve the reduction. Now his intention to resign is firm and irreversible.

[United Press, Paris, 21st] Since General de Gaulle resigned on Sunday, France has fallen into a state of political chaos without a head of government. The Communist Party requested tonight that its leader, Thorez, be elected as the new President of France. After several meetings with the leaders of the People's Republican Party and the Socialist Party, Communist Party Secretary-General Duclos said that the Communist Party demanded to obtain the leadership position of the new coalition government. The Communist Party is the largest political party in France, but its power is too weak without the joint organization of a government by another major party.

[Reuters, Paris, 21st] After General de Gaulle resigned as head of government, the Communist Party, which has the strongest power in Parliament, seems to be launching rapid steps to resolve the crisis. Communist Party leader Thorez will consult with the Progressive Catholic Party and the Socialist Party today to form a three-party coalition government, with Thorez himself as the head. If that fails, the Radical Party will join the Socialist Party-Communist Party united front, and then the seat of head of government may fall to Herriot, the former Prime Minister of the Radical Party. Sources said that General de Gaulle is scheduled to leave Paris tonight, and his original broadcast for tonight has been canceled.

### UN Committees to Convene This Week; Atomic Energy Commission Established

[Our Report] According to a London broadcast on the 21st: The powerful Political and Security Committee of the United Nations General Assembly unanimously passed the recommendation to establish an Atomic Energy Commission today. This recommendation was provided by the Three Great Powers Foreign Ministers Conference last month. The vote in favor was as high as 46 votes, and there were no dissenting votes. Only the Philippines refused to vote. The committee will include delegations from the Security Council, plus Canada.

[Associated Press, London, 20th] The speeches by the representatives of the United Nations General Assembly have been completed for six days, and after Iran applied to the Security Council for mediation of the dispute with the Soviet Union, they were declared closed. From now on, the United Nations organization will seriously deal with thorny issues. The establishment of the Atomic Energy Management Committee, the handling of refugee issues and trusteeship issues, and secondary proposals are being drafted by the competent committee. Although the representatives of the major powers have discussed the Iranian issue, the election of the Secretary-General of the United Nations organization, with an annual salary of US$25,000, must also be finalized through off-site negotiations. At least six committees will meet daily this week, and the General Assembly itself plans to hold an extraordinary meeting on Thursday. The Security Council should meet this week, and the Economic and Social Council is scheduled to hold its first meeting on Wednesday. In addition, the issue of new members in Europe joining the United Nations organization is expected to be raised in the General Assembly as soon as possible. The United Kingdom announced today in the Membership Qualifications Review Committee that there are 13 countries in Europe that should be allowed to join, and France agreed with the United Kingdom's proposal to approve them as soon as possible. Once the qualifications of new members in Western Europe are approved, the Soviet Union will also apply for the admission of the Baltic countries.

[Reuters, London, 21st] The agenda of the United Nations General Assembly this week will give top priority to the control of atomic energy. The report of the Atomic Energy Commission can be submitted to the General Assembly at that time, and the small countries will finally have the opportunity to express their opinions on this terrible power. The United Nations General Assembly has now turned to the discussion of practical issues, so the absence of Soviet Deputy Foreign Ministers Molotov and Vyshinsky is indeed influential. Vyshinsky's whereabouts are unknown. Yesterday, it was learned that he could arrive in London that day, but he still did not appear. The Soviet Union is clearly extremely concerned about Iran's formal request to the Security Council to investigate the Azerbaijan incident. Indian Chief Representative Mudaliar is expected to be elected as the chairman, and the Trusteeship Committee will also meet at the beginning of this week. However, the formal establishment of the Trusteeship Council may have to wait until the General Assembly to be convened in April this year. According to the charter, the Trusteeship Council must wait until the trust territory is ready to be governed by it before it can be actually established. British Prime Minister Attlee may reiterate the trusteeship issue when the British Parliament resumes this week.

[Associated Press, London, 20th] Irdil, director of the press office of the Turkish delegation to the United Nations General Assembly, announced yesterday: If the Soviet Union, based on the recommendations of two Georgian professors, demands that Turkey cede 12,500 square miles of Black Sea territory near the Armenian Soviet Republic, Turkey will resist. Turkey has not yet raised any difficulties with the United Nations organization, but if any issues involving the United Nations Charter arise in the future, it will definitely seek a solution within this organization.

[United Press, London, 21st] Australian representative Makin, chairman of the United Nations Security Council, hopes to obtain a decision today on how and when the Council will consider Iran's request for an investigation into Soviet interference in Iran's internal affairs. He does not hope to convene an extraordinary meeting of the Council, but plans to raise this issue at the next regular meeting.

### Failure of Negotiations with the Soviet Union; Iranian Prime Minister Resigns

Iran and the Soviet Union May Reopen Negotiations

[Associated Press, Iranian Capital, 21st] Iranian Prime Minister Hakimi announced last night that negotiations with the Soviet Union on the Azerbaijan Province incident had failed and immediately resigned. Hakimi's resignation was predictable last week. At that time, he declared to the parliament that the government's foreign policy had failed, and the efforts to negotiate with the Soviet Union were of no avail. He planned to submit the Iranian-Soviet dispute to the United Nations organization. According to Hakimi today, "I have informed the King that I will submit the Iranian case to the United Nations General Assembly, and I am now preparing to step down."

[Associated Press, London, 21st] The Iranian representative to the United Nations General Assembly said today that after Iranian Prime Minister Hakimi resigned, Iran and the Soviet Union may conduct direct negotiations to resolve their disputes.

[Reuters, German Guan, 21st] Iranian Minister of Posts and Telegraphs and Mayor of German Guan, Naliman, resigned as minister to Prime Minister Hakimi last night, which is the fourth change in Hakimi's cabinet in a month.

### Greek People Demonstrate Against Imperialism

[United Press, Athens, 20th] The Democratic Political Alliance held a mass rally here today, with 300,000 people attending. This is the largest demonstration in Greece's history. At that time, Greek leaders claimed that the only meaning of King George's return to Athens was revolution, and they denounced foreign interference, saying that it insulted the self-esteem of the Greek people. The mass rally passed three resolutions: First, to demand that democratic parties unite against imperialism. Second, to purge all reactionary and Quisling elements in the army, police, and government agencies. Third, to demand the formation of a democratic coalition government and allow the people's resistance movement to participate in it.

### Australian Wool Donated to Gandhi

[Reuters, London, 21st] According to a Melbourne radio broadcast, the Australian Wool Industry Association sent experts to carefully select 25 pounds of super clean wool to donate to Gandhi for weaving shawls. The batch of wool is scheduled to be flown to India from Melbourne today. The proposer of this proposal is the Governor of Bengal, Khan, who will give this wool to Gandhi's maid for weaving before leaving India. Another batch of gifts, totaling 200 bags of wool, will soon be transported to India and distributed to various village weaving mills in Bengal.

### US National Steel Industry Begins Unprecedented Strike Yesterday Afternoon; Over 1.6 Million Participants; US Overall Productivity Will Be Severely Affected

[Associated Press, Pittsburgh, 21st] 750,000 steelworkers began a strike at midnight today (1:00 PM Shanghai time) to demand higher wages. The total number of striking workers in the United States has thus reached over 1.6 million, setting an unprecedented record. 1,300 factories in 33 states have all been shut down. Steel factory owners and steelworkers are now just beginning their final struggle. No one is willing to speculate on when the strike can end. Before the strike, work in various factories was already slow, and a few factories had completely shut down even before the formal announcement of the strike. Murray, President of the Congress of Industrial Organizations of America and President of the Steelworkers Union, has gone to Washington to personally lead the demand for wage increases. Murray has not expressed his opinion on the strike situation, but he plans to broadcast to the country tonight. Small, director of the Civilian Production Administration, is preparing to order that civilian and military factories no longer have the right to purchase steel with priority. It is expected that most factories will be shut down within two weeks due to lack of steel. According to Washington news, the meatpacking plants in 30 states that have gone on strike may be placed under government management.

[Reuters, New York, 21st] News from Washington reports that the government is now considering taking over meatpacking plants this week to prevent the interruption of meat consumption by civilians. If the steel strike shows no sign of resolution by next week, the government may take over the steel factories at that time. As of this morning, there has been no news of disturbances. However, judging from the situation, the company and the union are expected to argue over who will send people into the factory to maintain order. Today, neither the union, the company, nor the government side harbors the hope that the strike will be resolved soon. This strike is very detrimental to the US economy. It is estimated that 40% of overall productivity will be affected by the strike. The number of striking workers in the United States has now increased to 1,657,000, and 400,000 shipbuilding workers may also strike at the end of the week.

Short commentary

### De Gaulle Suddenly Resigns

A telegram from Paris reports that General Charles de Gaulle, the Provisional President of France, abruptly resigned over disagreements with left-wing cabinet members regarding French military preparations, and his intention to resign is very firm. The telegram did not provide many details, but the general political sentiment in France is that General de Gaulle's resignation will be permanent. Although this news came suddenly, it was not entirely unexpected. Since the establishment of the Fourth Republic government, the French Communist Party has been considering subverting the coalition government to expand its power and had long intended to force De Gaulle to resign. However, the first election under the Fourth Republic government did not give left-wing parties, including the Communist Party, an absolute majority. Instead, a coalition government was formed by the three parties with the most votes: the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and the Popular Republican Movement. The Popular Republican Movement, with its Catholic base, has fundamental differences in political views with the Communist Party, making the Socialist Party a crucial swing vote. This political change in France is due to the collusion between the Socialist Party and the Communist Party. Although the future evolution of the French political situation is unpredictable, this political change undoubtedly represents the rise of left-wing political parties in France. However, we cannot ignore another fact: the Popular Republican Movement, representing French interests, remains a major force under the Fourth Republic.

General de Gaulle's efforts for France should be immortalized in French history. Although some criticize him for being stubborn, which has caused many unpleasant events in international relations, including the recent Bertin affair in China, his efforts to restore France's past glory should be praised by the world. His high domestic and international reputation is unmatched by any other French person. Although he has expressed a firm intention to resign, according to a United Press dispatch from Paris, some believe that the situation may not be so dire within eight days, and there are reasons for this. The French Third Republic had 108 changes of government in its 58-year lifespan, averaging three per year. We hope that the politics of the Fourth French Republic can stabilize, as this is of great importance to the European situation and world peace.

### President Truman's Message to Congress Reports on Foreign and Domestic Affairs; Will Use All Efforts to Support UN Organizations; Fully Utilize Opportunities to Foster Economic Expansion

[Reuters, Washington, 21st] President Truman presented a "State of the Union" message to Congress on the 21st (American time, Eastern time being the 22nd), emphasizing that the United States has the responsibility to assist UN organizations in achieving world cooperation and lasting peace, and warning the American people not to ignore the serious post-war problems due to vast commercial prospects and opportunities. The message places the task of the UN organization's success largely on the United States. The message stated: "We can build a lasting peace on the foundation of victory, enabling greater freedom and security for people at home and around the world. I have decided to combine the traditional State of the Union message with the annual budget request, which includes not only estimates for projects already authorized by Congress but also estimates for projects I propose to initiate. Modern government has an increasingly important responsibility to foster economic expansion and ensure full utilization of opportunities, so it is necessary to formulate government procedures based on the overall national economic situation. As this year begins, the United States is strong and confident, with a record of great achievements in solving various problems and adapting to various opportunities. We have countless advantages, such as vast natural resources, huge factory equipment, superior technology and management skills, and capable citizens. In the immediate future, the commercial outlook is generally very favorable, to the point that there is a risk that our serious post-war problems may be overlooked. Therefore, we must proceed with foresight and steady steps, taking care to avoid mistakes and not being misled by the prospect of prosperity, forgetting the fundamental complexity of modern affairs. Our country has always been a place where people around the world who want to become part of us can find great opportunities, and now our country has a great responsibility to all the people of the world. We must resolutely recognize and address these responsibilities. Advances in science, communication, and transportation have made the world a family, and the economic and political health of each country in the world directly affects the economic and political health of every other country. Centuries of evolution have brought us into a new era in world history, and the interrelationships between countries must develop in complex new ways. The newly established UN organization is only the basic beginning, and it must be developed rapidly. For example, economic cooperation should now be handled as carefully and comprehensively as political security measures. It is important for countries to gather and participate in the General Assembly and the Security Council, but this is not enough. To achieve security, in addition to consultation and proper governance, we should develop UN organizations to become representatives of a unified world. As we enter a new era of international relations, we have many new responsibilities. The power, intelligence, and wisdom of our government and people should be concentrated and dedicated to international action."

[Central News Agency, Washington, 21st] The US President sent a message to Congress today, outlining the United States' general plans and budget, and reviewing its foreign and domestic policies. Truman broke with the tradition of sending separate State of the Union and budget messages and combined them into one, presenting the budget simultaneously to accommodate its foreign and domestic plans. Most of the message concerned foreign policy issues. Truman reiterated the twelve points of foreign policy he outlined in his Navy Day speech on October 27th of last year. It is said that the long-term and significant goal of American foreign policy is to establish and maintain a just peace. Our basic policy towards the Far East is to encourage the establishment of a strong, independent, unified, and democratic China, which is the traditional policy of the United States. The President then pointed out that the United States' goal is to restore Korean sovereignty as soon as possible and to establish a government freely chosen by the Korean people. In his statement on Far Eastern foreign policy, the President reviewed the United States' position in the Yalta, Potsdam, and Moscow conferences. He particularly emphasized the importance of the United States' participation in various international conferences and organizations to seek world security and prosperity, and reiterated that the United States' continued full support for the United Nations is part of its foreign policy. He assured that the United States will use its full strength to support and develop the United Nations organization to prevent international war. The United States' foreign economic policy is to promote its own prosperity and assist in the recovery and development of world markets, thereby contributing to world peace and security. The United States will ensure relief and assistance to war-torn areas, assist in their reconstruction and development, and expand world trade. He also warned that the smooth implementation of foreign economic policy depends on domestic policies to maintain full production and employment, and emphasized that a serious economic downturn in the United States would be enough to undermine the economic structure of the entire world. Some observers believe that today's message is a precursor to the annual national income budget that will be stipulated in the future Full Employment Act.

### MacArthur Orders Seizure of Japanese Aircraft Factories for Reparations

[United Press, Tokyo, 21st] General MacArthur today ordered the seizure of 394 aircraft factories and wartime experimental laboratories belonging to the Japanese Army and Navy arsenals, in order to keep them intact for reparations to the invaded countries. According to MacArthur, Japan had allowed equipment worth tens of millions of dollars to deteriorate and had also dismantled machinery within the factories. Therefore, he instructed the Japanese government not to dismantle them further and dispatched troops in four regiments to guard them, in order to maintain their integrity. The aircraft factories and aircraft parts factories affected by this directive totaled 265. Reparations Commissioner Pauley had listed them as first-priority materials, ready to be transferred to other countries. Among them, 47 belonged to the Nakajima Aircraft Company, 19 each belonged to the Mitsubishi and Aichi companies, 15 belonged to the Kawasaki Company, and 9 belonged to the Hitachi Company. The naval arsenals of the former major naval bases of Yokosuka, Yokohama, Sasebo, and Kure, and the arsenals of Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka, and Kokura, were also ordered to be maintained by the Supreme Commander.

### US Military Authorities Order Dissolution of Unofficial Korean Military Groups, Including Boy Scouts

At the same time, military authorities continued to investigate the disturbances between the left and right factions of the previous two days.

[United Press, Seoul, 20th] The US occupation authorities ordered the start of an investigation into the conflict between the left and right factions of Koreans, which occurred on the morning of the 19th of this month when 200 members of the Korean Student League marched to protest the UN trusteeship of Korea, clashing with police near the headquarters of Lieutenant General Hodge, commander of the US occupation forces. Police fired over 100 shots, arresting 119 people and dispersing the demonstrators, killing two people and injuring many others.

### Soviet Union Bans Religious Freedom; Pope Issues Exhortation of Reprimand

[Report from this newspaper] According to a San Francisco broadcast on the 20th: Pope Pius XII issued an encyclical yesterday to commemorate the 350th anniversary of the return of the Ruthenian Church to Rome, pointing out and reprimanding the current situation of the Ruthenian Church and the Soviet Union's ban on the spread of Catholicism. In this papal encyclical, the Pope continued to ask all members of the United Nations to earnestly implement the promise of religious freedom and denounced the Soviet Union's severe prohibition of the spread of Catholicism in Ruthenia and eastern Ukraine as illegal. Ruthenia was originally the easternmost part of Czechoslovakia and has now been incorporated into the Soviet Union. Its people are all Catholic believers who worship the Roman Pope. Since its annexation by the Soviet Union, its people have suffered all kinds of oppression from the Soviet Union, forcibly abandoning their long-held religion.

### Unrest Continues in Jerusalem

One of the dead was a British officer, and the other was an armed Jew. The injured was a British police officer. The power substation was only slightly damaged because the military police acted quickly, so the entire substation and nearby radio station were preserved. An investigation in the Jewish quarter this morning found many firearms, bombs, explosives, ammunition, and other weapons.

### US Scientists Invent New Drug to Treat Malaria; More Effective Than Quinine

[United Press, Washington, 20th] US scientists report that a new synthetic drug has been invented to treat malaria, which is more effective than Atabrine or quinine. The drug is called SN7618. According to the Malaria Research Cooperative Committee, its onset of action is three times faster than the above two drugs when used to treat acute malaria, and it does not need to be taken daily, but can be taken weekly to alleviate the disease. This drug does not stain the skin like Atabrine, nor does it easily cause tinnitus like quinine, and it does not cause nausea, which the other two drugs may cause. At the same time, another new drug was announced in science, which has the hope of curing relapsing malaria, which is common among returning soldiers. However, neither new drug is available to the public, and the latter is still in the early stages of experimentation, so there is no specific name. At least 300 million people worldwide suffer from malaria each year. The United States spent $5 million on research during the war, testing 14,000 compounds in order to invent a cure. Prisoners and those awaiting rebuttal mostly volunteered to contract the disease for treatment for experimental purposes. Hundreds of thousands of seabirds, chickens, ducks, monkeys, dogs, mice, and rabbits were used in the laboratory. The first new drug has been used to treat 5,000 malaria patients, including more than 1,000 soldiers, with considerable success, but it cannot be made available to the general public until further testing. The drug is named SN7618 because it was successful after 7,618 trials in a four-year research program. Its method of preparation is to combine a part of an Atabrine molecule with another chemical. According to scientists, there are six other new drugs in the same chemical family that appear to be superior to Atabrine, but it is not yet known whether they are superior to SN7618.

### Sudden Announcement of Withdrawal from French Political Circles; Where Will De Gaulle Go?

— Special Article from This Newspaper's Information Office

Just when all the people of France and the people of the United Nations were watching General Charles de Gaulle, the chairman of the French government, a shocking piece of news came out that he had resolutely resigned!

There are many reasons for his resignation this time. This newspaper has already analyzed this and published it on the second page. It does not seem necessary to repeat it here. The purpose of this article is only to look back on his past and look forward to his future. But we first believe that since the French armistice with Germany in June 1940, General de Gaulle has tirelessly traveled to London, North Africa, and Paris to lead Free France and fight.

### French People Expect De Gaulle to Work for the Motherland

What General de Gaulle has accomplished in the past cannot be considered anything, and now he has things he needs to do, and at the same time France has infinitely important work waiting for De Gaulle to do. He will be the only leader best suited to taking on the task of rebuilding France, so people are waiting for him to use his immense power to rebuild France. This unanimous national and even global confidence in him for the reconstruction work requires courage, intelligence, and faith, and General de Gaulle is recognized to possess these excellent qualities and qualifications. His qualifications in France can be described in one sentence: General de Gaulle is a rare genius in the entire chronicle of France, an organizer who recombines the dispersed popular spirit and popular strength of France. He is the strong mainstay of democratic and free France.

President de Gaulle suddenly resigned this time. Will this cause the French train to derail? This is the only basis for the world's alarm.

### France's First Head of State: From Humble Beginnings

General de Gaulle is the first head of state of France in five years to be elected by the people. The suffering and tribulations he has endured are difficult to fully describe, and his experiences in the last half-year alone have been beyond the endurance of ordinary people. It wouldn't be wrong to say he lacked patience, but he has, after all, persevered and fought through it all. His resignation is not as simple or passive as some news reports suggest, stating that he is exiting the political stage; it is highly possible that it has the potential for taking a step back and then advancing two steps forward.

The General's name is Charles; besides the "given name" Charles, he also has three other names: André, Joseph, and Marie. He was born in Lille, France, on November 2, 1890, making him 56 years old this year.

In his childhood, he stood out for his love of work and diligent studies. He later entered the Saint-Cyr Military Academy, rising from the ranks of a common soldier and eventually displaying his extraordinary talent.

On August 2, 1914, General de Gaulle was assigned to the 1st Battalion of the 33rd Infantry Regiment, at which time he held the rank of lieutenant. In this initial battle, he displayed the utmost courage. Even after being wounded, he returned to the front lines as soon as he recovered. The Second Division, seeing his bravery and skill in battle, awarded him with the following words: "De Gaulle has repeatedly reconnoitered enemy positions under dangerous conditions and obtained much valuable information." This shows the high regard in which he was held by his superiors. Subsequently, he also participated in the famous Battle of Verdun during World War I, achieving meritorious service.

### A Shell Arriving on the Front Lines: Waiting for it to Explode

At this time, let us cite another example to illustrate de Gaulle's character. One day, while he and two comrades were on a reconnaissance mission, a shell was launched by a grenade launcher. They all clearly saw the shell flying above them. The two lieutenants lay down, but he stood waiting for it to explode. After the smoke cleared, he said to them simply, "A little startled, gentlemen?" This story illustrates his spirit of courage, composure, sincerity, and friendship. As for his contributions in the war against Germany, they are widely praised.

Since 1940, France's domestic affairs, diplomacy, and military affairs have faced unprecedentedly severe crises. After a brief period of chaos and significant damage, the French national liberation movement, under the leadership of General de Gaulle, greatly expanded, showing signs of revival and strength in unity everywhere.

### French Assembly Debates Become Increasingly Intense

Over the past six months, President de Gaulle has endured debates in the French Assembly, which have become increasingly heated. Weeks ago, due to the issue of national defense spending, de Gaulle once threatened to resign. At that time, the Socialist Party and the Communist Party both said that France was spending too much on the military and insisted on cuts. An agreement was reached by New Year's Day: If the government did not submit a proposal for the reorganization of the army before February 15, the 20% cut in expenses they demanded would automatically take effect on February 20. Regarding the food problem, the government's policies were also severely criticized by all parties in the Assembly. In terms of government, the Communist Party held 147 seats, making it the largest party in the Assembly; the Socialist Party held 138 seats; the Progressive Catholic Party held 135 seats; the Radical Socialist Party held 26 seats; and the Moderate Party and various right-wing parties held a total of 76 seats. De Gaulle's government, based on these three major parties, advocated that not only should the cabinet bear collective responsibility, but also that each minister should receive the support of all parties. However, things did not go as planned, and de Gaulle ultimately resigned in this environment.

### Dressed in New Governmental Attire: Returning to the Stage

In fact, General de Gaulle, as President of the Provisional Government, had gained the trust and support of the national electorate. As long as the French people and political parties, under de Gaulle's leadership, further strengthen their unity and increase their courage, and under the conditions that all internal wars have disappeared and social unrest is being avoided as much as possible, the days of France's economic recovery will be in sight. However, regrettably, the three major political parties in France achieved victory in the general election, but failed after taking office. De Gaulle's resignation has little to do with his personal gains or losses, but has a huge relationship with the French people. General de Gaulle knows this very well and will not disappoint the people of his country. Although his determination to resign is irreversible, he may still have a chance to make a comeback in the short term. General de Gaulle will appear dressed in another new government attire, leaving us no room for panic or disappointment.

Fourth, there is often a misunderstanding in the outside world regarding the method of exercising the five powers stipulated in the draft constitution. Many people mistakenly believe that the five-yuan system of the National Government over the past ten years is the future five-yuan system.

The Five-Yuan System

The current five-yuan system is the five-yuan system of the period of political tutelage. The legislative principles of the Legislative Yuan are determined by the Central Committee of the Kuomintang, which then passes them to the Legislative Yuan to formulate laws. The current Legislative Yuan does not have the power to initiate laws. All proposals must also be approved by the Central Committee before the legislative process can be completed. The same is true for the Executive Yuan; its important policies must be approved by the Central Committee. Except for the Judicial Yuan, which is independent and the Central Committee does not interfere with judgments, the important affairs of all other Yuans must be approved by the Central Committee. Therefore, the current government is a one-power system. The five Yuans after the National Assembly will be very different from the current situation, and the powers of each Yuan will be more substantial than they are now. The future Legislative Yuan will be the highest legislative body. Except for laws initiated by the National Assembly, the Legislative Yuan can initiate any bill. Such a Legislative Yuan is virtually no different from the parliaments of Britain and the United States.

Presidential Powers

Fifth, regarding the concrete problems of the country, the president stipulated in the current draft constitution has two qualifications: one is the head of state, representing the Republic of China externally; the other is the chief executive, and the president of the Executive Yuan and the heads of various ministries will be responsible to the president in the future. The president has the power to directly command the administration. The ministers in the United States are responsible to the president, not to the parliament or the voters. The current draft constitution stipulates that the president is responsible to the National Assembly, which is equivalent to a presidential system. Some people criticize the draft constitution for granting the president too much power, but if we look at the regulations of the president in the draft constitution, the president's powers are exercised "according to law." The president only has the power to exercise the powers granted to him by law. The most vehemently opposed provision is Article 44 of the draft constitution, which stipulates the president's power to issue emergency decrees. In fact, the president must obtain the resolution of the Executive Yuan and submit it to the Legislative Yuan for ratification before issuing emergency decrees. As for the so-called excessive presidential power, this point may be studied, and other presidential powers are limited.

Local System

Sixth, the draft constitution did not have good provisions for the provincial system at that time. In recent years, we have also felt that the provincial-level provisions need to be supplemented. When the draft constitution was being drafted, the central government was focusing on centralization, gradually concentrating the powers of the local governments. The draft constitution did not stipulate that provinces have any public powers. The central government tells them what to do, and they do it. The financial power has also been centralized in the central government, and the budget has become a part of the central government's budget. This was justified during the War of Resistance Against Japan and achieved considerable results, enabling the central government to bear the financial burden during the war. In the future, during peaceful national construction, we feel that this should be corrected. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings also clearly stipulate that the provincial governor should be elected by the people, but the draft constitution does not have this provision. Last year, the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association studied the results, and everyone felt that this system should be changed. The status of the province should be redefined. On the one hand, it represents the state in the implementation of state laws, and on the other hand, the province is also a local autonomous body with its own affairs, restoring the ideal balance of power between the state and local governments. In addition, there are two points:

(1) The draft constitution does not mention military affairs or finance. Mr. Zhou Enlai said that the electoral system should also have principled provisions in the constitution. When the Legislative Yuan drafted it, there were special chapters on military affairs and finance. During the review, it was believed that this was a policy issue and should be changed according to the situation. If the constitution rigidly stipulates changes in the military service and national defense system, the constitution must be amended. Therefore, it was not included.

People's Freedom

(2) General scholars of the constitution say that the people's rights and obligations and the freedoms of the people stipulated in this reality have a sentence of "shall not be restricted except in accordance with the law." It is argued that these words should be removed. The freedoms stipulated are unconditionally guaranteed in peacetime. If there is a war against a foreign country, is the freedom of the people limited? Britain is the most liberal country, but in 1940, when France was about to collapse, Churchill organized a coalition government and proposed to Congress to authorize the requisition of manpower and materials. Capitalist countries attach great importance to the protection of property, but in wartime, they cannot but temporarily give it up. Many countries' constitutions unconditionally guarantee it, but when martial law is imposed, some articles of the constitution can be temporarily suspended. Since all countries have this precedent, will China adopt the method of suspending certain articles of the constitution by presidential decree when the constitution is implemented? We believe that the constitution is the fundamental law, and suspending certain articles of the constitution shakes the people's confidence in the dignity of the constitution. How can we avoid suspending the effectiveness of the articles and give the government the power to deal with the needs of the facts? The government must have a legal basis. The so-called law has two forms: one is formulated by the National Assembly, and the other is formulated by the Legislative Yuan, which is responsible to the National Assembly.

In short, the Five-Five Constitution may still have many doubts and shortcomings. The Kuomintang does not think that this draft is immutable and cannot be modified. What it hopes is that the Constitution of the Republic of China will be based on the highest principles of the Three People's Principles and implement the five-power system, on the one hand, to protect the people's exercise of political power, and on the other hand, to enable the government to execute state affairs. As for the generation, organization of the National Assembly, the powers of the President, the organization and operation of the five Yuans, those are technical issues that can be discussed, supplemented, and revised in the long term.

### French Democrat, General de Gaulle

The results of the French general election proved the people's support for General de Gaulle and the policies of the Provisional Government. Undoubtedly, people have recognized him as the representative of public opinion. This general election can be regarded as a vote of confidence by French citizens in General de Gaulle, as well as an approval of the Provisional Government's national policies.

General de Gaulle gave women the right to participate in politics and allowed the public to decide the future organization of France, which has proven that he fully believes in democracy. When the work of the Constituent Assembly is completed and the Fourth Republic is formally proclaimed, French politics will take a step further, which will be closely related to the name of General de Gaulle.

All of this shows that General de Gaulle has proven himself to be a French democrat. (Temporary)

### A Commoner's Fair Words

— Xu Muda

Dear Editor: I am now submitting an article, hoping your newspaper will publish it. I must ask you to pay attention to two things: (1) I have no connection with the Kuomintang or the government; I am purely objective in my research. (2) I wrote this article for no personal gain. I just feel that the will of us ordinary people is being oppressed by those clamorous and selfish individuals more than ever before! Every day I read the specious arguments in the Political Consultative Conference, and my blood boils! I don't know if

you, sir, can give me a chance to express my free opinions? Xu Muda, January 20th

(Reader's Opinion) The reasons why the existing National Assembly representatives should not be dismissed have been clearly explained by Mr. Sun Zhesheng, Mr. Chen Lifu, and others recently. However, their explanations are still mainly focused on legal principles, and because they stand in the position of the government and Kuomintang members, their statements are very moderate and reserved. I now stand on the position of a commoner, neither government nor Kuomintang, and from a factual point of view, I will thoroughly discuss the reasons why the National Assembly representatives should not be re-elected.

Those who advocate for re-election, whether in the Political Consultative Conference or outside, generally hold no more than four reasons:

Their first reason, perhaps the biggest one, is that the existing National Assembly representatives were elected in 1936 and 1937, and more than eight years have passed since their election, which is too long. This argument seems to be based on legal principles, and many people may find it very convincing. Mr. Sun and Mr. Zhang have already explained that these representatives are representatives for constitution-making, not for constitutional governance; they have a task but no term of office, so the government has no reason to remove their legal status. This is also a response from a legal perspective. Let's think about it from a factual perspective: Indeed, the National Assembly representatives should have been elected and then immediately carried out the task of constitution-making; they should not have delayed its execution for eight years. But why did they not carry out the task? Obviously, because China was invaded by Japan on a large scale shortly after the representatives were elected, the National Assembly scheduled to be convened in November 1937 could not be convened for eight years. So, the representatives' failure to perform their duties was not due to their own fault, but to the Japanese invasion. The greatest purpose of the Japanese invasion was originally to destroy our nation-building, so the national policy set by the National Government to carry out resistance and nation-building at the same time was to ensure that the Japanese purpose of destroying our nation-building could not be fully achieved, at least. With the victory of the War of Resistance, the National Government immediately decided to convene the National Assembly on May 5th of this year to formulate a constitution and implement constitutional government, which is to complete nation-building as soon as possible and start the restoration as soon as possible, so as to prove that the greatest purpose of the Japanese invasion has completely failed. Therefore, all those who are willing for our nation to complete the great cause of nation-building as soon as possible, and all those who are willing for the purpose of the Japanese invasion to completely fail, should actively support the National Assembly to convene quickly, and must not passively obstruct the convening of the National Assembly. If one says they want constitutional government, and at the same time uses the excuse that the National Assembly representatives were elected too long ago to obstruct the convening of the National Assembly, that is to delay the implementation of constitutional government even longer, which is to start our nation-building work even later, which is definitely not the will of our people, but rather to carry out the will of the Japanese invaders at the beginning of their invasion! Because re-electing the National Assembly representatives will take at least six months to a year, then we will not be able to see the promulgation of a constitution after May of this year. Isn't this deliberately making fun of China's constitutional government, and letting the people have a few more days of respite under "multi-party chaotic politics"?

The second reason for advocating re-election is that more than eight years have passed since the representatives were elected, and many factual changes in the meantime have made these representatives insufficient to represent the people. The factual changes they refer to are roughly of four kinds: (1) Many new political parties and factions have emerged in the country; (2) Some representatives have died or defected to the enemy; (3) Many meritorious people during the War of Resistance are not representatives; (4) Many young people have reached the age of voting, and they are not representatives. These many factual reasons, in fact, are none of them valid. As far as new political parties and factions are concerned, the government already has a way to take the facts into account, and is prepared to increase the number of representatives as a remedy, which can be considered quite thoughtful. Even without this method, why should the established election be overturned just because there are new parties and factions? Should the parties of a minority of people dominate the national election, and the election conducted by the legally ruling National Government be invalid? Furthermore, as for the representatives who have died or defected to the enemy, this will naturally not become a problem, because if a small number of people have lost their qualifications as representatives, we naturally have to find ways to replenish them, and no one can say that most of the representatives have died or defected to the enemy. As for whether those who have made meritorious contributions during the War of Resistance are representatives, this cannot become a reason either. The original purpose of electing representatives was to formulate a constitution, not to commend military achievements. Moreover, who are the meritorious contributors to the War of Resistance? The first, of course, are the soldiers who have been loyal and devoted to the cause. However, these sensible soldiers are the most law-abiding in China. They have done the most for the country, but they are the most retiring when it comes to politics. General Fu Zuoyi is a representative! Do these people who shout for democracy intend to incite "military domination" and use soldiers to make the constitution? Apart from soldiers, can those parliamentarian-style literati politicians who have been arguing endlessly in the rear for eight years, and are still arguing there today, also brazenly consider themselves to have made meritorious contributions in the War of Resistance? As for the growth of young people, that is also not a problem. Because after the National Assembly passes the constitution, according to the government's planned method, it will begin the election of the second National Assembly representatives, which is a good opportunity for young people to be elected. And we cannot say that just because there are newly grown young people, the old elected representatives should be overturned. All in all, all those who advocate re-election based on factual changes do not have sufficient reasons to prove that all representatives should be deemed invalid.

The third reason for advocating re-election is that the original election was not well conducted. Then we must ask, what does "not well" refer to? If it is said that the original election violated the law, then to overturn the election, factual evidence must be presented and legal action taken. If "not well" simply means that the original election was not perfect, then what can be considered perfect? Frankly speaking, we are originally a country without a foundation of civil rights. Even our most recent elections in the future may not be perfect. In fact, even countries with advanced civil rights cannot say that their elections are perfect. However, the election completed over more than a year in 1936 and 1937 did not have any major flaws or abuses, and is by no means comparable to elections in the warlord era. If someone casually uses the word "not well" to overturn this legal and established election, then that is trying to use an action without legal basis to overturn a fact with legal basis, and using the claims of a minority to overturn the will of the majority. There is nothing more undemocratic than this! Moreover, if we say that the original election was not well conducted, then can we have a better election now? We have experienced eight years of the War of Resistance, and most of the country has either suffered from war, been occupied, been divided by parties, or been ravaged by bandits. Therefore, today, people are either living in poverty, order is chaotic, or the people have lost their free will. These are all conditions unfavorable to elections. Let us put aside all legal issues and ask, can we deny these various conditions unfavorable to elections? If we cannot deny them, and yet insist on advocating for re-election and stubbornly pointing out that the previous election was not good, is this deliberately making trouble?

The fourth reason for advocating re-election is that the Kuomintang has too much dominance among the existing representatives. Many people have not said this reason, but in fact, it is a very important reason in their minds. If only the government's method of increasing the number of representatives is followed, the opposition fears that the Kuomintang's advantage can still be maintained, which is the real reason why they insist on re-election. I am neither a member of the Kuomintang, nor do I have any actual relationship with the Kuomintang or the government. I am just a commoner with few opportunities to speak. However, I think about it calmly: If the Kuomintang can gain an advantage in the National Assembly, what is not good for the country? I have two reasons to hope that the Kuomintang will have an advantage: (1) I believe that only the Kuomintang can sincerely uphold the Three People's Principles and the Five-Power Constitution. The task of this National Assembly is to formulate a constitution, and this task is extremely important to the future of the Republic of China. If the Kuomintang has an advantage in the assembly, then the future constitution will definitely conform to the Three People's Principles and the Five-Power Constitution. The draft constitution promulgated by the National Government, I believe, at least does not violate the Three People's Principles and the Five-Power Constitution. As for other parties, no matter how they say that the Kuomintang does not implement the Three People's Principles, I absolutely do not believe that these parties can truly abide by the Three People's Principles. If they abide by the Three People's Principles, they would naturally have joined the Kuomintang long ago, instead of following other principles and organizing other parties. Verbally, they also say that they do not oppose the Three People's Principles, or even that they are willing to fight for the Three People's Principles. In fact, they oppose the National Government's draft constitution, which means opposing the Father of the Nation, Mr. Sun Yat-sen's, Principles of Democracy and the Five-Power Constitution. This is undeniable. Since I am in favor of the Three People's Principles and the Five-Power Constitution, I naturally support the Kuomintang's majority. I cannot believe that we can create a better constitution without the Three People's Principles and the Five-Power Constitution. Therefore, I believe that whether the Kuomintang has a majority or not is greatly related to China's future. (2) Another reason why I support the Kuomintang is because the Kuomintang has a history of governing for twenty years. Moving from political tutelage to constitutional government does not necessarily mean that the country's politics must be taken from the Kuomintang and handed over to other parties or factions. In the constitutional period, the people must decide for themselves which party to elect. Just in terms of formulating a constitution, in addition to basing it on the principles of the Three People's Principles and the Five-Power Constitution, it must also be based on the experience of actually bearing the responsibility of politics. Weren't the major tasks of founding the Republic of China, overthrowing the warlords, laying the foundation for unification, and leading the War of Resistance all led by the Kuomintang? I cannot imagine that when it comes to formulating a constitution and implementing constitutional government to complete the great cause of revolutionary nation-building, the responsibility must be handed over to some parties with relatively lacking political experience, and even more so, I cannot imagine that the people must hand it over to some parties accustomed to making trouble. Those who oppose the Kuomintang can list many of the Kuomintang's faults, but those who oppose it probably don't even have the Kuomintang's ability! If they do, they are not young either, so why haven't they contributed to the country like the Kuomintang before? The Political Consultative Conference has held seven or eight meetings, and has completely exposed the emptiness and incompetence of those so-called parties! If the responsibility of formulating a constitution, such a major responsibility, is completely handed over to these people, the result would be truly terrible.

Based on the above criticisms, we know that we should not only passively oppose the proposal to re-elect the National Assembly representatives, but also actively support the first National Assembly to convene as scheduled. There are three benefits to convening as scheduled: (1) Constitutional government will be implemented sooner, politics will be stabilized sooner, and the start of restoration and construction will begin sooner. (2) Legal elections can be maintained and not overturned, which can increase the country's attention to elections and improve the country's concept of complying with laws and regulations. (3) Reduce the opportunity for disputes among parties and factions, so that the constitution deliberated and agreed upon according to the essence of the Three People's Principles and the Five-Power Constitution can be established as the fundamental law on which the permanent survival of the Republic of China depends.

There are also many self-proclaimed fair and impartial people who hold a appeasing attitude, thinking that it would not hurt to re-elect to quell party disputes. This so-called fair and impartial attitude is the hypocritical and peacemaking attitude, which is the most undesirable. If there is a reason to re-elect, then re-elect. If there is no reason, then absolutely do not re-elect. Election is such an important matter, and the will of the majority must never be forced to yield to the clamor of a minority! So this article is also standing on the position of the majority of voters, the position of ordinary people, protesting against those minorities who threaten the people with clamor. I firmly believe that the ability to extend the people's will is the main condition for the success of our constitutional government.

Editorial

### The National Assembly Should be Convened as Scheduled

Since the convening of the Political Consultative Conference, it has generally been able to proceed in a harmonious atmosphere. Although no agreement has yet been reached on several important issues at hand, the fact that the meeting can always unfold in an atmosphere of coordination is enough to comfort the people's eager expectations. In previous meetings, according to reports, the discussions on the National Assembly and the draft constitution have been the most heated; and it is said that the distance between the opinions of the various parties is also relatively large. Regardless of the opinions of the various parties on these two issues, the heated discussions on these two issues are sufficient to show the attention of the various parties to these issues. In terms of nature, the National Assembly represents all the people and formulates the constitution for the long-term plan of China; the draft constitution is our fundamental law of the country, which is extremely important in relation to civil rights and the political system of the country. It is also comforting that the various parties have made heated discussions on these two issues. However, regarding these two issues, although the gentlemen of the Political Consultative Conference have each explained their positions and elaborated their high opinions, these two issues are of great importance to the interests of the Chinese people's future, and we, standing in the position of reporters, should also comment on the position of the people.

The issue of the National Assembly is actually a non-issue. The Chinese Kuomintang completed the unification of China through revolution, and after a period of political tutelage, it finally decided to return power to the people and implement constitutional governance. In May 1936, it promulgated the National Assembly Representative Election Law, and immediately put it into practice. Unexpectedly, the Lugouqiao Incident occurred the following year, triggering a full-scale war of resistance. The convening of the National Assembly was thus postponed due to this irresistible reason. Now that the War of Resistance has ended, the government has decided to convene the National Assembly on May 5 of this year. Once this National Assembly is convened and a constitution is formulated, constitutional governance can be implemented. Everyone is looking forward to democratic politics, so there should be no problem with this. Now, various parties have objections to this. To summarize their reasons, there are roughly several points: (1) Some of the National Assembly representatives were not elected by the people, but were appointed by the government; (2) The number of Kuomintang representatives attending ex officio is too large; (3) The representatives elected ten years ago may not be able to represent today's public opinion, etc. In addition, there are also some people who advocate for the nature of the National Assembly to not only make the constitution, but also execute it. If we make a thorough study of these issues, we will find that these debates are meaningless; to examine their intention, they merely want to make a problem that was originally not a problem become complicated, deliberately obstructing the government's realization of returning power to the people, extending the current political system, and opening the door to the division of power by various parties and factions. This is truly not the blessing of our people!

In the discussion on the National Assembly, we must pay attention to one fact, that the National Assembly Representative Election Law promulgated by the government in May 1936, and the representatives produced according to this law, cannot be canceled, and cannot be denied as valid. Although these representatives were produced ten years ago, their failure to fulfill their mission early was not due to the government's delay, or their own abandonment, but due to irresistible foreign aggression and war. Now that the war has ended victoriously, we absolutely cannot deny that they are valid. This is impossible in terms of law, reason, and sentiment. As for the argument that there are too many Kuomintang representatives ex officio, we cannot deny one fact that, up to now, China is under the rule of the Kuomintang, unified under the leadership of the Chinese Kuomintang, and won the victory of the War of Resistance, and the convening of the National Assembly is also organized by the government ruling under the Kuomintang, so it is natural for the number of Kuomintang representatives ex officio to be relatively large. Moreover, the percentage of Kuomintang representatives ex officio in the total number of assembly representatives is not too high, and the government intends to expand the number of representatives to include all parties and factions, so this point should not be deeply criticized. Furthermore, regarding the point that some representatives were not elected by the people but were appointed by the government, this was also due to an irresistible situation. For example, some of the representatives appointed by the government probably belonged to the Northeast region. At that time, the Northeast was under the control of the Japanese invaders, and elections were indeed impossible to conduct, so this expedient measure had to be taken. Although the rule of the Japanese invaders in the Northeast has collapsed today, the situation in various places is still unclear. The Northeast representatives appointed by the government came from the Northeast, so it should not be difficult to understand the general intentions of the Northeast people and represent the Northeast people in performing their duties. Therefore, the issue of the representatives of the National Assembly should not be regarded as a problem to be discussed. In addition to this, we have also heard people advocate for submitting the so-called issue of the representatives of the National Assembly to a poll. This sounds like a very beautiful phrase, but its implementation is also problematic. China's territory is so vast, the tools of transportation and communication are so rudimentary, and the people's level of knowledge is so low. How can we measure public opinion? What standard will the poll be based on? All of this seems to be somewhat irresponsible talk. If we talk about polling, we represent the people, at least a part of the people, and say that polling cannot be fully relied upon, especially in today's situation. Therefore, we dare to say that the representatives of the National Assembly should continue to be valid, and should not lose their representativeness due to the passage of time. The Christian Science Monitor, according to Reuters news, published an article on the National Assembly on the 20th of this month, saying: "Some experienced observers agree with the Chinese Communist Party's view that the National Assembly representatives took too long to produce and are not sufficient to represent general political intentions; but they also believe that re-elections at this time will not only cause a long delay in the convening of the National Assembly, but will also affect national unity, which is an extremely impractical thing to implement." This is indeed a very pertinent judgment and provides us with much food for thought.

As for the nature of the National Assembly, that is also a superfluous issue. The National Assembly Organization Law has provisions for this and should not be raised as a problem. Making the constitution and executing the constitution are two different things. Now we do not yet have a constitution, so the National Assembly is needed to formulate it, and when the formulated constitution will be executed is another issue, so the convening of this National Assembly is for making the constitution and not for executing it, which is also very clear in principle. After the National Assembly is convened and a constitution is formulated, the government should immediately implement constitutional governance and then convene the National Assembly regularly according to the constitution to return power to the people. Only in this way can we embark on the road to democratic politics. Today, the gentlemen of the Political Consultative Conference are gathered in the wartime capital, and should not think that they are carrying out reform and innovation, let alone think that they are carrying out a bloodless or preparing for a bloody political revolution, but are publicly and openly consulting on some current political issues within the political system established by the Kuomintang, under the recognized leadership of the Kuomintang and under the highest principle of nation-building by adhering to the Three People's Principles, and seeking further coordination after discussion. The National Assembly should not be a problem. After a long war of resistance, what the Chinese people want is stable order. In the effort to stabilize order, the Chinese people demand the National Assembly to be convened as scheduled, so that constitutional governance can be implemented as soon as possible, and China can truly embark on the road to democratic politics. As for what kind of political system we want after the implementation of constitutional governance, that is another issue.

### Any Transgressions by Chinese or Foreign Military Personnel Should Be Corrected Immediately - Bai Chongxi Reported at the Municipal Government Yesterday

The Shanghai Municipal Government held a memorial week for the Founding Father on the morning of the 21st. More than 400 people attended, including Mayor Qian Dajun and Deputy Mayor He Dequi. After Mayor Qian led the ceremony, he introduced Deputy Chief of Staff Bai Chongxi to give instructions. Bai stated, "During the Northern Expedition in the 16th year of the Republic [1927], I was the first to arrive in Shanghai. At that time, Shanghai still had concessions, and local governance was in the hands of foreigners. All of our armed soldiers were prohibited from entering the concessions. The situation was completely different from today. It is a great pleasure for me to be able to speak here today to the colleagues working under Mayor Qian's leadership. This is my first time in Shanghai since the victory of the War of Resistance. Seeing that the local order is stable and the governance is completely unified, it proves that the Chinese people can do their best to organize and gradually build up this great Eastern city. The future has infinite hope. My mission in Shanghai this time is to inspect the troops. Regarding the issue of military discipline, I believe that the military, police, and constabulary in Shanghai should pay close attention. Any transgressions by Chinese or foreign military personnel should be corrected immediately. Mayor Qian concurrently serves as the Commander-in-Chief of the Songhu Garrison, and he has full authority to handle this. Furthermore, the Army Headquarters has moved to Nanjing and can provide instructions at any time. It is imperative that the military and police cooperate to protect the safety of the people and maintain local order in Shanghai, which is connected to the perceptions of both China and foreign countries." After the speech, the ceremony concluded. Deputy Chief of Staff Bai then met with the directors and heads of various bureaus of the municipal government in the mayor's office and made some inquiries.

### Frozen US Dollar Funds Can Now Be Used

[Reported by this newspaper] According to sources in the American banking community yesterday, there is now hope that the foreign exchange in this city that was previously frozen in the United States can be used. Importers in this city can use the frozen foreign exchange to purchase goods shipped from the United States to China. According to a person in charge of a foreign bank in this city, anyone holding frozen foreign exchange can directly apply to the American bank that issued the draft, and the bank will issue a postal money order to be sent to the payee in the United States. The payee will then submit a request to the US Treasury Department to unfreeze the funds. According to current procedures, after receiving the request, the US government will notify the Chinese Embassy in the United States to seek their opinion. After the Chinese Embassy expresses its agreement, the funds can be unfrozen and used. According to several people in this city who have already applied to unfreeze their funds, although the procedure is very complicated, under normal circumstances, most requests for legitimate commercial funds have been approved.

### Reasons for Overcrowding on Rice Transport Passenger Trains

[Reported by this newspaper] Passenger trains on the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways are still extremely crowded. Travel agencies require passengers to register and be assigned a number the day before purchasing tickets, and purchasing tickets at the station is also not easy. Passengers feel inconvenienced. A reporter visited the Railway Administration and learned that there are three reasons for the overcrowding: (1) Since the victory, the population of this city has been increasing daily. According to unofficial statistics, it has already reached more than 6.5 million people, and the need for transportation has naturally increased. The number of passengers taking the train each day is around 50,000. (2) The number of Hangzhou trains is limited, so it is impossible to increase the number of trains. Passenger cars are also extremely scarce and dilapidated. Each train currently has about 12 cars, and it is impossible to add any more. (3) Recently, prices have been rising sharply, and unlicensed peddlers have become active again. The transportation departments of the two railways are currently trying to convert iron plate freight cars into passenger cars to alleviate the urgent situation. Furthermore, the two railways currently have approximately 20,000 employees. Those who returned to their pre-war positions account for 70%. Since the takeover last year, the salaries of employees have not been officially determined by the Ministry of Transportation, so each person is temporarily paid a living allowance ranging from 7,500 yuan to 22,500 yuan. Ordinary employees, such as ticket inspectors and conductors, mostly receive 12,500 yuan. Although a temporary subsidy has recently been issued, the total monthly amount is still only over 30,000 yuan, and the treatment is relatively meager. It is heard that the authorities have decided to find a way to improve it.

### Second Victory Ship to be Received Soon

The alternate directors are Zhou Xinfang, Li Bolong, and Chen Xihe. The alternate supervisors are Chen Litin, Zheng Junli, and Cui Wanqiu. The first joint meeting of the directors and supervisors was held on the 17th of this month at Kang Le Restaurant. In addition to electing Fei Mu, Yu Wen, Gu Zhongyi, Shi Dongshan, and Yu Ling as standing directors and approving the appointment of Zhang Che as secretary, it was also decided to entrust Gu Yiqiao, Zhao Zhiyou, and Xu Wen to be responsible for resolving the issue of housing funds for the association's headquarters and the actors' guest house. Luo Xuelian, Feng Zi, Ge Yihong, and others formed a special committee to investigate collaborators in the film and drama industry. The association held its first meeting of standing directors on the afternoon of the 19th, at which Yu Wen was appointed as the director of the general affairs department, Shi Dongshan as the director of the organization department, Gu Zhongyi as the director of the academic department, and Fei Mu as the director of the service department. It was decided to hire Zhang Daofan, Pan Gongzhan, and Ma Xulun as honorary directors. Zheng Zhenduo, Ke Zhongping, and D.F. Gledhill as honorary members. Many important motions were resolved during the association's various meetings, such as: (1) To initially raise one million yuan in the shortest possible time to provide accommodation for homeless film and drama personnel coming to Shanghai and to relieve the poor and sick colleagues. (2) To jointly request all theaters and troupes to reduce film donation taxes to 20% and drama donation taxes to 10% in order to promote the development of the drama and film industries. (3) To issue a statement supporting the points made by Chairman Chiang in his opening speech at the Political Consultative Conference and the declaration guaranteeing the people's freedom, hoping to abolish the current system of censorship. Various motions related to the development of the drama and film industries and the research and improvement of drama and film art will be gradually implemented. The emergence of such a unified organization in the city's drama and film circles will surely unite everyone, align their steps, and not only will the film and drama industries achieve significant progress, but the entire cultural movement will also benefit greatly.

### China Industrial and Mining Bank Has Selected a Site for its Shanghai Branch

### High Court Trials Wu Liande, Requests Subpoena for He Junda and Mao Sen

[Reported by this newspaper] Wu Liande, 45, former manager of Liangyou Bookstore Company, a native of Taishan, Guangdong, joined a puppet organization in November 1944 and served as the director of the Hangzhou District of the Puppet Zhejiang Province Incense and Candle Tax Bureau until he left office in July 1945. After the victory, he was arrested by the Songhu Garrison Headquarters and sent to the prosecutor's office. After the facts were verified, a public prosecution was filed with the court. The case was investigated by Court President Liu Yugui in the Special Criminal Court of the High Court yesterday morning. The defendant stated in his defense that after the war, he worked as a manager at the Shanghai branch of Nanyang Bank and became acquainted with Zhang Haoran. In 1945, Zhang contracted the incense and candle tax in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and appointed himself as the "director." He asked me to help. At this time, because the bank had closed and I was persuaded and approved by my friend He Junda, I immediately agreed. He Junda was an intelligence officer in the Southeast Theater and wanted to use me as an outer-circle worker. Furthermore, he sent students to the interior. The incense and candle tax was contracted to merchants, and my role was to help, so it was different from holding a puppet position. After the victory, I visited Mr. Mao Sen, and Mao instructed me to assist in reporting traitors because I was familiar with the inside information of the puppet government. Unexpectedly, on October 19th of last year, I was arrested by the Garrison Headquarters for privately possessing enemy funds and prosecuted for treason. Therefore, I request the court to subpoena He Junda and Mao Sen to provide evidence. The case was adjourned for further questioning. The defendant applied for bail, and the court ordered that a petition be submitted and a decision would be made after deliberation.

### Publishing Industry Hosts Press Conference Against Price Increase in Lead Printing Industry, Affecting Social and Cultural Development

[Our Dispatch] Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the organizing committee of the Shanghai Book Industry Association hosted reporters from various newspapers at Xing Hua Lou Restaurant. Over 80 representatives and reporters from the Shanghai publishing industry attended. Representatives from 62 Shanghai publishing companies, including Commercial Press, Zhengzhong, Zhonghua, Dadong, Kaiming, Shijie, Children's, and Shenghuo, expressed their protest against the 100% price increase by the Lead Printing Industry Association and planned to petition the municipal government to request a halt.

Zhang Yiqu, manager of Eryi Bookstore, and Li Bojia, representative of the Commercial Press, first reported on the unreasonableness of the price increase in the lead printing industry. Zhang Pengzi, manager of the Writer's Bookstore, then vehemently described the impact of the price increase on the cultural sector, stating that the main costs of the lead printing industry had not increased, only the living expenses of workers had increased somewhat. However, in reality, the income of workers was still very limited, and the lead printing industry should not use the pretext of wage increases to raise prices.

Ye Suzhong, manager of Zhengzhong Bookstore, compared the printing situation in Chongqing, stating that the wages for typesetting and printing workers in Chongqing were roughly the same as those here at the end of December. However, other materials and books were more expensive in Shanghai. With the cost of lead printing here rising a hundredfold, the cost of typesetting and printing in Chongqing was half that of Shanghai, which was also unreasonable. The main raw material for printing is ink. Compared with before the war, the price of ink is now 800 times higher than before the war, while paper, the raw material for publishing, is now 8,000 times higher than before the war, yet book prices are only 600 times higher. Now that the prices of various commodities are falling, the printing industry alone is drastically increasing prices. Such a situation will inevitably lead to the closure of publishing houses, which will have a major impact on society and cultural development.

Furthermore, the publishing industry repeatedly suffered devastation during the war. Those who moved to the interior were constantly bombed by enemy planes, with each bombing destroying almost everything. The Battle of Guilin caused even greater losses to the cultural sector. Fortunately, with this victory, they reluctantly returned to work in order to contribute to cultural construction. Now, the printing industry is delivering a fatal blow first. This is tantamount to destroying the revival of Chinese culture. Therefore, we especially appeal to the media to help sanction this.

### Speculators Cautious: Gold Prices Begin to Fall, US Dollars and Hong Kong Dollars Also Decline

Premier Song's arrival in Shanghai and his convening of meetings with the banking sector have made speculators uneasy. Major players repeatedly sold gold to buy stocks. Amid unsubstantiated rumors, small-time investors followed suit, reluctantly closing their positions. Trading was weakest at noon. Fewer spot transactions were made in the after-market. Deliveries for next-day settlement were stable due to purchases from Northern gangs. Morning prices remained steady, but the selling pressure was evident as stock market players sold gold to buy stocks. After opening at 932,000, prices gradually fell to 912,000, then leveled off. However, with Everbright and Maya performing better, the gold market paled in comparison. Holders lost interest and followed the lead of major players. The available supply became even looser, making it difficult to sustain prices. Finally, the 900,000 level was breached, and prices fell below 890,000 by noon. In the afternoon, Northern gangs came to buy for next-day delivery, resulting in minor increases. However, stock market players continued to push up Everbright while selling futures, resulting in steady and mostly sideways movement. In the end, gold fell 37,000 yuan compared to last Saturday, with ornamental gold at 96,000, silver ingots at 750, and silver dollars around 470 yuan. Demand was strong due to year-end holidays, with unofficial interest rates at approximately 10% to 12%.

The US dollar struggled to surpass 1,500 yuan and declined in tandem with gold. It opened at 1,490 yuan, with an arbitrage price of 625 yuan against gold, triggering arbitrage activity. As such, the US dollar did not decline as much as gold. It hovered around 1,450 yuan at noon. Due to hedging activity, the arbitrage price narrowed to 610 yuan per ten taels. The after-market was extremely flat, struggling around 1,455 yuan. In the end, the US dollar fell 33 yuan compared to last Saturday. Old Hong Kong dollars fell 12 yuan due to selling by Guangdong gangs. Small-time holders of new Hong Kong dollars panicked and closed their positions, leading to oversupply and a decline of 5 yuan.

### Everbright Rises Steadily with Support from Stock Market and Northern Gangs: Capital Flows into Stock Market, China Textile Also a Target

Major players in the Chinese stock market returned to push up prices. Capital flowed from the gold market, attracting crowds of investors. Premier Song's arrival in Shanghai caused widespread panic in the gold and commodity markets, leading speculative activity to concentrate in the stock market. Everbright received preferential treatment. Major players in the stock market and Northern gangs deliberately pushed up prices, attracting retail investors and further depleting the available supply. However, due to some selling by Guangdong gangs, prices fluctuated around 1,600 yuan at one point. But the buying pressure seemed relentless, and Everbright ultimately closed at a high price at noon. Maya performed weaker, with high prices proving unsustainable. The Three Small Banks followed closely. Small-cap stocks found it more difficult to keep up. China Textile gradually attracted the attention of strong players, rising sharply from 500+ to around 650 yuan. Rumors circulated that one share would be converted into four shares, with a dividend of 100 yuan. Currently, China Textile, apart from Everbright, generated considerable profits, and its low base price made it extremely attractive. Once buyers launched an attack, capital rushed to buy. At noon, Everbright rose by a staggering 160 yuan compared to last Saturday, Xinyi by 40 yuan, Maya by 120 yuan, and the Three Small Banks by 3 yuan to 6.5 yuan each. Jingfu and Xinguang were close to breakeven. Major players continued to manipulate the market in the afternoon, with transactions in Everbright at 1,780 yuan and Maya at 1,130 yuan, but not widely.

Foreign stocks were subject to rumors, and traders did not publicly post prices. Buyers were extremely excited by the support from Chinese stocks, and the situation was very stable. At noon, popular stocks such as Yisha rose by half to one percent compared to last Saturday, while unpopular and rubber stocks showed little change.

### Bond Market Quiet

The activities of major players in the bond market showed some restraint. Retail investors, wary of high prices, closed their positions and flocked to the stock market. Oversupply pushed prices below 1,600 yuan, retreating to 1,570 yuan. Later, customer gangs took advantage of the low prices to absorb inventory and briefly pushed prices to 1,710 yuan. However, miscellaneous bonds were extremely quiet, and under pressure, prices retreated to 1,580 yuan at noon. Prices hovered around 1,630 yuan at the noon close. Compared to last Saturday, Category A and B bonds fell by 150 yuan, Category C by 90 yuan, Category D by 160 yuan, and Category E by 150 yuan.

### Silk Trend Moderates: Rayon Weaving Orders Plunge by 100,000

With the Lunar New Year approaching, credit gradually tightened. The market for rayon yesterday saw more selling than buying, and appeared to be moderating. The 120 Bridge opened at 1,350,000 yuan, falling to 1,300,000 yuan at closing. In the afternoon, prices rose slightly, quoted at 1,320,000 yuan, but transactions were rare. Sporadic transactions were inevitable for speculation. Yesterday, the market fell by 100,000 yuan, opening at 1,030,000 yuan, trading at 1,000,000 yuan mid-session. In the afternoon, someone sold at 930,000 yuan, but there were no buyers. Although inventory was limited, purchasers continued to come, and prices were relatively firm. Silk goods were mostly sluggish. Maya blankets were 750,000 yuan per hundred, Dachen crepe was 2,350 yuan per yard, and Minsheng brocade remained at last Saturday's original level, priced at 11,000 yuan per piece.

### Yarn Market Sees Heavy Selling Pressure, Cotton Transactions Mediocre

The yarn market continued to weaken yesterday. From opening to closing, it was entirely dominated by selling pressure. This was because the selling price of the Textile Construction Company was reduced by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, while customer sales stagnated, causing prices to decline sharply. Prices for all counts fell by approximately 30,000 yuan. Market sentiment was weak, and the trend lacked vitality.

In the spot cotton market, due to scarce arrivals, factories and cotton dealers inquired slightly. Transactions included Da Feng American fine lint cotton at 80,000 yuan, chicken-foot cotton at 62,000 yuan, Tongzhou cotton at 68,000 yuan, Yuyao cotton at 50,000 yuan, fire-machine cotton at 80,000 yuan, and Nanlu Taihui at 80,000 yuan (all prices are per 100 jin on the Sima scale).

### Small Lump Coal Sells Well

Wholesale transactions in the coal market were quiet, while retail transactions were extremely brisk. Prices remained relatively stable. Among white coal, small lump coal sold more actively. White coal screened lumps and coal fines remained stable. Bituminous coal lumps continued to sell well, but the actual amount of goods flowing out was quite small. The market situation was very hot. Boatloads of firewood and charcoal continued to arrive. Recently, the number of retail vendors has increased, all adhering to the principle of small profits and quick sales. With the Lunar New Year approaching, household demand was strong, and sales were brisk.

### Grain Prices Continue to Rise

Both Japonica and Indica Surpass the 10,000 Yuan Level

Rice prices in producing areas rose steadily, with stores selling out. Prices rose again. White Japonica rose by 300 to 400 yuan, customer Indica rose by 400 to 500 yuan, and glutinous rice also rose by 200 to 300 yuan. Flour from Nanyang moved slightly, while inquiries were made for flour from Beiyang. Prices on this street moved but were not strong, rising by another 100+ yuan. The oil market fluctuated. Soybean oil was scarce, rising by over 1,000 yuan. Raw oil rose slightly by 200 to 300 yuan. Soybeans were stable, falling slightly by 100 to 200 yuan. Sesame was similar. Raw kernels were weak downstream. Soybean cakes were mediocre. Wine sales remained brisk, rising by another 500 yuan.

### Timber Firm

The timber market remained firm and strong. Due to the general price increases across the market, sellers followed suit. Prices of all goods rose on average. It was reported that Hangzhou timber was being shipped in by land. Currently, each tael was still selling for 47,000 yuan. Furthermore, small plywood factories in this city now have small poplar plywood for sale, selling for 75 yuan per square foot.

### Tea Exports Flourish Domestically

Although international trade in black edged tea remains suspended, since the trade routes were opened, domestic sales in Tianjin, Guangdong, Qingdao, and Jiangbei have been brisk. Prices have also become increasingly firm due to buying and selling. Green tea in particular has been selling smoothly, leading to a resurgence of profits. The current situation is very solid, and the market outlook is promising.

### Customer Gangs Acquire Cotton Cloth

The cloth market is stable. Sporadic transactions continue to occur. Sichuan, Hankou, and Changsha gangs are still buying light-colored goods, blue cloth, shirt poplin, and dye stuffs on dips. Fujian gangs frequently stockpile low-end goods of the local factory line. Products from the Tianjin factory in this city are favored, leading to slightly higher prices. Low-end men's line is also in this category.

### Trade with Taiwan Opens, Except for Tobacco, Alcohol, Matches, Rice, and Sugar. White Printing Paper Awaits Shipment.

[Our Dispatch] Yesterday, according to the person in charge of the Taiwan Provincial Administrative Governor's Office in Shanghai, Taiwan Province has decided that, effective immediately, in order to promote the exchange of goods with the mainland, all goods are permitted to be freely imported, except for tobacco, alcohol, and matches, which are monopolies, and all goods are permitted to be freely exported, except for rice and sugar. Furthermore, Chairman Chen of the province was ordered by Premier Song of the Executive Yuan to ship 1,000 tons of white printing paper to Shanghai. It is reported that preparations have been completed and the shipment will be ready to go as soon as a ship is available.

### Forced Conversion of Legal Tender Deposits to Puppet Currency to Be Reversed to Original Legal Tender Rate: Order from the Financial Special Commissioner's Office

Regarding pre-occupation Legal Tender savings deposits and post-occupation Puppet Currency savings deposits in the recovered areas, the Financial Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Finance in the Kyoto-Shanghai area has formulated three measures, as follows: (1) Legal Tender savings deposits received by banks in the recovered areas before the war, which were seized by the enemy and converted into Puppet Currency without any withdrawal by the depositor, should be converted back to Legal Tender at the original exchange rate for calculating principal and interest. (2) Savings deposits received and paid in Puppet Currency from the beginning of the enemy occupation should be converted to Legal Tender at the government's fixed rate for exchanging Puppet Currency. (3) Banks that converted Legal Tender savings deposits to Puppet Currency and continued to accept deposits and withdrawals should follow the procedures in item 1 for deposits converted at the time of the Puppet Currency conversion. It is also reported that the 5 yuan notes of the Peasant Bank printed with the word "Chongqing" and the 10 yuan notes of the Central Bank printed by the Zhonghua Book Company are still in circulation, but attention should be paid to their authenticity.

### National Central Research Institute: Development of Wartime Achievements, Adds Three Institutes: Mathematics, Medicine, Etc., Botany and Zoology Research Separated into Two Institutes

[Our Dispatch from Nanjing] In order to restore operations, the National Central Research Institute has already dispatched Wang Zhongji, Director of the Institute of Zoology, to Nanjing to receive the General Institute in Kyoto, and other staff to receive the institutes in Shanghai. (Before the war, the Institute's Physics, Chemistry, and Engineering institutes were all located in Shanghai. Thereafter, the Institute of Medicine may be moved to Shanghai depending on the situation). Before the war, the Institute had ten research institutes for Physics, Chemistry, Engineering, Astronomy, Meteorology, Geology, History, Languages, Sociology, Psychology, and Animals and Plants. During the War of Resistance to Victory, research developed, expanding the research institute to 14. Now, the original animal and plant research institute is separated into two: animal research and plant research, and three new research units have been added for mathematics research, medicine research and physical anthropology research. Although these three are still in the planning stage, actual research work has already begun. The Institute's Nanjing buildings could not be fully utilized because of artifacts stored by the Cultural Relics Preservation Committee (General Institute in Kyoto located at Chicken Song No. 1), and most of the standard equipment and research supplies remained in the rear. Before the summer vacation, the General Institute in Chongqing may be fully restored in Kyoto. Currently, the President of the Research Institute is still Minister Zhu Liaoguang, and the Director General is Mr. Ben Dongjun.

### Ministry of Education Strictly Banned Enemy and Puppet Textbooks

[Our Dispatch from This City] President Chiang has recently issued a personal edict to the authorities and heads of the provinces and municipalities, stating that the enemy and puppet enslavement education has caused great harm to young people, and that concrete measures must be taken to implement the policy in order to maintain national life. After receiving the edict, the Nanjing Municipal Government took "re-education" as the center, and has clear provisions for teachers and textbooks. The Ministry of Education has learned that the enemy and puppet textbooks were printed in large quantities by the unscrupulous book industry's joint organization, the Pseudo-Chinese United Publishing Company, and had a deep impact. Even recently, in the Kyoto-Shanghai area, shameless people have openly sold and used them, which has had a great impact on education. The Ministry has reiterated its previous orders and sternly ordered all provinces and cities to conduct thorough investigations and bans in order to eradicate them. In addition, the Ministry has also sent another order to the textbook industry to strictly comply with the regulations. The following is the text of the Ministry of Education's instructions to Zhengzhong, Commercial Press, Zhonghua, Shijie, Kaiming, Dadong, Wentong, and other seven companies:

To the Joint Supply Office of National Standard Primary and Secondary School Textbooks, with Seven Companies: It has been found that all primary and secondary school textbooks in all provinces and cities should uniformly use the national standard books, which are supplied by the seven bookstores under the office. For those subjects and volumes for which the national standard books have not yet been published, it is permissible to temporarily select versions edited by the various bookstores in accordance with the current curriculum standards and issued by the Ministry after review or approval. The textbooks compiled and revised by the enemy and puppet regimes in the recovered areas were tools for implementing enslavement education and should be destroyed. The bookstores are not allowed to distribute them, and the schools are not allowed to use them. They have been ordered to comply. It is now reported that bookstores in the recovered areas are still selling pseudo-textbooks, and schools are still using pseudo-textbooks as teaching materials, which is inappropriate. The competent educational administrative authorities in each province and city should conduct strict investigations and bans, and punish bookstores that distribute pseudo-textbooks and schools that use pseudo-textbooks. However, the Office should supervise the seven bookstores under its jurisdiction to fully prepare and supply the national standard textbooks needed by each province and city, so as to prevent shortages. In addition to distributing the books separately, it is urgent to telegraph you to comply with the regulations.

The text of the Ministry's cable to the education bureaus in each province and city is also very stern. Schools in this city have attached great importance to this. It is said that all textbooks printed by the enemy and puppet regimes or that have been submitted to the enemy and puppet regimes for review and deletion will be reported and not allowed to be used.

### Students Studying in the United States Waiting for Ships to Go to the United States in Shanghai

According to news from the education sector in this city, all of the students who won the Anglo-American scholarship last year and went to study in England have already arrived in London and are formally studying, but only 10 of the 41 students who went to study in the United States have arrived due to transportation difficulties. It is reported that one of them has died, and the other 30 have gathered in Shanghai, waiting for ships to go.

### Ginling Women's College of Chengdu to Move Back to Kyoto for Resumption of School in Summer Vacation

Wu Yifang Talks in Kyoto

[Central News Agency, Kyoto, 20th] Dr. Wu Yifang, Chairman of the National Political Council and President of Ginling Women's College, who attended the San Francisco Conference as a representative of China, returned to the country after resting in the United States for many months due to physical discomfort after attending the United Nations Conference in San Francisco last summer. She arrived in Kyoto on the 18th from Shanghai. According to her, the United States is now eager to restore all aspects of operation. Each university is also preparing to solve the problem of accommodating millions of demobilized soldiers. People do not want any more wars, especially in the atomic age, and they feel the importance of world peace and international cooperation. The problem of worker unemployment after the war is not as serious as imagined. Workers engaged in wartime industries have been quickly transferred to the consumer goods industry. Regarding the resumption of Ginling Women's College, Wu said that most of the school buildings in Kyoto have been severely damaged, and the school's instruments, books, and furniture have also been severely damaged, so it will be difficult to restore them to their original state. She will go to Chengdu and Chongqing in the next few days to discuss the matter. The Chengdu campus is expected to close by the end of May, and the campus will be moved to Kyoto in the summer vacation.

### Taiwan Needs Technical Education Talent

[Our Dispatch from This City] The person in charge of the Taiwan Administrative Governor's Office in Shanghai stated that the most needed talent in Taiwan at present are miners and technicians, followed by education. The fourth batch of personnel to Taiwan will be in the areas of administration, education, editing, and publishing. Teachers are paid 80,000 for married and 20,000 for unmarried, and administrative personnel are paid between 50,000 and 150,000. The departure date will be determined soon.

### Wu Yan Yin to Fly to the South Seas Islands

Instructing Overseas Chinese Education

[Our Dispatch from This City] Famous educator Wu Yan Yin recently received instructions from the Ministry of Education, to visit Nanyang as a personal representative of Minister Zhu Jia Hua. There are many Chinese residents in Nanyang. There are quite a few schools that need the instructions and improvement of our educational authorities. Wu came from Manila a few weeks ago.

### The Passing of Master of Chinese Studies, Mr. Zhu Xiangwan

Mr. Zhu Xiangwan of Yixing was a master of Chinese studies of his generation. He served as a professor at various universities, including Datong and Chengming. Throughout his life, he devoted himself to education. He possessed profound attainments in the field of elementary philology, second only to Zhang Taiyan. Unfortunately, he passed away suddenly the day before yesterday. The final encoffining is scheduled for 3:00 PM today at the Shanghai Funeral Home on Route Talas. In accordance with Mr. Zhu's wishes, no obituary will be issued, no gifts will be accepted, and no condolences will be received.

### Brief Reports

Since the start of the school term, the public schools at all levels in Songjiang County have been relying solely on tuition fees for funding. However, the amount collected is very meager, with each teacher receiving only about 500 yuan per month. They are serving the public on an empty stomach, a truly pitiable situation. County Magistrate Huang, upon assuming office, recognized the need for improvement. Therefore, he is comprehensively planning the county's education budget and submitting it to the provincial authorities for approval. However, pending approval, he has specifically implemented temporary advance payment measures to maintain operations: (1) Each teacher and staff member will receive an advance of 5,000 yuan per month, and each school worker will receive an advance of 800 yuan per month. (2) For office expenses, county high schools will receive a monthly advance of 1,500 yuan per grade level, junior high schools will receive a monthly advance of 1,200 yuan per grade level, senior elementary schools will receive a monthly advance of 800 yuan, and junior elementary schools will receive a monthly advance of 500 yuan.

Alumni of National Beiping Normal University from Southeast China have initiated the organization of an alumni association. Yesterday at 3:00 PM, the inaugural meeting was held in the auditorium of the World Society on Lin Sen Middle Road. The turnout of alumni was exceptionally enthusiastic. Former President Li Shizeng delivered a speech, and several important motions were passed. Tao Jue, Xu Zhi, Wang Shikan, Yu Xueyang, Wang Zizhi, Lin Sushan, and Xu Chunhe were elected as seven directors, and Wu Yuan and Zhang Zi were elected as two alternate directors.

With the approval of the school board, the Lixin Accounting College established a specialized night class in the autumn of the 32nd year of the Republic in the Chongqing urban area. The school board has decided to relocate the program to Shanghai this semester and continue its operation. The entrance examination is scheduled for February 10th.

### Second Act of the Basketball League: Blue Team Loses to Giants; Women's Green Team Easily Defeats Qinglian; Green Forest Defeats Zhongyi in Another Match

The inaugural basketball league continued last night with its second act. The audience at the City Sports Hall was quite numerous. The results of the three matches are as follows:

The first match was in the women's division, between the women's champions, the Green Team, and Qinglian. Although the Green Team had lost Yan Weiwen, Wang Yinlan and others due to marriage and departure, they still had ample talent. Qinglian naturally struggled to compete. The score was 19-7 at halftime, and the final result was 37-18, with the Green Team winning decisively.

The second match was in Group A2, between Green Forest and Zhongyi. The latter team consisted of former famous players such as Hu Guocheng and Li Jiazhi, but they had been out of practice for a long time. From the start of the game, Green Forest gradually took the lead. Chen Guozhen scored under the basket, a beautiful sight to behold. The score was 21-12 at halftime, and the final score was 56-26, with Green Forest leading throughout.

The third match was in Group A1, between the Blue Team and the Giants. The Giants had Carson to assist them, but he had also been out of practice for a long time. However, his speed and his commanding presence were still impressive. The score was 15-12 at halftime, with the Giants leading. In the second half, Jin Kun scored first, and the situation became tense. The Blue Team's Jin Changchun and Jin Kun frequently made skillful shots, and they took the lead with a score of 20-15. However, the Giants then surpassed them with a score of 24-23, and the Blue Team ultimately lost a close game with a score of 27-30.

### Morning Friends Cup: Muer Wins Championship in Group B Friends Section

### Introduction to National Oriental Language College

— Guo Weiying

National Oriental Language College was born during the arduous and difficult period of the War of Resistance, in response to the urgent needs of the nation's current situation. Therefore, it bears an exceptionally important mission. This school was originally located in Chenggong, Yunnan, and only moved to Chongqing last summer upon the order of the Ministry of Education. The current temporary location is in Xinkai City, 20 kilometers from Chongqing. The environment is very good, adjacent to Chairman Chiang's official residence and near the cemetery of the late Chairman Lin. It is secluded and quiet, making it a good place for studying. Because it will move east to Nanjing this spring, the facilities are very simple, with only a few thatched huts as school buildings. The school's president has already flown to Nanjing to survey the school site. In order to complete the curriculum and prepare for the move to the east as soon as possible, there will be no winter vacation this year, and the school will return to the capital in mid-April.

The internal organization of the Language College is divided into five departments: Indian, Burmese, Siamese, Vietnamese, and Malay. The curriculum is the same as that taught in general universities, busy and intense. The professors are mostly well-known figures and authoritative scholars in the country, some of whom also hold positions at National Central University, Fudan University, or the Central Political Institute. The students, like those in other schools, come from all over the country. The relationships between the students are very harmonious, and the atmosphere of learning and research is also very strong. Among the two graduating classes, some have gone overseas to engage in overseas Chinese affairs, serving the motherland and the overseas Chinese. In the near future, we will see the footprints of Language College students all over the East.

Life in the Great Rear Area is difficult, and the lack of material conditions is distressing everywhere. There are no textbooks for classes, and students rely mostly on handouts and notes. The library's collection is not very rich. Recently, a large number of books were purchased from India, but it is still not enough. There are no electric lights at night, and five or six people huddle around a dim kerosene lamp to study. The students here are all on public funds, which alleviates the burden on many poor students. They understand the government's painstaking efforts to cultivate young people and are also aware of the great responsibility they bear themselves, so everyone is working hard to study diligently.

The extracurricular activities of the Language College students are also very active. Although they are liberal arts students, they do not neglect physical exercise, so there are often healthy and beautiful people on the sports field. The student self-government association is responsible for the welfare of the students and organizes a cooperative and academic lecture series, among other things. There are also more than a dozen kinds of wall newspapers. There are also several small academic groups, such as the English Learning Association and the Oriental Society, which have made outstanding contributions. They often hold "evening parties" and "symposiums" to help make up for the deficiencies in classroom learning.

We know that many other countries also have Oriental schools that specialize in the study of Oriental affairs. They attach great importance to them, and China, which is located in East Asia, should not ignore them. In order to keep pace with the Oriental universities or colleges in other countries, the Ministry of Education has in principle agreed to consider the issue of upgrading the school to a college after moving to Beijing. So now it is only a matter of time. I believe that the future Oriental Language College will have a bright future. In addition to our own efforts, it also requires the attention and supervision of the broad masses of people throughout the country. (Sent from Chongqing on January 18)

### Chinese Scientists, Organize Yourselves!

— Bao Shixi

News of the Soviet Union's invention of a new type of atomic bomb has been met with skepticism by circles close to the British government. Regardless of whether the Soviet Union has indeed invented a new type of atomic bomb, its painstaking research on this matter is evident. Consider the Soviet Union's past "Five-Year Plans," completed one after another, and the new "Five-Year Plan" that has begun, emphasizing the development of various industrial sectors. Their scientists are all working diligently, truly embodying the spirit of "dedicating themselves heart and soul until their last breath." And the government authorities provide them with spiritual encouragement and material assistance. Their success is not accidental. Looking back at China, what do we see? The state of the scientific community is desolate, and there is much that is unsatisfactory. It's not that we lack scientific talent; the problem is the lack of organization, funding, and encouragement. Individual strength is limited, and the strength of social organizations is also limited. As a result, the scientific community cannot be invigorated, cannot concentrate, and cannot make inventions or contributions. Thus, we lag behind, and we cannot even talk about "atomic energy," let alone the atomic bomb.

"Sleeping Beauty" of East Asia, wake up! "Talented scholars and beautiful ladies" and "romantic affairs" are no longer relevant in today's atomic age. They are becoming the dregs of a progressing world.

If we do not "catch up" and strive for national scientific advancement, research new types of weapons, organize an "atomic" research society, and engage in a scientific struggle for "resurrection," we will inevitably face the threat of survival directly or indirectly, or be eliminated.

We must not rely on others today. The assistance of allied nations should be deeply appreciated, but it is not something we can depend on. (Of course, we must utilize the capital, materials, and talents of others to engage in national reconstruction.) However, we must recognize the proverb "Heaven helps those who help themselves." The best approach is to "return and weave a net" rather than "admiring fish from the edge of the pond." We must "rely on our own efforts," and we must work diligently. But "to do a good job, one must first sharpen one's tools." First, we must have organization, funding, encouragement, a well-equipped scientific research society, and excellent equipment and supplies, in addition to hardworking talent. With these prerequisites, given time, can't China produce new "atomic" inventions?

Today, countries in Europe and America are engaging in large-scale coordination and expansion of scientific research institutions. Can China, a country lagging behind in science, still stand by and watch without urgently seeking to catch up?

Correspondence

### Chongqing Snippets

— Mei Youyun

Since the tenth, Shangqingsi has become a focal point, bustling with activity. Here, the fate of China will be decided at the Political Consultative Conference. All peace-loving people in China and around the world are earnestly and nervously hoping that it can become a memorial site for the generation of peace.

A certain gentleman wrote a jingle describing the life of cultural figures in the rear area over the past eight years:

"Everyone calls me a pedant,
My life is worse than a wet nurse's.
Both take care of children,
Neither starving nor overfed."

This pedant who wants to be "overfed" is somewhat lacking in common sense.

Recently, American films have disappeared from Chongqing's cinemas. Most of what is shown are Indian and domestic films. With the exception of the China-made "Song of the Police Soul," which was once packed, business is generally slow. The stage play has quietly increased its box-office record. The currently playing "Peacock Screen" and "Year-End Picture" are both very popular. Zhang Guang of the China Victory Theater Company is also rushing to rehearse Yang Hansheng's famous play "Outlaws," preparing for a Spring Festival performance. The cast is quite well-organized, and it is expected that the Youth Hall will once again be bustling.

There are "gangs" for fetching tap water, and there is a black market for buying movie tickets. Ordinary people without "gang" connections who line up to fetch water are often snatched from the front by those in the "gang" when it is their turn. The police can only stare and dare not interfere. When the movies are good, people who queue up in an orderly manner to buy tickets often have the good fortune of being told "sold out" when they finally reach the "window." Although these are two small matters, they easily discourage those who are law-abiding and encourage those who are not. If we want to reform the bad habits of society, we should start with these small things.

Parks built on slopes are a feature of this mountain city. Recently, with the winter sun shining brightly, the long, sloping lawns and the riverside tea houses have become places of recreation for people. Sipping tea by the river, talking intimately in the mist. Although it cannot compare with Xuanwu Lake in Nanjing or Zhongshan Park in Beiping, it has its own charm.

A few days ago, when the Chongqing District Court was in session, one of the parties referred to the judge as "Lord" and the female court clerk as "Madam." Would you believe that a citizen of the wartime capital in the 33rd year of the Republic would make such a joke?

Profession

### Darkness Often Appears Before My Eyes

— Ge Shangde

Darkness often appears before my eyes, an endless darkness.

Education is not a career that can be undertaken casually. Without a solid economic foundation, education, which is called a noble career by people, cannot take root, blossom, bear fruit, or reap beauty. Not only can it not reap beauty, but sometimes it can even produce unexpected evil consequences.

The school building is a rather beautiful private residence, which the school authorities have rented with great effort. A "private residence" is, after all, a private residence, and its conditions do not meet the requirements of a "school building." There is no playground here, and the only place for the nearly one hundred boarding students to do morning exercises is a narrow rooftop. Although the classrooms are not too narrow, some classes accommodate too many students, who are squeezed so tightly that they are like sardines in a can. When school started, parents insisted on sending their children to school despite the school's strong rejection, on the grounds that other schools were also full, so the school authorities should not bear this responsibility alone.

Every time I step into the classroom and see the tightly packed "sardines," I am discouraged and cannot muster the enthusiasm to teach.

The lack of spacious school buildings cannot restrain the students' active nature; on the contrary, precisely because there is no suitable place to play, they become more active. Roaring and jumping constitute a scene of commotion. No matter how well-trained a teacher is, it is not easy to "suppress" this commotion.

The disciplinary office is full of "rule violations." Sometimes I cannot help but reach out my trembling hand, stroking the heads of the students who have been "reprimanded," with tears in my eyes.

At the present stage, Shanghai is full of alley schools and "canned" classrooms like this. For two years, I have stepped onto the platforms of two universities, and for even more years, I have stepped onto the platforms of even more middle schools, and I have found that all those in front of the platforms are "sardines."

Kind-hearted people will surely sigh for the "sardines." But what causes kind-hearted people to sigh is surely not just the "sardines."

The four words "wearing clean sleeves" cannot describe the current plight of teachers' lives. The meager salary is not enough to cover one's own food, clothing, housing, and transportation: clothes and shoes are worn and torn; seeing the large pots of mixed beef and beef intestines that laborers are feasting on in the streets, one cannot help but drool; housing is a small pavilion room, squeezing the entire family; transportation relies only on the eleven-number automobile bestowed by the Creator. As for supporting one's parents and raising one's children, ah! How can one talk about supporting one's parents and raising one's children?

Although sometimes lying is a virtue, one cannot lie often, and this method will lose its effectiveness if used too often. My wife, who has been frowning and crying for more than ten years since we got married, often "joyfully" "pester" me.

"Did you bring the money?"

"I didn't bring it today." After saying that, I would remain silent. Or: "I only brought this much today." I would say, busy fumbling in my pocket. Then: "I can bring more next month, a lot, I'll give it to you." I would say, feeling proud of myself. In fact, I am spending tomorrow's money today, so I am not as good as those traveling boxers when it comes to "bragging."

Walking home from school, passing by the Bund, I would always stop and stare sadly at the endlessly flowing river for a long, long time.

The function of education is undeniable, but it is really not easy to maintain "confidence" in the education career at the present stage.

Darkness often appears before my eyes, an endless darkness.

### The Changshan Can Be Reformed

— Rong Huilan

I remember that before the war, someone advocated for the abolition of the changshan, which attracted a lot of attention at the time. Unfortunately, the advocacy did not last long, and the war broke out, so no one mentioned it again.

Now that peace has been initially established, victory belongs to us, and construction is just beginning, everything needs to be reformed and improved. Clothing, food, housing, and transportation are the four necessities of life, with clothing being the most important, so naturally it should be constructed and perfected in accordance with the principles of the new life. Looking back at our country since the founding of the Republic, there has been no standard and reasonable national costume. Although the late Premier Sun Yat-sen created the Zhongshan suit, it has not become widespread, and now even fewer people wear it, which is a pity!

As for the changshan, I think it is nothing more than costing more money to buy, taking more effort to make, and being inconvenient to wear. Other than that, it seems to have no special features. Look at those who wear the changshan, they must lift it up in the front and back when getting on and off vehicles and going up and down stairs, or when encountering wet and muddy roads. If they are not careful, it will be soiled or torn.

Some people say that wearing the changshan is to protect against wind and cold, which seems reasonable. But why do you still have to put on a changshan in the hot summer? If it is to be dignified, isn't the round-necked, wide-sleeved clothing of the Ming Dynasty more dignified? Besides, what is undignified about the Zhongshan suit? Moreover, the changshan, which Northerners call dagua, is a Manchu ceremonial dress that is worn on top of other clothes, so it is also called waigua or wai tao, and is a Manchu garment similar to the cheongsam. Therefore, the changshan can really be abolished today.

This construction, in a broad sense, is about promoting what is beneficial and eliminating what is harmful. Therefore, although this starts with the changshan, it further says that all unreasonable clothing should be thoroughly reformed. A standard and reasonable national costume should be constructed based on the principles of simplicity, plainness, practicality, convenience, and grandeur, so as to fully demonstrate the great spirit of the Yellow race. As for how to improve it, this naturally depends on the advocacy of powerful people and the design of experts. I am just throwing out a brick to attract jade.

National Conditions

### China's Industrialization

— Bao Zhongzuo

For centuries, the working efficiency of our handicrafts has been severely diminished, so the government is currently planning to implement a nationwide five-year industrialization plan to replace Japan and become the industrial authority of the Far East.

In order to assist our country in implementing this plan, the United States has sent the President's personal representatives to our country twice to inspect the economic situation, and plans to lend us huge sums of money to provide us with technicians and materials.

The Chinese government still has to overcome various difficulties, such as lack of transportation, lack of machinery and technicians, and basic economic problems such as domestic inflation.

After the implementation of the industrial plan, our country will be able to manufacture its own telephones, telegraphs, railway equipment, freight cars, bicycles, light bulbs, glass, cotton and woolen textiles, canned foods, rubber, and refrigerators and their accessories.

An industrialized China will not only improve the living standards of the people, but also become a country that does not owe foreign debt.

### Requirements for Cultivating Modern Youth
Qu Shen
In a certain youth academic speech, Mr. Lin Handa specifically raised the question of how to be a modern youth. He believed that every modern youth should possess at least the following points:
Optimism—Maintaining an optimistic spirit even in the face of difficulties.
Humor—Cultivating a habit of humor in helpless situations.
Democracy—Not just talking about it, but expressing the spirit of democracy in daily life.
Foolishness—Most scientific inventions and social reforms are created by "fools."
Targeting reality, we can find many young people today holding pessimistic arguments, speaking with a stern face, adopting autocratic styles, and engaging in some foolish acts.

Social Service Benefits Students Receiving Aid

Examination Results for Trainee Staff Announced

Students Admitted Expected to Report for Duty on the 23rd

Our newspaper's recruitment of four trainee staff and nine trainee students has been completed. Trainee staff require a university education, while trainee students require a high school education. This recruitment was limited to students receiving aid from our newspaper's scholarship fund, as they are all outstanding students from various schools with financial difficulties. They have been cultivated by the enthusiastic support of various sectors of society over the years and carefully selected by our newspaper. Many of them are unable to continue their education due to difficult family circumstances and are eager to find employment. Therefore, our newspaper is giving these students employment opportunities. Prior to this, our newspaper convened a meeting with aided students with high school education or above, encouraging them with the essence of serving society and assessing their service methods and abilities. From over 600 people, more than 70 were initially selected. On January 12th, the examination committee conducted a selection test in the auditorium of this newspaper. In the morning, mathematics, English, and Chinese were tested, and in the afternoon, individual oral tests were conducted. As a result of the evaluation, Zhao Liangfu, Wang Junkang, Ruan Rongxing, and Zheng Rongzhen were selected as trainee staff, who will be promoted to formal staff after one year of internship. Song Zhigang, Zhang Qingqi, He Shoufa, Fan Yongkang, Liu Cheng, Gan Yurui, Zheng Yilong, Zeng Buren, and Sun Yu were selected as trainee students, who will be promoted to formal staff after three years of internship. With the approval of our newspaper's authorities, all students are expected to report to the personnel department on the 23rd to complete the entry procedures and work conscientiously, without delay.

I want to reorganize my old business, but I have some questions, listed below: (1) Can the registration certificate from before the war be reused? (2) If the old registration certificate cannot be used, where is the competent authority for applying for registration? (3) What are the procedures?
Sincerely, Jin Guang

Lost and Found

Overdue Items to Be Used as Scholarship Funds

(I)

Dear Sirs: A few days ago, a bather in our bathroom lost a gold ring in the pool. Because the pool was large and the water was deep, it was difficult to find it for a while. We explained to the guest: "We will release the pool water after closing and pay attention to finding it. Please ask the accounting room tomorrow if it has been found." That night, the water was released, and a gold ring was found in the pool. It is now kept in the accounting room, waiting for the guest to pick it up. Unexpectedly, the guest has not returned for many days. Because we do not know the guest's name and address, we cannot return it. In order to return the item to the original owner, we hereby send a letter to your newspaper's social service column, hoping that the bather who lost the ring will come to claim it. Those who can describe the weight, style, and brand of the gold ring can take it back from our accounting room. The deadline is the end of this month. If you do not come after the deadline, the gold ring will be sent to your newspaper to donate to the scholarship fund for charity. Sincerely, Anle Pool Bathhouse, Yunnan South Road
