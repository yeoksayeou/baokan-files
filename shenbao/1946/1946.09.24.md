### Excited and Enthusiastic Crowd of Hundreds of Thousands; Nanchang Grand Meeting Welcomes Head of State; Chairman Delivers Address Urging Construction of a New Jiangxi

[Our Nanchang Dispatch, 23rd] Chairman Chiang may depart Nanchang on the 24th. It is rumored he will first go to Ganzhou, then fly to Guangdong for an inspection tour before returning to Nanjing within the week.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] Reliable sources indicate that this is Chairman Chiang's first visit to Jiangxi since the victory. He is deeply moved by the enthusiastic welcome of the Jiangxi people and plans to stay slightly longer, possibly delaying his return to Nanjing by a few days.

[Our Nanchang Dispatch, 23rd] The Jiangxi Provincial Capital's Grand Meeting to Welcome the Head of State, combined with an Enlarged Memorial Week, was held at 9:00 AM on the 23rd at the Nanchang Sports Field. Over two hundred units participated, with a crowd of up to 100,000 people. Over eight thousand demobilized officers from the Sixth Army Officer Corps also marched to the meeting, causing the meeting grounds and the Huanhu Road outside to be packed with welcoming crowds. However, the atmosphere at the meeting was extremely solemn and enthusiastic. As the bell tolled nine times, the composed and benevolent Chairman Chiang arrived by car. The entire audience stood at attention and welcomed him with applause. After the meeting began, led by Chairman Chiang, formalities were observed. First, Ouyang Wu, a 66-year-old respected elder, and Xu Ronggui, a 71-year-old farmer representative, presented a banner with the words "Eternal Loyalty to All Nations" to the Chairman on behalf of all sectors. The Chairman accepted it with a smile, repeatedly saying, "Thank you." Then, Xu Xiangxiang, representing the Youth League, presented a commemorative album with the signatures of 1,500 members. After the flag and commemorative album presentations, the Chairman delivered an address, urging everyone to work diligently and build a new Jiangxi [original text follows]. The address lasted forty-five minutes, and the crowd responded with enthusiastic applause, accepting his words of consolation and virtue. The meeting concluded with cheers of "Long live the Head of State," "Obey the Head of State," "Long live the Kuomintang of China," "Long live the Republic of China," and "Long live the Head of State." Amidst the cheers and music, the Head of State stepped out of the meeting grounds, repeatedly waving to thank the crowd for their respect. He then boarded his car and returned to the official residence.

Full Text of the Chairman's Address

[Central News Agency, Nanchang, 23rd] The following is the original text of Chairman Chiang's address delivered at 10:00 AM on the 23rd, at the Grand Meeting to Welcome the Head of State held by all sectors of Jiangxi Province!

Chairman Wang, elders and compatriots of all circles in Jiangxi, fellow military officers, and young people, today, after the victory of the War of Resistance, I, Zhongzheng, have come to Nanchang to meet with you, the elders and compatriots of all circles in Jiangxi. This is truly the most memorable, happiest, and most self-satisfying day of my life.

Great Contributions

Most of you elders and compatriots here today still remember that in the 15th year of the Republic [1926], I led the National Revolutionary Army on the Northern Expedition from Guangdong. After passing through Changsha, we quickly defeated the warlords in Jiangxi and recaptured Nanchang. Therefore, Nanchang was our first base for the Northern Expedition's advance. At the same time, all the men, women, old, and young compatriots in Jiangxi supported the National Government and were loyal to the National Revolution. Their contribution to the Northern Expedition was truly great. It can be said that the reason why the Northern Expedition was completed so quickly was largely due to the whole province of Jiangxi contributing money and effort, sincerely supporting it. This is a major event that I have never forgotten in the past twenty years. From the 20th year of the Republic [1931] to the 23rd year [1934], the entire province of Jiangxi was mired in long-term banditry. It can be said that there was no clean land in Jiangxi at that time. The lives of the compatriots were truly as deep as water and as hot as fire. When I first arrived in Nanchang, the general public's fear of bandits was almost worse than fear of floods or wild beasts. During this period, the total number of compatriots in Jiangxi who sacrificed their lives due to banditry was at least five million. As for the loss of property, it was even more immeasurable. However, since the implementation of the New Life Movement in the 22nd year of the Republic [1933], the fear of bandits has been completely changed. At that time, every man, woman, old, and young in Jiangxi was not only unafraid of bandits, but also deeply hated the inhuman acts of killing and arson committed by bandits. No matter what kind of difficulties and hardships we Jiangxi compatriots encountered, whether they were displaced or wandering, their loyalty to the government and their support for the revolution remained steadfast. From the beginning to the end, they believed in the government, obeyed orders, and worked together to avenge the bandits. Therefore, in less than two years, that滔天大禍 [lit. "滔天的大鍋 a huge disaster"] was extinguished. By the winter of the 23rd year [1934], social order had gradually stabilized. From this, it can be seen that we Jiangxi compatriots all have the enthusiasm for revolution, are able to protect their hometown and country, love their country and themselves, and truly deserve to be called modern citizens. Unfortunately, in the 26th year of the Republic [1937], the Japanese寇 [lit. "bandits" - a pejorative term for the Japanese] launched the Lugouqiao Incident, and our China launched a full-scale War of Resistance. During the eight years, the comrades and compatriots of the entire Jiangxi province, under the leadership of the government, obeyed orders and consistently fought to the death with the enemy. From this, it can be seen that Jiangxi has made even greater contributions to the victory of the War of Resistance. As you all remember, our national policy of resisting Japan and all subsequent plans for the War of Resistance were decided in Lushan, Jiangxi. It can be said that Jiangxi is the birthplace of the victory of the War of Resistance. In short, Jiangxi has made indelible contributions to the development of the National Revolution in the past twenty years. It occupies the most glorious page in the history of the Chinese Revolution. We, the compatriots of the entire province, must unanimously cherish, promote, and carry forward this historical glory, so that it will last forever.

Using the Spirit of the New Life Movement to Build Jiangxi into a Model Province

However, this time when I came to Jiangxi, it happened to be after a long period of the War of Resistance, and the local area was devastated and the people were suffering. I cannot help but feel sad and worried. However, based on past experience, I am confident that the spirit of construction and the power of recovery of our Jiangxi compatriots are no less than those of any province in China. From the 19th year of the Republic [1930], Jiangxi experienced six years of long-term banditry, but by the time the banditry was suppressed in the 24th year [1935], not only did social order quickly recover, but also all sectors of agriculture, industry, and commerce had a thriving atmosphere. In particular, the construction undertaking was advancing rapidly. Within just two years, from the 24th year [1935] to the 26th year [1937], the Gan-Zhe and Gan-Xiang railways were completed, all the main highways of the province were completed, and this Ganjiang Bridge was built. Other educational and economic constructions are even more numerous to mention. This great construction power is something we should particularly encourage and develop. I believe that if the Jiangxi compatriots can work together diligently under the leadership of the provincial government, as in the past, then within three years, Jiangxi Province will definitely be built into a national model province.

Speaking of this, there is one more point that I want to bring to the attention of all of you: The main reason why we Jiangxi were able to achieve such great achievements in the past in the revolution, the War of Resistance, and the suppression of bandits was because we had a spiritual strength. What is this spiritual strength? It is the New Life Movement that I advocated in Nanchang on February 19th of the 22nd year of the Republic [1933]. The essence of this movement is to incorporate the four cardinal principles of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame into the daily lives of clothing, food, housing, and transportation, and to achieve the goal of improving the national spirit and promoting national morality through the reform of daily life. This movement also originated in your Jiangxi, and later was widely promoted to the whole country. I believe that this movement has had the greatest impact on the success of suppressing bandits at that time and the victory of the War of Resistance today. In the future, the work of nation-building will be even more arduous than the past War of Resistance. Therefore, I hope even more that our Jiangxi compatriots will follow the spirit of the era when we first implemented the New Life Movement, understand propriety and righteousness, know integrity and shame, be responsible, abide by discipline, be diligent and hardworking, and work hard to complete the construction of our new Jiangxi.

Helping Demobilized Military Officers to Continue Efforts in Nation-Building

Finally, when I came to Nanchang, I also saw that the students of our Officer Corps were welcomed and cared for by the general compatriots, and they were loving and sincere to each other, helping each other and cooperating with each other. I felt very gratified in my heart. As you all know, in the past twenty years, all officers and soldiers of our National Revolutionary Army have been sacrificing and fighting hard all the time. It can be said that they have not had a day of peace following my command. After the Northern Expedition, they continued with the suppression of bandits. After the suppression of bandits, they continued with the War of Resistance. Their merits and achievements deserve the love and respect of compatriots throughout the country and should be remembered forever. However, after the victory of the War of Resistance, more than 150,000 officers retired under the order of the government, abandoning their existing military positions and sacrificing their lofty status. This major event can be said to be an unprecedented feat in Chinese history. This is the greatest progress in Chinese politics and military affairs, and it is also the highest expression of the patriotic personality and revolutionary spirit of all Chinese soldiers. This proves that today's truly patriotic and people-loving troops and officers have no selfish or self-interested concepts, only a pure and bright heart, loyal to the country and caring for their compatriots. Therefore, our compatriots must continue to love, help, and support these national military officers who obey orders and sacrifice themselves, with the spirit of supporting the government and loving the National Revolutionary Army in the past twenty years, so that they can continue to serve the country and participate in the work of nation-building after ending their military life. Only in this way can we express the utmost sincerity of our general compatriots in respecting virtue and rewarding merit. Our military officers and compatriots must cherish themselves, be diligent, and be law-abiding, so as to be a model for society and a model for the people, so that they can truly complete the mission of the National Revolutionary Army in resisting Japan and building the nation.

Today, I, Zhongzheng, am meeting with the elders and compatriots of Jiangxi, and I feel extremely happy in my heart. There is no other way to express my gratitude and consolation except with a heart full of enthusiasm and sincerity. I am willing to encourage each other with my Jiangxi compatriots to strive for the construction of a new Jiangxi and a new China. I wish all Jiangxi compatriots health and progress.

### Chairman Holds Tea Party to Entertain Guests; Receives Director Cai to Instruct on Relief Work

[Central News Agency, Nanchang, 23rd] Chairman Chiang held a tea party to entertain Chinese and foreign guests at the Provincial Government Auditorium at 4:30 PM on the 23rd. Those who attended included Duncan, the UNRRA representative in Jiangxi, Schmidt, the head of the Catholic Church, Gao Suifu, the Christian pastor, Peng Chengwan and Ouyang Wu, local gentry, and Zhou Lingyuan and Hu Dexin, descendants of the late military commanders Zhou Hunyuan and Hu Zuyu, totaling over a hundred people. During the tea party, the Chairman stood up and gave a speech, repeatedly expressing his concerns about the construction of Jiangxi. He briefly stated that construction must proceed from small to large, from near to far. The construction of Jiangxi should start from Nanchang, and the construction of the whole country should start from Jiangxi. Jiangxi has a glorious past culture, intelligent people, and superior material conditions. If it can be supplemented by modern scientific organization and other technologies, the construction achievements will definitely advance rapidly. Finally, the Chairman encouraged all parties in Jiangxi, including the party, government, and military, to work together diligently under the leadership of Chairman Wang. He believed that within three to five years, Jiangxi could definitely become a national model province. The Chairman praised the work of UNRRA and hoped that everyone would emulate the work spirit and methods of Westerners. After the speech, the entire audience applauded unanimously. The tea party ended at about 6:00 PM in joy.

[Another Dispatch] Chairman Chiang received Cai Mengjian, the Director of the UNRRA Jiangxi Branch, on the 23rd and gave detailed instructions on relief work. Also, during the tea party on the 23rd, the Chairman greatly praised the work spirit of Duncan, the UNRRA representative in Jiangxi, and his foreign staff, as well as their close cooperation with the UNRRA Branch. He also stated that farmland water conservancy is very important and should be strengthened.

### Zhang Lisheng Talks to Our Reporter About the Government's Attitude Towards the Current Situation; Judging Facts Rationally and Awaiting Results Patiently

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] When Zhang Lisheng answered our reporter's inquiry about discussing the situation on the 23rd, he briefly stated that although peace talks are currently stalled, all parties are still in constant contact. We should judge facts rationally and await results patiently, and believe that there is still hope for success.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] At 11:00 AM, Situ Lei's personal advisor, Fu Jingbo, talked with the visiting Pi Zonggan for about 45 minutes. There were no other activities. According to observations from various parties, it seems that everyone is waiting for Chairman Chiang to return to Nanjing before any progress can be made. A spokesperson for the Communist Party delegation said tonight that Mr. Zhou Enlai is in Shanghai waiting for news. As soon as the Military Mediation Group meeting is scheduled, Zhou will immediately return to Nanjing.

### Wu Tiecheng and Four Others Held a Discussion Meeting Yesterday

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] During the political negotiation process, after the Communist Party submitted the second memorandum yesterday, government representatives still had contact with each other today, except for the Communist Party representatives who did not travel back and forth, showing that while waiting for the Chairman to return to Nanjing, the government side still wanted to find appropriate ways to achieve peace. After the KMT memorial week on the morning of the 23rd, Wu Dingfu, Wu Tiecheng, Shao Lizi, Peng Xuepei, and Wang Shijie held a discussion meeting to discuss the current situation. At noon, Wu Tiecheng went to General Chen's residence on Putuo Road and talked with Chen for a long time, and had lunch together. Many believe that the government representatives are studying the requests made in the Communist Party's memorandum. It is also heard that Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Lisheng, Yu Dawei, and others will dine at the US Embassy on the evening of the 24th to discuss the situation.

### Ambassador Marshall Discusses General Issues with Yu Dawei

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] Special Envoy Marshall received Yu Dawei at his residence at 8:45 AM on the 23rd and talked until 11:50 AM. According to Yu, they were still discussing general issues of the current situation, but many believe that they were studying the contents of the Communist Party's memorandum. The main purpose of the memorandum is to convene the Military Mediation Group meeting. Yu is the representative of Xu Yongchang, the government representative in the Military Mediation Group.

[Reuters, Nanjing, 23rd] The efforts of Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart have temporarily stalled. Reliable sources say that Marshall and Stuart do not intend to launch mediation again for the time being. It is expected that the stalemate will not change in any way before Chairman Chiang returns to Nanjing. Marshall does not intend to respond to the memorandum submitted by the Communist Party before exchanging views with Chairman Chiang.

### Our Country Signs the International Monetary Fund; Exchange Rate Changes Are Restricted; Economic Experts Discuss Currency Depreciation

[Reuters, Nanjing, 23rd] Although the official solemnly declared that the exchange rate would never change, the foreign exchange market in Nanjing still changed according to the Shanghai market. Today's black market rate was 3,550 法幣 [legal tender] per US dollar, and large bills could only get 3,400 法幣 [legal tender]. It seems that those who deal in US dollars generally expect the price to rise. According to an economic expert who has a close relationship with China's monetary system, China is a signatory to the International Monetary Fund. The Fund stipulated a month ago that each member state should register its permanent stable exchange rate of its currency against major gold standard currencies (i.e., US dollars, British pounds, and French francs) with the Fund within three months of issuing the final notice. The purpose is to prevent any significant devaluation of each country's currency before the specified deadline. After the deadline is reached, China and every other signatory country will be bound by its registered exchange rate. If the domestic situation requires the currency to be devalued again, the value of the devaluation must not exceed one-tenth, and this adjustment must be implemented at least six months after registration. Responsible observers know that a 13% readjustment is not enough to cope with the devaluation that may occur frequently. Therefore, it is necessary to announce a final devaluation once again within two months. If, unfortunately, the situation continues to deteriorate after this devaluation, China still has the right to withdraw the devaluation restriction from the International Monetary Fund, but this move is tantamount to declaring national bankruptcy to the world, which no country would be willing to do.

[United Press, Tianjin, 23rd] After rumors in Shanghai that the official exchange rate of 法幣 [legal tender] against the US dollar would be adjusted again, the market price of the US dollar in the open market here has reached a new peak. As of now, the highest price is 3,610 法幣 [legal tender].

### The Eastern Section of the Longhai Railway Will Be Open to Traffic Tomorrow

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] The railway between Kaifeng and Xuzhou in the eastern section of the Longhai Railway was severely damaged by the 共軍 [Communist forces]. Military conditions have improved recently, and the repair work on this section has progressed very rapidly. Within a week, the entire 194-li damaged section has been repaired. The Ministry of Communications received a call from Xuzhou on the 23rd that the road will be open to traffic on the 25th.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] It is reported that the transportation authorities are considering extending the western section of the Longhai Railway to Lanzhou and have sent experts to Tianshui for field research. After the westward expansion of the railway line, it will be very beneficial to the development of the Yumen oil mine and the consolidation of the northwest border defense.

### Ma Zhanshan is Transferred to a New Position

Deputy Commander of Northeast Security

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 23rd] Ma Zhanshan, Deputy Commander of the Twelfth War Area and Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Advance Army, has now been transferred to Deputy Commander of the Northeast Security.

### Fu Zuoyi Flew from Suiyuan to the Former Capital; Important Meetings Held in Peiping; Contact Occurred on the Eastern Front of Chahar Yesterday

[Our Peiping Dispatch, 23rd] The battle for Zhangjiakou is imminent. Important consultations were held by the military authorities in Peiping tonight. Fu Zuoyi, commander of the Twelfth War Area, flew from Suiyuan to Peiping on a special plane today, arriving here at noon. There has been no news of war on the Qinghuangdao [Qinhuangdao] side of the Peiping-Suiyuan Railway. The war in eastern Suiyuan and northern Shanxi has gradually passed. 聂荣臻 [Nie Rongzhen]'s troops, 13,000 strong, have fled from Datong along the Peiping-Suiyuan line to Yanggao. 萧克 [Xiao Ke]'s troops and 葉寧 [Ye Ning]'s troops withdrew in a straight line to Zhangjiakou. Communist troops, 2,000 strong, have infiltrated from Xinglong and Deqing in the southwest, attempting to threaten the flank of the National Army and destroy communications.

[Our Peiping Dispatch, 23rd] It is certain that the National Army will launch a three-pronged attack on Zhangjiakou. The steps will be decided tonight and the advance will officially begin. The Eleventh War Area Command in Peiping will hold an important military meeting tonight to echo the First War Area. Other important military commanders are scheduled to fly to Peiping this afternoon to participate in this meeting. Also, the security team of the Chahar Provincial Government stationed in Nankou has received notification and will advance with the army tonight.

[Our Peiping Dispatch, 23rd] It is certain that the Kangzhuang area on the left and right front of the first line of defense of the Communist Army in eastern Chahar has been in frequent contact with the National Army since yesterday. Several small strongholds have been taken over by the National Army. This is the prelude to the National Army's official advance. Kangzhuang is now within range of the National Army's artillery, and once the battle begins, it can be quickly captured. It is heard that the new tactics adopted by the National Army in the future will be to make the Communist Army in important strongholds retreat on their own. Also, Xiaogezhuang, 13 kilometers west of Shunyi on the Peiping-Gubei line, was captured by four regiments of Communist troops transferred from eastern Hebei last night. The battle was quite fierce. The National Army is now counterattacking. The actions of this Communist force seem to be aimed at containing the advance of the National Army on the Peiping-Suiyuan Road and threatening the Peiping-Gubei Road.

[Our Peiping Dispatch, 23rd] The newly recovered routes are being actively repaired. The western section of the Peiping-Suiyuan Road has been opened to Fengzhen and will be opened to Datong within days. The Peiping-Gubei line has been repaired to near Shixia. Also, the tracks between Tangshan and Kaiping on the Peiping-Ningbo Road were blown up by a landmine this morning and were quickly repaired.

[Agence France-Presse, Zhangjiakou, 22nd] The rumor that the airfield here has been destroyed is not true. A plane from the Peiping Executive Headquarters landed safely here today and carried away a radio operator from the government group because he was suffering from tonsillitis, which was quite serious.

[Agence France-Presse, Zhangjiakou, 22nd] Except for one air raid alarm every day, there are no visible signs of tension on the surface. Most residents are still living their normal and peaceful lives. A government offensive against Zhangjiakou seems imminent.

### A Great Feat in History: 150,000 Men Lay Down Their Armor; Soldiers Are Truly Fine Men; Chairman Praises the Sixth Officer Corps

[Our Nanchang Dispatch, 23rd] At the grand meeting in Nanchang, the provincial capital, to welcome the Head of State on the morning of the 23rd, Chairman Chiang, after comforting the people of Jiangxi, publicly praised the Sixth Officer Corps for its great achievements. He expressed great satisfaction with the unity and close cooperation between the more than 10,000 surplus officers of the corps and the 200,000 citizens of Nanchang, which had been well received by all parties. At this point, the Chairman, in a moving speech, especially mentioned that after the victory, the government, in accordance with its established policy, reorganized the national army to complete the major task of military demobilization. After an order was issued, the work of streamlining the army immediately took effect. To date, at least 150,000 officers have obeyed the order to retire and enter various officer corps to receive various retraining suitable for national reconstruction needs. This is a great feat unprecedented in history (loud applause). The soldiers of the Republic of China are all aware of the importance of today's national reconstruction mission. Our national reconstruction work, once completed, can be completed (loud applause from 100,000 people in the entire venue). This is indeed a rare miracle in the five thousand years of our Chinese nation.

When this reporter visited the Qingyunpu Sixth Officer Corps on the 13th of this month to inquire about the vocational training of the major detachments under the corps, the teaching guidelines for retraining, the retraining aspirations and numbers of various officers, the morale of the surplus officers entering the corps for training, the views of the surplus officers on the future of the country, and the ideas of the surplus officers on their own prospects, the reporter could not help but say to his colleagues that the government's plan for retraining surplus officers, formulated in order to thoroughly implement the major task of military demobilization, is unprecedented in ancient and modern times, both at home and abroad. Compared with the backward thinking of "releasing military power with a cup of wine and dividing the land to enfeoff vassals" in the Han and Tang dynasties, it is truly a million times more brilliant and five thousand years more advanced. Our 450 million compatriots should not just verbally support the Head of State and obey the Head of State, but should experience the Head of State's painstaking efforts and virtues from the Head of State's invented major plans for saving the country and building the country, and support the Head of State's research and development of a major plan for streamlining the army and demobilizing soldiers that is more courageous than the Han and Tang dynasties and wiser than Europe and the United States. This is because Emperor Gaozu of Han and Emperor Taizong of Tang did not have retraining and resettlement measures for demobilizing soldiers, while Europe and the United States had demobilization measures but no retraining. Enhance the martial virtues of the Chinese nation to solve the most dangerous and troublesome problem of reducing troops in the five thousand years of the Chinese nation.

Chairman Chiang was very happy to hear and see everything about the retraining of our country's officers after coming to Nanchang this time. He personally comforted General Chen Pei, the commander of the Sixth Officer Corps, and the three deputy commanders and seven battalion commanders for their efforts to solve the difficulties of various surplus officers. If the surplus officers themselves and their families have major difficulties, they can be reported to the Chairman by General Chen Pei for resolution. After this news was announced, the 8,000 surplus officers who participated in the meeting to welcome the Head of State today did not feel tired at all, even though they walked for five hours to and fro and stood for two hours. Among them, some had served as commanders and deputy commanders, and some had served as military division commanders, but now they eat, live, dress, and walk like a soldier. It is not a step backward but a step forward for senior officers to be able to relive the life of a soldier and even enjoy it. The officers who are incorporated into the Sixth Officer Corps and continue to receive academic and professional training, in terms of retraining, in September, the number of people is as follows: infantry 9,428, cavalry 48, artillery 148, engineers 244, transportation 36, communications 214, civil engineering 14, military police 124, political work 298, quartermaster 349, accounting 53, technology 11, military dependents 151, military doctors 243, for a total of 11,456 people. Among them, the retraining aspirations of the surplus officers are as follows: 206 in transportation, 1,904 in industry, railways, post offices, aviation, electricity, and police administration, 1,334 new army cadres, 16 conscription classes, 485 administrative officials, 449 in agriculture, forestry, and reclamation, 420 for further studies, 345 in labor service, 215 in popular compulsory education, 1,536 in mining plant management, 305 in finance, 5 to study in the United States, 204 in local health, 80 in the Army University, and 54 officials, for a total of 9,330 people. The rank of the surplus personnel in the corps is as follows: lieutenant general 11, major general 73, colonel 509, major 876, captain 2,400, lieutenant 2,162, second lieutenant 2,295, warrant officer 1,189. It was also found that the total number of officers in the Sixth Officer Corps undergoing retraining in September was 9,700. As of today, the total number of people allocated is as follows: 9,700 total members in September, 447 who retired and left the team, 142 who volunteered to go to the Northeast, 1,929 retired, 9 discharged, and 2,100 transferred to the provincial training corps. (Independent retraining) 24 in agricultural reclamation, 74 in finance, and 22 in land surveying. (Transferred to Xuzhou) 41 designated, 330 not designated, 572 participating in aquaculture training, 241 new army cadres, 375 technical officers, 333 policemen, 856 officer districts, and 61 in news. From the above statistics, we can imagine the importance of the tasks of the other 25 corps in the country from the organization, number of people, and achievements of the Sixth Officer Corps. We hope that all officer corps will have good results and use the facts to slap the faces of those new warlords who hold soldiers to harm the people. We should cheer, based on the brilliant results of the current streamlining of the army, "150,000 men lay down their armor; soldiers are truly fine men."

### The Situation in Northern Jiangsu Will Soon Be Clarified; The National Army Tightens the Encirclement; The Northern and Southern Lines Are Advancing in Coordination

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 23rd] After the National Army recovered Lianghuai, the Communist Army in Northern Jiangsu has lost its main stronghold. The Battle of Huaiyin was a crucial turning point in the situation in Northern Jiangsu. In that battle, the Communist Army mobilized 24 regiments, personally commanded by Chen Yi, to resist stubbornly. The National Army recovered the city, causing the Communist Army more than 20,000 casualties and capturing 5,000 people. Most of the elite forces have been lost. Following the Battle of Huai'an, more than 5,000 Communist troops were annihilated. The remnants of the Communist Army are like fallen leaves in the autumn wind, having lost their combat effectiveness, and are fleeing to Lianshui. The National Army is currently pursuing them in the area east of Lianghuai. The National Army on the southern line of Northern Jiangsu, in coordination with the progress of the northern line, is tightening the encirclement of the Communist Army from the Yangtai fronts. The Communist forces in Dongtai, the airport, Xinghua, Gaoyou, Binying, and Lianshui are all shaken. This reporter visited a senior general of the National Army in Xuzhou today, who predicted that there would be no major battles in the future of Northern Jiangsu, and that the National Army would clarify the situation in Northern Jiangsu in the shortest possible time.

[Our Taixian Dispatch, 23rd] In addition to continuing to mop up the suburbs of Huai'an, the main force of the National Army is currently advancing towards Cheqiao.

[Another dispatch] Related parties stated that the recovery of Lianghuai dealt a fatal blow to the Communist Army in Northern Jiangsu. In the future, the National Army may divide its forces into two routes, one advancing to Lianshui to complete the northern encirclement, and the other advancing directly north to Gaobin, making contact with the National Army in Yangtai, and connecting the canal embankment. At this point, the Communist Army lurking in the lake and swamp area in central Northern Jiangsu will retreat without a fight.

[Another dispatch] There is still no major progress in the battles on the eastern front. The troops heading north are still滞留near Bin'an. The bridges and communication facilities on the Haitai Highway have been severely damaged by the Communist Army and are difficult to repair for the time being. The Communist Army in Xiaoji, Fanchuan, and Xinghua has been continuously reinforcing Gaobin in recent days. Yangbin will defend the canal embankment to the death. It is expected that if the Communist Army suffers another惨败on the canal embankment, it may continue to守住 the Gouwen west of the Fan public堤壩, so that the Communist Army can have a retreat route.

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 23rd] According to official sources, the Communist Army in the Lianshui, Shuyang, and Gouyun areas has recently completely captured young men and women and moved them to southern Shandong and Yanfu. The area with the most severe Communist captures is near Gaojiagou, at the junction of Lianshui and Shuyang. All young men and women have been taken away, with no one left behind. According to the current situation, the Communist Army is about to abandon Lianshui.

[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 23rd] Wang Bingnan, a spokesman for the Chinese Communist Party, said today that the Communist Army will adopt large-scale guerrilla tactics throughout the country. Except for Harbin and Zhangjiakou, the Communist Army will abandon all strongholds. The loss of Huaiyin and Huai'an is only the beginning of the Northern Jiangsu campaign. In the future, the Communist Army may be forced to retreat from Binying and Gaoyou, which is not necessarily the case.

### Flour for Northern Jiangsu Refugees Has Not Yet Arrived; The Chairman Has Ordered the Executive Yuan to Expedite the Matter

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] Five thousand tons of flour for relieving Northern Jiangsu refugees were allocated by the Executive Yuan to the Su-Ning branch in early September, but have not yet been delivered, preventing the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association from providing practical benefits to the refugees. When the Chairman was in Gu嶺, he ordered Director Chiang to expedite the matter. Furthermore, the flour that the Executive Yuan should have allocated to Northern Jiangsu refugees for relief in May has also not been delivered.

### Communist Army in Shandong Province Busy With Mobilization; Military Conference Held in Yucheng

[Our Jinan Dispatch, 23rd] The Communist Army's attempt to launch a war in Shandong has become increasingly apparent. The government has received reports that the headquarters of the Communist Army's Bohai Military Region has moved to Yucheng City in northern Shandong to conduct business. A military conference is currently being held to decide to start military activities, eliminate the National Army on the north bank of the Yellow River, and plot to destroy transportation and blow up the Yellow River Railway Bridge. The National Army has taken strict precautions. The Communist Army in southern Shandong is still busy with mobilization, with about 10,000 people near Yanzhou.

[Our Jinan Dispatch, 22nd] The National Army is now using the seven county towns of Caoxian, Heze, Chengwu, Dingtao, Jinxiang, Shanxian, and Jining as bases to continue to expand into the countryside and eliminate the remaining Communist troops. The situation in western Shandong has been largely stabilized. The refugees from these counties who had fled to other provinces have been returning to their hometowns in groups, supporting the old and carrying the young. The scenes of songs and vehicles filling the roads and the enthusiastic atmosphere are only seen after victory. The Communist Army near Yanzhou Qushi has launched attacks on the National Army again in recent days. Its 16th regiment of the police brigade, with more than 500 people, attacked the National Army's outposts at Jinkouba and the airport near Yanzhou from the east bank of the Si River at dawn on the 21st. After being met with a head-on attack by the National Army, a fierce battle ensued for about half an hour. More than 30 Communist troops were killed, and the rest retreated to the original location of Daliushu陵城. In addition, more than 300 Communist troops attacked the guard unit of the Datanchang east of Jining on the 20th, but were repelled by the National Army.

### Minister of Communications Yu Reports at the Memorial Week; Postal and Telecommunications Rates Will Be Increased; Railway Construction and Restoration Will Be Carried Out in Separate Zones

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] The central memorial week was held at 9:00 am on the 23rd. President Dai Chuanxian presided over the meeting, and Minister of Communications Yu Dawei reported on the recent situation of transportation, briefly analyzing the current situation of railways, highways, waterways, aviation, postal services, and telecommunications. Yu stated that the current focus of transportation is on the construction and restoration of railways, which is being carried out in the southwest, northwest, and Bohai Road as the boundary between South China and North China. However, there are many difficulties, such as the lack of road construction materials, low freight rates, and lack of training for railway employees, which have greatly affected the progress of the work. Therefore, it is urgent to plan to restore the highways built during the war in various places to supplement the railways' shortcomings. At the same time, local governments are encouraged to build roads, especially the southwest highway, which is extremely important, and efforts will be made to maintain it. Waterway transportation is also being improved and port affairs are being reorganized. As for aviation, the biggest difficulty at present is the lack of equipment and facilities, and the lack of aircraft is secondary. The current losses are unbearable and cannot be maintained without price increases. Therefore, it is planned to increase prices at an appropriate time, but not to increase them too much.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] This reporter visited Minister of Communications Yu Dawei in the evening to inquire about the postal and telecommunications price increase plan. Yu stated that the price increase is inevitable, but the time of implementation is still uncertain. When asked if it might be brought up at the Executive Yuan meeting on the 24th, Yu repeatedly said, "No."

Editorial

### The Four Foreign Ministers Gather in Paris

The Paris Peace Conference has been going on for a month, and no agreement has been reached. All parties are concerned and eager to see progress. The war has just ended, and the opinions of various countries on rebuilding the European peace order are not entirely the same, and they do not want to act rashly. This is the phenomenon that should exist in creating peace. Therefore, we should not be disappointed by the slow progress of the Paris Peace Conference. While the Paris Peace Conference was in progress, we saw the US Secretary of State, the Soviet Foreign Minister, and the British Foreign Minister leave Paris one after another to go to Moscow, inspect the occupied areas of Germany, or return to London. Later, we saw US Secretary of State Byrnes' speech in Germany and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's speech in the committee meeting, explaining the diplomatic policies of the United States and the Soviet Union. At this time, US Secretary of Commerce Wallace delivered a speech in the United States, advocating appeasement of the Soviet Union, which caused an uproar and widespread criticism. Wallace had to resign. Now that Wallace has resigned, the storm caused by Wallace's speech has gradually subsided, and the four foreign ministers have gathered in Paris again. The Paris Peace Conference, which had been stagnating, may become active again, and the long-delayed foreign ministers' meeting may also be reconvened. Thus, after a period of stagnation and turbulence, Paris will once again become the center of international diplomatic activity. Based on the developments of the past few weeks, we would like to make a prospect of international politics.

The world situation in the year since the armistice has clearly stopped the coordination that existed during the war due to the cessation of hostilities. Originally, the maintenance of this coordination lacked a solid practical foundation and was only a wartime compromise. In order to maintain this wartime compromise, Roosevelt, who advocated international justice, did not hesitate to abandon the principles he upheld and the position he occupied, and not only built a high iron curtain with the Soviet Union, but also spread the "new democracy" of its socialist country outside the iron curtain. The post-war world was clearly shrouded in this atmosphere. Under these circumstances, Wallace advocated returning to a new "glorious isolation," regarding China as a "uncivilized place," and watching the sparks of Europe and the Far East across the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Although this Wallace doctrine appears to be a "new isolationism," it actually inherits some of the mantle of the Anglo-American appeasement policy before the Second World War. Therefore, we cannot but seek the foreign policies of Britain and the United States from other aspects.

US Secretary of State Byrnes' speech in Stuttgart clarified the US government's enlightened policy towards post-war Europe. Later, British wartime Prime Minister Churchill also delivered a speech in Switzerland, advocating the establishment of a European Federation, so that Europe could almost recover its prosperity. Churchill, as a person out of office, cannot represent the intentions of the British government. However, the Labor Party, which is currently in power in Britain, although advocating the implementation of socialism, which is considered "unscientific" by Marxists and Leninists, cannot be compared with the Soviet Union's "new democracy." Therefore, Churchill's speech may also represent the opinions of some British people. The ideal of a European Federation is not new to Europeans. After the First World War, French politicians advocated the establishment of a European Federation. However, at that time, the situation made the ideal a mere dream. Now that Europe is feeling threatened again, it may be that the people of Europe will feel the need for such an organization. However, whether it can be formed is still vague.

Will such an evolution make the world one world, or will it become two? In reality, one world is only a lofty ideal, and the real divide has long existed! The world is in troubled times. Of course, we do not want to see the distance of the divide widening, and we would rather pray that everyone should fill this divide at this time. However, in the effort to fill this divide, we have the right to demand that all major countries make concessions for the overall safety of mankind, and we cannot rely on us alone, even at the expense of sacrificing the principles we uphold, like President Roosevelt, to accommodate reality. How to strive to fill this divide depends on the achievements of the foreign ministers in Paris.

### The Door to US-Soviet Cooperation

We have already discussed Wallace's resignation in our newspaper yesterday. For the sake of the global situation, we naturally feel that since Wallace's speech cannot represent the US government's foreign policy, the US government has the need to ask him to step down in order to seek consistency with the outside world. However, we still very much regret the occurrence of this unfortunate fact. Because, the door to US-Soviet cooperation seems to be separated by a layer of curtains again.

Here, we would like to state another view: Wallace's foreign policy is to make concessions to the Soviet Union, while Byrnes' foreign policy is to be tough on the Soviet Union. This difference is very clear. Can concessions gain the cooperation of the Soviet Union? Can toughness gain the submission of the Soviet Union? No one can predict these two points. However, Byrnes' tough policy, to date, seems not only to have failed to make the Soviet Union dare to do things, but has instead made the barriers between the US and the Soviet Union increasingly sharp. Wallace's foreign policy, standing in the position of the Americans, seems to have a need for experimentation.

The two biggest points in Wallace's speech and letter to Truman are that, in addition to his own "deep belief" that the serious problem of mutual distrust between the US and the Soviet Union due to different political and economic systems can be solved, he does not have a definite grasp. The opposition between the US and the Soviet Union, as pointed out in our editorial on the 19th, is a conflict of two kinds of democracy, in other words, the conflict between American democracy and Soviet communism. Wallace's plan for US-Soviet reconciliation focuses purely on military and economic aspects, and ignores the lofty ideals of these two human politics. Wallace was originally an agricultural expert and also served as Secretary of Commerce, specializing in agriculture and commerce, which makes him easily tend to overemphasize the superficial phenomena of human life and easily ignore the ideological activities of human beings to promote the realization of superficial phenomena.

Thought is the source of phenomena. According to Hegel, the human spirit, with the evolution of history, demands its own realization everywhere and at all times. Now the struggle between the US and the Soviet Union, the struggle between the two major blocs in the world, is not a struggle for atomic bombs and naval bases and ports, but a struggle for two great ideologies to demand their own realization. The fourteen communist leaders in the Kremlin, in order to realize the ideas they inherited from Marx, are willing to pay any price, take any means, and no international treaty can bind them. Under these circumstances, unless American society undergoes a fundamental revolution and becomes a Soviet-style "new democracy," US-Soviet cooperation is still not guaranteed. Even Wallace himself has not told Americans how much certainty there is.

However, Soviet-style "new democracy" is not welcomed by Americans except for a very small number of communists. Not only capitalists do not welcome it, but even workers do not necessarily welcome it. The United States today is the most prosperous country, and the living standards of its people are higher than anywhere else in the world. Since life is comfortable and they enjoy a high degree of democratic freedom, American workers have the least awareness of communist revolution among all the workers in the world. And the United States has no hope at all; even in other democratic countries, unless it is within its own military scope, there is no hope. The Greek referendum is a clear example. Human beings want to live, but they also want freedom. The biggest shortcoming of Soviet-style "new democracy" is that the people have no freedom!

Some people believe that Wallace's speech was a kind of probe by the White House in the United States. The US government is unwilling to go to war and is willing to cooperate with the Soviet Union, but any cooperation is not a one-sided matter. Since the US President allowed Wallace to deliver a speech, if the Soviet Union has a sincere response to cooperation, the US's tough foreign policy towards the Soviet Union may not be gradually changed. If this observation is correct, then President Truman's request for Wallace to resign is a manifestation of his continued disappointment after hope! Because since Wallace's speech was published, in addition to praising Wallace and scolding Byrnes, the Soviet government has not made any specific representations. Under such an attitude from the Soviet Union, President Truman had no reason to adopt Wallace's proposal and offer the secrets of the atomic bomb to Marshal Stalin with both hands.

We very much regret Wallace's resignation, because his speech did open the door to US-Soviet cooperation, but now that the guests are not coming, Wallace has resigned, and this door seems to have closed again. But we still hope that this door can be opened again at any time, and we believe that it will be opened again one day. In China, we pray that the door to US-Soviet cooperation will be opened sooner. Those in power in the United States may wish to learn more about the Soviet Union and study the background of communist thought; Soviet leaders may also wish to step out of the Kremlin and take a look at the true face of the world. When they understand each other, it will be when world peace truly sprouts.

### The Necessity of Suppressing High-Interest Loans

High-interest loans are one of the most troublesome problems currently faced by the industrial and commercial sectors.

On one hand, there is rampant inflation, and on the other hand, there is a feeling of surplus capital with no outlet. According to normal theory, interest rates should be low at this time, and high-interest loans should not occur. However, theory is theory, and reality is reality. Such contradictory phenomena are not limited to this one issue in the current economic sphere.

Thus, the Four Banks' tight monetary policy has drawn special attention from the general public. All kinds of loans are being applied for continuously by various regions and industries; the withdrawal amounts from commercial banks are also being heavily discussed; whether loans exceeding 50 million must be approved by the Four Banks is also being widely criticized; some people have even raised the fundamental question of whether the Four Banks should continue to exist.

The Four Banks tighten monetary supply and refuse to extend loans, of course, have their legitimate reasons. From their perspective, stabilizing prices and avoiding further stimulation should be the main reasons. Recalling the beginning of the establishment of the grain loan, within two or three days, rice prices in various places experienced a huge surge. Therefore, their cautious attitude can be said to be well-founded.

However, the existence of high-interest loans now is a fact, the difficulty in turnover felt by general industrial and commercial businesses is also a fact, and the bankruptcy of many factories and shops is even more of a fact. It is said that the current interest rate in Japan is only about two percent, and in Taiwan, it is only about six percent. Then, whether the current daily interest rate of one and a half or even two percent in this port is too high for the industrial and commercial sectors that have to compete with others, and whether it should be improved, really does not need to be discussed further. Have those adults and gentlemen who preside over the Four Banks, and the financial giants, not thought about this?

There are two main reasons for high prices: one is inflation, and the other is insufficient supply. These are the most obvious facts. As a result of tightening the money supply, many production enterprises have already been unable to sustain themselves; the supply of materials will inevitably gradually decrease in the future. Is this situation indirectly raising prices? This question should not be ignored!

Moreover, the rising trend of prices does not seem to be stopped or reversed by the tightening of the money supply. In the past few days, major commodities such as gold, US dollars, yarn, cloth, rice, wheat, flour, cooking oil, wool fabrics, and rayon have not been soaring again? On the one hand, the rising trend remains the same, and tightening the money supply does not have the slightest effect of curbing it. On the other hand, it forces industrial and commercial businesses to go bankrupt, indirectly promoting the rising trend. We believe that this approach has indeed reached the stage where it should "correct mistakes when known," and we must be careful not to stubbornly continue down the wrong path to the end, causing China's industrial and commercial businesses to be destroyed.

### Central Bank's Hundred-City Banknotes Still Accepted and Used as Usual

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] Recently, merchants and residents in this city have often mentioned that the Central Bank's 1,000-yuan and 500-yuan banknotes printed by the Southeast Provinces, Fujian Baida Printing Bureau, in the 34th year of the Republic of China, are not woodblock printed. However, due to wartime printing and limited materials, it is inevitable that they become blurred after prolonged use. The bank has always accepted and used these banknotes as usual. If certificate holders have old banknotes, they can send them to the bank for exchange at any time.

### US Military in Shanghai Dispatches Personnel to Chengdu to Rescue Lost Pilots

Will Use Helicopters in the Area

[United Press, This Port] Several members of an American B-29 flight were forced to land near the Burmese border two years ago and were captured by the Gulu tribe and used as slaves. They were recently discovered by church members in the area, who notified the US military in Chengdu, who in turn informed the US military in Shanghai. The US military authorities in Shanghai dispatched three representatives to Chengdu yesterday to contact the notifying church members. The representatives are expected to return to Shanghai tomorrow to report. According to those familiar with the customs of the Gulu tribe, the Gulu tribe will not release prisoners unless a ransom is paid. They will generally request food and salt in exchange. The US military authorities are willing to accept reasonable requests.

[United Press, Nanjing, 23rd] Colonel McConnell of the US Air Force Advisory Group in China stated today that the US Air Force in China has been ordered to do its best to rescue the American pilots who went missing in the Gulu area of western Sichuan. Any rescue organization wishing to set out to inquire about the whereabouts of the missing American pilots will be assisted by the Air Force Department under the group. According to McConnell, the mountain roads in the Gulu area are rugged and uneven, and the Gulu tribes are naturally wild. Rescue personnel have to use helicopters to facilitate search work.

### The Five Major Traitors, Zhou Fo-Hai, Ding Mo-Cun, and Luo Jun-Qiang, Were Officially Escorted and Transferred Yesterday. Zhou Fo-Hai Wore Black Gauze on His Arm, Seemingly Mourning for Wang Jing-Wei.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] The "escorting" procedures for the five major traitors, including Zhou Fo-Hai, were completed on the 23rd. At 12:30 noon, Prosecutor Chen Shengzu of the Capital High Court, accompanied by eight bailiffs, arrived at the detention center at 19 Ninghai Road in a large open car to handle the transfer procedures. First, Chen and Warden Zhang discussed everything in detail. At 2:30 PM, the bailiffs were ordered to set up posts at the entrance and on the roadside. Then, the luggage was moved onto the car. At 3:00 PM, the traitors filed out of the door one after another. Traitor Zhou led the way holding a cattail-leaf fan, followed by Traitor Luo and others. Each person was monitored by a bailiff. Then, because the car was slightly damaged, Traitor Zhou and others returned inside. After about ten minutes, Traitor Zhou boarded the car again. Traitors Zhou and Ding sat in the driver's seat, and the rest sat in the car compartment. When the five traitors left the door, they all lowered their hats to their shoulders to avoid being photographed. The clothing and attitudes of the traitors were as follows: Traitor Zhou wore a Prince coat, with black gauze wrapped around his left arm, seemingly mourning for Wang Jing-Wei, black leather-soled shoes, and a felt hat. Traitor Luo wore a gray striped short suit, yellow elastic-sided leather shoes, and a gray felt hat, with a cunning smile on his face. Traitor Ding wore a black felt hat, a blue cloth gown, black cloth-soled shoes, and held a small white package in his hand, his face pale, his expression dejected, and his eyes dull. Traitor Ma wore a dark blue striped fine wool gown, his attitude was stiff. The traitors carried a total of nine large packages, three leather suitcases, a large tin of biscuits, and two thermos bottles, totaling thirteen items. Yesterday, Traitor Ma's wife brought ten packages, and it was heard that there were also three leather suitcases and many other odd items. The prison authorities were afraid of criticism from others, so they temporarily left them behind. A quarter of an hour after Traitor Zhou left, Ma's wife, female caregiver, and maid came to visit and were very upset to hear that he had been escorted away. They immediately wanted to take the luggage away. The prison authorities agreed that they could pick it up tomorrow morning. After they left Ninghai Road, they went straight to the Capital District Court Detention Center at Laohuqiao. However, because the detention center was also overcrowded, they began interrogation and inspected the luggage at the same time, finishing only at night. It is reported that the five traitors were separately detained in cell numbers 4 and 6 of the Loyalty Ward. Warden Wan told reporters that they would enjoy the same treatment as ordinary prisoners and would not be allowed any special actions.

### Special Agent Traitor

Tian Chongguang Executed by Firing Squad in Hankou

[Li Bao, Hankou, 23rd] The notorious special agent traitor Tian Chongguang was recently executed by firing squad in Hankou. It is reported that this traitor had served in various puppet positions under Ye Daopeng. Then, he suddenly changed his identity and was appointed as the direct group leader of the Military Statistics Bureau's Hankou branch. In the 32nd year of the Republic of China, the traitor was detained by the enemy in Nanjing. The enemy, seeing his potential for exploitation, sent him to Tokyo, induced him to reveal work secrets, and used the Tokyo radio station to communicate with Chongqing, providing the enemy with great convenience in intelligence. After the victory, Tian Chongguang went to Chongqing and was detained by the Military Statistics Bureau and transferred to the Wuhan Military Headquarters Military Law Office for interrogation. Tian Chongguang was executed by firing squad in Hankou.

### President Roxas Sends Letter to Chairman Chiang Kai-Shek to Plead for Japanese War Criminal Shimpo

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd] Philippine President Roxas has sent a letter to Chairman Chiang Kai-Shek to plead for Major Shimpo, a Japanese war criminal currently detained in Jinan. When Roxas was under Japanese occupation in the Philippines, he was arrested by the Japanese side but was saved by Major Shimpo. The Philippine President sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang Kai-Shek to request leniency for Shimpo purely because some Japanese people who wanted to detain Shimpo had exerted their efforts. After a complicated process, they made Roxas aware of Shimpo's current situation. Roxas, in his condolence letter to Shimpo's wife, authorized his secretary to say: The President believes that Shimpo "risked his life to violate the order from his superiors to execute Roxas, and later continued to request a stay of execution."

It is heard that Li Dijun has been designated as the head of the comfort group, and the complete list of members will be determined soon.

### "Coolie" Chinese Laborers Return from Bangka

The Dutch Break Their Promise and Hastily Send Them Back

[Central News Agency, Singapore, 23rd] Before the war, from 1935 to 1941, there were more than 4,000 so-called "coolie" Chinese laborers on Bangka Island near Sumatra, who had accepted contracts from the Dutch government to work in the tin mines on Bangka Island. During the Japanese occupation, they suffered severe abuse, resulting in the death of more than half of them. Currently, because the contracts have expired, their situation is very dire and pitiful. They all wish to return to their home country. The Dutch have decided to send them back in batches. The first batch of 1,300 people left Bangka on the 21st of this month. One worker told reporters: According to the contract, the Dutch should provide all travel expenses for those who served for two years, as well as provide subsidies, a pair of shoes, and a hat. However, the Dutch broke their promise and only agreed to issue ten guilders per person when they arrive in Hong Kong. Whether the Dutch will keep their promise is doubtful. Overseas Chinese in the banking sector raised donations and distributed three and a half guilders to each person.

### Siamese Government Discusses Regulations on Overseas Chinese Entry

[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 23rd] Local newspapers report that Siamese Foreign Minister Chaiyanam and Interior Minister Ningke Rang jointly discussed the details of the proposed regulations on overseas Chinese entry yesterday. Since the arrival of our Ambassador Li Tiezheng in Bangkok, Siamese newspapers have published reports on the issue of overseas Chinese entry regulations. Overseas Chinese believe that this is a test to gauge Ambassador Li's attitude towards this issue. According to Ambassador Li, a few days ago, he told a Central News Agency reporter that he does not believe that the Siamese government will adopt regulations on the entry of overseas Chinese, because other countries have lifted or abolished entry restrictions as a gesture of friendship to China.

### National Health Campaign Propaganda Week Begins in Nanjing Yesterday

### New York Herald Tribune Editorial Refutes Zhou Enlai's Statement, Says Its Purpose is Purely for Propaganda

[Central News Agency, New York, 22nd] The New York Herald Tribune yesterday refuted Zhou Enlai's statement that US policy is undermining China's economy, saying that Zhou's remarks were purely for propaganda purposes and an attempt to damage the reputation of the United States. The newspaper's editorial, entitled "Mr. Zhou's Propaganda," reads as follows: The most absurd statement recently made in China is the statement by Zhou Enlai, who claimed that the policy of the United States is undermining the economy of China. The remarks made by Zhou, who is a Communist official, are obviously purely for propaganda purposes, and their purpose is obviously to undermine the reputation of the United States as much as possible. If Zhou could be concerned about the erroneous impression of China's economic situation, he could easily list its true causes. Just as everyone else has clearly observed, the reason is not mysterious at all. The first reason, and also the most important reason, is that the Chinese government has lost all its best sources of revenue while in office, so it has to rely on issuing banknotes to survive. This has caused terrible inflation. The second reason is that the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party has delayed economic recovery, part of which is due to the effective cutting of transportation lines by the Communist army. The third reason is that there are many inefficient or corrupt (or both) officials in the government. The fourth is that the Soviet Union destroyed or removed local industrial equipment in the Northeast. Zhou has blamed the United States for this, and his reason is that some American surplus materials flowed into the black market after being handed over to the Chinese government. If this is true, then this matter is not important except in Shanghai and most other cities. To say that China's suffering is due to the United States selling China the materials that its army and navy no longer use is a full display of its unreasonableness and senselessness.

Gui delivered a welcome speech, saying that Admiral Burke is a navigator who established great achievements in the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean during World War II. It is a great pleasure to be able to come to China this time. The relationship between China and Britain has always been harmonious. General Fraser has given much help to our navy in the past, such as the training of our naval officers and soldiers, which is almost the same as the training in England. This is all due to the efforts of cooperation and mutual understanding between the two sides. The General and his party will stay in Beijing for a short time and will leave Beijing tomorrow. It is hoped that during this period, they can be made as convenient and comfortable as possible. Let us raise our glasses to the health of the British Emperor, to the prosperity of the British Navy, and to the health of General Burke. Next, Admiral Burke delivered a reply speech, first expressing his gratitude, and stated that the Central Navy will be able to become more and more intimate under the principles of cooperation and mutual understanding.

### Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference Reopens, Bevin Meets with Molotov Yesterday to Discuss the Issue of Italy's Former Territories at the Peace Conference

[This Newspaper Report] London, 23rd, Broadcast: British Foreign Secretary Bevin met with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov this afternoon, and then met with Bidault to discuss the convening of a Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference. According to the British Broadcasting Corporation, the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference will be convened within 24 hours.

In addition, the Four-Power Foreign Ministers issued a declaration today, agreeing to hand over the issue of Italy's African colonies to the United Nations General Assembly for a decision.

[This Newspaper Report] Paris, 23rd, Broadcast: The main part of the Italian peace treaty began to be discussed in the meeting this morning, which is Article 17 of the treaty, the issue of Italy's former colonies. The original draft of the four powers contained three points: (1) Italy should renounce its rights to its former colonies; (2) the existing government authorities, namely the "British and French military government," should continue until the fate of these colonies is truly resolved; (3) the four powers are scheduled to decide on the fate of Italy's former colonies within a year after the signing of the Italian peace treaty. Representatives of various countries then successively expressed their opinions. Italian representative Bonomi said that Italians have historical actions in Africa, and there are now more than 100,000 Italians living in various territories, forming the basis of the economic foundation of these territories. Italians cannot renounce these colonies without any legal guarantee. Bonomi then expressed his gratitude to the Soviet and French ministers for their previous suggestions to the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference to change the political system of Italy's former colonies into a trusteeship system! He also requested that Italian groups still be allowed to continue to participate in the work of their African colonial governments. Representatives from Egypt and Abyssinia requested the return of Istria, and Egypt also requested the Garbousa source of Libya and the Solon Plateau of Libya. The Egyptian representative also proposed that Libya be governed jointly with the member states of the Arab League. Abyssinia stated that it was willing to temporarily give up Somalia, a former Italian colony, but reserved the right to express its position on this issue in the future. The Brazilian representative supported the suggestion of entrusting the former Italian colonies to trusteeship, but this will become an amendment to Article 17 of the peace treaty. New Zealand requested that the fate of the Italian territories not be determined only by the four powers, but should be decided by the United Nations.

### Harriman Appointed US Secretary of Commerce, Expresses Absolute Support for Byrnes

[Reuters, Washington, 23rd] President Truman announced today that he has appointed Harriman as Secretary of Commerce to succeed Wallace, who resigned.

[This Newspaper Report] London, 23rd, Broadcast: Newly appointed US Secretary of Commerce Harriman issued a statement today, saying that the development of US trade depends on the cooperation and peace of various countries in the world, and expressed absolute support for Truman and Byrnes' foreign policy.

[United Press, United States, Mia, 22nd] Railroad Employees Friendship Association Chairman Weidnan told reporters today that the political ideology led by Senator Pepper and former Secretary of Commerce Wallace can get great assistance from labor. Calling it Pepper-Wallaceism or Wallace-Pepperism is really irrelevant. Ninety-nine percent of railroad employees and the majority of all workers support this ideology, and Miners Union Chairman Lewis will also assist. Wade is not interested in organizing a third party because it has no hope of winning. What is needed now is to restore President Roosevelt's basic principles of freedom and progress.

### Iranian Rebels Capture Cities

Government Resolves to Take Strong Action

[Reuters, Tehran, 23rd] Arab tribes have surrounded the port of Bushehr on the Persian Gulf coast, and three places between Bushehr and Shiraz have also been occupied by armed Qazi tribes. The Iranian government has announced that it will take strong action against the rebels.

### Switzerland Restores Diplomatic Relations with the Soviet Union and Reaffirms its Foreign Policy

[Agence France-Presse, Zurich, 22nd] Swiss Foreign Minister Petitpierre recently delivered a speech at the third meeting of the Women's Congress, in which he discussed the arrival of Soviet diplomatic envoys in Switzerland. He said that the restoration of diplomatic relations between Switzerland and the Soviet Union is not the highest point, but the beginning of permanent friendship between the two countries. Our ideas about democracy and the relationship between individuals and the country are different, but we all want to know the way of life of the Soviet people. Regarding the agreement between Switzerland and the United States on German property, the turbulent and uncertain future of Germany is almost one of the anxious factors in the general political situation. The current international situation is quite serious, and large and small countries are attacking each other, using terms that have never been used in diplomacy before, but I believe that the controversy will eventually be overcome, there is no doubt. The world has high hopes for the United Nations Charter, but unfortunately it has failed to live up to the world's expectations. Even if the war industries of ten countries continue to produce as usual, it will create very dangerous rumors that the so-called Third World War is inevitable. Fortunately, we still maintain an optimistic attitude and are not attacked by the deterioration of fear. In terms of Switzerland's neutral status, the United Nations Charter must impose the obligations assumed by the United Nations member states on our country, but our country is in a neutral position and it is difficult to fulfill it. Therefore, no one knows when Switzerland will be able to join the United Nations organization, but there is also a possibility that it can be realized in the shortest possible time. The meeting site of the United Nations Women's Organization may use the former League of Nations headquarters in Geneva.

### Bose is Not Dead!

[Reuters, Bombay, 23rd] According to reports received here, astonishing news may be announced within a few weeks: Chiang-te-la Bose, the founder of the "Indian National Army," has safely returned to somewhere in India. Bose's All-India Forward Bloc party is said to be prepared to announce that Bose will appear before October. Bose is still admired by countless Indians. Now, the interim government of India has announced the cancellation of the warrant for Bose's arrest. Therefore, if Bose is still alive and reappears, it would be harmless. According to the news of Bose's death in a plane crash, it was originally issued by a Japanese news agency last year. At that time, although the news agency published photos of the wreckage of the plane and the funeral situation, and the passengers on the same plane described Bose's death, many people still believed that Bose did not die, but hid again as before, waiting for an opportunity to move again. This leader, who once had disputes with the highest authorities of the Congress Party, gained the worship of the Indian people during the war. It is expected that if he reappears, his reputation and status will be second only to Gandhi.

[Report from this newspaper] London, 23rd broadcast: Bloody terror in India broke out again in Calcutta today, with a total of thirty people stabbed, injured, and killed. The curfew, which was originally scheduled to be lifted tomorrow, has been decided to be extended for another week.

### The United States Helps Japan Restore Its Industrial Economy; Japan's Cocoon Transport to China is Rejected; MacArthur's Textile Advisor Issues Statement

[United Press, Tokyo, 23rd] MacArthur's headquarters textile advisor, Magner, today accused Song Ziwen, President of the Executive Yuan of China, and stated that he opposed any silkworm cocoons being transported to China. The Chinese delegation to Japan had requested that 1.5 million pounds of Japanese silkworm cocoons be transported to China, but was rejected by MacArthur's headquarters. Recently, it has expressed dissatisfaction and indirectly accused American capitalists of attempting to monopolize Japan's silk industry, thus arousing Magner's backlash. According to Magner, the main source of Japan's occupation costs paid to the Allied forces comes from Japan's silk weaving industry, so the plan was not fulfilled as desired. Chinese silk factories purchased a large batch of poor-quality silkworm cocoons in China at the beginning of this year, believing that the silk made from these cocoons could be sold at high prices in the United States or international markets. The Chinese side is attempting to obtain better Japanese silkworm cocoons at low prices in order to offset the money it spent on purchasing silkworm cocoons in its own country before. Japan is in need of all its silkworm cocoons to maintain silk exports. Some Japanese silk factories are currently being urged to switch to manufacturing cotton and rayon fabrics, which is also for this reason. It has now been ordered that the Japanese expand mulberry fields in order to increase the number of silkworm cocoons, so that annual silk exports can reach 30 million pounds. Before the war, Japan exported 95 million pounds of raw silk annually. China currently has silkworm cocoons that can produce 20,000 bales of raw silk annually, but China has not yet achieved this. The Chinese delegation's request to transport Japanese silkworm cocoons to China came from a direct request from a Chinese silk company to the delegation. American businessmen have never used the government to ask MacArthur's headquarters to obtain Japanese export commodities for them. Any silkworm cocoons transported to China will make the Japanese economy even more at a loss. Therefore, transporting Japanese silkworm cocoons to China would violate the Potsdam Declaration and would not be in line with the purpose of occupying Japan.

[United Press, Washington, 22nd] The US government's assistance to Japan in restoring its industrial economy is steadily progressing. This matter is being carried out in cooperation with the State Department, the Department of the Army, and other government agencies, with the aim of restoring Japan's economic status as soon as possible, at least to the point of being self-sufficient, and with the help of experts, to pay for the occupation costs of the United Nations. Japan's textile industry, cotton yarn industry, and rayon industry have all received strong assistance. The US government purchases all the raw silk that Japan can produce, and will provide more assistance to its rayon industry to revive it. For several months, it has continuously imported raw cotton into Japan and provided funds to purchase foreign goods that Japan urgently needs. However, Japan's re-entry into the cotton fabric export market has not been unanimously approved by the United Nations. In the Far East, India needs cotton fabrics, and Japanese yarn factories are willing to supply them. However, China, Britain, and other producers all hope to restore their pre-war businesses. According to the views of the American authorities, although this matter is opposed by all parties, it will continue to provide large-scale assistance to the Japanese textile industry.

Japanese Cotton Cloth Production Capacity Estimated

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 21st] A recent report from the US military government in the Japanese occupied zone announced that an agreement has been established between the Japanese textile industry, the Bank of Japan, and the Ministry of Finance to establish a banking group to fund the activities of the cotton weaving industry. Before the war, Japan sold more than 3 million yards of cotton cloth annually in the world market. It is expected that by the end of this year, Japan will resume exports, most of which will be cotton fabrics, raw silk, and cotton yarn spun from American cotton. The Commodity Credit Corporation, a US government agency, will supply Japan with 890,000 bales of cotton this year, of which 185,384 bales have already been shipped. All of this cotton will be woven into cotton fabrics for export. Eighty percent of Japanese spindles were destroyed due to the war, which greatly reduced cotton cloth production. However, it is expected that production capacity can be doubled by the end of 1947. The production of cotton yarn is limited due to the lack of coal and chemicals, but the production of yarn pulp has greatly increased. This year's raw silk production is approximately 150 million yards, but only 30 million yards are prepared for export. Japanese silk exporters expect that within five years, Japan's raw silk exports can regain its leading position in the world market. It is heard that the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union are all willing to encourage the revival of Japan's textile exports for different reasons. The United States hopes that Japan will use textile exports to pay for imported food and occupation costs. Britain needs Japan to supply cotton fabrics to its colonies. The Soviet Union hopes to obtain Japanese textiles under a barter system. Therefore, the Japanese textile industry has a thriving appearance.

Direct Trade is Currently Difficult to Approve

[United Press, Tokyo, 23rd] Peter Kroll, head of the Economic Science Group of the Foreign Trade Division of MacArthur's headquarters, said that the Japan Trade Promotion Association recently sent a letter to the Trade Bureau, advocating changing the procedures for Japan's import and export trade, and implementing barter trade between manufacturers and various countries in the Far East. It is feared that it will not be approved by MacArthur. The dispatch of a Japanese observation group to foreign countries to investigate the international market situation may not be allowed, and even the free exchange of information on international market trends may not be allowed. MacArthur's headquarters is currently using the Japan Trade Bureau to monitor Japan's export trade and intends to continue monitoring it in order to benefit the Japanese economy and at the same time supply various scarce items to other parts of the world. According to Kroll, Japanese businessmen often mention direct trade, but the time is not yet ripe for Japan to manage international trade on its own. The headquarters is currently conducting personnel research, and may eventually allow some commercial relations with various countries, but it is still a long way off. The headquarters is currently implementing barter trade with various countries.

### Japanese Upper House Passes Bill to Implement Social Welfare System

An Unprecedented Move in Japanese History

[Reuters, Tokyo, 22nd] The Japanese Upper House passed the "Daily Life Safety Law," which stipulates the establishment of protection and relief associations in various cities to assist the unemployed, the poor and sick, maternity women, distribute pensions, and other various relief work. This bill was promoted by the Allied forces and is an unprecedented move in Japanese history. Japan has never seen a social welfare system in its history. The passage of this bill indicates that the Japanese government has assumed responsibility for social welfare.

### Japan Once Reared White Russian Spies Plot to Assassinate Stalin Far East Court Reveals Truth about Axis Alliance

[Report from this newspaper] San Francisco, 23rd broadcast: A surprising discovery was made in today's trial of Japanese war criminals. The American side presented Nazi secret documents proving that Oshima, the former Japanese ambassador to Germany, had carried out a conspiracy to assassinate Stalin, but was unsuccessful. It is said that Oshima had sent ten White Russian spies across the Caucasus border with bombs to kill Stalin, but it was unsuccessful.

[Remodeling Society, Tokyo, 23rd] Prosecutors at the Far East International Military Tribunal today continued to present various documents to reveal the truth about Axis diplomacy. As a result of the meeting between Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and Japanese Ambassador to Italy Shiratori in 1939, Prime Minister Hiranuma approved the German-Italian-Japanese alliance, Foreign Minister Arita was lukewarm, and Shiratori was very supportive. As a result, there were many reservations, and the alliance was limited to an anti-Soviet alliance. Oshima and Shiratori refused to convey this Japanese instruction to Germany and Italy, and hoped that Japan would fully accept the alliance plan. The German Ambassador to Japan, Walter, reported to his government that the Japanese Minister of the Army and the Minister of Finance supported the Tripartite Pact, while the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of the Navy expressed opposition. The Army was trying to establish the alliance, and if it failed, it would withdraw from the cabinet, while the Navy, led by Navy Vice Minister Yamamoto, expressed opposition. After Germany and the Soviet Union signed a non-aggression treaty, negotiations on the Tripartite Pact should be stopped, and it was said that the non-aggression treaty violated the Anti-Comintern Pact, but Oshima did not consider the protest insignificant and submitted the protest to the German government. In 1940, German Ambassador to Japan Stahmer reported to his government that he had obtained the assistance of Oshima, Shiratori, Terauchi, and Ishii, and that the pro-German elements in the Army, who had temporarily retreated, were planning to regain their power. Later, he telegraphed that although the Yonai cabinet was pro-British and pro-American, it was opposed by the Army and the people, so its policies could not be implemented. He had met with Konoe, Mimura, and others to incite anti-American sentiment in Japan. He is currently working to reconcile Japan and the Soviet Union, hoping that Konoe will become prime minister.

### Gandhi's Birthday Celebrated by People in All Provinces

### Korean Autonomous Government to Be Established in March Next Year

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] The Korean Provisional Government delegation in China received a Korean broadcast message stating that the US military government in Seoul announced that it would decide to organize a Korean autonomous government in March next year. Currently, Korean personnel are organizing a legislative body to draft a charter in preparation for organizing the government. The Legislative Organization Committee will be co-organized by thirty officials appointed by the government and thirty people elected by the public. Once the work is completed, thirty people appointed by the government will be re-elected by the public. After the Korean autonomous government is established, the military government will be abolished, and an advisory group will be formed to assist it. Although the Soviet side has not participated in the organization of the Korean government, the US side is still working hard to consult with the Soviet side in order to realize the promise of Korean unification and complete independence.

### Japanese Zaibatsu's Young Daughter Kidnapped Case Solved

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 23rd] Sumitomo Kokuko, the eleven-year-old daughter of Japanese tycoon Sumitomo Kichizaemon, was kidnapped on September 17. After seven days of searching, police authorities arrested the kidnapper in a village in central Japan today, and the hostage is safe and sound. According to police authorities, the kidnapper is named Gokuguchi Yoshio, 22 years old, and is a repeat offender. He once kidnapped a 12-year-old girl, who was redeemed by her family for 15,000 yen. Therefore, the clues in this case led to the cracking of the case.

### Modern "Tarzan" Grows Up Among Antelope Herds Runs Like the Wind Does Not Know Human Language Makes Sheep Sounds Eats Grass

[Reuters, Baghdad, 22nd] The antelope man recently discovered in the Outer Jordanian desert is now being carefully taken care of by Gilbert of the Iraqi Oil Company. According to Gilbert, when this strange man of fifteen was captured, he ran at a speed of 50 miles per hour, which is more than twice the world record for the 100-yard dash. This modern "Tarzan" was probably abandoned by his mother when he was young and adopted by a herd of antelope, gradually learning various characteristics of the antelope. I have studied him in detail and found that his actions, cries, and sounds are all like those of antelope. He only wants to eat grass and does not want to eat ordinary food. But I am sure that he is human, but he grew up in an antelope herd. When he was first discovered by a person hunting antelope, he almost lost his life. Fortunately, a person in the shadows saw a child in the herd of sheep and immediately told his companions not to shoot. He then drove a car to chase, and the child ran at a speed of 50 miles per hour. Finally, he collapsed to the ground due to exhaustion. According to the Ruwala tribal chief who first took care of the child, on the first day the child was in his home, he jumped onto the roof and then jumped from one roof to another. Later, he jumped into the street, and finally, he sent out horses and carriages to chase and capture him after more than two hours. When the child was first discovered, there were many rumors, saying that he was half-human and half-sheep. Now we know that the child is indeed human, only more robust than ordinary people. Of course, he cannot speak human language, he can only make antelope sounds. It is said that he has recently become accustomed to human life. It is said that mothers of nomadic peoples in the Near East often abandon their children in animal herds, but most of them are eaten by animals. As for those who are raised by animals, there are very few.

### The Riddle of the Middle East (Part 1)

—Original by Braidy, translated by Wenhao Jie

On the international stage, the Middle East is about to show its skills again. Here, Britain and Russia are opposed to each other, the United States stands on the side of Britain, and other countries are also eager to step onto the stage. It has recently acted as a mediator several times. As for the people of the Middle East, not long ago, they were bought out and had no idea about the plot of the play. But now the situation is different. The representatives of the people, whether real or fake, often occupy a considerable position on this stage. The key to the Middle East is in the hands of Britain and Russia. Britain is deeply afraid that Russia's encouragement of leftists in the Near East countries will threaten the lifeline of the British Empire. Conversely, Russia is deeply worried that Britain will use reactionary forces to create governments and make things difficult for it.

Difficulties are brewing everywhere in the Middle East. The factors can be roughly divided into three categories: the conflict of interests between Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union; in the past thirty years, a high degree of nationalism has deeply gripped Islam; due to frequent contact with the West during World War II, a kind of social awakening has been created, and this awakening has been accelerated by the socialism brought by Russia.

Since the birth of civilization, geography and history have bestowed the Middle East with supreme strategic importance, because it is a bridge and a transverse road between many continents. It is part of Asia and also the only way for Westerners to come to the East. It contains the world's richest oil fields and many other undeveloped resources. The three powers are very clear: any country that alone controls the Middle East will eventually be able to control Asia and its 1.2 billion people, which is almost half of the world's population.

Turkey and the Straits

The powers are deeply afraid that Russia's influence will enter the Mediterranean through the Dardanelles Strait and the Black Sea, and the Persian Gulf through Iran. Britain believes that this kind of invasion is very unfavorable. In order to resist this kind of invasion, Britain often asks Russia to respect the territorial and political integrity of Turkey and Iran in the same way. With the support of the United States, Britain has gained greater trust from the conservative Turkish and Iranian governments. Conversely, Russia is also propagating that Britain and the United States want to control the entire politics and economy of the Middle East. Russia believes that it is not only excluded from the Middle East oil fields, but also faces effective walls everywhere for the naval and air bases it needs to resist the British military encirclement formed there. In today's collapse of the French and Italian navies, the Mediterranean has become a British lake. The Soviet Union has been demanding its rights over the Dardanelles. If the Dardanelles fall into the hands of Russia, Britain will not be able to stop the pro-Russian party in Greece from seizing power. Therefore, Turkey and Greece, like Greece, form a key part of British foreign policy.

The Iranian Incident

Iran also lies on the lifeline of the British Empire. The coastline of Iran forms the entire eastern part of the Persian Gulf. Iraq, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia are located in its northern and western regions. As early as 1914, Kuwait became an independent principality under British protection. At the same time, the King of Saudi Arabia has maintained friendly relations with Britain since taking power. According to the exclusive agreement signed in March 1892, these principalities, their monarchs themselves, and their heirs shall not enter into agreements or dealings with countries other than Britain, nor shall they accept envoys from any country other than Britain, nor shall they cede or sell any land to countries other than Britain.

Therefore, by means of these treaties, Britain fully grasped strategic advantages in the Persian Gulf. Any power that occupies a place in southern Iran can interfere with Britain's transportation lines in the Arabian Sea. It can advance eastward and knock on the door of North India. The reason why the Russian army entered Iran after March 2 this year, and Britain roared in the United Nations Security Council, lies in this.

### City Government Budget Deficit of 22.1 Billion Yuan Approved; Decision to Open New Revenue Sources to Compensate, Imposing a Municipal Construction Surtax; Assembly Postponed Again; Horse Racing Issue to be Discussed Today

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Municipal Council held its 21st meeting yesterday morning. First, a commemoration week was held, with Speaker Pan Gongzhan delivering a speech: Although the city government budget began to be discussed last Saturday, and several resolutions have already been made, there is no overall decision on the entire budget. Therefore, the first item on today's agenda is to decide on the budget. At the same time, it is hoped that in the morning meeting, the cases related to the budget and the additional tax levies will be discussed and decided based on the review reports, so as to make up for the budget deficit. If we only pass the budget without deciding on the compensation method, then the passed budget will still be nominal. Secondly, only half of the review reports of the various committees of the council have been discussed. If they cannot be discussed and completed in today's (that is, yesterday's) extended agenda, the assembly may be postponed for one or two days. Finally, Pan hoped that all councilors can consistently adhere to the spirit of not being late and not asking for leave during this assembly, so as not to affect the meeting and to be responsible to the voters. According to Pan's report, the number of councilors attending the first few days of the assembly was more than 150, while later attendees were only about 110 to 120.

The assembly discussed the mayor's proposed tax levies in the morning. After discussion and resolution, the additional clothing fees for the security corps and epidemic prevention expenses attached to the house tax were cancelled, reducing the total deficit by 1.8 billion yuan. When merged into the budget revenue, the total revenue and expenditure deficit reached 22.1 billion yuan. As for the source of revenue, the entertainment tax was still raised to 50% collection, but the levy of a sanitation fee was rejected. At the same time, it was passed to levy a surcharge on public utilities (excluding water bills), which could bring in 4 billion yuan for half a year. The house tax is levied at 20% of the actual rent, borne by the landlord. In the afternoon, the issue of who should bear the municipal tax was discussed, and the situation was quite heated. It was resolved that the municipal tax should be borne by the residents according to the house tax collection method.

Finally, the assembly passed the organizational rules for various committees of the Municipal Council. Each committee shall have one chairman and two vice-chairmen, who shall be elected by the committee members. The chairman shall not concurrently serve as the head of a labor union. The term of office is three months, and a re-election shall be held after each assembly adjournment. Each councilor shall participate in at least one committee and at most two. Each committee shall meet once every two weeks, and special meetings may be convened by the chairman when necessary.

In addition, because the assembly had many proposals to discuss, it was decided to extend the session until today. Today's agenda will discuss social, educational, public works, legal, and "horse racing" issues, and will also pass the assembly declaration.

Revenue and Expenditure Deficit! How to Compensate?

Two Focuses of Discussion

In the morning session, the municipal budget for the second half of the year continued to be discussed, with the focus on: (1) How much should the revenue and expenditure deficit be determined to be? (2) What new tax rules should be adopted to compensate for this deficit?

Before determining the deficit figure, several questions were raised regarding certain existing tax systems and city government revenue items:

Travelers Should Fulfill Their Tax Obligations

Wu Zhengzhuan first raised whether the hotel tax of more than 200 million yuan listed in the budget was reasonable. Gu Chunfan, director of the Finance Bureau, immediately explained that travelers to Shanghai also enjoy Shanghai's municipal facilities, so they should naturally fulfill a portion of their tax obligations.

The speaker explained that the temporary council had already decided to levy the hotel tax, so there was no need to discuss it again. However, Jin Runxiang and others raised it again, and the speaker put it to a vote, which resulted in only a very small number of people supporting the cancellation.

Zhang Xuelian asked whether the city government's revenue from the sale of materials, 4 billion yuan, and the revenue from various public utilities were included in the budget. Sun Yunfeng asked whether the materials received by the municipal government's Materials Reception and Management Office were also included in the budget. Regarding these points, the mayor immediately stood up to reply that more than 90% of the 4 billion yuan from the sale of materials had been used in the first half of the year for the living subsidies of civil servants. Regarding public property, most of the property rights involved foreign affairs issues, which are still awaiting the designation of a management committee by the Executive Yuan to resolve. As for the received materials, they will be included in the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Office in the future, so they cannot be listed as budget items.

Cancelling the House Tax Surcharge Increases the Budget Deficit

Xu Yongzuo pointed out that the previous assembly had resolved to cancel the security corps clothing fees in the house tax, but the entertainment tax originally also included this clothing fee, with a monthly revenue of 400 million yuan. If the levy is stopped from September, the deficit will increase by 1.6 billion yuan. If the collected fees for July and August also need to be refunded, the increased deficit will be 2.4 billion yuan.

Director Gu explained again regarding this issue that the security corps clothing fees attached to the house tax were listed separately under the "temporary receipts" account, but the clothing fees attached to the entertainment tax have never been separated and are all collected and spent together. If it is cancelled, there will be difficulties. In fact, the dispute over the entertainment tax is not about whether there is a clothing fee attached to it, but about the percentage of the tax rate. Entertainment businesses have repeatedly requested a reduction in the tax rate in the past month. What the council needs to decide now is whether to maintain the current tax rate, which is 40% of the ticket price, or to reduce it back to the previous 30%. However, in any case, if the deficit increases due to a reduction in the tax rate, it will still need to be raised from the citizens. Therefore, he believes that it is better to collect more from those who have extra money to enjoy entertainment!

The speaker read out the central government's regulations on the entertainment tax on banquets and entertainment, which stipulates that the entertainment tax should not exceed 50% of the ticket price. Therefore, he said: "The current budget only lists 40% of the ticket price, which does not exceed the regulations. If it is reduced, the burden will be universally increased for all citizens, which is wrong! It should be borne by those who have the ability to enjoy entertainment!" Yan Kuasheng suggested that the fine item in the budget could be increased by 300 million yuan, but Feng Youzhen opposed it, believing that there must be violations before there can be fines. If the specified amount is too high, there may be cases of arbitrary fines in the future.

Deficit of 22.1 Billion Yuan Approved by 110 Votes

The discussion of the details had taken up a lot of time, and the speaker finally decided to put the fundamental principle, the determination of the revenue and expenditure deficit, to a vote. The original budget compiled by the city government had a deficit of 33.3 billion yuan. After the ninth group reviewed it, adding what should be added and subtracting what should be subtracted, the verified revenue was more than 55.1 billion yuan, and the expenditure was more than 75.4 billion yuan, resulting in a deficit of 20.3 billion yuan. However, because the previous assembly resolved to cancel the security corps clothing fees and epidemic prevention expenses attached to the house tax, totaling 1.8 billion yuan, the revenue was reduced, and the deficit increased to 22.1 billion yuan. If this number is approved, a method of opening up revenue sources must be planned to compensate for it. Do the councilors agree? As a result of the vote, 110 of the 119 people present raised their hands in favor, and the principle was approved.

Three Methods for Opening Up Revenue Sources: Changing the House Tax to be Borne by Landlords, Increasing the Entertainment Tax to 50%, and Levying an Additional Tax on Public Utilities

After the deficit of 22.1 billion yuan was determined by a vote, the assembly discussed how to open up revenue sources to compensate for it. Among the five methods submitted by the mayor, except for the horse racing tax, which will be discussed separately, the review groups believed that the municipal tax and the public utility surcharge should be adopted.

According to the report by Lu Shidao, convener of the third group, the review process was based on three principles: (1) Avoid making citizens feel that there are excessive and miscellaneous taxes, (2) The tax standard should be proportional to wealth, (3) Collection should be simple to prevent loopholes. After discussion, it was felt that raising the house tax, although easier for citizens to accept, was clearly in conflict with central government regulations and might affect rent increases. The sanitation fee felt too meticulous. The public utility surcharge was the most fair and reasonable, and the easiest to collect, but the amount was too small. Although the municipal tax collection procedure was troublesome, it was more in line with the principle of fairness. Therefore, it was initially decided to adopt the municipal tax method, but after it was passed, someone proposed a reconsideration at the group meeting. As a result of the reconsideration, although the original decision was maintained, the number of votes in favor and against differed by only one vote. Later, private parties suggested using the name "municipal construction surtax," which includes the 4 billion yuan public utility surcharge, with the remaining deficit of more than 18 billion yuan to be collected by the Finance Bureau at a tax rate at its discretion, based on the current house tax ratio.

After Lu's report, the councilors expressed their opinions one after another, and the discussion was very intense. The important points are as follows:

(1) Regarding the public utility surcharge, some people believed that the water bill should not be levied because water is necessary for any commoner. Some people believe that the levy of electricity bills should take into account the situation of the industrial sector, because factories use the most electricity, especially yarn factories, and the fees are higher. Therefore, if it is desired to cultivate industry, the levy of electricity bills should be considered.

The Name is Not Proper, the Words Are Not Correct

(2) The most important thing is the opposition to the name "municipal tax." Tong Xingbai believed that the municipal tax is actually a property tax, levied according to the value of real estate, which is in line with the Three People's Principles of controlling capital. However, the name "municipal tax" is too vague, and he advocated changing it to a property tax. He said: "I hope that future taxes will be concentrated on real estate and property, and that we don't need to scrape the common people piecemeal!" But the speaker pointed out that the municipal tax is levied on residents, not owners. Therefore, if you want to levy a property tax, that is another matter and cannot be combined with the municipal tax. Wang Jian'e pointed out that in the era of the former Public Works Bureau, the house tax was called the municipal tax. Now that there is a house tax, if you collect a municipal tax again, it will give citizens a bad impression. He advocated changing it to a municipal construction surtax. Many people who spoke afterwards mostly believed that the name "property tax" was not true to its name and might lead to an increase in rent. It is better to use "municipal construction surtax."

(3) Chen Gongda proposed another method of opening up revenue sources. He believed that since the law stipulates that the entertainment tax can be up to 50%, the current rate is only 40%, and it can be increased by another 10%. In this way, the tax revenue can be increased by 800 million to 1 billion yuan in the three months from October to the end of December.

(4) Xu Yongzuo proposed that since the security corps clothing fees and epidemic prevention expenses have been removed from the house tax and the levy reduced, the method of bearing the burden should be improved. According to the central government regulations, 30% should be levied on the actual rental amount, borne by the landlord.

Passing Three Important Resolutions

After several tens of minutes of discussion, various opinions were summarized and put to a vote. Finally, three important resolutions were passed: First, the entertainment tax rate was increased to 50%. Second, the house tax was changed to 20% of the actual rental amount, borne by the landlord. Third, an additional public utility surcharge was levied. For the number that is still insufficient, the municipal government will use the name "municipal construction surtax" to make up for it at its discretion.

Finally, the discussion turned to the collection method of the municipal construction surtax. Should it be borne by the landlord? Or should it be borne by the tenant? Or should it be borne jointly by the landlord and tenant?

Opinions were clearly divided into three factions: One faction believed that the landlord should bear more of the burden. Their argument was that since the landlord owns real estate, he is naturally a wealthy class, and the wealthy should pay more taxes! One faction believed that the municipal construction surtax, as the name implies, is for municipal construction. According to the principle of equal rights and obligations, it should be borne by those who enjoy the benefits. Now that it has been resolved that the house tax should be borne by the landlord, the municipal construction surtax should be borne by the tenant. The compromise faction in the middle of these two factions advocated setting a ratio for the landlord and tenant to bear it fairly.

The debate was fierce, and the meeting was extended to 12:45 PM without a result. Finally, Xi Yushu suggested that the discussion be left to the afternoon, when specific figures could be studied before making a decision.

### Attendees at the Assembly Are Not Responsible for External Statements; Clarification on the Appropriation of Temples

[Report from Our Newspaper] Since the Council passed Review Report No. 3 on the People's Livelihood a few days ago, resolving to "appropriate or borrow temples or public buildings" for the use of district offices, the Council has received many petitions from various temples and Buddhist associations.

Yesterday afternoon, Speaker Pan solemnly stated two points at the assembly:

(1) According to Article 18 of the Council's Organizational Regulations, attendees and those present at the meeting are responsible to the Council for their statements, but are not responsible for external statements.

(2) Regarding the Council's Review Report No. 3 on the People's Livelihood, which resolved to appropriate or borrow temples or public buildings for the use of district offices, the so-called appropriation was carefully considered. Temples that belong to the local public or public managers, and those that are currently abandoned, can naturally be appropriated. As for general temples, their consent should be obtained first before borrowing them, in order to protect the property rights of the temples and to ensure that the district offices can solve everything. All appropriation or borrowing procedures should be carried out in accordance with the provisions of the law, without any doubt.

### Citizens Report Temples Monks for Aiding the Enemy, the Assembly Agreed to Transfer to the Court for Handling; Clarification on the Appropriation of Temples

[Report from Our Newspaper] Merchants of this city Xie Xiqing, Cai Jianquan, Lu Zhonghou, Zhou Yinquan, witnesses Chen Zhixin, Yao Shaoxiu, and Xu Honghan, have jointly reported Abbot Dewu and resident monk Miqia of Jing'an Temple for the crime of communicating with and aiding the enemy, and have filed a lawsuit with the High Procuratorate. Although the court has held two hearings, the defendants have been released on bail. Now, two months have passed, and there is still no news of prosecution. Yesterday, Yao Shaoxiu also brought evidence of the recruitment of students by the Buddhist Tongming School run by the defendant (see picture) to the Council, requesting that justice be served and that a public decision be made. Councilor Gong received them and reported to the assembly, saying: Many citizens have listed three major crimes committed by the monks Dewu and Miqia of Jing'an Temple. The most obvious point is the establishment of the Tongming Japanese Language School for enslavement education. They have reported and sued them to the High Procuratorate. Although the court has held hearings, the wanted criminals are still at large. Therefore, in response to the Council's deadline for reporting traitors, they have come to make a statement. After a decision by the assembly, this case will be transferred to the court for handling.

### Discussing the Municipal Construction Surtax; Resolution that it Should be Borne by Residents

Yesterday afternoon, the Municipal Council continued to discuss the issue of who should bear the municipal construction surtax. The councilors engaged in an unprecedentedly heated debate on whether it should be borne by the tenants or jointly by the landlords and tenants, and many based their arguments on actual figures.

The final resolution passed was: "(1) The municipal construction surtax should be collected in accordance with the method of Proposal No. 2 on the Father's Day. Of the total amount, except for the house tax levied at 20% of the actual rent, which should be borne by the landlord, the remaining amount will be the surtax rate, which is divided into three classes based on the current value of the house. Class A: houses with a current value of 100 million yuan or more will be charged a monthly tax of 3/1000. Class B: houses with a current value of 50 million yuan or more but less than 100 million yuan will be charged a monthly tax of 2/1000. Class C: houses with a current value of less than 50 million yuan will be charged a monthly tax of 1/1000.

Xu Yongzuo Reports that Landlords Cannot Afford It

Based on the above tax rates, Xu Yongzuo gave a report with figures. He used the rent of the 26th year of the Republic as a standard and divided it into three classes, A, B, and C. He explained that if the municipal construction surtax were to be borne by the landlord, the landlord would be unable to afford it. Assuming that the monthly rent for a Class A house in the 26th year of the Republic was 500 yuan, calculated at the statutory 160 times, the current rent is 80,000 yuan. After deducting the 20% house tax of 16,000 yuan, the net income is 64,000 yuan. The value of this type of house in the 26th year of the Republic was 50,000 yuan, calculated at 5,000 times, the current value is 250 million yuan. The municipal construction surtax at 3/1000 is 750,000 yuan. In addition to the net income of 64,000 yuan in rent, the landlord would lose 686,000 yuan. Even if the landlord and tenant each bear half, the landlord would still lose 311,000 yuan. For a Class B house, assuming the pre-war rent was 100 yuan, the current rent is 16,000 yuan. After deducting the 3,200 yuan house tax, the net income is 12,800 yuan. The current value is 50 million yuan, and the municipal construction surtax needs to be paid at 2/1000, which is 100,000 yuan. The landlord would lose 87,200 yuan. If the landlord and tenant bear it equally, the landlord would also lose 27,200 yuan. For a Class C house, assuming the pre-war rent was 20 yuan, the current statutory rent is 3,200 yuan. After deducting the house tax of 640 yuan, the net income is 2,560 yuan. The current value is about 10 million yuan, and the municipal construction surtax of 10,000 yuan must be paid. The landlord would lose 7,440 yuan. If the landlord and tenant bear it equally, the landlord would also lose 2,440 yuan. Finally, Xu Yongzuo asked: "Is this method reasonable? Is it feasible? As a result, the landlord would have to abandon the house because not only would there be no money to be made from owning the house, but money would also have to be lost. Who would want a house? In this time of severe housing shortage, it is actually impossible. Moreover, if the municipal construction surtax is paid by the landlord, it becomes a property tax, which is unreasonable. As the name implies, it should be paid by those who enjoy municipal construction."

Speaker Pan on Collection Methods

Speaker Pan discovered a very strange thing. He said: "It is currently very difficult to estimate the value of houses, and the appraisers of the Finance Bureau can manipulate the values, which will inevitably lead to abuses. The municipal construction surtax is levied according to the current value of the house. Councilor Xu Yongzuo has already given a report with figures. I have also done a rough calculation, but the result I calculated is about higher than Councilor Xu's. A Class C house should pay a municipal construction surtax of 12,000 yuan, a Class B house should pay 120,000 yuan, and a Class A house should pay 800,000 yuan. But there is one very strange thing. If the house tax is paid according to the method in Document No. 2, the city government can collect 18 billion yuan in half a year, which is enough to make up for the budget deficit. But the burden on the tenant is reduced. I don't know how the Finance Bureau is appraising it, but this method is beneficial to the general public. We have decided to levy 20% of the actual rent as the house tax. Now we can adopt the method in Document No. 2, but not for the house tax, but for the municipal construction surtax. According to the method in Document No. 2, this autumn, the house tax for Class A houses will be three times higher than in summer, for Class B houses it will be two times higher than in summer, and for Class C houses it will be one time higher than in summer. The so-called summer house tax collection method is 14% of the 560 times the rent in the 26th year of the Republic. This means that for a Class C house with a rent of 20 yuan in the 26th year of the Republic, the summer house tax will be 1,512 yuan, the autumn tax will be 3,024 yuan, and the winter tax will be 6,048 yuan. The average of the autumn and winter seasons is only over 4,500 yuan, and the 20% of the actual rent paid by the landlord can also be deducted. But if 1/1000 is levied according to the current value of the house, even if the landlord bears half, the tenant will have to pay a municipal construction surtax of 5,000 yuan. So, according to this method, the tenant is cheaper. According to this method, for a Class B house with a pre-war rent of 100 yuan, the autumn tax will be 22,680 yuan and the winter tax will be 45,360 yuan. But according to the municipal construction surtax rate, if the tenant bears half, he will have to pay 50,000 yuan. For a Class A house with a pre-war rent of 500 yuan, the autumn tax will be 151,200 yuan and the winter tax will be 302,400 yuan. But according to the municipal construction surtax rate, if the tenant bears half, he will have to pay 375,000 yuan. Therefore, if we collect according to the method in Document No. 2 and deduct the house tax that the landlord should pay from the total amount, the tenant can save a lot of money. No matter which class of house it is, the money paid by the tenant is less than half of the municipal construction surtax levied according to the current value of the house. Therefore, I suggest adopting this method." The councilors applauded enthusiastically in agreement.

A Debate on the Burden Issue

Director Gu and Lu Shidao also provided explanations regarding the statistical reports. Director Gu explained that the burden on the landlord after 20% of the actual rent is levied as the house tax depends on the rent he collects. The higher the rent, the higher the house tax will naturally be. Lu Shidao explained that it is unreasonable for the municipal construction surtax to be borne by the landlord.

Traditional wisdom first looks at it from a theoretical perspective. He said: "I don't calculate numbers, but we must pursue the truth. To be honest, in terms of burden, neither the landlord nor the tenant can afford it. What is currently being levied is the municipal construction surtax. Whoever enjoys municipal construction must pay the tax. If the name is not proper, the words are not correct. We must understand this point. As for the landowner, he will have to pay the land price tax and the land appreciation tax in the future, and that amount will certainly be very large." Xi Yushu also spoke in pursuit of the truth, believing that the truth is that the municipal construction surtax should be borne by the tenant. Vice Speaker Xu said: "I am a worker but I am speaking for the capitalists. What rich people have in their hands now is definitely not real estate, but gold bars, US dollars, cotton yarn, and other goods. Taxes should be reasonable." The final conclusion was also that "the municipal construction surtax should be borne by those who enjoy municipal construction."

Zhang Zhihan stood up and shouted loudly, asking the councilors not to think too much about the landlords and forget about the residents. They must know that the residents cannot afford it either. Wang Jian'e also firmly maintained that the burden on the tenants should be taken into account.

Don't Forget the Second Landlords

Li Wenjie, Jin Runxiang, Tao Baichuan and others all expressed many opinions on the method of estimating the current value of houses. Feng Youzhen reminded everyone not to forget the third type of person besides the landlord and the tenant: the second landlord. Because he is a tenant to the first landlord, and he is a landlord to the second tenant, he always benefits and takes advantage of everything. Therefore, we must not relax our control over the second landlord.

The councilors engaged in heated debates. But in the end, Speaker Pan stood up and spoke, finally obtaining the approval of an absolute majority, and the bill was resolved.

### Public Works Bureau Borrows 2 Billion Yuan to Order 100 Buses; Expected to Arrive in Shanghai from the United States Next Spring

[Report from Our Newspaper] Since the 45th Municipal Council meeting approved the Public Works Bureau to borrow 2 billion yuan from the Bank of Communications to purchase new buses, the Public Works Bureau has been actively proceeding. The loan has been arranged with the Bank of Communications and the Bank of China, and preparations are being made to order 100 new buses from a major automobile company in the United States. All specific plans have been drafted and will be implemented after being approved by the Municipal Council meeting this Friday. If all goes well, the new buses will be shipped from the United States to Shanghai next spring, and can be used immediately without any procedures.

In addition to planning to thoroughly improve the city's transportation, the Public Works Bureau is also providing newly installed temporary buses every month to meet current urgent needs. There are currently six routes in operation. Starting from the beginning of next month, the seventh bus route will be opened, with the planned route being from Hongkou Park on North Sichuan Road to Sichuan Road Bridge. There are more than ten temporary buses running on this route, all of which have been converted from large trucks. The Bureau has also agreed with the Materials Supply Bureau of the Executive Yuan that these large trucks can be supplied in a continuous stream. It is hoped that the continuous operation of temporary buses will solve some of the transportation difficulties.

### Night Soil Boats Scramble for Business, Yang Qishan Accused, District Court Opened for Trial Yesterday

[Our Newspaper's Report] During the enemy-puppet period, Wang Yongkang contracted the cleaning affairs of various night soil wharves in the city and organized the Da Kang Cleaning Company to handle the matter. Xu Yongquan was assigned to be in charge of the Guanqiao wharf to arrange the berthing order for night soil boats (meaning that night soil boats should be loaded according to their numbers and not scramble for priority). After the victory, Wang was arrested and imprisoned on suspicion of being a traitor. Yang Qishan, a gang leader from the Nanshi wharf, had many followers and was very influential. His disciples, Shen Baoyou, Gu Dabao, etc., used the excuse that Xu Yongquan's berthing arrangement was unfair and took the lead in making things difficult. Shen Baoyou had been reported to the Penglai Road Military Police Station by Xu Yongquan under the guise of being a guerrilla during the enemy-puppet period and was detained once. Therefore, after the victory, he came out to obstruct Xu Yongquan's berthing arrangement and caused conflict. He also accused Xu Yongquan of being a traitor to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters. Under duress, Xu Yongquan compromised and became a disciple of Yang Qishan, and Shen wrote a settlement agreement. Yang Qishan then obtained the right to arrange berthing order and jointly discussed the handling terms, which were registered with the Social Affairs Bureau but not approved. There was still conflict and fighting between the Jiangbei gang and the Shanghai-Songjiang gangs at the Guanqiao wharf, and they attacked each other in the newspapers, causing constant disturbances. After being reported, the police arrested them and transferred them to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. Yang Qishan was charged with disrupting the loading of night soil boats and directing his disciples Chen Zhixiang and Shen Baoyou to exercise berthing arrangement rights, forcing boat owners to comply, and obstructing the freedom of loading of various night soil boats. He was prosecuted for disrupting order and undermining social security. The trial opened at the District Court yesterday afternoon, and after investigation, the court ordered a new hearing at a later date.

### Rickshaw Puller Ke Feng Returns Lost Property to Owner

Upon arrival, he hurriedly left his public affairs briefcase in the rickshaw, containing a Bank of China draft for 9.8 million national currency, a US dollar draft for 320 US dollars, a gold ring, and a Shanghai Bank passbook. He discovered the loss after entering the house and reported it to the Changshu Branch. Before long, the rickshaw puller found the briefcase on the way and quickly sent it to Xi's residence and handed it over to Qian Hongyuan. His honesty is commendable.

### Sun Zuji Sentenced to Seven Years, Xia Qifeng to Be Sentenced on the 30th

[Our Newspaper's Report] The High Court yesterday announced sentences in two cases of suspected traitors: Sun Zuji, who successively served as the puppet Hangzhou Mayor, the puppet Huaihai Provincial Finance Director, and the puppet Insurance Regulatory Bureau Director, was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment and deprived of civil rights for seven years. Liu Zhenqun, a specialist in the Secretarial Office of the puppet Central Political Committee, was sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment and deprived of civil rights for two years.

Xia Qifeng, a "three-dynasty veteran," was tried by the High Court Collegial Panel yesterday, and the sentence will be announced on the 30th of this month. Xia is from Taixian, Jiangsu, and is 59 years old. When the War of Resistance against Japan broke out, he defected to the enemy. He served as the Deputy Minister of the Puppet Ministry of Interior in the "Renovation Government" in Nanjing. Later, when the Northern China gang organized the "Provisional Government" under the leadership of Wang Kemin, Xia went to Ping to serve as the Director of the Political Affairs Department of the Affairs Department of the Joint Committee of the Puppet Government. In September of the 28th year, he returned south to serve as the Puppet Foreign Minister of the "Renovation Government." When Wang Jingwei organized the "National Government," he served as the Puppet Minister of Auditing, concurrently as a member of the Puppet Central Executive Committee and a standing director of the Puppet "Great People's Association." This association specialized in promoting pro-Japanese ideas and inciting the people to follow the enemy.

Additionally, the cases of the Hungarian Iriczy, who was accused of providing gasoline and alcohol to the enemy, and Lin Zhixing, the enemy military police translator, will be sentenced on the 30th of this month.

Several cases were investigated on the same day: (1) Ke Puyang, the secretary of the White Russian Emigrants Association, was accused of colluding with Kuroki, a representative of the enemy military department, to assassinate the two former anti-Japanese chairmen of the association.

### Foreign Nationals Attempt to Restrict Freedom of Speech, Case Closely Watched by Chinese and Foreign Journalists, American Reporter Sued, Trial Concluded, Lawyers for Both Sides Gave Eloquent Arguments, Court Adjourns, Sentencing on the 27th

[Our Newspaper's Report] The District Court continued the trial yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM of the case of defamation filed by Shen Ke, a German national suspected of being a Nazi, against Lundahl, the Shanghai Office Director of the American United Press. The gallery was packed, with Americans accounting for almost half of the audience. Shen Ke did not attend and was represented by his agent, lawyer Yao Zhaodi. Lundahl was represented by lawyer Chen Tingrui. The lawyers for both sides engaged in fierce debate. At 4:30 PM, the court announced the conclusion of the debate and scheduled sentencing for 2:00 PM on the 27th. According to Chen Tingrui, although the court has scheduled a sentencing date, it does not necessarily indicate that the case will be accepted.

The trial began in an extremely tense atmosphere. When Lundahl stepped to the defendant's stand, he looked slightly uneasy. Yuan Lunren, a well-known reporter from United Press, stood beside him and translated everyone's speeches in a very low voice. Lawyer Yao first declared to the court that Shen Ke could not attend because he was detained in a US military court detention center. The court then approved Yao's representation.

According to International Law, Shen Ke Has No Right to Sue

Lawyer Chen Tingrui then stood up and defended Lundahl in a slow and forceful tone. He stated that according to the law, the court should not accept cases that are not filed as private prosecutions but are filed as such. Shen Ke's inability to file a private prosecution can be based on international law and the law of the Republic of China. According to international law, Shen Ke is a German national and a well-known Nazi member, listed on our country's list of those to be sent back to Germany, and is still detained in a US military court for war crime behavior. China and Germany have not yet made peace, and they are still in a state of war in the eyes of the law, so the plaintiff's identity is that of an enemy alien. There is no clear provision in our country regarding whether enemy aliens have the right to sue, but international law is a law jointly recognized internationally, so international law should be regarded as part of the laws of all countries. According to the provisions of international law after World War I, there is a relative right to recognition of enemy aliens' right to sue. The United Kingdom and the United States recognize the right of enemy aliens to sue, but there is a prerequisite that the enemy alien must continue to reside in the country and be a law-abiding citizen who is allowed to reside by the local government. Shen Ke has not been allowed by our government to continue residing in China, and the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has sent a letter certifying that "Shen Ke is one of the German expatriates on the list to be sent back to Germany and has been detained for war crime suspicions." Chen presented the letter as evidence and continued that this proves that Shen Ke is definitely not welcomed or allowed to stay in our country by the government. Moreover, Shen Ke is not only a Nazi Party member but also a Nazi spy! Therefore, according to international law, Shen Ke has no right to sue.

Based on the Provisional Constitution, Please Do Not Accept This Case

Next, regarding our country's Provisional Constitution, according to Article 15 of Chapter 2 of the Provisional Constitution, people have the freedom of speech and publication. Our government has also repeatedly declared freedom of speech as a political program. The defendant is the director of the United Press Office in China, and as a journalist, his freedom of speech should be strictly protected by law. Articles 19 and 7 of the Publication Law have relevant provisions. Journalists have always adhered to the principle of recording what they hear when reporting news, but now the plaintiff is trying to use the identity of a Nazi enemy alien to restrict the freedom of friendly nations and sue your court, which is insane! It must be known that Nazi law can prohibit the people's freedom of speech, but Nazi law can never be applied to democratic China! This case is not only related to journalists and publishers of friendly nations in China, but also has a very important relationship with journalists and publishers in our own country. Your court should not accept it.

Chen continued to cite the works of Oppenheim, an authority on international law, stating that enemy aliens cannot file lawsuits or have the right to defend themselves in court. He also cited Noyes, stating that the protection of foreign nationals should be limited to those who are law-abiding and continue to reside in the country. He also said that this case has attracted international attention. The Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury, an English newspaper in the city, published a cable from New York, stating that the outcome of this case will have a great impact on whether foreign journalists have freedom of speech in China. The Chinese government should not accept this case in order to maintain freedom of speech. He said that today, on behalf of the defendant, he asks the court to rule that the case not be accepted based on international law and the law of the land.

Plaintiff's Representative States That Private Rights Should Be Protected Regardless of Victory or Defeat

Lawyer Yao Zhaodi, the agent of Shen Ke, then stood up and replied that the defendant's lawyer's defense is based on international law and the law of the land. Now, he would like to reply to the legal aspect first. The law indeed stipulates freedom of speech, but this freedom should have appropriate restrictions, otherwise, the chapter on defamation in the criminal law could be abolished. Therefore, the so-called freedom should be freedom within the scope of the law. Whether the defendant has exceeded the freedom of speech stipulated by the law should still be investigated by the court before making a verdict of guilty or not guilty. As for international law, in feudal times, when wars occurred, the defeated had no other way but to become slaves. However, it should be known that this concept is a feudal concept. The various books presented by the defendant's lawyer have not been read by this seat, and it cannot be said whether they are excerpts taken out of context, but at most, they are just one person's opinion and are not sufficient as evidence. Regardless of victory or defeat, the private rights of the people should be protected. In 1907, various countries signed an international convention in The Hague, including China, the United States, and Germany. Article 23, Paragraph 8 of Chapter 4 of the convention expressly prohibits the abolition of the rights of the people of the defeated country to sue. People cannot live without their rights and cannot be without the protection of the law. To give an example, if the victim in a rape case that requires prosecution is a German expatriate, and they are not allowed to sue, then the case cannot be established!

The defendant's actions have indeed exceeded the scope that journalists should abide by. The source of his news is unknown, and the exaggerations are numerous. His actions have harmed our country's public order. After this case occurred, Lundahl actually appealed to the US State Department, intending to use the political power of his country to coerce our government! I urge the court to consider the facts of the case, be fair and calm, and discuss the case on its merits.

Shen Ke was sent back to his country in a "general" evacuation of expatriates. Those who are sent back are not necessarily bad people. Our government is only afraid that they will not be able to maintain their livelihood after staying in China, so they order them to return to their country. Therefore, the defendant's lawyer's statement that those who are sent back are bad elements is not worthy of consideration. Although Shen Ke has now been prosecuted, he has not yet been sentenced. The crimes prosecuted by the US military court are only espionage, and there is no factual basis. They actually want to fabricate the charges and deliberately create a major case!

At this time, Lawyer Chen angrily stood up and said that the prosecution of this case is illegal, and the defendant is unwilling to discuss the substance of this case through this illegal path.

There Are Three Pieces of Evidence

However, although Lawyer Yao was hit by this, he continued his statement, saying that the defendant cannot prove that the defamatory facts are true and reliable, and the plaintiff can prove that Lundahl's words are absolutely not true. There are three pieces of evidence: (1) Ambassador Chen Jie has a letter certifying that Shen Ke's actions have always been beneficial to China. (2) Shen Ke left Chongqing on July 11, 1941, via Hanoi to Shanghai, which can be proven by the visas on his passport. At the time he left Chongqing, China had not yet declared war on Germany. Now Lundahl claims that his departure from Chongqing was to sabotage our country's underground work, which is clearly a complete fabrication. (3) After Shen Ke returned to Shanghai, he often had contact with the important person in charge of our country's underground work. Wu Shaoshu has a letter certifying that he and Shen Ke often met due to the introduction of the person in charge of the organization department, and he called Shen Ke a loyal friend of China. In Chongqing, he often praised our country's war of resistance in his reports and exposed Germany's pro-Japanese tendencies. Wu's letter also stated, "We often meet, but there is no mutual use or exchange of information." He also said, "I have always trusted Shen Ke and have no doubts about him, so I often meet with him." He later declared, "My acquaintance with Shen Ke and the relationship that developed thereafter have been reported to the organization department for the record." It can be seen that what Lundahl wrote is purely fictitious.

Lawyer Chen then stood up again to reply, reiterating that Shen Ke's private prosecution is illegal and stating that Nazis have long disregarded international law and treaties. The self-sued agent dismissed Oppenheim's work as "one person's opinion", but no matter how brilliant the self-sued agent's study of international law is, it may not be as good as this authority. The binding degree of the Hague Convention varies according to different theories, and whether it applies should be determined by each country's government itself. Taking the United Kingdom and Germany as an example, they had already expressed that they did not recognize it. The binding of the treaty should take reciprocal treatment, and Germany itself has already suspended its application. Now, it wants to seek its protection?

Why Doesn't He Arrive, Why is He Detained

To say that the defendant attempts to use political power to coerce China is even more laughable! It concerns international issues between China, the United States, and Germany. It is not excessive for the defendant to seek the opinion of his own government, and there is no attempt to use political power at all! The plaintiff should know that he has a guilty conscience because he actually wants to use the power of the Chinese court's judgment to try to overturn the US military court's conclusive evidence.

The self-sued agent also said that the enemy expatriates who are sent back are not necessarily bad people, which also lacks common sense. The Chinese government sends back enemy expatriates without a fixed standard. The Nazi elements, spies, and hooligans who were sent by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs were sent back. If the 2,000 German expatriates who remained in China sued here today, this lawyer would not object. Also, may I ask whether Chinese expatriates in Germany had the right to sue Germany when China and Germany were at war? Only if it can be proven that there is indeed the right to sue can one talk about reciprocity. Moreover, the publication of this news was not limited to the United Press. The Associated Press had it, and the Shen Bao and Xinwen Bao also had it. The source of the news was actually a press conference held by the US military headquarters. Finally, there is one more point: according to our country's criminal procedure law, the self-sued agent should not be accepted if he fails to arrive after being summoned without a valid reason. The self-sued agent in this case has been summoned twice. Why doesn't he arrive? If it is said that it is because he is detained, then for what reason is he detained? Can it be considered a valid reason? I still ask the court to consider it.

Lundahl then began to speak after standing for an hour and a half, stating that he completely agreed with the arguments of his defense counsel and did not want to prove whether Shen Ke was a spy today. The source of his reports was the US military department, and the self-sued agent seems to want him to prove whether the words of the US military authorities are true.

At 4:30 PM, the court announced the conclusion of the debate and scheduled sentencing for 2:00 PM on the 27th.

### US Military Officer Suspected of Smuggling, Large Amount of Luxury Goods Intercepted

[Our Newspaper's Report] Several months ago, a large number of smuggled goods from the United States arrived in Shanghai and were sold throughout the city. US Navy Lieutenant Warner was suspected of being heavily involved. The US Navy authorities sent personnel to monitor him and appointed Lieutenant Asah to be responsible for the search. Warner secretly sent a letter to a well-known American lawyer, Roger, entrusting him to handle unfinished business. Roger loaded more than a dozen letters related to smuggling and eleven packages containing a large number of nylon stockings, lipsticks, perfumes, and other luxury goods into a car the other day. When the car was passing the Bund, Li Tingzhu, a bailiff sent by the District Prosecutor's Office, showed a search warrant. At the same time, the police station, customs, and other agencies also sent personnel to the scene. The untaxed luxury goods were all seized and escorted back for investigation.

### Electric Heaters Prohibited This Winter to Reduce Electricity Burden

[Our Newspaper's Report] Winter is coming soon. In addition to actively preparing winter clothing, you must also be thinking about how to keep your bedroom and living room warm in the severe cold. Undoubtedly, installing a heater is the most ideal, both economical and convenient. However, this year is different from previous years. The city's electricity demand has already exceeded electricity production. Factories are even having rotating power outages, let alone the luxurious electric heating. In order to maintain normal power supply, Mayor Wu has decided to prohibit the use of electric heaters this year. The power company will dismantle the electric heating devices of users throughout the city. The direct supply of current to electric stoves will remain the same. If the Shanghai Electric Power Company removes the extra burden of electric heaters, then the electricity for lighting and electric stoves (limited to those officially installed with electric stove meters) can be supplied abundantly, and there is no need to worry about the power problem in winter.

### Daytime Robbery in a Busy Area, Daring to Resist Arrest and Open Fire, Asia Money Exchange Suffers Heavy Losses

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday was the first anniversary of the opening of the Asia Money Exchange at No. 818 North Sichuan Road. The business was booming because of the recent surge in gold and US dollars. Unexpectedly, at 1:00 PM, a robber wearing a dark blue suit, carrying a briefcase, claimed to want to buy a large gold bar. A clerk led him to the inner room. While looking at the goods, the robber opened the briefcase, pulled out two automatic weapons, and forced all personnel not to make a sound. At that time, five other robbers, each holding firearms, followed in. One robber acted as a lookout, sitting on the counter outside the room, pretending to be a staff member. One robber guarded the back door, one robbed, and two guarded the clerks. While they were robbing, a Russian man came to sell US dollars. He was driven into the inner room by the lookout robber and ordered to "sit down" in English. The robbers stole more than one hundred taels of gold, eight million national currency, and two thousand five hundred US dollars, all of which were packed into a travel bag. At that time, the lookout robber shouted, "The wind is coming," and they all rushed out of the front door and fled north. When the robbery was taking place, a Zhou surnamed employee of the exchange took the opportunity to slip out of the back door and reported to the nearby police officer. Therefore, when the robbers carried the loot out of the store, the police officer fired at them. The robbers also returned fire and resisted arrest. Because the area was busy, the robbers were able to escape. After Commissioner Xuan heard the news, he ordered the Hongkou Police Sub-bureau to solve the case within a time limit because the robbers dared to rob in broad daylight.

### A Smuggling Case via Air Transport Cracked with Twists and Turns; Large Scale; Offices Set Up in Major Cities Including Beiping, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Taiwan; Thirteen Men and Women to be Escorted to the District Procuratorate Today

[Our Report] Recently, the air transport drug trafficking case cracked in this city has led to the arrest of over twenty suspects. After days of investigation by the police bureau, except for some who were released on bail due to insufficient evidence, the remaining thirteen suspects (including one female) have all been interrogated. Today, they, along with confiscated morphine and gold bars worth approximately 100 million yuan, and specially made suitcases with hidden compartments used for transporting drugs, will be transferred to the district procuratorate. The process of cracking the case was quite tortuous. The Criminal Police Division of the police bureau mobilized officers from the Second Section, working day and night to pursue clues, even extending the police network to Beiping, Tianjin, Taiwan, and other places. As a result, all were eventually apprehended.

It began on the 10th of this month when Director Xuan received a confidential report stating that a major drug lord, Song Zhian, residing at No. 32, Hehe Lane, Lin Sen Middle Road, had recently entrusted a large sum of money to the Shanghai Xinhua Bank to be remitted to Tianjin. This money was intended for purchasing and transporting morphine. Director Xuan immediately instructed Director Zhang of the Criminal Division that evening to send officers to investigate. After Director Zhang and Section Chief of the Second Section discussed it, they immediately dispatched Section Member Feng Qishan and Clerk Li Xiqing to Hehe Lane to investigate. Unexpectedly, the place turned out to be an empty house, and the homeowner, Zhu Qishan, had also escaped when arrested by the district procuratorate in a drug trafficking case ten days ago. Feng and others, suspecting the circumstances, conducted a search and found a deed for a house Zhu Qishan had sublet at No. 10, Pan'neng Street. They tracked and investigated until the afternoon of the 11th, when they finally learned the address where Zhu Qishan was hiding. They then led police officers Zhang Yunming, Ding Zhaogan, Gao Fuhai, Ding Wenjiang, and others to Room 12, No. 4, Kunshan Garden, and arrested Zhu in the suite. On the spot, they confiscated two pounds of coffee essence and half a washbasin of black poisonous material. While they were searching, a Taiwanese man named Sun Zhicheng arrived with four gold bars, weighing a total of 39 taels, 5 mace, and 4 fen, intending to purchase morphine. He was immediately detained, and officers were dispatched to his residence at No. 9, Jishan Lane, Wuchang Road, where they confiscated three pounds and two taels of morphine raw material and one pistol. At that time, a well-dressed, burly Hebei man arrived with an officer. The officer was carrying a suitcase. Upon entering the room and discovering the unusual situation, they attempted to flee, but were stopped by the police officers. After interrogation, one was identified as Zhang Mingyuan, 32 years old, and the other claimed to be a colonel officer of the 94th Army named Yan Dongfu, 37 years old, stating that they had just arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin on a China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) flight. When the police officers asked them to produce their identification, they evaded the request, confirming the suspicion of impersonation. The suitcase they were carrying was opened and inspected, and three pounds and five taels of morphine raw material were found in the hidden compartment of the suitcase. At this point, in addition to taking the above-mentioned suspects into custody, the police officers continued to guard the premises day and night. Meanwhile, the Hongkou Police Precinct also received confidential reports and apprehended five accomplices in the case at No. 54, Yifu Lane, Baoshan Road, Room 311 of the Royal Hotel, and other locations, including Taiwanese citizens Li Hongying, Zhang Gengtian, Zhang Yiren, Li Dingguo, and Zhang Li Bingkun (female). Details have been recorded in this newspaper. Later, during the investigation, the police bureau learned that the main offices of the case were located in Beiping, Tianjin, Taiwan, and other places, and that the key person in charge was Song Zhian. A telegram was sent to the Tianjin Police Bureau to assist in the apprehension, and he was apprehended on the 15th of this month. In Shanghai, four more suspects, Zhou Da, Ma Baiwu, Lü Xinquan, and Song Zixin, were successively apprehended, and three specially made suitcases with hidden compartments, thirty-five rubber sleeves for storing morphine, and a large amount of evidence such as drug trafficking profit distribution lists and copies of telegrams were confiscated. A Northeastern Advance Army identity card and a Northeastern Advance Army military certificate were also found at Zhou Da's residence, it was said.

### Public Land Sale Reported; Former French Municipal Council Sold It Privately During the Enemy Puppet Period; Municipal Government Has Ordered the Land Administration Bureau to Thoroughly Investigate and Report

### Two Major Cultural and Educational Cases in Beiping; Fu Sinian Presents Separate Opinions

[Our Report from Beiping, 23rd] As Fu Sinian is about to leave Beiping to return south after completing his mission as the "Forward Command Post of Peking University," two major events involving Fu Sinian have been published in the newspapers: (1) Fu Sinian strongly disagrees with the verdict of the Hebei Higher Court acquitting Bao Jianqing, the puppet Peking University president. He cited four reasons, including Bao's leadership of students on a study trip to Japan and the publication of an article titled "Ramblings on the Greater East Asia War and Our Determination," and requested a retrial. The prosecutor has already requested a retrial. (2) Su Ting, a member of the investigation team, accused Ta Kung Pao and Beiping Yishi Pao of not publishing news released by the team regarding the embezzlement of Japanese Kojima Ryosho's ancient books and paintings by Shen Jianshi, a special commissioner of the Ministry of Education. Fu Sinian specifically wrote to the investigation team, believing that Su Ting should not have made this accusation before confirming that Shen Jianshi was at fault.

### Do Not Hope to Adorn Unnecessary Educational Scenes with the Blood and Sweat of Countless Citizens

City Councilors Shen Ding and Others Propose Abolishing Art Normal Schools, etc.

[Our Report] City Councilors Shen Ding, Jiang Huaishu, Lu Yinchu, He Yuanming, and others will propose a temporary motion on the last day of the extended City Council session today (the 24th), requesting the municipal government to order the Municipal Education Bureau to promptly adjust its affiliated institutions, conserve expenses, and popularize national education. The reasons are as follows: Upon reviewing the Municipal Education Bureau's policy report to the Provisional Council and the municipal government's proposed work plan for the 35th year (education section) submitted to this council, both include proposals to increase vocational schools, but in reality, there has been no active preparation. However, institutions not included in the plan, such as art normal schools, have suddenly opened, showing that the so-called plan of the Education Bureau is merely a document on paper. Therefore, previously established institutions, such as the Experimental Drama School and various central stations, may not necessarily have been considered for their value to the current stage of education in this city. The pressing need directly felt by all citizens is the lack of municipal primary and secondary schools, with children having no suitable places to study. We do not hope that the municipal government will use the blood and sweat of countless people to adorn unnecessary educational scenes. Therefore, we propose the following measures for public deliberation: Measures (1) The Experimental Drama School and Experimental Public School, etc., should be abolished immediately, and the remaining school buildings should be converted into national schools. (2) The Municipal Art Normal School should be abolished immediately, and specialized normal schools should be merged with other normal schools. (3) The Music Center Station, Art Center Station, Labor Center Station, and Science Experimental Branch, etc., should be entrusted to various schools, institutions, and organizations to manage concurrently, or directly abolished. They should not be independent institutions. (4) Other matters that should be delayed or can be merged should be investigated and merged separately. (5) All expenses saved by abolishing unnecessary institutions should be used entirely to develop national education.

The Shanghai Industrial College, sponsored by the Shanghai Yarn Mill Association, opened yesterday (the 23rd). Over three hundred faculty, staff, and students attended.

He added that he has seen stable and comfortable lives abroad and, in contrast, the suffering and displacement of Chinese people and the low standard of living is tragic. To remedy this, we must start with developing industry, which is your responsibility. He hopes everyone will work hard, etc. Subsequently, board members Jiang Weiqiao, Tang Xinghai, Liu Piji, and others gave speeches of encouragement, moving the entire audience.

It is believed that the promotion of this research atmosphere will certainly improve the teaching aspects of each school.

### Wonderful Tactics Displayed in Full; Qunsheng Defeats the Dongfang Team Again

Sixty to Thirty-Eight, Almost Double; Qunsheng Wins All Three Games; Veteran Players Submit

[Our Report] The Qunsheng Basketball Team played its third game against the Dongfang Team in Shanghai yesterday. The Dongfang team, a disunited group lacking coordination, fought valiantly, but Qunsheng fully displayed its exquisite tactics. The veteran players of the Dongfang team were helpless. As a result, Qunsheng won again by a large margin of 60 to 38. The score at halftime was 30 to 20.

The two forwards were like butterflies dancing among the flowers, comparable at the top and bottom of the basket. It was truly wonderfully indescribable. Cai Wenhua and Cai Wenzhang's relaxed and accurate shooting won applause, and the harmony of the entire team during offense and the speed during defense can be said to have been fully displayed. No wonder the Dongfang team lowered its head in submission. The team's spirit was also highly commendable. There were also some displays of dissatisfaction with the referee, which we hope the players will correct. If there were no problems, then continue to encourage.

Leading from Start to Finish

The game started on time. Qunsheng sent Chen Jinde, Chen Jinzhi, Chen Wenhua, Cai Wenzhang, and Yang Renhui to the court. Dongfang countered with Ren Xiangcheng, Tang Baokun, Qin Xunze, Wang Nanzhen, and Liu Jingxing. After the start of the game, Qunsheng's Cai Wenhua scored twice, taking the lead. Dongfang fought hard, and Liu Jingxing and Qin Xunze tied the score at 4 each, then at 6 each. After that, Qunsheng used high-speed fast breaks and took the lead in each quarter. The Dongfang team only followed behind. The score at halftime was 30 to 20, with Qunsheng leading by ten points.

In the second half, both sides made substitutions. Cai Lianke of Qunsheng replaced Cai Wenzhang, and Zhang Shaoqing replaced Liu Jingxing. Ren Xiangcheng scored first, but it was a fleeting moment. Qunsheng then used its prowess again, and Cai Wenhua's accurate shooting from a hundred paces and his following up under the basket gradually widened the score difference, 46 to 23. The Dongfang team frequently adjusted its fresh troops to counterattack. By attacking with strength, Qunsheng substituted Zhang Yuyi and others. Dongfang chased hard, once making it 45 to 34. Qunsheng quickly used its ideal lineup, and the difference widened again. Later, Yang Renhui committed his fifth foul, but before long, the whistle blew. Qunsheng won all three games with a score of 60 to 38.

### The Rumors of Foreign Exchange Readjustment are Baseless; President Bei Claims to Have Heard Nothing About It; Efforts are Being Made to Curb Capital Flight to Hong Kong

[Report from our newspaper] Mr. Bei Zuyi, president of the Central Bank, told our reporter yesterday that the rumors in the market that foreign exchange will be readjusted again are purely baseless. Regarding the rumors in the capital that the relevant parties have drafted a plan to adjust foreign exchange by making frequent adjustments of small magnitude, he said that he had not heard anything about it and did not know what "relevant parties" were referring to. He said that, in short, all the recent rumors about foreign exchange in the market are completely unfounded. He is unwilling to comment too much in the newspaper so as not to provide materials for speculators to quote out of context.

Regarding the issue of capital flight to Hong Kong, he said that efforts are being made to find ways to curb it. He hopes that the people will abide by the law, which would be of great help.

The Central Bank will hold a working conference in the capital on Double Ten Day (October 10th). He said that this conference had not been held for a long time due to the impact of the war. This gathering will be attended by representatives from branches and offices across the country to brainstorm, exchange ideas, and study how to improve operations so that the Central Bank can become the bank of banks. At the same time, they will discuss how to communicate the business of headquarters and branches, and domestic remittance issues.

### Central Bank Stipulates Measures for Foreign Exchange Forward Delivery

The Central Bank, noting that a large number of merchants have applied to designated banks to postpone the delivery of foreign exchange sold on a forward basis, yesterday issued a circular to designated banks stipulating the following in detail regarding applications for postponing the delivery of foreign exchange:

(1) Merchants purchasing foreign exchange, except as provided in item 3, must have written documents proving the purpose of the purchase. These documents must be approved by the designated bank. The designated bank should pay close attention to its own responsibilities when reviewing the above applications.

(2) For imported goods, except as provided in items 3 and 4, there must be an irrevocable letter of credit or authorization to purchase (Irrevocable L/C or A/P) guaranteeing payment, unless otherwise permitted by the Central Bank.

(3) The above regulations may be separately negotiated for long-established importers with established payment practices, and the required amount shall be approved periodically according to their needs.

(4) For import bills of exchange collected by banks exceeding US$500 C.I.F. or its equivalent, the designated bank must first obtain permission from the Central Bank before selling the foreign exchange.

(5) The points listed in this circular do not apply to imported goods for which the provisions of Circular No. 26 of April 4th of this year are still valid.

(6) For foreign exchange sold on or after August 19th, if it is not settled upon maturity, the designated bank may cancel the transaction at the market price on the date of sale on the due date. The cancelled foreign exchange must be resold to the Central Bank at the original purchase price.

### Quiet Bond Market

Yesterday, public bonds remained difficult to rally under sporadic retail sales. The overall level opened at 1800 yuan, and the highest price was only 1850 yuan. It fell to 1760 yuan in the middle of the day and hovered between 1780 yuan and 1800 yuan at the close. The process was extremely quiet, with no special changes. The trading volume was only over 2 million yuan. As a result, Class A, B, and C bonds each fell by 80 yuan compared to last Saturday, while Class D and E bonds fell by a small amount of 60 yuan.

### Sluggish Stock Market

The foreign stock market remained in a state of decline and could not recover. Securities dealers were shaken. Except for steel stocks, other stocks showed signs of wavering. Ewo Yarns fluctuated quite a bit. It opened at 8600 yuan in the morning and fell to 8000 yuan before recovering. As a result, compared to last Saturday, steel stocks remained unchanged, Jardine Matheson and Amoy Paper slightly declined, Ewo Yarns, Ewo Brewery and China Merchants Steam Navigation fell by half a percent, and British American Tobacco fell by a weak 10%.

### Settlement Funds Arriving in Succession; US Dollars Reached New Highs; Shanghai Gold Followed the Trend

Shanghai Gold initially stabilized yesterday. At high prices, there was considerable pressure, and there was a lot of struggling. It opened slightly lower in the morning at around 2.175 million. After opening, many floating longs came out of the market. Disappointed buyers gradually fell from 2.178 million, with small declines. After 10:00 a.m., the Central Bank allocated 30 bars at a price of 2.165 million, and this could not be revived and could not be boosted. It once fell to 2.15 million before noon, but at noon, US dollars suddenly became popular again, and the price of gold rose sharply to about 2.175 million. In the afternoon, it was again stimulated by the rush to buy US dollars, rising to over 2.19 million before falling back slightly. The result was similar to last Saturday. Gold ornaments, silver bullion, and silver dollars were all flat. The black market interest rate remained at around 1.3%.

Foreign currencies initially weakened and then recovered. US dollars opened at 3750 yuan in the morning, and there was an outflow of settlements. Generally, floating longs from the previous week had their settlements. The price fell to 3640 yuan in the middle of the day before stabilizing. At noon, the trend of scraping settlements was prevalent again, and it surged to over 3800 yuan. In the afternoon, under the double pressure of settlements and those freezing foreign exchange, preemptive purchases pushed the price close to a high of 3900 yuan at the close. As a result, it was 110 yuan better than last Saturday, and the ratio to gold was 562 yuan per tael. Hong Kong banknotes initially stabilized and then became popular. They were even stronger in the afternoon. Generally, those who did not obtain US dollars scrambled to collect them, and the price also rose by 20 yuan, with Hong Kong exchange at 760 yuan and Indian exchange at around 920 yuan, with few sellers. British exchange was over 12,000 yuan, and US exchange was out of stock.

### Written Guarantee by Brokers

26 Designated Banks Accept and Process; Replacements Must be Prepared and Returned Within One Month

[Report from our newspaper] The Stock Exchange stipulates that the guarantee deposit for brokers is 50 million yuan each for the bond and stock markets. Apart from the 40% cash portion, which was notified to the brokers for payment on August 27th, the remaining 60% of securities and real estate for replacement had been submitted to the Ministries of Finance and Economy by the Exchange on August 24th for flexible handling. Now, the reply received stated: "Regarding the replacement portion of the guarantee deposit, flexible handling may be tentatively approved. Several member banks of the Shanghai market designated by the Central Bank will still be used. The brokers will contact these banks themselves to submit written guarantees as replacements. Each broker must replace this guarantee with replacements within one month from the opening date of the Exchange." The Exchange has complied. At the same time, it has approved the letter from the Business Bureau of the Central Bank designating 26 banks from the Shanghai Banking Association: Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Zhejiang Xingye Bank, China & South Bank, Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank, Jin Cheng Bank, New China Trust & Savings Bank, China Land Bank, Shanghai Guohua Bank, China Chenggong Bank, Juxingcheng Bank, China Bank, Sze Ming Bank, Zhongnan Bank, Zhongmao Bank, Dalu Bank, China Enterprise Bank, China Industrial Bank, China National Products Bank, Jianghai Bank, China Industrial & Mining Bank, China General Chamber of Commerce Bank, Zhejiang Jianye Bank, Guangdong Bank, and Guoxin Yiye Bank, to handle the written guarantee matters for the replacement portion of the Exchange brokers.

[Report from our newspaper] Arthur Morse, Chairman of HSBC, arrived in Shanghai a week ago. Mr. Bei, President of the Central Bank, and Mr. Chen, Vice President, will hold a tea party to welcome him at 5:00 p.m. today.

### Allotted Yarn Rose by 70,000 Yesterday; Still Cheaper Than the Black Market; Yarn Sales Slightly Sluggish; Cotton Cloth Prices Soaring; Not Much Supplied by the Joint Textile Construction Company

[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday, the yarn market rebounded and fell. Although the asking price was high in the morning, there were few buyers, and the price could not be sustained. This was because the price had risen significantly on Friday and Saturday of last week, and buyers were watching and making few purchases. The multi-sellers also made profits and sold off, so the price went down. 42-count and 20-count yarns fell by about 40,000 to 100,000. The decline in 16-count yarn was limited, and the opening price was around 1.557 million, almost at the same price as 20-count yarn, which is rare in the yarn market recently. Yesterday morning, futures for eight types of yarn were listed by the Joint Textile Construction Company, using a joint distribution method. The prices were not announced until around 7:00 p.m. (see the Market Prices section).

Application for Reduction; Allotted Price Increase

After the resolution that the total amount of the second group allotment of yarn to national and private yarn factories would still be 30,000 bales, the Joint Textile Construction Company was responsible for 12,000 bales, and the private factories were responsible for 18,000 bales. Yesterday afternoon, the Yarn Factory Joint Distribution Committee held its first opening of yarn. It was not until after 5:00 p.m. that it was decided to sell 905 bales of 20-count cotton yarn according to the standard amount of private factories, which was allotted at half the applied amount. In addition, 2,644 bales were sold due to the working capital of each factory before the second group of 30,000 bales of yarn was sold out after the first group allotment. These bales are now also included in the total amount of the second group allotment of 30,000 bales. However, the allotment price is still calculated at 1.35 million yuan per bale. In addition, the Joint Textile Construction Company allotted a total of 1,625 bales yesterday (however, the Joint Textile Construction Company said that 1,501 bales were allotted). The amount applied for, including various colored cotton yarns, totaled 7,567 bales. The opening price yesterday, based on 400 pounds of 20-count cotton yarn, was increased to 1.43 million yuan per bale, an increase of 70,000 yuan compared to the previous opening price. Considering the market price, the allotted price is still about 7% lower.

Association Notice; Eight Measures

The provisional measures for the sale of cotton yarn by each yarn factory decided at the meeting are excerpted as follows:

1. Customers purchasing cotton yarn are temporarily limited to the original customers of each factory, and applications from end-users are given priority.

2. The above-mentioned end-users who have a genuine need to purchase cotton yarn should first fill out an application form to the yarn factory they have been dealing with, stating the count, quantity, purpose, etc. of the cotton yarn they intend to purchase. The amount filled in by the customer in the application must be limited to the actual need. If there is speculation or false reporting, each factory may reduce or cancel the applicant's qualification.

3. After each yarn factory receives and reviews the purchase application, it will determine whether the applied quantity is accurate based on past yarn purchase records. If it is untrue, it should be corrected at any time and sent to the association before 12:00 noon every day for decision. Before 4:00 p.m. on the same day, the quantity and standard price (based on 20-count cotton yarn) decided by the association will be notified to each yarn factory and passed on to the applicant. Each yarn factory and applicant must not increase or decrease the decided quantity and price on their own.

4. If there is a surplus in the amount of cotton yarn to be sold by each factory, the association will distribute it on its behalf.

5. After receiving the notice, the applicant should immediately sign a sales contract with the factory and pay the full amount of the goods in cash the next day.

6. When selling cotton yarn, each yarn factory must weigh 400 pounds for each large bale and 10 pounds for each small bale, and no additional small branches are allowed.

7. The cotton yarn decided to be sold should be dispatched as soon as possible within ten days from the date of payment.

8. If the applicant fails to fulfill the contract or make payment after receiving the decision notice, the association may cancel its application qualification.

Peak Season; Cotton Cloth Soars

Yesterday, the cloth market continued to soar. Although sales to various regions were declining, sales in the city were particularly strong. This was because it was the peak sales season, and the number of retail sales in the city was high, so buyers continued to come. Due to the inability to purchase spot goods, and the supply from the Joint Textile Construction Company has increased prices invisibly since the adoption of the joint distribution method, but the supply is still limited, so they have to drop into recent futures for adjustment. Yesterday, the opening price of high-end greige cloth was about 80,000 yuan, pure wool serge was about 85,000 yuan, and pure electric light twill was 50,000 yuan.

### Market Selling is Rampant; Chinese Stocks are Weak Across the Board

Chinese stocks fell yesterday. Wing On Yarns was purchased by Cantonese, so the situation was relatively stable. When the market opened in the morning, the hot stocks were more colorful, and were above the afternoon close on Saturday. After opening, the two major hot stocks, Wing On Yarns and Meyer, were also participated in by new multi-sellers, and were once popular. However, Bei sellers forced Meyer, and Wing On Yarns was also subjected to universal cutting due to the unfavorable situation. Even with the absorption of Guangbang, such as No. 184, it was difficult to stop the selling pressure, and the process was only slightly more stable than Meyer. Later, Meyer experienced more and more incremental declines, and panic was even worse. In the middle of the day, there was a lack of maintenance, and buyers were helpless. As a result, the entire stock market was shrouded in gloom, and the weakness was even worse. Although China Silk had a small number of chips, the rebound was extremely limited. At the close, there were short positions profiting, and there was a slight rebound. As a result, compared with the previous close, Wing On Yarns, Sincere Co., China Silk, New Asia, Five Harmony all showed a slight decline, Meyer, New Kwong, Ching Foo, Chuen Hing, Tung Yih, China Textile, Tatung, Wing Fung and Match all fell by about half a percent, China Flour alone fell by 1.5 percent, and Cement fell by a weak 10 percent. The total transaction volume was 6,014,400 shares, of which Wing On Yarns accounted for 3,090,000 shares, Meyer 280,000 shares, Ching Foo more than 800,000 shares, New Kwong and Chuen Hing three to five hundred thousand shares, and the rest were sporadic transactions. Off-market stocks also fell by about half a percent.

### Indica Rice Falls Back, Japonica Rice Holds Firm; More Gains Than Losses for Coarse Grains and Oil Beans

Yesterday, the rice market fell as the sky cleared and the source of indica rice was continuous, and digestion turned weak. Various types of indica rice fell by a small amount of one to two thousand yuan, and white yuan fell by two to three thousand yuan. However, the delivery of new japonica and old japonica was scarce, and the situation was still stable. It is estimated that the registration of goods from the north and south markets was more than 11,000 stones. There was no market for flour yesterday, and there was no transaction for wheat bran. Soybean arrivals and sales were strong, and Shantou and Quanzhou were quite happy to accept them, and the price rose by 2,000 yuan. The Fujian side had a strong appetite for wheat, and the price rose step by step, adding another thousand yuan. Raw peanuts were accepted by Nanyang and this city, and demand exceeded supply, and they continued to soar by six to seven thousand yuan. Red sorghum was scarce and expensive by a thousand yuan, mung beans were high and stable, broad beans rose by a thousand yuan, and the oil market had mixed gains and losses. Raw oil had a lot of goods, and the price fell by another thousand yuan, soybean oil was strong, rapeseed oil rose slightly, and soybean cake rose by three to four hundred yuan.

### Customs Official Talks: Warehouses Have Been Cleared and Work is Completed; Maritime Theft Has Been Controlled

According to a responsible person from the Jianghai Customs: More than 100 wharves and warehouses received by the Customs have been cleared of enemy and puppet materials, and they have been returned to the original owners. Only a few areas in the city center are still awaiting clearance, and they can also be returned by the end of this month. Currently, imports and exports have not yet been expanded due to transportation relations. There are very few goods in each warehouse, and everyone feels that business is bleak.

Regarding theft incidents, the Customs is making every effort to prevent them, strengthening defense forces, and will restore maritime anti-smuggling ships. Once the allocation is approved, an anti-smuggling team will be established. Currently, maritime theft has been controlled, but theft at wharves and warehouses is beyond its power.

### Commercial Banks Organize Loan Groups; One Group Has Been Established

The loans for factories and exporters organized by the Central Bank are not limited to money shops. Commercial banks can also organize industrial and commercial loan syndicates to apply for re-mortgages from the bank. It is reported that the banks have organized separately according to the bank's methods. The first group has been formally established, with 10 banks participating, including Guanghua, Qiantai, Guangzhong, Dunsui, Minfu, Dalai, Bachuan, Huamao, Yongtai, and Guofu. The loan quota has been sent to the Central Bank and will be signed in the next few days. In addition, 17 banks from Sichuan, including Sichuan Salt, Sichuan Kang, Chongqing, Meifeng, and Juxingcheng, and 7 banks, including Women, Yongxiang, and Coal Industry, are also being organized separately. The second and third loan syndicates can be formally established soon.

### Alarming Handling Fees: No Set Amount

According to the transportation industry, the handling fees for goods at various wharves recently are truly alarming. A few days ago, Sullivan Company transported 12,000 bags of flour from the United States. It cost a total of 6.25 million yuan to transport the flour from the ship's hold to the warehouse. The shipping companies also have no set amount for this fee and must be paid in advance before the goods can be picked up. In addition, when the cargo owner ships goods from the warehouse within ten days, they must pay another 300 yuan per bag. Based on the 12,000 bags of flour alone, the external fees from picking up the goods from the ship's hold to the warehouse to shipping the goods from the warehouse exceed 10 million yuan.

### Anthracite Coal Prices Rise Again

In the coal market, anthracite coal lumps continued the previous trend, and market prices rose sharply again. Anthracite coal smalls followed suit, and anthracite coal dust remained flat. The price of screened lumps of bituminous coal rose slightly due to the allocation of the Fuel Management Committee, and the Kaiping train screened lumps at the Maigen Road stack in Puxi were of soft and inferior quality.

### A Comparative Study of the Old and New Income Taxes

— Xu Riqing

(3) Implementation of Comprehensive Income Tax

The classified income tax system previously implemented in our country levied taxes based on income sources, such as profits from enterprises, interest from deposits, and rental income from properties. Therefore, it could be called an income tax. It failed to meet the principle of fairness based on ability to pay. Comprehensive income tax, on the other hand, taxes all income, hence its alternative name, general income tax. It uses the individual taxpayer's income as the calculation unit, and is therefore also called "from-name" tax, which means that all kinds of income of each taxpayer are added up to form total income, and various expenses are deducted from the total income, which is then used as the standard for taxation. For example, France, in implementing comprehensive income tax, stipulates that all people within French territory with an annual income of more than 7,000 francs must pay this tax.

Article 3 of the new income tax law stipulates that, in addition to the classified income tax levied according to the previous article, an additional comprehensive income tax shall be levied on individuals whose total income exceeds 600,000 yuan. The calculation method is to combine all kinds of personal income for the whole year to form the total income, but the following items can be deducted: 1. 100,000 yuan for each family member living together, or relatives who must be supported; 2. 50,000 yuan for each family member who is a student in secondary or higher education; 3. Various income taxes and land taxes already paid (Article 19 of the same law). The reporting method requires taxpayers to report the type and amount of their income in the previous year to the competent collection agency before May 1st each year. The competent collection agency and district, township, and town offices, or central primary schools, establish a joint reporting committee for review (Article 26 of the same law), to prevent the malpractice of false reporting or non-reporting.

In the past, our country used the pretext of lax household registration and incomplete statistics to avoid implementing the comprehensive income tax. This time, the resolute decision to implement it is not without good reason. In the future, there will inevitably be many difficulties in collecting the comprehensive income tax. As the saying goes, "Human power can overcome nature." It is expected that there will be a day to overcome these difficulties.

At the beginning of the establishment of the comprehensive income tax, people in society and in the media feel that it is redundant. In fact, the classified income tax is a tax on income, while the comprehensive income tax is a tax on people. There is absolutely no redundancy, because the targets are different. The comprehensive income tax best embodies the principle of ability to pay. At the same time, a progressive tax system must adopt progressive tax rates. Our country's classified income tax is limited by the environment and insufficient conditions, and has failed to exert its effectiveness in making those with more income pay more, and those with less income pay less. Taking securities deposit income as an example, it is unreasonable to levy 10% on both 10,000 yuan and 10 million yuan of deposit income. Therefore, the government adopts comprehensive income tax to make up for its deficiencies and prevent wealth from tending to concentrate. The original intention of the legislation is perfect. Whether the implementation can be smooth remains to be seen through the efforts of those in charge. Furthermore, considering the advanced countries, countries that first levy classified income tax and then levy comprehensive income tax include France, the United Kingdom, and Italy. Moreover, the tax rates of comprehensive income tax in various countries are higher than those in our country. For example, the United States levies a minimum of 13%, the United Kingdom 10%, and Japan 10%. The United States levies a maximum of 72%, the United Kingdom 45%, and Japan 60%, while our country levies a minimum of 5% (that is, for those exceeding 600,000 yuan) and a maximum of no more than 50%.

(4) A Major Prerequisite—Economic Stability

The content of the new income tax law promulgated this time has taken into account the actual situation and objective needs, and is gradually moving towards a rational path, which is gratifying. However, only four months have passed since the promulgation of the new income tax law. Due to the daily depreciation of currency and the rising prices of goods, all the provisions seem to be outdated. Taking only the starting point of the comprehensive income tax in the new income tax law, it is already too low. It is said that this starting point was based on the pre-war Shanghai living survey data and the result of calculating the retail price increase of 2,220 times in September of the 34th year of the Republic. According to the Shanghai Important Commodity Retail Price Index compiled by the Economic Research Department of the Central Bank, Shanghai's current prices in June of this year have increased more than 3,700 times. Now, after three months, plus foreign exchange adjustments, prices have risen, estimated at 4,000 times, or even 10,000 times. In contrast, all suffer from the disease of being outdated. Other provisions, such as the tax exemption points for salary and remuneration income tax, are also the same. Therefore, all good laws and good intentions must be under one major prerequisite—economic stability—before they can be effective. (The End)

### Journey to Northern Jiangsu (6): The Shadow of Blood on the Eastern Battlefield of Taixian

— Special Correspondent Hang Zhou

Taixian Dispatch from Our Newspaper on the 10th

There are two long dikes in northern Jiangsu, which are well known to people: on the left is the Grand Canal dike, and on the right is the Fan Gong dike. The area between the dikes is a large swampy region. In the past, people had to fear every year that floods would wash away the Grand Canal dike, turning this area into a marshland. Since the Communist Party's army came to northern Jiangsu, people's fear of floods has been transferred. There are too many examples to prove that wherever the Communist army goes, it becomes a "sea of blood." "Sea of blood" is a more terrifying term than "flood"!

The terrain of northern Jiangsu restricts military activities, so battles take place either on the Grand Canal dike or on the banks of the Fan Gong dike. When the battle of Shaobo was in full swing in late August, the Communist army launched a sudden attack on the right wing. Places such as Rugao, Haian, Qutang, and Huangqiao once again saw the unfolding of battles, and the people who had just returned home once again embarked on the path of destruction.

As a result, the center of gravity of the battle quickly shifted to the right. The Communist army's offensive was clearly not only in response to the left, but also had the intention of further capturing Liangtai and threatening Jiangnan. More than a month ago, the Communist army made such an attempt and was disastrously defeated. Now it has reorganized its forces, and the government army must naturally crush it again.

The Second Phase of the War - Episode 2

The situation on the right wing is dangerous, and the Communist army is rampant. Taking Haian as an example, the Communist army used twelve regiments to surround the National army, which was only one-fifth of its size. However, after fighting for more than a week, the Communist army could not move Haian by a single inch. Qutang and Da Xiaobaimi have already fallen into the hands of the Communist army. The situation in Huangqiao was once unclear, but fighting is still going on nearby. Within the pocket-shaped area from Rugao to Baimi in the northwest and to Huangqiao in the southwest, there are many mobile Communist troops. Major and minor battles are constantly taking place on the outskirts of Taixian and Taixing.

The right wing is "lively," while the left wing seems to be silent. On September 6, the reporter boarded a "chicken bus" running on the Yangtai Road in Yangzhou to take a look at the second episode of the second phase of the war in northern Jiangsu.

The Yangtai Road is a major artery in northern Jiangsu at present. The National army has put a lot of effort into opening it up and maintaining it. There are many fortresses on both sides of the highway. These fortresses have all been stained with blood in front of them. Although they can no longer be seen now, I have seen, one by one, the smiles of the farmers who are harvesting the abundant rice crops, thanks to those bloodstains. Northern Jiangsu is having a great harvest year this year. The Chinese farmers who "rely on heaven for food" should have thanked God, but in Gaoyou, Baoying... in those so-called "liberated areas," how many farmers are still shedding tears over their harvest!

Universal Vigor and Energy - Acting on What is Said

After passing through checkpoints one after another, I arrived in Taixian. This is the reporter's second trip to Tai. Yangzhou is like a middle-aged woman, but Taixian is much younger. What I feel is universal vigor and energy. County Magistrate Ding Zuobin is a graduate of the 16th class of the military academy and was a guerrilla commander. He is a complete soldier. The district chiefs, township chiefs, self-defense captains, and even the secretaries and section chiefs in the county government are all related to the military academy and guerrilla warfare. They have gone through thick and thin together, and now they are also facing difficulties. They laugh and joke on weekdays, but when they work, they are really energetic and quick. Among the counties controlled by the National army in northern Jiangsu, Taixian can be said to be the one that can cooperate with the military. Repairing roads and building fortifications, they act on what is said. Ding Zuobin cannot sit idly in the county government office for three days. He likes to run around and see everything. Some things that need to go through four or five official procedures and take ten or eight days to resolve, he goes to the countryside himself and resolves with a single word.

The current soldiers are not all uneducated. Some have quite a good grasp of political cultivation. Ding Zuobin has the straightforward and enthusiastic character of a northerner. The people of Taixian are proud to have such a county magistrate. He said that he doesn't know how to be an official, only how to do things. He said to his subordinates, "Don't ruin my affairs."

Jiangnan is the land of fish and rice, while Jiangbei is the land of salt and rice. Both are equally rich. If Jiangnan and Jiangbei have different styles, the most obvious may be in the character of the people: Jiangnan is weaker, while Jiangbei is quite strong. Strong folk character with organization is a very good local armed force. The general feeling in northern Jiangsu is that the local armed force is not enough, but Taixian has quietly made quite a bit of progress. Every township has its own self-defense force, with more than 2,000 people in the county and more than 1,000 guns, which has helped the army a lot.

In the past two days, Dasizhuang, more than 20 miles southeast of Taixian and 18 miles from the Kukou Tai Highway, was attacked by the Communist army. There are no National army stationed there. The self-defense force resisted alone and did not allow the Communist army to gain an advantage. Ding Zuobin received the report and personally led 400-500 self-defense forces to reinforce the area, and drove the Communist army away at once.

Jiangyan is Close to the Frontline - Hearing the Sound of Machine Guns

On September 7, the reporter, along with Wu Xiaode, chief of staff of the 108th Brigade, and staff officer Gao Hongsheng, inspected the eastern battlefield of Taixian. Ding Zuobin also went along.

Departing early in the morning, we first arrived at Jiangyan. On the Taijiang Road, commercial vehicles disappeared, and military vehicles charged back and forth, quickly covering 36 miles. Jiangyan is a large town and market, a distribution center for grain. In previous years, the grain transport ships parked here were connected for three or four miles. This place is only ten miles away from Magou, the front line, and the sound of machine guns can be heard clearly every night. People are used to hearing it and are never disturbed by it. A bathhouse is still painting its facade and choosing an auspicious day to open. We didn't stay long and rushed to Magou.

Magou is a very important stronghold in the sense of defending Taixian. Since the Communist army launched its offensive, it has cut off the Taihai Road. On the night of August 29, it gathered more than two regiments and took advantage of the fact that the National army had just changed defenses to attack Magou directly, hoping to take it down in one fell swoop, threatening Jiangyan and coercing Taixian. The defending force of Magou was only one company, but this company was not flustered at all. "Fighting does not depend on the number of people." They defended calmly in the fortifications, hitting one when it came, and hitting two when two came. The Communist army surrounded Magou, charging again and again, and those who came up could not go back. Company Commander Zheng Yadong heard the Communist army's charge horn in the trench, which blew a total of 20 times. It can be seen that the 19 charges were all over, and the 20th charge could not avoid the final fate, and they also fell. The dark night passed in battle, and the enemy's gunfire died down. The brothers jumped out of the trenches in the light of the sun and looked: "Ah! So many corpses!" They were so excited that they forgot their fatigue and counted them. There were three or four hundred bodies.

As soon as I arrived at Magou, the brothers of Zheng Yadong Company scrambled to tell me about this wonderful battle. I deliberately dampened their spirits and asked:

"How many casualties did you have?"

"One died and four were injured," a soldier replied triumphantly.

One to four hundred, or five to two thousand (the total number of Communist army casualties), this record must make the Communist army grit their teeth.

Sure enough, the restless Communist army came to "avenge" every night afterwards, but every night they used corpses as gifts.

We once stood on a bunker to observe the terrain. I asked Battalion Commander Zhao Haiyun:

"How far is it from the Communist army's outpost?"

"At most half a mile."

"Isn't it dangerous?" I asked like a complete scholar.

"They don't dare—the Communist army comes out at night."

Parachutes Deployed - Supplying the Garrison

Back in Jiangyan, it was already 3 p.m. After resting for a while, when we were preparing to return to Taixian, a bomber flew over the sky, circling slowly, seemingly looking for a target. We had seen airplanes a lot, so we didn't pay attention to it at all. Suddenly, there was an exclamation all around: "Dropping bombs"! People shouted and ran. I was also taken aback. Looking up, several parachutes were floating in the sky, swaying as they descended. "It doesn't look like a bomb," I thought instinctively. "Bombs shouldn't be dropped here." But if it's not a bomb, it shouldn't be dropped here either. I thought again, "The plane must have mistaken the place."

The things dropped by the parachutes did not explode. "The plane probably mistook Jiangyan for Haian. The besieged garrison in Haian needs supplies." I thought further.

However, the plane did not realize its mistake. It continued to drop parachutes one after another, like lotus flowers. The villagers had never seen this thing before and rushed to the fields to search for it. Wu Zhifen, the commander of the 324th Regiment, ordered that all the dropped items be concentrated at the regimental headquarters for disposal.

At dusk, we surrounded Taixian. The brigade had contacted the air force and proved that the batch of things was to supply the garrison in Haian.

Although the siege of Haian has not been completely lifted, and the Communist army in other places is still harassing everywhere, the dangerous period on the wings of northern Jiangsu has passed after the National army's redeployment. The army and people of northern Jiangsu have faith. "Where did the New Fourth Army come from? Beat it back to where it came from!" A wild child adapted the song and sang it. The Mid-Autumn Festival is coming! "The round moon shines on all of China, some families are happy and some are sad?" The restaurants in Taixian started to prepare two days ago to enjoy this poetic and picturesque festival, but the displaced people have no home to return to, and look sadly at the bright moon, adding a lot of new sorrows!

### Appeal of the Wuxi Knitting Industry

Editor: The industry in my city of Wuxi has always been known for its development and is known as "Little Shanghai". The knitting industry in Wuxi also had a glorious history in the past, but since the victory, due to the dumping of foreign goods, the business has been in a slump. Especially due to the lack of working capital, it has had to borrow high-interest loans, and has fallen into a difficult struggle. We should ask the government to allocate industrial loans as soon as possible to alleviate the difficulties. Recently, I read in the newspaper that the Shanghai Branch of the China Production Promotion Association has organized an industrial loan syndicate to provide relief to small and medium-sized factories. I hope that it can be realized as soon as possible, expand the scope of loans, and handle it fairly, so as to meet the actual situation and be universally effective. Also, the China Textile Corporation has always supplied yarn, but it has not yet sold it to the knitting industry in our city, which uses the most yarn. I hope that it will be implemented quickly to reduce costs and compete in the market. (Wuxi County Knitting Industry Association)

### Be Careful Not to Buy Fake Quining Pills

To the Shanghai Declaration and the health departments of all provinces of the Central Health Administration: This year, Shuangtao Quining Pills are very expensive. General speculators only know how to make profits, regardless of the lives of patients, and openly manufacture and sell fake pills for profit. The content of the pills is not up to standard, and some are even made entirely of powder, with not a bit of Quining in them. General informal pharmacies, general merchandise stores, and pharmacies in the interior all purchase them from vendors and sell them at the price of genuine brands, and the ignorant villagers cannot distinguish between genuine and fake, buy and take them, and they are ineffective, so that the genuine products also lose credibility. Selling and manufacturing counterfeit medicines in this way harms patients and misleads lives, which is really unforgivable. I hereby request your department to strictly order your subordinates to investigate and seize them, so as to warn evil people and emphasize hygiene. Very fortunate! (Doctor Yu Rubing)

### Using Vacant Land to Build a Vegetable Market

At the intersection of Dihua Middle Road and Wuyuan Road in western Shanghai, there are vegetable stalls along the road, and the wheels of vehicles come and go, which is very inconvenient. In recent years, the population has been large, and residents are overcrowded when buying vegetables. In addition, the road is a major thoroughfare, and cars often encounter dangerous situations, and residents are very cautious when traveling back and forth. I think it would be better to build a temporary vegetable market on the large vacant land at the intersection of Linsen Road and Fuxing West Road in the east, using wooden boards, in the style of Nanshi South District Street. This equipment does not cost much, and you can also charge stall rental fees. Moreover, the land has been vacant for a long time, which can also avoid the accumulation of garbage, which is also beneficial to hygiene. It is said that the land was owned by the enemy and puppets, so I hereby suggest to the authorities that if it can be adopted, it will be beneficial to traffic safety and public health. (Wang Shaofu)

### Property Registration Certificate Fee is Too Large

The Shanghai County Government has transferred and registered land property rights because the county was occupied for eight years, and land property rights have been sold or transferred for the convenience of collection. Our office is in the county, but because the Huangpu River is separated, it is very inconvenient to travel back and forth (the county government is located in Minhang, west of the Huangpu River, while the fourth and fifth districts are located east of the Huangpu River). A special commissioner was sent to the district office to handle the matter, saving the villagers from traveling back and forth. The law is good and the intention is beautiful, but the handling fee is as high as 6,800 yuan per mu. And each room is calculated as one mu, and the houses in the town are calculated as two mu. The price is really unexpected? I heard that Chuansha County only charges 500 yuan per mu. Why is the difference more than ten times? (Hu Zhifu, Chenxing Town)

### Why Obstruct the Sale of Purchase Vouchers

Editor: We are promoting the purchase of national products market vouchers for education loans. We are all students, but this time we are not sent out by the school, but we are automatically sent out by our Three People's Principles Youth League. We hold the principle of contributing money and effort, so we have no complaints. On the evening of August 30, when we went to St. Taylor's in Central Tibet Road, the person in charge inside did not allow us to enter to promote national product vouchers. May I ask why he was not allowed to enter for promotion? May I ask if he is Chinese? We go out and run around in such hot weather to promote national product vouchers. What is it for? Is it for our own private interests? You must know that we are for the country, for the poor students, and not promoting to his employees, but promoting to customers who are eating coffee in their seats. Are they people without blood? Even their own motherland does not care, and asked us to go outside, and asked us to sign. We signed the Youth League and what school do we want? May I ask what they mean. They said: "You come in a class every three to five minutes, and you come in a class every three to five minutes, which is hindering our business." That's not true. Is it that we are happy to mess with your St. Taylor's and abandon the country for our own private interests? Besides, we did not hinder their business in any way. I hope that in the future, we will have less of this selfish and self-interested heart, and that this kind of phenomenon will no longer occur. Sincerely, the Third Fundraising Team of National Product Vouchers.

### Letters from Su Pu Take Nine Days to Arrive

Editor: This time, my friend went to Su, and I asked him to write to me immediately after arriving in Su, but there has been no news. I thought that my friend had broken his promise, but I did not receive my friend's letter until the 3rd of this month. Looking at the date of sending the letter again, it was August 25. In the past, letters from friends on the Beijing-Shanghai Line only took three days, and Shanghai to Pudong only took two days. Now it takes three days from Shanghai to Pudong, and it takes nine days for letters from Suzhou to Pudong. I hope that the postal authorities will improve it as soon as possible. (Chen Ping)

### Discussing Knitting

— Huang Peiying

Knitted garments made of woolen yarn are exceptionally light, warm, and comfortable to wear, making them very popular. It seems everyone has one, so the knitting industry has a broad scope of activity and a bright future. Twenty years ago, I developed a strong interest in knitting. At that time, in addition to thoroughly studying various domestic knitting methods, I further researched Japanese knitting methods and gained some insights. Consequently, in 1928, I established a knitting training center and provided novel knitting methods along with knitting tools. Many people came to learn at the time, and the products were very well-received. The products were displayed at the Ministry of Industry and Commerce’s National Goods Exhibition and received a special-grade award and a gold medal. Later, due to the slow pace of handmade products, I referred to the needle machines used by the Japanese and invented and improved them, making the products three times faster than by hand. This type of needle machine was named the Woolen Yarn Knitting Machine and was granted a patent by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce of the National Government, obtaining a patent license. It was widely promoted at the time, but since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, this type of needle machine could not continue to be manufactured. Although there were plans to manufacture it after the victory, due to various reasons, it has not yet been able to meet readers this year, which I deeply regret.

However, hand knitting only requires carrying a needle and thread and can be worked on anytime, anywhere, which has its own convenience. The styles and knitting methods are constantly changing, and I intend to explore them with readers in this publication.

### How to Knit a Woolen Sweater? Two Latest Styles

— Ying

Please look at Ms. Yan Huizhu, the queen of Peking opera. See how elegant and dignified she looks wearing this latest style woolen sweater, very beautiful and graceful.

Tools: Two Peiying No. 9 knitting needles, one sewing needle.

Materials: Two skeins of Shuang Mao (Double Cat) brand dark red, ten skeins of blue.

Stitches: Six stitches per pattern repeat.

Knitting method: Cast on 160 stitches, using a crossover pattern, knit to a height of six inches. Then knit one inch high in dark red, alternating one knit stitch and one purl stitch. At this time, decrease 52 stitches on each side using the decreasing method in Practice Diagram 10 (for the pocket opening). Separately cast on 48 stitches using two knitting needles, knit in stockinette stitch to a height of six inches, and knit two pieces in the same way (for the pocket flaps). Now connect these two pieces to the decreased sides, still using blue and the original pattern. Afterwards, decrease one stitch on each side every half inch, for a total of 22 stitches decreased. Continue to increase one stitch on each side every half inch, for a total of 32 stitches increased. At this time, start decreasing for the armholes, decreasing one stitch on each side every other row, for a total of 40 stitches decreased. Continue to increase one stitch on each side every other row, putting back the 40 stitches that were decreased (but starting from when the increase stitches, knit two inches high. At this time, decrease the neckline in the middle, first leaving 30 stitches in the center with a needle, now knit each side separately, leaving one stitch at the neckline on each row, until the number of stitches is sufficient at the armhole. The other side is the same).

Back piece knitting method: Cast on 86 stitches, knit eight stitches in alternating knit and purl on one side, the rest still knit in the same pattern as the front piece, to a height of five inches. Continue to decrease one stitch every half inch on the side that is not knitting alternating knit and purl, for a total of 15 stitches decreased. Continue to increase one stitch every half inch on the decreased side, for a total of 15 stitches increased. Then decrease the armholes in the same way as the front piece, to the same height. The knitting method for the other half of the back piece is the same (but on the edge where eight stitches are knitted in alternating knit and purl, a buttonhole must be made every three inches (i.e., increase one stitch, decrease one stitch)). After the front and back pieces are knitted, sew the front and back pieces together using the seam joining method in the back diagram.

Neckline knitting method: Use dark red to knit two inches high in alternating knit and purl for the stitches left around the neckline, then cast off, and sew the one-inch height to the reverse side to make it a double layer.

Armhole edge knitting method: Pick up one stitch in each hole around the armhole, for a total of 140 stitches, knit one inch high in alternating knit and purl (using dark red), the other side is the same.

Belt knitting method: Cast on 13 stitches with dark red, knit alternating knit and purl, to a height of 22 inches. Then decrease one stitch on each side every row, until finished, making it into a pointed end, the other one is the same. After knitting, sew it to both sides of the waist on the front piece.

There is also a latest 1946 woolen sweater. Its style is taken from this year’s American clothing samples. When worn by Ms. Tong Zhiling, a famous Kunqu opera actress, it looks even more beautiful and lively.

Tools: Two Peiying No. 9 knitting needles, one sewing needle.

Materials: Thirteen skeins of Bian Mao (Transforming Cat) brand four-ply wool yarn.

Knitting method: Cast on 150 stitches, using the same pattern as the back, but decreasing one stitch on each side every half inch, for a total of 40 stitches decreased. Continue to increase one stitch on each side every half inch, for a total of 32 stitches increased. At this time, start decreasing for the armholes, decreasing one stitch on each side every other row, for a total of 32 stitches decreased, continue knitting at same width until four inches high.

Front piece knitting method: Cast on 80 stitches, reduce by one stitch every half-inch on the back side, for a total of 20 stitches decreased. (But when the knit reaches 2 inches high, knit 16 stitches away on the side without decreasing stitches, from the 17th stitch knit 44 stitches two knit stitches and two purl stitches, measure one inch high, then these 44 stitches use practice chart 10 method cast off, this is the pocket opening.) Use two needles to knit 44 stitches to six inches in height, then connect them in the middle of the pocket opening where 44 stitches were cast off, and knit together with the original flower. After decreasing the 20 stitches on one side, continue to add one stitch every half stitch, for a total of 16 stitches added. At this time, armhole stitches should be cast off. Replace the flower pattern to cast off neckline stitches, decrease one stitch every three rows on the flat surface that is not increasing or decreasing, for a total of 20 stitches decreased, for the neckline. (But it must be decreased from the 11th stitch, because those ten stitches are the edge in the center. Refer to the back diagram for the flower-style knotting method.) Decrease one stitch every other row for the armhole, for a total of 16 stitches decreased, knit to the same height as the back piece. The knitting method for the other side is the same, but only the ten stitches on the front must be knitted five and a half inches longer, because there is no edge on the neckline of the back piece. When these ten stitches are knitted to five and a half inches long, sew them together with the ten stitches on the front of the other side. For the remaining stitches, the front and back pieces can be sewn together using the seam joining method in the back diagram.

Sleeve knitting method: Cast on 50 stitches, still knit the moss stitch, then add one stitch on each side every other row, for a total of 50 stitches added. Continue to knit 11 inches high without increasing or decreasing. Then in one row, decrease 40 stitches in the middle. (i.e., decrease one stitch, decrease one stitch, one purl stitch, and so on.) Leaving 60 stitches out of 100 stitches, continue to knit 3 and a half inches high with two knit stitches and one purl stitch, the knitting method for the other sleeve is the same. When sewing on the clothes, if the top of the sleeve is too big, it can be slightly puffed up on the shoulder blades.

Belt knitting method: Cast on nine stitches, knit the moss stitch to 28 inches high. Continue to decrease one stitch on each side every other row until finished, making it into a pointed end.

After the clothes are completely knitted, embroider any kind of embroidery pattern you like on the left side of the front piece, and the color scheme can also be as you like.

### Washing and Preservation of Woolen Products

— Pei

Before discussing the washing method of woolen products, we should first know the characteristics of wool. The main component of wool, the fiber, has so-called outer scales, which must not be rubbed vigorously. If rubbed too vigorously, the fluff on the woolen yarn will form clumps, losing its original beauty. Woolen yarn has a very weak alkaline reaction, so high-quality soap must be used when washing, otherwise, the woolen yarn will easily become hard. If it is colored woolen yarn, and there is a possibility of fading when washing, the color must be fixed before washing. The method of fixing the color is to put one teaspoon of tannic acid and one teaspoon of acetic acid in one liter of clear water, mix them, put the item to be washed in and soak for five to six minutes, and then wash it.

Washing method: The washing method, the first thing to do is to remove the dirt, so rinse the detergent with clear water. After washing three or four times, put it in the soap water and push it up and down and left and right. After that, rinse with clear water and then use the sour wash method. The sour wash method has the effect of protecting the luster of the wool and preventing the wool from being damaged, so the sour wash method must be applied to woolen products at the end of washing. The method of sour washing is very simple. Half a glass of acetic acid or two glasses of ordinary sour vinegar can be put in one liter of clear water to make sour-tasting water. Put the washed item in and soak for five or six minutes, then take it out and dry it.

Drying method: The drying method cannot squeeze dry vigorously like other things. After sour washing, take it out and put it on a flat board to flatten it, then flatten the shape, and then slant the board and dry it in the shade to keep the item's original beauty.

Preservation method: As for the method of preservation, the most important thing is to prevent insect damage, and do not let the item change color and deteriorate. The first method of insect prevention is to completely wash off the stains before storing them, so that it can take effect. At the same time, the washed items must be fully dried and must be placed in a dry place. When storing, each item should be wrapped in paper separately, and camphor or mothballs should be placed in the middle, and they must be put in thin paper bags so that the powder of camphor etc. is not easily removed from the seams. After wrapping it up like this, put it in a cabinet or box, and then put the box in a dry, shady place, and do not let the sun shine directly on it, so that it can prevent discoloration and deterioration.

### Mother Comes First

— Yinguo

The "Women's Liberation" movement of the past decade or so has indeed had some women doing things that benefit the crowd, no less than men. But unfortunately, most women, especially those in cities, after being "liberated," not only still live a life of dependence, but even refuse to be as submissive as before, and only know how to enjoy rights without wanting to fulfill obligations, and have even broken the concept of "virtuous wife and good mother."

Children are the cornerstone of future society and the pillars of the nation. If we want to make the future country and society more perfect, we must do our best to develop children's education.

The education that children receive in schools is mechanical and limited, and teachers cannot follow students all day long to teach them at any time. Therefore, parents and teachers should bear equal responsibility for the education of children in their childhood. In school, it is up to the teachers, and in the home, it should be up to the parents. Especially mothers, because children have more frequent contact with their mothers than their fathers, there is no doubt that children's will and temperament follow the teachings and instructions of their mothers. In the corners of the city, it is easy to see that when a mother is preoccupied with gambling or playing outside all day, they easily give their children money and hand over the responsibility of care to servants, or let the children associate with the dregs of society. Of course, "one who stays near vermilion gets stained red, and one who stays near ink gets stained black." The children will learn everything: gambling, cursing...

Educating a child is like cultivating a flower or plant. If it is cared for by a diligent gardener who loves and plants it, it will always flourish. On the contrary, if it encounters a lazy gardener who lets it be exposed to the sun and rain without pruning its branches, there is no doubt that the flower or plant will wither.

Looking at the world's great people, their success has almost all been influenced by their mothers' hard work and teaching, because they can use their powers of observation to discern the psychology of children, grasp their emotions, and instill pure thoughts to nurture and correct them.

Of course, not every mother in the world can teach her children to become great people, but at least don't raise parasites that are of no use to society, the community, or the country.

May the mothers of the world take on this great responsibility!

### Reasoning with Children

— Yimin

(1) It's Not Just Like Roses

In my grandmother's garden there was a rose, which had already developed buds, but would not bloom for many days. This made me feel very anxious, because I was eager to see its beautiful petals and colors. I prepared to help it and asked it to bloom. With my grandmother's permission, I unfolded its petals one by one. Finally, the rose seemed to bloom, but it was not as beautiful and moving as I had seen before. Undoubtedly, the inherent beauty of this rose was destroyed by me, and it quickly withered and died. When my grandmother saw it, she said to me gently, "Everything is like this. Roses can only produce beautiful flowers in a certain order and at a certain time."

(2) The Lesson of the Basket

The six children in our family always liked to talk about other people's private affairs, gossip, and hurt others without benefiting themselves. Our father hated this bad habit. One day he brought back a package and said, "I bought each of you a small basket. When you have something to talk about, record it and put it in your basket. After the basket is full, check them one by one to see how much meaning there is." At first, we thought this was a ridiculous job, but soon we were very careful about what we said, and after a while, we simply forgot this bad habit of talking about others. Later, my father explained: "This little basket has acted as your monitor. Now you will no longer bring unfounded rumors from school, office, or factory to harm others. Although your basket is empty, it is more meaningful than when it was full."

### A Good Wife

— Translated by Gangren

No matter what you think; You are not the good wife you should be if:——

You tell your friends: "It's so annoying! My husband he..."

You dress up more carefully when you go out alone to a party than when your husband accompanies you to the movies.

You prefer to tell your husband how hard you have worked all day, rather than tell him how these work experiences have increased your pleasure.

When you want to chat with your friends, you leave your husband and family unattended.

You tell your husband the bad news at dinner, and not when you know your husband is in a good mood.

You are never satisfied with the house you live in and always want new things to make it more beautiful.

You decorate your "home" well, and seem to value your friends' praise more than the comfort your husband gets from it.

You have no interest in entertaining your husband's friends.

You would rather choose your own gifts than risk that he might buy you something you don't like.

You often say, "I want my husband to do this and that," instead of saying, "I hope he can do this and that, if he wants to."

You never let your husband be trusted with a certain opinion, until he has done it well.

You never ask your husband's opinion on anything. (Originally published in The China Pre)

### How to Manage Servants

— Yuan

Any housewife in charge of a household must supervise her servants and maids at all times and see if their measures and actions are appropriate, and must not neglect them. The method of supervision should be based on common sense, and then when giving orders, one can be sure to act appropriately, so that the servants will obediently follow the rules and not act beyond the norm. The following are some points that housewives should be aware of. Readers should ponder them carefully and supplement them with experience, so that they can be handy and achieve the wonderful effect of commanding at will!

When selecting servants, only ask for diligence and simplicity, and be sure to examine their temperament to see if they can obey the master's orders. Do not judge solely on the basis of the level of wages. For sincere servants, diligent service is of no small benefit to the master, and it is appropriate for them to demand a good price. As for those who are lazy and undisciplined, who steal leisure and love ease, or who are stubborn and difficult to tame, even if the wages are low, the gains and losses will not be enough to offset them. Therefore, good servants are those who are diligent and thrifty, and who have a warm temperament and no heart of arrogance or flirtation. Conversely, management is not easy, and even if they have long skills, it is not appropriate to hire them, lest there be future troubles.

For people living at home, clothing and utensils should be clean and tidy, and so should servants. Gorgeousness is not appropriate, and damage and dirt also detract from elegance. Clothes are dirty and worn, not necessarily because of poverty, but mostly because of laziness and the unwillingness to wash and mend them. As the saying goes, "The work of one stitch, if sewn in time, is enough to save the labor of nine stitches." If servants do not know how to clean themselves, how can they be expected to be diligent in other things? It is like climbing a tree to catch fish, which is definitely impossible. As for flaunting clothes and dressing up, servants imitating their mistresses is also not appropriate. Those who are in charge should persuade them step by step, teach them to save, explain the advantages and disadvantages, so as to block their extravagant habits, and tell them that the amount of money earned by labor is very small. Regardless of whether it is blood and sweat, it should not be wasted at will. And those who make a living by labor sometimes stop working, or they may become old and sick and suddenly suffer from illness, and in every case, money is needed for support. If they do not save up on weekdays, when things happen, what can they rely on in a hurry? In short, all those who work for a living must be diligent and thrifty, and must not pursue extravagance. If clothes are torn, they should be mended, and must not be thrown away. The mouth and stomach cannot be indulged. As for shopping and socializing, they must also be restrained everywhere to save money and effort. As the old saying goes, "Saving a penny is like earning a penny." Otherwise, indulgence will never be satisfied, and one will inevitably fall into extravagance, and when the money is exhausted, one will have bad thoughts, and when one reaches the end of the road, it will be too late to regret the mistake!

The duties that servants should fulfill are numerous and cannot be enumerated one by one, such as cooking, washing, sweeping, and arranging utensils, and caring for young children. All of these are within their duties, but cooking and washing each have their own special duties, which cannot be fully covered by a brief list. Moreover, in wealthy families, there are many servants, and there are often cooks and women who each specialize in their work. Even if this is not the case, those in charge must also divide the work and cannot entrust it to one person alone. However, sweeping the house and tidying up utensils are usually the duties of servants. Now let us discuss them as follows:

Get up at dawn, open the windows and doors wide, and roll up the curtains to let fresh air into the room. If it is winter, and there is a stove in the room, the ashes and remaining charcoal must be removed first, and then sweep the room. When removing the ashes, the technique should be gentle, and the gold and porcelain items in the room, as well as the chairs and walls, should be covered with cloth to prevent dust from flying around. When sweeping the floor, first moisten it with water, which can also reduce the flying of dust. After sweeping, wipe the windows, and all glass cabinets and frames, as well as mirror frames, must be wiped. If there are copper or steel items, they should be wiped with soft leather to prevent them from rusting. If rust spots are seen, sandpaper or glue ash must be used to grind them, and they must be smoothed before stopping. Other items such as tables, chairs, and frames must be wiped one by one to prevent stains from remaining. All of these things should be done before the master gets up. Once the master gets up, the bedroom must be tidied up, the mattresses spread out, and the room swept and wiped as before.

If there are vases or water-filled basins in the room, they must be emptied and refilled with clear water every day.

Every few days, the quilts and mattresses should be taken out and exposed to the sunlight. Other things such as sweeping the stairs or beating the carpets must be done on sunny days and when there is free time, so as not to annoy the master. By the time it is evening, the windows and doors must be locked, and do not be lazy or forgetful, which is also the duty of servants.

Although the above discussion is only a brief outline, it must be guided properly in order to enjoy its effect. If there are any mistakes, they must be persuaded gently and shown kindness, so that the servants will return with gratitude and be sincerely convinced. Otherwise, even if you spend a lot of money, you will not be able to buy their loyalty, which is not the best policy.

### Save the Unfortunate Children Made by Man

— Chen Xin

There are many unfortunate children in China. They are those who have experienced natural and man-made disasters, lost their parents at an early age, and some who have been abandoned and are wandering around. These unfortunate children should receive widespread sympathy from people.

But people have not noticed that in addition to these unfortunate children, there are more unfortunate children made by man. That is, when the fathers or mothers of children have affairs, the unfortunate fate of the children begins. In the current semi-feudal society, there are not many women who are mothers who have affairs, but it is more common for men.

My former ideal was that a sound marriage could definitely establish a happy family, so that the new generation would also be happy and excellent. But reality shattered my ideal. I have personally seen that among friends and relatives, they had a long and sweet courtship in the past, and their temperaments could not be said to be unknown to each other, and they were both intellectuals serving society. But after marriage, even ten or twenty years later, when the "green shade becomes a family tree full of branches", the hardworking mother is old and aging; but the father's career is gradually heading towards success. Generally, men who are fickle, when they have status and money, they get a concubine or mistress. They only see the new people smile, but they do not hear the old people cry. They never care about the destruction of family happiness, and they will not experience or imagine the psychological impact on the children, because they are becoming more and more alienated from the children.

Chinese women who have always been subjected to traditional etiquette and morality, even if they have been baptized by new ideas, they will never casually shout out divorce. When she is subjected to this unexpected blow, the gentle ones will silently entrust their hope and love to the next generation. However, this broken heart that has been stimulated will sometimes become perverted and unreasonably vent on the children, beating, scolding, and even ignoring them. And the children, facing this family shrouded in haze, their innocent and fragile hearts feel inexplicable hatred and jealousy. They cannot get the warmth of home, and they lose the great paternal love. Their young hearts are being devastated.

If the mother has a fierce and irritable temperament, she will definitely quarrel with her husband, and because of using revenge, she will wander outside all day, using theaters and dance halls to numb her heart that has lost its joy. As a result, these "fatherless and motherless" children are not well-fed and often suffer in winter. Besides messing around in the alley all day long, they simply no longer have a home. When they can occasionally see their parents, it is either a cold face like ice or fighting and quarreling. Under such family education, the spiritual and material education that children receive is perhaps even worse than that of orphans without parents.

If we want to educate an excellent second generation, we must hold fathers accountable for the majority of the responsibilities they should fulfill. Fathers should restrain their selfish lust and irrigate the newborn seedlings with great paternal love. I also hope that every woman can respect her own personality, strengthen your rationality, do not be seduced by men, being a concubine is dishonorable and lowly, without legal protection, and is despised by women of the new era. Moreover, destroying other people's families and harming the second generation of new China, you are committing crimes that harm society and the people!

We must save these unfortunate children!

### Goethe's Later Years

— Mai Fo

Thomas Mann and "The Return of the Lover"

In the history of world literature, there is no greater giant than Goethe in terms of literary talent. For Chinese readers, everyone remembers his masterpiece "The Sorrows of Young Werther." This is an autobiographical novel of his, which, upon publication, was widely sought after, and many lovelorn youths committed suicide with a copy of "The Sorrows of Young Werther" in their hands.

In the spring of 1772, at the young age of twenty-two, the young Goethe went to Wetzlar, a town in central Germany, to practice law at the Imperial Court. At the age of sixteen, he left his hometown of Frankfurt and studied law in Leipzig and Strasbourg, during which time he fell ill and stayed at home. During his time in Leipzig, he fell in love with Käthchen Schönkopf, and during his time in Strasbourg, he was passionately in love with Friederike Brion, both of which ended in separation. These formed the model for Goethe's early love affairs, separations, and regrets. Now Goethe arrived in Wetzlar with a large number of poems, plays, sketches, and drafts in his possession, his mind full of ideals, ambitions, and illusions, and his heart full with pure passion, rebellion, and youthful melancholy. He had just finished writing his first play: "Götz von Berlichingen."

At the Imperial Court, Goethe met his former classmate Kestner, and through him, he met his fiancée Charlotte Buff, who was the housekeeper for her father and many siblings. The scene of their meeting, as written in "The Sorrows of Young Werther," was later versified by the British humorist Thackeray:

Werther loved Charlotte,
Words can never tell;
How you know he first met her?
She was cutting bread and butter.

But in real life, that meeting
was at a country dance.
Seventeen-year-old young Lotte,
wearing a white dress, trimmed with pale pink silk knots.
Thus the three of them, Goethe, Kestner and Lotte, spent an idyllic summer, Goethe initially yearning for the common love of friends, and later finally falling in love with Lotte alone, and finally falling in love with his own feelings as a poet and a lover. In the autumn, after receiving gentle advice from the other party, he abruptly retreated from the happiness at hand once again. Kestner and Lotte married, and soon after, a tragedy occurred in Wetzlar: another classmate, Jerusalem, committed suicide by shooting himself because of unrequited love. The effect of this foolish incident on Goethe was that he combined it with his own recent emotions, resulting in the novel "The Sorrows of Young Werther." After its publication, all of Europe was thrown into turmoil, and Goethe became famous as a result.

Forty-four years passed, and Goethe lived in seclusion in Weimar. Thackeray wrote another limerick in his famous work "Vanity Fair." But at this time, Goethe was already a great poet, playwright, novelist, politician, scientist, lover, privy councillor... His statue was placed alongside those of Napoleon and Beethoven; his house was a sacred place that pilgrims from all over the world must visit. He was, and still is, the greatest figure in Germany. His writings are vast, and his complete published works total forty volumes: plays, novels, poems, criticisms—almost every literary form. He wrote the most beautiful lyric poems in literature, and he wrote "Faust," a work to which he devoted his entire life. Even so, he still felt that he had not fully expressed himself.

And what about Charlotte—the female protagonist of "The Sorrows of Young Werther"—at that time? In contrast to Goethe's fame, she was unknown. She bore eleven children for her good husband, several of whom died young, and now she had been a widow for many years. When she was spending her old age in her sixties, she also led her children to the holy land.

This is the beginning of the story "The Return of the Lover" by the deceased writer Thomas Mann. Lotte, an old widow in her sixties, with gray hair and a stout body, went to Weimar Temple with a daughter close to thirty years old. Although her face was completely changed, she still carried in her suitcase the self-colored robe with pink silk knots that she wore when she first met Goethe.

When she got out of the carriage and signed her name in the guest book of the White Elephant Hotel, she immediately attracted the attention of the head waiter, Mag: "Could this be Charlotte of the Buff family in Wetzlar?" He had already read "The Sorrows of Young Werther" thoroughly, and today seeing the heroine of the book, he was naturally fortunate. The news spread, and the hotel was surrounded by crowds admiring her demeanor.

Charlotte sent her daughter to her sister's house, and wrote a letter to Goethe, the words of which she had already rehearsed: My glorious friend:

I have come to visit my sister with my daughter Charlotte and will be staying in Weimar for a few days. It is my hope to introduce my daughter to you. As for myself, if I can meet again with my old companion, who is now world-renowned, I will be overjoyed.

Weimar, White Elephant Hotel, October 6, 1816.

Charlotte Kestner.

The next day, Goethe invited her to a banquet. Charlotte wore the white robe with red silk knots and sat next to Goethe. She could not speak. Although she was a vulgar woman, who had come only to say a few words to Goethe on behalf of her brother-in-law, at this moment, she could not speak.

The entire book has nine chapters, with more than one hundred thousand words; it is about two days, so what is written is all about the psychological states of Charlotte and Goethe. The reunion of a giant of a generation with an old love in his later years was just this ordinary meal!

### The Night Watchman

— Xu Zhen

How does one while away the lonely long night! You ask, let me listen to the sound of the clapper, and then tell you:

When the venomous serpent of insomnia unveils the curtain of your heart, then, accompanying the mumbling of dreamers, the night watchman is your closest friend in the world.

A lamp traces a blurred shadow, a stick shatters the deathly silence of the night; forgetting the desire for "life," he knocks sweetness into the clapper; his simple, dull sound of the clapper spreads its wings, sweeping away the stars of the day; the fierce dogs in the alley seem to be kind to him, knowing that he is the messenger who urges people to have sweet dreams. But has a clever person explained "the greater self" and "the lesser self" to him? Has conscience told him about "selfishness" and "altruism"? Who does not love sweet dreams, who does not pity themselves? For whom should he be wandering in the night? Yet he silently bears the cross. Is this the reason why people can know him? Or is it what Providence can guess? Like casting off all the burdens of the mortal world, is this fate? Or does he still want to be the drummer of the times?

The perfect dream, although cherished by you, is only for him to squander with a clapper; the pain of insomnia, although you hate it, is ultimately brought back by the sound of the clapper. You often think he is foolish, but who in the world is not foolish? Even with regard to the arrangements of the Creator, or even one's own emotions and intellect.

In a foreign land or a place far from home, hearing the sound of the clapper, one almost feels as if one is in the small building of one's family. I love this sound of the clapper, which makes you feel longing from yearning. I cannot touch it, but I know that I am gradually approaching it.

### Praise for a Portrait of an Orphan Girl

— Xie Zi

What is painted here is a fifteen- or sixteen-year-old girl. Whether she is an orphan, I do not know, but I think it is very appropriate to call her an orphan. She must not have parents, otherwise she would never have lost the radiance of youth at such a young age. She is not beautiful, her expression is also dull, and even the backdrop and tone that set her off are a bit dark; but overall, this painting is very successful, giving us a very deep impression and making us feel a deep sadness. This kind of sadness can be intimately experienced by anyone who has lived in emotion and reflected on life. Moreover, when we gaze at this painting, our expression should be the same as that of this orphan girl, a kind of blank sadness.

Her hair is disheveled, her face is also very haggard, and in her eyes, one can see a kind of hazy darkness—she is a pitiful person. Obviously, she has given up the pursuit of beauty; this pursuit, perhaps she has never been aware of in her suffering life, or perhaps she has gradually given up in the face of constant blows and disappointments. Because every girl, regardless of ugliness or beauty, always hopes to express herself beautifully; but she does not have this hope, her facial expression is lax, her demeanor is too dim, and her eyes are already like those of a person who has experienced suffering, inclined to reflection and introspection. Such people can be said to be everywhere in our era, but until we saw this painting, we began to be surprised: we had not observed them deeply.

Youth is beautiful, but not many people can enjoy youth. Those who obtain youth do not realize it; by the time they realize it, youth has already slipped away in suffering. I once saw a painting in which the face of a wrinkled woman was faintly drawn in the ripples of water, with the title "Fleeting Time"—fleeting time, this girl who is only fifteen or sixteen years old has already lost the radiance of her soul. Could it be that in our suffering era, a dozen years have actually been worth forty or fifty years of a peaceful era!

Da Vinci's "Mona Lisa" is a happy picture, in which we see a kind of joy of the soul; this joy is almost divine. But how many people can obtain this kind of joy? We all have our own dreams. In normal life, we realize these dreams; in adverse circumstances, we pursue them. But this lonely girl, her dreams seem to have been shattered. She must have cried sadly in suffering, and resented violently in disappointment. Now, everything is calm and quiet, she stares blankly—this is just a deep silence.

My love for this painting is a love for its subtlety and depth. Usually during the New Year, we can see many red and green figure paintings on the market. The colors of these paintings are very exaggerated, and the figures are also very numerous. For children, this is something lovely; for country people who grew up in a peaceful era, this is also very interesting. But in our opinion, it always feels like there is no life, no content, just some images floating on the paper. But if you open up this painting here and take a look, it reveals a suffering era, and also reveals a turbulent life!

For a teenage girl, life should be easy, but it is not. She is already disappointed. She has not received a higher education, and no one has guided her to transform this depression into the pursuit of a higher ideal. She only hopes to obtain a normal life, a normal life at the most basic level. She only hopes to obtain a little bit of the most ordinary warmth. But even this little hope cannot be obtained, so she is disappointed. This disappointment represents the endurance of all mankind towards life.

Finally, I am surprised that the author of this painting has such profound observational skills. She is always happy on weekdays. I thought she must not know what depression is. I thought her understanding of life must be superficial; but I was wrong, her observational skills are much deeper than ours, and her expressive techniques are so skilled. This shows that a person's daily expression does not necessarily represent his inner self. In this complex era, life is multifaceted after all.

### To My Eldest Daughter

— Dai Wangshu

Remember those happy days!

Daughter, remember in your young heart:

Your childhood was adorned with the colorful feathers of seabirds,
The pearly color of shells, the clear sound of tides,
The verdant green of mountain mists, the embroidered tapestry of flowers,
And the tenderness of your loving parents.

We once had a comfortable home,
Surrounded by the gurgling sound of spring water,
Basking in the sun in winter, shrouded in shade in summer,
Having friends during the day, and tranquility at night,
The years flowed outside the window, not disturbing
The joy that stayed in the house all year round,
If people glimpsed us talking and laughing under the lamp,
They would feel that it was worth living a lifetime just for this.

We once had a seaside garden,
It gave us nourishing tomatoes and golden bamboo shoots,
Your father would till the land when he was tired of reading,
Your mother would sew in the shade of the sun,
And you, you would chase butterflies in the grass,
Then seek tender dreams in a gentle embrace.

Everyone said we were the happiest,
Perhaps because we lived so foolishly,
Perhaps because your mother was gentle and beautiful,
Perhaps because your father's poems were the freshest.

But, daughter, that happiness was short-lived,
In an instant, it was all locked and buried in clouds and smoke;
You remember that our little garden faced the sea,
From there, you left and never returned,
Since then, I have been facing that distant horizon,
Often lingering under the pine trees until dusk.

Those dazzling days, like butterflies,
Now you waste your time groping and chasing,
As if seeing you go from this room of mine
To that room, waving away the shadows with your little hands,
Then, thinking of your father in the distance,
Resting your tired head on a small embroidered pillow.

But, remember those happy days,
Daughter, remember in your young heart:
Your father will still come, as in the past,
To guard your dreams, to guard your waking hours.

### An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of River, An Inch of Blood 42

— Ye Jingfeng

After hastily bidding farewell to Ding Yuan, I returned to the station with the three people who delivered the message, but the news was still shrouded in silence. "Maybe they'll launch tonight?... Maybe tomorrow?" I speculated. Who knew that just as it was about half past eleven, the signal from the radio in the closet sounded.

"Hey, old friend, lunch is ready, just waiting for you alone!"

"Okay, I'll set off right away," I replied.

"Lunch" or "breakfast" or "dinner" or "late night snack" etc., were the agreed-upon code words, referring to the preliminary launch by the Japanese. The meaning of "set off" referred to the sabotage work I was in charge of.

"631, 631, Headquarters," I began to send out the special agent common code telegram. The recipient was the Shenyang General Staff Headquarters. In less than two minutes, there was a response. I knew that the code had been connected, so I quickly sent out the pre-prepared telegram: "Top secret, the planned 'Trilogy' plan has been leaked, and the other party is prepared, 035 branch north." I used the Tianjin Radio code.

This was the cracking method that Wang Lengzhai and I had planned. The Japanese are very clumsy, narrow-minded, and suspicious; therefore, when there is a secret plan, they are most afraid of hearing the word "leak". If they hear that it has been leaked, regardless of whether it is true or false, they will definitely be flustered and cause a commotion; even overturning the entire plan. The cracking method I planned was based on this mentality.

According to my guess, after receiving this urgent telegram, the headquarters must immediately issue an order, instructing the Peiping special agent agency to stop the expected action, or temporarily change the method, or cancel the meeting.

Sure enough, about an hour later, our comrades at headquarters telegraphed, saying that the head of the headquarters was very angry after receiving the urgent telegram, and scolded the Peiping special agent host and the leaders of military and political activities, saying that they were simply bastards, and that even this important plan had been leaked. The responsibility for the leak was placed on Matsui alone. This guy was the idiot who accompanied me back to Changxindian last time.

However, if you say that he is really an idiot, that is not the case. Around six o'clock in the evening, we received intelligence that this guy still remained calm in the afternoon, and at the agreed time, he led Imai and a few other desperadoes, and more than a dozen good shooters, all the way to the Beiping Ji-Cha Committee Chairman's Office of the Jinde Society, on the one hand, to test how much strength was prepared in the Xingyuan, and on the other hand, still intending to do it recklessly. The meaning was that if a few were knocked down, they could also make up for their mistakes.

Who knew that when they arrived at Xingyuan, as soon as they entered the door, all the shooters were stopped. Although they were invited to have tea in the lounge, in reality, they were watched by more than twenty burly men in the guard room. However, this guy Matsui still did not give up, and still led Imai and three or five attendants, rushing to the guest room, specifically demanding that Song Zheyuan personally receive them.

### Serial Pictures

— Shao Fu

There are many stalls on the streets and alleys that rent and sell welcome loop pictures. At each stall, there are often crowds of children, ranging in age from eight or nine to ten years old, and even many adult women. Some people have likened them to street education, but this kind of education is dangerous.

The danger lies in the story content of these comic books.

This statement is based on evidence. Recently, there was a recent example:

At 5:00 AM on the 22nd, a blood case of a younger brother killing his brother and sister-in-law occurred on Beijing Road. The younger sister of the murderer said that the murderer usually liked to read comic books. On the evening before the murder, he was still reading the book "Emerald Screen Mountain." Unexpectedly, he imitated Shi Xiu and killed his brother and sister-in-law. So it may be poisoned by the comic books.

The story content of comic books mostly falls into the three categories of adultery, thieves and monsters, because they are expressed in pictures, and the cost is very low, and the distribution is extensive, so they are more popular and deeply rooted in the people, which has a great impact on society.

For the sake of saving the children, the authorities should actively ban them.

I have talked to the relevant authorities about this issue. According to them, they have long noticed it, but when banning them, the publishers of these books very righteously take out the licenses approved by the Ministry of Interior for registration and printing, which makes us feel quite embarrassed.

If the above is true, in addition to asking the competent authorities of this city to report the facts, we also ask the Ministry of Interior to thoroughly investigate. On what basis can these books and periodicals containing toxins be issued permits? Who is handling this matter? Are there any other circumstances?

Naturally, we also hope that those publishers will not lose their conscience and make this bloody money for killing people!

Scientific Knowledge

### One Day We Will Go to the Moon

— Da Wei

(Editor's note: In today's era when all science is prepared for war, we sincerely hope that scientists can shift their interest in researching atomic bombs and germ warfare to researching the moon!)

To the naked eye, the full moon is just a bright plate with mottled shadows on it. This is the surface of the satellite: there are deserts, plains, mountains, volcanic rocks, valleys and craters. Most of the things commonly seen on Earth are on it, except that there are no lakes, oceans, and living things there.

Astronomers have carefully and accurately drawn the surface of the moon. They know more about the cracks, volcanic rocks, valleys, and plains on it than geographers know about the hidden places on Earth.

They also know about the conditions on the moon. The temperature difference between day and night there is very large. The daytime on the moon is equal to two weeks on Earth. The sun shines directly on the surface, and there is no air layer like on Earth to block it. As a result, the rocks get so hot during the day that they can boil water. Only in caves or in the shade of cliffs is it dark, and humans can live there.

The night on the moon is also two weeks long. The heat from the surface quickly radiates into the air, and the temperature may drop so low that any liquid freezes.

More serious than any difficulty is that there is no air on it. If a person goes from Earth to the moon without any precautions, it is easy to explode due to the air pressure in the body, just like some deep-sea fish come out of the sea too quickly.

To overcome these dangers, moon explorers should have special equipment. They need "moon clothes," a well-designed, completely closed and movable body armor that can supply air at the same pressure like a diving suit, and has other essential equipment for survival on the moon, such as temperature controllers and electrically operated equipment.

A Suit Weighs Seven Hundred Pounds

Such a heavy suit cannot be used on Earth. However, the gravity on the moon is almost only one-fifth of that on Earth. A man weighing one hundred and eighty pounds weighs only thirty-five pounds on the moon. A suit weighing seven hundred pounds on the ground weighs only one hundred and forty pounds on the moon. In order to protect the person, the suit needs to be heavy so that he can maintain balance and control his muscles.

It is hard to say what this seven hundred-pound suit will look like. It should have the strength to withstand an internal pressure of fifteen pounds per square inch. And it must be soft so that the person wearing it can move easily. It must have its own power machinery—perhaps a generator to adapt to the sunlight on the moon during the day and a storage battery for use at night. Its air conditioner must be able to continuously re-manufacture the exhaled air, add fresh oxygen, and then put it into the circulation supplier. It may have to be able to extract the moisture exhaled from the air and evaporated from the body, clean it and then supply it for use, because both water and air must be brought from Earth.

This moon suit must also have internal and external lights for use at night on the moon; and it must have heat insulators, heating and cooling devices for day and night needs. Motors and control devices to operate "arms", "fingers" and other surface working equipment, as well as wireless and radar equipment are for transportation, orientation and drawing. In addition, there must be food storage for the explorer to use when leaving the base, and other devices for health, comfort and convenient work are also essential.

If this kind of clothing can be manufactured (it seems there is no reason why it cannot be), then intelligent and determined explorers can not only survive in the short term, but also thoroughly investigate the moon.

The rocket engine capable of making this kind of moon trip must be at least twice as efficient as all the current ones. The aerial fire must have an amazing speed of seven miles per second, which physicists call the "liberation speed" of the Earth. This means that once the rocket reaches this speed, the engine can be turned off, and the rocket can be powered by the Earth. If aimed accurately, it can be shot to the moon.

What Time to Explore the Moon

The best time for the lunar expedition to reach the moon is in the moon's morning, so that the explorers can have two weeks of sunlight to adapt all their equipment and life to the local environment. The first thing they should do after landing is to prepare the rocket for its return. They can take turns going out to investigate. The driver should be stationed at the base to communicate with the team members who have gone out and the ground. Geologists and mineralogists go out to explore valuable metals and minerals, study the possibility of colonization, and bring back rocks from the moon for further research.

The results of the investigation should be reported to the Earth station immediately, to avoid any accidents that prevent the expedition from returning.

On the second moon day (that is, the 28th day on Earth), they can prepare for the return trip. A speed of seven miles per second must be prepared on the way to go, and only one-fifth of this speed is required when returning, because the "liberation speed" on the moon is one point four miles per second.

According to the above, the moon is a place worth studying. It may become a stronghold for the victors on Earth. It may become the first station in the planetary transportation system in the next century. (Translated from the September issue of Collier's Magazine)

### Ideal Wife and Ideal Husband

— Li Xin

[Editor's Note: In our August 30th issue, we published Mr. Zhi Wei's "My Ideal Wife," outlining his criteria for his future spouse. Many readers responded to this question, and some even requested that their letters be forwarded to Mr. Zhi Wei, demonstrating the pressing interest of young people in matters of marriage. Here, we are publishing a selection of the letters received, which may serve as a reference for young people hesitating at the crossroads of love.]

When a person reaches a certain age, choosing a lifelong partner is an important matter; however, everyone has different ideals.

I believe that an ideal husband should possess the following qualities:

A dignified appearance and neat attire, but without excessive ornamentation; not one who worships current trends, rushing to buy glass suspenders and other such items. This is aesthetic beauty in appearance.

Free from bad habits such as "smoking," "drinking," "prostitution," and "gambling"; striving for the advancement of "intellect," "physicality," "morality," and "beauty." This is inherent beauty.

A strong body, lively spirit, and free from any inheritable or contagious diseases. This is physiological beauty.

Excellent knowledge, having received at least twelve years of education; courageous in service, with a spirit of self-sacrifice for others, and possessing clear judgment and independent thought. This is beauty in knowledge and behavior.

Only an "ideal husband" can marry an "ideal wife," do you agree?

### Not Buying Something

— Xiao Wei

I lament the excessive "self-centeredness" of human nature in this world, which causes all kinds of conflicts and battles. Everyone has their own set of rigid beliefs and wants the world to follow and conform to them. Radical ideologues even resort to bloodshed to force the world to conform instantly, but the result is that humanity suffers before enjoying any benefits. I am deeply concerned about the issue of marriage, but I oppose both parties listing a series of conditions. Choosing a spouse should not be done haphazardly, but it's not entirely like buying something.

### A Letter of Self-Recommendation

— Xu Yeye

Mr. Zhi Wei:

I don't know why, but I finally made up my mind to write this letter. In a mountain city still steeped in feudal colors, this act seems almost absurd, but for that very reason, please do not underestimate it.

Self-introduction:

I am a graduate of a vocational school. I love my work, and I never forget to learn, striving to understand the needs of my time a little more.

I dare only say that in my small circle of life, I can usually handle things calmly.

Would you, Mr. Zhi, care to elaborate on the three words "Truth, Goodness, and Beauty"? How can life be lived to attain the realm of "Truth, Goodness, and Beauty"? Regardless, I want my life to be simple, gentle, and free from gaudiness.

My face is very ordinary! Mr., the women here are all very simple, even more so than your five, six, or seven ideal traits, and I am no exception.

I can probably manage a small family well.

Traveling is my only hobby.

Based on the points above, whether or not there are major discrepancies with your criteria, I hope to become a friend of the opposite sex from another place. I have never been to a bustling metropolis, especially not Shanghai, which is known as a paradise on earth. I would like to get to know it through you. Although I have nothing to offer you, I can report on things that are not found in those glamorous places.

People sacrifice their health, often for one common reason: they cannot manage themselves, leading to unrestrained living and emotional excess.

### Commoner President: Ju Zheng

— George

"Wearing short sleeves and barefoot, holding a hoe, weeding and watering flowers, leisurely and content."

"I was born late and suddenly reached old age, reading books on the ever-changing world, ashamed that I lack the talent to manage the state, fearful of the beans of the same root burning each other, lost in Zhuangzi's butterfly dream, the cuckoo cries in the western region of turmoil, yet glad that autumn is high and I am old and healthy, unknowing and unperceiving, following the great."

The above is a section from the "Sixty Self-Inscription Poem" written by the President of the Judicial Yuan, Ju Zheng, eleven years ago. Currently, the autumn weather is crisp and clear, and our Mr. Ju is as healthy as ever in his old age. The content of the poem is still fitting to the current environment. Next month, on the twentieth, is Mr. Ju's seventieth birthday celebration. It will surely bring many emotions to reread his old work while offering toasts and writing poems.

The President in a Bungalow

I call Mr. Ju a commoner president because, although he is a high-ranking official, his private life is no different from ordinary people. Before the war, he built a residence near Hepingmen in the capital, covering eleven acres of land. However, on such a large area, he only built a few low bungalows, which are as different as clouds and mud compared to the majestic and towering Western-style houses of other dignitaries. At that time, the land and house cost only seven thousand yuan in total. Every time the sun set, inside this house, there was often an old farmer wearing short sleeves and barefoot, wearing a straw hat, holding a hoe, weeding and watering flowers, with a leisurely and content look on his face. It may be hard to believe, but this old farmer was the dignified President Ju.

Mr. Ju not only enjoys the life of a farmer but also calls himself an Australian. On June 14, 1936, he came to Shanghai with his wife and stayed at the New Asia Hotel. The registration used a false name, and the occupation was filled in as "farmer."

Deeply Understands the Art of Living

He dislikes seeing strangers but is happy to write calligraphy. He responds to requests for calligraphy from both acquaintances and strangers alike. He loves to learn horseback riding, and his favorite food is tofu.

Mr. Ju is from Guangji, Hubei, with the given name Juesheng. He studied in Japan in his youth. Speaking of Japan, there is a heartwarming story between Mr. Ju and the country: When Sun Yat-sen was traveling overseas for the revolution, Mr. Ju followed and stayed in Japan. Because Ju's wife, Ms. Zhong, was pregnant, and Mr. Ju was busy with national affairs, he felt burdened by having children. A Japanese friend, Kayanō Nagatomo, was willing to raise one of his daughters. From then on, Miss Ju was raised by a Japanese family, nurtured by Japanese education. Twenty years passed in a blink of an eye. Mr. Ju was occupied with serving the country and had forgotten about this matter until June 1936, when Miss Ju learned about her origins from her foster father Kayanō and returned to China. The reunion of flesh and blood was filled with indescribable joy and sorrow.

Mr. Ju now has one son and three daughters. The eldest daughter is Kayanō Nagako, who was raised in Japan and has married Mr. Zhang Ming. His son, Haoran, graduated from Tsinghua University and the Central Military Academy and is currently serving in the military. He participated in frontline combat during the War of Resistance.

We want a commoner official like President Ju. People's first impression of him is: "Living with the common people." The "officials" we need in the future are this type of official. If we have a particularly good impression of President Ju, the only reason is because "he is a commoner."
