### Peace Talks Become Active Again: Marshal Separately Meets with Yu and Zhou for Talks, and Discusses Opinions with Stuart

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] Marshal Special Envoy, at 9:00 AM on the 9th, met with Ambassador Stuart. The meeting concluded at 9:45 AM. It is reported that the content of the discussion was a comprehensive review of the results of Ambassador Stuart's talks with Zhou Enlai and Chairman Jiang's attitude towards Marshal, as expressed at Guangshan, to serve as a basis for further negotiations with Zhou Enlai. Yu Dawei visited at 10:30 AM and left at 12:30 PM. At 4:00 PM, Zhou Enlai visited Marshal as scheduled. Subsequently, Ambassador Stuart arrived at 7:00 PM and had dinner together. Zhou left at 7:30 PM, while Ambassador Stuart continued the talks until approximately 11:00 PM before departing. It is rumored that the meeting between Ambassador Stuart and Marshal included discussions on the attitude of the United States towards the Anping Incident. Marshal will meet with Zhou Enlai again at 10:00 AM on the 10th for further talks.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] Due to unexpected incidents, the peace talks, which had temporarily subsided, have become active again since Marshal returned to Nanjing. Marshal met with Ambassador Stuart on the morning of the 9th, then received Minister Yu Dawei. In the afternoon, at 4:30 PM, he received Zhou Enlai, representative of the Chinese Communist Party. The content of the talks is unknown.

[United Press, Nanjing, 9th] According to reports: The U.S. State Department has recently sent three telegrams to Marshal, expressing dissatisfaction with the attack on U.S. Marines near Beiping, but this statement has not been officially confirmed. Furthermore, Marshal and Ambassador Stuart hope to understand the attitude of the Communist Party so that peace negotiations can be successful.

### Chen Lifu's Talk with Foreign Reporters: The CCP is Creating Civil War, Delaying to Strengthen Power

[United Press, This City Dispatch] Minister of Organization Chen Lifu met with reporters from United Press today. According to the conversation: The Chinese Communist Party is creating a civil war and placing the responsibility on others. The Communist Party's words and actions do not match, they are accustomed to deception, and their statements have no value. They are currently delaying. The Kuomintang's goal is to resolve the Chinese situation through political means, but the CCP is only delaying negotiations to gain time, strengthen its power, and wait for an opportunity to eliminate the Kuomintang. The CCP does not allow other parties to operate in its controlled areas. Marshal Special Envoy and Ambassador Stuart's "attitude is unusually sincere, and they are working very hard." Marshal and Ambassador Stuart still base their mediation on the CCP's willingness to resolve the issue politically, but will eventually understand that the CCP is merely stalling for time.

Four Proposals from Yan'an

The Yan'an Central Political Bureau passed four proposals on March 20, the content of which fully demonstrates no intention of peaceful negotiations. The government has learned the content of the four proposals as follows: (1) Do everything possible to divide the Kuomintang, causing its reactionary and progressive elements to attack each other, try to approach the progressive elements, and attack the reactionary elements; (2) Purge Kuomintang secret agents and the "CC Clique"; (3) Strive for American sympathy, continue negotiations with the government, but never allow any issue to be resolved. This allows the CCP to gain time to strengthen its military and political power in its controlled areas. Currently, the most important effort should be to occupy the Northeast and isolate Peiping and Tianjin, and then occupy the entire North China; (4) Use all methods to alienate the United States from the government so that the United States no longer provides military and economic assistance to the government.

The above is the CCP's policy, but in the Northeast, the CCP has already failed. I have ten years of experience dealing with the Communist Party and know them better than anyone else in China.

Never Abides by Agreements

Any agreement that the Communist Party acknowledges today, even if it is in black and white, cannot be expected to be followed tomorrow, and their words are practically meaningless. All their actions are to achieve an urgent, immediate goal, so the CCP is a realist. They are selfish, cruel, unreliable, and have no love for the country. The Communist Party focuses its attacks on individuals, calling me a "reactionary element." Anyone who opposes the Communist Party is considered a reactionary element. If you still believe that the Communist Party has any morality, you will inevitably go astray. I have been deceived by the Communist Party many times, and all agreements made with the Communist Party are worthless. They lack sincerity, which is a necessary condition for any agreement. Before the Sino-Japanese War, I represented the government in negotiations with the CCP and offered a final solution opportunity. Unfortunately, the CCP did not fulfill its promise in September 1937, namely "to obey Chiang President's orders, support the Three Principles of the People, abolish the Soviet government within China, and have the CCP army under the command of the supreme commander of the National Army." The CCP has abused its opportunity, and my conclusion is that they do not want to cooperate with the Kuomintang. The Kuomintang does not want to engage in civil war, but the CCP wants to seize power through civil war without taking responsibility for initiating the civil war. Before the ceasefire agreement was signed on January 10 this year, the CCP occupied less than 70 cities; today, they occupy more than 200 cities, which proves that the CCP is violating the ceasefire agreement, and even if it is in black and white, it is still a consistent deceptive tactic.

History Can Prove It

A brief review of modern history may help people better understand the CCP. From 1935 to 1937, because the War of Resistance was inevitable, I exhausted myself in studying the possibility of a Kuomintang-Communist compromise so that the two parties could unite against the common enemy, Japan. China needed to save every drop of blood for the War of Resistance against Japan. If the government had wanted to resort to force, it could have easily eliminated the CCP before the war, but the government decided to preserve the country's strength for a war with Japan. The government, recognizing the serious threat from Japan, urgently wanted to accommodate the CCP and permanently end the historical disputes between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, so it initiated negotiations with the CCP, which lasted for a long time. When the War of Resistance broke out, I immediately asked the CCP to immediately announce its four promises, which the CCP finally announced in September. The government did not easily eliminate the CCP, but was again deceived, because the CCP did not fulfill its promises.

Origin of the Term "CC"

Chen continued to narrate the various facts of the CCP's deception of the Kuomintang in the past 23 years (since 1923). After occupying the area south of the Yangtze River, the Communist Party, fearing that the Kuomintang would complete the Northern Expedition, again went back on its word, collaborated with Wang Jingwei in Hankou, established a "government," and "removed" Chiang Chairman from the position of Commander-in-Chief. To prevent the revolutionary work from being threatened, the Kuomintang immediately established a government in Nanjing, continued the Northern Expedition, and implemented a purge. Seeing the success of the Northern Expedition, Wang Jingwei once again resorted to opportunism, abandoned the Communist Party, and said: During 1929, the new warlords still controlled the area north of the Yangtze River. The Kuomintang then organized secret groups in the areas occupied by the warlords, intending to disband the secret groups after the warlords were eliminated, and their members could openly become Kuomintang members. These secret groups had different names. The reason why I mention this is to explain the origin of the term "CC," which was fabricated by the Communist Party. Chen Guofu had a group called the Central Club, but in reality, there was no such organization as the Central Club. I and Chen Guofu never organized the so-called "CC Clique." Anyone who understands the situation in China knows that Chinese people never use their own names as the names of any organization. The term "CC" quickly disappeared without a trace. It was not until the September 18th Incident that the Japanese brought up this term again, and it began to appear in Japanese newspapers. The Japanese knew that the most ardent group in China to resist Japan was the Kuomintang, so they used the term "CC Clique" to insult it.

Three Conclusions Reached

Finally, Chen said: I have reached three conclusions: (1) The Communist Party regards every person as a tool; (2) The Communist Party regards every action as a means; (3) Every word spoken by the Communist Party is only to adapt to the needs of the time. If the Communist Party can change its basic attitude, there may be some hope for a peaceful solution. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, I have not participated in political struggles against the Communist Party, because I was transferred to the post of Minister of Education in December 1932 until 1944, when I returned to the post of Minister of Organization.

### Shanxi Communist Army Plots to Invade Taiyuan, National Army in Henan Smashes Communist Crossing-the-River Conspiracy

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 9th] The Communist army on the Zhengtai Railway recently converged on Beiheliu between Yuci and Zhuanyang, and harassed and destroyed transportation day and night in sections such as Tangcun and Yanhu Shangmagong Village. Furthermore, in the area south of Taoyang, a large number of Communist troops have recently emerged from counties such as Liaoxian, Xiyang, and Heshun, with the momentum to invade Taiyuan.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] The Communist army in Henan Province has been attacking southward in the area of Meng County since the 5th. By noon on the 6th, they had reached the towns of Yechengzhen and Chenbaicheng, intending to gather their forces, looking like they would cross the Yellow River and invade the south bank of the Yellow River, attempting to cut off the Longhai Railway and threaten Luoyang. However, this attempt was finally repelled and crushed by the National Army on the 9th. The Communist army in that area is currently retreating northward.

### Communist Army Intelligence Personnel in Shandong Infiltrate the Nanjing-Shanghai Line

[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 9th] According to military intelligence, the New Fourth Army previously established a military cadre training class attached to a special agent training class in Linyi, Shandong. Three hundred students graduated on June 30. They were assigned by Commander Chen Yi to various counties along the Nanjing-Shanghai Line to carry out intelligence work. The organization is based on groups, with ten people per group. The salary is two taels and five maces of gold per month per person. These personnel departed from Shandong on July 5 and infiltrated their designated locations to work.

### Qingdao-Jiaozhou Highway Open to Traffic

[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 9th] The railway between Qingdao and Lancun on the Jiaoji Line has been repaired. However, the roadbed between Nanquan and Lancun was destroyed by the Communist army and has not yet been opened to traffic. After the road engineering office actively repaired it, it has been completed. Ticket sales will begin in the next few days. Furthermore, the Qingdao-Jiaozhou Highway officially opened to traffic on the 7th. The Qian Daqing River project before Jiaoxian, namely Heijian, has also been repaired and opened to traffic.

### Bandits Rampage Villages and Towns Near Wujiang and Kunshan

[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 9th] Chenmu Town in Wujiang Kunshan has recently been raided by over a hundred bandits, plundering rural shops, with extreme cruelty. Furthermore, the telephone line between Lili and Pingwang in Wujiang has been cut off by bandits. The town chiefs and Bao chiefs there have all fled. It is said that the bandits from the Yang Fei's unit in Taihu Lake and the Zhou Fei, a self-defense force that defected from Xincheng, have merged, attempting to move towards the above areas. After being detected by the Jiangsu Provincial Security Command, it has ordered the counties of Kunshan and Wujiang to encircle and suppress the bandits within a time limit, and also ordered the Suzhou County government to assist.

### Issue of Reclaiming the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway: Sino-French Negotiations to be Held in Nanjing, Two Countries to Seek Joint Economic and Commercial Development

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] It has been rumored that the French side has agreed to allow us to reclaim the Yunnan section of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway by providing funds, and France has also acknowledged compensation for the losses of public and private materials in Vietnam in 1940, offsetting the price of that section. However, according to information obtained by this reporter from the government, the issue of reclaiming the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway was mentioned in the Sino-French New Treaty signed on February 28 this spring, but the outcome is currently unknown. Furthermore, according to personnel from the French Embassy, since this spring, the two sides have only exchanged some opinions on this issue, and formal negotiations are still pending. It is said that it is not appropriate to speculate too much when a solution to this issue has not been reached. However, according to this reporter's investigation, formal negotiations on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway issue will indeed begin here soon. The French economic advisory group led by Dr. Moore arrived in Nanjing a few days ago. The current task of the group is to quickly conduct extensive research and discussion with the Chinese government on various economic issues between China and France, discuss the losses of official and civilian interests suffered by both sides during the war, and jointly seek the development of Sino-French commercial and economic cooperation.

### Investigation of the Anping Incident: Communist Side Obstructs in Every Possible Way, 25th Group Sat Idle in the Fields Yesterday

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 9th] The Military Mediation Department's 25th Group departed for Anping Town at 2:30 PM on the 9th to investigate the attack on the U.S. military on July 29. They returned to Beiping that evening without results. The group is composed of nine Communist Party members, four government officials, and three American representatives. The government group leader is Zhang Shuheng, the Communist Party group leader is Huang Yifeng, and the American group leader is Davis. After the cars left Dongzhimen, soldiers from the 92nd Army followed to protect them. Communist Party representative Huang Yifeng protested. Government representative Zhang Shuheng immediately indicated that the National Army did not need to follow. Zhang and Huang agreed that in the National Army area, the government representative's car would lead the way, and after entering the "Liberated Area," the Communist Party representative's car would lead the way. When the cars arrived at Anping Town, they did not encounter the Communist army. Major Michael, who witnessed the attack on Anping Town, pointed out the location of the incident and the circumstances of the attack on the spot. Ban Changru, the county magistrate of Xianghe, also arrived at the scene, intending to report the incident to the group. Communist Party representatives insisted on reserving their opinion on these reports, believing that since Anping and surrounding areas were stationed by the National Army, all witnesses and material evidence had been changed and were insufficient as a basis. The three parties argued inconclusively, sitting idle in the fields for a long time. Finally, the Communist Party indicated a concession, believing that the report of the local county magistrate could be heard, but the report of the Communist Party military and political authorities must be heard in the "Liberated Area." Government representatives emphasized that to clarify the truth, the investigation must be thoroughly conducted at the scene of the incident. The American group extended the invitation to Major Michael. The witness had traveled to Tibet. He cited Tibet as an example, saying: In Tibet, disputes are resolved by gathering the public at the scene of the incident for public judgment. Communist Party representatives still disagreed, and the three parties returned to Beiping.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 9th] The Military Mediation Department's 25th Group, which departed for Anping Town yesterday to inspect the scene, was again stranded on the beach of "investigation procedures" today. From 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM, the group held a meeting. The American side extended the invitation to a representative from the U.S. Marine Corps headquarters to report on the Anping incident. The Communist Party first proposed verifying the identity of the representative from the Marine Corps headquarters. After verification, the Communist Party still opposed listening to the representative's report, believing that the "investigation procedure" must be established first before proceeding to listen to the report. The meeting ended at noon without results. At 2:30 PM, the meeting resumed for discussion. One American reporter and two government reporters (one from the Central News Agency and one from this newspaper) were present. Communist Party representative Huang Yifeng opposed the participation of reporters for the following reasons: (1) Reporters' participation should be limited to the discussion of investigation materials; (2) The Communist Party reporter has not yet arrived. Huang continued to oppose listening to the Marine Corps headquarters representative's report before the "investigation procedure" was established. The American and Communist sides debated fiercely until 3:00 PM. American representative Davis proposed an adjournment to consult with Commissioner Robertson, and Huang also consulted with Ye Jianying. The meeting was announced to resume at 4:46 PM. At that time, a Communist Party reporter had arrived from Zhangjiakou. The Communist Party indicated a concession, agreeing to reporters attending the meeting, but insisted on the "investigation procedure" drafted by the Communist Party. The procedure was (1) Listen to the report of the Marine Corps headquarters; (2) Listen to the report of the Communist Party local military and political authorities; (3) Listen to the report of the government local military authorities; (4) Determine the witnesses from all three sides and listen to the witnesses' reports; (5) Other necessary measures; (6) Summarize the investigation report and have the three commissioners publish the news. Davis largely agreed to the procedure he drafted, but believed that the U.S. Marine Corps headquarters report should be heard immediately and work should not be delayed by planning procedures. In the end, no agreement was reached, and the meeting ended on an unhappy note. It was decided to discuss it again at 9:00 AM on the 10th. During the meeting on the 9th, Davis held his drooping head in his hands, seemingly overwhelmed by the brain drain. Furthermore, the three committees decided to send a liaison group from the Communist Party to contact the Communist Party's Jidong Military Region to prepare for the investigation, but they had not yet departed as of the afternoon of the 9th.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 9th] The Military Mediation Department's 25th Group, which was investigating the case of the attack on the U.S. military in Xianghe, has been unable to conduct the investigation because the Communist Party has been obstructing it in every possible way under the pretext of procedural issues, and the truth cannot be revealed. An observer told reporters that the purpose of the Communist Party's actions is nothing more than two points: one is to attempt to end the matter without resolving it and delay it to reduce public attention; the other is to delay and harass the American side, forcing the American side to propose a solution directly when it is unable to do so, and then use it as a propaganda argument to accuse the U.S. military's actions in China of being too subjective and making claims about events without clarifying the truth.

### Taking over Enemy Property, Memorization of Relief Methods

Executive Yuan Issues Order to Be Followed Nationwide

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 9th] (1) The Executive Yuan recently issued the "Regulations on Taking over Japanese Property in China, Compensating for Our Country's Losses, and Memorizing Relief Methods," ordering all receiving agencies across the country to memorize and report relief efforts. The regulations stipulate four items to be regarded as non-compensatory property: (A) Aircraft, cannons, and other weapons of the army, navy, and air force; (B) Banknotes of the puppet reserve bank and the industries operated by the organization; (C) Property occupied by the people; (D) Land and mining rights occupied by China, etc. The following three items should be regarded as compensatory property: (A) Industries operated with Japanese funds; (B) Mechanical equipment transported to China by Japan; (C) All Japanese-owned industries and houses, etc. It is also stipulated that the depreciation and consumption of received compensatory property should be recorded separately and reported.

### Inspection Team in North China Sighs at Difficulty of Work

Tianjin and Beijing Industry Is in Imminent Danger

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 9th] A person in charge today sighed and said that dealing with the takeover is really difficult. After the inspection team arrived, it ordered the takeover agencies to send the original manifest if it had not been sent, but some ignored it, and some replied that it had been submitted to the competent department. Therefore, it is not dare to be certain whether the inspection team can do anything. Jinyanshenxing also pointed out that due to the instability of the overall situation, the central government has ignored the importance of North China's economy, and under the policy of military first and finance first, economic policy is not valued. As a result, many important factories in Tianjin and Beijing are still unable to produce effectively today, and state-owned key industries are mostly paralyzed, with operators unable to do anything. Due to the influx of foreign goods, private industries are unable to maintain themselves. In fact, if the government can enable these endangered industries to compete with foreign goods for one year, they can safely survive. The government's emphasis on Shanghai and ignoring North China is in danger. In addition, it is known that the second auction of factories being taken over in Tianjin and Beijing is being held. There are more buyers than the first time, because this time it also comes with a loan of a considerable amount of working capital to help them operate.

### A Record of Aerial Inspection Over the Flood in Northern Jiangsu

— By Zhang Ming, Our Correspondent in Nanjing

Can you believe that the water that God gives us to live on has now become a weapon of tyranny! The large-scale breaches in Northern Jiangsu are the result of the Communist army's venting its anger after losing its military offensive in Northern Jiangsu. The flood came like an avalanche, and the lives and property of millions of innocent compatriots were swallowed up here.

Can you imagine countless people living on rooftops that are barely above water, eating wind and sleeping in dew? This is the "benevolent governance" bestowed by the Communist army! But the Communist army says, "This is caused by the rising floodwaters." However, why does the "democratic government," which is "all for the people," turn a blind eye? In any case, it cannot be denied that the Communist army of the "democratic government" "masters" the lives and property of the "people."

Facts speak louder than words. Today, this fact is finally unfolding before the eyes of our group of Chinese and foreign journalists.

The motive is as follows: At the foreign press conference of the Central Propaganda Department on the 6th, someone proposed to go to Northern Jiangsu for an on-the-spot inspection. With the permission of the Central Propaganda Department, a special plane was dispatched to transport us to the inspection. Thus, on the morning of the 9th, fifteen Chinese and foreign journalists gathered at the Lishi Society and set off for the airport. The units they represented were: United Press, Associated Press, International News Service, The New York Times, New York Herald Tribune, Reuters, Indian Free Press, Agence France-Presse, and domestic newspapers Shanghai Shen Bao, Ta Kung Pao, Southeast Daily, Central News Agency, Nanjing Central Daily, Dagan Bao, and Xinmin Evening News. In addition, personnel from the International Publicity Department and the Ministry of National Defense were sent along on the same plane to serve as translators and explainers. Zhong Da, a liaison officer from the 12th Squadron of the Air Force, was also sent to provide terrain information. In total, there were twenty people. At 10:00 AM, we boarded plane (C-51 1296) and departed, driven by Deng Congshou and Zhang Bainian, with Zhou Ronghui and Xiong Ke as communicators. The trip was expected to be 420 English miles, departing from Nanjing, passing through Suqian, Yaowan, and Zhaodun, the Yunhe station near Xuzhou, then flying along the railway line through Xinan Town, directly to Donghai and Guanyun, and returning to Nanjing via Zhundui. There were four flooded areas along the way: (1) Zhaodun, (2) Xinan Town, (3) Shangfang Street, (4) Qiaoche Town.

The pilot maintained an altitude of 3,000 feet at all times to avoid accidents. We boarded the plane at 10:00 AM, and it took ten minutes to ascend. The temperature changed from hot to cool. White clouds floated past the wings of the plane. After passing through Zhubao Town, we reached Jintai and entered the Communist-controlled area. From here, we could only see water below. Because the water level of Hongze Lake was very high, the low-lying areas along the lake and the farmland were flooded with a lot of water. It was 10:37 AM and we were over the lake. After passing Hongze Lake, we found many deep black lines on the ground, matching the vast green plain. It is said that the black ones are dikes and the green ones are still water. These are the small rivers specially controlled by the Communist army to divert water into the villages. At this time, we removed the cabin door on the plane, and the investigators looked down, and a small number of people looked with binoculars. At 10:50 AM, we arrived at Yangbeiji. From here, the scenes of the breaches were clearly visible. The water was shining, and only the green roots of the trees were dotted among them, like stars in the dark sky. After passing this flooded area, irregular water flows could still be found scattered in the fields. At 11:10 AM, we flew over Suqian. The water was increasing sharply. The fuselage lowered and circled the area once. There were eight breaches, and the flooded area was 18 square miles, which was also the smallest area, namely Yaowan. At 11:20 AM, we passed Yaowan, and the plane pointed to Zhaodun. According to the explanation of the liaison officer of the Ministry of National Defense, this breach was 1,400 feet long, and the flooded area was 156 square kilometers. The bridge markers had been destroyed and washed away. Looking down, we only saw the water waves and the sun reflecting, sparkling in thousands of points. Naturally, this was not still water. The water was still surging rapidly. It is said that ten days ago, there was no water in this flooded area, and a week ago, there was only a small amount of water, but today the water has reached a vast area.

From 11:35 AM, we turned east and began to fly along the Longhai Railway. The Longhai Railway seemed to be still. The vehicles did not move because the bridges were destroyed and the roadbed was cut into sections. The person who explained pointed to us and said that it was almost cut into thousands of sections.

The pilot maintained an altitude of 3,000 feet at all times to avoid accidents that no one dared to guarantee.

Continuing east, we arrived over Donghai at 11:50 AM. There were 37 breaches here, and the flooded area was 202 square kilometers. The plane passed around it. We all wanted to find a little land in the water, but water, water, water, you close your eyes and it is still water. Everywhere there were breaches like broken strings, and the flood was flowing rapidly. We couldn't find the shadows of villages or houses, and we didn't see a person or a boat. We couldn't imagine where they had gone. On the "oases" that we occasionally saw, we could see golden things being dried on the ground. It turned out that this was their food - the tops of corn trees. The rooftops became the star-scattered pieces in the chessboard, occasionally appearing in the middle of the water. Looking down from the plane, it was already unchanging, all big water. It was 12:35 PM, so we turned south again to the Guanyun flooded area. There were 122 breaches here, and the flooded area was 100 square kilometers. How many lives were swallowed up by it!

After circling the flooded area, the direction pointed southwest, and the journey back began. Slowly, we saw the lovely land, tens of thousands of acres of fields, and our mood was relaxed. At this time, we passed Huaiyin, the hub of the Communist army in Northern Jiangsu, but we were blocked by the clouds and didn't see anything. It was 12:50 PM.

Our journey back to Nanjing began at 1:00 PM. The foreign journalists first fell asleep in the belly of the plane, and the fuselage also shook uneasily. We returned to Minggugong Airport hungry, and the time was exactly 1:50 PM, bringing back thousands of "tragic" words. Is this the work of mankind? We cannot believe it!

### Director Jiang Talks About Relief Work, UNRRA Should Continue Its Work, Eggerton to Depart for China Within Days From Geneva

[Our Newspaper] After La Guardia advocated at the UNRRA Congress that UNRRA activities should be concluded around October 10 and that he should be relieved of his own duties, Director Jiang Tingfu of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA) officially expressed his opposition yesterday. Jiang stated that the relief and rehabilitation work in the Far East and Europe has not yet been completed. If UNRRA is terminated, another international organization must be established to handle this issue, and setting up another organization will take considerable time. UNRRA's work is unfinished, and its mid-term termination will inevitably cause many difficulties. Jiang advocated that all countries should allow UNRRA to continue its work and terminate it only after one year in order to complete the minimum goals that UNRRA wanted to achieve when it was established.

[Reuters, Geneva, 8th] Chinese representative Li Zhuomin stated at the UNRRA meeting today that some UNRRA China Office staff do not understand China's difficulties. Most of them only stay in Shanghai and are inevitably separated from the actual situation in China. Li then suggested that the United Nations agency should make humanitarian work a part of its entire mission, and also advocated that member states donate funds to relieve disasters that occur at any time. Regarding UNRRA's work in China, Li said that the person in charge of the UNRRA China Office changes from time to time, making it difficult for policies to be consistent, so much time is spent on adjustments. Many war supplies purchased by UNRRA in the Pacific region do not have instructions when they arrive in China, so they must be opened box by box before they can know what is in the box and then determine the allocation policy. Some machines are not suitable for use in China, and other machines or important items have missing parts or need major repairs. The Chinese government is willing to do its best to cooperate with UNRRA to make UNRRA's plan a success. Before Li's speech, representatives from five countries, including the Czech Republic, Poland, Yugoslavia, Austria, and Greece, requested that UNRRA extend its relief work in Europe to 1947.

[United Press, Washington, 8th] UNRRA's new director of the China Office, Eggerton, said today that he will depart for China within days to seek solutions to the allocation issues between UNRRA and CRRRA. At the same time, UNRRA Acting Director Logus said that UNRRA relief supplies are flooding Shanghai, and from all aspects, the fault does not lie with China. We are forced by transportation conditions to ship many items to Shanghai, and the Chinese side has not received a notice, but we hope that we can soon have unlimited shipping. In addition, Wang Jun, Chairman of the Chinese Supply Committee in the United States, said that the National Government is awaiting Eggerton's arrival, and we will do our best to provide assistance and cooperation.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 8th] Military, political, and diplomatic leaders in this area hosted a banquet on the afternoon of the 8th to bid farewell to Eggerton. Ambassador Gu Weijun also participated, as did Acting Director-General Rooks and others.

### Taiwan Sugar Corporation Releases Current Status of World Sugar Production

China Can Be Self-Sufficient in Five Years

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 9th] Taiwan Sugar Corporation recently released the current status of sugar production in various countries around the world, stating that according to the average statistics from 1935 to 1939, the world's annual sugar production before the war was a total of 34.5 million tons, but according to the famous Lamorghillon Sugar Market Report of the world sugar industry, the report in June of this year stated that last year (i.e., the 1945-1946 period), the world's sugar production had shrunk to 27.2 million tons, with Cuba accounting for the first place, Java second, India third, and Taiwan fourth. The company's conclusion is: "Cuban, Javanese, and Indian sugar are currently unable to invade the Chinese market." The company also stated: "China's annual sugar demand is about 800,000 to 1 million tons. According to Taiwan Sugar Corporation's five-year production increase plan, by the winter of the 37th year, that is, the 1947-1948 period, it will only be able to produce 500,000 tons of sugar. If it wants to increase production to 800,000 tons, it must work hard for five years. If it wants to obtain the Japanese market, it must wait for the implementation of the second five-year plan.

### Catholic Priests and Others in Shandong Detained and Abused by the Communist Army, The Vatican Has Received a Report and Will Appeal to General Marshall

[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 8th] A certain Catholic priest recently fled here from the CCP border area of ​​Hebei, Shandong, Henan, and Anhui. According to his statement, more than 100 Catholic priests in the dioceses of Yanzhou and Caozhou in Shandong Province, including priests of Canadian, Belgian, Polish, Yugoslav, and Hungarian nationalities, are currently in a dangerous situation. The Caozhou CCP authorities arrested the 68-year-old Archbishop Huwaz (probably of Dutch nationality) on July 15 this year. Ten German priests and nuns were also arrested at the same time. The hospital established by the church, with the best equipment in the entire city, has been closed, and the patients in the hospital have also been expelled. According to the local CCP authorities, the arrests were caused by reports from residents. From July 15 to 22, there were frequent mass gatherings in the city, sometimes with as many as 3,000 people each time. The city authorities told them, "You are backward elements, you want to drink foreigners' water." After these people refused to accuse the Catholic Church, the authorities educated them. Representatives from the business community and the private sector repeatedly appealed for the release of the detainees, but were not granted. The detainees were tried once on July 25, but remained in prison until the 28th and were not sentenced. The detainees were paraded through the streets twice a day on July 22 and 23, directly to the church. A wooden sign was placed outside the church with the words "This is where the criminals are located." The holy relics of the church were exposed. Archbishop Huwaz fainted several times due to his old age and frailty. The public witnessed his pitiful situation, but could not help him. The situation of the Catholic Church in the area has been reported to Archbishop Cai Ning, the representative of the Holy See. The Vatican authorities have also received the report, and the US Embassy in the capital has also taken note of this. This matter will probably be reported to Special Envoy Marshall, requesting him to forward the question to the CCP. However, according to people around General Marshall, they have not received this report.

At the same time, CCP spokesman Wang Bingnan declared today: "Our purpose is not to attack the church. We know nothing about this unexpected incident." When reporters asked whether the CCP discriminated against German Catholics, the spokesman replied: "No, unless these people's behavior endangers the 'liberated area,' then we will treat them differently."

Editorial

### A Review of Post-War Relief Work

According to a United Press report from Geneva on the 7th: LaGuardia, Director-General of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), will come to China in October to inspect the situation. UNRRA's Eastern operations will end on March 31st of next year. However, according to CNRRA Director-General Jiang, the date UNRRA ends is at the end of this year. CNRRA was originally scheduled to end at the end of March next year, but because China is vast and transportation is difficult, China hopes to extend the CNRRA's working time to September 30th of next year, because in China, "time" is "material."

We sympathize with Director-General Jiang's view that "time is material," and naturally, we are even more in favor of extending the time limit for CNRRA's work. However, we cannot but deeply review how the past post-war relief work has been. Otherwise, even if the time is extended, if the work is still inefficient, wouldn't it be even more shameful? How the "CNRRA" has been working since its establishment a year ago has long been a concern of the Chinese people. We are willing to take advantage of the upcoming visit of the Director-General of UNRRA to China for inspection and the special meeting of UNRRA's Far East representatives held in Shanghai today to conduct a brief review.

First of all, what we want to raise is that "UNRRA" should quickly issue a removal of the ban on the shipment of materials to China. The issuance of the ban on the shipment of materials to China seems to have not been carefully considered in advance, which is really a regrettable thing. Now that the Director-General of UNRRA has explained that the matter is entirely due to the congestion of Chinese port ships in June, and it is expected that the situation will greatly improve in September, then it is already mid-August, why is the ban, which is not very reasonable, still not lifted? As for a part of the staff of a local office openly publishing a letter criticizing the post-war relief agency in their resident country, it not only shows that the "UNRRA" staff is undisciplined, but also shows that the "UNRRA" itself has organizational flaws. We cannot solely blame CNRRA.

Speaking of "CNRRA," we should have a recognition that its work is arduous and subject to various objective constraints. Its work certainly cannot be satisfactory in all aspects. The lack of transportation, the unrest in the localities, and the failure of cooperation between government departments to meet ideal expectations, all make its work unable to achieve its ideal. The vast scope of "CNRRA's" activities, coupled with the aforementioned difficulties, further hinders "CNRRA's" work. According to Director-General Jiang Tingfu, the amount of materials now handled by "CNRRA" is equivalent to three times the total amount of goods imported by our country before the war, and its value is equivalent to twice the total national budget of our country before the war. Because its scope of activities is so vast and it is still in its infancy, it is natural to forgive the fact that "CNRRA's" activities have not been as satisfactory as expected. But what we do not understand is: (1) In terms of selling relief materials, what is the policy adopted by "CNRRA"? (2) Since "CNRRA" is a department of the Executive Yuan, why can the system of "CNRRA" be outside the general government system?

Regarding the first point, that is, in terms of selling relief materials, we know that the amount of materials under the control of "CNRRA" is extremely large. Part of the relief materials was originally agreed by "UNRRA" to be sold, that is, to use the proceeds to operate post-war relief business - it is said that the proceeds are used to maintain the expenses of the organization. But is the purpose of selling these relief materials entirely for revenue, or does it have a role in stabilizing domestic prices in addition to revenue? If it is the former, then post-war relief is only a nominal name. In fact, isn't it close to a large-scale trust that specializes in import trade with preferential conditions? As a result, it only makes the almost collapsing national economy worse, which seems to be contrary to the original intention of post-war relief. Now the cotton in the hands of "CNRRA" can supply yarn factories across the country. We do not understand why "CNRRA" has supplied this cotton to public and private yarn factories, but it has not been able to achieve the practical effect of suppressing yarn prices? According to Director-General Jiang, the power to suppress yarn prices is not in the hands of "CNRRA." This may be partly true, but what we do not understand is why "CNRRA" has so much huge amount of materials but cannot make efforts to stabilize prices, but still sits and watches the rise in yarn prices? Everything seems to point to a fact, that is, "CNRRA" only increases revenue, not only has it not made efforts to suppress prices, but also its dumping of materials inevitably helps to increase prices. In terms of handling the sale of relief materials, we want to ask where is the policy of "CNRRA"?

According to Director-General Jiang's previous statement at the Legislative Yuan's inquiry session: "CNRRA" has a 50% welfare fund for its staff in addition to the general civil servant treatment in order to prevent corruption, which is not available to general civil servants. What we do not understand is: If "CNRRA" is a part of the government, then its staff should be no different from general civil servants. The stipulation of this special treatment is obviously intended to undermine the general civil servant system and form a separate system outside the general civil servant system, which is tantamount to undermining the unity of national administration and the unity of the system. If it is to prevent corruption, we want to ask whether "CNRRA" can achieve a clean and upright administration with the addition of a 50% welfare fund? Furthermore, "CNRRA" certainly wants to prevent corruption, but doesn't any other agency need to prevent corruption? May I ask if any other agency has a 50% welfare fund? Some people outside deliberately say that the Relief Administration should be called "Relief Self-Administration." We hope that CNRRA will use facts to wash away this insult.

We understand the arduousness of "CNRRA's" work, but we cannot allow the unity of the national administrative system to be undermined because of the arduousness of the work, and we cannot allow the lack of policy in handling the sale of relief materials, which instead promotes the wealth of a few and the suffering of the majority. We hope that the government can pay attention to the implementation of this important policy, which is closely related to the prosperity and decline of the people's livelihood and economy and the revival of the nation, so that it can make necessary improvements.

### Former Anhui Province Puppet Governor Ni Daolang Sentenced to Death

[Our Newspaper's Bengbu Correspondence] Ni Daolang, the former Anhui puppet governor and huge traitor, has been interrogated several times by the High Branch Court here. The debate has ended, and the sentence was pronounced at 4:00 p.m. on the 5th. At about 3:00 p.m., Ni was brought from the detention center to the trial room by bailiffs.

At this point, he ordered him to be returned to custody and then adjourned the court.

### Soviet Union's Proposed Resolutions are Vetoed; Procedural Issues Spark Debate Again; Bidault is Retained as Chairman After Persuasion

[Our Newspaper's Report] Paris, Broadcast on the 9th: The Peace Conference continued at approximately 4 PM today (midnight in Shanghai). Chairman Bidault proposed that the conference adopt the regulations committee's resolution to permit journalists to attend meetings of the various committees, which was approved. Bidault then stated that he has chaired the conference eight times and that according to regulations, he should relinquish the chairmanship to another previously selected chairman. Bernas expressed his respect for the representatives of the host country and argued that Bidault should continue as chairman for the next three days, as Bidault's responsibilities as chairman only truly began this afternoon. Australian representative Evatt supported Bernas's opinion. Bidault replied that he did not wish to shirk his responsibilities, but rather to strictly adhere to the regulations. It was then decided that he would continue as chairman for another three days. Soviet representative Vyshinsky rose to speak, questioning who was responsible for arranging the conference agenda, stating that he did not have a Russian version of the agenda and that it was the result of a lack of organization and excessive haste. He believed that the agenda should be determined in advance and announced to the various delegations to allow for preparation.

[Our Newspaper's Report] Paris, Broadcast on the 9th: At the meeting this afternoon, the Peace Conference again witnessed lengthy debate over the agenda. Vyshinsky argued for dividing the agenda into "various dispositions" and general matters, assigning the relevant agenda items to the secretariat and the conference. The Yugoslav representative proposed that to avoid lengthy and endless discussions, the agenda should be determined by the consent of the current chairman and the other chairmen. Spaak and Alexander both rose to speak in succession. Finally, Bidault stated that the agenda was drafted by the Secretary-General and that the matters to be discussed in the afternoon were usually a continuation of the unresolved issues from the morning meeting. Bidault's voice rose in pitch during his final remarks.

[Our Newspaper's Report] Paris, Broadcast on the 9th: At today's plenary session of the Peace Conference, Molotov once again proposed an amendment requesting the restoration of the two-thirds majority voting system. US Secretary of State Byrnes engaged in heated debate with representatives from Ukraine and Belarus. As a result, the conference rejected the amendment by a vote of 15 to 6 and accepted the British amendment, which divided the voting methods into two categories: the first being those passed by a two-thirds majority, which the four major foreign ministers must give full consideration; the second being those passed by a simple majority, which the four major foreign ministers should also consider, but with less weight than the first category. The Soviet Union and its supporting nations did not concede defeat and made new attempts to amend the procedures, but were ultimately rejected. The conference accepted the rules drafted by the Regulations Committee by a vote of 15 to 4, with two abstentions.

[United Press, Paris, 9th] At this morning's plenary session of the Peace Conference, the Soviet Union's proposal to restore the strict two-thirds majority voting rule was defeated by a vote of 15 to 6. The countries supporting the Soviet Union were Belarus, Ukraine, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Yugoslavia.

The note also stated that it accepted the United States' proposal to merge the US-occupied zone with other occupied zones. France has not yet agreed to this.

### The United Kingdom Has the Right to Act Alone to Protect Oil Fields in Iraqi Territory; Foreign Office Spokesman Responds to Iranian Protest

[Our Newspaper's Report] London, Broadcast on the 9th: A British Foreign Office spokesman stated: If a sudden event occurs in Iran that threatens the lives and property of British citizens, the United Kingdom will not be bound by consultations with the UN Security Council and will believe that it has reason to take "unilateral action." According to the Iranian government's statement yesterday, the Iranian government has protested the entry of Indian troops into Basra, Iraq, and demanded the withdrawal of the Indian troops. According to previous explanations by the British government, the deployment of Indian troops was to replace troops stationed near the British-Iranian oil fields in southern Iran.

### The British Government Indicates It Will Not Relinquish Control of Palestine; Takes Measures to Prevent Illegal Jewish Immigration; Sets Up Jewish Refugee Camps on Cyprus

[Central News Agency, London, 8th, United Press] The British Labour Party government's newspaper "Daily Herald" stated that the British government is preparing to submit the Palestine federal plan to the next UN General Assembly in New York for global discussion. The British cabinet has insisted that it will not relinquish the mandated territory of Palestine under any circumstances, and that even if the United States refuses to assist, the United Kingdom will do its best to complete the federal plan.

[Reuters, London, 9th] Reliable sources anticipate that the government will issue new plans by the end of the week regarding the control of illegal immigration to Palestine. Informed sources here believe that this plan is intended to prevent Jewish refugees from traveling from Italian seaports to Palestine and instead direct them to Cyprus, where British control is most readily achieved. However, a large number of Jewish refugees have already left Eastern Europe, mostly via the Romanian Black Sea, which is beyond the control of British forces. Therefore, this measure can only address a portion of the problem.

[Reuters, Nicosia, Cyprus, 8th] A battalion of British infantry arrived here today and will be stationed in Beharia. Furthermore, according to related sources, the first group of 500 Jewish refugees attempting to enter Palestine without legal documents will be relocated here tomorrow, and the second group of 2,000 will arrive next week.

[Reuters, Jerusalem, 8th] It is reported that the Jewish Agency has completed preparations for the reception of 100,000 Jewish immigrants. The Agency has purchased a military camp capable of accommodating 10,000 people from the US military stationed in France, which will be dismantled and transported to Palestine for installation. Since January of this year, the number of Jews who have arrived in Palestine without legal documents has reached 10,000, all of whom have found employment.

Arabs Refuse to Participate in Round Table Conference

Sulayman's statement was made after the Chairman of the Supreme Arab Committee of Palestine, Husseini, rejected the British invitation to attend the London Round Table Conference.

It is claimed that Yoshida said that Japan and all countries of the world are eager to end the post-war state as soon as possible, so that political, economic, industrial, and commercial activities can return to normal.

### Far East International Tribunal: Ugaki's Memorial and Arita's Report Relate the Course of Seeking Peace with China. Tojo Once Issued Orders to Abuse Prisoners of War. Hashimoto's Writings from Years Ago Now Serve as Powerful Evidence.

[Kaizo-sha Tokyo, 9th] Today, the International Tribunal first presented Ugaki Kazushige's memorial submitted on September 21, 1938, and Arita Hachiro's report presented to the Privy Council meeting on November 29, 1938. Ugaki's memorial stated: "Between July and September 14, 1938, I discussed resolving Anglo-Japanese issues with the British Ambassador to Japan, strongly urging the British Ambassador to compromise with Japan and abandon the policy of aiding China. However, the British Ambassador insisted on quickly resolving Anglo-Japanese issues related to British interests in China, leading to a failure to reach an understanding between the two parties." Arita's report strongly asserted that Japan would not make peace with the Chinese government, stating that the Chinese government must abandon its policy of tolerating communism and resisting Japan, dissolve itself, and merge with the puppet regime before it could

consider peace, reaffirming the strengthening of the anti-communist axis of Japan, Germany, and Italy, and taking various measures against the Soviet Union to prevent its active participation in the incident. Next, a statement made by the defendant Sato Kenryo at a meeting of temporary police chiefs on August 25, 1938, was presented. At the time, Sato was the head of the press section of the Army Ministry and stated that the current incident had complex changes, so the war objectives were also unclear, and the war had deviated from its initial plan. Negotiations regarding the peace issue began in August 1937 through the German Ambassador, and in December, the Japanese side proposed conditions such as cooperation with Japan's "Manchukuo" anti-communist policy, the establishment of demilitarized zones, the conclusion of Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo economic agreements, and reparations, but the Chinese side did not respond. Therefore, the Japanese side held an imperial conference on January 11, 1938, and decided to adopt a

long-term war posture and declared that it would not treat the National Government as its opponent. As for foreign relations, the current conflict with the Soviet Union is actually disadvantageous, and if war is unavoidable, it should be after 1942. As for Britain, it recognizes some of its interests. Next, the minutes of the Privy Council meeting on December 2, 1938, were presented, outlining the process of Japan's opposition to the League of Nations. Next, a situation assessment report submitted by the Central China Expeditionary Army Headquarters to the Army Vice Minister Yamawaki on July 20, 1939, was presented, outlining various strategies for coping with a long-term war, and establishing a "New Central Government" with Wang Jingwei as its leader, actively promoting its development, strengthening its self-defense capabilities, and economically preventing third countries from assisting the central government, hindering the production and circulation of important military supplies and daily necessities in the mainland, and simultaneously continuing

to blockade the Yangtze River, striving to expel British influence in the Yangtze River basin, and actively working on the concessions, especially the Shanghai concession, anticipating that military force would be used for this purpose.

[United Press, Yokohama, 9th] Secondary Japanese war criminals are being tried here today. Also, Tojo, while serving as Minister of the Army, issued a notice to all concentration camps stating: "Do not misunderstand humanitarianism or be swayed by personal feelings towards prisoners of war. All prisoners of war must be strictly disciplined, and prisoners of war must be given the treatment they deserve, so that the Japanese people can recognize the excellent character of the Japanese nation and the special rights and honors enjoyed by the Japanese people.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 8th Dispatch] Excerpts from Hashimoto Kingoro's book "The Inevitability of Innovation" revealed his extreme joy when he drowned Chinese soldiers in the Yangtze River and his advocacy of expelling British and American influence from China to realize the expansionist plans of Japan. This summary has been submitted to the court as evidence against Hashimoto.

### Plan to Invade Outer Mongolia

[United Press Tokyo, 9th] During the trial of Japanese war criminals today, evidence revealed that Tojo Hideki, the former Prime Minister who served as Vice Minister of the Army in the Konoe Cabinet in 1938, received a "top secret" order and plan. The Kwantung Army conducted military operations in Northeast China, invading the Outer Mongolian region under the sphere of influence of the Soviet Far East. The purpose of the plan was to conduct strategic actions against Outer Mongolia and to conduct actual surveys of the strategic geography of important areas along the Mongolian border, while studying the general materials already obtained, as well as natural resources. The Kwantung Army sent the plan to Tojo in Tokyo. Its origin was clearly due to the Kwantung Army's eagerness to advance north again, on the one hand to make the anti-communist zone in Outer Mongolia more stable, and on the other hand to collect geographical and strategic materials for future war against the Soviet Union.

### Compensation Conference Convened, No Response from the Soviet Union Yet

[United Press Washington, 8th] According to some people in the Far Eastern Commission, the Soviet Union will try to prevent the U.S. plan to convene a compensation conference as soon as possible to dispose of Japanese assets. The Soviet Union intends to regulate the liquidation of industrial equipment moved from Northeast China last year. The Soviet Union has not responded to the U.S. suggestion that it would be best to convene the compensation conference in mid-August. It is expected that when the Far Eastern Commission holds a meeting on August 15, it will consider the responses of various governments, but the Soviet Union will not submit a response. These people believe that even if the Soviet Union submits a response, it will be necessary to demand that the scope of discussion at the compensation conference be limited to domestic assets in Japan and not involve foreign assets such as those in Northeast China. The Soviet Union can arbitrarily prevent any action from being taken by exercising the veto power stipulated in the Moscow Convention.

### In the Midst of Disputes on the Siam-Vietnam Border, Reports of an Attack on a City in Vietnam - The Nationality of the Attacking Forces is Unknown

[Reuters Paris, 8th] Semi-official French reports state that about 550 people in khaki uniforms, of unknown nationality, crossed the border yesterday and attacked the city of Siem Reap in eastern Cambodia. It is claimed that the attack order was issued by a French military officer. It is noted that the city was besieged by Thailand in 1941, and later, under Japanese pressure, the Zaxi regime ceded the nearby provinces of Sisophon and Batdambang to Thailand. There have been frequent border incidents in the Viet-Thai region in the past few months.

### Our Second Honor Division Will Soon Be Transferred from Vietnam to Japan

### Indian National Congress Executive Committee Meeting

Held in Wardha

London Pays Close Attention

[Reuters London, 8th] Political figures in London are paying close attention to the meeting of the Executive Committee of the Indian National Congress held in Wardha, India, because whether the political deadlock in India can be broken depends on the decisions of the meeting.

[Reuters New Delhi, 8th] The Executive Committee of the Indian National Congress met in Wardha, Central Province, today, chaired by Nehru, for four hours, discussing the general political situation after the Muslim League rejected the Federal India plan proposed by the British Cabinet Mission. Nehru said in his speech that what we are discussing now is a very serious matter, and it will take at least three or four days to reach any resolution.

### American Journalism Schools - The Pastoral Scenery of Missouri, the Hometown of President Truman

— Our newspaper's special correspondent in the United States, Mao Shuqing

(Continued from yesterday) Editorial professor Bai Langte, had lived in Tokyo for three years, his conversational skills were very good, and he remembered the names of Chinese students very well. He often helped students revise editorials, although his right hand was already suffering from rheumatism, he was still very energetic working beside the typewriter. Mr. Sharpe almost devoted his life to the journalism school, he was the editor-in-chief of the newspaper, he led students out to practice interviewing, came back to sort out the news, and revised headlines for the students, he was the most prestigious figure in the small town of Columbia, the residents not only knew him, but also respected him.

Columbia is too small, with a total of only 18,000 residents, two main streets, and a few small streets, that's all. The students probably feel the most pain in the interviewing class. They have to interview for news every day, and without news, they can't submit their assignments, so the birth of a son in one family and the death of a daughter in another family become their interview targets. Our group of four people arrived in Columbia from St. Louis and immediately became news targets, and the next day it was published in the "Missouri Newspaper." The newspaper school's library has a lot of books, including China's Central Daily News, Ta Kung Pao, Shen Bao, and Xinwen Bao. They have a complete set of the New York Times, and have compiled a very detailed "Index." There are many American female students in the Missouri Journalism School, most of them study advertising because studying advertising can earn more money. There are currently Xie Ranzhi, Zhang Xuesui, Wu Xiyuan, Zeng Meixia and Chen Mou and others among the Chinese students. In a recent scholarship thesis competition, Xie Ranzhi (formerly the president of Xinhu Bei Daily News in China) won second place in the entire school. Unfortunately, I didn't have time to visit

Missouri Agricultural College, there are several Chinese students studying agriculture in Missouri, and two studying economics. The day after we arrived, all the Chinese students invited us to lunch at a restaurant. In this quiet and remote city, a gathering of more than a dozen people seems to be a big deal. The car left Columbia the following afternoon. At the time of parting, I saw the six stone pillars of the University of Missouri, and had unspeakable reluctance. The six stone pillars stand in front of the general office of the University of Missouri. It is said that they are the remains of a major fire a long time ago. Now, the university authorities have specially published a booklet to "archaeologize" the six stone pillars. I didn't visit the two women's colleges in Columbia City (Christian Women's College and Stephens Women's College), which are both famous universities in Missouri. Another Westminster College, in Fulton City, southeast of Columbia, is where Churchill gave his speech on Anglo-American cooperation against the Soviet Union. It is said that the situation of the speech that day was indeed very vivid and intense. President Truman accompanied Churchill by car to Fulton, walking on the streets of Fulton, many of Truman's old friends shouted with rough hands and feet: "Harry! Harry!"

President Truman always smiled, waving his hat as he walked, and greeted his old friends in the countryside: "Hi! James", "Hello! Johnny", "Hi! Tom"! The Hi sounds kept coming. The president of a democratic country is inherently lovely, and a president from the countryside becomes even more lovely when he returns to the countryside. Truman's home is in Independence, Missouri, on the western end of Missouri, near Kansas City. Independence is not Truman's true hometown. His birthplace is in Grandview, thirteen miles from Kansas City. Truman farmed in Grandview in his childhood, so some Missourians still refer to him as a "cowherd," which was Truman's childhood. Later, he left farming and moved to Independence to work as a clerk in Kansas City. Before entering Kansas City, we took a detour to Independence, which is more than 100 miles from Columbia City. At a gas station, Deputy Consul Shen Zuogan asked the gas station attendant about the address of Truman's former residence. The gas station attendant said in a dashing manner: "This is not his home, it is where his mother lives." The car circled in the small streets and alleys of Independence, and finally

found a white clapboard house on Delaware Street. An American flag was firmly planted on the lawn in front of the house, and people who looked like secret police were wandering around guarding it. The people of Independence all know about the president's cottage. A western-style building in front of the house is the county senior high school, and a western-style building behind the house is the junior high school. We didn't stay in Independence for long, and entered Kansas City that evening. Overseas Chinese leader Cai Yiwu booked rooms for us at the Phillips Hotel. Kansas City is the center of the American land, it is a big city in the Midwest, although the name is Kansas, but most of the city still belongs to Missouri, and a small part belongs to Kansas. The two states are bounded by the Missouri River, with 400,000 residents east of the river and only 120,000 residents west of the river. The east side of the river is a prosperous commercial area, and the west side is a factory area. All in all, it is not as large as St. Louis, but the streets are clean, and the buildings are new, giving people a fresh feeling.

The climate in Kansas is particularly good. Although it is mid-summer, it is not as sultry as New York, nor as sticky as Chicago. Before Truman became a federal senator, he worked as a judge in Kansas City. Pandagongsi, one of the "giants" of the Democratic Party, who was the mayor at the time, appreciated Truman who had already become the master of the White House. Pandagongsi was reported for running gambling dens, embezzling money, and eventually died in prison. The people of Kansas all know these stories. A person in the same hotel pointed to a "Clark" hat shop next to the hotel and told me: "Look, this is the shop where Truman worked as a clerk." Every morning at 7:30, Truman would come out of his house and walk to this two-story hat shop." This was not long ago, and only a short time has passed, the mulberry field has become the sea, and the sea has become the mulberry field! (July 13, Kansas City)—End!

If this cannot be resolved this time, we will petition again." The urgency of the problem has reached its final stage. Shou said that Chief Wu Wenguan is familiar with the actual suffering of industry and commerce, and the delegation still needs to have thorough and detailed discussions with the relevant departments. Secretary-General Jiang is also very modest and understands very well. We are sincerely grateful for Chairman Chiang's concern for industry and commerce.

### Li Hongfei Testifies; Claims to Have Been Forced to Oversee Salt Transport

[Report from Our Newspaper] Li Hongfei, Chairman of the "Central China Salt Industry Company," was tried in the High Court yesterday afternoon. Li stated that he was 59 years old and from Ningbo. Before the war, he worked in the salt affairs agency. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he used the Xieji Trading Company to bid for the transportation of 1 million dan of salt from the Salt Affairs Administration. However, due to the fall of Nanjing and Shanghai, the Salt Affairs Administration moved west, so only over 40,000 dan were transported to Hankou. In the winter of the 28th year of the Republic (1939), he planned to use foreign ships to transport a large amount of Huai salt to provide food to the people of Hunan and Hubei. However, because correspondence with the Salt Affairs Administration was seized by the enemy, he was arrested by enemy soldiers on the second day of the first lunar month of the 29th year of the Republic (1940) and released after more than 60 days thanks to Zhou Fohai's intercession. Zhou then appointed him to positions such as Minister of Salt Industry and Director of the Salt Affairs Department, all of which he refused. In the third month of the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), because he was wanted, he took the position of Chairman of the "Central China Salt Transportation Company" and presided over the salt transport business. The company was established during the puppet Provisional Government era. Enemy shares accounted for five-tenths, puppet shares accounted for a little more than four-tenths, and commercial shares accounted for only a little less than one-tenth. The defendant held 100 shares, each worth 50 yuan. Although industrial salt was exported to Japan every month, it was all surplus salt from the domestic salt for the people's consumption, so the monthly export volume was unequal. The enemy's Ministry of Finance also had a price compensation company, which then paid the people. In the eleventh month of the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), the company was reorganized into the China Salt Industry Company, and the supply of industrial salt to the enemy was stopped and the enemy shares were withdrawn. Therefore, the defendant's appointment to the puppet position was actually forced. The court adjourned the case for further investigation.

The joint meeting began at about 3:00 PM, with Zhou Xuexiang and Dai Gengxin (Chairman of Huacheng Tobacco Company), and Pan Mingxin (General Manager of Nanyang Tobacco Company) serving as the presidium. Zhou Xuexiang first reported on the significance of the joint meeting, saying: "Its main purpose is to promote labor-management cooperation and save the endangered cigarette industry. To awaken the labor and management sides of the cigarette industry to this crisis. Currently, factories cannot make money and workers' lives cannot be improved. The crux of the problem is not the issue of wages, but the booming sales of foreign cigarettes. Our production cannot compete with them, and our costs are higher than theirs. If this continues, the cigarette industry will be in danger of not being able to survive. Therefore, today, labor and management should stand on the same front and work hard to cooperate in production. At the same time, we hope that the government can restrict the import of foreign cigarettes and improve the quality of domestic cigarettes to fight against them." Zhou finally said: "Guangdong cigarette factories have been closing down one after another due to the booming sales of foreign cigarettes. If Shanghai counterparts cannot cheer up, they may also suffer the same fate." Dai Gengxin and Pan Mingxin also delivered speeches one after another, all hoping that labor and management can take the spirit of harmony of this joint meeting and work hard to cooperate.

Mayor Wu's Speech

The conference then invited Mayor Wu to give instructions. The Mayor said in warm applause: "Today I am speaking to the compatriots present, not just to the labor side or the management side, which shows that my mood is extremely excited and happy." He then gave examples to illustrate the harmonious labor-management relations in foreign industries, saying: "The old Mr. of the Hansay Chocolate Company in the United States has no family and no personal desires. All profits are completely used to improve labor welfare. In Japan, after the defeat, MacArthur allowed Japanese workers to raise wages, but the union representatives replied that it would be enough if they could have the same wages as before the war, and they did not want to increase them any further, because they deeply understood that today the tools and raw materials for production are both difficult to obtain. If wages are raised again, they will not be able to compete with the foreign goods sold at home and abroad. Therefore, the attitude of labor and management in our country today really needs to be improved." The Mayor then went on to elaborate on the points that labor and management should improve. He said: "First of all, management. In the past, management often did not treat labor as compatriots. Today, the cigarette industry can have close contact between labor and management and hold this harmonious joint meeting, breaking down the previous barriers, which is really commendable, this is one point. In the past, management's accounts have always been kept secret, and they have been strictly kept secret from the government and labor. This is an unnecessary ability. Management uses capital to seek considerable profits, what is the need to hide it, this is the second point. Personnel management should also be improved, and the use of people should be scientific, this is the third point. Speaking of labor, I also have a point of view for the labor side. If the factory closes down, the workers will also lose their jobs. Therefore, the workers and the factory's business are closely related. Why is American tobacco cheap? Because its wages are low and its work efficiency is high, while the efficiency of Chinese workers is not as high as that of the United States, and wages are more expensive than those in the United States. Therefore, the efficiency of Chinese workers should be improved. No matter what position they are in, they should first reflect on themselves. In this unprecedented crisis, management should think about how to be scientific, and labor should often think about how to increase the efficiency of their work. If they shirk each other's responsibilities, the factory will inevitably close down immediately and the workers will lose their jobs immediately."

### Multiple Proposals Passed

Then, Lu Jingshi delivered a speech. Lu proposed the establishment of a factory labor-management conference to seek mutual understanding, so that disputes can be eliminated naturally. Subsequently, Wang Xianqing, Lu Keming, Xie Dahuang, and union representatives gave speeches one after another and immediately passed several proposals: (1) To telegraph the government to reduce the tax rate in order to reduce the cost of domestic cigarettes. (2) To telegraph the government to order tobacco producing areas to improve quality and production. (3) To telegraph all provinces and cities across the country to promote the "Citizens should smoke domestic cigarettes" movement to prevent leaks. (4) To organize the Shanghai Cigarette Industry Labor-Management Cooperation Promotion Committee. (5) To telegraph the government to raise import tariffs on cigarette products in order to maintain the national industry. (6) To plan to hold expanded domestic cigarette promotion in this city. The members of the Shanghai Cigarette Industry Labor-Management Cooperation Promotion Committee were also determined as follows: Management side: Lixing, Zhonghua, Yizhong, Dadong, Huaming, Dadongnan, Huacheng, Nanyang; Labor side: Nanyang Tobacco Workers' Union, Zhonghua Tobacco Workers' Union, Yizhong Tobacco Workers' Union, Huacheng Tobacco Workers' Union, First District Cigarette Workers' Union, Fifth District Tobacco Processing Union, Fourth District Cigarette Workers' Union. After the discussion was completed, the meeting adjourned at about 5:00 PM.

### Xu Haoliang, Leader of the "Thirty-Six Gang," and Others Arrested

[Report from Our Newspaper] Recently, there have been many thefts in the Pujiang area, which were found to be committed by the rogue "Thirty-Six Gang." Mayor Wu received several confidential reports and ordered the Municipal Police Bureau to arrest them. The Police Bureau dispatched detectives from the Criminal Police Detective Division to No. 7 Zengde Lane, Limalu, Nanshi, the day before yesterday, and arrested its leader, Xu Haoliang, and six of his "subordinates": Wei Jün, Le Amao, Lu Aliu, Zhou Tianxiang, and Zhao Heshang. They were taken to the bureau for interrogation. According to their confessions, they organized the "Wangye Company" during the enemy and puppet era, specializing in guarding the wharves and warehouses along the Pu River, and taking the opportunity to steal materials and sell them. Later, they organized the Shengji Transportation Company, and divided the spoils, with the workers getting 60% and the rest 40% for them.

### The Authorities Are Determined to Ban Dance Hostess Managers

[Report from Our Newspaper] After the Municipal Police Bureau ordered the ban on employing dance hostess managers in dance halls, the dance hostess managers panicked. They recently sent representatives to the Municipal Government to petition Mayor Wu. They claimed that they had never engaged in any despicable behavior such as exploiting dance hostesses, and therefore hoped that the authorities would take into account their livelihood and withdraw their order. However, the Municipal Government has authorized the Police Bureau with full authority regarding the ban on dance hostess managers, and the Police Bureau has no precedent for going back on its word, so this move by the dance hostess managers may be in vain.

### Inspection Team Sends Documents to Three Agencies; Closely Monitor Enemy and Puppet Industries

[Report from Our Newspaper] The receiving work inspection team yesterday afternoon sent documents to the garrison command, the gendarmerie command, and the municipal police bureau, requesting that they closely monitor the received or sealed enemy and puppet industries during the inspection period, and that no movement be allowed in order to prevent the escape of materials and concealment of evidence, so as to assist the progress of the inspection work.

Confidential Letters Can Be Divided into Seven Categories

Twenty-eight requests for the return of land, houses, and factories. 3. Seventeen requests for the settlement of confidential reporting bonuses. 4. Seventeen cases of receiving malfeasance. 5. Two requests for the return of vehicles. 6. Twelve cases of missed sealing, concealment, and improper handling of enemy property. 7. Sixteen other cases.

For technical errors, the team will often order the agency to correct them. 3. For policy errors, the team will report to the Control Yuan, which will point out the errors of the highest agency that formulated the policy. The working period of the team was originally 50 days. However, in Shanghai, it is difficult to complete the work even in 100 days, and it will be necessary to extend it for a considerable period of time before it can be concluded.

### Rong Case Kidnapping Suspects Interrogation Completed; Rong Desheng Will Provide a Written Report of the Incident

[Our Paper's Report] The interrogation of all suspects in the Rong case was completed yesterday. The judgment is being drafted and will be announced after being reviewed and approved by the commander. Rong Desheng has submitted a written report detailing his kidnapping and escape. The military court will no longer insist on summoning Rong to court. It is understood that during the interrogation, the watch ticket suspect, Luo Weiquan, recanted his confession, denying that he was watching the medicine. He claimed that he was only a cook, so it was necessary to summon Rong Desheng to court to testify. Now that Rong is unable to come to court and the suspect has failed to provide other evidence, the military court will likely base its verdict on his original confession at the investigation office.

### Forty Minutes Flying Over Shanghai

The C-46 type No. 38 passenger plane, crouching on the runway, was like an arrow fully drawn on a bow, ready to be launched. Its two 1250-horsepower engines roared against the headwind, the deafening noise growing more urgent and tense as the throttle increased. Peering out through the narrow glass window in front of the driver's seat, the 5,000-foot tawny runway looked like a vast springboard, leading to the endless horizon.

The sound of the propellers became so rapid that it seemed about to explode, and my heart felt as if it were tightly squeezed, unable to breathe.

Chief pilot Chen Wenhui and co-pilot Ji Mei re-examined the complex instruments one last time and exchanged a silent "O.K." Chen then gently pushed the control panel forward, and I felt a slight bump. The "tawny springboard" receded rapidly behind us – we were taking off.

I hurriedly looked at my watch; the time was 11:25. Looking back to the left out of the window, there were hangars, planes, more hangars, and more planes... all rushing past like the wind. There was no time for me to think, and the ground was sinking, sinking, sinking below. Trees, houses, temples, rivers, and the boats in the rivers were all shrinking bit by bit.

Each time my heart twinged slightly, I felt the plane rise upward. My eyes were fixed on the altimeter, watching the long needle move from three to four to five hundred feet. We were already over Pudong.

At this point, Chen gently rotated the control panel, and his right foot lightly tapped the right pedal. The horizon below the wing tilted to the right, and I realized that the plane was turning to the left, heading towards downtown Shanghai.

The Huangpu River, running from south to north, reappeared around 11:35. Looking down, this great river looked like a winding mud ditch. The scattered freighters, oil tankers, and sailboats moored on the river looked like models scaled down from their actual size. In just five minutes, I could see the blocks-like high-rise buildings on the Bund: the clock on top of the Jianghai Customs House, and the square, dazzlingly white Central Bank Building, all swept past below the left side of the plane. So small, so small! In the past, when I walked beneath it, it looked down on me with pride. Today, it was just like a child's building block, disappearing beneath my feet.

The tense strings in my heart had long since loosened. In the fifty-odd-foot-long iron belly of the plane, I looked back and forth, as happy as a child. How cool and relaxed the air was! Flying in the sky was truly freedom, so peaceful and stable. I temporarily forgot the suffocation and annoyance of the ground.

The No. 38 plane was fixed at an altitude of 650 feet, smoothly following a grey-tinged road, tilting to the right to make a 180-degree turn, skimming over the Huangpu River, and then flying back towards Pudong. Circling around from Pudong, we flew over the Bund again so that Mr. Gu's camera would have ample time to capture the island scenery of Shanghai.

On the return flight, chief pilot Chen Wenhui continuously pulled the control panel backward, and the plane rose steadily, ascending to 1,000 feet. The speedometer read "160 miles per hour." But I couldn't get any sense of speed. After passing Avenue Joffre, the throttle was turned down, and the altitude quickly decreased. When we descended to two or three hundred feet, the tawny runway reappeared in front of the plane. I immediately regained that sense of speed that caused a slight dizziness. The pointer of the altimeter rapidly retreated to zero, and without realizing it, the landing gear came to rest on the ground.

At 12:05, I returned to the ant-like world of contention. (Shen Shi)

### Shanghai-Nantong Route Passenger Ship "Hangli" Robbed at Liuhekou; Passengers Lost Over Ten Million, Cook Shot

[Our Paper's Report] The Zhonghang Company's "Hangli" vessel, weighing 200 tons, operates between Shanghai, Nantong, and Renjiagang, making round trips every other day. On the 8th, at 6:20 AM, the ship, loaded with passengers and cargo, weighed anchor from Shanghai. There were approximately 280 passengers on board, along with 50 unarmed soldiers. At 7:30, it exited the Wusong estuary and headed north. The weather was clear, and the sailing was smooth, with Captain Li Yuqing personally in command. At about 9:00, when the ship reached the Jiangmian River north of the South Stone in Liuhekou, a man in a black suit holding a Mauser pistol suddenly broke in. Captain Li told him that this was the ship's bridge and asked him to rest in the passenger cabin. Unexpectedly, two more men came in, each drawing Mauser pistols. They told Li that they were guerrillas, numbering more than 30, and had come to borrow some food and supplies. Li was then put under guard by the bandits. At that time, one of the bandits fired a shot into the river. The engine room was forced to stop, and the other bandits, who had been lying in wait, began to search the passengers. On the upper deck, a female passenger was wearing two gold bracelets and two gold rings. The bandits ordered her to take them off, but she refused. The bandits fired a shot at the deck as a warning, and the gold ornaments were still snatched away. Unexpectedly, when the bullet pierced the deck and shot downwards, it hit the cook, Zhu Amao, in three places: the right shoulder, waist, and leg. While the robbery was taking place, a China Merchants Bureau "Jiangli" vessel was being launched, and the bandits mistook it for a warship and became very flustered. Later, a small boat came to their aid. After one of the bandits sounded the alarm, they all fled the ship and sailed away to the northeast. After the shipowner checked the losses, it was found that 1.2 million yuan in cash from the accounting room, including 280,000 yuan sent by a Renjiagang warehouse, had been stolen. Most of the passengers' losses were gold ornaments, and not much cash, worth about 10 million yuan in total. The biggest loss was a single peddler, who had 24 bolts of silk yarn, all of which were stolen. At that time, because there were injured people on board, the captain planned to turn back to Shanghai for medical treatment. However, because the passengers' cash had been stolen, they had no money for accommodation if they returned to Shanghai, so they all demanded to continue north. The shipowner, unable to refuse the wishes of the majority, continued to Renjiagang. The ship returned to Shanghai on time yesterday afternoon. After arriving in Shanghai, Zhu Amao, who had been injured, was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment.

### Letter to the Editor

Respected Editor: I have read the article in your newspaper on the 8th entitled "On Roads Zhizhou and Zhengjiang, People are Shot to Death and Injured". After investigation, it appears that the facts are somewhat different. Last night (the 7th), in front of the Zhijiang Theater, military police were abusing and humiliating officers of our headquarters. Our police officers passed by and intervened to protect the abused officers, resulting in a conflict. The military police used their weapons to attack, and one pistol was taken away from our police officers. This was immediately reported to Captain Zhu of that team, who in turn reported it to our battalion. In order to prevent the situation from escalating, I immediately ordered all companies to close their gates and prohibit entry and exit, and led Captain Zhu with the pistol to the military police headquarters to explain the misunderstanding and return the weapon. At the gate of the Second Company, we encountered Military Police Platoon Leader Wu leading over 20 armed military police officers who had already ambushed the front of the Second Company. I personally apologized to the military police, urged them to stop, and asked the platoon leader to come to the battalion headquarters to resolve the misunderstanding and return the pistol. Unexpectedly, the armed military police at the gate illegally arrested the squad leader of our Second Company in front of the Second Company. When the sentry of our Second Company rushed to the military police and demanded his release, the military police opened fire, instantly killing two of our police officers (who died one after another due to serious injuries). Seeing the disaster they had caused, the military police scattered. At that time, the officers and soldiers of our battalion did not retaliate in order to prevent the situation from escalating. Otherwise, with over 600 armed police officers in our battalion, if we had counterattacked, those few military police officers would not have been able to escape so easily, and Platoon Leader Wu would have been killed on the spot. In addition to reporting the matter to higher authorities by telegram, I would like to state that the newspaper's report of both sides opening fire does not reflect the facts. Please make a correction. Sincerely, Li Mingen, Commander of the Independent Police First Battalion of the Northeast Railway Police Headquarters.

### Jiangsu Province Allows Free Adoption of Secondary School Textbooks

Limited to Those Without Nationally Designated Editions

[Zhenjiang News] The selection of textbooks for secondary schools in Jiangsu is causing much confusion. Because the Suzhou Mingbao newspaper on July 21st mistakenly published a news item stating that the Jiangsu Department of Education had designated the use of several reviewed editions, it caused quite a stir. Yesterday, our reporter interviewed a spokesperson from the Department of Education regarding this matter. According to him, the Department of Education has never issued any official documents designating the use of textbooks for secondary schools. He also said that all books compiled in accordance with the new curriculum standards issued by the Ministry of Education can be freely adopted by each school. On August 5th, this newspaper's Education section published a news article entitled "Jiangsu Province Formulates Supply Methods for Primary and Secondary School Textbooks," which explained in detail that each school is temporarily allowed to freely adopt the reviewed editions of various publishing houses for subjects in junior high school and above that do not have nationally designated editions. This proves that the Department has not designated any secondary school textbooks.

### First Meeting of the District People's Representative Assembly of the Fourth District to be Convened

Since Mr. Ye Zhenquan was elected chairman of the District People's Representative Assembly of the Fourth District in this city, he has spared no effort in promoting the work of the assembly. It is learned that the assembly has decided to convene its first representative assembly from August 25th to 26th to discuss matters related to reform within the district. It is heard that notices have been issued to each representative and public announcements have been posted to broaden public opinion. It is expected that there will be a heated discussion during the meeting.

### Residents of the Eighth Block of the Second District Self-Fund the Repair of Pingwang Street

Pingwang Street in the Eighth Block of the Second District has been in disrepair for a long time, and the road surface is uneven. After it rains, there are places where water accumulates. Therefore, the block chief, Hua Wenqing, and others initiated a self-funded repair project. After submitting a request to the District Office and the Bureau of Public Works for contact, the required expenses of over 600,000 were automatically donated by the residents of the block. The project is contracted by the Bureau of Public Works and has started today.

The Second District Office of this city held its third district affairs meeting at 3 PM on the seventh (the day before yesterday), presided over by District Chief Li Ruchun. There was a detailed discussion on simplifying the handling of official documents and the attendance of staff. It is also planned to organize a roving supervisory team to regularly supervise the offices of each block to achieve work results.

### Seventeenth District Repairs Bridges

The Linping Road Bridge in the Seventeenth District (North Sichuan Road) is an important transportation hub. Affected by years of war, it has suffered great damage and is in danger of collapsing, urgently requiring repair. In addition, the Gujiawan Bridge was demolished by the enemy and puppets and has not yet been rebuilt, causing inconvenience to pedestrians. The District Office, at the request of local residents, sent personnel to investigate and confirmed the facts. It has already submitted a special report to the Bureau of Public Works to separately survey and repair it to facilitate transportation.

Also, the population of the Third Block of the Seventeenth District has increased sharply, reaching 61 jia and 1,677 households, exceeding the original standard of 30 jia per block by too much, making it inconvenient to carry out block affairs. The District Office has already submitted a report to the Municipal Government for approval to divide the Third Block into two blocks and is now preparing an expanded compilation table and a colored map of the divided blocks for review.

### Private Real Estate Transactions Require Certification by Autonomous Organizations

Suggestion from the District People's Representative Assembly of the Third District

The District People's Representative Assembly of the Third District (Yumiao) believes that private real estate transactions in this city have never been certified by autonomous organizations. Whenever disputes arise and lawsuits are filed in court, when the local autonomous organization is required to provide impartial certification, it is difficult to provide evidence due to a lack of understanding of the situation. It is also impossible to investigate and defend, and there is no basis for a reply. This situation should be remedied and is essential. Therefore, it is proposed that in the future, land and housing transactions must be certified by the district block before they can be transferred. The district block personnel live in the same neighborhood as each household and have a deep understanding of the private secrets of the people. They can clearly understand who owns the property. When it is necessary to provide certification, bias can be avoided. Moreover, abuses such as selling with false identification and reselling the same property multiple times can be reduced. Therefore, the proposal that private real estate transactions should be certified by autonomous organizations was submitted to the first District People's Representative Assembly meeting of the district. The proposal was passed and submitted to the Municipal Government for approval.

### Thirty-Second District Distributes Flour Regularly

The Thirty-Second District (Zhenru) convened a meeting at the District Office at 9 AM yesterday to distribute relief flour. It was originally planned to distribute it on the same day, but because the district will hold the election of municipal senators on the 11th and is busy with preparations, it cannot be completed in time. Therefore, it was changed to complete the distribution in the district before the 16th.

The Thirty-Second District will elect municipal senators tomorrow and has selected Guanlong Elementary School, Zhenru Elementary School, Yangjiaqiao Pengcheng Branch School, the bridgehead at No. 1 Zhenbei Road, and Huaxia Elementary School as polling places. The Municipal Government's Civil Affairs Department has also sent five election supervisors to supervise the elections at each polling place. All impartial gentry and district people's representatives in the district will be present to assist in order to show solemnity.

(47) Question: If a man is under 18 years old and a woman is under 16 years old get married, can they be allowed to register?

### Heavy Interest on Loans and Excessive Expenses High-Interest Loans Also Cannot Be Supported Pawnbroking Industry Still Has 760 Businesses

[Reported by this newspaper] Pawnbroking was originally one of the financial institutions that regulated the finances of commoners. Therefore, all business facilities are ultimately aimed at meeting the welfare of the people. However, after the war, with the soaring prices of all goods, the business of general pawnbroking also changed rapidly. The pawn period was shortened daily, and the pawn interest increased daily. The situation became even worse during the occupation of the enemy and puppets. Illegal small pawnshops in disguise sprang up everywhere. The pawn period was shortened to one month, and the pawn interest was as high as five cents or more. After the victory, the pawn and pawnshop industries in this city were ordered to establish a reorganization committee. After active preparations, the Pawnbroking Commercial Guild was officially established on March 5th of this year. After the establishment of the guild, the pawn and pawnshop industries have been merged into one.

Two Months for Maturity First Month 4 Cents and 6

Months ago, the industry stipulated that the pawn period should be uniformly two months, with a grace period of five days. The pawn interest was 2.7 cents per yuan per month, the storage fee was 4 cents, and the handling fee was 1.5 cents, for a total of 4.6 cents. However, the handling fee is only charged once in the first month, and not counted thereafter, so the total for the second month is 3.1 cents. On average, the interest and expenses per yuan per month for two months are approximately slightly less than 4 cents.

At this time, when high-interest loans are prevalent, some say that the current standard of interest taken by the pawnbroking industry is also a kind of high-interest loan, and it is necessary to increase crackdown. The reporter specifically asked the competent department of the Social Affairs Bureau about this matter. According to the reply: The Social Affairs Bureau has long paid attention to the current interest-taking method of the pawnbroking industry. As far as the department is concerned, it hopes that the industry will adjust the current interest-taking standard. This matter is also felt to be necessary within the industry itself. And is willing to reduce the monthly interest per yuan to 2.5 cents, the storage fee remains the same at 4 cents, and the handling fee is changed to 7 cents per month. According to the person in charge, the industry regulations originally did not have explicit provisions for the handling fee item, and it should have been cracked down on. However, in order to take care of the livelihood of the pawnbroking staff, who rely on handling fees as an important part of their monthly income, it is still retained.

Retaining Handling Fee Reduced to 3 Cents and 6

After this adjustment, the interest and expenses per yuan per month have been reduced to 3.6 cents. The industry association is currently drafting a report for submission to request adjustment, which is expected to be approved and implemented soon. According to the person in charge's estimation, the interest on general bank loans before the war was only 7 or 8%, while the interest and expenses of pawnbroking at that time totaled 2 cents and some change. It was approximately 130 to 150% higher than the fixed interest of banks. Now, the interest on general loans has reached 1.5 or 1.6 cents. And this time, the pawnbroking industry is willing to reduce the interest and expenses to 3.6 cents. According to the proportion of the increasing interest on bank loans, this reduction in pawn interest is still considered reasonable. In the future, the Social Affairs Bureau will consider the actual situation and gradually reduce the pawn interest to maintain the livelihood of the commoners.

The reporter then visited several people in the pawnbroking industry to inquire about the recent situation of the industry. It is learned that the pawnbroking industry has been repeatedly affected by currency changes, soaring prices, and high dark interest since the outbreak of the war. Every time the currency system changes, the capital of the pawnbroking industry shrinks invisibly. Before the war, a small pawnshop operating with 10,000 yuan could cope with the situation quite comfortably. Now, after eight years of the War of Resistance and two changes of currency system, this capital of 10,000 yuan has almost disappeared. In addition, with prices soaring again and again, taking valuables from borrowers with increasingly shrinking limited capital is no less than being attacked from both sides.

Capital Too Weak All Businesses Changed Careers

During periods of soaring prices, it is often the case that when borrowers pawn items and when they prepare funds to redeem the goods several months later, the items seem to have soared several times in price. Therefore, even with a high interest rate of 5 cents, it is not enough to compensate for the devaluation of the currency. For this reason, in recent years, it has been impossible for general normal pawnbroking businesses to maintain their original capital, let alone make a profit. Furthermore, according to the general situation of the pawnbroking industry, the majority of the "jia ben" (i.e., the total amount of pawned loans) is borrowed from relatives, friends, or various merchants. The interest on these borrowed funds is mostly above 2 cents. Therefore, the interest cost of borrowed funds is already high, and adding the necessary expenses for the business itself, the pawn interest cannot be lowered. Today, of the 760 pawnbroking businesses in the city, 90% are invested and operated by people outside the industry. And the original operators have mostly been eliminated due to the above-mentioned reasons. Of the hundreds of businesses currently operating, the vast majority have capital below one million yuan. However, the "jia ben" varies greatly, ranging from only several hundred thousand to more than 20 million yuan. However, those with extremely high "jia ben" are extremely rare.

Only One or Two Tickets per Day Already Tastes Like Difficulty

According to the current situation of storefronts, pawnbroking businesses with only one or two tickets per day are everywhere. Some even guard all day without a single ticket coming in. On the one hand, the interest on borrowed funds and all operating expenses still have to be paid. Therefore, people in the industry all say that the current stage of the pawnbroking industry is like a chicken rib. The only hope is that the business can improve again, then it can still be maintained. Otherwise, the future of the pawnbroking industry will probably be bleak.

### Gold Note Trading Flat

The red market was even more mediocre yesterday. It opened flat in the morning. After opening, it once rose from 1.915 million to 1.925 million, but there were not many transactions. The buying momentum stopped there. The Central Bank distributed 4 or 5 bars at a price of 1.9175 million. After 10 o'clock, it fell back to 1.913 million and then stagnated. At noon, it hovered between 1.915 million and 1.92 million. In the afternoon, the asking price still showed weakness. As a result, it closed slightly lower by 4,000 compared to the previous session. Gold ornaments, silver bullion, and silver dollars all lacked movement. The supply and demand of gray market money was balanced, and gray market interest rates ranged from 1 cent to 1.3 cents.

Foreign currency US dollars remained extremely sluggish. At the beginning of the morning, the price was around 2,515 yuan, and it rose slightly to 2,530 yuan midway, which increased the supply. At noon, it struggled around 2,520 yuan. In the afternoon, it weakened slightly, and the demand for supply was still low, to the point of being mediocre. Those who store foreign currency moved to Hong Kong dollar activities, which led to this. As a result, it closed slightly lower by 10 yuan compared to the previous session. The supply of Hong Kong dollar chips was surprisingly scarce, and it alone showed stability. As a result, it closed slightly higher by 2 yuan compared to the previous session. The exchange rate for Hong Kong dollars was 550 yuan to 555 yuan, the exchange rate for Indian rupees was 663 yuan to 68 yuan, and the exchange rate for British pounds was 8,850 yuan to 9,000 yuan. Trading was slightly more active, which made the US dollar market appear cold and inactive.

### Customer and Cargo Registration Did Not See a Decrease The Rising Trend in the Rice Market Is Still Difficult to Stop

Yesterday, a total of more than 8,900 dan of rice arrived in the north and south markets. High-quality japonica rice was firm. Medium and low grades continued to rise by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan due to the strong demand from retailers. The supply and demand of indica rice was relatively balanced. High-quality goods were slightly scarce. Medium and secondary station rice was in short supply, and new products were pending. Retail sales were still acceptable, and prices rose by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. New japonica rice arrivals were not many. The weather was hot, and rice porridge sales were brisk, rising by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Flour retailers were active but not strong. Factory prices stepped down slightly and followed the decline. Prices continued to weaken by 100 to 200 yuan. The situation was still lacking in spirit and it was difficult to prosper. Miscellaneous brands traded sparsely. There was still continued sale of foreign flour, and the quality was very good. Wheat customer cargo was active but not strong. Only Quanzhou in Fujian took a small amount. Qingdao gangs still picked white wheat. The market trend was weak, with price decreasing by 300 to 500 yuan. Factories lacked transactions due to the daily decline in flour prices. Bran also followed the decline by 100 to 200 yuan. Soybean consumption declined and oil factories' purchases were weak. New sources of supply continued. Prices continued to decline by another 500 to 1,000 yuan. Broad beans were being sold off at reduced prices. Sales of raw kernels were sluggish. Although the owners were firm, the rare trading made the market trend obviously weak and secretly declining. The retail sales in the oil market were still active. Arrivals of raw oil were not many. Sales were dry and brisk, and prices rose by 1,000 yuan. Factories continued to supply soybean oil and the trend was standing up. Rapeseed oil rose slightly by 500 to 600 yuan. A small amount of soybean oil came from the northeast and Longhai Line ports. The later situation was not overly inflated. Countryside consumption of soybean cake was increasingly weak. Arrivals came from Hankou and Yingkou. The market was not prosperous and declined by another 200 to 300 yuan.

### Pig Bristle Exports First Improve Quality Next Reduce Costs

Only 200 dan of pig bristles from Hankou and Shanghai were traded this month for export. Sichuan bristles were unmoved. According to industry insiders, the key to pig bristles in the future is not the changes in prices in foreign markets, but improving quality to maintain the market. If foreign prices are better but the quality is poor, it is useless. The second is to reduce costs. If convenient transportation, tax exemptions, and changes to the dock cannot be achieved, reducing costs is impossible. The current quality has been greatly improved. The fullness of Sichuan bristles has exceeded 95%, Hankou bristles have reached 70%, and Shanghai bristles have also reached 40%, all of which meet foreign needs. The US government has a large inventory, estimated at 9.9 million pounds. There are also news of sales, so the sales of Chinese pig bristles in the United States are slightly affected. The UK has never needed a large quantity, and its style is to hold on. People in the industry are not interested in transactions with the UK.

On the 3rd of this month, 200 boxes of Sichuan bristles were transported east from Chongqing by the Minsheng Company's Minxiang Wheel. There were still arrivals one after another. The 2,700 dan of Sichuan bristles stored here were sorted out and shipped out in July, and another 900 dan were being sorted out and could be shipped out in the short term.

### Fertilizer and Other Goods Shipped to Hong Kong

[Reported by this newspaper] 5,000 bags of fertilizer, 5 automobiles, and more than 200 pieces of cargo were loaded onto the Taikoo Company's Niuzhuang and Yuezhou ships and exported to Hong Kong today.

### Rayon Returns to Flat Factory and Merchant Trading Quiet

The rayon market gradually stabilized yesterday. 120 type Tian opening had a price of 1.55 million yuan, and quickly rose to 600,000 yuan. The closing price was 610,000 yuan, 20,000 yuan higher than the previous afternoon. The market price in the afternoon did not change much. The price of 120 type miscellaneous brand was also 10,000 yuan higher. The prices of other types of goods were called up to the original market price of the previous day. Most of them were never traded. The factory and merchant market was quiet. There were some transactions for users. The price of five dan of ordinary goods ranged from 1.8 million to 1.9 million yuan, and another dan was priced at 1.7 million to 1.75 million yuan. No transactions were heard for dry merchants. The prices of silk goods were mostly stable without any ups and downs. Huajin crepe was in greater demand than supply, and the price rose by another 50 yuan yesterday.

### Yarn Market Sees Ups and Downs Spot Cotton Follows US Cotton's Rise

The yarn market was more peaceful than usual yesterday. 20s saw ups and downs in each brand and trading was still extremely light. Only Tianjin gangs bought a small amount of Red Chief Star and other medium-sized yarn. The sales on the Beijing-Shanghai line were sluggish, and the sale of small yarn was particularly blocked. The Textile Construction Company opened yarn as usual at noon, with a total of 30 kinds ranging from 1s to 80s. The listed price was not much different from the previous period.

Yesterday, the New York US cotton telegraph suddenly soared by more than 130 points. The near-term price of US dollars was 35.86, and the new flower far-term price was 32.78. The Middling spot price broke the previous peak price (36.47) and opened at 36.66. Spot cotton trading in this port was still smooth. Shenxin Third Factory and Xinsheng Fu'an Dacheng and other factories purchased it. Stimulated by the soaring price of US cotton, the market price rose by another 2,000 to 3,000 yuan.

Grey cloth continued to increase, V Dragon Head was particularly popular. Civil-run Dapeng, Dangui, and Southern's demand were prosperous. The prices above all rose by more than 1,000 yuan. Shilin cloth gradually improved, but serge remained in a fatigued situation.

### Zhongnan Insurance Moves to Shanghai Qiu Hanping Appointed General Manager

[Reported by this newspaper] Zhongnan Youxian Company enjoys a good reputation in this place and has decided to increase its capital and move to Shanghai in order to expand its business. Yesterday, a joint meeting of directors and supervisors was held, and Huang Yiqi was removed as director and Qiu Hanping was appointed as general manager.

### Domestic Sales of Tea Market Remain Strong, Foreign Firms' Interest Somewhat Slackened

Recently, since the Swedish ship "Bali" loaded over 7,000 boxes of Chinese tea and sailed from this city overseas, exporters have been busy with all the procedures. As a result, their interest in purchasing has somewhat slackened. In the whole city, only Jardine Matheson and Wu Chang, two Chinese tea companies, have together taken in less than 1,000 boxes of Taiwan black tea, aged medium grades, aged lower grades, small-leaf black tea, and aged needle-leaf tea. However, the process remains very stable. It is reported that there is demand from European and American countries for Fujian small-leaf tea and aged "Chou Zhen" tea, but prices are not generous enough, making it difficult to sell them for the time being. As for domestic sales of black and green tea, they have not shown any signs of decline. "Bao Zhong" flower tea is particularly popular in Yingkou, Shandong, and other places, rising to 72,000-73,000 yuan per dan. Other varieties are consistently firm.

### Overbought Positions Released, Major Players Actively Enter, Wing On Shares Trade Most

The Chinese stock market situation is abnormal. A major player has vigorously entered Wing On shares, buying no less than 3 million shares. However, because the bulls in the industry are profiting and taking gains, supply and demand are roughly equal, preventing a dramatic rise. Overbought positions are too crowded, and there was a sudden sell-off at noon, causing a widespread decline. At one point, high-priced Wing On shares were at 723 yuan, Mei Ya at 4150 yuan, Jingfu and Xinguang both at 240 yuan, and Qinxing at 172 yuan. Less popular small and medium-sized stocks had already opened lower and gradually declined. Old shares were also weak and unable to rise, repeatedly seeing lower prices. Judging from the situation, there is still a sense of being top-heavy. All closed at low prices at noon, with Wing On shares down 5 yuan compared to the previous close, Mei Ya down slightly at 180 yuan, Jingfu and Xinguang already at break-even, and Qinxing also down more than half a percent. Less popular small and medium-sized stocks were down about half a percent each. There was no lack of supply for old shares, and many were seen at lower prices. After the close, Wing On shares continued to be bid lower in the over-the-counter market.

Foreign stocks did not trade much. Popular stocks are still struggling. Jardine Matheson initially reached 8200, but quickly faltered and returned to the previous closing price. Small stocks showed a slight recovery due to some short covering and a stable trend. As a result, Jardine Matheson and British American Tobacco closed flat compared to the previous close, and the others showed slight gains.

### Listing Securities to Be Examined Starting Today

[Our Report] The Securities Exchange Subcommittee's work of examining broker qualifications has now come to an end. The Securities Exchange Preparatory Committee was originally scheduled to convene a full preparatory committee meeting at 9:00 AM yesterday. However, due to President Song's visit to Shanghai and the Bank Association's meeting, many committee members were unable to attend, so the meeting was rescheduled to 9:00 AM this morning. It is said that the committee will review the subcommittee's audit process and determine the number of qualified brokers, with some suggesting that it may be reduced to 200. Approval from the ministry is expected next week. Also, starting today, the Listed Securities Examination Subcommittee will begin examining the listing securities applications that have already been submitted (reportedly more than 30 types). Meanwhile, it will continue to accept applications from various companies, so that they can be submitted to the ministry for approval and announced together before the securities exchange opens.

### Jiangsu-Zhejiang Wheat Loan Syndicate Holds Inaugural Meeting Yesterday

The 30 billion yuan flour and wheat loan approved by the 311th board meeting of the Four Banks Joint Office, the Fourth District Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Wheat Loan Syndicate, held its inaugural meeting at the Bank of Communications conference room at 3:00 PM yesterday. In addition to representatives from the Central Bank and the Four Banks branch offices, responsible persons from the three banks, two bureaus, and commercial banks and money shops attended. Pan Zhonglin of the Bank of Communications was elected chairman. The organizational regulations for the Fourth District Wheat Loan Syndicate and the members' loan agreement, wheat loan pledge overdraft, and transfer pledge overdraft agreement were approved. Furthermore, it was learned that, as of yesterday, in addition to the Tingsu Farmers Bank, which had already recognized 2 billion yuan in loans, 31 commercial banks accounted for a total of 1.09 billion yuan in recognized loans, and 49 money shops joined, with a total of 1.08 billion yuan in recognized loans. Due to the suddenness of the matter, representatives from the commercial banks had not yet been elected. Once they are selected, a committee will be established, divided into groups and departments, and will begin work immediately. The meeting will be convened around next Monday or Tuesday. The future chairman and vice chairman will be Pan Zhonglin of the Bank of Communications and Ji Yao of the Central Farmers Bank. The committee members will be Pan Jiufen (Bank of China), Shen Shuping (Postal Savings Bureau), Zhong Long (China Trust Bureau), and Xu Wenqing (representative of the money shops), among others.

Sugar Prices Slightly Firmer

Yesterday, the sugar market trend turned firmer. Shantou's "Ti Qing", high-grade goods were at 94,000 yuan, extra high-grade at 95,000-96,000 yuan, and "Ban Nan Qing" at 91,000-92,000 yuan, with over 200 bags transacted. Cotton red was at 123,000 yuan for 30 bags. Jianbang's "Kai Bai Bao", "Diao Qing" was at 90,000 yuan for 50 bags, and the next grade at 89,000 yuan. Xinghua's "Kai Zhong Zhuang Gong Fen Bai" was at 128,000 yuan, and "Xing Chi" at 115,000-116,000 yuan, with over 60 bags transacted.

Domestic Bonds Slightly Up

A major player on the fifth floor of the public bond market switched from Grade E to Grade C, resulting in a situation where Grades A, B, and C were flat, while Grades D and E were weaker. When the market opened in the morning, Domestic Bond C opened flat. A firm on the seventh floor slightly sold off, dropping to a low of 600 yuan mid-session, before bargain hunters stepped in to stabilize the market at noon. As a result, Grades A and B closed flat compared to the previous close, Domestic Bond C was up 20 yuan, Grade D was up slightly by 20 yuan, and Domestic Bond E was down 50 yuan.

### News Tax Alliance Under Organization in Netherlands and Belgium

[Reuters, Brussels, 9th] Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg are organizing a joint international trade group. A joint secretariat has been established in Brussels, along with three committees, one of which is the Customs Committee. It is working to draft a customs tariff for the three countries to jointly abide by. After being passed by the parliaments of the three countries, a customs union will be formed on November 1st of next year. There will be no tariff barriers between the three countries, and they will form a single unit for the rest of the world.

### Xinhua Department Store Increases Capital

Total Amount is 75 Million

Xinhua Department Store held a shareholders' meeting at the YMCA yesterday, presided over by General Manager Li Yan[illegible]. The issue of increasing capital was discussed and it was resolved to increase the original capital of 7.5 million yuan to 75 million yuan (i.e., increasing each share by nine shares). The company operates the Xinhua Underwear Factory, the Xiongdi Chemical Industry Factory, the Hongmian Sock Factory, and the Xinkang Office, and is very developed.

### Implied Prohibition Through Taxation: Eating and Playing Are Allowed, As Long As Tax Obligations Are Met

When you smoke an American cigarette, do you know its cost? Let me tell you, the cost to a cigarette merchant for ordering a pack of 20 Marlboro cigarettes from the United States is 7 US cents. Assuming an exchange rate of 2,500 yuan, the cost is only 175 yuan, but the import tax paid to customs is 250% of the purchase price.

That is 437 yuan and 50 cents.

Domestic cigarettes have a factory tax, which is 100%. Beer also has a factory tax of 200%, as does local wine. This is of course a restriction on tobacco and alcohol, or perhaps it can be said to be an implied prohibition through taxation. But other industries also often have to pay a large amount of taxes and fees. For example, in Shanghai's restaurant industry, the various tax obligations they bear from the time they open a business are as follows:

Business license tax (taxed by grade)

Business tax (1.5 per thousand)

Income tax (3 per thousand)

Excess profits tax

Banquet tax (20 out of 120)

Among them, the banquet tax is the most substantial. Those with music and dance floors are also calculated as dance halls and cafes, with a tax rate of 30 out of 130. If you drink a bottle of beer or eat a cup of ice cream, there is also a liquor tax or cold drink license fee added. Of the 400 small noodle restaurants in the city, 500 are exempt from the banquet tax. The remaining 500 or so members of the Restaurant Industry Association are all subject to taxation, even those who specialize in set meals and rice dishes. (Because they sometimes serve cold appetizers and stir-fries, which are said to be eaten by rich people and should be taxed.)

Don't underestimate this small banquet tax. The city government's largest source of revenue relies on it. Revenue in July, according to published figures, reached 1.5 billion yuan, ranking first among municipal revenue. The city's entertainment tax is the second largest figure, exceeding 1.3 billion yuan. It is collected on ticket prices for movies, dramas, Peking operas, etc. The tax rate was previously 50% of the ticket price, but was reduced to 40% in August (for August only). So when you buy a 1,500 yuan theater ticket and enter the cinema, you can rest assured, because one-third of it has already fulfilled your responsibility as a small citizen to the city government.

### On the Yangzhou-Taizhou Line, Trip to Northern Jiangsu (II)

— Our Correspondent, Hangzhou, Yangzhou Dispatch, 4th

The luxurious shadow of ancient Yangzhou has disappeared in the ruthless ages; now, it is a military city.

Fortresses are built high at the city gate, and the guarding soldiers’ machine guns are observing the front, with no [illegible]. Pedestrians must accept strict inspections.

The Communist army is on the offensive in northern Jiangsu, and Yangzhou is under their menacing gaze. The good residents entrust everything to the National Army that defends them. They trust the strength of the National Army and obey military management. This city gains stability in tension.

However, stability cannot hide desolation and misery. The hotel where the reporter stayed has more than 300 rooms, but only three people are staying there now. The doors of the stores are open, and there are quite a few goods on display, but only clerks are seen dozing off behind the counters. The number of people has not decreased, but has increased; what has increased are the refugees in tattered clothes who have been “struggled” out, making Yangzhou even more miserable.

The total data on refugees is 40,000. These people have replaced the noble tourists of the past. The Ministry of Social Affairs has established 22 reception centers here to provide relief, so that they do not starve to death. I visited several reception centers and discovered a previously undiscovered fact: the refugees who were “liberated” by the Communist Party in the so-called “liberated areas” of northern Jiangsu used to be relatively wealthy people, but now they are poor farmers and workers—those “masses” of whom the Communist Party boasts—who are also fleeing together.

### Two and a Half Dan of Harvested Rice Seized from Three

A 39-year-old poor farmer said angrily:

"They gave me three and a half mu of land, and I thought I could live a good life; who knew that they would seize two and a half dan of the three dan rice harvest, how can I live like this?"

The Communist Party's revolutionary means are violent. It fundamentally denies everything inherent, hoping to change China's color all at once. On this point, it is destined to fail. The people in the so-called "liberated areas" are now like being suspended in mid-air: everything old, even the patriarchal relationships that the Chinese people value most, has been destroyed without a trace; and for the new, they only see a kind of devouring like a flood of wild beasts, to swallow their entire humanity in the Party's endless desires. Ignorant farmers and workers are gradually understanding; so, they are also fleeing.

That middle-aged farmer also told me a fact—

A government official was captured by the Communist army and called a "Nationalist spy" or "stubborn element" and was to be executed. This punishment has a strange name called "firing a cannon." This is a more cruel atrocity than the atrocities committed by the Japanese army during the War of Resistance.

In an open space, the Communist army ordered that person to dig a pit in the mud and jump down. Then, two soldiers came up and piled the soil back into the mud pit. When it was piled to that person's knees, the upper body was already turning purple; when it was piled to the chest, the face was completely black; then it was piled up, and there was a loud bang, and the crown of that person's head rushed straight into the sky, and blood spurted out like a volcanic eruption for more than two zhang high. —— Heaven! This is "firing a cannon!"

The refugees' stimulus to Yangzhou is great. What this reflects is the close cooperation between the Party, government, merchants, people, and the military.

### The Situation is Improving; Both Arms Are Extended

The other aspect of the expression is depression. Most of the land properties of the wealthy merchants in Yangzhou include "salt." Now that business is not good, they are endlessly sitting in teahouses every day in boredom. "Fuchun" and "Yiyuan" are two famous ones, which are also the gathering places for the upper class. Tea guests carefully taste tea, gently wave their fans, slowly chew food, and utter a wish, "Will the situation be better next month!"

The situation is indeed improving. After the National Army began its counterattack, the Yangzhou-Taizhou and Yangzhou-Tianchang roads were opened one after another. With both arms extended, it can breathe a sigh of relief. Now people are paying attention to the front, especially Shaobo and Gaoyou.

This breath is still far from restoring prosperity. More than one hundred prostitutes decorate this desolate city, with business desolately light. Seductive stories belong to the distant past! Today, the setting sun accompanies the lonely pagoda by the Slender West Lake, and old monks count flying fireflies in Little Jinshan. I stand on the Five Pavilion Bridge and call out to Yangzhou: "Return my youth"!

### Taixing and Taixian are a Pair of Difficult Brothers

The two Tai are a pair of difficult brothers.

When I went from Yangzhou to Taixing, the Yangzhou-Taizhou road had just been recovered and was not yet open to traffic. I took the road to Kouan. Mr. Wang Gongyu, Director of the Civil Affairs Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, accompanied me.

We arrived in Zhenjiang first. The Kouan ferry did not leave until 2:30 PM. The wind and waves in the Yangtze River were very strong that day, but fortunately we had a tailwind and tailwater. We transferred to a car at Kouan and arrived in Taixing before dark.

Taixing had just gone through a major battle. I had already seen and smelled the traces of war, and the smell of war, when I was still some distance away from it. Of the four gates, east, west, north, and south, only the west gate was open, and the guard was stricter than in Yangzhou. The soldiers ordered our car to stop, and a squad leader walked over.

### The Disaster Victims After the Robbery Await the Government's Comfort

"Where are you from"?

We told him.

"There is an order from above: no one is allowed to enter the city without permission!" he said sternly; then, he mildly expressed that he would ask the regimental commander for instructions.

After a while, the political instructor of the regimental headquarters and the county magistrate, the director of the Party Department, and other people came out of the city in a long line to welcome Director Wang [illegible]. I, the reporter, also enjoyed the benefit. There were only sparse residents in the city. But soon, the national flag was already hung all over the streets, and some people set off firecrackers. This shows how the disaster victims after the robbery expect the government's comfort.

We were received in the county bank that had not yet opened, which was probably the only relatively complete place here, but it was so crude! I say this without any contempt. On the contrary, I am with respect; I know that they—everyone who works in this city—are working hard.

The hero of defending the city, Regimental Commander Liu Guangyu, we were just about to visit him, but he came first. A military uniform wrapped a sturdy body, and laughed excitedly before speaking. Talking about the course of the battle, he was fascinated, eloquent, gesticulating, vaguely like the expression when directing the battle.

I have already reported on the Battle of Taixing. Here I only write about the inspection process.

The next day, I made a pilgrimage throughout the city. This is not like a city. The degree of desolation is just like a village in the mountains. There are not many decent shops, and the food shops only sell fried dough sticks and large cakes.

The destruction outside the city gate is even more severe, and there are broken walls everywhere. You can still smell the bloody smell in a city river.

The relief work is complicated. I am anxious for the Ministry of Social Affairs. A drop in the bucket, what can it do!

### Division Commander Li Tianxia has the Style of an American General

After that, we went to Taixian.

Division Commander Li Tianxia of the 83rd Division is sitting in Taixian. This is a lively and cheerful soldier, and leading troops has some American style. There are various entertainments in the army, and the soldiers get full spiritual life, showing a piece of vitality. When fighting, it is powerful.

Due to the liveliness of Division Commander Li, Taixian city also became lively. The war news followed the liveliness, and after Qutang was recovered, it joined forces with Hai'an and advanced to Dongtai. Division Commander Li said that he would share the joy with the people. Unfortunately, I had already left Taixian and could not participate in the grand event. The magistrate of Taixian, Ding Zuobin, people call him a "model magistrate." Indeed, of the several magistrates I saw in northern Jiangsu! Zhang Jichuan of Yangzhou, Xue Peiqi of Taixing, and Ding Zuobin of Taixian, all deserve to be called good magistrates. They haven't reached the time to "do bad things." Everything is most important for local stability. The Communist army's militia is constantly destroying and harassing, which makes them most headache. Mr. Wang Gongyu said with emotion: "I must find a way to increase the local military force, at least to the point where we can use our local force to deal with the local force of the Communist army!"

### Precious Island Taiwan

— Our Newspaper's Taiwan Airmail Report from the 4th, Special Correspondent Jiang Muyun

In a cafeteria next to Taipei Station where I was eating a "set meal," I encountered a visitor from the capital who had flown across the Taiwan Strait. He suddenly asked, "What's really going on in Taiwan? Shanghai newspapers are scolding it harshly!" I calmly replied, "Taiwan has lovable aspects and hateful aspects! You can only understand it after living here for a long time."

Transition Period:

Inevitable Transitional Phenomena

After parting with him, I thought that although Taiwan had been recovered for almost a year, people at home and abroad didn't clearly understand this new land. Even among those working on the ground and most Taiwanese people, probably not many had a clear understanding. This is not regrettable, people say it's a transitional phenomenon of the transition period.

When the Portuguese landed on this island of Taiwan, witnessing the beauty of its mountains, rivers, and natural features, they called it "Formosa." Foreigners continued to refer to it as the "Beautiful Island." Fifty-one years ago, when the Treaty of Shimonoseki was signed, China presented it to Japan. Japan, lacking subtropical land and harboring ambitions for southward expansion, used Taiwan as a base and a supply depot for its rear. It exploited Taiwan to the fullest extent, extracting its industrial and commercial resources under colonial economic policies to supply Japan. Japan took from it inexhaustibly, thus praising it as a "Precious Island," "Warehouse," and "Treasure House." These terms were heavily laden with the implication of exploitation!

Developing to:

The Saturation Point of the Taiwan Island

Taiwan doesn't have anything that can be truly considered a "treasure." If we have to point out "treasures," we can only point to certain special products: rice, sugarcane, tea, bananas, pineapples, forests, and others. Rice production is about eight to nine million "shi" per year, with about four million "shi" exported annually, all supplied to Japan. In the future, this can supplement the food supply of Fujian and Guangdong. But it should be noted that the arable land throughout the province has been developed by the Japanese to 22.2%, similar to the intensive farmland in the Jiangnan area. The farmland surface cannot be expanded further and requires more fertilizer and labor. Sugarcane cultivation has been partially converted to rice fields, so rice production should not decrease. Although sugar production is greatly reduced at present, it is hoped that it will occupy a place in the world market in the future, and China's 450 million people can also avoid relying on foreign countries for sugar. Tea cannot restore its original output, and the overseas market is encountering a high-cost crisis. However, it needs to be planned in conjunction with the national tea industry. Other subtropical crops, such as fruits, share the same characteristics as the subtropical agricultural regions of Fujian and Guangdong in China's vast area and cannot be regarded as Taiwan's "treasure." Because Taiwan is a sedimentary rock formation from the Tertiary period, with volcanic rock distributed only in the northeast, its underground resources are not abundant, especially iron, which is not produced. Although the Japanese began to establish mechanical and chemical industries, either crude products relied on Japan, or the finished products still supplied Japan. The production process of any department is incomplete, and some are completely to meet wartime needs! Therefore, Taiwan doesn't have a "treasure." The aspect in which it is superior to Fujian and Guangdong is the construction foundation of the Japanese. However, it is approaching its saturation point and doesn't have the same promising future as Guangdong's Hainan Island.

Maintaining:

The Hearts of Six Million People

Taiwan currently has a population of 6.3 million. Except for 130,000 indigenous people from Malaya, most are from Quanzhou and Zhangzhou, and a small portion are from Hakka and various parts of Guangdong. The first wave of immigrants in the late Ming Dynasty were pirates. The second wave were remnants opposing the Qing Dynasty, who came with Zheng Chenggong. The majority were merchants, officials, clerks, and other fugitives. Xu Dishan's "Biography of Mr. Kuiyuan" points out that immigrants can be divided into five types: (1) pirates, (2) fishermen, (3) human traffickers, (4) commoners evading heavy taxes, (5) prisoners of Japanese pirates. They are fiercely independent, prone to infighting, and their best qualities are their conservatism, strong resistance, willingness to endure hardship, and adventurous spirit. Historically, they drove out the Dutch, and during the Japanese rule, they were never peaceful, with minor disturbances every three years and major upheavals every ten years. Initially, the Japanese adopted a conquering attitude, but the result strengthened the anti-Japanese movement, such as the Beipu, Linjipu, Miaoli, Liujia, Dongshi movements, etc. The Wushe Incident in 1930, in which 134 of the 227 resident Japanese were killed, was a lesson for Japanese rule over the indigenous people.

We must acknowledge that the Taiwanese people are excellent, but officials from the mainland must not look down on Taiwanese people with an arrogant attitude or treat them with the methods used for colonies. This needs to be corrected because China must not lose these six million people!

Three Types of People:

Expressing Opposition to Reality

But Taiwanese people are not without shortcomings. The parochialism and shortsightedness of island people, impatience and lack of perseverance, and the common sluggishness and laziness of tropical people are often exposed. They attribute the high prices, insecure life, the inability to quickly improve public order, and even germs and corruption to mainlanders. They resent the government's failure to select Taiwanese as first-class cadres. At an important gathering, a person in charge, who occupied an important position, frankly pointed out that there are three types of people who oppose the current situation: (1) The "obedient gentlemen" of the Japanese era, who were deeply afraid of being severely punished by the government in the early days of the recovery, hid themselves. Later, seeing that the government was lenient, they came out again, hoping to regain their previous special status. When the government couldn't satisfy their desires, they became resentful. (2) Those who were pawns of the Japanese in the economy, who were previously allocated many public lands by the Japanese to sublet to tenant farmers and exploit them in between. Now, the land is being cleared, and the government is taking it back, eliminating the exploitation of intermediaries for the farmers. They also complain. (3) Taiwanese compatriots returning from various places, requesting to work in their original agencies. After the recovery, all kinds of "companies" were abolished, and they couldn't find jobs, so they also complained. These three types of people are in the opposition. Some elected senators were even pointed out to be "favorites" of the Japanese government in the past. But objectively speaking, there are really not many Taiwanese with political talent. Recently, the National Government stipulated that eight Taiwanese members of parliament be elected. How to select them? Who to elect? This poses a difficult problem for the Taiwanese people.

There are about 2,000 Japanese people conscripted in Taiwan. Some are indeed working peacefully, while others are "staying behind" here for other purposes. Cargo ships from Japan bring Japanese women, and the military police have arrested Japanese people secretly carrying out activities. Because Taiwanese people have developed feelings for the Japanese over the past 50 years, some secretly marry Japanese women, and some technicians eagerly seek to return to the embrace of Japan. This phenomenon is painful but realistic.

Becoming:

An Economic Group with the Whole Country

Taiwan is a province of China. Like other provinces, it is an administrative unit of China, with no difference or special characteristics. The only thing is that this Chinese land was forcibly occupied by the Japanese for 50 years and is now returned to its original owner. The government doesn't need to focus excessively on Taiwan, and Taiwan doesn't have the idea of being a surviving colony to be exploited to supply the country.

Governor Chen Yi adopted some of the Japanese methods in certain areas. The biggest features are the existence of the Monopoly Bureau and the controlled Trade Bureau. In reality, the monopoly products camphor, tobacco, alcohol, matches, weights, and measures, etc., don't hold much hope. The Japanese used opium, salt, and the above five items to account for more than 38/100 of total fiscal revenue. Currently, they account for more than 32/100 of total revenue, but the future is bleak. Regarding these two bureaus, Governor Chen Yi explained that this is a method of developing national capital according to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings and will also be a nursery for the implementation of the Three Principles of the People in Taiwan. The province's budget for this year is 2.4 billion, but the main source of income relies on the revenue of public enterprises, accounting for more than 80/100. However, each enterprise unit is currently in a state of great distress, lacking raw materials, lacking markets, and facing high electricity and labor costs. The destroyed infrastructure cannot be restored quickly, and the restored infrastructure cannot maintain a balance of income and expenditure. As a result, they have to find ways to increase taxes on land and real estate and issue banknotes.

This is Not:

A Ball on the East Pacific

Taiwan doesn't have hyperinflation, but rather chronic inflation, which cannot yet be considered malignant. Governor Chen said that the monopoly of goods, the control of sugar, and the maintenance of the Taiwan dollar are all transitional measures taken to preserve the province's vitality. People criticize his decisions without understanding them and deeply hate them. However, he is happy to accept suggestions for correction regarding the skills and integrity of technicians and staff. In reality, Taiwan's politics needs to truly align with the mainland, and economically, it needs to become an economic group with the whole of China in order to find a way out. Specialization is impossible and unworkable. Taiwanese people fear that the island of Taiwan will be a ball on the East Pacific, tossed around. The government has no way to continue to cultivate this new land, restore the people's hearts, but Taiwanese people need to be self-sufficient, need nutrition, need life, and more urgently need to courageously take on the responsibility of construction.

Taiwan is a province of China. It develops by inheriting the overall situation of the country. Building an agricultural and industrialized Taiwan and strengthening the national defense fortress of China's southeast gateway can find its future. In fact, it is not a cancer for China.

Ambassador Stuart Passes Through Hong Kong A Speaking Mouth Has Been Silenced!

Our Newspaper's Hong Kong Airmail Report from the 2nd, Special Correspondent Ling Fang

Sir Stevenson, the new British Ambassador to China, is a diplomat with liberal ideas. When he came to China to take office, passing through Singapore, the "Crossroads of Asia" via the Suez Canal, he made a statement to the press corps regarding the "Future of Hong Kong." When it reached Hong Kong, the Hong Kong government became seven-parts wary of him. Some responsible journalists in Hong Kong counted the days until the new ambassador's arrival and asked the Hong Kong Government Information Services to arrange an interview with the new ambassador. This alarmed the colonial officials who were trying to maintain Hong Kong's pre-war status at all costs. They discussed it again and again and finally decided that the new ambassador could not meet with journalists. The new ambassador's words, "Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has stated that the future of Hong Kong is a matter to be discussed in due course. This is also the attitude of the British government" — see Reuters Singapore dispatch on the 22nd — may be said elsewhere, but not here in Hong Kong.

Ambassador Stevenson arrived in Hong Kong on the British aircraft carrier HMS Unicorn at 10:30 AM on the 26th, having traveled from Singapore. Governor of Hong Kong Young Mau-chi sent General Fitzwilliams, Commander of the British Forces in Hong Kong, and T. Megarry, Secretary for Chinese Affairs, to the pier to welcome him. The new ambassador and his wife went ashore, reviewed the honor guard, and drove to Government House. Until they departed Hong Kong for Shanghai on the British warship HMS Constance, not a single journalist was seen. They accompanied the ambassador on tours of the island's scenery and arranged a rich entertainment program, occupying all of the new ambassador's time in Hong Kong. Regardless of whether the new ambassador was happy or not, the Hong Kong government's plan succeeded: the ambassador's speaking mouth was sealed airtight. Governor Young Mau-chi, originally scheduled to visit Guangzhou on the 28th, delayed it by one day because of the new ambassador.

### Mrs. Ma and Madam Chiang Stroll on Kuling Street Our Newspaper's Lushan Airmail Report from the 6th

— Special Correspondent Xie Baozhu

Mrs. Ma and Madam Chiang strolled on Kuling Street and were very interested to find that the stores on the street had a full range of goods. As a result, they saw a girl's children's clothing item displayed in a store, with a very beautiful style, and bought one to take back, delighted. However, both ladies strolled on the street without bringing any money with them, and temporarily ordered their attendants to return to the residence to get money to pay the bill.

The eldest daughter of President Soong came to the mountain, and Madam Chiang took great care of her. In addition to personally taking her for walks, she also accompanied her to buy a swimsuit and told her to go swimming. On the afternoon of the 5th, Madam and Mrs. Ma accompanied Miss Soong to visit the swimming pool and found that the facilities inside were very good, and checked the temperature gauge at 75 degrees, which they thought was very suitable. So, they went to the street together and spent 85,000 yuan to buy a beige wool swimsuit for Miss Soong, and bought a large straw hat to give her. In addition, Madam also bought three wool vests, each costing 35,000 yuan, two of which were given to Mr. and Mrs. Ma, and one was bought for the Chairman.

Miss Soong did not bring a straw hat when she came to the mountain, but the midday sun was scorching. Miss Soong, unable to refuse the loving kindness of her father and aunt, had to put on President Soong's straw hat. However, walking on the street, she was afraid of being gossiped about by passersby. Therefore, in crowded places, she took off her hat, and in less crowded places, she put it on again. Fortunately, Madam bought one and gave it to her, and Miss Soong was immediately relieved and delighted.

Miss Soong is not as particular about her clothes as her mother. Yesterday, she wore a light blue, large lapel silk shirt, poweris suit pants, with the ends of the pants rolled up above her knees, a leather belt around her waist, and black flat leather shoes, walking with a sway, quite like a "cowherd." Miss Soong especially likes to wear sunglasses, and I heard that she always wears them even inside the house. People thought she had an eye problem, but in fact, Miss Soong has bright eyes and white teeth, without any flaws.

Mr. and Mrs. Ma invited the Chairman and his wife, President Soong and his daughter to a banquet at their private residence last night. Mrs. Ma wore a water-red floral silk Chinese-style long cheongsam given to her by Madam Chiang. Chairman Chiang praised her for looking very beautiful in Chinese clothes as soon as he entered the door, and Mrs. Ma jumped for joy upon hearing this.

After President Soong went up the mountain, he spent most of his time at the Chairman's official residence discussing important matters with the Chairman. When you walk past Hedong Road, you can often see the Chairman and the President sitting and talking on the veranda. Therefore, the President didn't have much time to accompany his daughter on trips, so he left her with Madam and asked her to take care of her. Madam could also get an extra companion, and often took Miss Soong for walks or chats in the garden.

Luo Jialun has composed twelve poems in his week in Kuling. Those who ask Luo for poems are mostly students from summer camps and members of lecture courses. Luo is always responsive, completing them with a flourish, with magnificent spirit and rich scenery.

As soon as Minister Peng Xuepei arrived in Kuling and entered the Xianyan Hotel, he was surrounded by reporters and held an impromptu press conference, answering reporters' questions about the attack on American troops on the Pingjin Railway.

Mr. Peng loves riding horses and swimming. One day after arriving in Kuling, he went to the swimming pool in high spirits, wanting to show off his skills, but when he touched the water with his hand, he repeatedly said, "The water is too cold!" and had to return disappointed.

Mr. and Mrs. Ma are not very satisfied with the large oil painting in front of the residence. Mr. Ma said: "I don't seem that serious!"

There are many antique buyers coming to Kuling these days, all speaking a few sentences of pidgin English, with the Westerners on the mountain as their biggest customers. When Admiral Kirk came to Kuling this time, there were people who came to his door to peddle them. Mr. Kirk bought some of them, but Mrs. Kirk said: "The price is really expensive." An antique dealer wearing a long black gown always explained to new customers: "We are passing by, because we don't have the money for the boat back home, so we have to sell these antiques." But if you buy something from him today, he will come again tomorrow, bringing a large batch of inventory for you to choose from, and I don't know where those things come from.

Madam Chiang's personal secretary, Ms. Chen Chunlian, brought her one-year-old baby to live at No. 15 Zhihong Road this time. Ms. Chen goes to Madam's office for one or two hours around 10:00 every morning and then goes home for lunch. If Madam calls in the afternoon, she goes to the official residence. Otherwise, she always stays at home to take care of her child.

After the Lizi Society came to the mountain to work, they took over the Kuling tennis court, swimming pool, etc. In the past, these places were managed by the Lushan Administration Bureau. Now that their business has been taken away, everyone is very unhappy.

The weather in Lushan has been getting hotter recently, and coffee tea rooms and sports venues are booming, especially the swimming pool, which is frequented by many people. Swimming tickets cost 1,000 yuan each, but in reality, very few people actually buy tickets. Most are members of the Lizi Society or have special relationships.

### Replies to Readers Medical and Health

(1) Wang Cheng asks: I am 48 years old and suddenly developed a frequent hiccuping condition six or seven years ago. At first, I didn't think it was strange, but now the hiccuping sound is getting louder, like a cow's moo. I often feel nauseous, my abdomen is bloated, and I don't feel hungry even when I don't eat. When I wake up in the morning, my abdomen is harder than usual, my stomach lining is abnormally thin, and my lower back hurts severely. Looking at the course of the disease, it seems to be getting worse. I am a salaried worker and cannot afford to see a doctor. I sincerely ask you to give me a simple and effective prescription. I would be extremely grateful.

[Answer from Dr. Yu Xin'en, MD]: Hiccups may be caused by swallowing foods that are too hot or irritating, or by gastritis and stomach distension. They can also be caused by chronic alcohol poisoning. It is necessary to first find the cause of the disease. In addition to the common methods for stopping hiccups, you can also try placing an ice pack on your neck or pressing your eyeballs with your fingers. If all of these are ineffective and the hiccups persist repeatedly, then you can only cut the phrenic nerve to stop them.

(2) Hu Shi asks: On August 9th of last year, after dinner, I visited a friend at his residence. Shortly after sitting down, I felt dizzy and lost consciousness. My mouth and lips were crooked, and I fell to the ground. My friend sent me back home, and I have been receiving medical treatment ever since. However, after ten months, I still cannot return to normal. My right foot has no sensation when it touches the ground, and I cannot lift my right hand. Chinese and Western medicine have both been ineffective. How unfortunate! What is this disease? Are there any doctors who can treat this disease? I respectfully ask for a detailed answer.

[Answer from Dr. Yu Xin'en, MD]: The disease is called stroke and hemiplegia. You should rest more and improvement will be slower. You should not be anxious.

(3) Lu Wenbu asks: I am a worker and am experiencing economic hardship due to rising prices. I cannot afford to see a doctor. I humbly ask that you answer my question in your newspaper. I would be very grateful. My child is only 17 months old and developed symptoms similar to a nerve condition or a fright in mid-September of last year. When frightened, his face loses color (for about two minutes) and then he sleeps less. So far, he has been frightened once every few days. Is this epilepsy or pig epilepsy? Is it dangerous? What are the economical treatments?

[Answer from Dr. Yu Xin'en, MD]: The disease is called epilepsy. You can use a brain sedative, as prescribed by a doctor.

### Seeking Location of Land

Editor: Before the war, someone used a job title for a piece of land in the Sixteenth District of the Fourth District of the Twenty-first District of Shanghai County, Songjiang Prefecture in the fifth year of Xianfeng to mortgage a loan to my father. During the Anti-Japanese War, my father passed away and it was never known where the land was located. I asked the Shanghai Municipal Land Administration Bureau and the offices on Daxi Road and Shangwen Road, but they didn't know either. Please give me a corner of your newspaper to publicly inquire, so that those who know can provide guidance. I respectfully submit this from Liu Feng, 144 Doushi Street, Annam City.

### Severe Disasters in Jiangsu and Hunan Xu Nianchu Generously Donates Large Sums Saving Fellow Sufferers Through Austerity: Seeking My Heart's Peace

To Whom It May Concern: Our country's eight years of resistance have caused the people to experience suffering, with some families broken and destroyed and some displaced. Fortunately, the darkness has passed, freeing us from our suffering. But unexpectedly, the conflict between the Communists and Nationalists has reignited, placing our people in dire straits. Alas! Recently, Jiangsu and Hunan have either suffered repeated artillery fire or are filled with the bodies of the starved. People either die from weapons or in ditches, becoming refugees with only a breath of life left! I am unworthy but, relying on the blessings of my ancestors, I can still have enough to eat. Every time I think of my fellow sufferers, I am filled with sorrow! I dare to donate my savings, trying to do my best to help. I am only seeking my heart's peace and doing what I can. Herewith is a bank draft for two million legal tender (see donation report in this column on August 7). I respectfully hope that you will accept it and forward it to the disaster victims in Jiangsu and Hunan, half each. I am extremely grateful. Respectfully submitted to the Social Services Section of the Shen Bao.

### Advocating Educational Savings

Mr. Reporter: I remember that before the war, banks had a type of educational savings scheme. Indeed, this was a good method because the majority of families belong to the impoverished class. Therefore, parents could save up a sum of money, deposit it in the bank, and enable their children to cover tuition fees, book expenses, etc., from primary school to middle school, and even university, each semester without having to find additional ways to make ends meet. When the time came, they could simply withdraw the money from the bank and hand it over to the school to enable their children to study. Such an excellent method was not only affected by the war, but was actually discontinued, which is truly regrettable. After the victory, banks in Shanghai are booming in business but show no intention of planning for the welfare of the people. They are focused on high-interest loans and exploiting the common people. To put it bluntly, this type of bank accounts for 100% of them. According to news gleaned from the end-of-June settlement surplus figures, small banks and money shops have surpluses of tens of millions of yuan, and larger banks and money shops undoubtedly have even more. Although there are many reasons for the low level of education in China, I believe that educational savings are a truly good method to help promote education. I urge the national banks and commercial banks to work hard to promote and restore educational savings! (Wang Xueqian)

### How to Eradicate the Poisonous Influence in Xintai

Mr. Editor: During the eight years of the War of Resistance, the occupied areas covered almost more than ten provinces and regions. Wherever the Japanese set foot, wherever their cruel flames reached, poisonous influences followed. Xintai, located at the intersection of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, made it easy for criminals to hide. Therefore, criminal cases occurred repeatedly, and the authorities turned a blind eye. Since the Japanese implemented a policy of poisoning the population, those addicted to opium have largely considered smoking white powder more cost-effective. Little did they know that it would become a trend, and the number of drug offenders increased daily. During the War of Resistance, the government's power may not have reached everywhere, leading to the cultivation of a boil, causing endless harm. As a result, people with status indulge in it as a matter of course, without any sense of shame, leading to the spread of this behavior from top to bottom, and the rampant spread of drug abuse. Drug trafficking organizations are located in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang regions, and the scale of sales is shocking. The police stations refuse to deal with it because they cannot profit from it, and the courts release offenders after only one night due to a concern for prison rations. When will the wise government begin to punish these people with the ultimate penalty, so that society can move towards peace and tranquility? (Gao Jie)

### Passenger Safety Should Be Sought

Mr. Editor: The French-owned Red Route 22 public buses always start moving with the door unopened once the ticket conductor has rung the bell, so that a couple of passengers must climb onto the moving bus, the danger of which is easy to imagine. The safety of children and women is especially a concern. When questioned, the conductors respond that "there is no time." It may be that they can complete their journeys earlier and finish work and rest, or that the company limits the journey time. The former reason is perhaps more valid, so stopping times at the stations, especially in the evenings are especially short. When boarding and alighting, the ticket conductors rush people, pressing them like wildfire. I seem to have read similar news in a certain newspaper before, but it did not attract the attention of the authorities, so this situation continues to exist. Now, for the sake of public safety, I am using the medium of your newspaper to make this public. Please City Public Utility Bureau pay attention to it. This concerns human life, so do not delay!

### Paradise of the Vagrant

— Cang Shi

Suppose you are bumped into on the tram or on the street, and the legal tender and valuables on your person leave your pocket. Perhaps you go to a store to buy something, and before you have paid, the items have already vanished. Sometimes you and your wife or lover are strolling down the street, and someone blocks your path and kneels on the ground asking for money. Do you feel a headache?

You must feel very angry in your mind, suspecting that the public security organs are not working hard enough. But we must know! These thousands upon thousands of vagrants are not born that way! Here are ironclad facts before us, that a month ago, it was these people who caused you headaches and anger! Today, they make you feel like shedding tears of sympathy. They all stand tall, living a very disciplined collective life, and demonstrate very good self-governance. This relief home is divided into three parts: the adult group, the youth camp, and the children's camp. They receive education and work. The members of the adult group are already able to serve society. Before, they were people rejected by society, but now they have become sound members of society.

At this general review, Mayor Wu was very moved when he saw those who were marching in formation, advancing bravely on the road to self-renewal: "This is the happiest day I've had in Shanghai!" In the whole of China, there are countless millions of such unfortunate people. Why can't we let them also step into this paradise and be cultivated into useful people in society?

I want to appeal to society, to petition philanthropists, to hold fewer temple fairs, to perform fewer Taoist rituals for peace, to live a little less luxurious and selfish lives, and to contribute enthusiastically so that this relief home can be strengthened.

Of course, the fundamental plan is to hope that the government authorities and people from all walks of life will pay attention together and reduce the number of people in society who need relief. At the same time, as a temporary measure, we believe that more relief homes with strict management and highly effective operations should be established, because every vagrant wandering on the streets is, in any case, our own brother, our own compatriot!

### Inheritance (Fiction)

— You Chizhao

That was sixteen years ago:

"It's time to go home, what will become of me if I stay here!" Old Hu pondered.

Old Hu was sixty years old this year. He had left home twenty years ago and had hardly returned. He started as a clerk in the × Bureau, and worked for nineteen years, still doing that job, but his monthly salary had increased from fifteen yuan to forty yuan. Besides supporting himself and subsidizing his family, he also earned himself hemorrhoids that had plagued him for many years. Last year, the × Bureau transferred the director, and Old Hu's hemorrhoids happened to flare up. He took a leave of absence for more than a week, but as a result, he lost his position with a monthly salary of forty yuan. The reason was that Old Hu was old and had many illnesses, and should retire. Moreover, he had worked in the bureau for so many years, which was enough! Fortunately, out of pity for his age, they gave him a year's severance pay, which was considered a great grace in the bureau. Old Hu stayed in S City for five months with that severance pay, trying to work hard again, but no one wanted his scrap anymore. Although his work was still skilled and quick, even better than the young people. "I'm old!" Old Hu also felt it was true. An old cow! It would be slaughtered even after being pulled to its limit as repayment. So he felt that it was better to be a person than a cow!

"It's time to go home, what will become of me if I stay here?" He thought again.

Speaking of home, Old Hu remembered his old ancestral house in C City and his three sons and two daughters. He also remembered his deceased old partner. His wife had completed the major events of his children's marriage during the twenty years he was away from home. His wife's second half of her life was also spent washing diapers for the children and serving the third generation, until she took her last breath, which was only three years ago.

Hearing from people from C City: he learned how his daughters-in-law treated his wife, and the circumstances before and after his wife's death. Because of this, he had not sent money or letters home. His children also had not sent news. He was estranged from his family. Thinking of home, he had become a stranger. But now that he had been dismissed from the bureau, and no one wanted him even if he tried to work hard again, it had been five months. What would he do if this continued? Even if he died, he had to be buried with his old partner! This was what made him think of home, but thinking of this—the story of three monks having no water to drink—he was worried. After thinking hard for a while, Old Hu suddenly laughed again. In the end, he decided to go home, to return to his old ancestral house in C City. He heard that his old ancestral house was still inhabited by his three daughters-in-law.

He went and bought two brand new leather suitcases, which were heavy with his few old belongings, and set off by boat back to C City.

"Ah, isn't it true! The ancients also said: 'Returning with a full load' 'To strengthen the journey'," Old Hu thought. He smiled on the surface, but was worried subconsciously.

On Sunday morning, the ship docked at C City. Old Hu thought that old people should take sedan chairs to go home. He also hired porters to carry the luggage. Leaving C City after twenty years, he felt that although it was as old as he was, the model was still the same, and the roads were always familiar. The sedan chair was moving, also arousing a lot of Old Hu's nostalgic emotions.

Home! Only the eldest son and the second son clearly recognized him. The third son also called out to him along with his two brothers. They said:

"Father, you're back!" They were watching his whole body, watching his luggage, especially the two brand new leather suitcases. Old Hu's clothes were not bad either, a gray homespun silk robe, tied trouser legs, wearing new thin-soled shoes.

The porters carrying the luggage, although it was autumn, still had sweat on their foreheads, complaining that the luggage was heavy and they wanted more money.

"The luggage is indeed heavy," Old Hu smiled on his face, "This is my blood and sweat of twenty years, that has accumulated into this little bit, two boxes of it, I was afraid that the old ones could not bear the weight and would break, so I bought two new ones—good, right, must give you a few more coins," Old Hu said, lifting up his long gown and taking out his wallet, full of "silver dollars," snow-white, shining in the eyes of his grandchildren.

"Father, let me pay them," the eldest son hurried to send away the sedan chair carriers, porters.

"Father, you must be tired from the journey, you should rest and sit down," the second son hurried to help.

"Why don't you pour tea for Father, pass him a cigarette!" The third son ordered his daughters-in-law.

"Ah!" Old Hu sighed with comfort, sat on the old rosewood chair, asked about the past, talked about family matters, counted his grandsons.

"Grandpa, Grandpa..." The three daughters-in-law led their children to greet Old Hu. He smiled, took out silver coins, and distributed them to his grandchildren to "buy candy to eat," as a greeting gift.

"Why don't you thank Grandpa quickly!" The daughters-in-law taught their children again. The little mouths laughed and made a fuss, not afraid of strangers, surrounding Old Hu's knees, some even tugging at his clothes, wanting to pull on his wallet, only quieting down when their parents scolded them.

"You clean up that room upstairs and let Father live there, and put the luggage in my place." Old Hu began to instruct his sons, "You have to be frugal to accumulate money, I didn't buy anything for you this time, but save as much as you can. It's by my frugality that I accumulated these two boxes, all for you."

In the evening, Old Hu locked himself in his room, counting the silver coins, which rang for so long that the daughters-in-law could hear it clearly. Everyone felt comfortable.

The next day, the two daughters got the news, and also came with their sons-in-law to meet and greet him.

They talked about Old Hu counting "silver dollars" last night, fearing that Old Hu was too tired, but Old Hu said: "Old people are just not at ease in everything, and they have to check everything themselves. You think, the boxes were put on the boat for so many days, I was afraid that someone would steal some, how can I be at ease if I don't count them."

They also said that hiding the silver was not promising, it was better to deposit it in the money shop, lend it to others, do business. Old Hu said: "You young people don't understand things, people's hearts are not as old as they used to be, the money shop will also close down, and doing business will also lose money, it's better for me to keep it safely, after all, when I breathe my last, it will be yours, and then you can do whatever you want."

Old Hu's three sons all had jobs, and lived together but ate separately. They discussed taking turns supporting their father for a month each. Sometimes Old Hu went to his son-in-law's house and stayed for a few days, sometimes he distributed small silver coins to the children, and used them as his own pocket money. Sometimes he counted them repeatedly, always ringing until midnight.

During Qingming Festival, he also went to his wife's grave, and when he came back, he said to his sons:

"You handle things thoughtfully, but I have always advocated saving, your mother's tombstone is too big, it is best to shorten it by five inches, leaving only five inches to save money, and the soil does not need to be piled so high:" As he said this, his eyes turned red, and his sons thought he was missing his mother, and persuaded him.

Old Hu just lived like this, supported by his sons. The neighbors all said that he was more blessed than his old partner.

In the late spring of Old Hu's sixty-fourth year, his hemorrhoids flared up again, more severe than in previous years, prolapsed. He could not sit or lie down in peace. He himself felt that his appetite was getting worse day by day, and he could not swallow much when he looked at things.

"Hmm, it's over, this, there's not much left, I should go!" Old Hu lay in bed, playing with a dozen "silver dollars" with his withered hands, thinking to himself.

In April. On the day he breathed his last, he called his children to his bedside. He was still conscious. He said:

"You have finally raised Dad like a human being for a few years, but, you were also educated by Dad and Mom." Speaking of this, he couldn't help but shed tears, "Let your eldest brother be in charge of distributing what I leave behind..." As if feeling ashamed, or lacking strength, he paused for a while. "But, we are also a big family, your grandfather, your great-grandfather were also officials, but when it came to Dad, the times changed, and I became a useless person, you have forgotten Dad." He began to gasp. "You should also not be like a small family, dividing it up as soon as Dad closes his eyes, at least, do my funeral properly first, and also be buried with your mother." Speaking of this, his eyes moistened again, "Eldest son, give the keys to the boxes to you, you must follow Dad's words, do you understand!" After saying this, he turned his face inside and slept, and the children's eyes also turned red.

Old Hu gradually spoke unclearly, and breathed his last by evening, but his eyes seemed to not be able to close.

The whole family mourned, and the innocent little grandson choked and wanted his grandpa. The children were discussing his funeral. Originally, everyone wanted to take out some money to raise enough to handle things for him. But the eldest brother insisted:

"I'll take care of it first, Dad also entrusted me with it. I propose to divide what he left behind, except for the ancestral house, into five parts, we three brothers each take one part, the two sisters each take half a part, and the remaining half part will be given to my eldest son, because he is the嫡孫, and the remaining half part will be considered Dad and Mom's "sacrificial fees"."

Everyone temporarily felt that there was no objection to this method, but everyone said: "Dad worked hard to save so many things for us, we must also make him glorious after death, and bury him and Mom together, and erect a large stone stele."

Old Hu's funeral: the funeral procession, burial, opening sacrifice, "doing the seventh," "lighting the main candle" and "ascending the platform" were all done. The neighbors and relatives all said that he was more blessed than his old partner.

That day, Old Hu's children came to distribute what he had left behind. When they lifted the two heavy leather suitcases, happiness overflowed their brows, and their hearts were like they were jumping. The siblings blamed the eldest brother for taking too much advantage.

The eldest brother took out the keys and opened the two suitcases first, the faces of everyone changed from bright to fiery, and the wide eyes gradually shrank.

In the two suitcases, what was covered on top were Old Hu's old clothes, and what was underneath, what was underneath were those bricks, tiles, and stones.

### Camille Corot (Selection of World Famous Paintings)

— By Thomas Lawrence (1769-1830)

Displayed at the Victoria Museum in London

At the age of ten, Lawrence began his artistic career, painting portraits in chalk. In 1787, he entered the Royal Academy. From then on, he became the center of fashion. He painted portraits of the most beautiful and talented women of the time. His painting fees were extremely high, and he spent money like water.

In 1815, he painted "The Victors of Waterloo" for the Windsor Gallery, and he also painted many portraits while traveling to major European cities. He received great honor in both social and artistic circles, and was hailed as a great English painter.

However, after his death, there was a major reaction, and he fell from overpraise during his lifetime to the sad state of devaluation.

The fact is that Lawrence did paint some immortal works. Some are in private collections, and some are displayed in galleries. These portraits of women have noble and poetic qualities. Although his coloring is sometimes inevitably monotonous, and sometimes lacks nature and simplicity, it is still a masterpiece. —Cheng Lu attached a note

### Since Justice…

— By Victor Hugo Translated by Li Jianwu

Napoleon's descendants deceived France, overthrew the Second Republic, declared a restoration, and restored the Empire. The great poet Victor Hugo was exiled abroad from 1852 for a full eighteen years, until Prussia marched into Paris, the Empire collapsed, and the Republic was rebuilt, before returning to his motherland. —Translator

Li Jianwu appended a note. August 5. Since justice is in the abyss, since the jade tablet has been given to evil, since all rights have been sold out, since even the proudest have a bitter face, since the corner of the boundary stone is plastered with the shame of my motherland; O Republic created by ancestors, Lingyan Pavilion full of bright light, golden dome in the free firmament, temple of immortal souls, since people have moved a ladder to paste the empire on your wall; Since spirituality has all died out, since crawling, since forgetting truth, purity, greatness, beauty, eyes angry for history, reputation, law, right, glory, and the martyrs in the wall tomb; I love you, exile! Pain! I love you! Sorrow, take it as my crown! I love you, proud poverty! I love my door with the wind hitting it. I love sorrow, serious statues to sit beside me. I love that disaster that tests me, I find the shadows of you, O for you my heart rejoices, dignity, faith, obscured morality, you, freedom, proud exile, and you, loyalty, great fugitive! I love this lonely island! Jersey, free England covers it with old pavilions, ever-rising black water, ships, wandering plows, waves, mysterious field roads. I love your cranes, O deep sea flapping brown wings, shaking the water waves above into pearls, throwing them into the surging 彼刃, and then coming out of the open throat, as if a soul walking out of pain. I love the solemn absoluteness, I hear the groans of eternity, incessant like a guilt, forever reborn in the shadows, waves brushing against the gloomy reefs, mothers embracing their dead children.

### Year of Victory

— Shao Fu

This day last year was a day of jubilation. In Chongqing, people were like crazy, shouting and screaming, everywhere were firecrackers, wine bottles and extra editions. I remember going to a restaurant for a small drink, because Comrade Zhao Dan had returned from prison in Xinjiang, and we were giving him a welcome dinner. After leaving the restaurant, a surge of anger swept the streets. The US News Agency's mimeographed small extra edition announced that Japan had formally surrendered. People were distributing them everywhere. I hurried back to the newspaper, while Comrade Zhao Dan, on his way home, was said to have been injured on his buttocks by wine bottles thrown randomly on the street. The outburst of emotion, the accumulated pain of eight years, all got a vent. There were tears in the laughter. It was really hard to describe the flavor.

It was not just Chongqing, but people all over China experienced that kind of psychological state—laughing with tears, and a bit of bewildered blankness.

A year ago today, how did we think about the days ahead? I dare not say that it was a beautiful dream. Those who could truly understand reality could not have harbored extravagant hopes. However, we always believed that the days ahead would at least be much looser than the past eight years. We always had this minimum belief, but after these three hundred and sixty-five days, even that was shattered. To be honest, the pain we all feel today is still greater than it was a year ago.

We are not afraid of inflation, we are not afraid of high prices, we are not afraid of stagnant production. What we are afraid of is that the grand plan of national construction cannot be carried out, that there is indefinite procrastination, a state of being neither dead nor alive, that corruption runs rampant, that social customs are deteriorating, and that everyone has reached a stage of losing faith. Such a victory, the victory that brought these things, is not what we could have imagined, and even more so, not what we can accept.

It has been a year since the victory. Reviewing this messy account, today we should still be wiping away tears, and the tears we shed are probably not of joy but of anger.

### The Fate of a Badge

— Yang Mou

Although I have this round badge with a beautiful flower on it, I am afraid to wear it.

Although when entering or leaving the office, the guards scrutinize you for your badge, I would rather slightly expose my lapel when I am almost in front of them. I don't want to always display it prominently. Although some people proudly stick out their chests and wear their badges high, looking both spirited and proud, I can only secretly admire them. I dare not. Why? Maybe I am not worthy, perhaps I fear I will bring misfortune or shame to the badge; or maybe I fear the badge will bring these things to me.

Wearing a badge on the tram, even though I have bought a ticket, it always seems like I am suspected of freeloading. Sometimes, the ticket seller or inspector is especially polite and simply doesn't ask you for a ticket. Other times, when they do ask for your ticket, it seems like they are more cautious than they are with other passengers. They might be preparing to embarrass you, but you have nothing to say.

Once, I was riding a bicycle when the front wheel of a bicycle next to me got caught in my back wheel while avoiding a car. As a result, several spokes of his front wheel broke. That person was unreasonable. Even though it was his own fault, he insisted that I compensate him. I argued with him, but he stubbornly insisted. As more and more onlookers gathered, he even made a big deal about my badge, as if I was bullying him because of my position. Two people nearby even said, "Now it's a democracy, you can't rely on your official status anymore." It was truly laughable and upsetting. In order to avoid trouble, and because I was wearing that badge, I had to unfairly compensate him.

Luckily, I don't go to dance halls, but for friends who do, the badge is a major obstacle. Aren't civil servants repeatedly prohibited from going to such places? Of course, you can still go if you want, but be sure to hide that badge well. Otherwise, regardless of right or wrong, you might become an unfortunate scapegoat.

Friend gatherings and public places are also best avoided when wearing a badge. Wearing a badge is like representing a sense of poverty. Seeing someone wearing a badge at a social gathering always leads people to associate it with words like "seeking personal gain," "making requests," and "showing favoritism." Aren't there also laws restricting banquets and gatherings for civil servants?

I like my work, and I like my badge. But I keep my affection hidden in my heart, and I keep my badge hidden in my lapel.

I don't want to go to dance halls or attend social gatherings, but I also don't want to be subjected to any more discrimination, even a little bit, against my self-respect and anger.

I don't know if I am letting the badge down, or if the badge is letting me down, but I carefully keep it hidden.

### Character Analysis

— Jun Yi

"官" (Official): The head wears a gauze hat, full of official airs. But below are two mouths. One is used when taking office to swear, "If I am found to be corrupt, I will accept severe punishment." The other is used for seeking personal gain and negotiating prices when engaging in malfeasance, so it is larger than the upper mouth. The two mouths are connected together to form the character "官."

"中" (Center): A square circle, with one stroke in the middle. If it leans left, the right side looks bad; if it leans right, the left side looks unattractive. It is still the way of the middle, remaining straight down the center. This is what is meant by "impartiality is called the center."

"國" (Nation): Many people, little land. Warfare is rampant in the Northeast. The outer line has a gap in the northwest corner. It must be improved.

"漢" (Han): From above, it looks a bit like a revolutionary. But below it is a "hoary old thief with white hair." Once fallen into the water, he naturally becomes a hero of the Han traitor category.

"奸" (Traitor): All those who do the work of a traitor cannot escape having to do with "dry women". It's a pity that the skirt is not long enough. If it were a little longer, and hooked from below, it would be a good character. A Han traitor becomes a Han good man, then does a somersault, and with a shake of his body, wouldn't he be another "good fellow"?

"接" (Receive): When interacting with a concubine, one always avoids the face of the first wife, secretly and discreetly, not very upright and aboveboard.

"收" (Receive): Receiving "talents of shells," failure is imminent.

Recently, the weather has been exceptionally hot, so I thought of the song that Wu Yong, Bai Sheng, and others sang when robbing Liang Zhongshu's birthday gifts in the Water Margin:

"The red heart burns like fire,
The crops in the fields are half-withered,
The farmers' hearts are like boiling water,
The sons of nobles wave their fans."

Reflecting the social situation at that time; and now, the lives of the people of Subei in my hometown can be described as:

"The red sun scorches like fire,
Civil strife and war scorch the home;
The hearts of the people are like boiling water,
Allied nations shake their heads!"

### Sick People Cannot Get Medical Treatment, How Can They Afford Taoist Rituals for Ghosts?

— Xin Yun

It is almost time for the annual Taoist rituals again. In the alley where I live, fundraising has already begun since yesterday. According to the organizers, this year's rituals are scheduled to begin on the first day of the seventh lunar month. They estimate that the expenses on that day will be over a million yuan, so they hope for generous donations. They also claim that this ritual will surely drive away the epidemic ghosts from the alley.

Hearing these words, I couldn't help but laugh. If Taoist rituals could really drive away epidemic ghosts, what would be the use of epidemic hospitals? Why not simply have a large-scale ritual performed throughout Shanghai, driving all the epidemic ghosts completely out of the country? Wouldn't that save the authorities a sum of epidemic prevention expenses, and also allow the angels who go out every day to administer vaccinations to have some free time, killing two birds with one stone? Why not do it?

But in today's age of scientific advancement, everyone can prove that Taoist rituals are useless. So here, with twelve thousand points of sincerity, I implore all the enlightened people of Shanghai, never to believe in Taoist rituals, and to donate all this money for rituals to epidemic or refugee relief. Think about it: one alley needs to spend millions of yuan on rituals, so how many hundreds or thousands of alleys are there in Shanghai? Isn't this total amount astonishing? Putting it on epidemic or refugee donations, how many people can be saved?

Enlightened people of Shanghai! Think about it, which is right?

### My Observation of Cattle Slaughter at the World's Third Largest Slaughterhouse

— Chen Gange

Herds of cattle from all directions, driven by whips, walked across the bridge and stopped by the riverbank. Someone on the boat casually asked the cattle drivers:

"Do you need fodder?"

But this was obviously redundant, because the cattle had now become mere commodities. Before selling the commodities, the owners would never increase the cost of their commodities.

Beside the river was a deformed building, not very tall, but with a considerable area. Day and night, tidal waves of people, cattle, horses, and pigs squeezed through the narrow door. And people and carts carrying various fresh meats squeezed out. The nearby alleyways thus seemed even more bustling. ...

This is the famous world's third largest slaughterhouse - the Shajing Road Slaughterhouse, the place where the death sentences of cattle, horses, pigs, and sheep are carried out, which is also a major source of fresh meat supply in this city.

Tearful cattle, seemingly sensing their fate, shed tears at the gate. This is the end of their life of hard work: slaughter them! Although they shed tears, begging for their last chance to live, it is useless. Using tears to beg will never get the sympathy of mankind! Under the circumstances of being pulled and dragged, they still present their last gift in the same way – that is, their own bodies!

"This is the cattle detention center," the guide said to me.

I covered my mouth and nose with a large towel and inspected it deeply. Very clean, rows of cattle were quietly waiting here, with a pile of fodder placed beside them.

"Are these calves also going to be slaughtered?" When I discovered a pair of adorable calves, I asked curiously.

"Of course, milk is expensive. People need beef and milk, so they can't worry about them. Fortunately, slaughtering the calves not only provides tender beef to eat, but also leaves behind a portion of delicious fresh milk to squeeze for people to drink every day..." He was about to continue, but I shook my hand, and then stroked the back of the calf, which was so cute.

The calf raised its head, gazing deeply at us, wanting to move, but obviously being a newborn calf, it couldn't move yet.

"They're starting over there, would you like to go?" he urged, so I had to lift my feet and move forward!

Death machine pulled, a cow flipped down, and struggled to get up again below.

"Not dead?" I asked in surprise.

"It's too early yet, there's no electric current, so we can only use a hammer to kill them before slaughtering, look!"

I saw a man raising a large hammer with a handle as long as a cow, hammering down with force. I quickly turned away, unable to bear to watch. When I asked again, several people were already dismembering the cow with the most skillful techniques. I couldn't help but take a deep breath.

I asked to leave. But the guide said:

"You are really timid, the butchers kill more than three hundred heads every day!"

More than three hundred heads! A big number, I paused for a moment.

Because it was morning, many places were empty, and the butchers were idly chatting. I asked them: "What is the biggest cow you have ever killed?"

"The biggest?" they said happily: "One fathom long, more than a thousand pounds, it was a Singaporean breed."

"How are the cattle sourced, can you tell me?"

"Most of them come from the Jiangbei ports, in the Xuzhou and Haizhou area."

"Do you eat beef?"

Laughing, they all laughed and said: "Of course we love to eat it." Then they asked me back: "What? Does sir not like to eat it?"

I frowned and said to them, "I'm afraid I won't be able to eat anything today."

They laughed again.

Walking to the gate, someone was negotiating the price of selling cattle. I went up and asked, "Isn't this a draft animal?"

"It is a draft animal, sir."

"Draft animal? Sold, not plowing anymore?"

"Hey! There's no peace yet, the fields are hard to plow, so I simply sold it to have more food to eat and more money to pay the grain tax; actually, sir, who would be willing to sell it?" Slaughtering cattle, selling cattle," infinite feelings!
