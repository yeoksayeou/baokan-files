### Marshal Ma Left Kuling for Nanjing Yesterday; Will Invite Zhou Enlai to Lushan for Talks; U.S. Ambassador Resting Under Doctor's Orders

[Special Dispatch from Kuling, This Paper, 30th] Special Envoy Marshal left Kuling for Xun in the rain at 2:50 PM on the 30th, and returned to Nanjing by plane. At 12:30 PM on the 30th, Marshal Ma and his wife went to the Chairman's Office to say goodbye. The Chairman invited them to lunch. After the meal, Marshal Ma also went to the U.S. Embassy to visit Ambassador Stuart, who was resting. They talked for about a quarter of an hour before he left. Staff Officer Pi Zonggan accompanied Marshal Ma on the flight back to Nanjing. It is said that he may come to Kuling again this Friday.

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, This Paper, 30th] Special Envoy Marshal left Kuling on the afternoon of the 30th and returned to Nanjing. When he arrived at Dajiaochang Airport, it was already 7:05 PM, and he returned to the residence at 7:30 PM. Only three of his entourage, including his adjutant, arrived in Nanjing with him. Although Marshal Ma arrived in Nanjing very late, all parties have been paying close attention to his meeting with the Communist Party representatives. It is rumored that after returning to Nanjing, Marshal Ma will invite Communist Party representative Zhou Enlai to Lushan and first convey the results of his talks with Chairman Chiang over the past few days as a basis for continued talks. However, as of 11:00 PM, Zhou Enlai had not yet received an appointment from Marshal Ma, so a formal meeting may be scheduled for 10:00 AM tomorrow morning.

[Special Dispatch from Kuling, This Paper, 30th] According to an authoritative source who told this newspaper's reporter, the recent reports in the newspapers of Nanjing and Shanghai that the Military Three-Person Conference will be held in Nanjing or Kuling is purely speculation. The main task of the Military Three-Person Conference is to study how to implement the troop reorganization plan, and at present, the Communist Party has not shown the sincerity it should have in this regard. The so-called conference will be held soon is too premature.

[Special Dispatch from Kuling, This Paper, 30th] Ambassador Stuart had another high fever of 39 degrees last night. He also had a slight sweat last night, but he improved this morning, and his temperature dropped to 37 degrees in the afternoon. At 1:30 PM, Marshal Ma, accompanied by U.S. Army medical officer Dr. Habis, who had just arrived in Kuling from Nanjing, and Dr. Buck of the U.S. Embassy, ​​examined Ambassador Stuart. The blood test results showed that the condition was not serious. The ambassador is now resting under doctor's orders, eating less food. Today, he only had a small amount of orange juice and liquid drinks, and did not eat anything else.

[Central News Agency, Kuling, 30th] Chairman Chiang is very concerned about Ambassador Stuart's health. In addition to sending his own medical officer to diagnose and treat him, and sending staff to visit him, he also presented several bottles of orange juice today. In addition, Marshal Marshall, before leaving Kuling, telegraphed two famous American doctors in Nanjing, who arrived in Kuling on the 30th to treat the ambassador. Their diagnosis results were completely consistent with the diagnosis report of the National Government's medical officer, and found that the ambassador had no symptoms, only indigestion. After all, the ambassador, at the age of 73, traveled between Nanjing and Kuling, where the temperature difference is 20 degrees, which is enough to affect his digestion. Ambassador Stuart is still resting at his residence under doctor's orders today.

### Zhou Enlai's Speech; Believes the Situation is Extremely Serious

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 30th] Zhou Enlai made his first public speech today after talking with Ambassador Stuart, saying that the overall situation in China is extremely serious. When asked about the conflict near Beiping, he claimed that he had not heard of it before meeting the journalists, nor had he seen it reported in the newspapers. Regarding the incident of the seven U.S. soldiers being captured, he said that the Communist troops only disarmed them, treated them quite well, and eventually returned the weapons together. The CCP hopes that Americans will take a friendly attitude towards the Communist troops and that such incidents will not happen again. The general reaction of the government today is that the Communist troops' attack on the U.S. military is an extension of the movement in Yan'an to incite American public opinion and expel the U.S. military. The Communist side believes that a conflict with the U.S. military, even if the Communist troops openly violate it, can produce the desired effect. Zhou Enlai spoke about the current military and political situation, and again demanded an immediate and comprehensive ceasefire, followed by the restoration of transportation and an agreement on supplementary conditions for the troop reorganization plan. It is said that Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart both want to maintain peace in China. Zhou said at the end that he had no plans to go to Lushan.

The outline of his statement is as follows: The motorized patrol team of the First Division of our army was ambushed at 12:15 yesterday on the way from Tianjin to the destination, near the Da Xia Shahe (transliteration) north of Hexiwu, about 35 miles southeast of Beiping. The troops attacking the patrol team were Chinese armed forces in military uniforms, about 300 people.

Our side has casualties, and the troops attacking our side also have casualties. We do not intend to comment on this issue much at this time. It is confirmed that a patrol team of about 300 people has rushed to the scene of the incident to assist the besieged U.S. Marine Corps, and according to one source: By the time the patrol team arrived at the battlefield, the battle was almost over, but the team continued to drive towards Beiping, clearing the remaining enemy nests on the highway.

### Du and Li Talks Yield No Results on the Overall Northeast Issue; But the Status Quo in Ningjing Can Continue to be Maintained

[Special Dispatch from Shenyang, This Paper, 30th] Wang Zhimin, Director of the Propaganda Department of the Xingying, Cai Zonglian, Military Regulation, and Li Minran, Lin Biao's representative, held a trial talk at 4:30 PM on the 29th on the issue of exchanging prisoners of war on both sides. The government side advocated that both sides immediately release the prisoners of war. Li said that Lin Biao did not authorize him, so he could not negotiate fully. Therefore, although it took a long time, it was only limited to exchanging opinions and no concrete results were obtained.

[Special Dispatch from Shenyang, 29th] Although Li Minran's visit to Shenyang this time is still far from fundamental agreement on the Northeast issue, a relatively peaceful status quo may be maintained. It is said that he once expressed on behalf of Lin Biao that the Communist troops will never attack, and Du Yuming also frankly stated that as long as the Communist troops do not attack or cause trouble, the National Army will never fire the first shot. (2) Du Yuming told reporters that he had exchanged views with Li on the overall issue in principle, and it was regrettable that no results were obtained in the past two days. (3) The issue of power transmission in Shenyang was resolved by Dong Wenqi and Li Minran. Shenyang City will soon be bright again. The reason why this issue can be resolved is that the Harbin power grid is under the control of the National Army. After this method was agreed upon, both parties no longer had the fear of power outages.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 30th] Cai Zonglian and Li Minran flew to Changchun from Shenyang at 3:00 PM this afternoon.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 29th] Lin Biao's representative Li Minran had a seven-hour conversation with Commander Du over the past two days. Both sides expressed strong views on the military conflict, and neither side will attack in the future. In addition, there were also discussions on the transfer of electricity to Xiaoxing, the exchange of prisoners, the repatriation of Japanese residents in the Communist-controlled areas, and the repair of the Songhua River Bridge. A Central News Agency reporter visited Commander Du, Li Minran, and Colonel Norman, the U.S. representative of the Executive Group, separately to inquire about the results and impressions of the negotiations. Li said that he had talked with Commander Du twice in the past two days. Commander Du expressed his opinions frankly, not only involving general small issues, but also fundamental issues in the Northeast. When the reporter asked about the opening of the Zhongchang Road, Li said that this issue should be realized as soon as possible, and the Communist troops are very willing to promote it, but the specific method should be agreed upon immediately. The reporter then asked Commander Du for his opinion. Du said that he was very welcome and excited that Mr. Li could represent Mr. Lin Biao in negotiating the overall issue in the Northeast, but he regretted that no results were obtained in the past two days. In general, both sides exchanged opinions on principle. In short, any issues that can be resolved are hoped to be resolved immediately. As for avoiding conflict, I guarantee that there will be no problems as long as the Communist troops do not disturb the National Army. The opening of the Zhongchang Road should be realized as soon as possible in order to relieve the suffering of the people. At the same time, repairing the Songhua River Bridge is for the sake of construction and the people's livelihood, and the bridge should be completed as soon as possible. The reporter then asked the U.S. representative Colonel Norman about this issue. He expressed three opinions: first, stop the conflict; second, restore traffic immediately so that the people can get food; third, political issues should be resolved according to public opinion. After hearing this, Li immediately proposed that the Changchun Executive Department study and solve the plan. Commander Du said: The Changchun Executive Department will never oppose it, because this matter is of great importance to the people's livelihood, and besides, the bridge is in the hands of the National Army, so there should be no problem in restoring it. Colonel Norman agreed with Commander Du's opinion, and Li explained that there is no problem with general bridges, but today's repair of the Songhua River Bridge between Chang and Ha inevitably has strategic significance. Colonel Norman suggested that a neutral zone be set up on the bridge. Commander Du believed that after the bridge was repaired, he could guarantee that the National Army would never attack, and the Executive Group could send personnel to station on the bridge. Colonel Norman smiled and agreed. Commander Du then smiled and said: Is Colonel Norman willing to go? Colonel Norman smiled and replied that he was willing to go. Commander Du also said: The purpose of building this bridge is for construction and rural revitalization. Colonel Norman also agreed with this point and said: If the National Army attacks, the route will not be limited to this bridge. Finally, Li accepted Commander Du's bridge repair plan and said that he was willing to do his personal best to promote its realization and report to Lin Biao after returning to Harbin.

Wang himself secretly arrived in Jinan on the 28th to pay respects to the military and political leaders and report that the Communist Party was causing harm to the country and the people in Shandong, and that senior generals were mutually hostile and fought each other, and that the internal division was imminent. Therefore, he resolutely defected, and his troops are gathering in their defense areas, and are in mixed warfare with the chasing Communist troops.

### Legislative Yuan Interrogation of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA): Heated Debate at Routine Meeting; Director Jiang Attends and Answers Item by Item

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 30th] During this morning's Legislative Yuan routine meeting, a heated debate erupted between Executive Yuan UNRRA Director Jiang Tingfu and members of the Legislative Yuan regarding post-war relief and rehabilitation efforts. This verbal battle began with Zhang Zhaoyuan, convener of the Legislative Yuan's Nine-Member Committee, launching an attack. Representing the committee, he presented five questions to the UNRRA Director based on their findings: (1) Why was cotton sold to Shanghai textile mills at low prices, while the administration sat idly by as these mills reaped exorbitant profits? (2) Why was it possible to sell 59,000 tons of flour in Shanghai alone, while the extensive disaster areas of Henan and Hunan provinces received only tens of thousands of tons? (3) Why, with Henan suffering a black fever epidemic and a 90% mortality rate, were over 8,700 tons of relief medicines stockpiled in Shanghai, while Henan province had yet to receive any? (4) Why were supplies stockpiled in Shanghai warehouses, resulting in relief goods being unable to unload upon arrival in Shanghai and being redirected to other countries? (5) Why, with the inefficiency of foreign ships in transporting relief supplies, did the government prioritize foreign shipping, disregarding the opposition of domestic shipping companies? Zhang concluded by stating: According to Finance Minister Yu's report, the government's post-war relief and rehabilitation fund of 432 billion had been fully allocated, of which 28.9 billion was for the UNRRA's administrative expenses. With UNRRA branch offices established in 15 districts and employing over 5,000 personnel, such a massive organization and ample funding ran counter to the original purpose of post-war relief and rehabilitation. It has resulted in our country's inability to effectively utilize the received materials, with goods being discarded, leading to the UNRRA's suspension of shipments. Director Jiang immediately responded: (1) Most of the materials stockpiled in Shanghai were machines that could not be shipped. (2) Most of the medical supplies were hygiene and medical equipment. (3) The previous sales of relief goods were with the consent of the UNRRA, aimed at recovering legal tender and stabilizing prices. Finally, Director Jiang frankly admitted that due to the different viewpoints on relief issues between the donor countries and the recipient country, the UNRRA's work was quite unsuccessful. After Director Jiang finished speaking, members Huang Yinggan, Sun Jiulu, Chen Zifeng, Peng Zuishi, Wei Tingsheng, Zhong Tianxin, Jian Guansan, and others spoke up one after another, raising questions about (1) the UNRRA staff's excessively high salaries, (2) the accounting system's non-compliance with government regulations, and (3) the alleged corruption in the transportation of relief rice to Guangdong. Director Jiang promised to thoroughly investigate the corruption allegations and handle them according to law, but stated that the slightly higher salaries for staff were precisely intended to prevent corruption. Until 11:30 AM, Director Jiang requested to leave due to other matters, but many members continued to criticize the UNRRA's measures.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] The Legislative Yuan held its 305th meeting today, presided over by President Sun, with Vice President Wei, who recently took office, also attending for the first time. In the morning, UNRRA Director Jiang gave a report and answered questions from the members. In the afternoon, the following important cases were passed: (1) The draft amendment to the Goods Unified Tax Regulations was resolved to be amended and passed. (2) The draft amendment to the National Product Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Regulations was resolved to be passed. (3) The Standard Law draft was resolved to be returned to the Economic and Legal Affairs Committees for re-examination. (4) The draft amendment to the Constitution of the International Labour Organization was resolved to be ratified. (5) The draft legislative principles for amending the Customs Import and Export Tariff were amended and passed, and submitted to the Supreme National Defense Council. (6) The draft regulations for the organization of the Agricultural and Forestry Department's Cattle Improvement and Breeding Farm was resolved to be passed.

The welcoming crowd grew larger and larger, with men, women, old and young holding small welcoming flags and shouting "Long Live the Republic of China," numbering over ten thousand people. Yu was crowded by the crowd and could hardly move, so he had to get back in the car and pass through Shule City to Shufu. The 15 kilometers in between were filled with welcoming lines. He arrived at the Commissioner's Office for rest at about 1:00 PM. A welcoming party was held by all sectors here at 9:00 PM. On the morning of the 27th, Yu attended the welcoming rally of the citizens of Kashgar.

[Our Dispatch, Beiping, 30th] The delegation of Tibetan monks attending the National Assembly, led by Dansang Biso Langwangdui, arrived in Beiping yesterday. The remaining three, including Dorje Odzhu, are expected to arrive tomorrow. They are accustomed to the plateau and cannot tolerate the severe heat of Nanjing and Chongqing. They were planning to go to Mount Wutai this month to avoid the heat, but due to the lack of supplies for their daily life there, they came to the old capital to escape the summer heat. They will stay here for about one or two months, and will return to Nanjing as soon as the weather cools. Shen Zonglian, Director of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission's Resident Office in Tibet, is also expected to come to Beiping in the near future.

### Measures for Collecting and Exchanging Northeast Soviet Military Scrip Determined: Official Exchange Rate to be Determined After Collection

[Our Dispatch, Beiping, 29th] The temporary measures for the collection and exchange of Northeast Soviet military scrip have been agreed upon by the Northeast Headquarters Economic Committee and the Ministry of Finance. Holders of Soviet military scrip can temporarily exchange it for 10% of circulating banknotes at the Central Bank, with the remaining 90% issued a receipt by the Central Bank. The official exchange rate and refund method will be determined after the military scrip is collected. The authorities have taken this measure because the exact number of Soviet military scrip issued is unknown, so they have decided to determine the exchange rate after collection.

[Our Dispatch, Jiyang, 30th] On the 29th, newspapers reported that the authorities had drafted measures to handle Soviet Red Army scrip circulating in various parts of Northeast China, and that they would be officially announced soon. This immediately caused unrest in the market. Some people were picky about slightly damaged or soiled scrip and refused to accept it. Others, although they did not dare to openly refuse to use it, raised prices to resist it. It is said that many raised prices by 20%. Large-scale transactions agreed in advance what kind of scrip would be used for the transaction. The Central Bank never accepts Red Army scrip, while China, Communications, Farmers, and general local commercial banks still accept it, but those who deposit Red Army scrip are marked on the receipt. Many street vendors and rickshaw pullers refuse to accept Red Army scrip. The general opinion and newspaper editorials are that the government should immediately announce the handling measures to avoid causing financial chaos and public unease.

### Telegram from Garrison of Taixing

To the Editorial Department of Shanghai Shen Bao: I previously read in your newspaper on the 17th that a piece of news was published that the National Army had recovered Taixing, which is inconsistent with the facts. Taixing was surrounded by the Communist Army until it had been through a three-book battle with this regiment, and finally retreated to Huangqiao due to heavy casualties. To this day, the entire territory of Taixing has been cleared by the Communist Army. From the beginning to the end, this regiment has been responsible for this task, and no friendly forces have been involved. The heads of government and the people of the whole county can testify to this. Special telegram please check for. Commander Liu Guangyu of the 56th National Regiment of the 19th Brigade of the 83rd Reorganized Division of the Army, Noon, Gan, Song.

[Our Dispatch, Hankou, 30th] Xia Guangyu, Director of the Pinghan Railway Bureau, has returned to Hankou after supervising the repair of the Yellow River Railway Bridge. According to him, the situation of the bridge has eased after days and nights of repair, and the bridge body can be guaranteed to be unharmed.

Editorial

### Unfolding a New Page in Sino-British Relations

Our newly appointed ambassador to the UK, Zheng Tianxi, has recently arrived in London, and the UK's newly appointed ambassador to China, Sir Ralph Stevenson, has followed Sir Seymour to take office in China. He passed through Shanghai yesterday on his way to Beijing, and will soon be going to Guling to present his credentials to President Chiang. A new page in Sino-British relations is about to unfold.

At this time when the Far Eastern situation is in dire need of clarification, we cannot help but place deep expectations on Ambassador Stevenson's arrival in China. Not only does Sir Stevenson have a special knowledge and understanding of Far Eastern issues, but he is also an experienced diplomat. The British government's appointment of such an outstanding figure to handle diplomatic affairs between China and Britain in the complex and complicated Far East is, of course, more than appropriate.

Needless to say, in the diplomatic history of China and Britain, there are indeed some points that are unbearable to look back on. In the past, the corruption of the Manchu Qing government and the imperialist policies taken by foreign countries should be held responsible for these points. However, since the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army, Britain has gradually changed its policies over the past two decades, and after the Great War, China and Britain were on the same side of the enemy, becoming friends in adversity. The friendship between the two countries is bound to be consolidated after this test. During the Great War, China and Britain were in almost the same position. China was fighting alone in the Far East, fighting a desperate battle with the Japanese invaders. After the surrender of France, Britain became the lone army in Europe, and under the leadership of Prime Minister Churchill, it was persevering and unyielding, and finally turned the entire war situation from danger to safety. Therefore, China and Britain have suffered the greatest losses in this war, but they have also made special contributions to victory. China can fully understand Britain, and Britain will fully understand China. At the Chinese National Flag Day held in London this May, British celebrities and scholars gave speeches, praising China's hard resistance and great contribution to victory. Even after the end of the war, the situation in China and Britain is still quite similar. Everyone needs "stability" and everyone needs "prosperity". Although Britain is unable to actively assist China's revival in material terms after the war, the British government and public alike hope that China can become a strong, unified, and democratic country, and their enthusiasm is no less than that of any allied country. As Ambassador Stevenson said in London after being appointed: "Britain has no other ambitions in China than commerce, and is eager for China to become a strong, stable, and unified country, so that it can assume important tasks in maintaining the effective tools of world peace (ie, the United Nations). The British government will do its utmost to assist China within the greatest possible scope, so that China can become a strong and unified country." This is what Britain hopes of China; and this is what China hopes Britain will assist it in.

It can be seen from this that, due to the changes in the international situation after the war, Britain's China policy has also shifted from politics to economics. In order to promote trade with China, Britain plans to send a delegation to China to conduct on-the-spot investigations of commercial conditions. Even former Foreign Secretary Eden expressed his willingness to visit China, and delivered a speech at the Sino-British Chamber of Commerce, saying: "Britain has deep sympathy for China. China was the first country to rise up against aggression, and we cannot forget it, nor will we ever forget it; China resisted Japanese aggression for longer than Britain resisted aggression. At present, international trade is fraught with difficulties due to the turbulence and unrest of the situation. Hesitation and obstruction can be seen everywhere; but these obstacles are not unavoidable. I also strongly agree with the British government's dispatch of a business delegation to China, which is the most appropriate measure to promote trade between the two countries." Eden can be said to be a true friend of China. Ambassador Stevenson once served as the Chief Secretary to Foreign Secretary Eden, and must have a common understanding of his views, and intends to find ways to promote their realization. At present, some people in British financial circles, due to a lack of knowledge, do not understand China's national conditions very well, and express pessimism about the prospects of China's revival and nation-building; but enlightened people, especially the Sino-British Chamber of Commerce, have the clearest understanding and are completely optimistic, and firmly advocate promoting trade between the two countries. For example, Panks, the president of the association, said: "Britain should do its best to establish economic ties with China, and should work hard to promote trade between the two countries even during the difficult transition period." In the past few days, the British House of Commons is also going to discuss Sino-British business relations. We sincerely hope that the British government can decide on a trade policy with China as soon as possible, especially how to use capital and technology to assist China's industrial development.

The British Labour Party has been in power for nearly a year since succeeding the Conservative Party, and has adopted a more enlightened policy in both its domestic and foreign affairs. Especially in diplomacy, the enlightened measures of the Labour government are worthy of our admiration. Prime Minister Attlee not only allowed India to become independent, but also announced that British troops would withdraw from Egypt, which has won worldwide acclaim. Therefore, we do not believe that the British Labour government will ignore the unresolved Hong Kong issue. Because the three giants, Luo, Qiu, and Jiang, had already decided at the Cairo Conference that Hong Kong should be returned to China, there is absolutely no problem in principle; moreover, Hong Kong is still under British rule, it will no longer be a gem on the British crown, but has become a layer of separation in Sino-British friendship. Therefore, we believe that once the time is ripe, the Hong Kong issue can be negotiated and resolved reasonably. Ambassador Stevenson also expressed this view when he arrived in Singapore. Britain is the birthplace of democratic politics, and today's politics are also most in line with democratic principles; all the measures taken by the government in domestic affairs are based on public opinion, and the government will also pay special attention to international justice and the national aspirations of other countries. Therefore, as Ambassador Stevenson takes office in China, we would like to specifically mention that: Please have Britain return Hong Kong and Kowloon to China, which is the national aspiration unanimously demanded by our country. Ambassador Stevenson must be able to see clearly that only after this blemish is removed can the history of Sino-British relations have a truly new page.

### Sudden Rise in Old Yellow River Waters in Xuzhou; Flood Prevention Team Delineates Areas for Emergency Blocking

[Special Dispatch from our Xuzhou Correspondent] Due to continuous rainy weather, the water level of the Old Yellow River in our city began to rise sharply from 8:00 PM on the 24th. The water level continued to rise throughout the night, and by the morning of the following day, the area outside the city moat at the Fourth Inspection Station was completely submerged. The water was surging powerfully, threatening to breach the moat and flood into the city. The Municipal Government's Bureau of Public Works and the Police Bureau, together with the District Office, dispatched personnel to investigate and mobilized laborers to take emergency measures to prevent any untoward incidents. Unexpectedly, at 12:30 PM, before the mobilized laborers could arrive, the river water had already breached the moat and flooded into the Old Yellow River embankment area within the city. The water flow was rapid, and the water level rose sharply. In particular, the area west of Zemin Bridge was in danger of flooding into the city streets at any moment. Fortunately, the 88th Engineering Corps and civilian laborers arrived and bravely fought to reinforce the embankments, ensuring no further breaches occurred. To strengthen protection, the Municipal Government convened a meeting of the heads of the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, the Police Bureau, and other relevant units to discuss flood prevention and blocking measures. It was decided to establish a flood prevention team, with Police Chief Zhu Gongyan as the team leader, and Bureau of Public Works Director Zheng and the First and Tenth District Chiefs as his deputies, responsible for flood prevention and blocking. The Old Yellow River in the urban area was divided into four flood prevention zones: (1) the area west of Qingyun Bridge, (2) Qingyun Bridge to Jizhong Bridge, (3) Jizhong Bridge to Liji Bridge, and (4) the area south of Liji Bridge. The simple houses made of wooden planks and reed mats that were usually built on the riverbanks of the Old Yellow River were submerged by the evening of the 26th, with only the rooftops occasionally visible. This left 400 impoverished families homeless. By night, the water level had risen more than eight feet above normal.

### Various Counties in Northern Anhui Disaster Area Actively Eradicate Locusts

[Special Dispatch from our Bengbu Correspondent] Since the beginning of summer, locusts in various counties in northern Anhui have been breeding rapidly, devouring crops and causing widespread damage. The Locust Control Supervisory Office of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry in Anhui, together with the Locust Control Task Force of the Anhui Relief Sub-Bureau, has been promoting locust control efforts. They have mobilized farmers in counties such as ____, Mingguang, Jiashan, and Fengyang to actively control locusts, with the assistance of relevant authorities, resulting in significant effectiveness. It is now reported that the Locust Control Task Force has moved north along the Jinpu Railway, with its headquarters set up in Bengbu. The Supervisory Office will also move here, planning to use the "work-for-relief" method to encourage the public to actively control locusts, increasing the standard for flour distribution. Locust control drugs and bait materials have been rationally allocated, with Fengyang, Dingyuan, Suxian, Hefei, Mengcheng, Fengtai, Huaiyuan, and other counties designated as pilot areas. It is expected that after the deployment of technical personnel and the use of control methods, locusts will be significantly reduced.

After a thorough investigation, the Commissioner's Office summoned Cai Jichen on the 25th. Commissioner Xu personally presided over the trial, where Cai Jichen confessed to his crimes. Commissioner Xu, considering that the village head was a self-governance official, not only reprimanded him in court but also ordered his immediate arrest and imprisonment as a warning to other corrupt officials.

Hangzhou

Request to Waive Land Tax and Replace it with Legal Tender

Fuyang's grain production has always been insufficient to meet its own needs, requiring the purchase of grain from elsewhere. This year, due to the low prices of the county's specialty products, paper and tea, the economy is struggling, making it difficult to collect grain to meet the land tax. It is now reported that the Chairman of the County Council, Hua Yiren, and the Vice-Chairman, Li ____'an, along with councilors Hong Daonan and others, have come to the provincial capital to join eleven councilors in Hangzhou, including Wang Shaogong, to petition the provincial government to waive the collection of accumulated grain as tax and replace it with legal tender.

Changshu

Who Conducted the Security and Population Check?

In order to safeguard the security of the urban area, the City Defense Command convened a temporary emergency security meeting on the night of the 25th. The heads of all police stations in the urban area and representatives from the self-defense teams attended. Several important cases were discussed and resolved. Hu Yongyan, the head of the Security and Inspection ____, together with the Police Bureau and the self-defense teams of ____ Gong, Siqian, Dongcang, ____ Le, and Anjing towns, conducted a thorough overnight population check. Several dozen men and women, including Wang Xingru and Zhang Caihong, who were suspected of suspicious activities, were detained. After investigation and being found innocent, they were released on bail. The county government highly commended the cooperation of the self-defense teams with the military and police, and decided to issue a commendation order to encourage them.

Wuxi

Village Head Accused of Extorting Money and Charged with Duty Neglect

Chen Heng____, the village head of Xiadian Village in Dongting District, the deputy village head Chen Jicun, assistants Chen Zu____, and Yang ____ ____, colluded to collect a registration fee of 200 yuan from each household under the guise of issuing citizen oath certificates on the 9th of this month. They threatened to withhold the certificates if the fee was not paid. The villagers, unaware of the underlying situation, paid the fees, totaling over 500,000 yuan. All of this money was divided and used privately. Afterwards, villagers learned that there was no such regulation and that other villages did not pay this fee, clearly indicating extortion. It has been discovered that the village head, deputy village head, and assistants had repeatedly held positions under the puppet regime, oppressing the people and committing numerous evil deeds. Now, they have transformed themselves and are once again holding official positions. The entire citizenry of the village has specially dispatched representatives, including Zhang Wenyi, to the city court to file a lawsuit with the prosecutor's office, requesting their arrest and legal prosecution.

### Plenary Session of the Peace Conference Held Yesterday Afternoon; Byrnes Delivers Speech; Procedural Committee Decides to Allow Journalists to Observe; Review of Credentials May Encounter Considerable Difficulties

[News Agency Report] London, 30th Broadcast: The Rules of Procedure Committee, which is tasked with deciding the methods for the Peace Conference, held its first meeting today. Contrary to general expectations, it did not take action on the issue of passing resolutions by a majority or two-thirds vote, which is considered a contentious issue. However, another important resolution was passed: Byrnes proposed that when the Peace Conference discusses treaties with Italy, Romania, and other countries, journalists should be allowed to attend publicly. This proposal was supported by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and Australian representative Evatt and was subsequently approved. Belgian representative Hynbaert was elected Chairman of the committee, and Yugoslav representative Benderjer was elected Vice-Chairman.

[Reuters, Paris, 30th] When the Paris Peace Conference convenes at 4:00 PM today (midnight Shanghai time), US Secretary of State Byrnes will be the first to speak. The Procedural Committee held a meeting at 10:00 AM, which Byrnes also attended as the US representative. Byrnes will reiterate his previous remarks, advocating that both the plenary session and special committees should allow journalists to observe. The Procedural Committee will decide on this matter.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 29th] Regarding the review of the credentials of the 21 European countries attending the Peace Conference, well-informed sources here say that this issue may cause some difficulties this afternoon. The Allied delegations have included the foreign ministers of the Baltic states as representatives to attend the Peace Conference. However, the United Kingdom and the United States have never recognized the incorporation of these small countries into the Soviet Union. Therefore, the British and American representatives may question whether the foreign ministers of the Baltic states can effectively serve as representatives of the Soviet Union. According to previous conferences, each country is limited to five plenipotentiary representatives. It is rumored that the Soviet representatives may request an increase in the number of representatives, and it is believed that this request may encounter opposition from some representatives.

[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 29th] The official announcement states that the Italian delegation to the Peace Conference will be led by Prime Minister Gasperi, with members including President of the Constituent Assembly Saragat, former Prime Minister Bonomi, and the Italian ambassadors to the United Kingdom, the United States, Poland, and Brazil, as well as several experts.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 29th] It is reported that the Iranian Ambassador to France, Raikhmanei, recently sent a note to the four major powers requesting to participate in the Peace Conference.

### Key Points of the Draft Treaties with Hungary, Bulgaria, Finland, and Romania

Hungarian Treaty

[News Agency Report] Washington Broadcast, Paris Report: The four major powers have agreed to stipulate in the treaty with Hungary that Hungary should pay reparations of $300 million. However, the United States reserves the right to oppose imposing such a burden on the former Axis satellite state, which is experiencing extreme currency inflation. Regarding military matters, the treaty with Hungary stipulates that Hungary's standing army should be reduced to one-tenth of its pre-war size, not exceeding 70,000 personnel, with an air force quota not exceeding 5,000 personnel and a maximum of 90 aircraft. The treaty also stipulates that the Soviet Union may retain "the necessary number of troops" in Hungary to ensure transportation routes to the Soviet-occupied zone of Austria. Other Allied troops will be completely withdrawn within 90 days after the formal signing of the treaty. As for the border lines, they will remain as they were before the war, with half of Outer Transylvania returned to Romania.

Bulgarian Treaty

[News Agency Report] Washington Broadcast, Paris Report: In the draft treaty with Bulgaria prepared by the four major powers, the issues of the Bulgarian-Greek border and the amount of reparations Bulgaria owes to Greece and Yugoslavia remain unresolved. Regarding the border issue, the four powers believe that both Bulgaria and Greece can present their different opinions to the Peace Conference for further decision. After the First World War, Bulgaria was forced to cede the Thrace region to Greece. During this war, when German troops entered Bulgaria, they "took back" this region from Greece and returned it to Bulgaria. Bulgaria declared war on the United Kingdom and the United States on December 13, 1941, but remained neutral during the German-Soviet war. However, the Soviet Union did not recognize its neutrality and still declared war on Bulgaria. The treaty also stipulates that Bulgaria's army will be limited to 55,000 personnel, the navy to 3,500 personnel, ships to 7,520 tons, and aircraft to 90.

Finnish Treaty

[News Agency Report] London, 30th Broadcast: In the draft treaty with Finland prepared by the four major powers, it is proposed to limit the size of the Finnish army to no more than 34,400 personnel. Finland's naval personnel should not exceed 4,500, the total tonnage of ships should not exceed 10,000 tons, and the army and navy aircraft should not exceed 60, and new types of aircraft are not allowed to be acquired. Finland should lease Porkkala to the Soviet Union for 50 years, where the latter can establish a naval base. In addition, Finland should cede the northwestern part of the Beluk province to the Soviet Union. As for Finland's reparations to the Soviet Union, they should be limited to $300 million, to be paid off in eight years from September 1, 1955, with payments made in goods, including timber, river vessels, and machinery.

Romanian Treaty [Agence France-Presse, Paris, 30th] The full text of the draft peace treaty with Romania, prepared by the representatives of the four foreign ministers, was distributed to the representatives of the 21 countries yesterday. The original text was released tonight at 11:00 PM. Its main points are as follows: (1) The border between Romania and Hungary should be restored to its original state as of January 1, 1938. All border changes after that date are invalid. (2) Romania should release all political prisoners who sympathize with the United Nations' cause, disband all fascist organizations, and eliminate all anti-Soviet and anti-United Nations propaganda agencies. (3) Arrest all war criminals and criminals who endanger peace or humanity. (4) Land, sea, and air force armaments are limited to those necessary for protecting domestic security, and excess personnel should be demobilized within six months after the treaty comes into effect. (5) The remaining materials should be handed over to the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union.

### Italy's Territory Reduced

Only Remains a Long Boot-Shaped Region

Military Armaments Subject to Strict Restrictions

[United Press, Paris, 30th] According to the draft treaty with Italy, Italy's once-proud war machine will be reduced to almost theater-level performance, and Mussolini's empire, which once aspired to rival Caesar's Roman Empire, will be reduced to a long boot-shaped region. In addition, there are various penalties for Italy's reckless wars, such as reparations of $100 million to the Soviet Union, which have been agreed upon by the four powers. However, other disputed issues, such as the boundaries of the Trieste Free Territory and the amount of reparations to France, Yugoslavia, Greece, and other countries damaged by US participation in the war, have not yet been agreed upon.

### Foreign Minister Wang and Byrnes Held Talks

[Central News Agency, Paris, 29th Special Dispatch] Wang Shijie, the chief representative of our delegation to the Peace Conference, visited US chief representative Byrnes this morning for an informal exchange of views.

### Postal and Telegraph Employees in Paris Suddenly Strike Yesterday

[News Agency Report] London, 30th Broadcast: 200,000 telegraph employees in Paris suddenly went on strike today, greatly affecting the transmission of news from the Peace Conference.

[United Press, Paris, 29th] The French Postal and Telegraph Workers' Union, demanding a pay raise, called on all postal, telegraph, and telephone workers to strike for ten hours from 3:00 AM to 1:00 PM on the 30th to support their demands.

### War-Torn Areas Reconstruction Committee Meeting; Our Representative Expresses Views

[Agence France-Presse, London, 29th] At today's meeting of the War-Torn Areas Reconstruction Committee, the Chinese representative declared on the spot that no less than 186 million Chinese people had been under the enemy's iron heel, and the losses caused by the enemy's plunder and destruction were estimated at approximately 1.3 trillion US dollars. This shows the urgency and breadth of China's need for reconstruction. The assistance needed by war-torn countries should not be considered charity but rather economic unity. The French representative, who is the chairman of the committee, Pagana, said that France values coal more than diamonds. France has only one desire, which is to accelerate recovery and participate in the world's reconstruction efforts.

### United Kingdom Principally Accepts US Proposal to Unify German Economy; Pravda Publishes Article Explaining Soviet Attitude

[United States Information Service, Washington, 29th] The US State Department announced today that it has received a note from the British government stating that it principally accepts Byrnes' proposal to economically unify the German occupation zones with the US occupation zone. The State Department welcomes this expression from the British side, believing that this is the first step to relieve the significant financial burden on the British and American occupation countries and the economic downturn in the British and American occupation zones, as the German economy has lost its interdependence since Germany was divided into four autonomous zones. The State Department hopes that other occupation countries will also respond to Byrnes' proposal in the same way. "The US government believes that all countries will benefit greatly if they can promote Germany's economic integration in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement." A State Department spokesman also said that the Allies have begun discussing the issue of German economic unification in Berlin.

[Reuters, London, 29th] Moscow Radio reported that Pravda said that the US plan to merge the economies of the German occupation zones is intended to be anti-Soviet. It also said that the Soviet Union believes that the prerequisites for unifying Germany are to implement the Potsdam Declaration, eliminate Nazi forces, and disarm Germany militarily and economically.

### Situation on the Opening Day of the Peace Conference

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 29th] The European Peace Conference of 21 countries held its first meeting at 3:03 PM this afternoon (Greenwich Mean Time, 30th at 0:03 AM Shanghai time) in the Luxembourg Palace, and adjourned at 4:23 PM. The atmosphere in the meeting was solemn and ____, rarely seen in previous international conferences. Half an hour before the opening, representatives from various countries arrived together. Representatives from some countries were wearing their national uniforms, forming groups of twos and threes. There were also several women among them. There were many journalists. At 3:00 PM sharp, the heads of delegations from various countries were led into the venue by US Secretary of State Byrnes.

[Reuters, Paris, 29th] The Paris Peace Conference opened today. French Foreign Minister Bidault delivered a welcoming speech first (see separate cable for the text), and then announced the start of the conference. US representative Byrnes then proposed that Bidault be the temporary chairman of the conference and Dibac be the secretary-general, and that Bidault's term be approved unanimously by the conference. After Bidault took the chair, he proposed that UN Secretary-General Lie be invited to attend the Peace Conference as a guest and observer of the United Nations organization. He then proposed China, Australia, Belarus, Brazil, Czechoslovakia, Abyssinia, the Netherlands and other seven countries as members of the Credentials Review Committee, which was passed. It was also decided that the committee should meet one hour before the meeting tomorrow. At this point, Australian Foreign Minister Evatt stepped onto the podium and expressed the hope that the Procedural Committee would not only be a procedural committee in the ordinary sense but also determine the organization of the conference, which is extremely important. For example, how many votes the Foreign Ministers' recommendations should get should be passed by the committee. The Australian government believes that procedural issues are related to the status of the conference itself. Mr. Evatt continued to urge the chairman of the conference to convene the committee immediately, because the principle issues related to the status of the 17 participating countries also need to be discussed by the committee. According to the Moscow Declaration of last December, the Procedural Committee can decide what the true authority of this conference is for the final treaty, and the 17 countries should have equal power with the Foreign Ministers' meeting to decide the final treaty. This point must be clarified. We should decide whether this conference adopts a simple majority system or a special majority system. Pichell then suggested that the Procedural Committee should meet at 10:00 AM tomorrow. As chairman, he sincerely hoped to satisfy the wishes of the various delegations. Tomorrow's conference will start at 4:00 PM in the afternoon, starting with general discussions, and the Credentials Review Committee will meet one hour earlier. There was no objection in the conference venue, and the adjournment was announced.

Key Points of Bidault's Speech

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 29th] French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Bidault recently delivered a welcoming speech at the closing of the European Peace Conference, saying: "I represent the people and government of France in welcoming representatives of the United Nations and friendly countries to Paris to hold the first large-scale international conference to discuss and resolve various post-war issues. I believe that the representatives of all countries will be able to work together in a spirit of friendship and cooperation to address the important tasks they face. After the First World War, the main reason for the failure of the peace conference held in Paris was that the two major powers, although decisive in the war, remained aloof when making peace. But now these phenomena no longer exist, and all democratic countries are now participating in the discussion. Because of the common ideals of all countries in the world for peace, the United Nations organization was born, and the foreign ministers of various countries have been engaged in various preparatory work in London and Paris. There have been complaints about the conference procedures and its repeated postponements. In fact, the difficulties we have encountered are very significant because the interests represented by all parties are not easy to compromise, and some principles necessary for international policy must be observed. Speaking of the tasks undertaken by the representatives of various countries attending the conference, the issues raised to you are only a part of peacemaking, which are extremely difficult and extremely complex and have a significant impact on the interests of European countries. However, I firmly believe that our joint discussions on this matter will find a solution, even if it is not perfect, but at least it is a reasonable way that does not deviate from justice and glory."

### Continued Trial of Japanese Invasion of China: International Tribunal Hears Testimony Yesterday

[Reconstruction Society Tokyo, 30th] The Far East International Tribunal today first heard witness Lawrence continue to describe how the Japanese poisoned the Chinese people in North China, stating that after the Japanese army occupied Beiping, opium and morphine were openly sold. Most of these drugs were transported into the city by Japanese army trucks. The defense did not cross-examine Lawrence's testimony. The testimony of witnesses summoned since June 12th has now concluded, as have the four days of testimony regarding the Nanjing Massacre. The defendants' defense team remained completely silent regarding this horrific and bloody event. Prosecutor Sa Tung thoroughly pursued the atrocities of the Japanese army, especially exposing the brutal treatment of women by the Japanese army. The number of Japanese women attending the hearings is increasing daily, which is a notable characteristic in recent days. The court continued to hear the case of the Japanese invasion of Northeast and North China. The prosecution presented Chinese government documents (the establishment process of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council), the Japan Yearbook's description of the puppet organization in eastern Hebei and the Hebei Political Council, Ambassador Ariyoshi's May 1936 report to Foreign Minister Arita regarding Inner Mongolia policy, and Chinese diplomatic documents describing illegal flights of Japanese aircraft in North China. Ariyoshi's secret telegram to Arita stated: "According to military reports, the work in Inner Mongolia has recently made considerable progress. From April 21st to 26th, Prince De, Li Shouxin, Wu Heling, and the head of the Tanaka Special Agency held a so-called nation-building conference, resolving to build Qinghai and Mongolia into one country and conclude a mutual assistance agreement with the puppet Manchukuo, with Prince Yun as chairman, and Princes Suo and Sha as vice-chairmen, and Prince De as commander-in-chief, etc." The prosecution also presented the "Essentials for Handling North China" decided by the Japanese government in 1937, which stated that the means to handle North China were to make North China a communist prevention zone, while seizing resources, securing transportation, to defend against the Soviet Union, and to form a "cooperation" between China, Japan, and "Manchukuo." To achieve this goal, the main effort should be focused on economic work targeting the people of North China and to make the central government assist in this policy.

### Hull and Zhou Enlai Reportedly to be Invited to Testify

At the same time, rumors say that the Japanese defense team wants to summon US Senator Brewster and Congressman Gearhart to Japan to testify. One of them signed the minority report of the Pearl Harbor Investigative Committee, accusing the late President Roosevelt and Hull of guilt for the cause of the incident. It is generally expected that Hull will be questioned about foreign policy before December 7, 1941, and Zhou Enlai may support the defendant's argument, saying that the division within China during the Northeast Incident allowed Japan to use local governments as targets, unwilling to engage with the central government.

### From the Palestine Question (Part 1) to British Middle East Policy

— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper in Britain, Xueyan

[London Correspondence, July 2nd] At midnight on June 28th, British forces in Palestine suddenly declared martial law in major cities, prohibiting traffic. Under this martial law, they searched the headquarters of the Jewish Agency and its branches in various locations, arresting executive members of the Jewish Agency and searching for illegal arms of the Haganah, the security force organized by the Jewish Agency. In addition, over two thousand suspected Jews were detained for interrogation. This event, from its launch to the date of this reporter's writing, has lasted four days, but the tense situation in Palestine has not eased slightly. The reactions from various parties, especially the United States, are also not clear, seemingly waiting for the continued development of the situation. Its seriousness is very obvious.

The decision for this action came from the British Cabinet. The American authorities were notified in advance, but their opinions were not sought. British Prime Minister Attlee made a special statement in the House of Commons yesterday (July 1st) afternoon, explaining the motives and determination of the British government in taking this action. The general idea was: The British authorities in Palestine have obtained conclusive evidence that the recent terrorist actions in Palestine were supported in an organized manner by the Haganah and some leaders of the Jewish Agency. The British government took this decisive measure to maintain law and order, aiming to eliminate the root of terrorism, and not to antagonize the entire Jewish community in Palestine. It is hoped that law-abiding Jews will continue to cooperate with the authorities so that local order can be restored as soon as possible. The American authorities were notified before taking action, but their opinions were not sought, because maintaining law and order is a responsibility that Britain shouldered under the mandate, and there is no need to seek the consent of other countries. As for the recommendations of the Anglo-American investigation team, experts from both countries are still discussing the details. After Attlee's statement was released, Members of Parliament questioned him harshly, demanding that the government publish evidence of the Jewish Agency's support for terrorists. The government stated that the publication of evidence must wait because the action is still ongoing. According to this reporter's observation, the reason why the terrorist actions in Palestine have lasted so long is undoubtedly due to the protection and assistance provided by the Jewish Agency. The British action of attacking the headquarters of the Jewish Agency and its affiliated armed forces, the Haganah, with lightning speed, was motivated by the desire to eliminate the root causes of terrorist actions in one fell swoop. But the question is, what will be the effectiveness? According to the broadcast of the Jewish secret radio station in Palestine (which has not yet been cracked), they will take retaliatory actions. According to the leaders of the Jewish Agency who have not been arrested, Jews cannot cooperate with the authorities while some executive committee members are still detained. Therefore, the tense situation in Palestine is unlikely to ease in the short term, and the hope of ending terrorist actions is even more remote, and may even cause more violent new terrorist actions. This of course awaits the development of the situation, and we do not want to make predictions. However, in any case, this is a new turning point in the evolution of the Palestine dispute, making it even more difficult for Britain to compromise with the Jews in the future, which is undoubtedly true. Therefore, we may as well analyze the significance of this action a little more. We know that the current situation in Palestine is the result of the First World War, which was assigned to Britain by the League of Nations under mandate. When the British army had already occupied this land, and the intention of the Jews had been decided, Britain issued the so-called

Balfour Declaration

saying that the British government wanted to "prepare a national home" for the Jews in Palestine, but without prejudice to the inherent welfare of the local Arabs and the Jews scattered around the world. The purpose of this declaration was to win the sympathy of the world so that Britain could continue to manage this land, and it later got its wish. The Balfour Declaration was also recognized and adopted by the San Remo Conference in 1920 and the mandate agreement in 1923, and became the legal policy for Britain to govern this land. The mass immigration of Jews can be said to have started at this time, especially in recent years, as a result of the expulsion of Jews from all over the world, even more Jews have immigrated. At present, Palestine has about 1.2 million Arabs and about 600,000 Jews. However, because the Jews have more financial and intellectual resources than the Arabs, it is inevitable that the Jews will win in the competition between the two sides. The friction between the two sides has become increasingly acute due to the increasing number of Jews immigrating. The British authorities vacillated between the two sides, sometimes favoring the Jews and sometimes favoring the Arabs, depending on the general situation and British interests. Recently, due to the development of Arab national consciousness and the strengthening of mutual unity, the resistance to the continued immigration of Jews to Palestine has gradually intensified. In view of this, Britain has restricted the annual number of Jewish immigrants since 1939 and restricted the Jews who have already immigrated from purchasing land in certain areas. In this way, although the resistance of the Arabs has become silent, the resistance of the Jews has risen one after another, and the dispute has never been quiet. Last November, British Foreign Secretary Bevin announced the organization of

### Unprecedented Drug Den Uncovered: Confiscated Drugs Valued at Approximately 300 Million Yuan; More Than 30 People Arrested in Several Locations, Including Six "Special" Engineers

[Report from this Newspaper] Song Tingjun, Chief of the Taishan Police Station Branch, received a tip-off the night before last that someone was selling large quantities of drugs, and immediately began investigating. That night, he went with Deputy Chief Li, Section Chief Zhang, and others to the home of Zhu Guangming (30 years old, from Shandong) at No. 5, Lane 279, Ninghai East Road, and found multiple bags of morphine raw materials in the middle of flour sacks. He took Zhu to the station for questioning. According to his confession, the morphine belonged to his friend Li Shisen (43 years old, from Ningbo, residing at No. 53, Hongrui Lane, Xinwen Road), who and Li had worked together as morphine engineers. He then took the suspect to Li's address and arrested him. According to Li's confession, he had indeed worked as an engineer, and said that there were accomplices who often visited the Dieji and Jindi salted meat shops on Taoyuan Road to solicit prostitutes. Officers were dispatched to arrest them but were unsuccessful. Li also confessed that No. 659, at the intersection of Daxilu and Yidingpan Road, was a major drug den. Chief Song personally led Section Chief Zhang and officers Zhang Jiabao, Yang Xinzhong, Police Chief Huang Peiting, Yu Yan, plainclothes police Xu Xuebo, Deng Kexiang, Gao Wenrong, Hao Wende, Xu Yushi, Wu Youkai, Xie Jianqing, Liu Dengdi, Yang Jinhong and others to the above-mentioned location overnight. They saw a sign for the Da Zhong Coal Ball Factory hanging at the entrance. Inside was set up the Guangming Chemical Industry Company. They found two people boiling raw materials downstairs. Upon reaching the second floor, they saw two people packing bags. They immediately arrested foreman Li Junan (34 years old, from Suzhou, residing at No. 18, Baoshan Road), Wang Jingui (41 years old, from Ningbo, residing at No. 161, Yangzhou Road), Wang Zhangdong (50 years old, from Jinhua, residing at No. 223, Changping Road), and Guo Xingquan (26 years old, from Suzhou, who had been in the gauze belt business and residing at No. 12, Minguo Lane, Minguo Road). It was learned that the above four people were all drug manufacturing engineers. Subsequently, the landlord and accountant of both the Da Zhong and Guangming companies, Lin Chuntao (29 years old, local), was arrested. It was learned that he was one of the drug manufacturing shareholders. Another suspect, Zhang Anfa, was an employee of the Guangming Chemical Industry Company (41 years old, from Ningbo). According to Li Junan's confession, the boss was Cai Yangen (37 years old, from Shaoxing, residing at No. 18, Jincheng Villa, Jing'an Temple Road). Li was taken there, and in addition to arresting the suspect Zhu, they found a privately owned pistol with a license and confiscated a bag of heroin. According to Zhu's confession, they arrested shareholder Zhu Chunyuan (36 years old, from Hubei, engaged in the silk business) at No. 25, Shuntian Village, Chengdu Road. The above ten people were all principal offenders. They went to various places and arrested more than 20 male and female accomplices one after another, and all were taken to the station, where Chief Song, together with Section Chief Zhang, conducted separate and thorough interrogations. In the drug den on Daxi Road, a total of six large boxes of drugs were found (one of which was unfinished), each box weighing over 30 taels (with lime underneath), as well as machinery, raw materials, and four boxes of kerosene, five large glass bottles, sixteen large foreign bottles, a roll of cotton, a porcelain cylinder, a grinding cylinder, two lead buckets, two lead pots, one hemp bag of pure alkali, another rush bag, measuring scales and other items, two washbasins, a large charcoal brazier, and a funnel, all of which were taken back to the branch for filing. The confiscated drugs are estimated to be worth over 300 million yuan. The capital of the drug den was huge, the scale was grand, and it was rarely seen in recent years. It is reported that there are still several principal and accessory offenders at large, and the branch is pursuing them.

### Tide Rises to 14 Feet 8 Inches: River Water Floods the Middle of the Road; Huangpu Bund a Vast Expanse; Impossible to Distinguish Shore from River

[Report from this Newspaper] These past few days, we have been experiencing spring tides. At midnight yesterday, in the area of the Bund on Linsen Road, the Huangpu River flooded the road. Standing nearby, one could only see a vast expanse of water, unable to distinguish the shore from the river. The French Consulate seemed to be built in the ocean. The Daming Road area was also flooded, especially the area east of Yuanfang Road and west of Tilanqiao. The wharves floated on the river, higher than the land. The small boats parked on the beach seemed to be parked on the road. In the low-lying areas of the city, the tide poured back into the sewers, just like a flood!

According to the Junpu Bureau report: Yesterday's tide reached 14 feet 8 inches, so the river flooding was inevitable. Because the terrain of Shanghai is relatively low, and with the help of the northeast wind, the tide surged towards Shanghai.

Usually June-July to August-September is the spring tide season of the year (lunar calendar), so this year's spring tide will not pass for a while. The phenomenon of low-lying areas being flooded will continue for a considerable period of time.

### Report on Restoration of Curfew is Inaccurate

[Report from this Newspaper] Rumors were circulating that the security authorities would restore the curfew from August 1st.

It was stated that there was no such thing. The current security situation in Shanghai is quite stable, and there is no need to restore the curfew.

### Shenchang Labor-Management Dispute: Mayor to Give Instructions Today

[Report from this Newspaper] The workers of the machine manufacturing factory of the American-owned Shenchang Foreign Firm submitted a request to the employer a month ago to adjust their wages and adopt the cost of living index for salary payment. The employer believes that the cost of manufactured products is higher than that of imported products, and that there have been huge losses for several months. They are willing to close down part of the manufacturing factory, otherwise, they will have to reduce wages to reduce the cost of manufactured products to maintain operations. The labor side felt that their demands were not met and that there was a risk of unemployment, so they traveled around appealing for support. This reporter visited Zhao Banfu, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, yesterday. According to him, the factory is indeed suffering huge losses. Mayor Wu is now working hard to resolve this dispute, on the one hand persuading the employer to abandon the proposal to close down, and on the other hand persuading the labor side to make some concessions on wages. It is also heard that Mayor Wu will personally go to the Shenchang Factory on Yangshupu Road at 3:00 PM today to give instructions to all the workers in order to break the deadlock that has lasted for a month.

### He DeKui States "Busy with Official Duties"; No Time to "Argue" with Luo Heng; Mayor Wu Remains Silent on the He Case

[Report from this Newspaper] After Luo Heng, a councilor who came to Shanghai a few days ago, published a conversation in the newspaper exposing He DeKui, reporters from this city rushed to the City Hall to interview Secretary-General He yesterday. He did not give a definitive answer to the reporters' questions. According to people in the Secretary-General's office, He is waiting for a thorough investigation and has no intention of resigning at present. His trip to Beijing a few days ago was at the call of President Song. The photographic evidence presented by Luo Heng is indeed true, but the situation at the time was chaotic and the environment was bad. He's signed letter to the Bureau of Education of the Public Concession was intended to allow the puppet education committee to contact the Bureau of Education and fill out the forms issued by the puppet government to avoid trouble with the authorities of the Public Concession. Moreover, the sphere of influence of the Bureau of Education of the Public Concession was the schools of the Public Concession, not the schools of the entire city. The letter did not contain any instructions to change to puppet textbooks, and puppet textbooks had not yet been printed at that time. People around He also said that when He took office as Deputy Mayor of Shanghai, he was summoned to meet with Chairman Chiang, and he immediately expressed that he had worked in the Public Concession under foreign rule for many years. Once he took office as Deputy Mayor of Shanghai, he might not be able to meet the expectations of the public. The chairman encouraged him to work with peace of mind.

According to Da Guang News Agency: It is heard that before He went to Beijing last Saturday to see President Song, he went to see Chiang Bocheng, who stayed in Shanghai during the War of Resistance to preside over underground work, asking him to send a telegram to the chairman to prove that he was protecting underground workers. Therefore, it is generally speculated that He's trips to Beijing and Shanghai were to find strong counter-evidence. Luo Heng, the councilor who first exposed He, came to Shanghai from Beijing a few days ago, met with reporters, and published the motives and process of the exposure, citing two strong pieces of evidence: (1) Promoting enslavement education, (2) Monitoring the activities of teachers, and refuting He's previous statement that he did not leave because the British and Americans in the Public Concession all stayed in their posts after the outbreak of the Pacific War, saying that He had probably forgotten which country he himself belonged to. Reporters from various newspapers visited He at the City Hall yesterday, asking for his opinion on Luo's remarks. He replied: "Facts speak louder than words. I have a clear conscience. I will continue to work as usual and wait for the government to send someone to investigate thoroughly. The truth will come out in the future." At this point, He suddenly left his seat, seemingly impatient to talk more, and then lingered in front of the long table where the reporters were sitting, talking about his trip to Beijing, saying that he had not been to the capital for more than ten years. In Beijing, in addition to visiting President Song, he also went to Zijin Mountain to pay homage to the mausoleum and admire the remains of the Founding Father, respectfully presenting wreaths to express his respect. Finally, he said that he was busy with official duties and really had no time to "argue" with Ms. Luo Heng.

A Datong News Agency reporter asked Mayor Wu yesterday whether He's written reply to the accusations of being a traitor after Secretary-General He was accused of being a traitor had been forwarded to the central government. Mayor Wu replied that it had already been forwarded to the Executive Yuan and stated that He's case was completely a ordinary judicial case and he did not want to respond to it, because Secretary-General He served in the City Hall before him. This incident was a past event, and Secretary-General He is an incumbent administrative official. To date, there has been no one who has made a formal or anonymous accusation, so he would not express his opinion until he received an order from the central government.

### The Coal Ball King: Shen Jinzhou's Public Trial. Differing Views among Peers, Joint Accusations of Collaborating with the Enemy, While Others Guarantee Innocence. Roughly One Hundred Firms on Each Side, Showing Equally Strong Support. The Defendant Claims to Have Received a Letter of Thanks from Former Mayor Qian Dajun.

[Report from this Newspaper] Shen Jinzhou, the manager of Shanghai's largest coal merchant, Yi Tai Xing Coal Company Limited, was tried yesterday afternoon at the High Court on suspicion of being a traitor. Shen, who is 60 years old and a native of Yuyao, Zhejiang, is known in Shanghai as the "Coal Ball King." After the victory, he was jointly accused by over a hundred coal merchants in the city on three counts: (1) Yi Tai Xing Coal Company was originally a shareholder of the Huashang Liujiang Coal Mine Railway Company Limited. In November of the 26th year (1937), Shen colluded with Zhu Yicai, the chairman of the company, to sell all the mineral rights, mineral products, railways, and other assets of the Liujiang Coal Mine area in Linjian County, Hebei Province, to the enemy merchant Mitsui & Co. at a huge price. (2) After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the source of Shanghai's coal fell entirely into the hands of the enemy. All coal was managed and operated under the control of the Coal Association organized by Japanese companies such as Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Yamashita, and Kailuan. Shen, along with sixteen other merchants including Da Chang, raised funds to organize the Da Zhong Lian Coal Company. Shen was elected as chairman and requested to purchase coal from the Coal Association, implementing the enemy's control policies on their behalf, seeking exorbitant profits, and harming the people's livelihood. In the 33rd year (1944), the coal company was reorganized into the Da Zhong Lian Coal Rationing Office, and Shen was again elected as a standing director. (3) From January of the 34th year (1945), due to the enemy's defeat in the Pacific War and the lack of shipping, Da Zhong Lian used civilian ships to transport coal from Qingdao to Shanghai, half of which was supplied to the enemy army and half of which was sold on the market for profit. Following this accusation, the High Prosecutor's Office detained Shen, and after the investigation was completed, formally filed a public prosecution.

Shen appeared yesterday wearing white silk shirt and trousers, covered with a long blue-gray silk robe, a flat-topped hat, black shoes, and a white folding fan in his hand. He spoke in pure local dialect, answering that after the "September 18th Incident," the Liujiang Mine was occupied by enemy forces. Zhu Yicai had repeatedly negotiated without result, until ten years later, when the shareholders' meeting resolved to authorize the board of directors to negotiate with the enemy. However, the enemy refused to return the mine and only agreed to pay a price of 600,000 yuan. Regarding the Da Zhong Lian Coal Company, it was not an enemy puppet organization or group, but a partnership funded by private individuals, and had nothing to do with the Japanese. Furthermore, he had repeatedly declined the position of chairman. After the reorganization into the Rationing Office in the 33rd year (1944), he never attended meetings. Therefore, regarding the third accusation of transporting coal to Qingdao, he had resigned and knew nothing about it. After the victory, he was entrusted by Zhao Zengyu, the director of the Shanghai Public Utilities Bureau, to take over the "Coal Association," obtaining more than 50,000 tons of coal for the city's power company. He claimed that a letter of thanks from Mayor Qian Dajun could prove this. The court then summoned the accusers, Tong Zixin and Luo Xinqing, who stated that they were in the same industry as the defendant and had no personal grudges. This accusation was made from a public and righteous standpoint because the defendant had relied on enemy power to control all the coal in Shanghai, prohibiting free trade, exploiting peers, and harming the people's livelihood. Therefore, after the victory, more than one hundred peers jointly accused him.

The defendant's defense lawyers, Jiang Yiping and Xu Zuoliang, also stood up and eloquently argued that while more than one hundred peers had signed and sealed the accusation, the defendant also had over one hundred peers who had jointly guaranteed that the defendant had committed no criminal acts. They also pointed out that the seals on the seams of the joint accusation letter were connected, which was highly suspicious, and asked the court to pay attention to this point. They also presented many evidentiary documents that were favorable to the defendant.

Yesterday, while Shen testified in court, he held a folding fan, gesturing east and west, and repeatedly said "Amitabha," "My sins," and "Heaven knows." When he spoke with indignation, his face turned red, and he often patted his chest, as if overwhelmed with grief. After the hearing, the court ordered a postponement for further questioning. He held the fan in both hands and bowed to the court, saying, "Thank you, my lords," "Thank you, my lords." After briefly talking to his family and friends, he was escorted back to prison by the bailiffs.

Zhang Yipu, Sun Zuji

On the same day, the case of Zhang Yipu was tried. Zhang was the chief of the telegraph section of the puppet Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In September of the 30th year (1941), he was transferred to be the director of the puppet Military Commission's Radio Telegraph Main Station. The station had one 150-watt machine and three 50-watt machines, which were exclusively used to send telegrams for the puppet Military Commission's subordinate puppet troops and senior officials of the puppet government. Branch stations were set up in all important areas, totaling over one hundred. All the radio operators were mostly graduates from the Nanyang Radio School, which was run by the defendant himself. After questioning, the court ordered him to be held for further questioning.

In addition, the case of Sun Zuji, the puppet mayor of Hangzhou, was also adjourned for further questioning after witnesses were questioned.

Shen Fenggang, Indicted

[Report from this Newspaper] Shen Fenggang, the director of the Fourth Division of the "76th" Puppet Secret Service Headquarters, was arrested by our military authorities after the victory and transferred to the court. Recently, the High Prosecutor's Office completed the investigation and formally filed a public prosecution. In addition, Wang Yanfu was also indicted on suspicion of being a traitor.

The cases of Wu Song and Guan Yifeng were also concluded on the same day, and both were scheduled for sentencing at 9:30 AM on August 6th. Wu had previously served as the director of the International Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government and a legal specialist for the Chinese delegation to the League of Nations before the war. In May of the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), he joined the puppet government and successively served as a member of the Committee for the Abolition of Extraterritoriality of the Puppet Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the director of the First District Office of the Puppet Shanghai Municipality, and the secretary-general of the Puppet Shanghai Municipal Government. In February of the 34th year (1945), he was promoted to the Minister of Puppet Judicial Administration, until the victory. During the debate yesterday, Wu wore a gray silk robe, deep glasses, and his hair was gray, showing his old age. Standing in the defendant's dock with a paper fan in his hand, he stated that during his tenure as the Minister of Puppet Judicial Administration, he had issued an amnesty decree, as a result of which more than 700 prisoners were released. As for the "Greater East Asia War Commemoration Meeting" and other speeches published in the newspapers during his tenure as the Secretary-General of the Puppet Shanghai Municipal Government, it was because the puppet mayor Chen Gongbo was not in Shanghai, so he represented him, but the draft was written by the puppet propaganda department, which was just a formality. Yu Chuanmin, Zhu Yigui, Gu Wang Yingxia, and others were also summoned to testify in court, proving that the defendant had rescued underground workers and other matters.

### Four Steps Formulated to Organize and Manage the City's Twenty-Four Small Vegetable Markets

[Report from this Newspaper] Every morning, Shanghai's twenty-four small vegetable markets are the most noisy, dirty, and chaotic places. How to make them tidy, clean, and orderly is indeed an urgent task. According to Section Chief Ling of the Health Bureau, who spoke to reporters yesterday, the Health Bureau has now formulated four steps to organize and manage the vegetable markets: (1) Issuing stallholder licenses, which has already been largely completed. (2) Adjusting stalls: In the past, the stalls in the vegetable markets were arranged in a haphazard and disorderly manner. According to the plan, they will be arranged by category. For example, fish, meat, and vegetables will all be gathered in one place, which will be much more convenient for buyers. More than ten vegetable markets, including those on North Sichuan Road and Hongkou Triangle, have already been organized according to the plan, with only four or five places, such as Zhoushan Road and Seymour Road, yet to be implemented. (3) Banning open-air vegetable markets outside the markets: Setting up stalls in the open air along the road is most likely to obstruct traffic, and the dust is also detrimental to hygiene, so it is necessary to strictly ban them. However, the difficulty lies in the fact that there are many refugees and unemployed people in society today, and it is quite difficult to ban them all at once. (4) Banning miscellaneous goods stalls inside the markets: Many vegetable markets have many stallholders who do not fall within the scope of "small vegetables," such as those selling bamboo products and scraps of cloth. The largest number of miscellaneous stalls are general snack stalls. According to the vegetable market reorganization plan, they are all subject to banning. There are two ways to ban them: (1) Order these miscellaneous stalls to automatically convert to other small vegetable stalls. (2) Otherwise, order them to move out. The implementation methods are currently being discussed with the relevant police stations. Section Chief Ling also said that the current rent for vegetable market stallholders is only 600 yuan per month, while the monthly management fee for each vegetable market is as high as 200,000 to 300,000 yuan, which is a huge deficit. Therefore, the vegetable market management fee is currently one of the municipal government's business expenses, purely for the purpose of serving the citizens.

However, it is understood that the military authorities believe that there is no need for an interrogation. As for the rumor that Yang Xizhi had surrendered to the Garrison Headquarters, the reporter inquired separately from the grain administration and the Garrison Headquarters yesterday, but both were unable to confirm it.

Regarding the account books of the grain loan merchants, the District Prosecutor's Office has designated Yuan Jitang, Chen Derong, Liu Wei'an, and Xu Wennu, all professors and accountants from the accounting department of Fudan University, to examine the relevant account books of the grain merchants in the grain loan case. It has been more than ten days, and it is understood that the internal situation is very complicated, and it will take about another week to complete the examination and report.

### The Scout Movement Has Lost Its Soul

A Discussion with Scout Founder Yan Jialin

[Central News Agency, Hankou, 30th] This reporter encountered Yan Jialin, the founder of the Scout movement, at the Deming Hotel yesterday. According to him: The Scout movement is essentially basic civic education and also character education. The twelve Scout laws, for example, contain the norms for training a noble citizen. Technical training, on the other hand, is secondary. Today, the Scout movement is gradually declining, focusing solely on formal exercises and forgetting the original meaning. It can be said that the current Scout movement has lost its soul, only the form remains, and it has become a kind of embellishment in school education, used as decoration, and as a tool for welcoming and sending off. Finally, he solemnly stated that society often confuses the Scout movement with physical education. This misconception must be corrected. Scout training emphasizes moral, intellectual, and physical education equally, while physical education only emphasizes physical training, just as bricklayers and carpenters are both needed for construction, but bricklayers cannot also be carpenters.

### Each District Office Should Establish a Mediation Committee; Ministry of Interior Sends Official Letter to the City Government for Consideration and Implementation

The Ministry of Interior yesterday sent an official letter to the Municipal Government stating: "Following the end of the war and the beginning of reconstruction, disputes of various civil and criminal natures, such as those involving land, debt, and marriage, are bound to increase. To reduce litigation and save manpower and resources, each district office should be supervised to establish a mediation committee according to the regulations on the organization of township mediation committees. These committees should earnestly handle civil and criminal mediation matters. Prior to this, fair-minded individuals with legal knowledge within each district should be encouraged to be selected as mediation committee members. The municipal government, in conjunction with the court, should convene these members for a short training course to facilitate implementation and comply with official regulations."

Twenty-Ninth and Thirtieth Districts Adjust Areas

The case of adjusting the areas of the 29th, 30th, and 31st districts of Pudong was decided by the Municipal Government in March of this year. The old Yangsi and Tangqiao districts were incorporated into the 29th district, Yangjing and Luxing districts into the 30th district, and Gaohang and Gaoqiao into the 31st district. The police bureau had already complied with the order to adjust its divisions to align with the administrative changes. However, due to delays caused by the Senatorial elections, the adjustments have not yet been implemented. The Civil Affairs Bureau convened the district chiefs of the respective districts on the 26th to complete handover procedures. The 30th district should transfer nine "bao" (neighborhood) units of Tangqiao district to the jurisdiction of the 29th district. Both parties have agreed to complete the handover by August 1st.

Senator Resigns Concurrent Position. Chen Bingguo, a senator from the 29th district, was originally a representative of the 11th "bao" of that district. In accordance with municipal regulations prohibiting senators from concurrently holding the position of district representative, he has resigned his position as district representative, and Li Xuejiang has been appointed as the successor district representative.

Neighborhood Chief Work Conference. The 9th District Office convened a work conference on the 28th for the neighborhood chiefs under its jurisdiction. Detailed discussions were held on issues such as census taking, promotion of national education, public security, and sanitation.

Preparing to Establish a Cooperative Branch. The 9th District Office convened neighborhood chiefs and district representatives on the 28th and appointed preparatory committee members for a cooperative. It was decided to establish a branch of the Shanghai Cooperative Society in the 9th district, and 23 individuals, including the neighborhood chiefs, were appointed as preparatory committee members.

Thirty-First District Dredges Rivers and Builds Roads

Representatives from the Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau, Hu Renzheng; the Education Bureau, Zhou Dengdao; and social education expert Yu Qingtan attended to provide guidance. It was resolved to first establish six civil schools and raise funds with a target of 10 million yuan, with neighborhood chiefs and local gentry responsible for soliciting donations throughout the district.

### Question and Answer Session

The Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau recently responded to Mr. You Tang's question: "How can a person who lives in a hotel obtain household registration?"

"Upon investigation, this case was previously referred to the Ministry of Interior for clarification, which was granted as follows: (1) People moving in from other counties or cities, who intend to reside for an extended period but do not have a fixed residence, and who have lived in a hotel for more than one month, should be registered for household registration in accordance with the amended household registration law. If the party concerned is unwilling to register for household registration, they should be registered for relocation. (2) Residents of this city who have returned to their hometowns after the war and are temporarily staying in hotels should be registered for household registration. (3) After the above two types of people are registered for household registration, they must register a change of address when their place of residence is confirmed. If you intend to reside for an extended period, you can follow the above regulations and apply to the security office in your area to complete the procedures for household registration or relocation."

Questions and Answers on Household Registration Laws and Regulations

(5) Question: Regarding inquiries about age, people's answers are mostly untrue. How can accuracy be ensured?

Answer: First ask the age, then ask the zodiac sign of birth, then the year number of birth, and finally the animal sign. Then check the 120-year age, zodiac year number, and animal sign table, and the lunar and solar calendar comparison table. The four should be cross-verified to ensure accurate age. If the family has a birth record book, the age should be determined accordingly.

(6) Question: When inquiring about age and date of birth, many people answer using the lunar calendar. If the Gregorian calendar is mistakenly used, there will be many errors and the person may be unable to answer. How should this be remedied?

Answer: You can ask for the lunar calendar for verification, and then refer to the actual age conversion table attached to the supplementary explanation for filling out the form promulgated and revised by this department on July 27, 1943, to determine their age and date of birth.

(7) Question: In the same household registration area, the son of A and the daughter of B, both with the same original domicile, are both widowed and have been cohabiting for years. They have two children together, and each has parents living with them who are being supported. In society, they are already regarded as a family. According to the definition of "family" in the household registration law, this type of cohabiting person and their parents and children, who live together and share a common life, should be registered as one family for household registration purposes. However, how should the relationship of each person be filled in on the application form?

Answer: For those who have formed a family through cohabitation, the relationship of the people involved in the application form should be filled in as "cohabiting family members" for the cohabiting parties. The children born from the cohabitation should be regarded as children born in wedlock according to Article 1065 of the Civil Code, and all others should be filled in as "related family members."

(8) Question: What surname should illegitimate children use?

Answer: Illegitimate children, that is, children born out of wedlock according to the Civil Code, whose parents cannot be determined, are considered abandoned children in household registration. Article 58, Section 2, of the Household Registration Law originally stipulated that the director of household registration should give them a surname and name. This should be considered based on the situation at the time, without the need for separate standards. If the abandoned child has been adopted, the surname should be that of the adoptive parent according to Article 1078 of the Civil Code, and the application for registration of birth should be processed according to the usual procedures. In addition, if the birth mother of a child born out of wedlock marries, the child should take the mother's surname according to Article 1065, Section 2 of the Civil Code.

New Household Registration Law Explained, Written by Yu Si Jin, Published Yesterday

Yu Sijin, an official of the Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau, believes that the Household Registration Law and its implementation rules are both concise and profound. To promote a widespread understanding and implementation, it is necessary to elaborate and explain them in detail. Therefore, in his spare time, based on his daily study of household administration and his practical experience in household administration, he has compiled the book "New Household Registration Law Explained." The explanations are detailed and the reference materials are abundant. It was published yesterday, and the price is 1,200 yuan per copy.

### Dyeing and Weaving Industry Operates at Less Than 30% Capacity; Dye Prices Plummet; Only Indanthrene Blue Still Popular

[Reported by this newspaper] May and June are normally slow months, but due to high interest rates and economic difficulties in rural areas, the dyeing and weaving industry is experiencing increasing difficulties. According to sources in the industry's core, current operations are at less than 30% capacity. As a result, the trend for raw materials is weak. Even vulcanized dyes, which have been the most popular in recent months, are declining. American BG yuan is currently selling for 9.23 million, but there are few buyers, a decrease of more than 100,000 compared to a month ago. However, 693 yuan is still standing at the 1.2 million yuan mark because the brand has already been sold. The price was the same a month ago, which is commendable. According to sources from importers, there have been considerable arrivals of vulcanized dyes and alkaline dyes, which is making people more nervous and sales more sluggish. Alkaline dyes were priced at around 50,000 yuan in May and June, but now 35,000 yuan is hardly attracting buyers. It is said that orders from companies such as Meihe Yanghang will be released in large quantities soon, so the price drop is inevitable. However, people in the raw material industry say that if the price drops further, no one will be willing to sell because the cost plus taxes and transportation is not small. The example of insurance powder is a good example of this. Insurance powder was priced at 370,000 to 380,000 yuan in March and April. Later, due to strong orders, no one dared to buy even at 130,000 yuan. In the end, due to cost factors, the price could not be reduced further, and recently it has rebounded slightly. Caustic soda is still being sold through American Yue brand, priced at 500,000 yuan. The delivery of goods by Bui Nei Men is stable, and the selling price can still be maintained, but it has fallen by more than 100,000 yuan compared to a month ago. Indanthrene Blue can be described as the darling of dyes at the moment. Although the market for dyeing factories is narrow, the stock of Defu Yanghang is almost exhausted. Some even claim that there are only about 20 barrels left, which can only produce 20,000 bolts of cloth. Scarcity drives up the price, so the price is uniquely high, currently around 18 million yuan, almost double what it was a month ago. What is strange is that the American Bausch & Lomb Blue, which competes with it, has not arrived for a long time, so the less there is of it, the higher the price. Other dyes and raw materials are beyond reach. In terms of the situation of dyeing factories, there is a shortage of both capital and inventory. Therefore, when there are more arrivals, the price falls due to the small purchasing power, and when the goods are out of stock, the price rises due to the thinness of the inventory.

### Morale is Low; Speculation is High; Gold Prices Continue to Fall; US Dollars Also Drop by 30 Yuan

According to reports, a large amount of Mexican gold is being shipped to Hong Kong, which may flow into China. However, due to the ban on gold exports in Hong Kong, morale is low, but low prices can still be supported. In the early morning, it fell from 1.895 million to 1.885 million. There was some speculation, but at low prices, money changers absorbed some of it, so there was not much change. The central government allocated 60 bars at a price of 1.89 million. After 10 o'clock, securities fell, and idle funds purchased some, which briefly rose to around 1.9 million. At noon, it still hovered around 1.89 million. In the afternoon, it continued to decline, and finally there was a low price. Guang Bang sold, and as a result, the closing price fell another 27,000 compared to the previous day. Gold jewelry was reduced to 1 million yuan. Silver ingots and silver dollars were not changed. Secret interest rates were stable, and interest rates remained the same.

Foreign exchange US dollars are boring. Yesterday the market was still short. In the early morning, it was between 2,480 yuan and 2,490 yuan. It briefly rose to above 2,500 yuan in the middle, but it was still around 2,490 yuan at noon. Scrutiny has become more severe, and idle funds are afraid and dare not move, so there is no way to revitalize it. In the afternoon, the gold market weakened again, and it was brought down to a low price at the close. As a result, it fell by 30 yuan compared to the previous close. Hong Kong bills were calm and unchanged. Hong Kong dollars fell slightly. There was trading around 550 yuan. Indian exchange was sold at 668 yuan. British exchange was sold at 8,900 yuan, but they could not be maintained. US exchange trading was still rare.

Government Bonds Continue to Fall

Government bonds fell again, and transactions decreased again. Series C bonds fell from 700 yuan to 680 yuan. They hovered in this range from the opening and remained unchanged. As a result, they fell by 50 yuan compared to the previous close. Series A and B were the same. Series D fell by 30 yuan, and Series E also fell by 40 yuan.

### Silk Still Shows No Improvement

Yesterday, rayon fell across the board. No. 120 Tianqiao Youguang opened at 1.56 million yuan. The lowest traded was 550,000 yuan. There were not a few who absorbed it at low prices. The closing price recovered to a high of 570,000 yuan, which was 30,000 yuan less than the previous day. Other brands of goods were reduced by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Factory processed goods were favored. Meiya bed coverings and Dacheng checkered crepe were good. Huajin crepe fell another 20 yuan yesterday. The worst was only 1,900 yuan.

### Newspaper Price Increase

Due to the Appreciation of Canadian and Swedish Currencies

[Reuters, London, 30th] World newspaper prices will automatically increase due to the appreciation of the Canadian and Swedish currencies against the US dollar, as Canada and Sweden are the world's largest exporters of newspaper, it is said.

### News of US Stock Donations is Incorrect; Speculative Sentiment in Chinese Stocks is Frustrated

Chinese stocks were affected yesterday by the news that the US donation of stocks in Meiya had been confirmed by the company's shareholders to be incorrect. People were disturbed. Except for Yongsha, which could still be supported as a speculative target, the rest were affected and fell. Meiya was the most cowardly and tired, breaking the 4,000 yuan mark. It was still flickering in the middle, going from high to low. In the end, it was still relatively stable. Yongsha high price 680 yuan, Meiya 4,330 yuan, Jingfu 250 yuan, Xinguang 245 yuan, Qinxing 188 yuan, low price Shuisha 652 yuan, Meiya 3,930 yuan, Jingfu 233 yuan, Xinguang 228 yuan, Qinxing 165 yuan, and then the market turned. As a result, Yongsha He fell by 15 yuan, Meiya fell by 310 yuan, Jingfu fell by 10 yuan, Xinguang fell by 8 yuan, Qinxing fell by only 3 yuan, because the price was low and some people maintained it. The small and medium-sized stocks, which were relatively cold, also fell slightly. The old stocks were stable.

Foreign stocks gradually stabilized. It was difficult to continue to liquidate. Fatigue was seen in the middle, but it was short-lived and soon rebounded. Yisha fell from 8,900 yuan to 8,500 yuan. In the end, it struggled at the closing price of the previous day. As a result, Steel, Paper, and Huidong were slightly higher than the previous close. Yinglian Yisha Yipie, Guanghang Industry were stable and unchanged.

### Improving American Cotton; Seven Goals; Actively Promoting

Some of these points will be strengthened in the Tennessee Mechanical Cotton Production Experiment Field, which is under the direction of the Southwest Development Bureau, this year.

Raw Sugar Continues to Soften

Yesterday's sugar market was stable because there was not much white sugar on the upper end. Raw sugar was weak because the next batch was arriving. The public association opened the Chongti Qing price at 88,000 yuan, and Huanggang Qing at 86,000 yuan, down 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. There were less than 100 packages traded. Xinghua helped to sell more than 60 baskets of ordinary red at 113,000 to 114,000 yuan.

### Middle and Lower Rice Sales are Rare; Oil Market Has Not Recovered

Yesterday, more than 7,000 stones of rice arrived in the North and South markets. There were slight transactions in high-quality white japonica rice. The middle and lower quality rice remained sluggish. Indica rice digestion was light, and the middle and lower quality rice fell by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. More and more white yuan rice arrived, and the market weakened. Sales were not good. Flour transactions continued, and the price rose by 400 to 500 yuan. However, the market was slightly tired at the close. There was a shortage of wheat shipping space, and customers were not happy, so the price fell by 400 to 500 yuan. Bran sales were active in rural areas, and the price rose by 200 to 300 yuan. Soybean arrivals and sales were even, and the market fluctuated. The middle and lower oil mills were less willing to buy, and the price fell by 400 to 500 yuan. High-quality mung beans rose by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Sales were more active than yesterday, but there were still few transactions in the middle and lower quality. Raw peanuts digested and dropped by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan.

### Social Affairs Bureau Will Find a Way to Suppress the City's Oil Prices

The price of cooking oil has soared in recent days, and there is still no market. The Social Affairs Bureau is paying close attention to this matter. Director Wu Kaixian sent a special letter to Vice Minister Xiao Zheng of the Ministry of Economic Affairs the night before (29th), forwarding it to Minister Wang, requesting the two major oil factories under the ministry, Zhongzhi and Zhongshi, to cooperate with the bureau to suppress the city's oil prices. Xiao has agreed to convey the message. Wu told people yesterday that the soaring prices of cooking oil in the city in recent days are extremely unreasonable. In order to safeguard the interests of the citizens, I have decided to take action. In the past two days, I have sent Ji Kewei to the Zhongzhi factory to discuss with the manufacturer how to suppress the price of oil. According to various investigations, the city's cooking oil inventory is still sufficient, and the inventory can meet the needs of three months. As for the rumors that there are few arrivals from Qingdao, the situation is not serious. The city's cooking oil source is dependent on Changzhou and Wuxi, accounting for 30%. Qingpu, Songjiang, and Shanghai local production accounts for 30%. Bengbu accounts for 10%. Qingdao and northern Jiangsu account for only 30%. Moreover, Qingdao cooking oil is still being shipped to Shanghai, so there is no shortage of sources.

### 850 Rice Shops Apply to Distribute Unpolished Rice by District

The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau instructed the Bean and Rice Industry Association to register for the purpose of distributing unpolished rice universally. As of today, 850 rice shops have applied. Each rice shop must be jointly guaranteed by three shops and preliminarily approved by the Industry Association before submitting it to the Social Affairs Bureau for approval. First-class rice shops are allocated 20 bags of rice each time, and second-class rice shops are allocated 10 bags of rice each time. The city is divided into 26 districts. Once the authorities have completed the review, the rice can be distributed and sold at a flat price in sequence. According to the person in charge of the bureau, the current inventory of Sichuan and Jiangxi rice is very abundant. The first batch of 72,170 bags has already arrived in port, and the second batch of 70,000 bags of foreign rice will also be shipped in the next few days. The registered rice merchants will gradually sell it at a flat price. The citizens' food supply should not be a concern in the next two months.

### New Water Tung Branches are Seen

The new goods of this year's Water Tung branches have been delayed due to the lack of direct shipping to Shanghai. Now a batch has been shipped from Guangdong. It was heard that the North Market has already opened, and the first batch is not more than 130,000 yuan.

### Yarn and Printed Cloth Remain Sluggish

Yesterday's flower market started with fatigue. In the early morning, Shuangma was still stable, and 1.32 million transactions were made. Then, Shenxin Yarn Factory devalued and sought to sell. Shuangma sold at a price of 1.25 million, and 20-count Hongrenzhong was sold at a price of 1.2 million, and the amount was very large. Therefore, 20-count brands fell because of this. Small and medium-sized yarns fell by 20,000 to 30,000. Transactions were still rare. However, 42-count double-strand thread was priced at 30,000 yuan because Fangjian had not supplied it the day before.

Yesterday's New York American cotton telegraph was weak in the near term and strong in the long term, with an increase or decrease of 20 or more pounds. The near-term American gold was 32.10, the long-term new flower was 29.27, and the MITL current price was 32.78. Local spot cotton transactions were still rare. Due to the unevenness of foreign cotton, and the fact that the end of the month is approaching, Fangjian and private yarn factories are still waiting and seeing, and there is no purchase. Only the flower shop has a little transaction. The market is generally tired.

The cloth market is boring and unbearable, and current sales are bleak. Therefore, the market is unstable, and the performance has fallen by 250 yuan to 500 yuan. At noon, Fangjian routinely sold Huaji and various cloths, and the price fell by 500 yuan compared with the last time, but the purchasers were as rare as morning stars.

### Coal Arrives

[Reported by this newspaper] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Hai Su vessel transported 4,600 tons of coal from Qinhuangdao. It arrived in port yesterday and berthed at the Zhongzhan Pier No. 3 for unloading.

### Sugar Merchants Hope to Participate in the Distribution; How to Sell the Sixth Batch of Sugar; A True Report Must Be Submitted First

[Reported by this newspaper] After the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau and the company directly distributed sugar to retailers, the general sugar merchants saw that there was no goods to handle. They petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau for relief, believing that the implementation of this measure would cause thousands of employees to lose their jobs. However, the Social Affairs Bureau stated that the sugar industry claimed to still have 15,000 packages of the sixth batch of sugar, and it has not been reported whether it has been sold out, to whom it has been sold, and at what price. Therefore, the distribution of the seventh batch of sugar to the sugar industry has been temporarily suspended. Whether it can be distributed as before will depend on the report submitted by the industry.

### 350 Boxes of Tea are Exported; New and Old Tea are Matched in a 3:7 Ratio

The number of finished red and green teas transported to Shanghai recently is not small, and they are only sold domestically. They are not shipped abroad. The reason is nothing more than the high cost, which has not been able to balance with the export price, so it has not been promoted. It is reported that Huacha Company is scheduled to load 350 boxes of tea on the Sterling vessel sailing from Shanghai to the United States on August 4, including 250 boxes of black tea and the rest green tea, weighing a total of 25,000 pounds. The price of black tea is no more than 57 cents per pound, and the price of green tea is no more than 48.85 cents per pound. According to the above prices, all have not exceeded the US limit. As for how the company promotes the export of Chinese tea, it adopts the method of mixing new and old tea leaves. The content of this batch of goods is 30% new tea, and the rest is old tea, but the stored tea is selected to be qualified. It is also learned that the foreign credit certificate for this shipment can be sent to Shanghai today and tomorrow, at which time it can be delivered to the Bank of China for a foreign exchange low-interest loan package, with a weekly interest rate of only 6%.

### Industrial Raw Materials; Arrive in Droves; Weak Outlets; Price Increase; Many Speculators

Foreign ships loaded with American industrial raw materials have arrived in port one after another, including zinc oxide powder, paraffin, bleaching powder, rosin, paint, and soda ash. Due to the blockage of domestic transportation in Shanghai, actual sales are getting worse and worse. Currently, raw material merchants have two kinds of styles: one is that when foreign prices are constantly rising, those with strong strength mostly stay put, allowing the goods to pile up and wait for the opportunity; the other is that they cannot resist the burden of high interest rates, and once the goods arrive in port, they sell them off to seek money. However, according to the observation of general merchants, the raw materials that are urgently needed in China are also in short supply in the United States. Many raw materials cannot be purchased specifically. There are currently many raw materials that the United States prohibits from exporting, such as caustic soda. However, in terms of the amount of industrial raw materials stored in Shanghai, if the various transportation lines are gradually restored, there will be no excess.

It is also reported that merchants in this port have received letters and telegrams from American exporters or manufacturers that prices have generally increased by one to two, and it is heard that the futures price of American caustic soda is more than 40 US dollars per 100 pounds.

The Production Cost of Products in this Factory is Higher than that of Imported Products

The production cost of factories in Shanghai is not only higher than that of foreign countries, but also higher than anywhere in China. It is learned that the chemical raw materials produced in this city, such as sulfuric acid bleaching powder, are threatened by products from Hong Kong and Taiwan. The price of Hong Kong sulfuric acid and Taiwan bleaching powder, including all transportation costs from the place of production to Shanghai, is much lower than that of products in this city. Therefore, many batches of the above-mentioned chemical raw materials have poured in due to the certainty of profit.

### Domestic Tea Prices Gradually Rise

Recently, domestic sales of red and green tea have been extremely prosperous, especially aged top-grade Bailin and aged medium-grade Zhucha. Shops and brokers in this street are competing to purchase them, leading to repeated price increases. As a result, each dan (unit of weight) has risen by 7,000 to 10,000 yuan compared to before. As for Tuzhuang Huzhou Chouzhen, which is exclusively transported abroad, its new goods this year have been selling since recently. Although the British firm Anhe Yanghang has continued to import 26 boxes, the market sentiment is downward, with each dan falling by 200,000 yuan, a decrease of 5,000 yuan compared to the previous day. In addition, Yulong Yanghang purchased 134 boxes of Taiwan's top-grade red tea, priced at 67,000 yuan per dan, and 80 boxes of Wuyuan aged special tribute tea, priced at 38,000 yuan per dan. The trend is still stable.

### The Origin of Price Discussion; There is No Such Thing as Price Control

[Report from this newspaper] Rumors circulating that the Social Affairs Bureau is controlling prices are unfounded. However, given the significant fluctuations in prices in this port, the bureau drafted a set of regulatory principles two weeks ago and submitted them to the municipal government for approval. The main idea is not to adopt control or price-limiting methods, but rather to use a discussion approach. When necessary, various industry associations will negotiate and set prices autonomously, while the government will stipulate a range for price increases and decreases, prohibiting drastic rises and falls, to reduce volatility and curb speculation. However, if the municipal government does not approve it, or if there is no actual need, it is not intended to implement it universally.

### Wheat Loan Review Committee Held Its First Meeting Yesterday, Deciding on Six Major Principles for Wheat Loans

The Wheat Loan Review Committee held its first meeting yesterday, chaired by the committee chairman Zhao Di. At the meeting, six major principles were decided for important issues related to wheat loans: (1) Wheat should be purchased in different regions, and the price should be determined by the Flour Industry Joint Office in conjunction with the loan syndicate and reported to the Ministry of Food. If the purchase price exceeds 5%, it must also be reported to the Ministry of Food. (2) Flour production standards should comply with the regulations of the Ministry of Food. However, due to the different qualities of wheat produced in various regions, industry associations should submit the actual maximum flour yield rate to the Ministry of Food for approval based on actual conditions. (3) The sales areas for the produced flour should be handled in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Food. However, if there is a surplus in the current fourth consumption area, it may be transported to other ports for sale or purchased by the Ministry of Food. (4) Flour sales prices should be negotiated separately by the Flour Industry Joint Office in conjunction with the syndicate, based on the actual conditions in the sales area, and reported to the review committee for approval. (5) The loan syndicate respects the opinions of the Flour Industry Association, but the association should be responsible for meeting the government's expectations, and large and small factories should cooperate with each other. (6) Banks participating in the syndicate must not easily change the loans to flour mills. The above six principles will be used by the Flour Industry Joint Office to formulate detailed measures and submit them to the review committee for review. The terms regarding loan methods, duration, interest rates, etc., will be formulated by the syndicate.

### Journey to Northern Jiangsu, Part 1: The Complaint of Northern Jiangsu

— Special correspondent Hang Zhou, communication from Taixian of this newspaper, dated the 28th.

Northern Jiangsu—a large, fertile area north of the Yangtze River within Jiangsu Province, with beautiful fields. However, like other so-called "liberated areas" in China, its people still have to wander and flee while people around the world are enjoying peaceful and stable lives. The Chinese Communist Party has made this area one of the main targets of its armed struggle to seize political power.

People in Shanghai, Nanjing, and other parts of China are closely watching the developments in Northern Jiangsu. Because Northern Jiangsu is only separated from Nanjing and Shanghai by a river, people's concern for it may even exceed that for the Northeast. Since the peace negotiations were used as a means of "delay" by the Communist Party and yielded no results, Northern Jiangsu has become the scene of the most acute struggle after the Northeast.

This struggle was undoubtedly created and launched by the Communist Party, but the leaders of the Communist Party are trying to hide it from the eyes of the world, and people around the world are also confused by its clever propaganda. As a result, Northern Jiangsu has almost become a mysterious place. "Seeing once is better than hearing a hundred times." To uncover this mystery, this reporter recently went to Northern Jiangsu.

The Mood of the People

On July 20th, I set off from Shanghai and arrived in Yangzhou, a military stronghold in Northern Jiangsu, the next day. I stayed for three days and then inspected Taixing, where the fighting had been most intense a few days before. Afterwards, I came to another military stronghold—Taixian. In the past week, I have been to places that were either harassed by the Communist army not long ago or were only a short distance from the militia used by the Communist army, and I could hear gunfire at any time. Residents who have experienced many hardships have unanimously told reporters: "Will there ever be an end to our suffering? You journalists should announce the truth to the world and awaken widespread sanction!"

What is the mood of the people in Northern Jiangsu today? I will only write about a personal experience:

On July 24th, a jeep carrying several people in yellow military uniforms came to Xuanjiabao in Taixing County after the great battle. A girl of thirteen or fourteen was the first to spot it and shouted, "The family members are here!" Her voice trembled with joy.

I glanced at her approvingly. Unfortunately, I didn't have the opportunity to talk to her much, but I didn't need to talk much either. I already knew the pain she had suffered in the past and the excitement of seeing her "family members."

It turns out that the people of Northern Jiangsu generally call the National Army "family members." When the New Fourth Army came, they kept their faces taut, their hearts沉着, and their eyes looked at each other with gray eyes. The right hand stretched out four fingers under the cover of the left hand without saying a word.

The Three-Part Play of the Communist Army

In 1940, the New Fourth Army of the Communist Party sneaked into Northern Jiangsu. At that time, there were only a thousand people, and Chen Yi's position was still the commander of the column. On the surface, they were obeying orders to resist the "enemy," but in secret, they came with a major conspiracy. The methods they used were: divide the National Army; organize the people; and tacit agreement with the enemy.

However, the Communist Party does not admit that they did not resist Japan. In fact, they did resist Japan, but it only happened under the following circumstances: When the Japanese army in a certain place only had one company, and the Communist army had several divisions, with sufficient troops and weapons to fight against them, they would attack in one go and occupy that place. As for when the Japanese army counterattacked them, they never had the concept of defending the territory. To preserve their strength for internal use, they would quickly "transfer."

When the National Army was fighting the Japanese army, they hid behind and harassed, ambushed, and looted by fire, intentionally or unintentionally assisting the Japanese army and weakening the National Army's strength.

In organizing the people, anyone who was young was considered a member of the New Fourth Army once they were organized. They plundered the land of the wealthy and distributed it to the poor, who naturally enjoyed following them.... In this way, within a few years, the New Fourth Army grew from ten to a hundred to a thousand, becoming a powerful force. In addition to the regular army, there were local teams and militias. How many in total? Maybe three or four hundred thousand!—It's hard to say an exact number.

The controlled areas were only a few "points" and "lines" for the National Army, and a large number of "areas" fell into the hands of the Communist army, roughly in a ratio of one to five. The New Fourth Army relied on the national crisis to rise, and the entire Chinese Communist Party relied on the national crisis to rise. During the Anti-Japanese War, the national crisis wealth made by traitors and corrupt officials in the occupied areas and the rear was nothing compared to the Communist Party.

Whether in military, economic, or political terms, the Communist Party has deep roots in Northern Jiangsu, naturally occupying an advantageous position. Therefore, if you want the Communist Party to withdraw from Northern Jiangsu, it will be as difficult as wanting the Communist Party to withdraw from Yan'an. The Communist Party not only wants to maintain its existing power in Northern Jiangsu, but also, under the current complex international situation, has begun to use this base to attempt to invade Jinghu and shake the foundation of the country.

### The Battle of Taixing Before and After

This is evident in the recent Battle of Taixing. At the beginning of the campaign, the Communist Party used its usual trick to vigorously propagate that the National Army would take the offensive, confusing the eyes and ears of international personnel. However, those who understand the overall situation know that the Communist Party's propaganda is nothing more than a fantastic myth. Because if the National Army takes any military action, it is to respond to the Communist Army's offensive. If the Communist Army wants to fight the National Army, they can't tell the National Army not to fight back!

From a topographical point of view, Taixing is southeast of Taixian and only separated from Jiangyin by a river. The Communist Army's intelligence is very good. They learned that the National Army only had one regiment stationed there, with weak forces, so they secretly transferred thirteen regiments of troops, led by Su Yu, the commander of the Sixth Division of the New Fourth Army, in an overwhelming posture, and marched rapidly towards Taixing. At the same time, they sent another nine regiments to attack Xuanjiabao, an important stronghold north of Taixing, so that the National Army could not provide reinforcements. The garrison of Xuanjiabao was also only one regiment.

The Communist Army's strategy was quite clever. If it had succeeded, the situation in Jinghu today would have been unimaginable.

But it failed! This was beyond its expectations. On the evening of July 13th, it began to attack, taking the county magistrate and administrative staff who were prepared to take over with them, and telling them, "You can go in four hours."

Frenzied Attack

With a ratio of thirteen to one, the Communist Army rushed forward one after another, truly "brave" to the extreme, launching a violent attack on Taixing. The commander of the defending city was Liu Guangyu, the commander of the 56th Regiment of the 19th Brigade of the 83rd Division. This was a battle-hardened unit. Last year, in the Xiangxi Campaign, it created brilliant achievements at the foot of Xuefeng Mountain. Facing this group of crazy rioters, they were very calm. The machine guns swept in rows, and the Communist Army fell in batches. Another batch surged up, fell again, and another batch came up. When the defenders ran out of bullets, the city gate was breached. Commander Liu personally led a battalion of soldiers to defend Qingyun Temple inside the city. This Qingyun Temple was not made of steel and concrete, but just an old temple. In an emergency, even the fortifications were very hastily constructed. However, the Communist Army captured the city of Taixing, but could not capture Qingyun Temple. So in fact, the National Army never lost Taixing. From the late night of the 13th to the morning of the 16th, the bloody battle lasted for more than forty-eight hours, and Qingyun Temple stood still. Although the National Army suffered heavy casualties, the Communist Army suffered even greater casualties. When Su Yu arrived in the area and saw this situation, he sighed and said, "The New Fourth Army has never seen such a tenacious army in Northern Jiangsu." He called Commander Liu Guangyu "the most stubborn of the stubborn elements" and also called him "Liu the Madman." When Commander Liu talked to me about it, he said, "What's crazy about me? They want to attack me, can't I just let them capture me"!

The Defenders Sing the National Anthem

A company of the 56th Regiment rushed out when the city was breached and then fought back. The Communist Army thought that reinforcements from the National Army had arrived and panicked. At the same time, Li Tianxia, the commander of the 100th Division, told Commander Liu on the phone, "Taixing is the place where you will succeed or die. We revolutionary soldiers must be worthy of the country. Hold on! Reinforcements are coming." These words were overheard by the Communist Army, which became even more panicked. However, at about 3:00 a.m. on the 16th, they launched a final attack and threw a note into Qingyun Temple demanding Commander Liu's surrender. At this time, the two armies were already in close combat. Commander Liu received the note, tore it to pieces, and said loudly, "Revolutionary soldiers do not surrender"! He and the remaining defenders fought back while singing the national anthem and shouting slogans. They fought to the death, ready to die at any time. When the Communist Army heard the song resounding in the sky inside Qingyun Temple, they were surprised: "Why are there still so many people"? They knew it would be difficult to succeed. On the one hand, they received news that the National Army was already attacking their rear. Their morale was shaken, and the whole army collapsed. At about 5:00 a.m. on the 16th, there was not a single Communist soldier in the city of Taixing.

The success of this battle depended on the defenders' die-hard defense, Commander Li's psychological warfare, the Communist Army's rear attack, and the cooperation of local party and government personnel and the people. County Magistrate Xue Peiqi and Commander Liu were in Qingyun Temple together, never leaving each other.

The situation in Northern Jiangsu was stabilized by this battle. Commander Li Tianxia said, "It is unprecedented in the history of the Anti-Japanese War that a city was breached but not completely captured, and an isolated army was able to hold a stronghold and defeat the invaders, recovering the entire city."

The Battle of Xuanjiabao was as fierce as the Battle of Taixing. After two days and nights of fierce fighting, the defenders were left with only seven hundred people. They retreated once, but then Commander Zhong Xiongfei led these seven hundred people back and recaptured the fort.

The total number of Communist Army casualties in the two battles was more than 20,000 (the Communist side admitted to 10,000), while the number of National Army casualties was one-tenth of that. This proves that the Communist Army, apart from relying on a large number of people, is useless in fighting.

After these two battles, the main force of the Communist Army in Northern Jiangsu was severely damaged. Therefore, the National Army recovered Huangqiao and Jiangyan without much effort.

People are Afraid of "Delay"

"I dare say," said Commander Li Tianxia, "if there is an order from above to wipe out Northern Jiangsu at this time, the situation in Northern Jiangsu can be cleared up immediately."

However, this is precisely the National Army's distress! The ceasefire order is only being implemented unilaterally. The National Army is bound by this order and cannot take the initiative except to fight back for self-defense. But the Communist Army can tear up the ceasefire agreement whenever they are happy and attack the National Army; and they don't take the ceasefire agreement seriously at all.

The military situation must be transferred along with the political situation, and unfortunately, the political situation is to delay. Delay is exactly what the Communist Party wants. If it delays, the Communist Party can redeploy, slowly "struggle", and delay until the situation is most favorable before launching a large-scale attack.

"We can't delay!" The people of Northern Jiangsu who love their country unanimously shouted: "Delay will drag us into an abyss from which we cannot be saved!"

The facts that the Communist Party wants to conceal can finally no longer be concealed! During the Anti-Japanese War, the Communist Party propagandized: "We are resisting Japan, and you (referring to the government) are not resisting Japan!" This argument went bankrupt immediately after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War: The Japanese army surrendered to the government. So, the Communist Party immediately changed its tune to: "We are democratic, and you are not democratic." This is really ridiculous. Is the Communist Party democratic? The three million refugees who fled from Northern Jiangsu have already told you clearly; if you still don't believe it, come to Northern Jiangsu to see—the destruction of the entire social order and the destruction of the entire humanity, that is the "democracy" of the Communist Party!

The people of Northern Jiangsu complained: "That is hypocrisy! We want our 'family members' to come back!"

### Typhoon Sweeps Over Taiwan

— Special Correspondent Jiang Muyun, Taiwan Dispatch from this Newspaper, 7th

Typhoons, a special product of Taiwan, have already met this province for the first time this year with a force of 18. Touches of force six to eight have also hit Shanghai. Whether the origins of these great natural storms lie in high or low temperatures is a matter of debate among astronomers in Taiwan and the Philippines. The people of this province are familiar with typhoons, but they cannot help but feel panic when the alerts sound. Now that the first typhoon has passed, the Meteorological Bureau cannot predict when the next wind direction will strike. At the same time, an artificial typhoon is sweeping across the hearts of all the island's inhabitants with equal force. People are worried about how to survive these times and afraid of how to deal with and cope with reality! People say that this unnatural, man-made typhoon was brought by mainlanders and is gradually becoming a specialty of this province.

Unfortunate Women

Taiwan is full of unfortunate women, young, beautiful, and with an elementary education, scattered in taverns, tea houses, and dance halls, serving as extras to be played with and amused by customers, in exchange for hundreds to thousands of legal currency. Some of them have husbands who were drafted and have not been heard from since; some were abandoned by repatriated Japanese; and some have had their entire families sacrificed in bombings. Men have left them to shoulder the burden of life, and life has stolen their youth. They sell their youth under the light of strong liquor and green lamps. They are the fighters on the front lines of the battle of life. Now they face the storm. The authorities have clearly ordered a ban on dancing in July and prostitution in August, and at the same time, the abolition of female attendants. Tens of thousands of female attendants (waitresses) across the province are panicked.

In Taipei, female attendants besieged the office of Xie E, the president of the Women's Association, even making a scene in public. They have only one request: "We need to eat and live." In Kaohsiung, a female attendant named Cai Hua at the Taoyuan Wine House protested the authorities' ban by committing suicide. Actively, more than two hundred people surrounded the residences of Ms. Yang, a cadre of the Women's Association, and Councilor Peng. They have only one hope: the government has banned their profession, so they demand relief and demand work. The public office is responsible for the counties, and the counties and cities are responsible for the townships. The result is that the bans are in place, but these unfortunate women are left empty-handed, or rather, the bans are bans, and the orders are orders!

The Threat of High Prices

Another typhoon force has widely blown onto the people of this province, who are accustomed to taking vehicles and using water and electricity. People no longer recall the Japanese era but use the time of liberation as a ratio. The minimum cost of living used to be 300 yuan, but now it is 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. The first batch of rice has been harvested, and the price of rice has fallen to 11 yuan per catty, but the other six of the seven necessities of life have risen in price, so much so that people cannot believe it. Recently, public utilities in this province, such as postal services, telegrams, electricity, tap water, and trains, have all raised prices one after another, or decided to increase the price by two to three times. The various products of public production organizations are also increasing in price. Newspapers have been forced to raise prices from 18 yuan a month to 60 yuan. This is a direct threat to the six million people of the province and further reduces the people's living standards.

The first thing the Director of Transportation did upon arriving in Taiwan was to have the Hebei ship towed to Shanghai for repair. The second thing was to increase the prices of postal services, telegrams, and trains. Postal services alone have a net deficit of more than 10 million yuan per month. In the past, the Japanese relied on the Monopoly Bureau for 40% of their revenue subsidy, but that is no longer possible. The price of electricity, which has risen from 1.7 cents per kilowatt-hour to 5 jiao per kilowatt-hour, not only puts heavy pressure on users but also severely hits small factories. Publicly funded production organizations cannot but follow suit and increase prices!

Economists say that the mainstays of Taiwan's industrial and mining production are low electricity prices and cheap labor. Abnormal phenomena during the transition period will cause some factories to maintain a long period of stagnation, right?

Salary Increases, Layoffs, and Unpaid Salaries

Local officials who are without plans, those who came to Taiwan from the mainland through connections, put together a makeshift open-air troupe. Some people came with a slave mentality, but now they are enduring the pain of not being able to return to their hometowns. The government raised salaries starting in May, calculated at 33%, but eliminated subsidies, so the actual increase was not much. However, apart from the public office and the directly affiliated institutions of industry, mining, agriculture, and forestry, few people were able to get their salaries by the end of the month, right? The Taipei County government, which brought 260 people to Taiwan, still had only a small portion of May's salaries paid out. It is said that starting in July, salaries will be discounted by 80%, and there will also be layoffs. The Education Department recently convened a provincial education conference. The reports from various counties and cities were all the same, unanimously saying that there was no money. Elementary school teachers have not received a penny for two or three months. Tainan and Kaohsiung cities have also laid off 48 people out of 192, a ratio of 25%. Other institutions are also planning layoffs.

The wave of unemployment in Taiwan is the main cause of unrest. The laid-off personnel will play a significant role in the ranks of the unemployed, while those who can get a job are living in poverty, barely surviving. It is said that the public office will increase salaries again starting in July, increasing the original 33 times to 55 times, but people are not excited about the salary increase because the salary increase is the prelude to unpaid salaries.

An authoritative scholar told the reporter: "I have never heard of government offices and educational institutions owing salaries before, but now it is not uncommon!"

Class Boycotts, Strikes, Market Closures

Because the authorities cannot pay salaries on time, it often constitutes the main cause of school class boycotts and teacher strikes. In the past few months, starting from the class boycott at National Taiwan University Hospital, there have been almost more than 20 school struggles and class boycotts. Taipei, Hsinchu, Taichung, Tainan, and Kaohsiung have all had them. The entire staff of the Qidu Township Office in Keelung District has also started an unprecedented civil servant strike because they have not received a penny for three months.

The secondary cause of class boycotts and teacher strikes is often the lack of coordination between mainlanders and Taiwanese. The situation in the education sector is now very clear: in some urban areas, Taiwanese have taken over everything. Taking over is not necessarily bad, but taking without managing or managing without taking is not acceptable. Mei Qi, the director of the Taipei City Education Bureau, is one of those who have power but cannot place people, resulting in him feeling discouraged and expressing his desire to retire. The discipline of general schools is now far worse than before. Students can endure hardship and work hard, and are willing to study, but they are easily incited. Some of them even think that whether or not to attend class is a matter of freedom and democracy. The misinterpretation of democracy is also a common occurrence.

Recently, more than a dozen taverns in Hsinchu City went on strike to protest donations, and the stalemate has lasted for many days. I think that if life cannot be stable and prices continue to rise, the tide of strikes will only surge and become turbulent, and the distance between Taiwanese and mainlanders will become farther and farther. This is a cause for concern and a difficult problem.

### Meteorological Observatory Received

The Xisha Islands, 1,800 kilometers away from Taiwan, were originally Chinese territory. After France occupied Annam, it included them into the French territory. China and France only drew lines on the map, but the Japanese did not. They started building a meteorological observatory on the small island. France protested, but Japan ignored it. The Xisha Islands are under the jurisdiction of Taiwan. Shi Yanhan, the director of the Taiwan Meteorological Bureau, sent personnel on a small boat to take over on December 12 last year. There was no one on the island, not even a corpse, let alone anyone from the Meteorological Bureau. However, the meteorological equipment was intact. Because there was no one to negotiate with, they had no choice but to erect a monument in front of the wind tower and inscribe it with the words: "The Taiwan Provincial Administrative Governor's Office has completed the takeover." The Meteorological Bureau originally went to take over the Xisha Meteorological Observatory, but in the end, it represented the Governor's Office in taking over the territorial sovereignty of the Xisha Islands. According to Director Shi, "When the staff of the Meteorological Bureau raised the first flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth on this desolate island, there was no band, no people. Seeing the national flag slowly rising in solitude, I was truly filled with infinite emotion. That is how we acquired a new territory for the Republic of China."

Readers, like the reporter, must have the same feelings when they see the photo of the completed takeover wooden sign. Perhaps you think this is a legendary myth, but it is not. This is a very accurate historical record of the takeover of the territory, which Director Shi recently announced to the reporter.

### What is "Project Cost"?

A fellow villager from Xinzhong Township, Xueyan Bridge, Wujin, came to say: The township chief of our village has already decided to levy a field donation this summer: 7% of military rice (substituting wheat) per mu (each package weighs 178 catties on the market scale); 5% of wheat per package for project costs (one-third of which will be used for local education funds, but the education funds needed in our village do not actually need one-third of the 5% package, only one-fifth is enough). Do we need military rice or not (the Shanghai newspaper previously reported that 800,000 dan of military rice owed by Jiangsu Province has been approved for exemption from recovery)? This is a central matter, and we will not deal with it for the time being. As for the so-called project costs, could it be that the township chief and the loafers in the township office spend money on extravagant pleasures, squandering public funds, and this is considered a major project? We don't know if the authorities have clearly stipulated that they do this? Has the government not noticed that the evil flames of the enemy and puppet era that exploited the farmers have been rekindled? In short, we beg the parents and officials of the authorities to relieve the people from their suffering under the principle of valuing the people, so that they can barely survive. Then the countryside will be fortunate! The nation will be fortunate!

### Three Sheng Deducted for Rat Consumption

Editor Sir:

This year, I enrolled in the county middle school of Wujiang County as a boarder. Each student pays six dou of rice for meals. As a result, at the end of the semester, each person was specially deducted three sheng of rice for rat consumption. The reason is that the rice stored by the boarders is stored in the (storage room, and it is eaten by rats, so each student is deducted three sheng for rat consumption. However, there are more than 100 boarders in Wujiang Middle School, and more than three dan of rice can be obtained every semester (one semester is four months). Could there be such big rats that eat eight dou of rice every month? There is no shortage of poor farmers' children in Wujiang Middle School. It is already difficult for them to send their children to school, and they have to add three sheng of rice, increasing the burden on parents. Although three sheng of rice is only worth more than 2,000 yuan, it is also a large sum for poor families. I hope that this item can be removed starting from the next semester.

### A Record of a Pilgrimage to India's Sacred Sites

— Calcutta News, July 6th, Zhou Xiangguang

Having dwelt in my humble abode for thirty years, I came to pay homage to the meditative saint; under the third watch moon on the Ganges, a ten-foot lotus blooms atop the Himalayas; after explaining the emptiness of the military, I try to see my face before birth, seeking the elixir of life from the master, I laugh at myself as a child curing a childhood ailment.

Recalling two years ago, I came to India from my homeland to study, and while discussing Indian philosophy with teachers and friends, I heard of the contemporary Indian sages Sri Aurobindo and Sir Raman, arousing in me a fervent religious longing. Both resided in South India, further fueling my interest in a long journey, an ideal which ultimately became reality. Finally, on April 24th of this year, I met the sages Sri Aurobindo and Raman, adding a brilliant and memorable page to the journey of my life! On the afternoon of April 20th, I left Calcutta, the sweltering heat making the long journey of thousands of miles seem daunting, but the passion of religious faith encouraged me to move forward. Besides several Indian friends, the entire student body of the Calcutta Chinese School saw me off at the station. Soon, the whistle blew, and the train rumbled southward, traveling along the coast. From the train, I gazed at the Bay of Bengal, an expanse of blue sea pouring into the ocean, and closer, at the fields, the verdant spring grass, the scenery of the Buddhist country resembling my homeland of Jiangnan. Reciting the Southern Tang Emperor's poem, "The rising sun paints river blossoms redder than fire, the coming spring makes river waters greener than indigo," I couldn't help but feel transported. There were also several allies on the train, newly arrived from China. Some worked for the 14th Air Force in our country, others served in medical relief on the Burma Road. They expressed their admiration for the bravery of our soldiers and civilians in resisting Japan. Our conversations eased the loneliness of the journey.

(1) A Glimpse of Madras

Two days on the train felt extremely tiring. On the 22nd at noon, I finally arrived in Madras, one of the three major administrative regions of British India, about 1,100 miles from Calcutta. Calculated in our country's miles, it's almost from Guangzhou to Beijing. Although Madras is not as bustling and prosperous as Calcutta, the streets are clean, and the buildings are well-ordered, giving it the air of a modern city. After getting off at Madras Central Station, I, along with Indian friends Sinha Ghattashru and Geshe Samy, transported our luggage by rickshaw to the waiting room at Egmore Station. Then, we visited the local Chinese community leader, Bao Li Zhuguangsheng. Sri Aurobindo resided in French Pondicherry, and the train to that place departed in the evening. Therefore, we used the half-day of daylight to visit friends and see the sights of Madras. There were over a hundred overseas Chinese there, mostly from Shandong province, followed by Hubei and Guangdong provinces. They mostly ran restaurants, shoe stores, and dental clinics, all working hard and passionately contributing to public welfare, earning the respect of the local British and Indian people. Last year, Consul General Jun Jian (now the ambassador to Peru) inspected the area and instructed them to establish a Chinese United Association to promote unity and strengthen friendship. Over the past year, with the efforts of Bao Xianyi, Li Rujie, and Sun Qingtian, significant progress has been made, and they are not behind others in donating money to save the country. Hearing of my arrival, they all came to inquire. With the flames of war raging in our homeland, it is a joy to be able to gather in this Buddhist country. Until 7:00 PM, the train departed from Madras towards Villupuram. The passengers were very crowded, some going to Ceylon, others to the princely state of Travancore. There was also a cloth merchant on the train, a graduate of the University of Madras. We conversed, and he was proud that India had maintained its indigenous culture. I replied that China had also maintained its four-thousand-year-old national culture, but in terms of clothing, food, housing, and transportation, we have adopted Western civilization. Culture and civilization are two different things. You cannot see me wearing Western clothes and immediately label it as Western culture; that would be a great mistake. He agreed. At 11:00 PM, the train arrived at Villupuram Station. I got off and went to the waiting room. At 5:00 AM the next morning, I finally took a special car to French Pondicherry, arriving at my destination at 7:00 AM. Soon, an Indian student came to inquire, "Is Mr. Zhou Xiangguang here?" I replied, "Mr. Zhou is me." This student was named Ayuwang, sent by Indian friend Professor Meiqila to welcome me. We took the car to the ashram (meaning religious research institute). On the way, we met Professor Mei, exchanging brief greetings and inquiring whether Mr. Tan Yunshan was well. They had both studied with Aurobindo in the past. I then went to the Guregang Building to rest. This four-story, rectangular building was designed by a famous Japanese engineer. Each floor has about twenty rooms, and each person occupies one room, making it very comfortable. The building is managed by an English woman named Ms. Menon. Upon seeing me, she was very happy. We felt only serenity and no disturbance of the mind while staying here. The construction cost of this building reached over ten thousand Indian rupees, donated by the King of the princely state of Hyderabad. Sri Aurobindo established an ashram as a place to spread his teachings, with over a hundred buildings located in the east of the city, overlooking the Bay of Bengal, a tranquil and serene place suitable for spiritual practice. Aurobindo is seventy-four years old this year, with white hair and a youthful face, possessing an aura of dignified composure, inspiring respect.

(2) The Compassionate Light of the Mother

Aurobindo graduated from Cambridge University in England in his youth, fluent in Latin, Greek, German, Italian, and especially proficient in Sanskrit and Pali. He served as the president of the public colleges of Baroda and Bengal. Later, due to his advocacy for Indian independence, he participated in actual political activities, organizing the Nationalist Party, serving as its leader. His younger brother also organized revolutionary groups, was suspected of crimes, arrested and imprisoned. Ultimately, due to insufficient evidence, he was imprisoned for over a year before being released. While in prison, Aurobindo devoted himself to Yoga, attained enlightenment, and then traveled to Pondicherry, continuing to publish the "Arya" magazine, proclaiming his enlightenment to the world, revealing the sacredness of life, and seeking to bring all beings to the other shore. For thirty-five years, he has diligently strived, which is readily apparent. Since 1930, Aurobindo has remained silent, not speaking to anyone, except for discussing the Dao with The Mother, Mira Alfassa. The Mother is French, sixty-four years old this year. In her youth, she aspired to cultivate truth. As she grew older, she devoted herself to seeking the Dao, her footprints covering countries around the world. In 1920, she came to India from Japan, met Aurobindo in Pondicherry, and after discussing with him, she had a profound awakening. She then joined Aurobindo in devoting herself to the sacredness of life. The so-called sacredness of life is to transform humanity from ordinary to sacred. She also co-edited the "Arya" magazine with Aurobindo. Today, Aurobindo's disciples call her The Mother, but they call Aurobindo Master. The Mother walks in the garden every morning, at which time all the disciples stand respectfully by the side, palms together, paying their respects. The Mother responds with a smile, radiating compassion. In the evening, there is usually a meditation session. The disciples in the ashram sit together under the Giving Tree, gathering their minds, seeking unity with the Void. The fragrance of the Giving Tree flowers, the gentle breeze caressing the face, at this moment, this scene truly resembles the Seven Jewels adorned Pure Land described in the Amitabha Sutra. After an hour of silent sitting, one feels refreshed in body and mind. If we can break through our ego and reach a state of no-self, then this true self is God. The Dao is not far from people; it is people who distance themselves. At that time, we also individually visited The Mother, as that evening was the 25th anniversary of The Mother's arrival here to cultivate truth. Small paths in the ashram were covered with fresh flowers. When I bowed, The Mother smiled, her compassion evident on her face, and bestowed a flower as a memento. This flower is pure, this flower is sacred. We in the Saha world are all stained with mud, unable to be close to the heart of Heaven, experiencing only suffering and no joy, only vexation and no purity. Reflecting on the flower, my feelings of emotion increase! I placed this flower on my desk, offering my sincere respects, respecting the flower is respecting the heart of Heaven.

(3) A Moment of Connection

On the morning of the 24th, Aurobindo personally signed and gifted me over ten of his major works, including "The Life Divine" (regarded by Europeans as a major philosophical work of the 20th century), "Essays on the Gita," "The Isha Upanishad," and "The Foundations of Yoga." The Mother did the same. The two elderly people also wanted to gift me their recent photos with their signatures. I am unworthy of such special treatment. In the future, I can only follow the teachings of the two elders, devoting a portion of my effort to the sacred work of human life to repay them. At 2:00 PM, it was the time for us lay disciples to bow and pay homage to Aurobindo. Including the disciples of the ashram, there were about four hundred people, with about a hundred people coming from all over the north and south, including nineteen famous university professors, and many British and French people. At that time, Aurobindo and The Mother sat together in a room, Aurobindo on the right, The Mother on the left. We each held a bouquet of fresh flowers as an offering. When I offered flowers to the two elders, I felt spiritually fulfilled, and all distractions disappeared. Aurobindo wore a white Indian robe, his arms bare, his hair and beard a golden yellow, his spirit vigorous, his demeanor dignified, his body tall and strong. The Mother wore an Indian sari. Both elders smiled in response to us. That moment was the origin of my connection with Sri Aurobindo.

(4) A Short Stay in Pondicherry

Afterwards, The Mother asked Aurobindo, "Did you see the young Chinese man, Mr. Zhou, who came to visit?" Aurobindo said, "I know him, I saw him." The Indians were even more respectful, as every year no less than ten thousand people request to visit, but only several hundred are granted permission, and even fewer obtain Aurobindo's approval. In the past, the daughter of American President Wilson also came to visit, staying for a short time before leaving. I stayed in Aurobindo's ashram for as long as half a month. Every day, besides reading, I discussed philosophical questions about the sacredness of life with Aurobindo's major disciples, such as N.K. Gupat, Pavitala S.K. Mlilra, Nirada Ray, and Purani. I also first used the Neo-Confucianism of the Song and Ming dynasties in our country to explain that Indian philosophy can be combined with the enlightenment of Yoga. First, one understands the truth, and then one understands the usual principles. Chinese philosophy attempts to experience the truth from the midst of principles. Although the methods are different, the ultimate goal is the same. The Buddha said that the truth of the universe is only one, but sentient beings see it differently. The theory of the sacredness of life created by Aurobindo is a major school in the modern idealistic school, regarded by Indians as the reincarnation of a great sage from two thousand years ago, the soul of the Indian Renaissance. In the past, the poet Tagore wrote a poem after visiting Aurobindo: "Aurobindo, may he receive my respectful bow! Today I see you, all wisdom. When I see you again in the future, I will have no words to sing of! May he receive my respectful bow!" The French literary giant Romain Rolland also said: "Aurobindo combines and harmonizes European and Asian philosophies and cultures." His admiration can be seen from this.

The ashram has a library, a bank, a factory, a hospital, and a small elementary school attached to it. The students, over a hundred people, are all children of the monks in the ashram, mainly studying English, French, and Indian languages, with other sciences secondary. The library has hundreds of thousands of books, mostly in English, French, and Indian languages, and publishes a quarterly magazine called "Descent," which serves as a writing platform for the disciples. Pondicherry is the capital of French India, with a governor's mansion and a high court. The University of Paris also has a liberal arts college here. I visited the liberal arts college, which had several hundred students, and the lectures were all in French. The law school is attached to the High Court. There is also a medical school, but I did not visit it because I am not familiar with medicine. The local Indians can all speak French, but not English. All the store signs are written in both French and Tamil. I spoke with the registrar of the liberal arts college, asking if graduates of Chinese schools could directly enter the college. He replied that if they knew French, they could, otherwise they would have to take a year of remedial courses. I found my stay in Pondicherry quite comfortable, but due to pressing school matters, I could not stay for long. Therefore, on May 5th, I took a train back to Madras. That evening, before leaving Pondicherry, I bid farewell to The Mother and expressed my aspirations and plans for the sacredness of life in the future, and I was given full instructions and permission. All my friends in the ashram saw me off at the station. The train departed at 9:00 PM, and I arrived safely in Madras at 7:00 AM the next morning. The next day, my Indian friend Seth Saman came and accompanied me to visit the University of Madras. The university is located on the coast, with a beautiful scenery and dozens of buildings, among which the Provincial College is the largest. Unfortunately, the school was on summer vacation, so I could not visit in detail, only browsing through the library. The library has millions of books, including over one hundred thousand on Indian philosophy. However, there was only one book on Chinese philosophy, the Laozi's Daodejing (English translation). Foreigners who want to study Chinese culture are hindered by language and writing. Scholars in our country who are proficient in both Chinese literature and history and foreign languages are very few, so we cannot transplant our culture abroad, which is a great pity. I met Professor Gosber of Negpo University at the hotel, and we had a very pleasant discussion on yoga philosophy. Then, we took a train together to the city of Tiruvannamalai to see the master Ramana.

(5) Meeting the Zen Master

At 7:00 PM that evening, the train departed from Madras, and I arrived in Tiruvannamalai the next morning. The area is mountainous, and the climate is very hot. One cannot step outside the door in the afternoon. I was confined to my room, and it only felt cool in the evening. After arriving in Tiruvannamalai, Professor Gosber and I stayed at the home of Dr. D. Roy. Dr. Roy is a famous professor at the University of Madras, who recently retired to the countryside due to old age and is studying Sunya Yoga (what the Chinese call esoteric studies) under Ramana. When I visited the master Ramana, I presented fresh flowers and fruit as an offering. Seeing me, he smiled, nodded in response, and instructed me to sit on the floor. The master sat on the bed, silently entering into meditation. Ramana had established an ashram himself at the foot of Mount Arunachala. There were nearly a hundred people practicing the Dao in the ashram. He and his disciples sat together in the same room day and night, eating together in the same room. He wore only a pair of shorts, carried a staff, and had nothing else. He and his disciples did not transmit through spoken or written words, but through the direct transmission from mind to mind. If someone asked how to begin Zen meditation, he would say, "Who are you?" The implication is that our current body is not the true self, but a false self. If we can find the true self, then this true self is God, as large as the universe, united with heaven and earth. Therefore, the teachings of the master Ramana are the true transmission of the Dharma Ancestor, whose arrival in China formed the Zen sect, a separate transmission outside the scriptures. If we want to find the true self, we must break through our ego, reach a state of no-self, and not stain anything in our hearts. The ancient Buddha said, "The wild goose flies obliquely across the pond, leaving its reflection, the reflection fades, yet the bottom remains crystal clear." Then, seeing anything, we will see life, see the heart of heaven. "The stream's body is everywhere the broad and long tongue, the mountain's color is nothing but the pure body." Du Fu's saying, "Casually recognize the face of the east wind, ten thousand purples and thousands of reds are all spring" also means seeing the heart of heaven. The master Ramana is sixty-four years old this year, his hair and beard already white. He left home at the age of sixteen. At that time, he was participating in an admission test at the University of Madras when he suddenly became enlightened. He then abandoned his family and sat in a mountain cave for eighteen years. After his merits were fulfilled, he began to descend the mountain to teach his disciples, establishing an ashram in Tiruvannamalai. Today, the Indians call him the great saint Maha Rishi. I have portraits of Ramana and Sri Aurobindo in India, which shows the Indians' admiration for them. I stayed in Ramana's ashram for a total of four days, sitting with the master in the same room day and night. Although I did not attain enlightenment, I also learned a little about intellectual wisdom. There are many miraculous events related to the master Ramana and Sri Aurobindo, but ordinary people may criticize them as unscientific, so I will not describe them.

On May 15th, I returned to Madras, where I received a warm welcome from the local overseas Chinese. I am grateful from the bottom of my heart. On the 19th, I returned safely to Calcutta. In summary, this trip to South India covered tens of thousands of miles and lasted for a month. Visiting the two major contemporary philosophers of India, strengthened my confidence in the study of settling the heart and establishing life, and made my desire to serve humanity even firmer. After returning to Calcutta, I convened all the colleagues and students of the Chinese School to give a lecture on this trip and concluded:

(1) It is not impossible for human beings to transform from ordinary to sacred, and there are methods that can be followed, depending on the strength of our minds and determination.

(2) The strength of a country depends on what its national mind and talent are focused on.

(3) We must make great vows and generate great compassion, and work for the peaceful future of the world's humanity.

I recall that when I was young, I recited Mr. Liang's thirtieth birthday poem from Xinhui, "The world is infinite, the wishes are endless, the sea and sky are vast, standing for a long time." The ambition soared, unstoppable. Now I am willing to share these words with the scholars to study together and see every Sanskrit classic and encourage each other.

### Hunan Tea and Tung Oil: A Precipitous Decline

— Special Correspondent Gao Yuanli reports from Changsha on the 20th of this month

China is an agricultural nation, and Hunan can be considered a representative of agricultural society. While grains and miscellaneous cereals are Hunan's primary produce, its secondary products, tea and tung oil, undoubtedly occupy a crucial position in the province's rural economy. Rural prosperity certainly depends on abundant harvests of grains and cereals, but sluggish sales of tea and tung oil are also sufficient to contribute to the decline of Hunan's rural areas.

Tea-Producing Areas: 64 Counties

Although Hunan's agriculture in the past eight years has been barely satisfactory, it has seen bumper harvests every year except last year. However, Hunan has been most affected by the enemy's blockade policy, which has prevented the export of its tea and tung oil, directly reducing rural income. The rampant and devastating famine of the past six months, while seemingly a matter of starvation, is inextricably linked to this issue.

Tea-producing areas in Hunan account for 64 out of the province's 76 counties. The 17 counties of Linxiang, Anhua, Pingjiang, Xiangyin, Taoyuan, Xinhua, Chen County, Yueyang, Changsha, Shimen, Cili, Xiangxiang, Yuanling, Ling County, Shaoyang, and Wugang have the highest and most famous production. Their total output ranks third in the country. In terms of quality, Anhua's black tea and brick tea, and Linxiang's dark brick tea, are the most renowned, with sales markets extending both domestically and abroad. Brick tea is particularly essential for the Soviet Union. In recent years, due to traffic congestion during the war, sales have been extremely sluggish.

Among the aforementioned products, Anhua tea deserves the most attention. Anhua is located in the central part of the Zishui River basin, and the entire county is suitable for tea cultivation. Production also occurs in various places along the Zishui River basin outside of Anhua. Millions of farmers rely on this for a living, with Anhua being the main production and distribution center. Tea is divided into five types: first, black tea, also known as "Yin Tea." This was established when Zuo Zongtang quelled the New Province and requested the adoption of a system similar to salt licenses, where merchants would contract to manage and sell the tea, transporting it to the Northwest, and calling it "Yin Tea." Second, red tea, known in the international market as "Xianghong." Third, green tea. Fourth, brick tea. Except for a portion of green tea used locally in Hunan Province, the other types are almost entirely exported. Statistics show that from the 27th year of Guangxu to the 4th year of the Republic (1901-1915), red tea had an average annual output of 40,000 boxes, but its quality was inferior to Keemun tea, making it difficult to compete with Anhui tea, leading to a precipitous decline. After 1943, annual production was only 2,000 boxes.

Black Tea: Essential in the Northwest

Black tea is essential for people in the Northwest, much like salt is an indispensable food item for us. Therefore, its sales are extremely brisk. In prosperous years, production could reach 2,000 licenses, approximately 120,000 dan. In ordinary years, it would produce 1,200 licenses, equivalent to over 70,000 dan. In 1941, production was only 17,400 dan. Although it increased by 23,851 dan in 1942, the entire amount was purchased by the China Tea Company. After 1943, due to transportation issues, no one purchased black tea, and its production became even smaller. Anhua still has 100 tons of inventory that has not been shipped out. An additional 300 tons have been transported to Hankou, Yiyang, and Zhengzhou, but have not been sold, leading tea merchants to hesitate to continue production.

Brick Tea: Convenient Transportation

Brick tea is a recent invention. It is essentially black tea that has been pressed into bricks for ease of transportation. Its primary customers are the Soviets. With the establishment of the Sino-Soviet barter agreement, the tea industry revived. Wuhan became an important commercial port for the transshipment of Hunan tea. The government monopolized the purchase and sale of tea to earn foreign exchange. Thus, the Hunan Brick Tea Factory of the Central Trust Bureau's Barter Division was established. The factory was originally the Tea Management Office of the Hunan Construction Department. In 1941, it was renamed the Provincial Brick Tea Factory. In 1942, it partnered with the China Tea Company and was renamed the Hunan Brick Tea Factory of the China Tea Company. After the China Tea Company was merged and then split from the company, it did not resume operations. Another tea factory, the Hunan Provincial Tea Factory, was reorganized from the Anhua Tea Farm of the Agricultural Improvement Institute. These two factories were government-operated. Private tea factories are scattered throughout Dongping, Huangshaping, and other areas of Anhua County. The more famous ones include the Xinyi Company Anhua Tea Factory, Liangyi Tea Factory, and Huaan Company, which produce red and green tea and use small wooden brick presses to produce one-jin brick tea. However, their resources are not as strong as the government-operated tea factories, resulting in limited production.

Tea Farmers: Livelihoods in Jeopardy

The situation in the Anhua tea region is roughly as described above. As for the plight of the tea farmers, it is even more unimaginable. Tea farmers value their tea forests as much as they value their fields. Before the implementation of the unified purchase and sale policy, tea farmers would bring their harvested tea to the market and sell it freely, without experiencing much suffering. However, after the unified purchase and sale policy was implemented, the tea prices were fixed, but tea farmers could not directly trade with the China Tea Company and had to go through intermediaries. As a result, the tea farmers' income was insufficient to cover the cost of fertilizers and labor. Later, when sales channels were cut off and no one was buying, their suffering became even more unbearable. Near Anhua, many tea farmers were tempted to use their tea trees for firewood and charcoal. This year, with the end of the war, the tea industry could have been expected to recover, but it has been hampered by foreign exchange restrictions, making exports impossible and hindering its revival.

The government's lack of comprehensive relief measures for the tea industry has also contributed to its decline. Although the Construction Department has approved a tea loan of 100 million yuan, it is only intended to alleviate the stagnation of Anhua's tea inventory, and it does not greatly benefit the tea farmers. According to Mr. Peng Xianze, the director of the Hunan Brick Tea Factory, Hunan tea is indeed of high quality, but poor production methods have made it impossible to compete in the international market, which is a pity. If the government could provide substantial loan relief and encourage exports, it might not be able to replace Ceylon tea, but it could still occupy a place in the international tea market, and tea farmers would indirectly benefit from the large-scale export of tea.

Tung Oil: Reduced Production

Tung oil is a unique product of China and also a specialty of Hunan. According to the customs trade records, from the 32nd year of Guangxu (1906) to the 30th year of the Republic (1941), the export volume of Hunan tung oil increased from 227 dan to 600,000 dan. However, comparing the 600,000 dan in 1941 with the 533,000 dan in 1929, the actual production has not increased but decreased.

The reason for the reduced production is not that the government has not promoted and encouraged it. In fact, the government has achieved considerable success in planting. In the spring of 1936, the government established four memorial forests in Lingling, Nanyue, and Yueyang, and ordered the Provincial Highway Bureau to plant tung trees along both sides of the highways, and formulated a plan for planting tung trees in townships and villages in Hunan Province. Using cooperative methods, each township was given seeds and 2,000 yuan of provincial bank funding, with a plan to plant 3,000 tung trees in 1940 and increase the planting by 1,000 to 2,000 trees each year thereafter. This shows the active promotion of tung tree planting in Hunan.

Tung Forests: Distribution

The distribution of tung forests in Hunan is mainly in western Hunan, followed by southern Hunan. Tung oil produced along the Yuan River basin in western Hunan accounts for 60% of the province's total. Yuanling County alone produces 50,000 dan annually. In total, the counties along the Yuan River produce over 370,000 dan annually. The Xiang River basin accounts for 16% of the province's total, with a total annual production of about 100,000 dan. The Zi and Feng Rivers also have a small amount of annual production, mostly three-year-old tung trees.

In August 1936, the government began to improve tung oil pressing methods in order to compete in the foreign market. It established vegetable oil factories in various places to improve quality, which achieved great results. The export volume of Hunan tung oil also increased daily, and the tung oil industry flourished. However, good times did not last. In 1937, the war broke out, and there was no way to export. The Ministry of Finance's Reconstruction Company was responsible for unified purchase and sale. When the Burma Road was cut off, the Reconstruction Company also stopped purchasing, and tung oil changed from export to domestic sales. In the country, in addition to being used for lighting, it was once used to refine gasoline, but the cost was too high, and it could not be developed.

Exports: Not Hopeless

After the end of the war, the dream of exporting tung oil still could not be realized. Tung oil stagnated in the production areas, accumulating like mountains. On the one hand, there were no sales channels, and on the other hand, the disaster was severe, and many farmers gave up harvesting, allowing the tung fruit to rot. As a result, production in western Hunan has almost fallen to half of what it used to be.

But is there hope for exporting tung oil? Have American substitutes replaced the position of tung oil? The answer is: there is still hope. According to the Business Daily, "After the lifting of tung oil consumption controls after the war, the maximum consumption in the United States can still reach 100 million pounds per year, so the United States is still a market for our country's tung oil."

Tung Trees: Crisis Lurks

However, even if there is a large foreign market, without government support, it will still be impossible to export. The cost is high, and the freight is large. The price of tung oil in Changsha is 40,000 yuan per dan, and the freight from Changsha to Shanghai is 30,000 yuan per dan. The freight and import tax from Shanghai to the United States increase the cost to over 80,000 yuan per dan. However, the American market price is 35 cents per pound, which is 70,000 yuan per dan. This means that merchants who ship to the United States for sale must incur a loss of about 10,000 yuan per dan, with no profit at all. Merchants are reluctant to proceed, and the government has no policy to subsidize this difference. How can a large-scale export be achieved? The most affected are still the tung farmers. Some say that if this continues, tung trees will disappear in China in a few years. Although this may be an exaggeration, it shows the magnitude of the crisis.

The vegetable oil factories in Hunan are planning to improve the quality and utilization of tung oil. They have ordered a large number of oil presses from the United States. Currently, the Changde factory can press 20 tons of oil per month. They hope to use a portion of the tung oil to manufacture paint and soap. However, this is still a temporary solution. If a fundamental solution is not sought, the crisis will still exist.

### Emergency Report from Songjiang Reader: Cholera Rampant, Deaths Soaring

Seeking Solutions to Emergency Aid Problems, Answered Quickly by This Newspaper's Advisor

Mr. Editor: Greetings. Since true cholera began spreading in our town last month, the affected area has gradually expanded. Although patients have received treatment from Western doctors, early injections of appropriate amounts of saline and cardiac stimulants, oral anti-emetics and anti-diarrheals, and absorbent remedies, very few have recovered. The majority of patients experience a gradual return of body temperature and pulse after saline injections, only to suffer a relapse after two or three hours, leading to an irreversible state and a shockingly high mortality rate of approximately 80% or more! Having read in the newspapers that the mortality rate of cholera in Shanghai is only below 20%, the difference is so vast. Currently, the villagers have lost faith in Western medicine, and Chinese medicine offers no solution. Upon discovering the disease, they simply resign themselves to fate and await death helplessly, which is truly tragic! Driven by compassion, I have specially recorded a few questions and respectfully request that you take the time to inquire at Shanghai hospitals or specialist physicians regarding the details of cholera treatment, including the medications used, and publish them in the newspaper so that physicians in epidemic areas can refer to and adopt them to save the sinking and reduce the mortality rate. This would be a truly immeasurable act of merit.

The questions are listed below, please answer them separately:

(1) Symptomatic Treatment: What are the effective treatments for vomiting and diarrhea? (Vomiting is truly dreadful; even medications are vomited upon entry, preventing them from having any effect. Are there any special injectable medications that can stop vomiting, allowing medications to be administered? Diarrhea is also terrible; after two or three major bouts of diarrhea, dehydration symptoms appear. Common absorbents like charcoal are completely ineffective. Please publish effective anti-diarrheal prescriptions for physicians to use.)

(2) Etiological Treatment: Which bactericidal agents are most effective? Which ones are used in Shanghai?

(3) Plasma Injections: Are plasma or blood protein injections more effective than saline injections, and how much should be injected? How much does 500 cc cost?

(4) How should cholera-induced acidosis be treated?

(5) What diuretic medications are appropriate for cholera patients who also suffer from urinary retention?

Awaiting publication or reply, with respectful greetings,

Lu Xibai, Songyin, Songjiang

Answer from Medical Doctor Tang Renjin

The reasons why Shanghai cholera patients have a lower mortality rate are as follows:

(1) Upon discovery, patients are immediately sent to epidemic hospitals for emergency treatment. (2) There are numerous epidemic isolation hospitals throughout the city, staffed by experts day and night, with ample supplies of medications and equipment. (3) Transportation is convenient. Rural areas lack epidemic hospitals, or if they exist, they are poorly equipped. Patients lack regular medical care. Upon discovering cholera, they often first try scraping, take herbal remedies, and seek divine intervention, resulting in delayed treatment and lost opportunities. Here are my answers to the five questions:

(1) For vomiting and diarrhea, morphine is commonly injected, or tincture of opium is taken orally, and ice cubes are held in the mouth. (2) Sulfa-Guanidine can be taken orally. (3) For plasma injections, Shanghai uses mostly American products (originally named Human Plasma). Each 500 cc bottle costs approximately 30 US dollars, equivalent to 70,000 to 80,000 yuan in national currency. (4) Acidosis is caused by a lack of water in the body after vomiting and diarrhea. To prevent it, an alkaline solution containing glucose is usually injected first (commercially available as Locke's solution), followed by physiological saline or Ringer's solution. This can quickly take effect and avoid acidosis. (5) Urinary retention is closely related to the prognosis of the disease. Therefore, in treatment, the importance of diuretics and cardiac stimulants is no less than saline injections. According to a report by Rumqe, the mortality rate for those with complete anuria is 57.2%. For those without urinary retention, it is only 4.7%. Common diuretic and cardiac stimulants, such as Caffeine, S.B, Digalin, Sol, Camphor, Hexeton, Aoramin, Diuretin, Urotropin, Strophautin, etc., can be taken orally or injected.

My opinion:

(1) Universal and mandatory cholera vaccinations should be implemented. (2) Cholera vibrios are generally present in the feces and vomit of patients. The main vehicle of transmission is water, as the patient's excrement mixes with the water in wells and rivers. Your area does not have running water. If patients' clothes and items contaminated with excrement are washed in the river or near wells, and even rice is washed and vegetables are cleaned in the same place, it is extremely easy to transmit the disease. Flies are also a major carrier. Therefore, local enlightened people must advise the public to pay attention to the above points to prevent future problems. DDT can be used for fly control. Drinks should be boiled. Do not eat raw or cold fruits and vegetables, or food that flies have landed on. Bleach and lime can be added to raw water. (3) The excrement of patients must be disinfected with concentrated lime, and clothes and utensils should also be boiled for disinfection.

### Striving for World Peace: How to Overcome the Seven Hurdles? Success Depends on the Power of the Peace Conference

— Translated and abridged by Junmo

The first post-war peace conference has already opened in Paris. Since the end of the war, the world has been trembling under an atmosphere of tension. Will humanity head towards an even more terrifying war? Will human wisdom be able to win tomorrow's peace and civilization? The renowned British historian and Oxford University Professor of International Relations, Professor Weihua Te, believes that the fate of world civilization depends on how we deal with the following seven major challenges today.

The war has passed, but it is really hard to say whether we have truly won, because we have not yet escaped the post-victory danger period. Whether the peace and culture of tomorrow's world can be maintained depends on whether we can solve the seven main factors most closely related to it today:

(1) Famine, Material and Psychological Upheaval

The first issue, or rather the first set of issues, is the material and psychological devastation left behind after the war. Famine has spread throughout the world, and a hungry world is unable to maintain a peaceful order. Not only that, but due to a lack of machinery, productivity has greatly decreased; due to a lack of housing, the foundation of healthy family life has been damaged; and the decline in material life inevitably leads to a decline in spiritual life. In war, the only training is in destruction and slaughter. How should we bring this deviation from the standards of civilized life back to the moral standards of love and affection between people? This is a very important matter.

(2) The German Question

This matter is a dilemma. If we forever suppress them with force, then six million people with a high degree of civilization will live a semi-primitive, non-industrialized life for a long time, which will leave Europe in poverty forever. Moreover, the existence of such a factor will make it difficult to establish a sound and stable Europe. But if we help Germany to recover, it may well turn around and try to conquer Europe by force again. The Germans' thinking has not changed as much as we had hoped. History tells us that the recovery of a defeated country is faster in modern times. This requires very careful handling.

(3) The Rise of the Slavic People

A prominent feature of post-war Europe is the resurgence of the Slavic people. The importance of this fact is no less than the succession of maritime powers in the 16th and 17th centuries to colonial countries in the 18th century, and then to industrial countries in the 19th century. The resurgence of the Slavic people in Europe certainly does not mean that any serious and profound conflict will occur between Britain and the Soviet Union. In terms of resources, the Soviet Union should not look to expand further in Europe, but currently, there are two places that could cause problems: one is in Greece, and the other is in Norway. The Norwegian problem may be even more important, especially for the United States.

(4) New World Strategy

New warfare methods have brought a new political situation to this post-war world. The Mediterranean has lost its importance for Far East navigation, which means that maritime hegemony alone is useless. The defense of Gibraltar is of little value today, and Malta is no longer of much use either. Currently, for Europe, the harbors and bases of East Africa are far more important than the Suez Canal. Because of this relationship, Britain is more concerned about the future of the Italian colony of Somaliland.

Arctic traffic is also one of the issues on which countries have focused their attention after the war. Alaska and the Kamchatka Peninsula have become strategic locations, because in terms of the distance between states, traffic via the Arctic is much closer than via the Antarctic.

(5) The Atomic Bomb

The atomic bomb has changed the entire world's strategic geography and threatens the civilization of all mankind. But this is not just a problem of loss of life, because the Black Death in the 14th century destroyed a third of the entire population of Western Europe, and it was not seen to curb European civilization thereafter. But the atomic bomb is different. Its destructive impact is mainly the long failure to restore the ordered life of mankind, so that civilization remains for a long time at a stationary point that is difficult to advance. We must understand that the cities that are currently the most densely populated, the most industrialized, and therefore the most vulnerable to atomic bombs, are also the leaders of today's world civilization.

(6) The Clash of Ideas

The result of every major war makes us feel that it is a failure of one political system and a victory of another political system. This war is clearly a failure of the German and Italian dictatorships and a victory of Western democratic and liberal politics. But as we say this, we cannot help but feel a contradiction: the Soviet Union is a country with a completely totalitarian system, in other words, it is another type of dictatorship. Currently, in large areas of Europe, the atmosphere of political freedom has disappeared, and one-party dictatorship is on the rise again. On the one hand, there is the totalitarian ideology of Marxism, and on the other hand, there is the liberal ideology of the middle class. These two trends form one of the most important psychological conflicts in the world today.

(7) The Need to Change

It is not easy to stop the spread of this totalitarian trend, because the people of the world need a thorough change in social and economic order, and this is an undeniable fact. For a long time, our culture has been built on poverty and inequality, but currently, due to human control over natural resources, this era should be over. Our current problem is how to guide human control over nature towards a correct goal.

### American Liberal Faction Actively Advocates Friendship with the Soviet Union – Translated by Jia Nan from Life Magazine

The postwar foreign policy of the United States, with its significant implications, has become the focus of global attention. Within the United States, opinions on this crucial issue are also sharply divided. The stances of the Truman-Byrnes faction and the Wallace faction differ considerably, even to the point of deep conflict. We can gauge the severity of these conflicts by examining the following facts.

Even before the war ended, American military authorities believed that in this era of rapidly emerging new weapons, the United States must retain its outlying bases in the Atlantic until international organizations could maintain lasting peace. Among these bases, Iceland was considered the most essential. Therefore, in October of last year, we requested a 99-year lease of wartime bases from the Icelandic government, while assuring them that once a comprehensive security mechanism was established within the United Nations, the bases would be transferred to the management of the Allied nations. The Icelandic people are a proud and independent nation, and the American Minister to Iceland, Mr. [Lincoln] MacVeagh, worked diligently to negotiate, ensuring that the proposed lease would not infringe upon Icelandic sovereignty and, to demonstrate goodwill, pledged to help Iceland join the United Nations as a member. By March of this year, an agreement seemed highly promising.

In late March, Secretary of Commerce Wallace suddenly became involved in this international stage, small in scale but large in consequence. He held a press conference, sternly criticizing the continued presence of American troops in Iceland as inappropriate and firmly stating that the Soviet Union would inevitably perceive this action as anti-Soviet. Subsequently, Senator Pepper delivered an important speech, supporting Wallace. In mid-April, a "Conference for Peace" was convened in the auditorium of the Commerce Department, attended by prominent liberals such as Senator Kilgore and Representative Celler. They reiterated that the American plan to establish overseas bases carried aggressive and anti-Soviet implications, vehemently demanding the withdrawal of American troops from Iceland. These developments led the Icelandic government to reconsider establishing bases during peacetime.

Byrnes

### The Wallace Faction's Disorganized Steps

The attitude of the Icelandic people may change again. However, if they remain steadfast, and the day comes when our country needs outlying bases in the Atlantic, then Wallace, Pepper, and their supporters will have reason to regret it. We do not doubt Wallace's noble motives, nor can we assert that the plan to establish overseas bases is definitively correct. However, one point is worth noting: this plan is a policy jointly formulated by the American government, approved by the President and various advisors. Wallace, in an irresponsible manner, interfered in a highly sensitive and important matter, ultimately overturning the policy of his own government. He certainly has the right to express his opinions, but if he cannot convince his colleagues in cabinet meetings, then the only course of action is to resign or remain silent. Wallace did not do this, instead adopting what appears to be an unorthodox approach. From this, we can see how disorganized the steps of American liberalism, as represented by the Wallace faction, have become.

What is the cause of this disarray? The answer is simple: it lies in the liberal faction's attitude toward the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's large-scale experiments in social and economic planning, as well as its inspiring achievements in resisting Germany, have deeply moved the liberal faction's imagination. As the war ended, American liberals had formed an idealized picture of the Soviet Union in their minds.

Unfortunately, the resilient and capable leaders of the Soviet Union are not liberal idealists but realists. Unlike most liberals, they understand that power is the fundamental factor in all politics. After the war ended, they embarked on an expansionist policy. This inevitably makes us wonder if the Soviet Union will ever be satisfied before it has completely controlled Europe and Asia.

### Soviet Realism Is Not Easily Reversed

However, liberals will not judge in this way. They often conflate the realistic aspects of Soviet policy with their imagined, idealized picture of the Soviet Union. Some of them believe that the Soviet Union's "Realpolitik" can be reversed through sincere and loving attitudes; others think that Soviet policies are not necessarily worse than old-style British imperialism, as if a mother were forgiving her children's behavior. We find these painstaking justifications deeply painful, because in 1937, 1938, and 1939, we heard similar arguments. In fact, if a political movement cannot adapt to the needs of the times, it risks losing its power. Our most pressing need is to organize a stable, prosperous, and peaceful world, but those who are unwilling and afraid to face reality head-on cannot achieve anything in this regard. This is the tragedy of American liberalism.

Many people often like to speculate, what policies would President Roosevelt have adopted if he were alive today? In fact, spending too much effort in this area is of little significance, but one point is very clear: Roosevelt, on the one hand, strived to engage with the Soviet Union with sincerity, while on the other hand, maintained the United States' firm stance. We can say that the policies currently being pursued by Secretary of State Byrnes bear traces of Roosevelt's approach. The path currently being taken by the United States in international politics has the following points: (1) Fully supporting the United Nations organization, enabling it to solve various problems in the world; (2) Placing terrible new weapons under the control of the United Nations and implementing disarmament under the guidance of the United Nations; (3) Dealing with the Soviet Union with a firmer attitude, preventing its continuous expansion; (4) Making the greatest efforts to carry out relief and reconstruction work in various parts of the world, because famine and poverty can create political vacuums, inducing the Soviet Union to engage in new adventures. However, one point worth explaining is that the basic content of this thinking is not to go to war with the Soviet Union but to remove the dangers of war, improve the world situation, and allow the United States and the Soviet Union to coexist peacefully. After the Soviet Union's leaders experience this firm policy of the United States, they will understand that competing with the United States is meaningless, and then concentrate on domestic development, and treat all nations of the United Nations equally. Time can eliminate suspicion and dissent, and finally obtain the beautiful fruits of peace.

### India's Independence: The First Major Hurdle Is Overcome

— Translated by Jun Mo from a United Press International Special Feature

Under the guidance and assistance of Great Britain, India is taking its first steps toward independence. There will naturally be many obstacles ahead for the Indian people to overcome in order to truly become masters of their own destiny, but the first major hurdle has finally been overcome. Great Britain sent a cabinet delegation to India, bringing with it a plan drafted by the British government, hoping to guide India step-by-step toward independence. After several discussions with various Indian political parties, the plan has finally been accepted by the major parties, primarily the Indian National Congress (representing Hindus), the Muslim League (representing Muslims), and various princely states. The plan is a moderate transformation in nature, requiring agreement among all parties and classes. In July, all parties will elect representatives to form a constituent assembly. The assembly is scheduled to convene on August 1st to draft a new constitution. Once the new constitution is drafted, it must be sent to London for approval by the House of Commons.

This new constitution must conform to the outline and principles of the British-proposed independence plan, especially ensuring the protection of India's minority groups, particularly the 96 million Muslims. At the same time, the constitution must also stipulate that India should enter into a treaty with Great Britain. In addition, the constitution should also stipulate the formation of a federation, with the federal center responsible for the country's foreign affairs, defense, and transportation, and having the power to collect taxes to fund the aforementioned administration. The federal center should have an executive body to preside over it, and a legislative assembly representing the current British India and the princely states. All powers not belonging to the federal center should remain with the individual states.

This all-India federal center will replace Great Britain as the de facto supreme authority in India. Once the constitution is passed, Great Britain will enter into a permanent defense agreement with India, granting Great Britain certain special rights to protect India and maintain imperial communications. It is currently impossible to estimate how long it will take for the Indian people to draft such a constitution. However, it is not an easy task; due to various difficulties, it may take months or even years to complete.

### Europe's Devastation: People Only Care About Food, Not Politics – Impressions of United Press International Assistant General Manager Ben Clurman's Travels

— Translated by Jun Mo

Today's Europe is tired, hungry, and filled with devastation. Over the past few months, I have traveled all over Europe, and the impression I have gained is that the people of Europe today need food, clothing, shelter, and relief from political tensions. Most people are deeply disappointed by the slow pace of reconstruction. They yearn for the days of pre-war peace and prosperity to return soon. Many hope for a vacation where they can relax in sunny places. Others want to read the books, magazines, and newspapers they have not been able to see for many years. Millions of people have returned to religion. Sales of religious publications have exceeded pre-war levels by three or four times, and churches are packed with worshippers, even in Germany and the Soviet Union. The desire for recreation and entertainment is extremely high. Theaters and entertainment venues are more bustling than ever before. Movie theaters are packed to capacity at every showing. In London and many European countries, theater tickets often need to be reserved two or three months in advance. Any mediocre play can run for a long time and is guaranteed to be sold out. Everyone eagerly anticipates the arrival of new American films. Many countries are still showing old Hollywood movies that are five or even ten years old. People are trying to escape reality everywhere. Europeans today do not think about things like diplomacy. The great power politics of the world have disheartened most people. They would rather think about their own stomachs, the shoes on their feet, and the bread, meat, and potatoes that their families are clamoring for.

Waiting in long lines for trains and buses, workers and civil servants complain that everything is still rationed, and some daily necessities are even scarcer than during the war.

Fortunately, apart from the Netherlands, France, Belgium, Finland, Norway, and other countries, Europe has generally not experienced widespread famine. However, six years of war have affected people's entire lives. Lung disease is alarmingly common, and children in particular are suffering from disease, with mortality rates rising dramatically.

A year ago, everyone feared plagues, bloody civil wars, and widespread strikes. But now, it seems that these may be avoided. On the whole, the situation in Europe may be slightly better than most people had predicted.

### The Atomic Bomb: Is It Really Powerful? A Fair Description of the Test

— Translated by Jun Mo

After the first atomic bomb test at Bikini, many people were quite disappointed, feeling that the power of the atomic bomb did not seem as great as imagined, because most of the ships did not sink, and many of the animals used for the test were still alive. They had hoped that one bomb would explode and create "a vast expanse of whiteness, truly clean." In fact, what is the correct assessment of this test? The following is a fair assessment from Mr. Lindley, a columnist for U.S. News & World Report, who personally inspected the scene.

The assessment of the results of this atomic bomb test must depend on three things: First, to what extent were your prior expectations; second, how closely did you inspect the damage to the ships and animals; and third, how much do you really know about the effects of radiation?

Currently, many reports about the damage are based only on observations made from a distance or from the air shortly after the explosion. They are not yet very clear about radiation and the actual extent of the damage. From the air, the Nevada was still floating on the surface of the water, and many of the palm trees and animals on the ship were still unharmed. All of this was initially disappointing. Even I myself, when I flew over the area after the explosion and saw this scene, could not help but feel disappointed. But when the plane flew lower, and you could clearly see the twisted iron plates and the masts and gun barrels that had been bombed, your confidence in the atomic bomb would be restored considerably. When you left the plane and boarded a small boat to inspect the ships closely, your respect for the atomic bomb would be even stronger.

All of this is just the damage that is visible at a glance. The effects of radiation have not yet been taken into account. These will have to be determined by experts after they have studied the damaged ships and animals. What will be the consequences of radiation exposure on the inside of animals or the human body? To what extent does radiation penetrate the ship's hull, and how does it affect the crew? Because if the crew is injured or killed, the fleet is useless even if it does not sink.

After considering all of these things, we must also remember that this was just one atomic bomb exploding in the air above a large fleet. If more atomic bombs were dropped in a real war, or if they exploded underwater, the situation would of course be very different.

We must especially understand that our cities, houses, and factories are not as strong as warships, which are all made of steel plates. Cities and factories are the ideal targets for atomic bombs. In any case, it is still the most terrifying weapon of destruction that mankind has ever created. We simply cannot imagine what a country would become if it were subjected to a sudden atomic bomb attack.

### Curiosities

1. "Balloon Bombs"

The most inept "new weapon" of this war was probably the "balloon bomb" invented by Japan. They spent 18,000,000 U.S. dollars on research, created 9,000 of them, and launched them to attack the United States. Only 283 reached the northern United States, one of which was picked up by a child in Oregon, who played with it. It exploded, killing six people.

2. Rich People Are Often Stingy

The Maharaja of Hyderabad in India is one of the richest people in the world. His wealth amounts to 2,500,000,000 U.S. dollars, and his annual income, after all expenses, is 15,000,000 U.S. dollars. But he is incredibly stingy. He limits his daily allowance to no more than five dollars, but in fact, he never spends that much each day.

Spring and Autumn

### Saroyan

— Xie Shuiying

Foreword: Hankou is unbearably hot. When I try to write something, before I can write a hundred words, sweat drips onto the paper like raindrops, so I have to put down my pen and read a book, because while reading, I can still use my right hand to fan myself. However, after reading, I want to write something again, to record my thoughts or experiences. I hope to introduce several writers, especially those who became famous during the war. I haven't read much of Saroyan's work, but I admire his spirit of perseverance and struggle the most. – Bingying's postscript

William Saroyan is one of the new American writers. He is only thirty-eight years old this year, but he has become a first-rate American writer. In his plays and novels, he breaks literary conventions. Although his works sometimes inevitably feel crude, they are very elegant in terms of taste. Although he will not follow established rules, he still has his own style.

Saroyan was born in 1908. When he was two years old, his father died, and his family was very poor, so his mother had to send him to an orphanage. It was not until he was seven years old that she found a better job at a cannery and brought Saroyan home again. However, when William was thirteen or fourteen years old, he began to support himself: he worked as a messenger for a telegraph office and as a newspaper reporter. From this time on, he began to write novels. At the age of sixteen, he went to work in his uncle's vineyard, so he was very familiar with the life there. Later, he often used it as the background in his novels. The following year, he left home and went to other places.

In many of Saroyan's articles, he reflects on his childhood. He brings the realities of society onto his stage, such as rural areas, cafes in New York, small towns in the West, and even the deserts. In the novel "Locomotive 38," he describes the story of his youth and a wealthy man, which is very interesting. Saroyan has always chosen this simple and beautiful background as the basis for his writing. This is of course due to his keen observation and his ability to see through the entire society. He does not pay attention to how to polish or refine his work, but he has a unique, unadorned beauty that is vivid and profound.

His first collection of novels, "The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze," was highly praised by the literary world. Since the publication of this work, his reputation has grown. In 1939, he began to write plays. His first play was "My Heart's in the Highlands," in which he expressed the success of democracy. Later, he wrote many plays, and "The Human Comedy" has already been made into a movie.

His play "The Time of Your Life?" written in 1939, aroused much praise and won the Pulitzer Prize for Literature, but he openly refused to accept the prize, his reason being that "Businessmen have no right to subsidize literature."

Saroyan never formally attended school, but he eventually achieved great literary success through his talent and his efforts. When the war broke out, he did not hesitate to join the military and work. Years of combat life overseas have given him more writing material. Let's wait and read his new works. Written on July 25th in Hankou.

### Concerning the Musicality of Poetry

— Zhou Tianmu

—Tone and Sentiment—

Regarding the influence of musical sentiment, American professors Farnsworth and Bemont conducted an experiment. They had a group of art students listen to two different melodies without announcing the titles. Afterwards, they asked the students to draw the imagery they received on paper. As a result, no two students drew the same or similar scenes. However, within these diverse scenes, they found a unifying element: sentiment. When the music was melancholic and mournful, the paintings were somber; when the music was light and joyful, the paintings were bright. This applies to music, but in fact, every artistic work radiates a certain sentiment, only expressed in different ways. How does poetry, the essence of all literary forms, express and cultivate its sentiment? Can it, like music, appeal to the sense of hearing through tone and thus infect the listener?

This is the question of the musicality of poetry.

Originally, poetry and song were intertwined. They were expressions of emotion revealed in moments of high excitement or extreme sorrow. This was song, and it could also be called poetry. The two were inseparable, with no clear distinction. Their separation came later. Therefore, poetry undoubtedly originated from music (referring to the unified form of poetry and song). Expressionist aestheticians believed that music and language had the same origin, with the vocal cords being the most primitive instrument. The same vocal cords produce different tones in anger and joy, and the sentiments felt by the listener also differ. The Englishman Spencer said, "Music is a glorified language." He believed that emotion could affect the contraction and expansion of muscles, and changes in muscle contraction and expansion would affect the strength, fineness, pitch, and depth of the tone. According to him, instrumental music evolved from vocal music. Therefore, we can confidently say that the tool of poetry is the tone of language—musical sounds with meaning—poetry is a form of music, or at least it has a strong musicality. It gives listeners a fixed sentiment in the same way as instrumental music. And it immerses them in its specially crafted atmosphere.

How can the tone of poetry convey emotion like musical sounds? In the past, scholars could only explain this through psychological changes (not behavioral psychology). Modern positivist aestheticians can now use various instruments to measure the impact of tone on blood circulation and heart rate. The research report of Foster and Gembel states: "Breathing while listening to music flows the same way as breathing during normal work, but breathing is regular during normal work, and breathing is irregular while listening to music." Mentz found that when the tone is completely harmonious, when the intensity of the sound suddenly changes, or when a piece of music is about to end, the speed of blood flow slows down. Ha. M. Hede conducted even more detailed research and obtained evidence that melancholic tones slow down blood flow, while joyful tones speed up blood flow. This is an explanation of how poetry uses various tones to tap the listener's eardrums, which are then transmitted to the central nervous system, causing corresponding changes in physiology and psychology, and thereby producing the same emotions as the poet, arousing the same "impulse." This "internal imitation" in physiology is the driving force that makes people feel majestic when listening to sonorous and rapid tones, and feel depressed when listening to dark and low tones.

In music, the ancient Greeks considered E major to be stable, D major to be passionate, B major to be mournful, G major to be impetuous, and F major to be licentious. Italian scholars also used the minor second interval of harmony to express sorrow, grief, and doubt, and the major third interval to express joy, courage, confidence, and longing. The minor sixth interval expresses desolation and stillness... Music expresses emotions through the alternating strength, pitch, speed, and slowness of these sounds. Although the syllabic scales of poetry cannot be as fixed as musical notes, it is absolutely certain that it uses tone to convey emotion in the same way as music.

However, poets are not as fortunate as musicians. The sounds used by musicians fill every corner of the universe. These sounds have been accurately calculated by physicists, and the rules of syllables have been organized into a perfect tool. Musicians only need to use this ready-made tool to create, without having to worry about the art itself. But the poet's tool is merely the chaotic and unregulated, messy and clumsy everyday spoken language. It is mixed, rough, and clumsy. It is no wonder that Paul Valéry lamented: "Poets are pitiful. Poets must search from trivial and disordered nouns, and from various rules and illogical laws inherited from the past. These rules and laws are merely created, interpreted, and annotated arbitrarily by someone or many people occasionally as they please."

For the content and form of poetry, scholars have had many heated debates, but in any case, to say that poetry can stand without tone (including rhythm, rhyme, etc.) is as absurd as saying that a beautiful piece of music can be composed from a sound without pitch, strength, length, or duration. Mr. Zhu Guangqian strongly criticized Dr. Hu Shi's theory, created during the May Fourth Movement, that poetry does not need rhyme. In fact, poetry is neither a purely formal game championed by Spencer, nor something that can excessively emphasize content at the expense of form, as advocated by Dr. Hu Shi. In his article "The Principle of Poetry," Hagiwara Sakutaro argued that "The characteristic of poetry is not necessarily the presence or absence of formal rules, nor the presence or absence of free verse. Its expression is related to whether its essence is 'emotional image'—if the meaning expressing emotion is indeed 'emotional image,' then language must use 'emotional language' equipped with all the emotional elements such as rhythm, tone, and voice." This also explains that content determines form, rather than fundamentally despising form. Content creates form, and form completes content. Without technical cultivation to create a beautiful form to match, even with a heart full of passion, it cannot be expressed. We do not need to talk about theory in a vacuum. Let's look at our current poetry scene. The output of poetry is the highest. Editors' drawers are filled with poetry. There are good poems, but most are just disgusting monsters, neither donkey nor horse. This is the reality produced by the atmosphere of not paying attention to (perhaps paying attention to) form or even abandoning form. As Kata Kagei said, "The form and content of poetry are like the water of a river and its banks." At present, our country's poetic language is like the Yellow River changing its course from the old canal to the new canal. Under the impact of the surging river (isn't the stimulus and emotional heat brought to us by the movement of the great era surging enough?), the collapsing new canal cannot match the power of the water flow, so it overflows the embankment and floods everywhere, making it unbearable to clean up. The so-called poetry is all prose written in separate lines. It is a refuge for all novels, Yue operas, reportage, biographies, etc. This prosaicization of poetry is a bankruptcy phenomenon in the poetry world. How to adjust it? I remember that at a literary and art evening, Mr. Li Jianwu shouted loudly for a revolution in form. In poetry, it is necessary to revolutionize the prosaicization of poetry. Poetry is poetry, and prose is prose. They should not be mixed together. The difference between the two lies in tone, and tone is the family treasure of poetry. It is the lifeline of poetry. Who says that rules (of course, not referring to fixing things like level tones and oblique tones as shackles, and calling new rules new shackles?)

After the May Fourth Movement, most metrical poets admired the poetry of French masters. They put a lot of effort into the selection of language tones. However, later, in the hands of the decadent poets who pursued sensory enjoyment, rhyme went into a dead end. It cannot be said that the reaction of the prosaicization of poetry today has nothing to do with this.

Now, fortunately, the pursuit of poetic language is showing a thriving atmosphere again. This is indeed a gratifying scene. Isn't the recitation of poetry and song prevailing? And various dialects are also being tested and refined. For example, using the Wu dialect of Shanghai to translate French poems, and some people using the Ningbo dialect to recite translated poems by Rilke. Other dialects from Sichuan, Yangzhou, Shanghai, etc. are also being tested and explored. This bold attempt is right. Ai Qing once said, "Poets must take risks to create language, just like pearl divers struggling in the entanglement of seaweed in order to pick pearls, diving deep to the bottom of the sea." Not a single true poet is not constantly looking for appropriate language and putting emotion on it, firing outward. To make "it silence us with a charming monotony, and at the same time keep us awake with various changes, it places us in that truly ecstatic state, in which the soul is freed from the pressure of the will and is revealed in symbols" (W. B. Yeats). To make the listener intoxicated in the sentiment of the poem, this is when the tone of the poem is best intertwined with the inner meaning, it is the exquisiteness of poetry, it is the peak of poetic art, and it is also what poets dream of pursuing all their lives.

### Sketch of Self-Cultivating Farmer Huang Changgui in Prison

— Yao Falcon

That self-cultivating farmer Huang Changgui has been living here for more than two years. His crime is "murder," but in reality, he has never killed anyone, but was implicated by others, and was wrongly sentenced to life imprisonment.

He is only twenty-nine years old this year, with a short and sturdy figure, a shaved head, and a fleshy face with two thick black inverted eight-character eyebrows. His slightly swollen eye sockets contain a pair of dull eyes, a round nose, thick lips, and a sluggish expression on his face. He wears a set of broken cotton clothes borrowed from the prison authorities.

If you ask him if he really killed someone, he will say affirmatively in an angry tone: "I didn't kill anyone! If I had killed him, it would have been worth it. That guy was a head of the baojia system, very bad, and no one didn't hate him."

Sitting in prison for a long time is a terrible thing. All of his family property was spent on this lawsuit. Originally, he had a wife who was only twenty years old, and had been married for four or five years, but had not had any children. Last year, after his case was sentenced, his wife remarried. He got four thousand yuan, and also ate it all up in this prison. Now he has no support from outside, only a married poor older sister who occasionally comes to visit him once or twice when she comes to the city. Asked why he let his wife remarry, he said: "She wanted to marry someone, what could I do? I don't know when I will be able to get out, do you want her to live a widow?" After a pause, he went on to describe his wife's appearance: "A pockmarked face, squinty eyes, a limp... looks three parts unlike a human, four parts unlike a ghost!" Obviously, he deliberately described her so ugly to make fun of himself. In fact, this was of course a big blow to him. He sighed and said: "The family she is married to now is not bad..."

In this prison, he seems optimistic on the surface, and you can often hear his laughter—he has such a laughing temperament, that anything can cause him to burst into laughter, and laugh so loudly, so violently, as if he is using all his strength to laugh intently. One day, he didn't know what he thought of, and told people: "If I dressed up as a woman and was locked in the women's cell, it would be a good show!" As he said this, he laughed violently again, laughing so hard that his waist bent over. Therefore, the inmates here often look for opportunities to tease him to laugh. At first, he was just laughing alone, but after a while, everyone was infected and formed a burst of laughter, and his high-pitched laughter surpassed all the surrounding laughter, like a highest note in a choir, leading this chorus. Often we were intoxicated in this laughter, temporarily forgetting the sorrow in the prison.

Often, he makes straw sandals or pastes paper cigarette boxes in this prison. Because of this work, he can receive an extra four taels of coarse rice for each meal, and a hundred or so yuan of bonus money each month, as pocket money for adding dishes here. On days when there is no work to do, he takes on cleaning and other small errands for the wealthy inmates here, and they give him leftovers as compensation. Because his appetite is very large, the two daily prison rations are not enough for him to eat.

His expenses here are very frugal, and he doesn't even smoke cheap tobacco. But he bought twenty yuan of rough-edged paper, bound a notebook, and asked the inmates to copy things like the "Thousand Character Classic" for him to read. In this prison, the atmosphere of reading is very strong. Because they have been sued, they have to come into contact with the black characters on white paper, such as "indictments," "judgments," "rulings," and "defense statements," "appeals," etc. These are a series of troublesome things that are closely related to everyone and can determine their fate. Therefore, after entering the prison, people tasted the disadvantage of being illiterate. At the same time, because of the busyness of life outside, many people did not have the opportunity to study. Reading and literacy has become the best way to pass the time, and it is also very convenient to ask people for advice. Entering this prison, you can see that this is like a cram school. People are reading and writing in groups of two or three. Everyone recognizes a few words more or less after going to jail.

When he has nothing to do, he holds that handwritten notebook, forcibly memorizing one word at a time. When he can't remember, he hits his head and curses: "Damn it, can't remember it!" Or he takes a few sheets of rough paper and copies the words crookedly, stopping from time to time to suck on the tip of the pen, getting his mouth full of ink, smiling foolishly, like a naughty schoolboy in a private school.

Sometimes, he lies on the bed all day without saying a word, just sighing and saying: "Prison is hard to sit!" At this time, if you ask him why he doesn't read, he replies lazily: "No energy!"

Because his case was before 1943, after one commutation, he was resentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment. Now, the amnesty order has been promulgated again, and I pray that he can regain his freedom soon. July 1946 in Shanghai.

### Shutting the Door in Wind and Rain

— Xie Zi

When sick in bed, I prefer wind and rain to the sun. Seeing the misty and desolate scene of wind and rain outside through the hazy glass window, I have a kind of satisfaction. This satisfaction is almost selfish—I feel lonely myself, and I hope the world will not be too lively either. In order to avoid jealousy of the prosperity of the world, in order to avoid the troubles of many uninvited guests, the continuous wind and rain appear particularly intimate. All the unsatisfactory and annoying things are hidden in this desolate world. At this time, lying quietly in bed and closing the door, there is a feeling of peace in my heart.

Some time ago, I went from Hong Kong to Shanghai and spent three days on the boat. During the three days, I sometimes ran to the deck to see the sea, and sometimes lay in the cabin chatting. The air cylinder on the wall was like a funnel, blowing the vast sea breeze outside into the small hole, which was very cold. A boat drifted on the sea, and the whole world, the pain and troubles, joys and sorrows of the world, were all separated by the ocean. Lying silently in the cabin, there was a carefree satisfaction, as if it was a vacation from life.

Some people don't like this kind of vacation. Every moment of their lives is pre-arranged. They need to step into the bustling world at all times. On rainy days, they can't wear the most beautiful clothes, can't wear the cleanest shoes, open the door and see the rain and wind raging, and have to put on a raincoat, put on that awkward hat, and walk carefully, hailing a car on the street... They hate all these annoying and trivial things. There are also some people who can stay at home, but insist on finding some excuses to go out and play, but it is raining, and they run to the window from time to time to look out, hoping that the wind and rain will stop soon. For these people, the savor of shutting the door in wind and rain will never be appreciated.

Modern people's lives seem too cramped, so cramped that there is no room for leisure. Stealing leisure from busyness, getting sick seems to be the best and only excuse. But lying in bed, if the weather is good, you can't help but see the dazzling sunlight, and you can't help but hear the bustling city sounds. So there is a feeling of desolation being neglected, and annoyance of being abandoned by happiness. At this time, how much I hope the weather will change suddenly—the room is full of cool wind, and the sky is full of wind and rain. Even though I am in the ward, it is as if it is the small boat of Adam fleeing in the past!

I often think that when a person of advanced age no longer hopes to compete in this world, and already regards pain and happiness as the same, it would be such a wise thing to title his study "Shutting the Door in Wind and Rain"! He is separated from this world, but he has not left it. He can watch this world in stillness, watching the pain and troubles, sorrows and joys of this world; watching the disturbances of this world. When it really rains, he can't help but be busy, hurrying to close the windows, but forgetting the door. The big characters on the door, "Shutting the Door in Wind and Rain Studio," may have been blown away by the wind and rain.

### Madonna and Child

— Painted by Botticelli (1444-1510)

Displayed at the National Gallery in London

Botticelli was once famous during his lifetime, but was soon forgotten by the world. It was not until the Victorian era (19th century), the so-called "New Renaissance," that great talents emerged in art and literature, and Botticelli's greatness was rediscovered. This picture "Madonna and Child" is one of Botticelli's masterpieces. The Madonna sits quietly in front of the window, making people immediately recall her young age. It is said that the Madonna was only fourteen years old when she gave birth to Jesus, so the Madonna in the picture should also be no more than fifteen. Botticelli made us beautifully recall her youth, and gave her a kind of sad sweetness in her appearance, which moved all later generations who saw it. Her hair and headdress are all bright golden, according to this is one of the characteristics of Botticelli's works, because Botticelli was a goldsmith in his early years.

### Today This Year

— Xuehua

Last year today, I was like a little trapped beast, hiding in a cold and desolate little room. A friend came to see me. I stretched out a yellow, weary arm and embraced her, excitedly saying:

"Friend, I'm neglecting you today, but if I'm still alive next year on this day, I will decorate my doors and windows with amorous golden gauze, make beautiful tablecloths with tender yellow soft silk, insert red fresh flowers into green vases, and spray fragrant lily dew into every corner. Ah, friend! At that time, I will invite you here to drink a glass of wine with me, to celebrate the passing of the dark night, the arrival of the light, and the radiant flames of freedom and happiness shining upon the world! Oh, friend, do you think that day will ever come?"

My friend smiled slightly and replied, "Of course!"

Life is a cloud of undirected mist, and what propels the cloud of mist is an elusive fantasy!

I dare not say I fully believe this sentence, but I have indeed spent my lonely childhood and solitary youth in fantasy; and I have indeed spent many desolate years in fantasy.

Last year today, how could I not worry that my hope would be like a beautiful soap bubble, about to burst in an instant? And how could I not worry that my friend's smile would be like a wisp of sunset in the west, about to disappear in the blink of an eye? Yet I still clung to the hope of a "what if": ——

What if my fantasy became reality! What if my friend's "of course" could be realized! …

"I cannot be pessimistic, I must expect!" I encouraged myself in this way, comforted myself. And so, a year quickly passed.

Today this year, I am still alive, and my friend has come to my cold and desolate little room again.

Where is the golden gauze? Where is the tender yellow soft silk? Where are the red flowers, fragrant dew, and fine wine? And where are the light, freedom, and happiness? … Did I deceive her, or did she deceive me? We are all at a loss.

"Don't be disappointed, look forward to today next year!" Holding my icy hand, my friend still tried to struggle.

"Yes, look forward to today next year!" I also still wanted to struggle.

But in the end, we both burst into tears! —— Oh, the pitiful lies! Today this year, what courage do we still have to imagine today next year?

### Spider Silk

— Shaofu

A friend of mine used to work at the Kai Zao Coal Mine. He told me many scenes of the mine, one of which was a strange experiment of his. He said, "The mine shafts go deep underground, which is another world. The various insects that we don't usually see or have never seen are 'commonplace' and not surprising to the miners. Because of this environment, I suddenly thought of doing an experiment one Dragon Boat Festival to test which of these many insects was the fiercest and most poisonous.

I found a large washbasin and a large piece of glass to cover it. After a lot of effort, I caught geckos, scorpions, centipedes, snakes, bees, water insects, spiders, and many other unknown small animals, and put them all in this washbasin.

It was truly a spectacle, the most intense and thrilling scuffle, biting, chasing, jumping, twisting, and struggling, each using all its strength. In the intermittent battle of a few hours, I watched with bated breath, but what particularly interested me was the spider, about the size of a thumb. From beginning to end, the tactic it adopted was to dodge and avoid direct conflict with any insect. However, while fleeing, it desperately spun silk, weaving its web continuously. People may not believe it, but the weapon created by its tiny body spread across most of the washbasin, and the result was predictable. The others were either on the verge of death or exhausted, one by one being bound in its web, while it, this thumb-sized spider, sat leisurely in a remote corner of the web, looking a bit tired, but also pleased with the abundance of its harvest!

The next few days were days for it to slowly enjoy itself, eating them alive and dead, until they were all consumed."

What does this story bring us?

Is it the power of that extremely fine and delicate spider silk?

Are there any other inspirations? We can all slowly chew on it!

### Recent Events in Wu Yuan

— Bailian

The Chang Dong'e case was publicly tried a few days ago (22nd). Yu and Huang, the two section chiefs, seemed steady as Mount Tai as they attended the trial. Chang Dong'e's mother cried loudly in court, scolding Yu and Huang as "two killers." She also said that when the property was sealed, there were only three and a half rooms in her house, but as many as twenty-eight sealing strips were affixed. Another interesting thing happened in court: when the lawyer hired by Yu and Huang tried to speak, he was stopped by the prosecutor, and the audience burst into loud hisses. There were more than two hundred people attending the trial, and the people of Suzhou were all watching closely. However, the "Xin Su Daily Evening Post," published on the same day, carried the results of the trial, stating that the prosecutor needed Chang Dong'e's mother to collect evidence of Yu and Huang's corruption and bribery before the trial could be resumed. Public opinion in all circles seems to be very dissatisfied with this move. The Suzhou Chang Dong'e case support group has proposed other suggestions, perhaps because the prosecutor's request for Chang'e's mother to collect evidence of Yu and Huang's bribery is excessively forced and seems to favor them!

An epidemic is prevalent in Suzhou, and welcoming god ceremonies appear one after another. These ceremonies show a grand display of instruments, but the waste is particularly serious. Embroidered banners and barefoot performers are all covered in bright costumes, shouting loudly. There are also "living lamps" in the ceremonies, where steel needles are densely pierced into the arms, tied with red ropes, and then small scenery or steel rings are tightly fastened below. Some even bind entire candlesticks weighing two or three hundred catties on top, causing the arm flesh to droop down, the state being extremely cruel. And they are mostly children around the age of twelve, the mystery of which is truly beyond the ability of outsiders to glimpse. It is said that each ceremony costs more than thirty or forty million yuan, which makes everyone click their tongues. Yesterday, the party headquarters and the two county governments stopped it, but today it is said that another group has appeared, ordering them to submit a document. The ignorant people are truly impossible to teach.

Suzhou's drama scene only has one Golden Star Theater; Chen Baicheng's play "An Official's Image" is currently being performed, and the box office is extremely prosperous. Golden Star 2 is as small as a pigeon cage, and it is very hot, but every show is full, and the performance is excellent. Did the previous two plays at "Golden Star" lose tens of millions? Since the performance of "An Official's Image," the losses have been recovered and there is a slight surplus. "An Official's Image" has been performed for about a month and a half, directed by Wu Chen, i.e. Wei Yu. The performances are all copied from the old Shanghai style, only the "theft" character hanging in the center of the lamp is changed to "honesty." The five-yuan and ten-yuan small denomination banknotes issued by the Four Banks are rejected by shops in the market, and many banks also refuse to accept them for deposit, using the difficulty of counting as an excuse. People also do not carry them when shopping, and they have become "waste" in an invisible way. The county chamber of commerce once announced that all shops should accept them, but the result is still waste paper. Currently, only the post office can use them to buy stamps, but even that is limited to a small amount, and larger amounts are rejected. Hong Junyun, the manager of the Suzhou branch of the Siming Bank, will launch a "Small Money Relief Campaign" to use these small denomination banknotes to relieve the victims of the disaster in northern Jiangsu, which is being submitted to the authorities for instructions. This move should also be a win-win situation!

### Increased Troops in Macau

— Fang Jun

Macau is under Portuguese rule, and historically it is only a vague basis, but this has been going on for many years, even longer than the Hong Kong of the Treaty of Nanjing. But this small place seems to not attract much attention in political diplomacy, but although the place is not very important, it is still a most adverse influence on the Guangdong people, especially the people of Zhongshan County. This is of course in its colonial policy, which is greatly contrary to our domestic politics. Therefore, for many years, perhaps since it has had its own territory, it has been nothing more than a refuge for Chinese thugs, except for opium, gambling and prostitution.

However, this place has been ignored by Chinese politics, and the people seem to treat it like an insignificant thing, or regard it as a garbage can, and many people do not look at it directly.

Recently, it has suddenly increased its troops, and many weapons have also arrived. This batch of reinforcements is more than a thousand black soldiers, transferred from Timor Island, which is the Portuguese regular army guarding Timor Island, so the equipment is still complete. It is just unclear what the intention is. The Macau government has not stated the reason for this increase in troops. What we have learned from the news reports is that after this batch of troops arrived, the old soldiers were changed to police. Then, the power of the police has also been strengthened as a result.

What kind of threat has Macau been subjected to that has led to increased defense? Is it because there are Chinese troops stationed in Qianshan? Chinese troops have always been stationed in Qianshan, but they have always been few in number, and they have no intention or intention towards Macau, and the task of the Chinese troops is not here. The Macau government should not be so alarmed. Then, what facts does it have as a basis for increasing troops? Except for the Portuguese government, no one else knows!

Some people think that the United States wants to lease Luwan as an airport, and the Macau government plans to build an iron bridge from the Jia Silan Fortress to connect with Luwan, so they increase troops first to strengthen defense. This is not a reason, and it cannot be used as a basis for facts. Because if the United States wants to lease Luwan, it has to ask the Chinese government. The Portuguese do not have this right to lease, and there is no need for them to increase troops for defense. Others think that it is to protect two tycoons, Gao Kening and Fu Laorong, that they do not hesitate to mobilize troops. This sounds like the Portuguese have a reason. The reason is that those two Chinese traitors are the Macau government's gods of wealth. Gao Kening and others have long been closely protected, not only are their exits and entrances followed by armed Portuguese police, but their residences are also specially equipped with six lines of defense. But this is superfluous, perhaps it is just the Macau government's own meddling. When the Chinese government issues a document requesting extradition, who is afraid that he will not hand over the two men? Therefore, I think even this is not a factual basis for the Macau government. (According to a report last month, the United States has already given up on the Guan Jian airport matter).

Then why did the Portuguese government increase troops in Macau? Is there another international war in the Far East? Was Macau only threatened by war after the Japanese surrendered? The Macau government cannot but make an explanation. (July 23rd.)

### Freedom of Speech

— Chongwu

An American soldier and a Red Army soldier were discussing their governments in Berlin. The American soldier said to the Red Army soldier, "You can go to the White House in Washington to see President Truman, wait for him to get up, and then raise your finger in front of the president and criticize Truman's good and bad points."

The Red Army soldier said, "You can go to the Kremlin to see Marshal Stalin, wait for him to get up, and then point your finger in Marshal Stalin's face."

### Tomorrow Never Comes

— You Fu

I borrowed a book from a friend, and she readily agreed. Because of my urgent need, I urged her every day. After urging her for two weeks, I still didn't get the book. Her answer to me was always "tomorrow."

After getting this result, I never mentioned it to her again. If I asked her again, it would be really embarrassing. It's as if I'm not borrowing a book, but demanding a debt from her. Fortunately, I'm not a debt collector, otherwise, I would go to collect the debt on New Year's Eve, so that she would have no way to answer "tomorrow."

Now, I have deeply realized that the common people's faults are not being punctual, procrastination, and laziness. As long as there is a minute or a second, they try to delay it as much as possible.

Fortunately, God has created a natural "tomorrow" in the universe for people to use, otherwise, those who often break their promises will have no room for retreat.

I remember in a certain organization in Chengdu, ten minutes before get off work, the director of the office received an official document. Because he was eager to go home to eat dinner and accompany his wife to see a movie, he thought to himself, "Anyway, there are only ten minutes left before get off work, why not deal with it tomorrow?" So, he hurriedly took the file home. The next day, he forgot to bring the file to the office and left it at home, so the third day, the fourth day... it was still left at home for two months.

Unexpectedly, not long after, the superior ordered an investigation into this file. After searching back and forth, they couldn't find it. He was so anxious that he had to issue an emergency order to the secretary and all the section chiefs: "Investigate immediately." After investigating back and forth, they still couldn't find it. He was furious and reprimanded the secretary in official jargon. The secretary reprimanded the section chief in official jargon, and the section chief reprimanded the staff in official jargon, but there was still no result. After a few days, it was suddenly discovered in his son's hands. It turned out that his son was very naughty and had no paper for making kites, so he took this file to paste the kite as he pleased. It was really whimsical. After he saw it, he was speechless with anger and could only confess his guilt to the superior. The superior believed that this matter was no small matter, "negligence of duty delaying military affairs" and immediately dismissed him.

There was another time, also in Chengdu, in a military education institution, one evening on a day off, a student suffered from acute appendicitis. He was carried to the hospital to see a doctor. Coincidentally, a duty soldier called the president of the institution, and the reply was: "Today is a holiday, and it's late, so send him to the ward first, and I'll take care of it for him tomorrow." The duty soldier followed the order and sent the patient to the ward, but when the president came the next morning, the student had already died.

Tomorrow and tomorrow, tomorrow never comes, but striving for timeliness and cherishing every inch of time is the key to all success!

### "Too Wordy" Confucius Scolds Zhu Xi

— Suobei

A Ku Ling dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 28th, Mr. Jiang Menglin once told reporters a joke: Zhu Xi saw Confucius and wrote on his business card "Disciple Zhu Xi bows a hundred times," adding a note: "Zhu is the surname, Xi is the name, disciple is a student, a hundred bows are a hundred times of kowtowing." Confucius looked at it and exclaimed "Wordy!"

There is more to this joke, supplemented as follows:

After Zhu Xi heard Confucius exclaim wordy, he added a note: "Wordy means troublesome." Confucius impatiently said: "Too wordy!" Zhu Xi then added a note: "Too means a further level, wordy see the previous note."

### The Story of Wireless Facsimile

— Zuowei

The invention of phototelegraphy dates back to 1924 AD. At that time, the telegraph bureau in Cleveland, USA, used wires to transmit several landscape photos of Lake Erie to New York. Forty-four minutes later, the first phototelegraph in history appeared in the New York Times. Therefore, phototelegraphy has been developed for a full twenty-two years.

Since then, after ten years of experiments and research, it has been formed on a certain scale; but the same: London sent a photo of King George V, and it felt very blurry after receiving it. After careful observation, they felt very strange; what was the gray mark like a medal on the upper part of the King's left waist? What was even stranger was that his chin was like a child's. It turned out that his famous and beloved beard had disappeared. Finally, the matter was cleared up. Because during the transmission process, a part of the machine turned suddenly, so it accidentally moved the sideburns to the waist. This small setback prompted scientists to work hard to improve and finally achieve the greatest success.

In this war, wireless phototelegraphy exerted its highest efficiency and achieved unparalleled merit. Most cities such as Stockholm, Moscow, Lisbon, Cairo, Istanbul, Kunming, Chongqing, Paris, Brussels, and small cities in Africa also have this receiving equipment to transmit real news messages by means of phototelegraphy.

Speaking of China having this equipment, there is also a very interesting thing: in 1942, a meaningful historical document was transmitted from China to Los Angeles. This was a Chinese letter from President Chiang to President Roosevelt congratulating the successful radio photographic communication between China and the United States; at that time, the US naval authorities and journalists were at a loss, and no one could translate it. Finally, at 2 am, they searched all over Chinatown in Los Angeles and found a Chinese person, who happily recited it. What was exciting was not only this, but also the amazing development of the motherland's communication work.

Since the invention of phototelegraphy, it has been widely used:

A heart patient living in New Jersey City on the Atlantic coast transmitted two charts of heart rate to a heart specialist in Chicago. One hour later, the patient had received a return telegram of the doctor's diagnosis.

General James of the United States transmitted a photograph of a one thousand dollar check from London. The trust department of the New York bank received it within a few minutes and immediately cashed it. The New York Police Department caught a suspect. When his fingerprints were transmitted to the Chicago Police Department, they looked up the files for comparison. Within a few minutes, the evidence of the crime was established, making it impossible for the criminal to quibble.

The various cruel and brutal atrocities in the Nazi concentration camps during the war were almost unbelievable until radio photography faithfully recorded and disseminated the situation, and everyone was convinced.

When everyone was doubting Mussolini's death, phototelegraphy had already transmitted the ugly state of the Devil lying in Milan, overthrowing all rumors and lies.

This is the "electric eye" of the people of the twentieth century!

### Celibacy and Chastity

— Wang Ling

The meanings of celibacy and chastity can be said to be completely different. The former is a perpetual, organized suppression of love; while the latter is a perpetual, organized suppression of sexual desire.

Therefore, so-called chastity is not the negation of love, but the preparation for love. This is indeed an act and ideal of exploring love and hoping to obtain the qualification for love, and it is a problem that young men and women cannot but study and explore deeply. Because chastity is one of the noblest morals of youth. The importance of chastity has been discussed repeatedly by those who care about the issue of love today, but still without results.

Needless to say, this is because their explanations are confused with celibacy. Celibacy is a distortion of life, one of the intellectual and moral diseases of life. The origin of the ideal of celibacy is extremely easy to explain. When mankind was at a certain stage of development, opened its mind, and a life of altruism and sympathetic imagination was reflected in the minds of some people. In ordinary language, it is that mankind discovered its own spiritual nature. But what is the usual state? Everything outside suppresses that nature, attempting to bury it in the soil. Among those destructive forces, the strongest is sex. When the power of sex is activated, it will completely fail to understand the higher ideals of mankind, and only feed on mankind for its own convenience. When it shows its power, it will take away money, health, time, reputation, and everything else from mankind. The world's wise men, old Flaubert, and Bacon, once said such a sentence: "To marry and have children is to shackle one's own limbs." Bacon fled to the Sahara in order to discover that this evil spirit lived in his own spirit. He hid in a cave, starved and refused food, and allowed insects and wind to invade at will. He only wanted to eradicate the sexual impulse burning in his body.

The construction of monasteries and convents, and religious cultivation, have the same starting point. This idea of ​​seeing sexual relations as evil and depraved, even permeates the minds of modern people, in all aspects such as literature, social inheritance, and law, hindering the true understanding of love, and preventing the path to health and happiness through love.

The ideal of celibacy is an intellectual and moral disease, a desecration of nature. Nature has poured all its power into breaking it, and finally succeeded.

Celibacy also has another form, which is not due to religious concepts, but originates from economic reasons. It carries a purely selfish nature, without organizational or theoretical basis. In the form of shouting "single life", a system of old and young prostitution has been generated. Regardless of whether the reason is family education or economic, in short, any form of celibacy cannot be consistent with chastity that recognizes love and respects love. Chastity is the preparation for love, but if love is prohibited due to laws, social inheritance, or economic oppression, then so-called chastity or virginity will be transformed into the fantasy of idealists.

### Meal Expenses and Academic Credits

— From the Party Department

Let me report on two matters:

Our school, because it is located in the eastern suburbs of Shanghai, almost all students are boarders. Meal expenses are paid monthly. The third installment of meal expenses before the end of the last semester, because the final exams were approaching, and students were studying on campus, they were unable to go home to get money. Therefore, the school authorities issued a notice in the hall:

"It has been resolved by the school affairs committee that those who do not pay the third installment of meal expenses will not have any of their academic credits earned this semester counted. Do not complain. This is a strict notice."

Furthermore, at the end of the semester, a seat reservation fee must be paid according to regulations, but the school authorities stipulated that those who are overdue will have to pay double the seat reservation fee.

Regarding the punishment received for the above two matters, I find it quite interesting to contemplate!
