### The CCP Fails to Fulfill Troop Reorganization Plan, Prospects for Negotiations Dim Again, Representatives of the Three Parties Are Engaging in Compromise

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] Thirteen days have passed since the announcement of the ceasefire, and the ceasefire deadline is noon on the 22nd. Counting the night of the 19th, there are only sixty hours left. On the 19th, this reporter inquired everywhere all day and learned that the peace negotiations have been stalled because the CCP is unwilling to faithfully fulfill the troop reorganization plan, opposes the arbitrator authority of Ambassador Marshall, and demands police power over railway protection in the plan to restore transportation. According to sources close to the CCP, Zhou Enlai is now awaiting a reply from Yan'an. If he receives instructions tonight or at night, he intends to visit Ambassador Marshall to discuss matters at any time.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] It is reported that the government's proposed reorganization and unified編制 plan has clear and reasonable regulations on the areas where the Communist troops are stationed inside and outside the Guan. In the Northeast, the Communist troops are allowed to station three divisions in Qiqihar, Hailanpao, and Yongji. However, in North China, two divisions must be reduced, and the Communist troops must withdraw from Harbin, Rehe, Chahar, and Yantai and Weihaiwei in Shandong. They must also withdraw from Dezhou, Tai'an, Lincheng on the Jinpu Line, and Zaozhuang, Zhangdian, Zhoucun, and Jiaoxian on the Linzao branch line. The CCP's demands for stationed areas include Jilin, Heilongjiang, Rehe, Chahar, and Suiyuan in the Northeast, as well as most of Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces. If this news is accurate, it will be difficult for both parties to reach an agreement due to the great distance between them. According to CCP sources, the CCP is facing a life-or-death crisis.

[Reuters, Nanjing, 19th] The optimism regarding the future of consultations here in the past 24 hours has turned dim again because the Communist Party failed to accept President Chiang's new righteousness regarding troop reorganization and the areas where the Communist troops are stationed in North China and the Northeast.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] This morning, representatives of the Democratic League, Shen Junru, Huang Yanpei, and Zhang Bojun, visited Zhou Enlai. It is reported that the meeting lasted about two hours, but no results were achieved. It is said that Zhou Enlai did not engage in any activities all day.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] Representatives Zeng Qi, Zhang Junmai, Chen Qitian, Mo Dehui, Wang Yunwu, Shen Junru, Yu Jiaju, Zhang Shenfu, Liang Shuming, and others from the Youth Party, the Democratic League, and respected figures from society, gathered at the office of the Youth Party delegation at 4:00 PM on the 19th to discuss the current situation. After a long discussion, they reached the following conclusions: (1) It is hoped that the government will extend the ceasefire negotiation period so that the three issues can be fully agreed upon. (2) It is hoped that the CCP will agree to Marshall's arbitration method in order to truly implement the ceasefire. It is reported that they have also decided to separately invite representatives of the government and the CCP on the 20th to explain the aforementioned opinions.

[United Press, Chongqing, 19th] Minister of Transportation Yu Dawei reiterated today the government's determination to take over Andong, Songjiang, Nenjiang, Heilongjiang, Xing'an, and Dalian after the ceasefire expires. Yu also said: The Communist troops "should be concentrated in areas where there will be no takeover work."

### Hoping the Communist Side Considers the Suffering of the People, Promptly Jointly Promoting an Agreement, Minister Peng Speaks with Foreign Reporters

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] A press conference for foreign reporters was held at 4:00 PM on the 19th in the Executive Yuan's conference room, presided over by Minister Peng Xuepei and Vice Minister Liu Cuo. Premier Song Ziwen also attended. The following is a record of Minister Peng's replies to the main questions:

Question: What is the current situation of the peace negotiations?

Peng replied: In recent days, Ambassador Marshall and representatives of the government have worked diligently, day and night. The plans proposed by the government have strived to be clear and concrete. Unfortunately, the CCP's replies have often been vague. In order to seek a quick solution, the government has continued to make concessions. It is hoped that the CCP will consider the suffering of the people and resolutely decide to jointly promote an early agreement. I hope the Committee of Three can meet in the next few days.

Question: Does the government insist that the Communist side must accept the proposal of arbitration as a prerequisite for a solution?

Peng replied: Any agreement must be effectively implemented within a certain period of time to be of value. In view of past experiences, the Communist side has often delayed, resulting in the indefinite implementation of agreements and the complete cancellation of their effectiveness. Therefore, this time, the government insists on authorizing the American representative with arbitration power in order to achieve a rapid and effective solution. As for the argument that this will damage China's sovereignty, it is a distortion. Historically, disputes between major countries have often been submitted to the Hague Tribunal for arbitration, and the arbitral judges are from third countries, which does not harm the sovereignty of any independent country. The American representative's arbitration is only temporary in nature. In fact, the Executive Headquarters for Military Mediation of the Committee of Three already has an American representative in addition to the government and Communist Party representatives, and they are welcomed and admired by both the government and the Communist Party.

Question: The government's strongholds in Shandong are under serious threat from Communist troops. What is the government's countermeasure in this regard? Is the government currently rushing reinforcements to Shandong by sea and air?

Peng replied: A detailed answer to this question can be found in the government's memorandum to the Executive Headquarters for Military Mediation, which was published in today's newspapers. The number of troops originally stationed by the government in various parts of Shandong was very small, so the Communist troops were able to attack and seize territory without much effort. However, the government cannot stand idly by while important cities such as Jinan and Qingdao are attacked by Communist troops on the outskirts and heavily besieged. Protecting the territory and defending the people is the minimum responsibility of any government. This reinforcement is still defensive in nature for self-defense. The government hopes that the Communist troops will immediately stop the attack and withdraw from the cities that were forcibly occupied after June 7 in order to achieve a peaceful solution.

Question: Is it true that the government has submitted a memorandum of amendment to General Marshall regarding the February 25 agreement? Is the government willing to discuss the amendment of the proportion of troops stationed in the Northeast?

Peng replied: The government's proposal regarding the February 25 agreement stipulates the implementation method of the transportation restoration plan. In order to express its concession, the government has accepted most of the Communist side's demands regarding transportation issues. As for the proportion of troops in the Northeast, the government has also made important concessions to promote a rapid solution.

Question: Is it true that the Communist Party is demanding three ministries in the government, including the Ministry of Interior?

Peng replied: During the 15-day period, both parties focused on discussing the three issues raised in President Chiang's ceasefire order, and did not discuss other issues.

### Guangzhou Announces Alert, Strictly Preventing Communist Troops' Riots

[United Press, Guangzhou, 18th] A spokesman for the Guangzhou Pacification Headquarters announced today that the CCP is attempting to riot in Guangzhou, so the military and political authorities here have to conduct house-to-house searches and announce an alert. More stringent measures may be taken in the future, but residents will feel inconvenienced. At the same time, British Consul Hall and Foreign Ministry Commissioner Guo Dehua went to Hong Kong today to discuss the matter of the National Daily being fined and suspended.

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 18th] The number of CCP armed personnel in Guangdong is about 2,000 on both sides of the Dongjiang River, and they are now concentrated in Dapeng Bay. Wang Zuoyao and other troops of the Beijiang River, about 900 people, are also moving south and are expected to arrive at Dapeng Bay around the 25th.

### Premier Song's Talk Explains Economic Policy

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] Premier of the Executive Yuan Zhu Ziwen attended the Central Propaganda Department's press conference for the first time at 5:00 PM on the 19th and answered the following questions from our reporter in a sincere and clear tone: (1) Question: During the current peace negotiations, I wonder if the Premier has discussed the relationship between the domestic economy, finance, prices, and the people's livelihood, as well as the CCP's indiscriminate issuance of banknotes in various places. Has the government made plans in advance for the future handling of this kind of "resistance currency"? Answer: Once the military, political, and transportation issues negotiated between the government and the CCP are settled, this issue can also be easily resolved. As for the future handling of "resistance currency" and other types of banknotes issued by the CCP that are similar to "resistance currency," it concerns the national economy, and the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance are carefully studying and preparing for it. (2) Question: It is hoped that the Premier will hold a press conference at the Executive Yuan once a week or every two weeks, where the Premier will personally report on the main tasks that have been completed, are pending, or are being planned, and answer reporters' questions so that the people can have a clear understanding of the major national policies. Answer: Because I am busy with my duties and do not engage in publicity, I rarely interact with the outside world. Therefore, those who do not have much contact with my administrative affairs will inevitably feel isolated. In the future, I am willing to fully answer questions from everyone and the outside world at various regular or irregular gatherings in order to gain insight.

[United Press, Nanjing, 19th] Premier Song issued a statement today explaining China's economic policy, responding to attacks from the media, and predicting that if the current negotiations can achieve lasting peace, then this policy "will be able to rebuild economic stability in a short period of time." Song attributed China's economic and other ills to the result of the eight-year war followed by the civil war, which disrupted transportation and prevented the smooth flow of food and goods. He described the recent article in the American "Time" magazine that accused China of living under an "incestuous economic system" as an "exposure of obscene thoughts." Song answered the accusations in "Time Weekly" one by one, denying that the government was engaged in commercial activities that squeezed out private enterprises.

### Content of Government's Memorandum to the Executive Headquarters for Military Mediation

Hoping the Communist Troops Fulfill the Agreement, Otherwise They Should Be Responsible for the Destruction. Transporting Troops to Qingdao and Jinan is Defensive in Nature for Self-Defense

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] The main points of the government's memorandum to the Peiping Executive Headquarters for Military Mediation are as follows: "After the January 10th ceasefire agreement this year, in order to earnestly fulfill the agreement and carry out the original intention of peaceful nation-building, the government stopped advancing and mobilizing troops, and at the same time, in accordance with the troop reorganization and unified reorganization agreement, greatly reduced the number of troops. Unexpectedly, the Communist troops took advantage of this opportunity to violate the agreement from the beginning, mobilized troops on a large scale, and attacked or besieged the National Army everywhere. They successively captured Jining in Suiyuan, Jianping in Rehe, Houma in Shanxi, Yutian and Dongming in Hebei, Mingshui and Longshan in Shandong, Xiayi in Henan, attacked northern Jiangsu several times, constantly destroyed transportation, and besieged more than 17 towns and cities guarded by the National Army. They have always refused to lift the siege in accordance with the mediation agreement, and actively blockaded materials, cut off the livelihood of the military and civilians, and prohibited people from traveling in and out. In order to seek peace sincerely, the government has repeatedly tolerated and has always been in a passive self-defense state. In all areas within the scope of the agreement, no troops have been transferred to reinforce. Until the 6th of this month, after the government reiterated the ceasefire order, the Communist troops still took advantage of this ceasefire opportunity and suddenly launched a full-scale offensive in North China, Central China, and the Northeast from the 7th of this month, with Shandong being the worst. The important strongholds they captured in Shandong were Zhangdian, Zhoucun, Dezhou, Tai'an, Zaozhuang, Gaomi, Jiaoxian, Nanquan, Lancun, Zhilanzhuang, and many other cities and towns. At the same time, they destroyed the Hanzhuang Canal Railway Bridge (this bridge was repaired after the ceasefire) at the junction of Jiangsu and Shandong. In this situation, the government has repeatedly tolerated, hoping to give the Communist Party another opportunity to seek peace, and has never taken active measures. However, the Communist troops did not think this was enough, and instead gathered 50,000 troops on the outskirts of Qingdao and more than 100,000 troops on the outskirts of Jinan, and continued to increase them, fiercely besieging the near suburbs of the two cities. In particular, the situation in Nanquan and Huangbu, the water source of Qingdao, was extremely dangerous, and the island and the Cangshan Airport were also threatened. As for the coal and grain areas of Jinan, the blockade was even more severe, and they have recently approached the suburbs of Jinan City, such as Dangjiazhuang and Geshang, causing the situation in these places to be extremely critical, and the livelihood of the military and civilians is becoming increasingly precarious. The government has repeatedly reminded the Communist troops to pay attention and demanded that they stop the attack, but they have ignored it. Now, for the absolute need of self-defense, it has been forced to transport the 54th Army to Qingdao and the 73rd Army to Jinan. However, this move by the government is still defensive in nature for self-defense. It is still hoped that the Communist troops can quickly realize their mistakes, immediately stop the attack, abide by the ceasefire agreement, and resolve the issue by peaceful means. They should immediately withdraw from the cities occupied after the ceasefire and return them to the government to show their sincerity in fulfilling the agreement and seeking peace, otherwise, the Communist troops should be responsible for destroying peace and all the misfortunes that occur as a result.

[US News Agency, Peiping, 19th] The government and Communist Party members and American representatives of the Executive Headquarters for Military Mediation issued the following statement today: "Recent reports in newspapers have stated that the government representative of the Executive Headquarters has announced the abolition of the 15-day ceasefire agreement. This is a rumor and is absolutely inaccurate. The heads of the conflict control teams of the Executive Headquarters, the Nationalists, the Communists, and the United States held a meeting and commented on the telegram from General Du Weiming. The above rumor may have arisen from this, but none of the three committee members attended this meeting. The newspaper has exaggerated the above comments and misinterpreted them. In order to avoid hindering the current mediation work, the three committee members sincerely hope to correct all parties' persuasion through this joint statement."

### New Military Service Agency to be Established, Organization and Personnel Under Discussion, Lin Wei Convenes Military Service Design Conference

Vice Ministers Wang Jun, Liu Fei, Liu Shiyi, and Fan Hanjie, as well as the heads of personnel departments of relevant units, attended the conference, which was presided over by Vice Minister Wang Jun. Several important cases were resolved at the conference.

### Severe Famine in Guangxi, People Eat Tree Bark and Grass Roots to Fill Their Stomachs

[United Press Agency Guangdong Dispatch, 18th] According to the Liuzhou news published in the Guangzhou Daily, there are starving people everywhere in Guangxi Province. They are willing to give their own children to people with the means to raise them, to avoid letting them starve to death. Only the rich can afford to eat two meals of porridge a day. Starving people can only gnaw on tree bark and grass roots. The price of rice in Guangxi has recently risen to about 70,000 yuan per dan. There are two perfectly corresponding reasons for the famine in Guangxi: first, a prolonged drought, and then too much rain. In Liuzhou and Wuzhou, starving people can be seen lying on the roadside. Other passers-by are all dejected and do not pay attention to the starving people dying by the roadside, as it has become commonplace. The famine in western Guangdong is also very serious, and there have been tragic incidents of cannibalism in some villages.

### Ambassador Wei Will Go to Beijing Today; States That the U.S. Aims to Help Our Revival; Overseas Chinese Hope That Domestic Problems Will Be Resolved Soon

[Central News Agency This City News] Wei Daoming, our ambassador to the United States, is scheduled to go to Beijing today to report on his work. Yesterday, Wei met with reporters and spoke freely about Sino-U.S. relations. He said that China has undergone eight years of war, and the duration of the war is longer than that of any other country, so the losses suffered are also the greatest, and the difficulties are even greater. This is something that all countries should recognize. Wei believes that the U.S. policy towards China has been consistent and unchanged. Although there is criticism of us, it is all well-intentioned, and its purpose is to help China revive as soon as possible. American personnel have expressed their support for the mediation work of Special Envoy Marshall and believe that Marshall's mission must be completed. Secondly, the work of the U.S. military in China to help us repatriate Japanese residents and prisoners of war, and to help us transport troops, is actually carrying out missions in accordance with the original plan. This is one of the U.S. policies in China after Japan surrendered, and its purpose is to help strengthen our transportation work. Wei reiterated that the US$500 million loan will be realized in the near future. The reason for the delay is that there are still minor details that have not been resolved. As for what the minor details are, Wei did not answer. The negotiation of the Sino-U.S. Commercial Treaty has been progressing smoothly in Chongqing and Nanjing, and the issues are very broad. Ambassador Wei also expressed his views after returning to China this time. He emphasized that China's economic problems today are very serious, and the degree of difficulty is more than that of other countries. The main problem is the dual difficulty of material distribution and sources. This is a difficult situation formed by the eight-year long-term war of resistance, but he firmly believes that the solution to domestic economic problems is very optimistic. Wei said that the current stage is the most difficult stage. Adjusting prices and circulating materials will require considerable effort and time, but with the end of the war, military demobilization has been gradually completed. Previously, military demobilization affected transportation, but now this phenomenon has gradually decreased, and the number of transportation ships has increased, transportation tools have improved, industrial recovery has been completed, and economic difficulties have been fundamentally resolved, so the future is bright. As for the point that too many foreign materials have severely hit domestic industries, Wei said that the government should urgently seek remedial measures. When reporters inquired about the general situation of overseas Chinese in the United States, the ambassador said that there are about 50,000 overseas Chinese in the United States, all of whom hope that domestic problems will be resolved soon. Finally, when reporters inquired whether he would become the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Wei said that he could not answer this question before going to Beijing.

[Huadong News Agency] Since Wei Daoming, our ambassador to the United States, arrived in Shanghai on the evening of the 17th, many people have visited him, mostly from the judicial community, including Zhu Nianci, the presiding judge of the Shanghai District Court, Xie Zhiying, a judge, and Zhou Zhenhua, a judge of the Taipei District Court. Wei said that Zhu Nianci and others were all classmates of law and political science, and that the alma mater had purchased 300 mu of land in Yangchan, so it was necessary to actively work to build a new school building. In the future, he hoped to add a journalism department to help promote the rule of law and cultivate talents, and encouraged Zhu and others to maintain the glory of law and political science in history and to inform the general students to unite and serve the country, society, and the people.

Commentary

### The Economic Problems of China

— Wang Dequan

The whole country is currently troubled by the issue of prices! Prices are rising frequently, the people's lives are becoming more difficult, and they are in a state of constant anxiety. The industrial sector, on the other hand, is complaining that the exchange rate is too low, that domestic products cannot compete with the cheap and high-quality foreign goods, and that they fear their own imminent collapse. Speculators are taking advantage of this psychology, spreading rumors, adding fuel to the fire, and stirring up a surge in gold and foreign exchange. Those who do not understand this hear it and are either happy or worried. In fact, the price problem and the exchange rate problem are two sides of the same coin. The value of money is expressed internally by prices and externally by exchange rates. According to common sense, the purchasing power of money domestically must be balanced with its purchasing power abroad. At a time when the domestic purchasing power of money is not yet stable, to speculate on changes in the exchange rate is like sitting in a well and looking at the sky.

Take today as an example. If the exchange rate is raised, it will only stimulate domestic price increases and further reduce the purchasing power of legal tender. Conversely, if the government implements the current foreign exchange policy of keeping the exchange rate fixed in order to lower domestic prices and bring the domestic purchasing power of legal tender closer to its external purchasing power, this may be effective for a time, but it is ultimately not a good policy. Although the central bank has a huge amount of foreign exchange reserves, using these funds to fill a bottomless pit will be difficult. Once the foreign exchange reserves are exhausted, the exchange rate will inevitably skyrocket, domestic prices will again be out of control, and the previous efforts will be completely wasted. Moreover, domestic enterprises will collapse even before the foreign exchange reserves are used up because they cannot compete with the dumping of foreign goods. Therefore, the current solution to China's economic problems should be to address both the price problem and the exchange rate problem simultaneously in order to achieve success.

To stabilize domestic prices, the first step is to increase the supply of production goods. There are two ways to increase the supply of production goods: restore domestic industries and encourage the import of foreign goods to compensate for the insufficient domestic production. This is the active approach. On the passive side, we should encourage the public to start a frugal and conservation movement to reduce consumer goods. At the same time, the government should stop issuing additional currency to slow down the velocity of currency circulation and promote lower prices.

The key to China's current production problems mainly lies in the following points:

(1) Traffic is blocked and transportation is inconvenient. The procurement of raw materials and the sale of production goods often make it difficult for enterprises to profit due to high prices. Once they encounter foreign competition, they are even less likely to be able to compete. Therefore, unimpeded transportation is urgently needed today, and the government authorities have an unshirkable responsibility. Whoever wants to disrupt traffic and obstruct transportation today is an enemy of China's production industry.

(2) Wages are too high, reducing corporate profits. Chinese workers' wages were traditionally known to be low in the world. Therefore, when unequal treaties existed, foreigners set up factories in our country, taking advantage of our country's low labor costs, and our country's production industry, although technologically backward, could still barely survive because of low wages. Today, the wages of some Chinese workers are actually higher than those of American workers, coupled with various other difficult problems in production, how can they compete with foreign goods? Therefore, wages should be reduced appropriately. However, the reduction of wages should be conditional on suppressing prices first. When prices fall, wages will naturally fall accordingly, and workers' lives will not feel difficult. Conversely, when prices are high, wages are also high. Wages and prices follow each other in a causal cycle, which will inevitably stifle all enterprises. Looking at the labor unrest and price surges of the previous month, they often went hand in hand, and the reason is obvious.

(3) Interest rates are too high. When raising funds, the business community is suffering from the burden of high interest rates, which is also an important reason for the increase in production costs. The government should provide long-term, low-interest loans to important domestic production industries according to their needs to reduce their production costs. When necessary, the government should also provide production subsidies to certain domestic industries to enhance their competitiveness in the international market.

The benefits of international trade, in addition to adjusting the surplus of international production, are to promote the international division of labor. For goods that a country cannot produce or is uneconomical to produce, it should take advantage of foreign industries that are in a relatively economic position. The people of the country can obtain the same enjoyment at a lower price, and at the same time, they can devote their full efforts to engage in other industries that are particularly suitable for domestic production, and engage in mass production with a favorable environment and low costs. In addition to supplying domestic needs, they should also try to sell abroad as much as possible. Before the war, although countries implemented tariff barrier policies due to political relations, international trade has always been prosperous and not tired, because there are undeniable benefits in it. However, encouraging imports is not blind, and must be carefully planned in advance, and it is selective.

Next, let's talk about stabilizing exchange rates. The thorough way to stabilize exchange rates is to seek a balance of international payments, in other words, the inflow and outflow of foreign exchange must be balanced. If a country has a long-term trade deficit, it will inevitably lead to the expenditure of huge amounts of gold, which will lead to the poverty of the country and the decline of the people. If we want to achieve a balance of international payments, we must have a certain policy on the entire international trade, not only have a comprehensive plan for international payments, but also bring the function of international trade to its peak. As for how to use international trade policy, just look at how to use tariff policy.

China should make full use of tariff policy for the import of foreign goods into the country, which is self-evident. For goods that the country cannot produce or is uneconomical to produce, the government should only levy low import duties for the purpose of financial revenue. For products whose domestic production is insufficient, the government should limit their import volume, and levy heavy taxes on amounts exceeding the limit. For foreign goods that are in competition with domestic products, very high tariffs should be levied, or even their import should be prohibited, in order to protect domestic industries. The import of luxury goods and the like should be absolutely prohibited in order to save the country's foreign exchange. Now that unequal treaties have been abolished, tariffs are already autonomous and unrestrained. Extreme tariff barrier policies can certainly lead to foreign countries taking the same retaliatory measures, but if our country implements this kind of tariff policy to protect its immature industries, there are many precedents in the history of world trade, and it will not cause misunderstandings among countries.

Our country's agricultural, mineral, and handicraft products that are sold all over the world include tea, silk, tung oil, eggs, pork bristles, sausage casings, tin, textiles, and embroidery, which are very popular in various countries. Now, it is simply too expensive to export them. The government cannot ignore this phenomenon, and it should be given assistance now. In addition to exempting export taxes, export subsidies should also be given to promote their vigorous export sales. Manufactured industrial products are sold in the South Pacific Islands, and we cannot sit idly by and watch the loss of this good market today. We should eliminate the various bottlenecks of production problems, encourage production, and encourage exports, which can be used to develop domestic industries and obtain foreign exchange from this to pay for the foreign exchange needed to import goods. At the same time, the government should strengthen the control of foreign exchange. Foreign currencies are absolutely not allowed to be used domestically, and importers and exporters must collect and settle foreign exchange to and from the central bank or its designated banks. Before the war, overseas Chinese remitted huge sums of money back to the motherland every year, which was also an important way for our country to obtain foreign exchange, so the government must provide sufficient convenience for the remittance of funds from overseas Chinese in order to encourage them.

In addition to determining the degree of assistance for certain products for export as needed, the nature of exports should be strictly determined by the Commodity Inspection Bureau. Only qualified products are allowed to be exported to avoid foreign countries from generating bad impressions. The investigation and statistics of the foreign market situation must also be reported regularly by our country's consulates abroad so that producers have a full understanding of the supply and demand situation in foreign markets. The government authorities should not only plan these various facilities to assist international trade today, but also strive to implement them.

Some people say that since the government must stop the policy of currency inflation, where does the huge amount of money come from? Since customs duties were not fully autonomous under the shackles of unequal treaties and the tax rate was low, now that unequal treaties have been abolished and customs duties are already autonomous, under the implementation of the tariff policy system, low tariffs are levied on imports that the country cannot produce or is uneconomical to produce. At the same time, extremely high tariffs are levied on imported goods that are in competition with domestic products. On the one hand, prohibition is implied in the levy, and on the other hand, the revenue is used to pay for subsidies. This amount must be considerable.

China's production industry has been gradually collapsing in the past few months due to its inability to compete with the continuous flow of cheap foreign goods. If we do not rise up and rescue it urgently, the tragic consequences will befall us! China has a population of 450 million, accounting for one-fifth of the world's total population, and is known for its vast land and abundant resources. China is the best market in the world, and the Chinese people are good customers for the world's commodities. Once the Chinese economy collapses, the impact will be enough to affect the entire world economy. China's prosperity is closely related to the world's prosperity. As long as our government officials are sincere and honest, plan for the country, and urgently seek remedies to revive China's economy, not only will domestic elites be able to stand up and help, but allied authorities will also be able to understand and give assistance, and will never hinder our legitimate measures.

### Disagreements Arise Again Among the Four Foreign Ministers; Shadows Loom Over the Paris Conference Again; The Italian Reparations Issue Remains Deadlocked; Easier Issues Discussed Yesterday

[Our Dispatch] London, 19th (Radio): Two hours ago (11:00 p.m. Shanghai time), the four major powers' foreign ministers continued their meeting in Paris, discussing several smaller issues related to Italy and the French-Italian border issue. The meeting is in progress, and the results are unknown.

[United Press Paris, 19th] The four foreign ministers discussing the Italian peace treaty are still deadlocked on the issue of Italian reparations. The agenda item approved for today is several small economic issues and the French-Italian border issue, which are relatively easy to resolve. The four foreign ministers are scheduled to meet at 2:00 p.m. today (11:00 p.m. Shanghai time), one hour earlier than usual, to allow French Foreign Minister Bidault to attend the Constitutional Assembly. At yesterday's meeting, the four foreign ministers could not reach an agreement on the issue of Italian reparations, causing the pessimistic atmosphere among all parties to deepen.

[United Press Paris, 18th] The four foreign ministers discussed the issue of Italian reparations today for two and a half hours, but still did not reach a result. Bevin suggested that the major powers should give up their claims for Italian reparations and help its democratic government. Molotov still expressed his dissent. Byrnes suggested that the entire issue be transferred to the European Peace Conference for discussion.

[Associated Press Paris, 19th] Yesterday evening, when the four major powers' foreign ministers held a meeting, the British proposal on the Italian issue was opposed by the Soviet Union, thus forming a new deadlock. Britain suggested that the four major powers give up all claims for Italian reparations. Molotov insisted that the Soviet Union must obtain US$200 million in reparations from the former Axis countries and submitted a resolution to the Paris Conference. As for the reparations, most of them should be taken from the current Italian production sector. Byrnes adopted a strong stance on the Soviet Union's attitude, replying that the meaning of this move was nothing more than to give the millions of dollars in American aid to Italy to the Soviet Union. Molotov then made a slight concession, saying that he was willing to accept Italy's luxury cruise ships "Saturnia" and "Vulcania" as part of the US$100 million reparations claim.

[Reuters Paris, 18th] The Foreign Ministers' Conference did not reach an agreement on the Italian reparations issue today, but the opinions are more flexible than before. Byrnes and Bevin still advocated that the US$100 million demanded by the Soviet Union could be paid by Italy's property in hostile territories and domestically, as well as Italian merchant ships and warships. Molotov insisted that it was not enough to pay the US$100 million, and the shortfall still needed to be made up by Italy's existing production within six years. Bidault believed that Italy could do it if this period could start within two years. Bevin opposed both the Soviet and French proposals, believing that this claim was tantamount to invalidating the clause on granting the United Nations "most-favored-nation" treatment agreed upon yesterday.

[Central News Agency London, 18th] Bevin has drafted a new plan to break the deadlock on the Italian southern border issue and will submit it to the Foreign Ministers' Conference within the next two days. The plan suggests that Trieste and its surrounding areas be designated as a neutral territory under the direct control of the United Nations.

### Western Democratic Countries Can No Longer Make Concessions to the Soviet Union; The New York Times Publishes a Harsh Criticism of the Soviet Union; and Expresses Frank Pessimism About the Foreign Ministers' Conference

[Central News Agency New York, 17th] The New York Times editorial accused the Soviet Union with an unprecedented two-line headline. It stated that if the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference cannot make rapid and definite progress in drafting peace treaties in accordance with the hopes of Europe, which is "hungry and war-torn," then the Western democratic countries can no longer surrender to the Soviet Union and allow it to infinitely obstruct peace and hinder their own leadership. The New York Times also gave the most straightforward criticism of Soviet foreign policy. It said that since the Tehran Conference, in international power politics, the Soviet Union has demanded the greatest concessions from its Western allies, but has not reciprocated with concessions to the opinions of its allies. It has then proceeded to include what it has gained, and has only issued unilateral actions, even without the approval of its allies or in accordance with peaceful solutions. The Soviet Union's policy of unilaterally expanding its power is undoubtedly a violation of the Atlantic Charter. The newspaper finally expressed frank pessimism about the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference and endorsed Byrnes' suggestion that if the Paris Conference fails again, the peace treaty issue should be submitted to the 21-nation peace conference or the United Nations for discussion, because work related to the whole world must continue and cannot wait alone for a certain power. After the above was published, Moscow newspapers and radio broadcasts criticized American policy. It should be noted that the New York Times editorial represents an important part of American public opinion and is highly regarded because it can reflect the opinions of the American authorities to a certain extent.

### The "Left" and "Right" of American Foreign Policy (Part Two)

— Special Correspondent in the United States, Mao Shuqing

Foster's article begins by saying that the Soviet Union values economic equality and extremely disregards individual freedom. Therefore, American diplomats cannot use the American perspective of individual freedom and development to observe or criticize the Soviet Union. However, he says that the Soviet Union now prioritizes security, fearing the combined power of Britain and the United States to destroy its homeland. Foster divides the Soviet Union into three zones: the Russian homeland as the core, then extending outward to the middle defense zone, and then to the outer zone. According to Foster, the Soviet Union's various actions in Europe and Asia, such as "aggression," are all aimed at strengthening its middle defense zone.

Lacking Understanding of the Soviet Union

I have no idea how much influence this article can have. Anyway, in American society today, being able to say a little something about the "Soviet Union" is considered the most intelligent thing. The words and actions of several "Russian experts" at Columbia University are now attracting attention in American society. Some say that Americans do not understand China. Indeed, Americans still have many misunderstandings about China. However, Americans' lack of understanding of the Soviet Union is probably a hundred times deeper than their lack of understanding of China. Starting this autumn, Columbia University will establish a special "Soviet Russian Academy," to which government officials from the State Department, various ministries, and the General Staff will be sent for study. It will not accept ordinary students, and foreign students are even less welcome.

In the hundreds of bookstores in New York, it is more difficult to buy books about the Soviet Union than in London. However, most of the books and pamphlets about the Soviet Union on the London market are propaganda, either pro-communist or anti-communist. Comprehensive works of a more specialized nature, like those written by the Webbs in the past, are also rarely seen. In April and May of this year, one of the books with the highest sales in New York was called "I Chose Freedom," which is a rather interesting and good book depicting the Soviet Union.

That book was only published at the beginning of this year. The author, Kravenko, was originally a Ukrainian from Russia. His father was a communist revolutionary, so Kravenko was instilled with communist ideology from a young age. From the Lenin era to the Stalin era, he had always been a loyal member of the Communist Party and worked in a metallurgical factory. Because of his intelligence and hard work, he rose from worker to foreman, and from foreman to metallurgical engineer. After Hitler invaded the Soviet Union, he joined the Red Army and served as the captain of an engineer corps. Soon, he was sent to the United States by the Russian government to serve as a member of the Purchasing Committee in the United States. Suddenly, on April 4, 1944, Kravenko disappeared in Washington, D.C., and broke away from the Communist Party. At that time, American newspapers published his mysterious disappearance like a detective novel. It was not until recently that he publicly published this "confession" of hundreds of thousands of words.

Two Perspectives on China

In an environment where economic equality and individual freedom cannot coexist, Kravenko's experience tells readers that he chooses the latter. Therefore, his book is called "I Chose Freedom." It is an extremely honest report. He describes many strengths of the Soviet Union, but also exposes all the dark secrets of the Soviet Communist Party's dictatorship. He said that he had always tolerated and kept silent about these unacceptable things, and only gained liberation after arriving in the United States. The author confidently states that the Soviet Union was able to achieve final victory in this war not because of the Soviet system, but because of the miracle of the Russian nation's patriotism.

The same theory as Kravenko's now seems to be gradually becoming widespread in the United States. After the Paris Four Foreign Ministers Conference ended, Republican Senator Vandenberg, in a broadcast speech after returning to the United States, repeatedly emphasized the theoretical opposition and the practical contradiction between communism and democracy. One left-leaning newspaper scolded Vandenberg for lacking common sense. That newspaper said that the opposite of communism is capitalism, and the opposite of democracy is dictatorship, saying that Vandenberg was being naive and nonsensical. I don't know who is being naive? And who is being nonsensical?

The New York "Afternoon Post" attacked the American delegation to the Paris Conference most fiercely. Several of the "Afternoon Post's" star editorial writers, such as Guggs and Lyner, published several articles one after another, saying that Byrnes was taking gambler-like risks in diplomacy. They said that Byrnes was essentially incapable of breaking the deadlock in relations with the Soviet Union, except by risking leading the United States into a third war. On the other hand, a "declaration" led by famous reporter Powell and Admiral Yarnell斥斥斥 Byrnes for being incapable of solving the Far East problem and obstructing China's unified nation-building.

In fact, the diplomacy towards China cannot be blamed on the State Department. In fact, none of General Marshall's reports went through the State Department; they were all directly given to President Truman. There is a rumor circulating in the Washington State Department that before General Marshall went to China, he consulted with former Ambassador Hurley. General Hurley's heartfelt words were just this one sentence: "Don't let these things be known to those guys in the State Department." General Hurley looked down on those "old farts," the American professional diplomats. General Hurley said that they have two perspectives on China: either the traditional imperialist perspective, or the revitalized communist perspective.

I have no way to investigate the internal situation of the State Department. In fact, it is also inappropriate for a foreign journalist to try his best to investigate the inside story of the diplomatic administrative organization of the country in which he is stationed. However, in any case, the work of the US State Department today is more burdensome than at any time in the past. Therefore, there are also more external accusations and criticisms than at any time in the past.

However, none of these are enough to create a "gulf" between the President and the Secretary of State. Mr. Truman would not transfer away a Secretary of State whose political views are the same as his own, and accommodate another person to implement his foreign policy. Because, in the minds of Americans today, or in the American political circles, the Democratic government inherited by Truman fairly represents the "right wing." His shift to the right in policy has not gone too far in diplomacy. However, in domestic affairs, since this strike wave, it has already caused a great commotion. (The End)

### U.S. Secretary of the Navy Speech: The True Meaning of Freedom

[United States Information Service, Williamstown, Massachusetts, 18th] Secretary of the Navy Forrestal delivered a speech at William College here on the 16th, discussing the American way of life, stating that the essence of American life, whether in one place, one state, or the whole country, is that the government serves the individual, and is not the master of the individual. He also said: Today, we cannot isolate ourselves from the world. The flames of war that arise in the Middle East, India, or the Balkans will inevitably have a profound impact on our lives. A hundred years ago, we could close our doors and not ask about foreign affairs, but today, with the development of science and the acceleration of transportation, as the Secretary of State recently said: "Unless we understand that peace is indivisible, we will be forced to participate in a global war." Today, there are two major forces in the world challenging human thought: one is the force of democracy, and the other is the issue of centralized government power. The story of democracy can only be believed by people who have sufficient physical and mental faith to govern themselves willingly. People can only care about abstract things such as free government and individual freedom after they are well-fed and clothed. Hunger, a state without dare government, and economic chaos are fertile ground for the growth of dictatorships. We know that the United States has no intention of conquering territory or other selfish intentions. We must declare our motives to the world as a light of hope in the darkness. We hope that the light of freedom, tolerance, and peace will once again shine on the whole world.

### U.S. Congressman Proposes: Should Not "Appease" the Soviet Union; Truman and Stalin Should Discuss Openly as Soon as Possible

[United Press, Washington, 18th] Four members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee returned home after a two-month inspection in Europe. Today, they submitted a report advocating that the United States immediately abandon "any policy that smacks of appeasement" towards the Soviet Union. However, it is advocated that President Truman should openly exchange views with Marshal Stalin face to face as soon as possible. The United States and the Soviet Union should adopt a completely reciprocal policy. The rights enjoyed by Russians in the United States must not exceed those enjoyed by Americans in Russia. The four committee members are Republican congressmen Mende and Barton, and Democratic congressmen Gordon and Reed.

### Claim of Soviet Troop Concentration in Southeastern Germany

### Soviet Representative Uses Veto Again in the Security Council: Compromise Proposal on the Spanish Question Overturned

[United Press, New York, 18th] The United Nations Security Council today discussed the issue of referring the Spanish question to the United Nations General Assembly. The Soviet Union strongly opposed the majority and used its veto power. This is the first time that the United Nations organization has used its veto power since it started working in the United States. In the Security Council, the compromise proposal put forward by the subcommittee, which advocated that the General Assembly propose severing relations with the Franco government in September this year, or taking other appropriate actions, was approved by nine votes to one. The Netherlands abstained during the voting. The Chairman, Mexican representative Najera, announced that the proposal had been vetoed. Polish representative Lange then requested that his proposal made in April, which called for the United Nations to immediately and completely sever relations with Franco, be put to a vote, but the Chairman said that the Council did not intend to discuss the Polish proposal and announced an adjournment until Monday afternoon of next week. Earlier, Soviet representative Gromyko declared that the Council had broad powers to order the severance of relations with Spain, and it was its duty to not shirk it to the United Nations General Assembly. U.S. Representative Johnson expressed his support for the compromise proposal put forward by Evatt, saying that the Council's adoption of this action was most appropriate, and that this seat also played a strong role in the drafting of this proposal.

[Reuters, New York, 18th] The United Nations Security Council met today, and the United States opposed the British amendment to submit the Spanish question to the September General Assembly meeting, but did not make any suggestions.

Economic and Social Council Passes Soviet Proposal

[United Press, New York, 18th] The Soviet Union advocated that the economic and social plans of the United Nations organization should be drafted by government representatives, and should not be chaired by non-governmental experts. The Economic and Social Council passed the proposal yesterday by a vote of eleven to five. Britain and the United States opposed the Soviet proposal, while China supported it. India and Norway abstained.

International Organization for Relief Work Group

[United Press, New York, 18th] The United Nations Economic and Social Council today advocated that international relief work should be extended to German and Austrian Jews, as well as other foreigners and stateless people living outside the two countries. The Council rejected the proposal by the British representative by a vote of six to four, which would not include foreigners and stateless people residing in Germany and Austria within the scope of relief. At the same time, it passed a compromise proposal put forward by France by a vote of six to five, proposing that the international relief organization to be organized will have a certain interpretation of those it regards as "refugees." It is said that the so-called "refugees" refer to "Jews, or foreigners or stateless people residing in Germany and Austria, who have been detained in the two countries due to hostile acts or environmental conditions, or who have fled from the two countries and eventually returned to the country, and who have not yet definitively settled in the two countries."

### British Labour Government Fails in the House of Lords

Coal Mine Nationalization Law Amended

[Reuters, London, 18th] The Conservative opposition party in the House of Lords recently obtained a pass by a vote of 54 to 28, requesting an amendment to the Coal Mine Nationalization Law. The original proposal approved by the House of Commons allowed the nationalized coal mine bureau to arbitrarily determine the selling price of coal. Conservative members of the House of Lords were deeply afraid that the bureau would sell it to nationalized enterprises at a low price, and sell it to private enterprises at a higher price, so they proposed an amendment stipulating that the determination of prices should not be different.

### Bidault Expected to Be Elected President

[United Press, Paris, 18th] It seems certain today that Foreign Minister Bidault, leader of the Popular Republican Movement, will be elected president, but there is no immediate hope for clarifying the chaotic political situation. The Popular Republican Movement believes that Bidault can get 350 to 400 votes in tomorrow's Constituent Assembly vote, but actually getting 198 votes is enough.

### Italian Supreme Court Formally Rules: Republic Wins Over Monarchy in Referendum, and Announces the Number of Seats for Each Party in the Constituent Assembly

[United Press, Rome, 18th] The Italian Supreme Court today ruled in simple terms that the Republic won over the Monarchy in the June 2 referendum. This ruling is like lighting a match after setting off fireworks, and it is no longer exciting. The ruling stated: The results of the 118 electoral districts not included in the first count, as well as the slight changes in the number of votes due to accusations of electoral fraud, did not greatly change the difference in the number of votes won by the Republic announced on June 10. The final total number of votes is as follows: The Republic won 12,717,923 votes, and the Monarchy won 10,719,284 votes. In comparison, the Republic won 1,998,639 more votes.

### Japan's Military Training for Young People Is Indeed Aggressive: Testimony of Professor Ouchi of Tokyo Imperial University; Six U.S. Defense Attorneys Resignations Approved

[United Press, Tokyo, 19th] The International Court continued to try Japanese war criminals today. Witness Ouchi, a professor of economics at Tokyo Imperial University, appeared in court. According to the new procedure, Ouchi prepared a statement in advance, which was read out in court by the prosecutor. It stated that Japanese military training instilled the spirit of military force and the glory of war in young people across the country, and even induced young people to believe that this was necessary for Japan's future happiness. In 1890, Emperor Meiji issued an edict, which began to spread the idea of military force and extreme nationalism in Japanese schools. One of the dogmas stated that "dying for the Great Emperor is the greatest glory." As a result, during the Pacific War, thousands and thousands of Japanese soldiers were drunk and crazy, and did not hesitate to bleed to practice this belief. The authorities asked teachers from all schools to fully cooperate in establishing aggressive ideas, otherwise they would be dismissed or imprisoned. Former Minister of the Interior, Kido, forced a university professor who wrote articles advocating peace to resign. In 1938, when Araki served as Minister of Education, he implemented compulsory military training in universities. Seven years ago, when Araki served as Minister of the Army, he asked Tokyo Imperial University to open a military affairs training class, but it was unsuccessful. In 1937, seven university professors, many teaching assistants, and Ouchi himself were dismissed because they were suspected of sympathizing with peaceful ideas. They were also detained by the police. After Japan surrendered, the university invited them to resume teaching. However, he said that Araki had nothing to do with his dismissal.

### Wang Daren Transferred to Court for Detention: Three Tai and Other Rice Shops Connected to Grain Loan Case, Along with Stored Rice, Sealed Off

Police Department Yesterday Summoned Five More Grain Merchants: Jurisdiction Issue Divided into Two Parts

[Report from this Newspaper] It is learned that the Garrison Command Investigation Department, together with the Municipal Government Investigation Office and police officers, were dispatched yesterday to seal off several rice shops related to the grain loan case and the rice stored in various warehouses. Those sealed off include: (1) San Tai Rice Shop at 353 Jiangxi Road, Room 105, and 6,722 bags of rice stored in the Bank of China warehouse. It is reported that 3,350 bags are stored in the name of Xie Daheng Rice Shop. (2) Changjiang Company at 97 Zhongzheng East Road and 150 bags of rice stored in the Bank of China warehouse and 40 bags of rice stored in the China Trust Company warehouse. (3) Housheng Company at 97 Zhongzheng East Road and 1,103 bags of rice stored in the China Industrial Bank warehouse, 296 bags of rice in Dinghe Warehouse, and 567 bags of rice stored in the Dakang Bank warehouse. It is reported that the Housheng Company's office is located within the Changjiang Company and is actually a branch company of Changjiang Company.

Furthermore, the Military Law Office of the Garrison Command continued to summon five grain merchants yesterday afternoon: Wan of Wanchang Rice Shop, Xing Songwen of Jiangbei Company, Yang Runyu of Wanchang Xin Rice Shop, Xu Taiyuan of Zhifeng Rice Shop, and Wang Yuzhen of Huifeng Company. At this point, all rice merchants related to the grain loan case have been questioned. A comprehensive overall review of the case will begin today.

Wang Daren Detained in Temporary Detention Center: Listed as Inmate Number 1382

[Report from this Newspaper] Prosecutor Wu of the District Prosecutor's Office, considering that Wang Daren (Shanghai native, 41 years old), the main suspect in the case, had not yet been summoned for interrogation, specifically sent a letter to the Garrison Command to transfer him. After Xuan Tiewu approved it, Wang was escorted to the District Prosecutor's Office on Xuehuali Road at around 4:00 PM yesterday. Prosecutor Wu Qihua and Clerk Wang immediately conducted an interrogation. He was then ordered by the judicial police to be detained in the temporary detention center of the Shanghai District Court near the District Prosecutor's Office, listed as inmate number 1382.

Xu Kan May Appear as a Witness

Reporters from the East China News Agency went to various related parties yesterday to inquire about the details of the grain loan case, as follows: (1) The investigation of this case was personally ordered by Chairman Chiang, and it was conducted jointly by the Military Intelligence Bureau, the Central Bureau of Statistics, and the Shanghai-Songhu Garrison Command, with Garrison Commander Xuan Tiewu responsible for presiding over the investigation. In accordance with Chairman Chiang's instructions, the investigation was completed within ten days, and it was completed as of yesterday. (2) The Grain Administration once declared that it would sell 11,000 dan, entrusting San Tai Rice Shop and others to sell it, but the result was delayed for more than ten days, causing rice prices to soar. (3) The grain loan rice was traded back and forth among the grain loan merchants without being sold on the market. (4) During the investigation, Wang Daren attributed everything to being done under the orders of Minister Xu, and it is feared that the Garrison Command will ask Xu Kan to testify.

Jurisdictional Issues

[Another Report] The trial procedure for the grain loan case has encountered divergences because the District Prosecutor's Office and the Military Law Office are conducting trials simultaneously. There is great attention to whether the case should be tried by military law or handled by the judiciary. The reporter specifically visited Prosecutor Wu Qihua of the District Prosecutor's Office, who is handling the case, yesterday. According to the interview: The handling of the grain loan case can be divided into two parts, that is, Chairman's order: all cases of hoarding grain and speculating to raise prices will be tried by military law, and the part of corruption by public officials, because they are not military personnel, should be resolved by the judicial organs. This is based on the impeachment by the Jiangsu District Cheng Supervisory Envoy, and they are currently contacting the relevant agencies to clarify the judicial procedure. Regarding the defendant Yang Xizhi, who is detained in the United States and has not returned, the office has sent a letter to the Ministry of Food, and a subpoena has been sent with the letter, requesting it to be delivered on his behalf, so that he arrives in court on time. Wang Daren, the defendant detained by the Military Law Office of the Garrison Command, has also been requested by letter from the office to be transferred to the office for investigation. In the end, it was said: The date of the retrial of this case is set for 9:00 AM on the 24th of this month. Subpoenas have been issued to ten grain loan merchants, including Xie Changtai Zhu Shilu, Xinchang Zhu Yongming, Tongcheng Chuan Changyu, Xie Daheng Feng Yongsheng, Qianchang Yu Yuliangji, Hengtai Zhang Chao, Tongyi Company Lu Linxun, San Tai Company, Huifeng Company, and Changjiang Company, to appear in court for interrogation on that day. After that, several more rigorous investigations are required, and after the investigation is completed, a public prosecution will be filed in accordance with the law.

Also, Li Chongnian, director of the Field Grain Office, the protagonist of the grain loan case, who was released on bail by the District Prosecutor's Office and the Military Law Office of the Garrison Command, went to Beijing yesterday morning, but if there is a summons from the District Prosecutor's Office and the Military Law Office, it is said that Li will arrive in court with the summons.

Zhang Daomin Speaks:

[Report from this Newspaper] The reporter recently visited Zhang Daomin, a counselor of the Ministry of Food, to inquire about the details of his coming to Shanghai to preside over the Shanghai Grain Storage and Transportation Office. According to the interview: He came to Shanghai this time under the order of Xu Kan, Minister of Food, in the capacity of counselor, to help preside over the affairs of the municipal Grain Storage and Transportation Office. On the one hand, he also came to take care of his family members in Shanghai. He said: The Grain Administration is still in the process of closing down, and it is expected to be completed by the end of the month. However, since the organizational regulations and staffing of the Storage and Transportation Office have not yet been issued, the details are not yet known. However, it is hoped that it will be established on July 1st. Before the office is formally established, he does not know the details and cannot make any statements. It is understood that after the establishment of the Storage and Transportation Office, it will specialize in the storage, transportation, and allocation of military grain. Therefore, the business is simpler than that of the Grain Administration. The number of staff will also be reduced compared to the Grain Administration.

Grain Management Under the Social Affairs Bureau

[Report from this Newspaper] Mayor Wu, having heard that grain prices in the city are soaring and the grain problem is serious, the Municipal Government decided to transfer grain management to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau. It was originally intended to set up a separate office, but due to limited funding, it has now been decided to be under the First Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, forming a Grain Section. Its organization will be larger than other sections, and it is currently requesting instructions from the Municipal Government. After Mayor Wu approves it, it can be established. The main tasks in the future will be to crack down on manipulation and suppress rice prices.

According to Deputy Director Li Jianhua of the Social Affairs Bureau, in the future, when rice merchants purchase rice, they must first register with the Grain Section and buy rice with a purchase order. They must also register the quantity purchased and the stored rice in detail with the Grain Section and sell it at the price stipulated by the authorities. It is expected that after the implementation of these rules, rice prices will tend to stabilize.

### Fake Policeman Huang Wenzhong: Traitor Sentenced to Two and a Half Years; Frenchman George Pochard Acquitted

[Report from this Newspaper] Huang Wenzhong, a clerk in the puppet Huangpu Branch Bureau, was sentenced by the Special Criminal Court of the High Court yesterday afternoon. The main text: "Huang Wenzhong, colluding with the enemy, plotting to resist this country, sentenced to imprisonment for two and a half years, deprivation of public rights for two years, and all property confiscated except for the necessary living expenses for family members." Furthermore, George Pochard, a Frenchman, was previously suspected of being a traitor. He was sentenced yesterday, but due to insufficient evidence, he was acquitted, and the court ordered him to be released on bail.

### Shao Shuhua Tried Yesterday

Shao Shuhua, deputy manager and deputy director of the Business Bureau of the Shanghai Branch of the "Central Reserve Bank," was prosecuted by the prosecutor for disturbing financial order by colluding with the enemy. He was retried by the collegiate panel yesterday. The defendant replied: He had previously served as the county magistrate of Shanghai County, and later abandoned politics to devote himself to industry, founding the Changyu Coal Mine Company. During the Anti-Japanese War, he endured four years in Shanghai, and later, due to livelihood reasons, he took up a puppet position in the thirtieth year of the Republic. However, although he served as deputy director of the Business Bureau, he did not go to Nanjing. As deputy manager, he only stamped the receipts.

Witnesses Li Jiaqing, Liu Shaojun, and Wang Wangshi, the mother of Wang Beiying, arrived. According to Huang Jidu, he claimed to be the nephew of Mayor Qian and the Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Social Affairs, but this was just acting on the spur of the moment, just "bragging." As for defrauding Wang Beiying of 800,000 legal currency, he flatly denied it. When asked about Zhao Atu and Jiang Yiping, they also denied it, but said that they had falsely claimed to be Huang's bodyguards. Huang Baobao, looked like a country woman. According to Huang Bodu, they were married, , Huang Bodu's behavior has always been unrestrained. He said he made a living by doing odd jobs.

### Case Outside the Case: Impersonating a Guard to Run Messages: Chen Xi's Tricks Backfire

[Report from this Newspaper] On March 27th of this year, Xu Peihuang, the son of Xu Shihui, was sentenced to four months in prison and two years probation by the District Court for causing the death of an elderly man named Shen in a bicycle accident. The Xu family was dissatisfied, claiming that two soldiers at the scene witnessed the person hitting the car, not the car hitting the person, and posted advertisements to invite the two soldiers to be witnesses for the appeal. Chen Xi saw this and, not knowing that Xu Peihuang was out on bail, thought he was detained in prison, so he forged Peihuang's letter, saying that he needed 40,000 for medicine in prison, and then asked for 20,000 for the carrier's fee, and impersonated guard number 107 of the District Court Detention Center, to "run the message" to Xu's home on the afternoon of the 23rd of last month. He was exposed by Xu's father and arrested by the police and sent to the court for processing. The case has been publicly prosecuted by prosecutor Quan Tao, so Chen Xi not only did not "run" to get the "message," but instead ran into prison.

### Researching National Medicine's Special Drugs: Chen Guofu Enthusiastically Advocates

Reporting Changshan's Anti-Malarial Effects Surpass Quinine

[Our Newspaper's Report] Central Committee member Chen Guofu, in view of the scarcity of Western medicine sources during the Anti-Japanese War and the urgent need for self-sufficiency in national medicine, strongly advocated refining and manufacturing drugs from national medicines that truly possess special efficacy. After several years of meticulous research by domestic medical experts, significant results have been achieved, including the special anti-malarial drug Changshan. Mr. Chen initiated the organization of the "Chinese Special Drug Research Institute" last year, concurrently serving as its director. During his recent visit to Shanghai, he invited over thirty medical experts and prominent individuals from the city, including Jiang Yiping, Yu Songyun, Yu Yunxiu, Wang Qizhang, Li Shengbo, Xu Xiaochu, Wang Genzhong, and Bao Guochang, to discuss related matters. Mr. Chen reported on the institute's founding principles and the process of researching and manufacturing the special anti-malarial drug Changshan, stating briefly: In the spring of the 31st year of the Republic (1942), feeling that the rear areas were blockaded by the enemy, the source of Western medicines was cut off, and malaria was prevalent in the southwest, creating an urgent need for treatment drugs, it happened that Cheng Jingfang, an employee of the Third Division of the Attendant Office, distributed copies of a published malaria treatment prescription to colleagues. Some malaria patients recovered after taking one dose. He then requested the Central Political School Medical Research Institute to conduct chemical verification, and it was discovered that Changshan was the main ingredient. After clinical trials on over a thousand people, and with three allocations of research funding from Chairman Chiang, three years of successful experiments completely proved Changshan's effectiveness as a malaria treatment drug, surpassing quinine in its efficacy. After the news spread, this Changshan drug, which had been used for over a thousand years, attracted the attention of the domestic and international medical communities. Countries such as England and the United States came to request it. Therefore, colleagues initiated the organization of the research institute to expand operations. In addition to malaria, research will also be conducted on the most prevalent and difficult-to-treat diseases in our country, such as typhoid fever, tuberculosis, rabies, leprosy, cancer, and mental illness. Furthermore, research will be conducted on the cheapest and most effective drugs to replace expensive Western medicines. Subsequently, Deputy Director Cheng Xueming reported on the institute's organization. Wang Genzhong, Yu Yunxiu, Wang Qizhang, and others spoke in succession, unanimously supporting Mr. Chen's advocacy and hoping that enthusiastic individuals in the city would provide as much financial assistance as possible to facilitate rapid development.

### China Silk Company Facilitates Exports Through Consignment System to New York

Activating Silk Merchant Funds for Selling at a Favorable Price

In order to facilitate raw silk export trade and promote the business operations of silk cocoon manufacturers, the China Silk Company has contacted raw silk importers and manufacturers abroad. For export raw silk that has passed inspection by the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, a consignment method is adopted for shipment to New York. The company will use its name to obtain a mortgage from the National Bank, advancing 70% of the loan based on New York market prices. Manufacturers only need to bear an annual interest rate of 3%, with a term of three months. Once the silk is sold in New York, the loan will be settled. This method not only activates the circulation of manufacturers' funds but also allows raw silk to be sold at a favorable price. In May, the company facilitated the export of 900 bundles of alkaline silk in the first batch, all of which were 78, 81, and 83 "degree" silk. Recently, another 400 bundles of raw silk were loaded onto a ship bound for New York on August 20th.

Recently, there have been contacts with British and French parties, and in the future, the target export countries will be the United States, Britain, and France. If foreign merchants have existing connections with their domestic silk factories and can offer reasonable prices for transactions with the company, the company is also happy to cooperate, ensuring that the quantity of raw silk exported is absolutely free.

### Shanghai's Top-House Craze: Companies Outside the Market, Western Doctors Eager to Switch to Business: Not Seeing Patients, But Houses

In order to understand the nature of the "company" organizations that trade in top-houses (houses with transferable leases) in the city, the reporter made a roadside visit. According to investigations, these types of "companies" are mostly concentrated on Avenue Joffre (霞飛路), Rue Cardinal Mercier (環龍路) and Chongqing Road. The ×Da Company at number ×××, Rue Cardinal Mercier is one of the best, its facilities being more complete than those of other companies.

The ×Da "company" is established in an old French-style municipal building along the road, more like a shop than a company. The entire organization does not comply with the company law. It's business is centered only on the taking of brokerage from those trading in these leases.

According to manager Mr. Shen, this "company" has been established for several months. Based on average transactions of past months, about twenty top-houses are traded each month. Its profit is therefore quite considerable.

Most of the houses it owns (that is, those available for transfer) are registered with it through the direct or indirect introduction of friends, with the information entered into a register, such as the location, number of rooms, telephone, sanitation facilities, gas, lease prices etc. If the information is indirect, when the top-house is traded, the middleman on average receives a commission from the "company."

When a customer (top-house buyer) comes to inquire about a house, the manager refers to the register, explaining the details and asking the customer to fill out a letter of commission: the letter states that the "company" will find a house on his or her behalf, and upon completion of the deal, the "company" will take 1/10 as a brokerage, which cannot be delayed, and will pay a commission fee of 2,000 legal currency, this is a regular monthly income item. Imagine if about twenty people go to commission it daily, the company will make 40,000 legal currency in commission fees, that is, this one item of commission fees, each month it will be over millions of legal currency. The "company" has no fixed capital, only one phone, one desk, and several chairs. The "company" does not hire staff, but is made up of several partners who also act as managers, brokers, etc. It is claimed that this "company" was originally a Western doctor's clinic, but the business was so dull that it could not maintain itself, so it switched to this business. Fortunately, the organization is simple, and when business is poor, it can be closed down at any time.

Since the reporter made an inquiry as a customer, he was allowed to look at its registration book at random. The top fees range from five to thirty "bars", which shows the ruthlessness of those who own houses and the heavy exploitation of the lease-trading brokers. (Zhaoyue)

### Extremely Worthy of Attention: Fish That Slipped Through the Net: The Deportation of Japanese Overseas Chinese and Prisoners of War: Inadequate Investigation: Many Key War Criminals Not Arrested

[Our Newspaper's Report] The deportation of Japanese overseas Chinese from the city is nearing completion. According to Mr. Liu Shifang, the president of the military tribunal of the First Pacification Area Command, who previously told reporters, the number of Japanese war criminals who have been transferred is not very large, and many lack supporting evidence. Therefore, most Japanese people will safely return to their country and spend their remaining years in peace. However, according to a senior official of a certain Chinese military agency who is extremely familiar with the situation in Japan, who told reporters: the preliminary investigation for this deportation of Japanese overseas Chinese and prisoners of war was not thorough, and many of the main perpetrators of the invasion of China are likely to become fish that slipped through the net. For example, Iwai Eiichi and Fukuma, senior officials of the Japanese Embassy who were previously responsible for cultural work in the Jiangnan area, have not been arrested. In addition, in the Nanjing-Shanghai area, everyone knows about the "Tobe Unit", which specializes in collecting materials and issuing passports for the enemy. The person in charge of this "Tobe Unit" is Kaneko, the head of the "Kaneko Agency" who was responsible for special operations in Suzhou. It is now heard that he is also at large. In addition, there is also the well-known member of the Black Dragon Society, Colonel Iwata, Yamaie (山家), who was responsible for intelligence in North China, and Er Wang, who was responsible for special operations in Shanghai in the later stages of the Anti-Japanese War, and there has been no news of their arrest. As for the puppet police bureau, the French traitor Shariku has been executed, but Goshima Shigeru, who was in charge of "Special Higher Police" at the time, has not been punished. If he is not subjected to legal sanctions, it is truly disappointing.

### National Universities to Conditionally Allow the Establishment of Preparatory Classes Starting in 1946: Avoiding the Retaking of High School Courses in the Lower Years of University

[Special Telegram from Our Newspaper in Nanjing] University preparatory classes were originally one of the wartime facilities. In 1938, after Wuhan fell to the enemy, many secondary school graduates fled to Sichuan. In that year, the Ministry of Education piloted a unified enrollment system. Those who were not admitted had nowhere to go. To help these young people, a special university preparatory class was established in Baisha to accommodate them. Later, there were young people of this type in various places, so each university was allowed to establish preparatory classes. After one year of study, the top 50% in terms of grades were allowed to be promoted without examination, which was very convenient for high school graduates. Later, two independent preparatory classes were added in Xiuning, Anhui, and Ganxian, Jiangxi, to accommodate out-of-school youths in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Hunan, Jiangxi areas. Now that the Anti-Japanese War has been won, the Ministry of Education expects that there will still be people who want to go to university whose education are not at the level of acceptance, and at the same time, in order to improve the level of universities and avoid the need to retake high school courses in the lower years of university, it has been decided that starting this year, national universities and independent colleges will be allowed to establish preparatory classes. The independent preparatory classes that were originally specially established will all be closed at the end of this summer vacation. In accordance with the method of establishing preparatory classes affiliated to national universities and independent colleges, preparatory class students will be self-funded in principle, and the subjects studied will be limited to remedial high school courses. After one year of study, after strict examinations, those who pass all subjects will be allowed to enter the first grade of the relevant colleges and universities without examination to study.

### National Universities and Independent Colleges Affiliated Preparatory Class Methods Total Eleven

The "National University and Independent College Affiliated Preparatory Class Method" recently announced by the Ministry of Education is recorded below: (1) In order to improve the level of universities and avoid the need to retake high school courses in the lower grades of universities, the Ministry of Education has decided to allow national universities and independent colleges to establish preparatory classes starting from 1946. Those who originally had preparatory classes should be closed at the end of the 1945 academic year.

### Zhang Guogong, a Student at Lida School, Wounded the Director of Discipline and Was Sentenced to Fifteen Years of Imprisonment

[Our Newspaper, Chengdu] The case of Zhang Guogong (also known as Zhu Yuquan), a student at Chengdu Lida Middle School, who wounded the Director of Discipline, Zhu Peisheng, was sentenced by the Criminal Court of the District Court on the 29th of last month, with President Xu personally serving as the judge. When the criminal was brought to the court, he was disheveled and looked utterly distraught. After the judge inquired about his name, age, place of origin, and residence, he immediately read out the verdict. The gist was that Zhang Guogong, a student at Lida School, used a knife to attempt to kill someone, which was confirmed by the school and students present at the scene. He was found guilty of "attempted murder" and sentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment and ten years of deprivation of civil rights. The compensation portion will be handled by the Immigration Court. As soon as the verdict was announced, the criminal Zhang glared and said loudly to the judge, "You are right, you might as well sentence me to death. I will definitely not appeal..." The judge then told him that if he believed the verdict was inappropriate, he could appeal to the High Court within ten days after the verdict, and there was no need to argue here. He immediately announced the adjournment. Zhang Guogong was then returned to prison. (Quan)

### Elementary School Curriculum Research (10): Strengthening the Nation with Science: Natural Science Teaching Time Should be Increased, Strengthening the Race Requires Hygiene: Hygiene Teaching Subject Should be Restored

In the age of science, in the world of science, after the end of World War II, atomic bombs, radar, rockets... people and farmers are still constantly researching and inventing, preparing for the Third World War. China, which was sick but fortunately rose to become one of the four great powers, how should we promote science and develop science with the belief that nation-building will surely succeed, given our historically backward scientific development? In the elementary school curriculum, which is related to the foundation of national construction, the content of natural science should of course be enriched! The teaching time for natural science should also be increased!

The hygiene subject, in the present era of promoting health education, was once independent. The revisers of the standards were afraid that there were too many subjects, so they separated the hygiene teaching materials and incorporated them into social studies and group training, deliberately dividing systematic and complete knowledge into fragmented pieces, as if this was in line with psychology, and it was a crime to adopt scientific compilation and conduct systematic research. In fact, if it is believed that children's mental abilities are limited, and the elementary school curriculum should not be too heavy, then hygiene knowledge is not necessary; hygiene habits should not be cultivated; then it is not necessary to separate many hygiene materials and incorporate them into other subjects, which would only increase the burden on other subjects. If it is said that the "Sick Man of East Asia" has not yet recovered, and national health must continue to receive special attention. For the sake of reasonable research and strengthening learning effectiveness, there is a great need to restore the elementary school hygiene subject! (Qian Dasan, 35, 6, 13, in Zhenjiang)

### Speculative Groups Remain Unrepentant: Black Market for Government Bonds Rises Again; Before the Universal Currency System is Corrected, How Can Redemption Leave the Legal Tender?

Yesterday, the panic over government bonds subsided. Surface gangs became active again, and buying interest gradually increased. The Unified C Bonds opened flat in the morning, but after the opening, there was another wave of excitement, which boosted buying interest. Midway, the price rebounded to around 150 yuan, but before closing, it fell back to below 2950 yuan. As a result, it closed 300 yuan higher than the previous close. A and B Bonds also rose 300 yuan, D Bonds rose 200 yuan, and E Bonds rose 400 yuan.

Furthermore, according to Yu Huancheng, Chairman of the Securities Dealers Association, the occurrence of this incident was purely due to speculation. He had repeatedly warned all colleagues to be cautious in their transactions to avoid future troubles. However, Shanghai is a mixed place, and during the enemy-puppet period, speculative habits were formed. After the victory, this trend was difficult to overcome for a while. The price of the Unified C Bonds, for some unknown reason, was raised to such a high level. Recently, the news of redemption and interest payment came, and the market price plummeted, leading to the tragic fate of more than a dozen securities firms going bankrupt. This was truly a case of reaping what one sows. According to financial authorities, the recent sharp drop in bond prices is a normal phenomenon. Because the face value of the bonds is based on legal tender, and today the universal currency system is still legal tender, the standard has not changed. In the future, the government's redemption and interest payment for these bonds will still be calculated in legal tender. For example, the Unified C Bonds once rose to a peak of 8,200 yuan for every 100 yuan face value, compared to a pre-war market price of only about 60 yuan. The reason for such a strong rising trend now is due to the flow of speculative funds to this area.

### Gold Market Calm

Yesterday's gold market was even more stable. It opened flat in the morning, and after the opening, it fell from 1.895 million to 1.88 million. Excessive floating had been cleared up, and after that, it gradually became peaceful, hovering around the opening price. The central government allocated 225 bars at a price of 1.895 million. After 10 o'clock, it briefly rose slightly to over 1.9 million. At noon, it struggled at 1.895 million. In the afternoon, it rebounded slightly. As a result, it closed 10,000 higher than the previous close. US dollars and Hong Kong dollars were both popular, leading to this situation. Gold ornaments and silver ingots were both flat. Secret lending rates were flat. Those with funds still dared not release them easily. Many people bought gold notes, and interest rates ranged from 12% to 15%.

### US Dollars and Hong Kong Notes are Both Popular

Foreign exchange US dollars opened at around 2,600 yuan in the morning. Although it fell slightly to 2,590 yuan after the opening, foreign firms soon bought in, and it gradually recovered to around 2,630 yuan. In the afternoon, it struggled around 2,620 yuan. As a result, it closed 20 yuan higher than the previous close. Hong Kong notes rose 20 yuan due to news that the US Senate Banking Committee had urged the House of Representatives to pass the British and American loans in advance, and that bill brokers were buying in. The Hong Kong exchange rate was over 480 yuan, the Indian exchange rate was 590 yuan, and the US exchange rate was stagnant.

### Guangzhou Opens Foreign Exchange; Measures are the Same as in Shanghai

[United Press Guangzhou, 18th] The Bank of China announced today that nine banks in Guangzhou have formed an association to jointly manage foreign exchange, with measures similar to those in Shanghai. The participating banks include the Bank of China, Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank, Farmers Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Central Trust Bureau, Postal Remittances and Savings Bureau, Guangdong Bank, Banque de l'Indochine, and China National Products Bank. However, there is no large-scale foreign trade here yet, because the business of British and American firms, except for oil and steamship companies, is currently very quiet. It is said that foreign trade in South China has not developed normally due to restrictions from the Chinese Company Law and Customs Regulations.

### Tea Market Lacks Activity; Gongxi Factory Produces Tea for Domestic Sales

The depressed tea market for foreign merchants has seen industry colleagues try hard to develop, but ultimately failed due to high costs, resulting in continued dullness. Recently, the Wuchang and Xinhua tea companies in this city, as well as the British firm Jardine Matheson, are planning to ship more than 3,000 boxes of black and green tea for export. As for domestic sales of fancy teas, although the shops and dealers in this street and the Suzhou area are demanding them, the holders are solely focused on hoarding and raising prices. With an uneven supply and demand, the market lacks activity. Gongxi green tea, which specializes in sales to Mumbai, India, has seen its appeal revive because the street recognized that low-quality goods were not welcomed there, but the market prices were very suitable, leading to a gradual resumption of demand. Currently, deals have been made, and there are plans to modify production for domestic sales.

### Liquidation of Banks and Firms; Formal Conclusion to be Ordered

It is said that some are still waiting and hoping to resume business, while others are still secretly engaging in discounting and lending activities. The authorities have already taken note of this and are said to be issuing strict orders to expedite the closure and formally announce it, reporting to the Ministry for record.

### Yarn Market Calm; Spot Cotton Transactions Become Smoother

Yesterday, the yarn market was increasingly stable. Large-scale 20-count yarn from the South China group was frequently absorbed, and the price continued to rise by 120,000 yuan. Shuangma yarn took the lead and once broke through the 1.4 million mark. Medium and small-sized 20-count yarn and double-strand yarn prices were not affected. 32-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn rose slightly by 10,000. Sentiment was calm because the street's door sales and weaving factories both lacked demand. At noon, the spinning and weaving factory opened for yarn sales as usual. Sunlight offered 20-count yarn at a price that was 10,000 lower than the previous period. The prices of other counts of yarn also fell by 10,000 to 40,000. Today, the silver and money industry will hold its semi-annual closing holiday, and the yarn industry will also close for one day.

Yesterday, New York American cotton telegraphic news fell 16 to 24 points. Near-term American gold was 29.200, long-term 29.30, and Mittling spot was 29.99. The local spot cotton market was stable, but transactions became smoother. Xin Yuren, Desu, Lun, and Qingfeng factories all made purchases. Flower numbers were also traded, and the market was not deserted.

### Taiwan Company Unwilling to Supply; Sugar Prices Decline and Then Rebound

Rumored that 60,000 bags will arrive in Shanghai at the end of the month

Yesterday, the sugar market was initially very flat because the Taiwan Sugar Company intended to continue selling. However, when company employees went to the association to observe, the market atmosphere was very strong, and they backed off. The market began to question the company's mission to suppress prices and examined the facts. The company had only sold middle-grade sugar four times in total. When sales opened, each firm applied for a purchase quota based on the amount they could consume, which determined the market trend. The company would delay until 3 or 4 pm to decide on the quota and price. The fourth application reached 70,000 bags, but only 9,500 bags were supplied. The price was "determined by them," and buyers initially had no objections. However, the company still felt it was insufficient. The day before yesterday, they changed to a method of selling high. Yesterday, the market went even further, and they would not supply even at high prices. This created a situation where sugar prices declined and then rebounded. The association's marked price for middle-grade sugar in the morning was initially 91,500 yuan and 2,000 yuan. When news of the company stopping sales came, it quickly rose to 98,500 yuan. The opening price in the afternoon was the original price, but it soon reached 99,000 yuan, and it closed at 98,000 yuan, up 6,000 to 7,000 yuan from the previous day. Numbered goods followed closely. Kai Quanzhou Yang was 40 bags, 91,000 yuan, Xinghua white 103,000 yuan to 98,000 yuan, more than 200 baskets, Xing Chi 94,500 yuan, Diao Qing hundreds of bags, 74,000 yuan to 6,000 yuan, Huanggang Qing 80 bags, 77,000 yuan.

According to Song Yixin, manager of the Taiwan Sugar Company, the company has shipped 5,500 tons of sugar, about 60,000 bags, from Taiwan. Two ships, one from China Merchants and one from Moller, are expected to arrive in Shanghai before the end of the month. A branch company is also being prepared in North China because shipping Taiwan sugar from Keelung, unloading it in Shanghai, and then transporting it to North China would require two freight and storage fees, which would invisibly increase the price of sugar. It has now been confirmed that the cost of shipping Taiwan sugar directly to North China is the same as shipping it to Shanghai. Therefore, the company has decided to establish a North China distribution office in the shortest possible time. With an ample supply of sugar in other ports, the price of sugar in Shanghai will also be automatically suppressed.

### Rainproof Cloth Sells Well; Inland Searches are Quite Intense

Rainproof cloth sales have recently exceeded any previous period because in the past it was only used by the public to make raincoats, but this summer it is needed for American-style clothing by various sectors of the air and land forces. In particular, Nanjing gangs are widely selling it. They have successively shipped seven or eight thousand yards. It is said that Xuzhou, Anqing, Xi'an, and other ports also need it, and they are searching for it in Beijing, which has further increased its sales. Scarcity makes it expensive. With large actual sales and activity, the market supply cannot meet the demand, and prices are rising steadily. Each yard has risen from 4,000 yuan to 7,250 yuan. Most are still lacking spot goods. It is necessary to place an order with raincoat cloth manufacturers ten days in advance and pay 70% deposit in advance. Generally, rainproof cloth manufacturers are earning three times their profit and are rushing to dye and sell inferior cloth. The colors fade, and there are many jump wires and blocks, but operators only seek to profit, adhering to the principle of producing more and faster, regardless of quality, cutting corners, and reducing materials. Recently, sales have been slightly affected, and prices have fallen to about 6,000 yuan per yard.

### Economic Briefs

The Central Bank authorities, noting that deposits in various silver and money firms in the city are decreasing month by month, intend to readjust deposit interest rates and have instructed the Financial Institutions Inspection Office to be responsible for researching standard interest rates, which will be implemented in the second half of the year.

The city's rice market has decided to divide into two areas, north and south, and will begin implementing this next month. The Jiangnan Electric Power Bureau, established by the Resources Committee, is now striving to carry out a large-scale power generation plan. It is reported that if the plan is completed, not only will the entire electricity supply of Shanghai be sufficient, but also the electricity supply of all cities and counties in the Jiangnan region will be abundant.

Hong Kong, 18th: Star Island has a severe shortage of cloth. In the past month, more than 1,000 pieces have been shipped from the city to meet the market demand, including printed cloth, black cloth, and poplin, with printed cloth being the most common. Therefore, the price of printed cloth in the city has risen.

### Chinese Stocks Continue Cross-Trading; Market Conditions Gradually Stabilize

Some large Chinese stock traders continue cross-trading. Retail investors' psychology is slightly stable. Industry insiders are also adding maintenance. Stocks that had fallen too much rebounded more strongly yesterday. At its peak, Yongsha had a high price of 615 yuan, Mei Ya 4080 yuan, Jingfu 265 yuan, Xinguang 255 yuan, and Qinxing 200 yuan. The afternoon closed slightly lower. As a result, Yongsha and Mei Ya fell slightly, while the three small stocks rose by more than half a percent. Medium and small unpopular stocks were stable. Old stocks remained weak. The foreign stock situation was stable. Except for Jardine Matheson, the remaining stocks had a few buyers and showed some activity. Ewo Silk once rose to around 10,600 yuan and then turned flat. As a result, Jardine Matheson fell slightly. Ewo Brewery, Paper, and Yeguang were flat. Ewo Silk, British Alliance Steel, and Asia continued to advance slightly.

Furthermore, according to people who have studied finance, some factory stocks are now increasing their par value due to increased capital, but many factories have machines and production equipment that have exceeded their applicable years and are old and unusable. Industrial production will soon become a major problem. Therefore, it is necessary to pay attention to whether the increase in value is appropriate.

### American Fruit

Another 20,000+ boxes arrive in Shanghai; more large quantities coming tomorrow

[Our Report] American fruit is arriving steadily. Yesterday, the American President Lines' World Liner Scottish Islander arrived in port in the evening, carrying a large amount of fruit, over 20,000 boxes, and over 10,000 boxes of chemical raw materials. The Norwegian ship Sumireer, which will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow from the United States, is also carrying a large amount of fruit. The ship is managed by Shun Heng & Co.

Furthermore, Jiuda Refined Salt has also arrived in Shanghai. The China Merchants Bureau's Zhixin ship brought 5,000 bags from Tianjin the day before yesterday.

### Osaka Branch of the Bank of China Transferred to the Bank of Japan for Liquidation

[Remodeling Agency Tokyo, 19th] The Osaka branch of the Bank of China, which was previously placed under the management of the "Closed Institutions Custodian Committee" by the Ministry of Finance, has now been instructed by the MacArthur Headquarters on the 13th. The ministry announced a provincial ordinance today, transferring the bank to the Bank of Japan for liquidation from today onwards.

### French Cocoon Production Increases by 60%

[Reuters Paris, 19th] Although the mulberry trees in the Bessèges area have been damaged by unfavorable weather conditions, this year's cocoon production can still increase by 60% compared to last year.

### Market Trading is Thin; Rice Prices Remain Stable

Since the implementation of the rice number front store rice distribution method, people's minds have been settled. Market trading among colleagues is thin. Yesterday, the prices of various grades of goods remained unchanged. The market trend showed no change. Only 2,597 piculs of passenger goods were registered, a decrease of 1,411 piculs from the previous market. Flour prices are weak, continuing to fall by 500 to 600 yuan. Wheat bran fell slightly by 400 to 500 yuan again. Broad beans arriving in large quantities are being digested normally, falling slightly by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, with few transactions. Soybeans are stable, but raw peanuts are outstanding. Shantou prices were firm early and weak in the afternoon. New wheat is coming onto the market, and the source is gradually increasing, but the trend remains flat. Soybean cake digestion is weak, rural sales are sluggish, and prices are falling by 500 to 600 yuan.

### Rayon Supply and Demand Imbalanced; Factory Prices Stable, Silk Goods Weak

Yesterday, 120-count bright rayon from Tianqiao opened at 1.6 million yuan in the morning. With imbalanced supply and demand, it was again rising and popular. The highest price was 65 yuan, and it then fell back to 620,000 yuan at the close. The afternoon price was 640,000 yuan, up 70,000 yuan from the previous day. The price once reached 680,000 yuan in the afternoon, but there were no buyers, and it became a pipe dream. Miscellaneous brands were all 30,000 to 40,000 yuan higher. 75-count Jingji semi-gloss had a declining sales style, but was still expensive due to scarcity. The price was similar to 120-count bright rayon from Tianqiao. Yesterday, holders sought to sell, so the asking price failed to keep up. Amid a consistent rise, it brought a high of 10,000 yuan. Factory prices were stable. The market was quiet. Few transactions took place. Selling prices generally did not change much. The scenery of silk goods has faded. Mei Ya quilts had no transactions all day yesterday. Taicheng checks and crepe were 5,250 yuan in the morning and 320 yuan in the afternoon. Sheng Hang goods were also slightly weak.

### Cotton Cloth Passenger Sales Sluggish

The cloth market was plain and unremarkable. Due to sluggish passenger sales, everyone is taking a wait-and-see attitude. The market transaction is very leisurely, so the prices have fallen by 250 yuan to 500 yuan. However, the stock is not thick, so the market is still stable. The China Textile Company has not yet resolved the matter of exchanging American and Mexican cloth.

### White Coal Market Prices Decline

The white coal market situation is still depressed. All goods are still shrouded in decline, and market prices continue to trend downstream. Hongji Jiaozuo lump coal and small lump coal, although the stock is thinner and has special uses, the owners are still trying to hold it up, but ultimately they cannot take care of the overall situation and have also seen a small cut. Bituminous coal trends slightly, and the foundation is also weak. Although the market for coal balls and firewood is stable, sales of all goods are sluggish.

### Famine in Guangxi, Dancing in Liuzhou

— Special Correspondent Liang Xiaozhong, Airmail from Liuzhou, Reporting for This Newspaper on the 3rd

According to reports from Guangzhou newspapers regarding Liuzhou, the entire province of Guangxi is filled with famine victims. They are willing to give their own children to those who have the means to raise them, to prevent them from starving to death. Families with teenage daughters are searching for potential husbands for them. Only the wealthy can afford two meals of porridge a day, while famine victims can only gnaw on tree bark and grass roots. The price of rice in Guangxi has recently risen to 70,000 yuan per *dan* (a unit of dry measure, approximately 100 liters). Guangxi is originally a rice-producing area, so this price is considered extremely high. The cause of the famine in Guangxi is due to two directly opposite reasons: first, a prolonged drought without rain, and then, too much rain. In Liuzhou and Wuzhou, famine victims can be seen lying on the roadside. Other passersby are dispirited, and no one pays attention to the dying famine victims, because such scenes have become commonplace.

The above situation appeared in a Guangzhou dispatch from the United Press on the 18th. Now, we have received an airmail report from our special correspondent, reporting the latest details of Liuzhou, which serves as confirmation and is especially moving. (Editor)

In the vast night, the car, accompanied by a gust of wind and drizzle, once again brings me into this heart of Guangxi.

Beneath the peaks of Mount Liyu (Carp Fish Peak), gauze-like mist and clouds swirl. Pale yellow lights illuminate the broken roads, the mud and water on the roads, and the densely packed thatched huts along the roadside. Everything seems so bleak and gloomy. The ruthless artillery fire has shattered this heart into pieces.

New Buildings and Broken Tiles – Forming a Stark Contrast

Turning past Mount Liyu and entering the city center, it feels like stepping into another world. Stately, newly constructed buildings stand proudly erect in the rubble. Transportation companies, real estate companies, banks... Looking across, and even further, brand-new buildings interspersed with dilapidated walls form a stark contrast. "The recovery is coming soon," I think to myself. Liuzhou was one way two years ago, another way a year ago, and now Liuzhou is rapidly changing towards a new life. The vicissitudes of life, the ever-changing world, thinking about it truly fills one with countless emotions.

A screen of verdant stone mountains surrounds Liuzhou tightly, like a large cake. A rushing, turbulent Liu River crosses this heart, flowing to the endless distance, dividing the city into north and south sides. Today, the bustling and lively scene in Henan (south of the river) is ten times more prosperous than it used to be, while Hebei (north of the river) remains desolate, desolate, and pitiful. In the past, Peixin Road, a financial street no more than 500 meters long with seventeen banks, now, except for a dozen or so newly built businesses and hotels, is desolate and deserted. At night, the lights are dim and pedestrians are few. When the music from the hotels occasionally drifts through the rubble, one truly doesn't know whether it is sour or sweet.

Slogans High Above Restaurants – Dancing and Disaster Relief

The essence of the entire city is concentrated in a corner of Henan. Here, I can say that if it weren't for the four industries of hotels, restaurants, gold shops, and transportation companies, Liuzhou would simply not be a city and could hardly be said to have recovered its prosperity. In other words: hotels, restaurants, gold shops, and transportation companies have revived Liuzhou's "prosperity." On my first night walking on the streets of Henan, I counted the relatively decent hotels, and before I even reached half, I had already counted to forty-two. Exhaustion made it impossible for me to continue counting. Otherwise, this would have been a rather interesting statistic. Moreover, all the restaurants are competing with each other in ingenuity, each striving to be different, with strange and wonderful "preferential" methods that are too numerous to describe. On the top floor of the hotels, there is the sound of "booming and thumping." Guangxi is starving, but Liuzhou is dancing? What is laughable is that at the entrance of every restaurant's staircase, there is a disaster relief donation box, forlornly shrinking in the corner, and the people going in and out don't even glance at it. Slogans like "A single meal costs thousands of gold, where does the money come from?" are plastered on the walls of the staircase. The people who don't know where the money comes from are still desperately dispersing banknotes. Slogans are too commonplace for them.

Hotels Like Bamboo Shoots After Spring Rain – Scattered Throughout the Streets and Alleys

Hotels are like tender bamboo shoots after a spring rain, scattered throughout the streets and alleys, but finding a room is not easy. On the night of the reporter's arrival, despite the rain, I ran through eight hotels in a row before finally finding a room that a traveler had just moved out of. The overnight fee was 2,500 yuan. This price would naturally not be surprising in Shanghai, where gold bars are used for transactions, but in Guangxi, it is truly rare and expensive. As I write this, I look out the window, and the streets below are bustling with countless travelers rushing for fame and fortune, hurrying back and forth. One after another, they leave a hotel and run into another!

What is strange is that the signboards of every business here are written by one or two people. At first, I thought that the calligraphers were probably some kind of masters, but later I saw that the writing was not very skillful. After some time, I realized that they were either written by commissioners or county magistrates. Even a small tire repair shop had a sign that read "Inscribed by Xiao Jinghua" (Magistrate of Liujiang County). The merchants' thirst for fame is evident here, and pitifully naive.

Liuzhou's liveliness is considered second to none in Guangxi, and prices are probably not willing to fall behind. After a rain, the price of rice has stabilized a lot, but here it is still about 40,000 yuan per *dan*. A meal costs at least 1,500 yuan per person. Calculating it, a traveler has to spend at least 6,000 yuan a day. In a second-hand stall on the street, there is a suit of unknown material. Asking the price, it is 300,000 yuan. Amitabha! My salary for three months is not enough to buy a suit! The war has changed everything, but only prices are like the river water of the Liu River, overflowing day by day, rising foot by foot. When the autumn wind rises and the spring floods are over, I don't know what it will become like.

Director Out on Inspection – Staff Chatting and Laughing Pleasantly

The Guangxi branch of the Relief Administration is located behind Mount Liyu in Liuzhou. The buildings are secluded and elegant, with painted beams and flying eaves, truly a paradise on earth. The reporter also ran to the front of the door to admire it. Director Huang had gone out on inspection, and only a few staff members in sharp suits were standing at the door chatting and laughing with their girlfriends. Not wanting to disturb them, I retreated circumspectly. Turning around, I headed towards the refugee camp.

The relief branch is located in Liuzhou, so logically speaking, the refugees in Liuzhou should naturally be the first to benefit, but in the reporter's personal opinion, this "benefit" is not very bright. However, in good conscience, it is indeed better than nothing.

The refugee camp is at the foot of Ma'anshan (Saddle Mountain), no more than 200 steps from the relief branch. Compared to the deep courtyard of the branch, it is far inferior. Four or five hundred people are crammed under some American-made tents. Occasionally, there are one or two mud houses, with a room less than two *zhang* (approximately 6.6 meters) square crammed with forty-six people, plus some broken and ragged furniture of the refugees, truly a pigsty. Some are lowering their heads mending clothes that can no longer be mended, some are catching fleas. Men, women, old and young are packed into one room. The sounds of Hunanese, Cantonese, and chattering are mixed, containing an unknown amount of tears!

Children Beg for Money – Kneeling Down with a Thud

Being able to be accommodated is considered very fortunate. How can one count the emaciated disaster victims wandering the streets every night? In a great famine, thousands upon thousands of disaster victims run to the city with a hope, but in the end, one life after another disappears in the noisy market, carrying disappointment and throwing themselves into the embrace of death. This is a portrayal of the disaster victims. On rainy and windy nights, three or five silently sleep under dilapidated walls, pressing their empty stomachs, listening to the melodious music above the restaurants. I truly don't know what their feelings are at this time? Alas!

Walking past Xiaonan Road, a child holding an iron can chased after me asking for money. I dropped a few hundred yuan into it. The child looked at the banknotes, and without a sound, "thumped" to the ground and kowtowed to me, startling me greatly. I quickly pulled him up and asked where his parents were. He pointed to the corner of the wall on the right and ran back. Although a few hundred yuan is probably no less shameful than twelve *liang* (approximately 750 grams) of relief flour, I am ashamed for myself and for many heartless people.

The "moon" that truly enjoys the moonlight near the water will not be the refugees. On the contrary, the restaurants have scooped up a large batch of American relief flour, making truly worthy "exquisite refreshments." The tycoons are wearing suits and khaki pants made from relief supplies. One day, I was drinking tea in a tea house and saw snow-white buns, which I had not seen for eight years. I couldn't help but ask the waitress, "Are these buns made with relief flour?" The waitress thought for a moment, and then gave me a sweet smile, swayed her waist, and gracefully left.

Also, recently the relief branch hired a large number of commercial vehicles to transport relief supplies to various places. Because the people in the branch are too generous in handling things, they fill the cars with relief supplies without checking them, and then let the cars drive away. As a result, the drivers of the commercial vehicles take great advantage of this. When they arrive at their destination, some of the relief supplies are missing by half, and some of the cars are even gone. Bizarre and confused, both are possible. Please tell me, should these things be laughed at or cried at?

Cultural Undertakings in Decline – No Resurgence of Vigorous Atmosphere

Cultural undertakings are out of the question here. The vigorous atmosphere of the past is now the scene of "old palace maids talking about Emperor Xuanzong." Speaking of newspapers, there are three daily newspapers: the Liuzhou edition of the Guangxi Daily, which is government-run. I don't know how to criticize it. Writing this, I suddenly remembered reading a few sentences in that newspaper, "Taking the Kuomintang's money to run a newspaper, harboring Communist Party words, what a joke, what a joke." I don't want to say that the Guangxi Daily is such a newspaper, but how should it be said? That is for the intelligent readers to think about. In addition, there are the Great Era News and the Yan News. The former is pro-Communist, and the latter is not necessarily pro-Communist. The three newspapers stand in front of the readers in an environment of struggle and losses. In addition, there is one evening newspaper and one three-day publication, both with pitifully small sales. There are very few bookstores. The Commercial Press has a branch here. Most of the other bookstores are doing a half-open business with little breath left. Shanghai-style publications are airlifted from Shanghai and sell extremely well. A publication priced at 300 yuan can sell for 600 yuan. Shanghai newspapers can sometimes be seen here a day late. Schools include the provincial Liuzhou Middle School, Liuzhuang Normal School, Liujiang County Middle School, and the private Zhongzheng and Longcheng Middle Schools. Guangxi University used to be located in Zhugejiang (Partridge River) not far from here, but it has now moved to Guilin.

Adding an Air Route from Liuzhou to Guangzhou

Speaking of transportation, this heart, since its two blood vessels—the Xiang-Gui and Qian-Gui Railways—were severed, is much more paralyzed than before. The magnificent north-south train stations of the past have now become a scene of ruins. The setting sun and withered grass are dilapidated and without light. Although the Xiang-Qian Railway has been repeatedly said to be restored by a certain date, the locomotives, sleepers, and tracks are all problems. How easy is it to talk about?

Recently, I heard that the Liuzhou to Laibin section may be open to traffic by the end of the month, but looking at it now, I'm afraid it will be another "five-day capital official," pleasing to the people. I hope the government will find a way and spend money soon. When the people of Liuzhou once again see the fire dragon spitting thick black smoke and galloping across this basin, it will also restore the spirit of the country.

The highways here reach Guilin and Changsha to the north, Yulin and Zhanjiang to the south, Yiyi and Guiyang to the right, and another road to Yongning, exiting to Vietnam, which is quite convenient. The Highway Bureau regularly has buses running between Yongliu and Guilieu, which is comfortable and cheap, but the road surface is a bit bad. You also have to constantly worry about the green forest heroes (bandits). China National Aviation Corporation has a flight to Chongqing every Thursday, and recently has added an air route from Liuzhou to Guangzhou, with a ticket price of 26,000 yuan.

The drastic changes in climate are a characteristic of Liuzhou. In the morning, when the sun comes out, you wear a single layer of clothing, but after a rain, many people quickly put on their coats. When the sun comes out, they hurry to take off their clothes again. Just putting on and taking off clothes is enough to keep people busy. (Sent from Guifeng Hotel, Liuzhou)

### Pleasant Land in Western Yunnan: Wind, Flowers, Snow, and Moon

— Airmail from Dali on the 3rd, Zhen Jun

A fellow countryman from Jiangnan (south of the Yangtze River) who has lived in Yunnan for eight years weighs 200 pounds. If you ask him when he will go back, his answer is: Shrugging his shoulders, he says, "The climate in Yunnan is too good. I can't stand Shanghai, so I don't want to go back." Indeed, Yunnan Province is the best place in China, maybe even the world, for climate. The year before last, allies came to Kunming from India over the Himalayas, and after getting off the plane, they said, "China is 100 percent better than India." Kunming's cool climate gave them a particularly good impression, and our international standing has been raised considerably.

"If you don't go to Kunming, you don't know that China has such a good place. If you don't go to Dali, you don't know that Yunnan Province has such a good place." This is the famous saying of the party and state elder, Mr. Zhang Puquan, on his recent tour of Yunnan.

"Dali" refers to an irregular rectangle from Xiaguan in the south to Shangguan in the north, backed by the Cangshan Mountains in the east and bordering Erhai Lake in the west. It is about 180 square *li* in area, with a warm climate and abundant products. This place has the red clouds, white snow, and turquoise waters of the Cangshan Mountains, the blue sky, as well as city walls, pavilions, farmhouses, fishing villages, famous flowers, exotic rocks, and ancient temple pagoda shadows. It is truly a pleasant land in western Yunnan.

Let's talk about Dali's wind, flowers, snow, and moon.

Wind

"The wind of Xiaguan." Xiaguan is the most famous town in western Yunnan. The goods of more than 40 counties and five or six administrative bureaus in western Yunnan are gathered and distributed in Xiaguan. Yunnan people say, "Xiaguan can never be filled." Xiaguan is divided into Guan Yi and Guan Wai. North of Yulong Pass belongs to Dali County, and south of the pass belongs to Fengyi County. The two counties share this town. The main street belongs to Fengyi and is very lively. The four major banks, Zhongzhong, Jiaonong, and the banks of Yunnan Province, all have branches here. Hotels and theaters are built quite well. Even the Guzu people (Tibetans) would consider this to be like Shanghai.

Where does the wind of Xiaguan come from? There are two explanations: First, the water of Erhai Lake evaporates and rises upward, encountering the cold currents of the high Cangshan Mountains, turning into a strong wind that cannot dissipate (because Erhai Lake is surrounded by mountains on all sides). Therefore, in autumn and winter, a strong wind may blow several times a day. Second, in the southwest of Xiaguan, there is a narrow valley. The western Yunnan highway follows this valley through Yangbi to Baoshan. This valley is 80 *li* long, with high mountains on both sides and a width of less than 1 *li*. The air is suppressed by the high mountains, forcing it to blow towards Xiaguan. People from Jiangnan say, "It's like wind blowing down a narrow alley." The above are the sources of the wind. According to the people of Xiaguan, the wind comes out of a wind cave, but that is just a myth.

The wind is not terrible for the people of Xiaguan. The wind scatters the dirty air, scatters the dust and loose soil, and blows the weather particularly clear. People feel comfortable. Although the wind blows frequently, the weather is not cold. The people of Xiaguan proudly say, "The wind blows away the diseases of the people of Xiaguan and washes the town of Xiaguan clean."

Flowers

"The flowers of Dali." The county seat of Dali has the beauty of Hangzhou, the sweetness and tranquility of Suzhou, the simplicity of Changzhou, and the magnificence of Nanjing. Sitting at home, you can see the Cangshan Mountains and Erhai Lake. What is most enviable is that every house has a living spring coming down from the Cangshan Mountains, clean and convenient. This is a blessing that we people from Jiangnan cannot enjoy.

Speaking of the flowers of Dali, the late Xian Jiangyin, Mr. Xu Xiake, once recorded: "Going to the Three Pagoda Temple Mountain is beautiful... Above the spring is a large tree, which in early April, blooms flowers like butterflies, with wings and antennae lifelike, no different from real butterflies. There are also tens of thousands of real butterflies hanging upside down from the tree branches to the surface of the spring, colorful and dazzling."

Unfortunately, we cannot see such beautiful flowers. According to the locals, the people of Dali hate people from other places coming to see this flower, so they cut it down. Now the tree roots are still there. The flowers we see now are camellias, peonies, etc. Especially in the "March Street," every family brings out the flowers they have grown to compete with each other in beauty. Camellias are as red as the setting sun, and peonies are as large as silver basins. The reporter has not fabricated anything. The climate of Yunnan is suitable for growing flowers, which is the biggest reason.

Snow

"The snow of Cangshan." "Cangshan has nineteen peaks, and snow can be seen on every peak." Indeed, no matter the season, spring, summer, autumn, or winter, the highest peak of Cangshan always has snow. If it rains a little at night, there will be snow on every peak in the morning. Cangshan rises more than 3,000 meters above sea level, and the highest peak has reached the "perpetual snow zone," so it is covered with snow all year round. When we look at the mountain from Fengyi County, it is like a tall man wearing a white raincoat, sitting majestically. If you look at it from Yangbi County behind it, the dark pine forest is draped with a white felt blanket. Therefore, the east gate of Yangbi is called "Snow Reflection Gate," which is very interesting. The snow reflected in people's hearts can emit purity, solemnity, calmness, and elegance. Although the top of Cangshan is covered with snow, the people at the bottom are only wearing thin clothes and still face the warm sun. Isn't this a miracle?

Local legend has it that General Li Mi of the Tang Dynasty conquered the south, and although he reported victory to the court, he later died in this battle due to difficulties in supply. Every time the sky is cloudy, the sound of people and horses neighing can be heard. Later, General Deng Zilong of the Ming Dynasty, who conquered the south, tasted the victory here and built a tomb for ten thousand people to commemorate General Li's achievements, and wrote a poem: "The Tang general conquered the south and reported victory, who pities the dry bones in the dim twilight? Only the impartial snow of Cangshan; drapes white every year to mourn the loyal souls." After that, the sound of people and horses neighing was no longer heard. "White snow mourning loyal souls" is a permanent memorial for us Han people.

Moon

"The moon of Erhai." Erhai is a long and narrow lake. The people of Yunnan have never seen the sea, so they treat the lake as the sea. This is not surprising, as they have seen little and hurried. Because the southwestern plateau is a region with few lakes and marshes, if I want to describe the scenery of rivers and seas, I remember a religious painting, "Jesus Preaching by the Sea of Galilee," with turquoise sea water, red mountains, and a sense of gravity and tranquility. Thinking of the Sea of Galilee in Judea, it is almost the same size as Erhai Lake, right?

What is good about the moon of Erhai? Because the wind in Xiaguan is strong, it blows away every trace of clouds in the sky, so the moonlight is particularly bright. In addition, the clarity of the water reflects under the moon, illuminating as if it were daytime. This is not even the best part. If it is around the 16th, 17th, and 18th days of the lunar calendar, when the moon rabbit rises in the east in the evening, the moon is as big as a wheel, slowly rising from the east mountain, turning from red to yellow, to white. The color of the water in Erhai turns from black to gray to silvery white. In just fifteen minutes, you are given an unexpected wonder. This is the most beautiful moon in the world.

The reporter lingered under the moon in front of Shenglu Park at the foot of Shenglu Peak, facing Erhai Lake. On the white wall are written the words: "Failure to defend the southwest is the shame of the Expeditionary Force." These words are still there. The war has been won, and the government has returned to its capital. We are still in western Yunnan. I also think of the moon over West Lake, the moon over the Huangpu River, the moon over Huangtiandang in Suzhou, and the moon over Taihu Lake in Wuxi. It is the same moon!

A bald pen cannot exhaust the wind, flowers, snow, and moon. I wonder if people who have lived in the bustling cities of Shanghai for a long time also have the elegance to appreciate the scenery of this pleasant land.

### The Hope for Genuine Peace

To the Esteemed Editor: Please grant me a corner in your newspaper to publish this letter, allowing ordinary people to speak a few fair words, vent this long-suppressed resentment, and make those who hang up a sheep's head and sell dog meat—those who use democracy as a smokescreen while pursuing selfish gains, promotions, and wealth for a small faction—realize that the people's voice is to be feared, and to examine their actions that harm the country and the nation. During the War of Resistance, we ordinary people suffered the destruction of our homes and the separation of families, enduring hardships and assisting the government in persevering in the war, hoping that after victory, the country would gain freedom, equality, and independence, and we ordinary people would be able to live and work in peace. Where there's a will, there's a way. After eight years of arduous resistance, victory was finally achieved through the blood and sweat of the military and the people. How joyful and encouraged we ordinary people were, thinking that from then on we could live in peace and work happily, couples could reunite, fathers and sons could gather together, and even our relatives and friends who sacrificed for the country's resistance could smile in the afterlife. Little did we know that things would turn out so differently. Although the invaders were driven away, internal strife arose within the family. The flames of war had just subsided here, and there the signal fires were lit again. Therefore, the government convened representatives from various parties and local notables to negotiate and deliberate together, to jointly plan the country's affairs, with the aim of building a modern, democratic, prosperous, and happy nation, and invited General Marshall from the United States to mediate the disputes. The conditions of the Political Consultative Conference were agreed upon, the truce execution teams were dispatched, and General Marshall returned, turning our ordinary people's disappointment and pessimism into excitement and joy. However, not long after, the war in the Northeast broke out, followed by the provinces of Rehe, Chahar, and Suiyuan, resulting in countless compatriots being displaced, dying in ditches, and a considerable number sacrificing their lives to guns and cannons. Transportation was disrupted, prices soared, factories closed down, production declined, there were strikes here and requests for leave there, the economy collapsed, and the people could not make a living. Officials lacked sufficient income to remain honest, and corruption became rampant; soldiers could not return home, and acts of banditry occurred frequently. Reconstruction lacked a plan, and nation-building became a problem. The country's situation was precarious, hanging by a thread! All those with a conscience could not help but weep. General Marshall came again, and the worthies and officials of various parties flew back and forth to resume their negotiations. Little did they know that the seven-day truce order had just been issued when conflicts broke out again in the Northeast on the eleventh day. They were negotiating on one hand and fighting on the other. The reason for this was that each had its own position, each had its own background. You were speaking for party A, and I was lobbying for party B, dreaming different dreams in the same bed, not prioritizing the interests of the country and the nation, which led to the discussions becoming more and more distant and the negotiations becoming worse and worse. Therefore, a folk song has recently been discovered in the countryside: "The lord says he is right, the lady says she is right. The lord is right, the lady is right, only the ordinary people are not right. Only the ordinary people are not right. You have democracy, I have democracy, the more democratic the country becomes, the more painful the ordinary people become." Gentlemen, you should know that your salaries and emoluments come from the people's hard-earned money. The foreign houses you live in, the expensive dishes you eat, and the planes you ride in are all taken from the people. The country is based on the people, and the people depend on food for survival. Even in ancient autocratic times, there was still concern for the people. Now that we have democracy, how will you treat the people? Gentlemen! You are happy, but we ordinary people are weeping. You are feasting, but we ordinary people are suffering from hunger and cold. During these ongoing negotiations, I, representing the truly pure ordinary people without party affiliation, propose a few points for your reference: (1) The country's territory must be complete, and its sovereignty must be independent. (2) Only the country's legitimate government can represent the country and exercise all the country's due powers. (3) The people should be supreme, and the people's livelihood should come first, not party interests. (4) Genuine democratic politics should be based on a constitution drafted by a national assembly and a legitimate government produced, not relying on guns, but on the will of the people. (5) A democratic political inspection team should be organized to investigate whether the Soviet Union is democratic and how democracy works in the UK and the US, so as not to be superficial and ruin this good political system. Only by truly practicing the above proposals can we be open and united. Only by practicing the above proposals can we realize genuine democratic politics and build a new China in the future. If we continue to repeat the mistakes of the past and do not prioritize the interests of the country and the nation, the country will be in danger, and you will be in danger. What good will it do you? Even if you can escape the people's punishment, you cannot escape the scorn of history! What do you gentlemen think? By reader Zhang Daquan.

Painful Reactions

To the Esteemed Editor: In the ten months since victory, the appeals and requests presented by the refugees of northern Jiangsu to major newspapers in the recovered areas and to relevant authorities cannot be considered few, but how much actual success has been achieved? I now believe that "begging" and "crying for help" are no longer timely. Fellow refugees! Please understand: society is so turbid, reality is so contradictory, "negotiating and fighting, negotiating and fighting," the officialdom is acting in a play, "united government..." (聯　政府　　　,), the parties are fighting for power, who will sympathize with us? Who will pity us? The world gives us only cold shoulders and silence. We are simply the country's vagrants, the society's castaways. What relief do we want, what comfort do we seek? Sooner or later, it will be the day of death. We have no choice but to petition the government for guns to automatically attack our hometowns. We want to be the support for the two thousand representatives who are petitioning in Nanjing from Zhenjiang. We want to catch up with the vanguard of Xu Hai (over a thousand people) who are returning home armed. We can no longer hesitate; we immediately call for unity. We have no political views whatsoever; we are fighting to the death with the devils for survival. We are by no means driven by impetuous courage, but completely by the facts that compel us to do so. Esteemed editor, my words may be too harsh. However, I must say—please forgive me—this is purely an expression of painful reaction. Respectfully submitted by reader Shen Shaosheng, June 11th.

Where Has Social Compassion Gone?

To the Esteemed Editor: Yesterday, I saw an appeal from a group of refugees in your newspaper's readers' opinions section, and I was deeply moved, to the point that my eyes were filled with tears. I am someone in the same situation as the author. The only difference is that the author is still able to study at Fudan University, while I am an unemployed high school graduate. I have been a refugee in southern Jiangsu for several months, drifting between Zhenjiang, Suzhou, Shanghai, and Hangzhou. I have tried my best to find a job to maintain the minimum living standard to avoid starvation, but in this time when there are more people than jobs, even some people with knowledge and experience cannot find work, let alone a greenhorn like me? Studying is something I dare not even dream of. At first, I used the money I brought with me, then I borrowed small amounts from acquaintances, and finally, I drifted along. Enduring hunger and starvation is common, and cement floors and temples are my old friends at night. I have appealed to all sides, but people have responded with cold shoulders. I have registered and applied for relief from relief agencies countless times, but the result is waiting for a written notice, which has disappeared without a trace! The country has abandoned us! It has kicked us, a group of probably useless people, out of society! Please, adults and gentlemen of society, do not neglect us, do not be indifferent, thinking that it has nothing to do with you. The unemployment of educated youth will increase social unrest, and joining the Communist Party will increase the seriousness of the situation. Social chaos and the deterioration of the situation will affect the safety of your positions and property! At the same time, I hope that the government will improve the relief organizations and strengthen the relief efforts, so that they are not just things that are nominal and benefit the intermediaries, but are agencies that enable capable people to make the best use of their talents and allow refugee youth to return to school and find employment. Otherwise, the responsibility for "forcing rebellion" should be borne by those who force it, and should not be the responsibility of those who are forced. Sir, a person with a sense of justice would not consider my words to be provocative, right? Respectfully submitted by Guo Xiu, June 10th.

### The Quiet West China Dam

— Chengdu, 5th (Air Dispatch) Guo Hong

During the War of Resistance, the West China Dam was always envied as a "Shangri-La"; and at present, although many people who have lived in the interior for a long time are going to the prosperous Shanghai in the recovered areas, the capital city with its officials gathering together, the classic-style Beijing, the clean and tidy Qingdao and Guangzhou, Wuhan, and other places, in a sense, given the terrible situation of the flames of civil war spreading everywhere and the general surge in prices, the West China Dam is still like a "Shangri-La".

The Current State of "Shangri-La"

The West China Dam is a "dam" – in the customary application of the word "dam", there is a great difference between the people of Sichuan Province and the people of Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces: in the latter, "dam" often refers to "river embankment", while in the former, it refers to "open space". —It is located to the south of Chengdu city, less than five hundred steps out of the New South Gate, so it is adjacent to the city area.

As soon as people enter the dam, they will immediately feel that they are in another environment, except for the sidewalks paved with pebbles or coal slag, there is very little so-called "Chinese flavor." What jumps into your field of vision first are those large buildings, its roof tiles are made in the palace style, the sides of the building are opened with rows of glass windows, and at the entrance below, there are wide stone steps, and below the stone steps is a lawn; the surrounding area also has a winding corridor: showing a majestic appearance. Trees are planted everywhere on the sidewalks and in the open spaces, and in spring and summer, there is a green shade, mixed with pink and light purple flowers, making it even more beautiful and moving.

The entire dam is about half a square li, all of which is the site of West China University. The school's facilities are extremely complete, with museums, physics and chemistry buildings, libraries, etc., all of which are available. There is also a towering spire-shaped building, which is the "clock tower", which reports the standard time on time; when it rings loudly, it can be heard a li away. Inside, there are also two lawns – which are also sports fields, the smaller one can accommodate thousands of people, and the larger one is more than twice as large as the former. In addition, there is also a large-scale hospital, an office of a bank, and various snack shops that have emerged in response.

But what is regrettable is that this paradise was not created by its own efforts, but was given by the Christian Church.

Melting Pot of Students

Before the war, there were only a few hundred college students on the dam, and more than 90% of them were from Sichuan; but after the war, Yenching, Qilu, Jinling Universities, and Ginling Women's College of Arts and Sciences moved here one after another, so the students' hometowns covered any province or city in the country. It is by no means an exaggeration to call it a "melting pot of students from all provinces." Not only that, in addition, there are several young boys and girls of British, American, and French nationality decorating it, and what is even more worth mentioning is this Indian lady, whose skin color and clothing are most noticeable to the people in the interior.

Sad Talk about the Academic Atmosphere

The author stayed on the dam for a semester and is not unfamiliar with the atmosphere and living conditions of the students here. A friend who graduated from West China University around the 20th year of the Republic of China once said to me with emotion: "When we were studying, most of our time after class was spent on the sports field or reading general books, but now the students, hum!" I know what my friend's "hum" represents. Generally speaking, the academic atmosphere on the dam is not very good. According to the author's observation, it is far worse than that of the students with less porcelain, and the extravagant life far exceeds it. What is the reason for this? That should be a long story, so there is no need to draw conclusions here, but the students' wealthy family economy is a subsidiary factor. Dating is their daily routine; dancing is even more of a daily pastime. At the dances held in some private houses here, the main guests are these young masters and ladies. Otherwise, they go in groups to watch soft Hollywood movies, and most of them can only feel it intuitively, lacking the ability to appreciate and criticize; the fashion of going to teahouses is particularly prevalent, often four or five people surround a table, put their feet up, smoke cigarettes, and play "bridge" games, which is really eye-catching. When the Allied forces gathered in Chengdu for a period of time, the licentious behavior of some female students was widely rumored; although it was quite discriminated against by the citizens and criticized by the media, it did not diminish slightly; some of them were naturally willing to fall, and some were forced to do so because of the difficulty of economic sources, but this is always equally painful.

The Schools Have Resumed

With the arrival of victory, the schools that moved inland have resumed their original locations one after another. Yenching University, Qilu University, Jinling University, and Ginling Women's College of Arts and Sciences all ended their courses in mid-April; as the host, West China University also took a vacation in early May because its professors and courses had reciprocal relations with various schools.

The first to resume were Ginling Women's College and Ginling Men's College, and the first batch of teachers and students set off for Beijing before the end of April. The former has now been fully completed, and the latter can also be completed before the end of May. The second is Yenching University, which opened the first batch of resumption matters in early May, and then shipped two more batches in succession, and is expected to end in mid-June. The most delayed and the most difficult is Qilu University. The current Shandong is the most severely chaotic province in China, and whether the transportation problem to Jinan can be solved is really very slim. Although the school opened a resumption train in mid-May, it was not going to Jinan, but to transport some of the teachers and students from Pingjin back to their hometowns. Most of the teachers and students are still left in Chengdu, and it has not been decided when they will leave, but the school authorities have issued a regulation, that is, they must report to the Jinan school before September 20. May these young students who escaped from the enemy's fire line not step into their own people's fire line again.

The Silence on the Dam

One evening, the author made a special trip to the dam for a tour. All the scenery is still the same, but the footprints of young people are scarce, the bright lights have been reduced, and the various bulletin boards are leaning to the east and west, with only a little residue left on them. Several snack shops were closed. At "To Play the Lute to a Cow" (the music practice room of West China University), the sound of a piano and the jade-like singing voice of a high-pitched soprano used to be constantly ringing, but now they are all silent.

In the twilight, I wandered on a wide and deserted sidewalk; the evening breeze blew through the tall green willows, rustling over my head; a feeling of shivering hit me, and I couldn't help but shiver.

### Answering Readers’ Legal Questions

(1) Gao Yuhua: Esteemed Editor: In the spring of the 22nd year of the Republic (1933), the reader and Mr. Shi jointly operated a certain business in a certain place, agreeing to end it in five years, and electing Mr. Shi as general manager, while I served as chairman of the board, not working in the business. Stock certificates were printed, stipulating the end of the term in the end of 1937. Unexpectedly, the July 7th Incident occurred that year, and the place was also a transportation hub, and it was not ended in time. Soon after, it fell into enemy hands. Because the reader lived in another county, I was unable to go there in person. The situation of Mr. Shi after the fall into enemy hands was unknown. After more than a year of inquiries from various parties, I learned that Mr. Shi had not suffered any losses, and had returned to the original site in a certain place to do business. I immediately asked him to end the business, but was refused. I was only given a certain amount of money for travel expenses, and I silently accepted it and returned because the place was under enemy occupation and there was no way to reason. After several letters of urging, he was ultimately ignored. After victory in the autumn of the 34th year (1945), Mr. Shi became even more unscrupulous, making a big show and actually resuming business at the original site under the original name. The reader immediately sent someone to go there and wrote a sincere letter, still hoping to maintain harmony, hoping to get a fair and effective answer, but they were ignored and returned. What steps should be taken in law to negotiate? Please provide an answer.

Lawyer Zhu Ya Kui answers: According to the provisions of Article 675 of the Civil Code, partners may inspect the partnership's affairs and property status at any time and may inspect the books. You can first check the accounts and then, in accordance with Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Litigation after Recovery, if it is obviously unfair, you can sue the court for a fair ruling on the payment.

(2) Chen Mingkang asks: Five years ago, my father used 300 yuan in legal tender in his hometown to mortgage a building from a certain gentleman. The contract was for five years, and both parties held a signed contract as proof. Now that the term has expired, the homeowner intends to declare that he will still use the original price of 300 yuan in legal tender to redeem the mortgaged house. However, the current cost of living is high, and the value of the currency cannot be compared with that of five years ago. How should this be resolved? Please advise.

Lawyer Zhu Ya Kui answers: In accordance with Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Litigation after Recovery, if it is obviously unfair, a request can be made to the court for a fair ruling to increase or decrease the payment.

(3) Wang Dejun asks: My husband and I have been married for more than 20 years, and we have a large number of children, and the eldest son is already married. Unexpectedly, in recent years, my husband has ignored the family's expenses. Upon careful investigation, I learned that he has an affair. Now I have the following questions, please answer. (1) Now that my parents-in-law are still alive, can I ask my parents-in-law to transfer the family property that my husband is entitled to under his name to me, for safekeeping and as marriage expenses for my children? What method should be used to request the transfer in order to be effective? (2) If we divorce and request alimony, but my husband has no cash, can I request that the aforementioned property that my husband is entitled to under his name be transferred to my custody? (3) Although my husband has an affair, he has not made it public. If I unilaterally request a divorce, what method must be used in order to be effective?

Lawyer Zhu Ya Kui answers: (1) Inheritance has not yet begun and cannot be transferred. (2) Not possible. (3) In accordance with Article 1052, Paragraph 2 of the Civil Code, there must be evidence in order to request a divorce.

### Service Briefs

Providing Diagnosis and Treatment for Poor Female Compatriots: Esteemed Sirs: Due to the increasing prevalence of cholera in our hospital, if we do not take precautions quickly, it will inevitably spread. Therefore, we are providing free preventive injections, diagnosis, and medicine to poor female compatriots, starting on June 14th at 36 Xiangshan Road, 12 Yingshi Road, from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM; 66 Le'an Road, Hongkou, every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM. We specially request your newspaper to disclose this information on our behalf, so that the public may be aware. We are deeply grateful. Respectfully submitted to Shen Bao Social Service, Renhe Hospital, Shangxian Women and Children Hospital.

Lu Shoushan Asks About Ship Schedules: Esteemed Sirs: My relative currently lives in the countryside in Wuxi and intends to go to Shantou to visit relatives this month. Because the departure dates of the various shipping companies are only published in the newspaper three or four days in advance, those who live deep in the countryside, by the time they learn of the ship schedule and set off for Shanghai, may miss the opportunity to purchase tickets or not be able to arrive before departure. If they come to Shanghai to wait for the ship, the burden would be too heavy. We have always admired your organization's sincere service. Please answer: (1) Is there a fixed cycle for ships sailing to Shantou? (2) How many ships will sail to Shantou this month?

(Our newspaper's shipping reporter, Qu Nian, answers):

China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has one ship per week, and Jardine Matheson and Swire, two British shipping companies, also have ships sailing to Shantou, but the dates have not been determined.

### Masked

— Shao Fu

In Beijing opera, there's often the line, "This humble one is guilty and dare not raise my head." Why dare they not raise their heads? In a word, it's because they "can't face people."

Yesterday, when Ren Xingya and Shao Jigao were taken into custody in the grain and goods case, reporters followed and took photos one after another. However, Ren and Shao each used a newspaper to cover their faces. What was the purpose? They feared "losing face"!

This kind of thing is very common. We news reporters often encounter roundabout requests, such as, "The news can be published, but please be lenient with the photos." The so-called importance of face is probably especially evident in such situations. Otherwise, prisons must have roofs and ceilings, right? Why would those traitors need American sunglasses? (See the "News Small World" section of the 18th's edition).

We all know that after a person dies, before the body is dressed for burial, customs dictate that a piece of paper is placed over their face. Some say this is to prevent other animals from passing by; the deceased senses their breath and becomes a walking corpse. Another explanation is that the dead person's face is unsightly, which would cause their family—the living—to have ugly and terrifying thoughts, thus reducing their feelings of grief. In my opinion, the latter explanation is more rational, more scientific, and the basis for the saying, "dying to save face" probably lies here.

I remember in Japan, the entire head of a condemned prisoner is put in a bamboo basket. The intention is the same. This seems more lenient than our practice of parading criminals through the streets. In fact, the law originally intended to show them to the public. Before being taken to the execution ground, they're given a large bowl of wine and a large piece of meat, focusing on the practical and preserving face for that brief moment. It's truly incomprehensible. Matthew 23:25 says:

Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess.

### Drinking Coffee

— Fang Jun

That afternoon, before three o'clock, my younger uncle and I went into the basement of a large building, chose a sofa seat to the left of the "Clever Man," and each ordered a cup of coffee—the first time I'd tasted it in over three years.

Although I'd lingered on the brink of starvation, and could say I'd never really eaten my fill during the war, I'd often been able to get my hands on coffee. First, of course, was that I liked it, and second, friends often treated me. When friends treated me, I didn't have to spend money, but if I liked it myself, I had to save three coppers from my food allowance. (Coffee was three coppers a cup by the roadside before). Although it wasn't as delicious as when friends treated me, it was still a consolation and better than nothing, better than "passing a butcher's shop and just smelling the meat."

I never imagined coffee would become extinct and replaced with roasted black bean powder, which was so bitter and astringent, it was no different from drinking "Wang Lao Ji" bitter tea. Moreover, the "Clever Man" had changed its sign, and going there might even lead to some panic. Therefore, I became estranged from that place for several years. Actually, lingering on my last breath in a place where I didn't know where I would die, I couldn't help but turn my thoughts to drinking coffee.

The essence of coffee is, of course, bitter. A long time ago, when I was wandering the mysterious streets of Shanghai, I often went to drink bitter coffee, wanting to understand the taste of life from its bitterness and astringency. But roasted black bean powder doesn't have this profound bitterness, just like "Wang Lao Ji" bitter tea, you can't taste the bitterness and astringency that you find in coffee. Therefore, I symbolized this taste as coffee, and only those who drink coffee can understand the true essence of life. Thus, I thought that the true essence of life could be symbolized by coffee, and coffee became a product of urban culture.

Unfortunately, I was cut off from coffee for several years, and I was thrown into a deep abyss, an ice cellar, almost unable to be reborn.

Today, it is related to me again. It can be considered that world humanity and justice have been extended, allowing me, who was trapped in the darkness, to see the national flag and the light of day! So I especially cherish the cup of coffee brought by the waiter from Wenzhou, wearing a white shirt and black pants with the trousers tied up.

Facing the coffee—the cup of coffee placed in front of me—I was in a trance, staring at it, intently staring at it, loving it, lovingly and eagerly in my heart, a smile that I haven't shown for many years spread across my face, the corners of the old and withered skin of my mouth simply hanging like that, could reveal how happy I was in my heart. I forgot everything, my heart, mouth, and eyes were really only on the cup of coffee in front of me.

Coffee lifted my spirits in illness, and it also filled my strength in illness, while I drank that cup of coffee.

It seemed that I was no longer sick when I finished drinking that cup of coffee.

I became strange, and flashed suspicious eyes at the empty cup of coffee, but obviously I was in high spirits because of it.

But my illness will not be cured. How can a cup of coffee cure my illness? It's just that old friends have reunited, and the depression that has been built up for a long time has been opened up a little.

I planned to have another cup, but my uncle insisted that I have some "Western pastries."

I couldn't refuse, and took a bite of the cake. The softness, tenderness and sweetness of the cake can be said to be another kind of life.

However, I don't need to understand the taste of a cake-like life, and I don't want to understand it either. Because I have passed the cake-like life, and it has passed long ago.

### Analysis of Crimes of Passion

— Dongfang Jing

To avenge a woman's infidelity or her firm rejection of his love, older men often murder the woman to vent the anger in their hearts. But young perpetrators of crimes of passion mostly murder their rivals in love, usually stemming from verbal insults during arguments.

This is the conclusion reached by Dr. Bo Road and Dr. Fox of the University of Illinois in the United States, after studying two hundred perpetrators of crimes of passion over five years.

In southern Michigan prisons, the average age of perpetrators of crimes of passion is higher than the average age of general prisoners. The former is thirty-four years old, while the latter is just over twenty-nine years old. The education level and intelligence of perpetrators of crimes of passion are very low.

Older people commit more violent acts due to jealousy than they do when committing crimes due to other motivations, while young perpetrators of crimes of passion are the opposite.

### Sacrificial Items

— Yingdai

During grand sales with discounts and price reductions, shops typically designate a few items with price tags labeled "sacrificial items."

"Sacrificial item," what a stimulating term! The so-called sacrifice means that this type of product is sold at a price lower than the cost. It is specially selected to treat customers favorably. Therefore, everyone who sees sacrificial items in the display window has to stop and take a look. If the item is truly cheap and useful, they will unconsciously go in to buy it.

I consider myself a careful friend when buying things. Sometimes when I need a certain item, I will run to several stores, constantly looking at the display windows to see which one is cheaper. The saying "compare three stores and you won't suffer a loss" is, in my opinion, the principle of purchasing goods. Therefore, I have tried a few times with sacrificial items. But as a result, I have gradually become less stimulated by them and do not trust them. Now I am even more convinced that all sacrificial items are not cheap goods.

The reason why I am indifferent to sacrificial items to the point of not even bothering to look at them is, of course, not without reason. In the past, when I went to buy sacrificial items, I often suffered the pain of being squeezed out. Some stores, if you go a step late, will tell you that the time has passed and come tomorrow. Some stores, facing a group of customers in front of them, pretend to supervise strictly, slowly handing out the items, and even choosing acquaintances to give them to. When the time is up, or the goods are gone, they say "see you tomorrow," and you have squeezed for half a day in vain. Like a dumb person eating Coptis chinensis, there is no place to complain.

Even if you can sometimes buy them, the toothpaste is lumpy, the socks are discolored, the clothing material has holes, the food has a smell... everything is somewhat spoiled and cannot be sold as good goods, so it is used as a sacrificial item. What is the use of buying this kind of thing? Although the price is cheap, you are actually being fooled. But if you are fooled once or twice at most, you will naturally become indifferent to sacrificial items and will not be fooled again.

People who want to buy cheap goods are originally foolish worms. Who doesn't want to make money when opening a store? And who is willing to lose money? If you want to buy something that is even less than the cost price, your starting point is wrong. Otherwise, where would those big bosses get their foreign houses and cars?

From sacrificial items, I extrapolate to big discounts and big sales. How many truly discounted goods are there? Most of them are also second-rate goods. Are the prices of clothing materials that offer three yards or buy one yard get one free the same as those that do not offer a discount or a free gift? I have seen several stores that have been half-open all year round, covered with red and green paper strips, holding closing down sales, but they have not closed down after seven or eight years. Well, all of this is the gimmick of merchants, otherwise how could they attract so many customers to the door? Sacrifice has a price, and so does sacrificing goods.

### Two Mas Fight, Affecting the Dance Floor

— Feng Yi

The Hong Kong Star East Football Team came to Shanghai to compete, and by last Saturday, they had played four games, with a total ticket revenue of over 70 million yuan. Star East received 48%, Yiyuan Stadium's venue fee was 30%, and the Football Association received 22%. It is expected that when the entire schedule is completed, each member of Star East will receive around 5 million yuan, excluding expenses. The number cannot be said to be small. But compared to the amount of 900,000 US dollars that American black boxing king Joe Louis can get in a boxing match, one cannot help but feel that this is a small matter compared to a big one. However, compared to the current treatment of public officials, 5 million yuan is equivalent to two years' salary, so it is more than enough compared to those below.

According to side reports, this autumn, ball king Li Huitang also intends to lead the Hong Kong South China team to Shanghai for competition. From this point of view, Shanghai is still a "golden world."

Nanjing newspaper reported: Liu Kai, a famous gambler nicknamed Liu Three Swords, was recently searched by the police, and two mahjong tables were seized on the spot. Among the eight gamblers, there were five nuns. Some say that the nuns gambling is because their mortal heart has not receded and their six senses have not been purified. I say: "Mortal heart" and "six senses" are too abstract. After all, nuns are also people. The empty door is lonely, and it is inevitable to move the pole of thought. However, the other three gamblers who approached the empty door have a bit of Bodhisattva heart.

Han Lingen's participation in "Home of Loyalty" has been gradually calmed after Wu Yonggang published a defense. It is heard that the view of the filmmakers who went against the Party on this matter is: "I am afraid that the Shanghai movie stars will take back the territory." Right or wrong, let's not discuss it for the time being, but in my opinion, it is best to have fewer nobodies in the Home of Loyalty!

Chief Chen has recently issued an order: Jeeps are not allowed to carry girls in the future. If Shanghai can also implement this, at least the incidents of hitting people can be reduced somewhat.

Since President Ma of the Central Daily News in Nanjing attacked extravagance and decadence, and Mayor Ma ordered the banning of dancing, the dance halls have closed down one after another, seeking a way out, changing to performing Qingchang, and competing to hire singers as a gimmick. The "Metropolitan" dance hall has been leased to the First Engineering Office of the Highway Administration of the Ministry of Communications, serving as staff dormitories, with an annual rent of over 10 million yuan. Someone said it wonderfully: this is the result of "two Mas fighting, affecting the dance floor."

### American Rice

— Deng Xi

There are really many American goods that have come to China with victory: Jeep cards, khaki cloth, American flour, American silk, American butter, American milk powder, American beer, American coffee, American suits, American combs, American glasses, American belts, ... and recently advertisements for American rice have appeared in the newspapers.

The Chinese people's clothing, food, housing, transportation, and things to use, play with, and ride in... everything is supplied by American goods here, which are cheap, high-quality, and fashionable.

The fashionable men and women walking on the street are chewing American bubble gum "click, click." This is Americanizing life, which is both fashionable and glorious, and now the rice they eat is also American goods. It seems that this American rice has grains as big as dates, as white as snow, as fragrant as ginseng fruit, and as soft as... and the top-notch white japonica rice, which has always been valued by Chinese people in Shanghai, will also be defeated.

When entertaining guests, when serving the rice, the host solemnly introduces "This rice is cooked with American rice." How loud, how fashionable, how glorious?

The emperors of history enjoyed all the delicacies of the mountains and seas, but they never ate foreign rice. Now, we ordinary people who can enjoy American rice are better off than the emperors in terms of taste, which is really enough to be proud of!

When eating American rice again, I don't know if there is a description—a leaflet—recording its method of eating. We would really like to learn and try it.

### Remembering Mr. Zhu Shaoping

— Bao Zhongqi

Mr. Zhu Shaoping was brutally murdered by Japanese pirates while serving as a consul in the Philippines. His death was on April 17, 1942. It was not confirmed until recently that he was forced by the enemy to dig his own grave and then buried alive. At the same time, all walks of life in this city also held a memorial service for Mr. Zhu Shaoping at the Pudong Native Place Association. Thus, this generation of educators passed away forever.

I got to know Mr. Zhu Shaoping at the Global Elementary School. At that time, he was living in seclusion in Shanghai, in charge of the progress of the Global Student Union, and concurrently serving as the principal of the Global Elementary School. He devoted his life to education and journalism, and served as the chairman of Qixiu Women's Middle School; during the revolution, he was the initiator and leader of the "Southern Society," and Liu Yazi would probably have to be mentioned after him. He made the greatest efforts in the work of promoting the revolution. During the "May Fourth" student movement, he personally led the students to run around and appeal, even neglecting food and sleep, and weeping bitterly. His spirit influenced us a lot, and his contribution to the country can be said to be very great. Unfortunately, the Philippine Islands were captured by the Japanese army, and this great old man finally died for the country.

He was serious and meticulous in running education during his lifetime. Even the most trivial things, he handled seriously and would not neglect them. For example, he would personally go to the toilet every morning to inspect it. The students often laughed at him, but he still seriously regarded it as a routine daily task. If the toilet lid was not put down properly, or the walls were covered with boring words, then he would make a big discussion at the memorial week.

Speaking of memorial week reminds me of an interesting incident. His native accent was very heavy, so the word "Zhu Wei" (各位) was often misheard as "Cifan" (粢飯, a type of rice roll). Once he said with emotion during the memorial week: "The Chinese are often so poor that they can't even afford porridge for breakfast." Then he wanted to get proof from the students. Sure enough, a student replied in a very sincere tone: "Cifan is indeed like this." The audience burst into laughter, but he said very seriously: "This is really an unfortunate thing, how can you still laugh?" It can be seen that he was loyal. At that time, Mr. Zhu's age was quite high, and his bald head was very bright under the light. The students jokingly called him "light bulb," and he never got angry.

A Few Words Collection

### Concubine Technician - Taiwan is Making a Lot of Noise

— Wuling Ren

Hearing that Yijiangmen in Nanjing will be changed to Arc de Triomphe, I remembered the many stone steps of the Arc de Triomphe outside the Military Commission on Linsen Road in Chongqing. After walking all the stone steps, I was already sweating profusely and my legs were limp. Indeed, if we are only afraid of leg limpness and are unwilling to sweat, we will not even think about passing through this glorious and great Arc de Triomphe.

After the victory, Hua Nan cultural traitor Li Pingfu will issue an obituary to feign death and hide in Hong Kong. It is recently learned that he has been included in the first batch of traitor lists by the Guangzhou Military Camp. Li then issued an obituary recently and instructed his family to observe filial piety and implement the second feigned death. I don’t think it will work. The so-called think three times before you act (sound of 思死 is harmonious), of course there will be one more death. As for whether the third time is a feigned death? Still dying of illness, or being arrested and executed? That depends on his "forehead."

This city's imports in April exceeded exports of local goods by twenty times. In today's post-war domestic material shortage, it is a good phenomenon, because while desperately dragging in, while staying without going out, there is hope for abundant materials, which is in line with the "increasing revenue and reducing expenditure" principle, why bother to worry about things that have not happened.

It is said that the Taiwan Provincial Assembly pointed out the points for the government to improve, and the most fierce question was the fact that the concubine of Director Ye of the Inspection Bureau was filled with a technician, which made a lot of noise. It must be denied that it is a matter of admiration that the concubine can support herself, if she can really be competent.

### Idle Talk About Young Masters

— Jinghua

Shanghai people always like to call young people young masters, and at the same time they are quite willing to accept them. Whether they are real young masters or fake young masters, they are full of vanity. They feel that only this title can continue to show their noble status. Therefore, vanity permeates Shanghai, east and west are young masters.

The beggars' cries of young masters aroused the joy of these young masters, and perhaps they will reward you with a hundred yuan ticket. The waiters in taverns and teahouses shouted a few times as young masters, in exchange for more small accounts.

But the so-called young masters; a group of real young masters, they rely on their parents' property, do not do their jobs properly, call friends and invite them to buy wine and have fun, spend all night indulging in pleasure, and squander their wealth. They don't know the difficulty of making money. They only have consumption and will not produce. This group of national dregs, social worms, and family parasites is the so-called young masters.

What is especially pitiful is a group of fake young masters. They are mostly junior staff members of companies or shops and have met this group of real young masters. In the carnival, someone called him a young master, especially the beloved woman, he was so happy that he forgot his identity. He needs to maintain the nobility of a young master to win the favor of a beauty. Luxurious clothing and lavish parades are necessary conditions for young masters, but how can a meager salary for barely making a living provide for his squandering? Before the end of the month, the salary has been overdrawn, "dying for face and suffering," first borrowing from the east and moving from the west, then pawning and selling, and finally perhaps staging a living drama of escape in the possible.

Young master, young master, what a despicable and shameful term this is!

### "We Want to Study!"

— Wei Hui

I remember a few months ago when Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua first arrived in Shanghai, a group of students marched and petitioned, shouting slogans loudly: "We want to study!" We feel that it is really commendable that there are still people shouting that they want to study in this era. To be honest, there are too few people who want to study these days. "Scholars" have become a special class in China, and this meaning seems to say that Chinese people can be divided into two categories: scholars and non-scholars. It's also pitiful to say that even "scholars" don't read books anymore. Students should be reading, but as far as current college students are concerned, we want to ask how many are studying? In the past, college students read reference books in addition to textbooks. Later, they only read textbooks, and now they don't even read textbooks. University professors should be reading books, right? But as far as I know, there are probably only a handful of people who still read books when teaching at universities. Those who have just come out to teach still flip through some reference books to prepare lectures. Old educators have used their notes from their studies abroad twenty years ago to become authorities, and it seems useless to read books anymore. As for others, businessmen don't have the time to read books, workers don't have the strength to read books, and ordinary politicians and dignitaries have more important things to do than reading books, so they don't have time for this.

Fortunately, there are still two kinds of people in Shanghai who are reading books. One is the ladies and gentlemen of the leisure class and the staff of company agencies. The wives are unwilling to take care of the children because they want to read books; the staff also have to temporarily give up their jobs because they are reading books. It turns out that they are all reading the weekly newspapers of yellow news with anger and forgetting food! There is also another kind of scholars who are ordinary innocent children. They are unwilling to go home after school, save the money for eating candy, sit on the book stalls by the roadside, and watch speed loop pictures. This is their only spiritual food.

We often hear advanced educators shouting: "Down with book education!" They have succeeded. Long live the new educators!

### Family and the Civil Code

— Pan Guangdan

…Review of Zhao Fengjie’s Annotations on the Kinship Section of the Civil Code…

In the past decade or so, there have been quite a few authors who have written specialized books on the kinship section of the Civil Code. The works of Yu Qichang, Xu Zhaoyang, Yu Yi, Huang Youchang, Tao Huizeng, Cao Jie, Hu Changqing, and Zhong Hongsheng all appeared before or during the early stages of the War of Resistance. Zhao Fengjie's *Annotations on the Kinship Section of the Civil Code*, written during the War of Resistance but only recently published by the National Compilation and Translation Bureau and printed by Zhengzhong Book Company, is another addition.

The structure of this book is generally similar to other works of the same kind; that is, it mostly discusses or comments on the chapters, sections, and articles of the kinship section of the Civil Code in order. The entire book is divided into two parts: an introduction and a main body. The main body is further divided into seven chapters: general principles, family, marriage, parents and children, guardianship, support, and kinship council, each chapter containing several sections. Two appendices are included at the end: one is the review opinion on the preliminary points of the kinship law passed by the Central Political Conference of the Kuomintang, and the other is the interpretation examples of the kinship section of the Civil Code.

Compared with previous works, this book has many noteworthy features. From the reviewer's perspective, there are at least a few points that should be earnestly introduced to the reader.

1. The Family is the Center of Social Life

It is commendable that the author can pay full attention to the family system without undue emphasis or negligence. The family is the starting point of social life, as well as the center of gravity for social life, and even the true unit of social life. Whether from thousands of years of human experience or from the comparative scientific sociological theories since Comte over a century ago, it can be said that this has become a consensus. However, the drafters of the kinship section of the Civil Code, failing to observe the distorted development of the Chinese family system in the past, and misled by some contemporary trends of thought, threw the baby out with the bathwater, placing the chapter on "Family" in the sixth position, even after "Guardianship" and "Support," and the regulations on the family system are only a few. The author believes that this is a fundamental mistake that must be corrected. Therefore, in the order of discussion, he moved "Family" from the sixth position to the second position, immediately after the chapter on general principles, and explained this in the first item of the introductory remarks, saying, "Since the 'family' in our Civil Code is based on the principle of a community of relatives living together, it should follow the precedents of previous drafts and place it above 'Marriage' and 'Parents and Children'; moreover, according to the inferences of sociologists, it is also believed that marriage originates from the family, and it cannot be said that the family originates from marriage. Therefore, this book lists 'Family' as the second chapter."

This spirit of upholding a sound family system is consistently maintained by the author throughout the book. For example, regarding his view on divorce, he advocates neither excessive restriction nor excessive freedom. He says, "If divorce is too free, there will be no peaceful days for society and the family; therefore, in order to consolidate the family and seek the health of future generations, efforts should be made to reduce its occurrence" (p. 107). Also, regarding the adoption of a female child by a single man, the kinship section of the Civil Code does not explicitly stipulate anything. Previous legal scholars such as Hu Changqing advocated that adoption should be allowed, but the author believes that adoption should be prohibited in principle, and in special circumstances, the court can make a decision. This may not seem like a significant point on the surface, but it actually has a great impact. The increase in the number of single people is largely due to the lack of a sound family system in the contemporary era, and partly due to the consequences of an unsound family system. Although the principle of "no resentful women within, no unmarried men without" may seem old-fashioned, marriage is indeed a major condition for a sound personality and social stability, which is not necessarily a conclusion of modern sociology, and there are statistical figures to prove it. Therefore, to maintain the soundness of the family, the trend of singleness must be corrected at the same time. This is the first point. People who have the ability and interest to adopt other people's daughters as their own are in fact not fundamentally unsuitable for marriage. The prohibition of adoption in principle can to some extent reduce the tendency toward singleness, because if elderly men cannot attempt adoption, then when they are young, they cannot but make some plans for marriage and family. This is the second point. An elderly single man making plans to adopt other people's children may appear to form a family with a father and daughter, but in reality, it is not a true family. There is a difference between true and false that cannot be ignored. This is the third point. An old man and a young girl living alone in a room, nominally father and daughter, are actually like husband and wife. In terms of social morality and order, the law cannot but assume some responsibility for preventing problems before they arise. Hu Changqing affirmed this, believing that since the Civil Code has clearly stipulated that the age of the adopter should be more than twenty years older than the adoptee, there is usually no possibility of sexual or marital relations occurring. This is an impractical argument that only knows legal principles but does not understand physiology. The author has refuted this, and his views are very correct (p. 167). The reviewer can further say that sexual relations between an old man and a young girl are not only possible but also easy. When a man is around fifty years old, it is a major turning point in his sexual physiology. Actions such as marrying a young wife, having relations with maidservants, supporting actresses, adopting goddaughters, and even raping young girls mostly occur at this turning point. However, if a man within this age range adopts in name, how can one be sure that he has no other intentions? Or even if he sincerely adopts in the beginning, how can one guarantee that he will not change the relationship later? Every added example of change further erodes and shakes the entire family system. This is the fourth point.

For example, when the author discusses the issue of guardianship of minors, he advocates that, in addition to parents being the natural guardians, the position of the legal guardian should be prior to that of the testamentary guardian because the legal guardian is ultimately a member of the family, while the testamentary guardian is an outsider. He says that China's situation is different from other countries, "Large families still exist in rural societies, and even in cities, they are not all small families. Family affairs are often controlled by the elders in the family. Once the parents die, parental authority is exercised by the grandparents or uncles and aunts who are the heads of the family, which has become a customary practice. If the deceased father or mother designates an outsider as the guardian of their children, there will inevitably be conflicts between parental authority and the authority of the head of the family, and the closeness of relatives in the same room will be damaged, which is not good for the family."

2. Where Does the Center of Gravity of the Family Lie?

Since the family system is the center of gravity for social life, then to seek the soundness of the family system, the family must have its own appropriate center of gravity. This is another point that the book pays special attention to, and it is consistently maintained throughout. The point already discussed above that the position of the legal guardian should be prior to that of the testamentary guardian is also an example of this. The center of gravity of a family is in the parents. When the parents die, the center of gravity is lost, so there must be a legal guardian to re-establish this center of gravity. The testamentary guardian is an outsider, and in name only a guardian, and in reality, has nothing to do with the restoration of the center of gravity, so his position should be after the legal guardian. The author takes the same attitude toward the guardianship of interdicted persons; even if they are both legal guardians, the Civil Code places the spouse before the parents, but the author believes that "according to the circumstances of most Chinese families, cohabiting parents should be ranked first, followed by the spouse, and then non-cohabiting parents; and according to foreign legal precedents, the spouse is not always placed in the absolute first position."

The Civil Code stipulates that "husband and wife are each other's agents in daily household affairs." The author strongly criticizes this point, and the most important reason for his criticism is that he wants to maintain the center of gravity of the family system based on the ancient principle of "two things cannot be too great." This is very correct. The wife can be the husband's agent, and the husband can be the wife's agent, but it depends on the occasion, the need, and whether one party has a problem and must be represented by someone else, but to say that in ordinary times, at any time, in daily life, husband and wife are each other's agents, that is indeed inappropriate. The author gives an example, saying that if a husband or wife goes out to buy something for thirty yuan a day, according to the principle of agency, they must each be responsible for fifteen yuan. "If husband and wife haggle over every penny like this, it is worse than shareholders in a partnership, and what affection is there between spouses? Therefore, adhering to this view, this legal triviality is extremely restrictive of human nature and creates an unprecedentedly bad example" (p. 96). The system of separate property for husband and wife, in the last one or two decades, even those who advocate gender equality and women's economic independence most strongly, such as England's Linglishi, have begun to doubt it, believing that it is inappropriate in terms of emotion and reason. Now, if the legislator, in principle, advocates "absolute" equality between men and women, then economic facts must be separate property, and the law must have provisions for mutual agency. If economic life is like this, then other aspects of life must also be like this—an unsound view will inevitably lead to theoretical confusion and unsolvable problems, and practical difficulties are still a matter for later. This is also a very good example.

The theory of absolute equality has produced the so-called provisions for husband and wife to be each other's agents in the Civil Code, and the theory of absolute civil rights has created the article on the presumption of the head of the family—it is truly unprecedented. The author painstakingly maintains the principle that the family system should have its center of gravity and cannot remain silent on this. He says, "The presumption method greatly violates the spirit of the Chinese family... It is not known that the organization of the family is based on the relationship of grace and righteousness, unlike the organization of the state, which is threatened by power. Those whose grace and righteousness are exhausted can be separated; adults who are dissatisfied with the head of the family can also request separation. Since there is no legal provision to force them to form a family, why use the presumption method to ease the emotions of all parties? If the head of the family is actually stubborn and mischievous, their family members will avoid them, let alone use the presumption method to change the head of the family and live with them. Therefore, the principle of presuming the head of the family makes the original heads of families in society (those who are respected according to custom) feel uneasy, so as to shake the foundation of the family and violate the original intention of the law to maintain the family system..." (p. 420). This passage is very good. The question of who should have civil rights is important, and the method of election and presumption is very good, but anyone with a little common sense knows that it cannot be used in the family. The family is built on grace and righteousness, not on power. The state, which is built on power, has not awakened from its dream for more than twenty years. To this day, it still cannot adopt genuine elections or voting methods for the advancement and retreat of officials and the compliance of public opinion. How can one talk about implementing an election system in a family built on grace and righteousness! This is truly incomprehensible!

The current Civil Code places special emphasis on the obligations of the head of the family and does not stipulate any powers, not even the minimum power to maintain the peace and order of the family. Also, regarding family property, on the one hand, it formulates a system of property for husband and wife and allows the special property of minors, and on the other hand, it does not mention a word about the inherent system of family common property. The author believes that both of these are defects (p. 48-49) and are very detrimental to the center of gravity that the family should have. The generation of the head of the family places the primary emphasis on presumption. After the generation, he is not allowed to publicly have any power. He can’t even make a decision on the distribution and management of family property. A family like this, if they live together, can be said to be not even as good as an inn or an apartment. What is the use of it? The "family" that should have a center of gravity, according to the current Civil Code, will see the center of gravity gradually disappear until it cannot be maintained anymore. However, the "nation" that should be seeking a center of gravity in the same way has been constantly establishing a center of gravity for the past one or two decades, constantly implementing a policy of strengthening the "root" and weakening the "branches," completely forgetting that the roots and center of gravity of a democratic country are in the people, not in the government, in the local areas, not in the central government. Now, when we compare the family in the Civil Code with the actual country, we cannot help but feel a bit ridiculous.

3. The Dilemma of Civil Law Scholars

The problem of the family system has been going on for a long time. Sociologists and people concerned about social issues have been constantly discussing it. Civil law scholars, especially in the years when the Civil Code was being drafted, have also been discussing it very lively. However, it is easier for people outside of civil law to discuss it, and they can be less responsible. People who tend to be individualistic can thoroughly advocate small families, absolute freedom and equality between husband and wife, economic life, and other aspects of life. As for the details of the various relationships in the family, they can be put aside and not asked. It is easy to say ready-made theories, and it is difficult to solve practical problems. These friends are obviously taking a path of avoiding the important and dwelling on the trivial. As for the debaters who tend towards socialism, speaking seems even easier; the elderly go to nursing homes, children go to public nurseries, divorce is absolutely free, isn't there much reason for the family system to exist at all? I remember that someone wrote a specialized book on the family problem in those years, and the conclusion was to abolish the family. Once the family is completely wiped out, what problem is there? It was unprecedentedly decisive. (In recent years, these friends have seen that the Soviet Russian family still exists, the freedom of divorce is greatly restricted, and the childcare methods are limited to daytime only. At the same time, they have also formed families and become fathers, tasted some real joys and sorrows, and no longer make such decisive arguments.)

However, the position of civil law scholars is very different. It is not convenient for them to speak wishfully, and they cannot speak without thinking. They have to stipulate articles, write them down on white paper with black ink, word by word, and make them into a fixed law that people believe in and that can be passed down for a long time. On the one hand, they must take into account facts and experience, otherwise, having a law is equal to not having a law. It is either difficult to implement or a mere formality. On the other hand, they cannot but add some theories and ideals, otherwise, wouldn't they deny the leading function of the law, and ridicule themselves for being conservative, backward, and even reactionary? So our legal scholars who are responsible for legislation are in trouble. And even more unfortunately, the facts and experience of China's family system are like a large rock in the heart of the river, which is the most stubborn. The theories and ideals involving the family system at the moment are like a torrent in the river, which is the most turbulent. And those who are caught in the middle are none other than our civil law scholars. The reviewer has analyzed the awkward situation of their being in a dilemma and unable to move forward or backward when the law was drafted.

In fact, this dilemma can be avoided. Why didn't legislators consult with more cautious and down-to-earth sociologists and anthropologists before legislating? The first step is to have a more accurate analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of the past family system. The second step is to put in the same effort for the Western family system. The third step is to propose a revised plan based on the principle of promoting advantages and eliminating disadvantages. The basic principle of this plan should be to transform the inherent deformed development into normal development, and the so-called normal refers to making family life a great help to personal life and social life, and no longer a great obstacle. After everyone agrees on such a plan to revise the family system, then take the fourth step, which is the formulation of the kinship law.

In real life, there is sometimes a necessary need for some beneficial and interesting reading material. Whether you are a working youth or a student, you will have this feeling, right? Well, now I would like to introduce a book to you all - *New Theories on Sex Education*.

This book was originally written by Dr. Buschke and Dr. Jacob, two German medical doctors. It was translated into English by Mr. and Mrs. Eden, and then translated into Chinese by Dong Qiushi from the English version. The original authors are famous German medical doctors, and the English translators have worked on the new translation of "Das Kapital", which shows that this book is very valuable.

Of course, there are many sexology translations or works on the market at present, but after reading them, you can know that they are some hackneyed tunes, not works that seek to profit from erotic temptation, or their starting point is very incorrect, containing fantasy and exaggeration. After reading them, there will inevitably be various abuses, indulgence, and even self-destruction; so now I specially present this "New Theories on Sex Education" to discuss with you.

This book has an educational flavor. The first few chapters explain the anatomy of the male and female reproductive organs, the middle section explains the onset of spring love and sexual impulses, and finally it describes the origin of venereal diseases, personal prevention methods, and eugenics and hygiene. The ending is marriage guidance.

After reading this book, you will feel that you can gain some knowledge because it has a concise description of all departments of sexology and is accompanied by illustrations. It tells us many issues of benefit and harm, and supports monogamy. It says:

"We believe that the only correct path is to consistently move towards pure monogamy... A pure marriage is a common relationship established by a selfish male and a selfish female based on mutual attraction. After the close combination of the selfishness of both men and women, both parties do not regard selfishness as unique, because both parties regard it as a common selfishness... Seeking pleasure outside of marriage is not to destroy marriage, but to destroy the bonds of love..."

Indeed, monogamy is a good method, which is not only beneficial to the individual but also beneficial to society and the country. Its instructions should be implemented.

In short, it is a beneficial reading material. As the author said:

"History teaches us that after major wars and economic turmoil, during that transition period, decadent phenomena are particularly likely to be manifested in the field of sexual life."

Now, it is this transition time. I hope you will read it patiently!

### This Era

— Tang Juyu

By Luo Hong, a collection of short stories published by Zhengyan Publishing House

"This Era" includes eight short stories. The earliest was written in the 27th year [of the Republic of China, i.e., 1938], and the latest in the 33rd year [i.e., 1944], spanning five or six years. But these five or six years were all during the War of Resistance, so all eight short stories use the War of Resistance as their background. The War of Resistance caused extraordinary changes in the entire society. Those who were originally well-fed and clothed are now bankrupt; those who originally lived a peaceful life are now wandering; conversely, those who were originally destitute have seized the opportunity to climb up; those who were originally hoodlums and rascals have long developed into enemy running dogs and accomplices. The vicissitudes of the world are no greater than this, and the upward or downward trend of people's hearts has not changed faster, been expressed more clearly, or been more profound than at this time. What the novel wants to write and portray is people. Even so-called War of Resistance novels, apart from meaning the depiction of people during the War of Resistance, I really can't think of any other way to write them. Since no one can transcend the War of Resistance during the War of Resistance, writing about various people also reflects the various roles in the War of Resistance. The background of "This Era" is the War of Resistance, and what is written is people, but they are not extraordinary people, but ordinary people who are most often encountered in society, and therefore it also reflects the most realistic society in the War of Resistance.

"This Era" is very realistic. There are no tortuous stories or bizarre plots. Since the author focuses on portraying people, she only needs to let her characters reveal their inner thoughts and actions in the most unsurprising and ordinary things. The more unsurprising it is, the more intimate and closer we feel. Really, there are many people in this society like Wang Ba, Master Li Si (Wang Boyan and Master Li Si), Master Li San (Neighbors), Xu Zhaozhang (Friendship), and so on. Perhaps they are not like that on the surface, but they are all like that in their hearts.

The author herself said that she "often likes to write about" Wang Ba, "Master Li Si," and "that old protagonist in 'Neighbors'" (Postscript). These kinds of people are redundant people in society. On the one hand, they are pitiful; on the other hand, they are laughable. For example, Wang Ba is a ruined household, "lonely and helpless, even scolding people is disadvantageous." He scolds people "Wang Ba," but as a result, one mouth cannot defeat the mouths of the crowd, and he himself is instead branded as "Wang Ba." Such a big world, and only one Master Li Si calls his name. Master Li San in "Neighbors" is also a similar figure. His family property was destroyed by the war, so he had to rent out his house to scoundrels and rogues. Thinking of his own decline, he deeply hates the shameless fortune of his neighbors, and even opposes them using donations to enrich their own pockets. But in order to save face, he is willing to be blackmailed and reluctantly take out donations. This kind of muddled action is extremely human.

In another novel, "Snowy Night," the author writes about another typical old person, a bookworm who is obsessed with antiquity. But the war made him poor, forcing him to face the reality of life, causing him to produce intense love and hate. So he helps his nephew, who is a guerrilla, rescue comrades who were in distress during the War of Resistance, and righteously condemns his younger brother, who is a traitor to the country, displaying the true spirit of Confucianism. Although the author claims that the novel "Snowy Night" focuses on writing about young people, what she writes particularly well is this old man who can love and hate.

On the other hand, the author writes about intellectuals in the city. In "This Era," she writes about a mother who was very progressive in the May Fourth Movement but is now so conservative that she wants to keep her daughter by her side for the rest of her life. In "Demon," she writes about a wealthy woman who uses play to numb herself every day, but in reality, she has "a kind of inexplicable annoyance, a kind of rootless emptiness that often strikes her heart, and will climb to her heart for no reason" (page 160), endless emptiness, no love, no joy in life.

Since the author adopts ordinary stories to portray people's psychology, then this psychology must be portrayed deeply, which is necessary.

"This Era" is very good at grasping some realistic subjects to portray people, but in terms of depth, it is not enough. There is no obvious difference in personality between Wang Ba, Master Li Si, and Master Li San. The young man in "Snowy Night" is abstract. "Friendship" wants to talk about the snobbery after people get rich, but the people written about are too flat, and the result is only that people read a story. On the other hand, the mother in "This Era" and the wife in "Demon" who feels empty are sympathetic and understandable.

What is called deep portrayal? I think it is nothing more than human touch. There are no purely bad people, and no purely good people. We should extract a person's psychology from contradictions, carefully dissect him, carefully summarize him, and at the same time use the most suitable story to appropriately express these psychologies. The story is ordinary, but the consciousness is profound. Ordinary but profound requires the effort of genius. "This Era" has enlightened me on this point.

Spring and Autumn

### A Night's Chronicle

— He Fu

It was the early summer season, and due to daylight saving time, it was only nine o'clock in the evening, and the sky was already dim. Night began to envelop this gray and filthy alley. At this time, the electric lights of all sizes in the left and right neighborhoods began to emit light of varying intensity, one after another. Our five electric light bulbs also turned on almost simultaneously. My wife, child, and I had nothing to do after dinner, so we handed our tired bodies over to the worn-out bed.

On this bed, we used the events of the whole day, both small, like the family's livelihood, and trivial household matters, and large, like the country and society, as good material for conversation. We poor people always talk about food first. The rise and fall of rice prices are closely related to our survival. Not long ago, the price of rice suddenly jumped to seven thousand, and our humble dwelling reduced its meals from one porridge and one meal to thin porridge twice a day, and we were still uneasy all day long. Fortunately, in recent days, the price has gradually decreased, which is truly a great blessing from heaven. The tense hearts of the people have been slightly calmed. My wife said:

"The price of rice has fallen a bit today, and it continues to decline, which is always a good thing."

"Of course! Our hope is that after the price goes down, it won't skyrocket again. Because experience tells people that the past rice prices have gone through several periods of soaring and small rebounds before reaching the current market price." I replied.

"I hope that after this decline, the authorities can take further steps to eliminate this unreasonable price increase. It would be a truly virtuous act."

"Yes! The authorities are now acting swiftly and resolutely to eliminate hoarding and suppress rice prices. I believe that as long as they are determined and truly feel the life-and-death problems of the people, everything can be solved."

"..."

Next door was a leather shoe workshop, and the factory was buzzing with activity! The sound of hammering lasts, sewing machines, and chatting blended together. The old foreman hummed various tunes, including Beijing opera. They sang from: "The first month... is coming... it's the new spring..." to "Three lifetimes... of... fortune." Although the tune seemed a bit rough, they seemed free and happy, full of interest.

Our conversation turned to this side, and my wife said:

"It seems that those craftsmen live a more enjoyable life than ordinary people."

"However, they naturally have their own hardships. You and I are outsiders, so we are somewhat estranged!" I objected.

"As long as they have money in their hands, it doesn't matter if it's a bit harder. Only those who suffer endlessly but still can't fill their stomachs are the most miserable!" She stated emphatically to me.

"However, I think they get up early in the morning and work until late at night, and their income is quite meager!" I asked her gently.

She smiled and then shook her head, saying:

"Your estimate is wrong! The reality is absolutely the opposite. People just spend four or five thousand on cigarettes, alcohol, and snacks every day and still don't think it's enough! Not to mention supporting their families and letting everyone eat comfortably. You have to think about people like that A Gen; he has a wife and children in his hometown, and a mistress in Shanghai, running two households. He also likes to eat, dress, and enjoy himself! He has two apprentices under him, who learn the trade for three years. They learn in the first year and assist the master for more than two years. They eat bitter food and get a small monthly allowance. Other than that, the livelihood and wages they earn are all the master's. If they don't do well or are lazy, they will be whipped! A Gen foreman has six hands helping him make money. It is common for him to earn forty or fifty thousand a day." She paused slightly and continued, "Even ordinary foremen who don't take apprentices and rely on their own work to earn two thousand a day is not uncommon!"

I, with a surprised look, constantly shook my head to express disbelief! However, she had facts to persuade me:

"A Gen foreman's ups and downs in each mahjong game are always close to ten thousand, this is the first. A Gen's wife and his mistress have gold bracelets on their thick arms and gold rings on their fingers, which have been accumulating, this is the second. A Gen recently bought more than ten acres of good farmland in his hometown, which he personally told people, this is the third. Based on these three points, you can know how much A Gen earns every day!"

I have also heard these things from neighbors. Over the years, due to the high rise in prices and the constant increase in wages, A Gen foreman has been full of smiles all day long. He is truly said to be happy and content. Indeed, he has recently become even fatter than before, and his clothes are also better than before! Yes, I should admit it!

I was silent. I began to feel ashamed, ashamed of myself for being so useless! I began to regret why I had read so many useless books? My grandfather's teachings floated in my mind:

"Children! You are still young. Reading a lot of books will not necessarily earn you food. Children should be apprentices and learn a craft. A craftsman will not starve to death in a famine! It's good to eat well without knowing how to read, but it's not good to be without a craft!..."

The facts are before my eyes, and the old people's words are correct.

Otherwise, if I had followed my grandfather's words when I was young, whether I had followed a carpenter, coppersmith, bricklayer, or shoemaker! Even if it was a bit harder, just three years of apprenticeship would not have burdened me to this day? However, in this society, there are countless people who are full without fortune and have a share in starvation! Like me, I am just one in ten million.

The child snuggled in her mother's arms, sleeping soundly.

"Wen'er is already two years old! So lively, so innocent! She doesn't know the immensity of the sky and the earth; the ways of the world and human feelings, her parents' bitterness. When she sees people eating meat, her little mouth often hums: "Meat, meat"! In fact, God knows; her parents really feel sorry for her! We coax her every day: "Buy it tomorrow," "Mommy will buy it tomorrow"! She responds with "Oh, oh," which is so pitiful! As for when we can spend thousands of dollars to buy a pound of meat for everyone to eat, I really have no confidence and dare not think about it." My wife said sadly, seemingly with endless bitterness.

I hesitated for a while and slowly said, "I always hope that fate, our fate, will one day turn for the better, and all the problems that cannot be solved will naturally be solved..." But in reality, I often think of our fate, this tragic fate that is suffocating, which has been going on for nine whole years. In these long years, what day has been a good day of peace? It is said that the country's final victory has long come. We ordinary people never want any luxurious enjoyment in life. We only ask that the country be truly peaceful; everything can proceed on the path of reconstruction calmly. Coarse vegetables and white rice, a peaceful life, being able to live a lifetime is enough to be satisfied. But, but the affairs of the world are always difficult to fulfill people's wishes! Opening my eyes; it's such a chaotic world! It's so terrifying, so terrifying!... What will happen in the future? Who dares to imagine?... I have many things to say in my mind, but I can't say them, and I remain silent.

The night was deep. I pushed open the window, the sky was pitch black, and the sound of people gradually quieted down. The evening breeze blew in, still carrying the coolness of late spring. My mood was uneasy and I found it difficult to sleep peacefully...

Suddenly, a series of clamorous noises came from next door. I pricked up my ears and listened carefully:

"Mommy, Mommy!" It was a female voice, Zhao Di's voice.

"Auntie, Auntie!" Mao Ying from the front building was shouting madly!

"Sister-in-law, sister-in-law! What's wrong with you!" A mournful cry.

"Oh, Mommy, Mommy, Mom...my..."

"Auntie! You...you...you wake up! Wake up!"

Immediately after a commotion, there was a painful cry:

"Zhao Di's mother! How could you...bear...to leave your children...and go alone...ah!" Continuing to sob.

"Mommy! When...will you be able...to come back to life...ah?" The tone was so sad.

...

Someone instructed, "There's nothing anyone can do! Everyone doesn't need to cry anymore! We should hurry and prepare for the funeral."

Then, the sound of chaotic leather shoes, moving tables, and moving beds lasted for a while.

My nerves were tense, my head was dizzy, and my hands and feet were ice-cold. I started to tremble. It was like I had just woken up from a nightmare. "Alas! Poor Zhao Di's mother—that kind and amiable middle-aged woman who had been suffering from lung disease for more than half a year. She died, dragged away alive by the demons of poverty and disease." I said to myself, containing my grief and holding back my tears.

My wife was extremely tired! She had fallen asleep peacefully. She was not awakened by the noisy crying. Let her sleep peacefully! There are still things to do tomorrow. My sister-in-law from the front building, with her eyes wide open and swollen from crying, pushed open the door and sat on the edge of my bed. I advised her not to be too sad! People who die cannot be resurrected. It's no use being sad again! Sit here and rest!

I asked her all sorts of questions. She was Zhao Di's best friend. She was very enthusiastic, and Zhao Di's mother's affairs could not be hidden from her. I appreciated her feelings, and she told me a part of Zhao Di's mother's story in detail. The following is her conversation:

"Uncle Wen! To tell you the truth, Zhao Di's mother is pitiful! She died unjustly...

"Last year, in June or July: the situation was not yet peaceful. At that time, Shanghai was heavily bombed. A bomb fell in Hongkou. She was working in a yarn factory at that time. Fortunately, she wasn't killed. She crawled out of the pile of ashes. Her life was saved! Later... Since that day in August, when Shanghai was celebrating with firecrackers, China had won, and the world was at peace! Zhao Di's mother was so happy that she shed many tears. Then, unexpectedly, within a month, her factory stopped work, and Zhao Di's mother returned home to sit and eat. At the same time, her husband was also dismissed by the company! The couple broke their rice bowls. She was worried and anxious, and her already weak body developed the root of the disease. Zhao Di's father did small business, but his luck was not good. He lost all his capital, and to add insult to injury, he was arrested by the police. He was heartbroken after being released and left his wife and children, not knowing where he went! It's been more than six months with no news. Zhao Di saw her parents suffering and could not think of a way. She went to people's stores to collect clothes to wash, but the money she earned was not enough to eat, let alone pay for her mother's illness. Her mother didn't want to spend her daughter's hard-earned money on herself. She thought that she would get better if she endured it, but unexpectedly today... Alas! Pitiful, sinful! Sob! Sob!" She said to this point and couldn't help but start crying again!

"Don't cry! Your own health is also important. So, what now? How will Zhao Di's mother's funeral be taken care of?" I took a long breath and asked her, comforting her.

The sister-in-law from the front building wiped away her tears and then wiped her nose to suppress her painful crying:

"What relatives are there to take care of it for her? I'm a poor ghost myself, and every day is like New Year's Eve. I worry day and night! I can't worry until dawn. Tomorrow, I can only ask Zhao Di to borrow some money from her relatives. We all rely on the heavens for food. We should do some good deeds and contribute a little bit. Let Zhao Di's mother have a thin coffin."

I nodded, without any better words to reply to the sister-in-law from the front building. A burst of flashes and disorder came before my eyes, and I couldn't help but feel sorrow from the bottom of my heart.

"What! Uncle Wen, you're crying too!"

"No, I'm not crying! I won't cry." I forcibly suppressed my emotions and smiled bitterly.

The clock chimed... chimed... loudly! It was twelve o'clock. The sister-in-law from the front building said goodbye to me. She was going next door to accompany Uncle. I watched her leave the room.

"When a person dies, everything is over! In reality, for people like us whose lives are worse than grass, living in this place at this time; living seems to be superfluous!... Originally, people living in the world, life and death are the most ordinary things. Especially for us mediocre, dirt-poor people, living is suffering, living is a sin! It's better to die peacefully, die cleanly?... Closing your eyes and mouth, everything is over!... I fell into a vortex of contemplation, dazed and confused.

"Zhao Di's mother is resting in peace forever! Thousands of 'Zhao Di's mothers' are following Zhao Di's mother's path...."

...

I was extremely tired! I closed my eyes and wanted to sleep quietly. However, the bloodsuckers (bed bugs) seemed to have immediately issued a "command" for an attack! Those hateful little animals emerged one after another from the decayed corners of the walls, cracks in the bricks, and the floorboards. At first, my arms were attacked first! Before I knew it, all parts of my body were being painfully bitten. I couldn't help but get up to search for them. The child's little hands frantically scratched at his calves, creating countless welts. It was so pitiful! It was hateful that these little animals sucked people's blood and slipped away, ran away! Those who were greedy and ate too much and couldn't escape the "tiger's mouth" were easily captured and killed on the spot! After death, a foul smell rushed straight into the nasal cavity. Once a bed bug was sucked into the mouth, it immediately turned into stinky blood, and the foul smell made people nauseous. We really turned pale at the mention of bed bugs. We couldn't catch them all, kill them all. They came and went, went and came! In an endless stream. Poor people are the most unfortunate. They don't have good food or clothes, and they suffer from "anemia." But bed bugs always "attack" patients with "anemia." I wanted to move to another house, but I didn't have any gold bars in my hand. I wanted to buy DDT, but the price was so expensive! Using "anemia" to feed bed bugs seemed like a destiny ordained for poor people. There was no way to avoid it.

There was the sound of a door opening outside. "Who is it?" I heard the landlady ask loudly.

"It's me!" A clear female voice replied.

"Mei Zhen is it?"

"Yes!"

"You're home!" Then she said, "How was it today?"

"It was alright! I earned six blocks of "Gold" from those two rotten sailors!"

"Good, good! Go to sleep early! It's not early anymore!" Continuing, "See you tomorrow!"

"See you tomorrow!" I heard Mei Zhen say goodbye to the landlady, then fumbled and walked up the stairs step by step; her leather shoes rubbed on the steps, and the surrounding walls and louvers rattled.

After the door closed, Mei Zhen's mother talked to her daughter.

"Zhen Zhen! You came home late today, you must be tired!" Her mother's tone was diligent and considerate. "Don't sit there and think wildly! Go to bed and sleep comfortably!"

"Mommy, I...I'm suffering... suffering!" Mei Zhen seemed to suddenly speak with a trembling, bitter tone.

"Why? What's the matter that makes you feel sad? Zhen'er! Don't cry, tell your mother, tell me what happened today?!" Her mother asked haltingly.

"Tell! Tell you...what use is it? What use!" Her daughter sobbed.

"Then, then you can't not tell your mother! Zhen'er! Don't cry! Tell Mommy, tell Mommy!" Her mother pressed.

I held my breath and listened carefully to Mei Zhen's sad story to her mother:

"Mommy! Today, I was unlucky. Two murderous, lecherous ghosts! Two shameless sailors, drunk in the company, abused me like crazy!" Her voice gradually lowered, "They touched me from top to bottom, bottom to top...I...I didn't dare to get angry with them for a few blocks of "Gold." I wanted to be strong, but I was never stronger than them. I had no choice but to endure in every way, swallowing my tears! Later, I still served them diligently. Unexpectedly...unexpectedly they took me to a rickshaw, saying they were going to a room! I was scared, I didn't want to! They said ten "Gold" could knock me down. I was so anxious. After I got six "Gold" as "hospitality" fee, I wanted to sneak out the back door. But our manager...boo...hoo...hoo!" She cried again.

"What did the manager say?" Her mother asked again.

"The manager...he said I didn't know how to deal with customers! He said: If every bar girl was like this, his company would close down early! You're not a beautiful Xi Shi, a Chang'e in the moon, untouchable. If you want to be a lady, go home! We don't need you here...I was so angry that I cried my heart out. Sister Jin Mei felt sorry for me and sent me out of the back door of the ×× bar...boo...hoo..." She continued crying, "On the way, I ran into three shady guys in Western clothes, chattering behind my back, saying some shameless vulgar things. They followed me, getting closer and closer. I panicked! I turned my head and said a few words to them. They cursed at me: Old goods! Old goods from the ××! Selling ×× goods, go look in the mirror! Specially eating foreign ××! Who wants to stalk you, their eyes are blind!... I, I saw them leave, then staggered all the way home..." She cried even more sadly.

"Zhen'er, stop crying! People want to sleep, don't wake up the neighbors! It's embarrassing." Then, "Alas! It's all thanks to your father, we didn't cultivate in our past life so we suffer in this one! What else is there to say." Her mother sighed with infinite emotion!

The mother and daughter talked softly about some private matters. What were they saying? I couldn't hear clearly! Before long, the lights in her room went out, and it was quiet!

I knew Mei Zhen's family very well. Her house and mine were only separated by a wall that was dirty, black, and full of cobwebs. Her father was also an upright and honest man before the war. He died in the year of the war! Leaving behind his wife and several unfortunate daughters. Her eldest brother was later motivated by patriotism and went to the interior. There is still no news to this day. Perhaps he lost his life for the country, or perhaps he is still wandering at the ends of the world, unable to return home! Her family has pawned everything they had over the years! Filling other people's stomachs. Her mother had no choice but to let her eldest sister earn bread for the family with her beauty in the dance hall. Unfortunately, her eldest sister also died later! According to the calendar, it has been almost two years. Her eldest sister died of syphilis. After her eldest sister died; her mother had sworn an oath to the heavens! She didn't want to see her second daughter follow in her footsteps. She hoped that her second daughter would slowly find a partner and have a good, lifelong home.

But now ah, now she is: The entrance is flying both Chinese and American national flags, and the neon lights of various colors illuminate the women underneath them—bar girls!

This was after the victory...

This was after the first National Day celebration after the whole city celebrated victory...

Her age was only nineteen!....

The night was getting deeper! I still couldn't sleep peacefully. I was afraid, I was really afraid of being tormented by these things again. But I closed my eyes. My mind was still not quiet, and a sharp squeaking sound of rats scurrying around pierced my ears. I opened my tired eyes again; three or five rats were chasing and jumping around on the beams in groups. Holes had been made in the walls, which were heavily stained with grease, and the rats came and went freely. From the front building to the back building; from the back building to the attic, they gnawed on the utensils and food. During the day, they hid without a trace, but every night, they became rampant at the same time! I tried to catch them, but their movements were faster than mine, and their senses were more sensitive than mine. They also had sharp teeth, which made me feel cold and dare not attack! When I chased them fiercely, they hid for a while, but as soon as the lights went out, they became active again!

Because of these rats running rampant everywhere, I had discussed countermeasures with my neighbors and decided to:

"Eight households will raise a cat together, specializing in catching rats at night!"

But the result was that the cat was afraid of the rats, and our plan was declared a failure! Therefore, without any other way to think of, we had to endure all kinds of pain and continue in a perfunctory manner under the smoky atmosphere and the rats' arrogance.

I vaguely heard the giant clock of the Jianghai Customs ringing. It was four o'clock. There were footsteps "stumbling" and "clattering" at the door.

"Pancakes and fried dough sticks, do you want them! Pancakes and fried dough sticks!..."

"Hurry up and go! It's late, there won't be anything good left at the market..."

"The sky is about to dawn! The stalls haven't been set up yet, how can we make it in time..."

The vendors started rushing to the "early market."

Looking out the window; the sky was beginning to show a glimmer of dawn, although it was about to dawn, it was not yet light!

This whole night was spent like this. If I said this was an unusual night, perhaps it was quite ordinary. If I said it was ordinary, then perhaps it was not ordinary at all.

Insomnia is a painful thing, but writing down so many painful things makes my heart especially painful and uncomfortable!....

### Small Odes of the Northwest (Three Pieces)

— Zhang Che

(1) Poplar

In the slow-coming spring of the north, the poplar is the first to reveal the news of spring. In the monotonous yellow earth plains of the north, the poplar is the only one that stands tall above the ordinary yellow-gray.

It is straight, never stooping to beg for pity from the wind and rain; it is tall, towering far above all the dull scenery. It is useful, being the most commonly used wood by the masses in the Northwest; it is green, and when the Yellow River is still locked under ice and snow, new buds have already struggled to break through at the treetops.

Strolling on the yellow earth fields, the rows of poplars in the distance resemble a patch of brownish-green morning mist. This is the most vibrant color on the earth! I praise the poplar because of its upright and unyielding spirit, because it is the first to bring the sound of spring's footsteps.

(2) Sparrow

When getting up in the morning, one doesn't know what clothes to wear to cope with the changeable climate of the Northwest; but when one hears the joyful and energetic chirping of sparrows, one knows that there will be good weather today.

The sparrow is a messenger, a happy messenger of the sun. Hearing its chirping, as one puts on clothes in bed, it makes one imagine the tall and vast skies; the hair-like light white clouds, the moist and warm breeze, the bright sunshine. And when, in response to its call, one goes outdoors, one can smell the fragrance of spring and receive the golden arrows of the sun.

I love the sparrow, like a prophet of all beautiful things.

(3) Doves and Kites

People who are tired of the road of life are unwilling to look up at the sky; people who are busy on the road of life have no time to look up at the sky; but spring is spring after all, and we have doves and kites.

Doves can have whistles on their feet, and kites can have bows. They will resonate with a distant and clear sound above people's heads, prompting you to look up at the beautiful sky.

I thank the doves and kites because they give people a little dream and lofty interest.

The black cloth on her head has turned into a white helmet, and she is wearing a pearl-furred sheepskin coat inside out. Thinking of her miserable life, Little Hong is heartbroken! Tears and snot mixed with the air she breathes, freeze into ice!

"Oh God! Open your eyes, please warm up the weather, if this goes on, I won't be able to live!"

Little Hong prays, sobbing! She has never felt so desperate as today! She thinks about how she won't get enough to eat even if she goes back to her own home, she thinks about how Liao Dong is still young and will need several more years to become an adult; and she thinks about how Liao Dong ignores her, perhaps because he doesn't like her; so even if she waits for him to grow up and get married, she will still be unhappy; therefore, she is beginning to feel impatient with life! She blames her parents for not being able to support her, why didn't they cure her to death earlier? Since they had to give her to someone else to raise, why didn't they find a good family? She shivers in fear whenever she hears the landlady's voice; and she is as scared as if she had seen King Yama when she sees the landlady, and her whole body breaks out in goosebumps. As she nears the Hall of Returning Spring, she gazes at her own home across the street. She wishes she could run back and cry to her parents, but she is afraid of making them sad, she can't let her parents suffer for her pain anymore! So she grits her teeth and still walks back to the Hall of Returning Spring.

Bao Ling is idle at the counter, rubbing his hands because he's cold. He catches sight of Little Hong returning and hurriedly runs over to help her unload the wet firewood from her back, and takes it to the kitchen in the back. This makes Little Hong very grateful! She often thinks: If Liao Dong were so considerate of her and helped her! She would be willing to endure even more hardship! But no, Liao Dong has no affection for her at all, he doesn't have it now, and he won't have it in the future! But why? Why is he like this? Has she offended him in any way? Does he think she isn't working hard enough in this family? She doesn't understand, she must find a chance to ask him, she can't die still confused! She makes up her mind.

"It's getting late, I'll help you cook dinner," Bao Ling says, starting a fire in the stove for Little Hong and filling the pot with water.

"Thank you, Brother Bao Ling, please fill the pot with more water. Once it's boiled, I want a basin to wash my feet, and then you can put the rice in to cook," Little Hong says.

"Little Hong wants a basin of hot water to warm her feet, she's really freezing! She takes off the black cloth on her head and sits in front of the stove, warming herself by the fire. The ice turns into water when it meets the heat, and her clothes are all soaked."

"I gathered so little firewood today, I'm afraid I'll be scolded again later," Little Hong says timidly.

"You shouldn't have gone out on such a snowy day in the first place. If she says it's too little, let her go and gather some herself," Bao Ling says angrily. "One can't be too unreasonable."
