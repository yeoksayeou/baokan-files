### Group Reports Unanimously Passed

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 31st] The Political Consultative Conference, after concluding the work of the National Assembly group at the last subgrouping on the 31st, held its tenth meeting at the National Government Auditorium at 6:30 PM, presided over by Chairman Chiang, to discuss the reports of the various subcommittees, all of which were unanimously passed. At today's meeting, 37 members, including Sun Ke, attended. After Secretary-General Lei Zhen reported the number of attendees, Chairman Chiang declared the meeting open to discuss the reports of the subcommittees on government organization, policy guidelines, military affairs, the National Assembly, and the draft constitution. Before the discussion of each report, two secretaries read them aloud. The Chairman then invited members to express their opinions. All resolutions were quickly and unanimously passed. Only Huang Yanpei, Zhang Lisheng, Dong Biwu, and Li Zhuchen made brief explanations regarding the Outline for Peaceful National Reconstruction. Mo Dehui, Fu Sinian, and Huang Yanpei expressed their opinions on the constitutional draft issue. Fu and Huang suggested that it be recorded and submitted to the Constitutional Draft Review Committee for study. After the reports of the various subcommittees were passed, Chairman Chiang stood up and explained the following two points: (1) The phrase "to form a revised draft of the May 5th Constitution to provide for adoption by the National Assembly," as stated in the report of the Constitutional Draft Group, may be misunderstood by outsiders. In reality, it does not affect the powers of the National Assembly. The National Assembly is not subject to any restrictions when exercising its due powers. However, the review committee should fully study it in preparation for adoption by the National Assembly. (2) The resolutions and policy guidelines passed by this conference are national in scope. All regions of the country, regardless of area or party affiliation, must abide by them. They should be equally effective in all provinces and districts and in the areas where the Communist forces are stationed, in order to achieve national unity of military orders and political orders, and to firmly establish the foundation for peaceful national reconstruction. The above two points are specifically explained, and it is hoped that the conference participants will convey them to the attention of the compatriots throughout the country. After the Chairman finished speaking, he declared the conference successfully concluded and then held the closing ceremony.

### Mao Zedong May Go to Nanjing, Zhou Enlai to Tour

[United Press, Chongqing, 31st] The Central Standing Committee held a meeting today, presided over by Chairman Chiang, and immediately passed the various resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. At the same time, a spokesperson for the Democratic League quoted Zhou Enlai as saying that CCP Chairman Mao Zedong may attend the State Council, and Mao will go to Nanjing when the council is established there. Zhou will also tour the areas controlled by the CCP to inform the public of the various resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and encourage them to support it.

### Disagreement on Railway Traffic Restoration; Difficulty in Completing Repairs by Deadline

[This Newspaper, Beiping, 30th] It seems that the cessation of conflict issue may soon be resolved. The current focus of the Executive Headquarters' work has shifted to restoring traffic, but there is still a significant gap between the opinions of the government and the CCP. The government advocates unified management of national railways, with order along the lines maintained by railway police. The Communist side expresses doubts about the neutrality of the railway police and advocates segmented management and segmented protection of the railway. As of now, there is no sign of convergence in the opinions of the two sides. Except for the Jinan area, where road repairs have begun, the repair teams dispatched to other lines are still staying at the construction sites, waiting for the two sides to reach an agreement before they can start work. Chairman Chiang once set a deadline of the end of February for the repair of the railways, but due to practical difficulties, it is uncertain whether traffic can be restored by then. The most difficult problem at present is the lack of sleepers. Because many sleepers have been dismantled and burned, it is impossible to import a large number of ready-made sleepers from abroad in a short period of time. Under the current situation where the government's political orders only extend to a few cities, it is also impossible to collect them from the countryside, which is extremely difficult. Although the demand for rails reaches 500 kilometers, most of them have not been destroyed and are easy to find. Furthermore, by dismantling the rails of unimportant branch lines, it can be barely managed. Fortunately, neither of the major bridges on the Pinghan and Jinpu lines have been destroyed. Although many locomotives have been bombed, they can still be barely allocated. In terms of personnel, the 6,000-7,000 members of the original Japanese field railway unit have been concentrated in Changxindian, Shijiazhuang, and Tianjin by the war zone after the ceasefire order and disarmed separately. There is currently a significant shortage of personnel. It is reported that the United States will send 300 railway engineers to China, which may solve some of the senior technical problems in the future. Ling Hongxun, who is exhausted from his travels, once told people that we have not yet obtained a single steel rail or a single sleeper from abroad. The difficulty in repairing the old roads is actually greater than building a new one.

### Plague Rampant in Northeast

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 30th] The plague (pneumonic plague) in the Northeast has been extremely rampant recently. It has been found in Taonan, Tao'an (Baicheng), Dalai, Tailai under Nenjiang, Fuyu under Jilin, and Tongliao under Liaobei. Airborne transmission is the most harmful. Although there is a newly formed epidemic prevention committee, both medicine and doctors are lacking.

### Important Issues Pending Resolution by the Mediation Department; Ye Jianying Flies Back to Yan'an; Traffic Unimpeded on Trains Between Northern Shanxi and Western Suiyuan

[This Newspaper, Beiping, 30th] (1) Ye Jianying will fly back to Yan'an on the 31st to seek instructions on important issues pending resolution by the mediation execution department and will return to Beiping in the short term.

Two transportation routes have been designated for the Communist army to freely transport food. The executive department will issue a formal communiqué on this matter. (3) Two executive teams departed for Chengde and Xinxiang today, and another team will go to Taiyuan tomorrow. Recently, a team will also go to Guihua, and the team leader has been determined to be Yin Hanchu.

[This Newspaper, Beiping, 30th] Conflicts in the Datong area have completely ceased. Since the 28th, trains between Datong and Taiyuan have been unimpeded. According to Chu Xichun, the commander of the northern Shanxi garrison in the Second War Zone, Fengzhen is currently the garrison area of the Communist army. The power supply there is provided by Datong. The Datong side is currently repairing and connecting the power lines to meet the power needs of Fengzhen. An atmosphere of peace has filled the Datong area. General Ma Zhanshan, a veteran of the anti-Japanese war, also said that internal conflicts have ceased and that peaceful national reconstruction is just around the corner. Qi Mengchun, the deputy officer of this headquarters, passed through the Communist-occupied area from Datong to Wuyuan on the 27th to work. This is the first time that our military officers have openly passed through the Communist area after the cessation of conflict.

[This Newspaper, Beiping, 30th] A reporter who went to Jining with the peace team said upon returning that there was no gunfire or damage to traffic in Suiyuan. The Suiyuan-Baotou road is smooth and traffic is unimpeded between Guihua and Jining. The railway is being repaired. Since the arrival of the executive team in Suiyuan, everything has improved significantly, and the prospects for peace are quite optimistic.

### Wuhan Textile Industry Prepares to Resume Production

[This Newspaper, Hankou, 30th] The textile industry in Hubei Province is second only to Tianjin and Shanghai. There were originally eight textile companies, with a total of over 300,000 spindles and 2,851 looms. Unfortunately, all of them suffered heavy losses after the war. Currently, six companies, including Zhenshi, Yuhua, Shenxin, Taian, Shashi, and the First Textile Company, are actively preparing to resume production by purchasing spindles and looms in the United States. In addition, Wuhan has 8,000 tons of coal in stock. The source is now increasing, which will accelerate industrial recovery.

### Prices Stabilizing in Nanjing

He was also deprived of his civil rights for life.

### New Salt Administration Program Submitted to the Executive Yuan for Review

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] Miao Qiujie, Director of the Salt Administration Bureau, will return to Nanjing after the Spring Festival. Only sixty personnel of the bureau have returned to the capital, while more than three hundred and fifty remain in Chongqing and will come to Nanjing in batches starting next month. The twenty-eight articles of the new salt administration program have been submitted to the Xiao Executive Yuan for review and will be announced after approval. It is reported that the basic principles of the new salt administration program take into consideration both international and people's livelihood. After the implementation of this program, the production methods in salt-producing areas throughout the country will gradually move towards collectivization and modernization, and transportation methods will also be improved with the times. In the initial stage of the reform of salt administration, production will continue to be under control, and the distribution system will also be temporarily maintained, but a gradual opening policy has been adopted in order to achieve the goal of tax collection at the warehouse and free trade.

### Chairman Chiang's Closing Remarks: Harmony and Coordination - The Conference Achieved a Complete Success; Utmost Sincerity and Frankness - Political Disputes Will Be Thoroughly Eliminated

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 31st] Chairman Chiang, on the 31st, delivered a speech at the closing of the Political Consultative Conference. The full text is as follows:

Esteemed Members, Since the opening of the Political Consultative Conference, after more than twenty days of passionate discussions, it has completed its due tasks. Today, it is declared closed. I, in my official capacity, have been unable to personally attend every meeting to exchange opinions with you all, for which I feel deeply apologetic. Looking back on these twenty-odd days, whether in group discussions or plenary sessions, all members have been able to be open and frank, adhering to the spirit of mutual respect, mutual trust, mutual assistance, and cooperation, seeking reasonable solutions to various problems based on a pragmatic approach. This has allowed the conference to consistently maintain an atmosphere of harmony and coordination, achieving complete success, which is the most valuable outcome of this conference. I sincerely hope that this spirit of public duty and frankness can be maintained forever. If everyone avoids contention and does not prioritize personal opinions, but wholeheartedly works together for the country and its people, then all the decisions of this conference will be smoothly implemented. In the future, pointless political disputes will be thoroughly eliminated, the goal of peaceful nation-building will be quickly achieved, and the prospects for the future implementation of constitutional government will therefore become even brighter. This is my extremely joyful feeling at the close of the conference today, and I must express my gratitude to all of you.

The Only Important Issue Currently: Ensuring Unification and Establishing Democracy

Originally, the purpose of our National Revolution was to complete the construction of the Three Principles of the People and create an independent, free, unified, and democratic country, especially to unite and strive to achieve the goal of peaceful nation-building. As for the targets of the National Revolution, externally, it was to eliminate imperialist aggression; internally, it was to overthrow feudal separatism. In the past, overthrowing the Manchu Qing, eliminating warlords, and in the eight years of the War of Resistance against Japan, working diligently and struggling arduously, the sole purpose was to seek independence and unification, first removing obstacles to democracy in order to complete the realization of a democratic system. Now, the work of removing revolutionary obstacles and laying the foundation for democracy has been initially successful. The only important issue we face currently is how to ensure unification and how to establish democracy. In other words, it is how to realize the Three Principles of the People. We must understand that only with genuine unification can there be genuine democracy. I believe that from now on, there will be no privately owned armed forces or separate local regimes within our country to hinder the unification of political and military orders. Otherwise, no matter how loudly we proclaim democracy, what is actually manifested will be a false democracy where everyone acts in their own way, or even completely anti-democratic actions. Such a false democracy can never embark on the path of democratic constitutionalism, and will forever be an obstacle to democratic politics. Therefore, in order to realize genuine democracy and genuine unification, the two conditions of peace and unity are indeed our most urgent needs.

Unification, Democracy, Peace, and Unity: The Four Major Principles Are Held As Creeds

Because of the Founding Father's deathbed testament, "Strive for peace to save China," I personally and the comrades of the Chinese Nationalist Party have always adhered to this lofty instruction. Except for using force to resist separatist warlords and aggressive Japan, for all other domestic issues, no matter what serious situation we encountered, we always held firm to the determination to endure for the sake of the country, not hesitating to compromise and seek political solutions. Even if military conflicts were unavoidable, they were only passive defense, and we never took proactive actions. This is because we believe that our national strength and the people's strength can only be maintained and nurtured in stability, and cannot withstand any further devastation of war. Therefore, we have been able to transform discord into harmony in every moment of crisis, and even conflicting opinions have been able to converge and return to peace and unity. These past experiences, especially the facts of the eight years since the War of Resistance, are well known to the people of the country and need no further elaboration. This is the spirit of unification, democracy, peace, and unity that we advocate today. And this Political Consultative Conference was conducted based on the four major principles of unification, democracy, peace, and unity, so all proposals have credible and feasible decisions. I want to frankly say that this is indeed the victorious result of the cultivation and nurturing of the spirit of the National Revolution over the past fifty years in China, which can bring boundless comfort to the countrymen who have endured suffering and urgently need recuperation. I hope that we all hold these four major principles as our creeds forever, and always abide by and work together towards these creeds, so that we can comfort the revolutionary martyrs who sacrificed for the War of Resistance and not betray the expectations of the people of the country.

Sincere Consultations on Decisions on Various Cases: The Government Should Implement Them Separately

On the day the conference opened, the government issued an order to cease military conflicts nationwide and restore transportation. Government representatives and representatives of the Communist Party of China also announced the measures agreed upon on January 5th, and at the same time announced all of the order's content and its four attached regulations, to demonstrate the determination to comply consistently. On the second day of the conference, government representatives and representatives of the Communist Party of China reported in detail to the conference, so that the conference could concentrate on studying various plans for peaceful nation-building and promoting constitutionalism. Although I have not been able to attend and participate in every session of the conference, I have been paying attention to and studying at all times, and I feel that the content of each plan is the crystallization of everyone's sincere consultations. I dare to state on behalf of the government that the government will definitely respect them, and will implement them separately according to the plans after completing the prescribed procedures. I believe that among all the proposals, the Program for Peaceful Nation-Building is the basic core of various plans, because the various provisions of the nine chapters of this plan, from General Principles (甲), People's Rights (乙), Politics (丙), Military Affairs (丁), Diplomacy (戊), Economy and Finance (己), Education and Culture (庚), Post-War Relief (辛), and Overseas Chinese Affairs (壬), are all unusually complete, truly meet the requirements of the times, are full of unity, and are full of democracy. It is truly the most suitable program for transitioning to the constitutional period. With this program, governments from the central to all local areas in the country, all parties, factions, and social leaders, and all compatriots across the country have a common standard to follow. In particular, all the parties and factions participating in this conference have jointly discussed and agreed upon this program and will participate in the government to jointly implement it. We must be trustworthy and responsible to the people of the country, starting with our own practical actions, and must implement its national character so that it can be universally realized.

Political Parties Should Organize Openly and Should No Longer Use Armed Uprisings

I believe there are two things that we must pay special attention to and solemnly declare: First, since this program stipulates that "ensuring that people already enjoy freedom of body, thought, religion, belief, speech, publication, assembly, association, residence, movement, and communication," all current wartime laws that conflict with this principle will, of course, be revised or abolished by the central government. At the same time, I believe that within the areas where the Communist Party of China's troops are stationed, they will certainly comply with this program, lifting all existing restrictions. As for education and culture, it is also stipulated that "academic freedom is guaranteed, and school administration shall not be interfered with by religion or political thought," which is very important for the development of our country's education and culture and for creating a good environment for young people. In the future, for their own protection, only laws that comply with this program should be enforced throughout the country, and there should no longer be any differences or special measures. Then, in the future, the activities of various political parties, even their competition for political power, can be organized and conducted openly in accordance with the legitimate rights and procedures that national unified laws should have, and there should no longer be any acts of using armed uprisings or secret organizations in various places. Otherwise, it would be losing the essence of a political party, destroying the spirit of democracy, violating this program, and hindering the process of constitutional government. If we are to be worthy of being political parties in a democratic country, we must eradicate all the past bad phenomena of all political parties since the founding of the Republic and only then will we have the hope of building a modern country.

The Implementation of Military Reorganization Must Be Thorough, and Military and Political Personnel Must Strictly Comply

Second, Chapter Ding (Military Affairs) of this program is extremely practical in its purpose and regulations regarding the nationalization of the military. In addition, there is a more detailed military plan that has been negotiated through the military group. I think that since we urgently need peace and unification, the military part of the program is the greatest element in consolidating peace and completing unification. The government has already made decisions on the issue of military reorganization and is implementing them. The Vice Minister of the Ministry of Military Affairs has also reported in detail to this conference, and will continue to promote it in accordance with the provisions of the program and plan in the future. As for the reorganization of the Communist Party of China's troops, it will naturally also be thoroughly reorganized in accordance with the program and plan. Originally, the unification of military administration and military orders is a necessary basic condition for establishing a country. This is not only the unanimous demand of compatriots throughout the country who have suffered greatly, but also the principle repeatedly declared by all parties, which is considered undeniable. Now that the Consultative Conference has results and the main points have been agreed upon, our most urgent task at present is to ensure that all military forces across the country, regardless of party affiliation or region, can obey the government's command, so as to achieve the standard of unifying military orders, military administration, and the military system as stipulated in the program. I dare to firmly believe that this is something that everyone agrees with, and there will be no exceptions. Only by truly achieving this can we meet the requirements of nation-building and comfort the people's aspirations. Otherwise, not only is there no meaning for everyone to participate in the government, but peace and unity will also have no foundation, and instead increase the crisis of the country and the entanglement within the government. This is certainly not what the country and the people need, nor is it the sincere intention of all members and all political parties to plan for the country. The two points mentioned above are indeed the key to whether this program can be fully implemented. If they can be thoroughly achieved, the order of the country will immediately stabilize, the work of rehabilitation can be smoothly completed, and the other chapters and articles of this program can also be easily solved and fully implemented. This is the undeniable responsibility of the colleagues of this conference. Today, with the most sincere sincerity, I especially draw everyone's attention, and at the same time, I personally vow to faithfully abide by this program, and I must supervise our military and political personnel at all levels to strictly comply with it. Even if unintentional mistakes or inadequate supervision are unavoidable at times, as long as everyone explains and points them out, neither I myself nor my subordinates will fail to sincerely accept and earnestly correct them. I often say, "To demand freedom, one must first understand the nature of freedom. One must not only care about one's own freedom and infringe on the freedom of others. To advocate democracy, one must first cultivate the habit of the rule of law. One must not only expect others to abide by the law, but oneself must place oneself outside the law everywhere." These few words of mine are truly based on the vague understanding of freedom and democracy and the weak awareness of the rule of law in our country's society. Without social stability, there is no foundation for the country. If the people do not value the rule of law, all kinds of evils will inevitably be carried out in the name of democracy and freedom. Therefore, my words above are indeed a heartfelt appeal. Especially in recent years, the morbid state manifested in society and the educational field is even more profound and significant. If this is not improved for a long time, our China will not be able to stand on its own among modern nations. Members must also have the same feeling. Now our Political Consultative Conference has agreed on the Program for Peaceful Nation-Building. This program is dedicated to protecting democratic freedom and aims to establish a peaceful, unified country under the rule of law. In order to exert the practical effect of this conference and create a scale for nation-building, we must first take on the responsibility of changing the atmosphere ourselves, establish the spirit of abiding by the law, and serve as a model for the people of the country. Only then can we fulfill our mission to history and the times.

The Great Cause of Nation-Building Begins Today: Together We Bear a Great Responsibility for the Future of the Nation

Finally, I want to take advantage of the opportunity today, when the conference has been completed and everyone has gathered together, to simply state to you what I have accumulated in my heart for many years but have not said. Personally, Zhongzheng has not been interested in politics since childhood. My lifelong ambition and career have been to dedicate myself to the National Revolution in order to save the country and its people. From the Xinhai Revolution to the present victory of the War of Resistance, I have participated in all the revolutionary battles in these thirty-five years. I have experienced all kinds of difficulties and hardships, and I have not failed to fulfill my revolutionary aspirations and the revolutionary obligations that I should have fulfilled. I can comfort myself that I have done my part for the country and the people. Today, although I cannot say that the National Revolution has been completely successful, the work of removing revolutionary obstacles has indeed come to an end. From now on, the country will completely enter the period when the great cause of nation-building begins. However, after our country's vitality has been depleted, the dangers to the country's future and the difficulties of the cause of nation-building are only more serious than before the war or even during the war. I am really filled with trepidation. Fortunately, this Political Consultative Conference has formulated the Program for Peaceful Nation-Building and various related plans. The initial foundation for nation-building has been laid, and the implementation of constitutional government is in sight. In the future, the core members of all parties and factions, as well as social elites, will participate in the government and jointly shoulder the great responsibility for the future of the country and the nation. In the future, the burden of nation-building will not be the responsibility of the Nationalist Party alone, let alone the responsibility of Zhongzheng personally. This major responsibility will be entrusted to all colleagues and compatriots across the country to jointly bear. In the future, whether Zhongzheng is in or out of office, I will abide by all the resolutions of this conference faithfully and firmly in accordance with the responsibilities that a citizen should fulfill, and ensure the consistent sincerity of peace and unity, urging our country to embark on the bright path of unified democracy, in order to repay the revolutionary martyrs who sacrificed for the War of Resistance and to complete the unfinished achievements of the Founding Father in creating the Republic. At the same time, I ask all colleagues to work together for the country and the people, taking the spirit of sharing weal and woe during the War of Resistance, with one heart and one mind, and uniting sincerely, to shoulder the heavy responsibility of nation-building in the future. Open up a bright and brilliant future for our country and nation! (End)

[United Press, London, 31st] Since the Security Council resolved to remove the Iranian-Soviet issue from the agenda and have the countries concerned negotiate directly, representatives of various countries have praised this, believing that this is the initial achievement of the Security Council and a good omen for the smooth development of the Council. Some parties had expressed pessimism, believing that the United Nations organization was just a successor to the League of Nations, but since the publication of the above resolution, this view has been dispelled. This resolution is called a "half compromise" because the United Nations organization retains the right to intervene in negotiations at any time, while also preserving the "face" of the relevant parties, namely the Soviet Union, Iran, Britain, and the United Nations organization.

### Gu Weijun's Speech at the Security Council the Day Before Yesterday: Advocated Prudent Handling of the Iranian-Soviet Issue

[Central News Agency Reporter Xu Zhaoyong, London, 30th Dispatch] During the Security Council meeting of the United Nations this afternoon, the Acting Chief Representative of China, Mr. Gu Weijun, expressed the opinion of our delegation on the Iranian issue. Mr. Gu urged the Council to handle this matter with extreme caution, as this is the first issue submitted to the Council within the scope of Chapter VI of the Charter, and is related to the resolution of disputes in the Pacific region. Mr. Gu stated that both the Soviet Union and Iran have expressed their willingness to continue to adopt bilateral negotiations to seek a solution. Based on the clear wishes of both parties, the Council should support this approach. The Chinese delegation deeply hopes that the Soviet Union and Iran will reach an agreement through negotiations. The Chinese delegation believes that Iran's request for the Council to put forward suggestions for negotiation is unnecessary, because such measures are only justified when one of the two parties indicates disagreement with the negotiation process. If so, the Council may discuss the issue of putting forward suggestions. Mr. Gu concluded by saying that he was deeply impressed by the sincerity of the Soviet representative's efforts to promote negotiations, and agreed with the suggestion made by the U.S. representative that the Council should be notified of the situation and results of the bilateral negotiations. French Representative Bidault agreed with Mr. Gu's opinion, saying that the Council should reserve the right to consider this matter at any time in case the negotiations fail, while also paying attention to the wishes of both parties to conduct negotiations, and allowing the Soviet Union and Iran to negotiate freely.

### The United Nations Prepares to Take Over the Assets of the Old League of Nations

### Chinese, English, French, Soviet, and Spanish: Five Languages as Official Languages of the United Nations

[Central News Agency, London, 28th Dispatch] The issue of the official languages of the United Nations previously caused considerable debate in the Preparatory Committee. This morning, the Political Security Subcommittee of the United Nations General Assembly finally reached a resolution. Although the meeting this morning lasted less than an hour, the recommendation of the subsidiary committee was unanimously passed with 39 votes (with representatives from 12 other countries absent). The recommendation stipulates that the language rules of the San Francisco Conference, namely Chinese, English, French, Soviet, and Spanish, shall be used as the official languages, and English and French shall be the two working languages. The rules on official and working languages passed at this morning's meeting will apply not only to the General Assembly, but also to any organization of the United Nations, with the exception of the International Court of Justice, which uses English and French as its official languages. These language rules also stipulate that English and French shall be the working languages. All speeches delivered in Chinese and Spanish shall be translated into the working languages. Any representative may speak in languages other than these five official languages, but must be translated into one of the two working languages. The written records of the meeting shall be issued in the working languages, but if any representative requests it, there shall be a translation of the entire or partial record. The summary of the record shall be issued in the five official languages. All resolutions and important documents shall have copies in the five official languages.

### British Envoy Lord Killearn Discusses the East Indian Issue: Transfer to United Nations Trusteeship Possible

[United Press, Singapore, 31st Dispatch] British envoy Lord Killearn is currently passing through here on his way to Java to participate in negotiations between the Republic of East India and the Dutch government. According to reports, it is highly likely that East India will be placed under the trusteeship of a United Nations organization. However, the issue of East Indian trusteeship should be decided by the Dutch government and has no connection with the British government until the matter is raised to the United Nations.

[United Press, Batavia, 31st Dispatch] Indonesian weaver Xinjiang Shali told our office yesterday that compromise is impossible under the principle of self-determination.

### British Empire Forces to Occupy Japan: Advance Party Lands in Southern Kyushu

[Reuters, London, January 31st] Officials here today announced details of the British Empire's participation in the occupation of Japan. The British Empire forces are selected from the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and India, and are commanded by Australian Lieutenant General Northcott. Preparations for his occupation mission are actively underway. Representatives from the British Commonwealth countries will participate in Lieutenant General Northcott's headquarters. His Chief of Staff is Australian Royal Air Force General Whiteley. A British, Australian, and Indian naval squadron of the British Pacific Fleet is currently stationed in Japanese territorial waters. A British-Indian division, led by Major General Cowan, includes the 5th Brigade of the British 2nd Division. The Australian contingent includes the 34th Australian Infantry Brigade, led by Brigadier Nielson. The New Zealand contingent, one brigade, is commanded by Brigadier Stewart. Air Vice-Marshal Bouchier commands the air force units.

This advance party will prepare the ground for the successive landings of Australian, New Zealand, and Indian troops.

### Remains of Japanese Killed by Atomic Bomb to be Used for Medical Dissection

[Associated Press, Washington, January 30th] According to sources within the Military Affairs Committee: the committee brought back from Hiroshima hundreds of remains of Japanese people killed by the atomic bomb, ranging in age from young to old. Some were instantly vaporized by the blast, others died from severe injuries. Military scientists here are already dissecting them to learn more about the effects of atomic energy on the human body and to study whether there are effective treatments for such injuries. In addition, the committee also brought back hundreds of blood samples from survivors who were injured but not killed, as well as other medical records. Detailed records were also kept on 16,000 people who were within the bombed area, or in the immediate vicinity, who were either unharmed or recovered from their injuries. According to Colonel Ash, director of the Army Pathology Institute, "What we want to know is, what effect does the radiation released by the atomic bomb have on human cells and tissues? Perhaps it has a very significant impact on human tissue, especially bone marrow. But perhaps the radiation is completely different from other types of energy we currently know, and its impact on the human body is also completely different."

### Severe Rice Shortage in Vietnam

[Central News Agency, Hanoi, January 30th Special Dispatch] The rice shortage in Northern Vietnam has reached a critical stage. It is generally expected that without immediate and active remedies, a large number of people will die of starvation. According to a 1936 French survey, the population of the Tonkin region was approximately eight million. The annual rice production from 2.3 million mu of cultivated land was barely enough to feed the population. However, over the past four years, the Japanese forced farmers to switch to growing ramie, reducing the area of rice paddies. The severe cold in the spring of 1945 greatly affected the winter harvest and spring planting, leading to an unprecedented famine. According to Vietnamese statistics, two million people died of starvation at that time, while the French claimed the death toll was 800,000. Unfortunately, last summer's continuous rain caused widespread flooding in the low-lying areas of Northern Vietnam, inundating one-third of the cultivated land. Before the floodwaters receded, drought followed, drastically reducing the harvest. According to statistics from the non-governmental Vietnamese Disaster Relief Association, Northern Vietnam will be short 850,000 tons of grain in the next three months. Although the Vietnamese government has ordered food rationing and grain transfers to provide relief, it will be impossible to remedy the impending severe food shortage.

### China's Eight Years of War of Resistance: Greatest Contribution, US Lend-Lease Aid to China: Approximately $600 Million

[United States Information Service, Washington, January 31st] President Truman today submitted his twenty-first report on Lend-Lease activities to Congress. The report covers the period up to September 30, 1945, regarding the war against Japan. The main points are as follows: Transporting Lend-Lease goods for the war against Japan was secondary to the needs of the war against Germany. This flow of goods from the United States began in May 1941. From that period until the Pearl Harbor attack, exports totaled $40 million. By the time of Japan's surrender, the export of Lend-Lease munitions and other war supplies had reached $3.8 billion. These goods were a major factor in bringing about Japan's surrender. In addition, we also shipped supplies worth $167 million to American officers in various war zones and transferred them to allied countries in accordance with the provisions of the Lend-Lease program. We sent 8,800 Lend-Lease aircraft to the Asian and Pacific war zones, including 850 four-engine bombers, 1,452 two-engine and one-engine bombers, 2,800 fighters, 1,360 transport aircraft, and the remaining number were training aircraft. The transport aircraft were used to transport supplies from one base to another, and also to China. Under the Lend-Lease program, we shipped 3,200 tanks, most of which were shipped to India. We also shipped 21 American-made trucks to the allied countries fighting against Japan.

From the beginning of the program to October 1, 1945, Lend-Lease goods shipped to China were worth approximately $224.4 million. But in fact, American Lend-Lease aid to China has exceeded the value of the above exports. We authorized American military commanders in various regions to transfer Lend-Lease goods to China. The Lend-Lease goods in this area were worth $167 million. This figure is not included in the export figures mentioned above. We also provided China with assistance in various other ways, such as training aircraft and equipment for training pilots in the United States. At the same time, the supplies of the American troops in China transferred to the Chinese army were also included in the Lend-Lease aid. However, we have not yet fully received the latest reports as of now. The Chinese army's most needed munitions and transportation equipment, and most of the above types have been included to meet their needs. We also supplied China with limited but extremely important precision machine tool parts and rare metals to help them increase their own munitions production. According to the Lend-Lease program, we can also supply China with technical personnel to serve in supervisory and technical positions. We sent more than a thousand American technicians to the Far East to train Chinese personnel to repair and use transportation vehicles.

During the war against Japan, China supplied the American army with its limited resources, and tens of millions of Chinese people helped the American air force build airfields, the Ledo Road, and other facilities with extensive uses. The greatest contribution of China to the common war effort was its eight years of resolute resistance against Japan. This heroic struggle of hundreds of millions of people against aggression has paled in comparison with the material contributions estimated in money.

### China is Planning to Implement a Preliminary Post-War Reconstruction Plan, Intends to Purchase a Large Number of Goods from the United States, According to a Representative of the Sino-American Industrial and Commercial Association

[Central News Agency, New York, January 30th, United Press] Ms. Smith, Washington representative of the Sino-American Industrial and Commercial Association, said that China is now planning to implement a preliminary post-war reconstruction plan, which will spend 2 billion yuan in three years, and China will purchase a large number of goods from the United States. Smith made the remarks at a gathering of 100 members of the Export Advertising Association. She said that the government's large-scale purchases and the inevitable large-scale purchases of goods by private individuals after the war will make China an ideal place for advertisers. China has used modern advertising techniques in the past 20 years, and American advertisers will be able to learn about this medium. In order to facilitate China's promotion of goods, advertisers not only have a great opportunity to introduce American technological developments to China, but also China's specialized publications, newspapers and magazines have increased day by day in recent years, and at the same time, they can also enable the United States to gain an understanding of modern China. The China that the United States could recognize in the past was a poor and hard-working country. Chinese intellectuals are committed to transforming the social state and establishing China as a modernized country. They all know the low living standards of the domestic masses, but they also raise reasonable inquiries, that is, why do Americans often expose this conspiracy, but do not introduce the construction work that has been completed and is in progress. The main force for building a new China will be professional and technical talents. They have completed amazing achievements due to wartime needs, but this may not be achieved in 50 years in peacetime. After the abolition of extraterritoriality, the Chinese market will increase accordingly, and the sales area will also be re-evaluated. Because American businessmen will be able to do business in any region of China for the first time in the future. She predicts that China's stable monetary system can get a "reasonable opportunity", and if trade barriers are eliminated by international trade organizations and other media, China can obtain a basis for working to stabilize the monetary system. Ms. Smith has worked for the State Department in China for 20 years.

### British Executioner Retires After 35 Years of Service

[Reuters, London, January 31st] Pierrepont, the 75-year-old No. 1 British executioner, has recently retired after 35 years of service. The death sentences of the eleven main offenders in the Belsen concentration camp were all carried out by him. The executions lasted from 9:10 a.m. to 4:16 p.m. that day. Pierrepont's successor is his assistant, Albert Pierrepont. Albert Pierrepont, 37, is the manager of a warehouse in Yorkshire. He has been his uncle's assistant for many years. He hanged John Amery and Lord Haw-Haw. He received ten pounds per execution. Pierrepont's predecessor was Ellis, who was an expert in hanging. Before the execution, he observed the prisoner through a small hole in the prison and could predict in advance how long it would take to kill them.

### US President's Message to Congress: Urges Approval of Loan to Britain, Says It Will Help Expand World Trade

[Reuters, Washington, January 30th] President Truman yesterday sent a message to Congress, asking for approval of a loan of $3.75 billion to Britain. It stated, "Britain needs this line of credit, and needs it now. It is not an exaggeration to say that this agreement will chart the course of US-British economic relations for many years to come. Moreover, this action will have a decisive impact on the entire world's international trade, and can help Britain cope with its payment deficit in the next six years, collecting food and raw material supplies from the world, which is essential for the lives of the British people. At the same time, the United States can also maintain the openness of its market for exporting surplus goods to the United Kingdom. All of these are the short-term important goals of the line of credit. In terms of the United States, the most important benefits of the loan can be obtained in its long-term goals. Because the agreement enables the United Kingdom to immediately implement exchange restrictions, and to advance shoulder-to-shoulder with the United States towards the common goal of expanding world trade, thus production, consumption and employment can be expanded, and living standards everywhere can be improved. Regarding the agreement stipulating that Britain can be exempted from paying interest in any year if it finds that it does not have enough cash to pay interest, President Du urged everyone to pay attention, saying: "If they are forced to pay interest even if they cannot pay, which will damage international economic relations, it is not in our interests. In addition to the direct benefits gained from promoting Anglo-American trade, the United Kingdom's leading relaxation of its restrictions will also benefit from the subsequent relaxation by its family. The financial agreement will also enable the United Kingdom to fully support the various trade and employment proposals recently put forward by the United States as a basis for international discussions by the United Nations. The implementation of the agreement will make a significant contribution to establishing lasting peace and prosperity. Furthermore, it will prevent economic disputes from arising between the two countries, and the provisions of the Bretton Woods Agreement will be implemented more quickly and fully than Congress believed possible when it formulated the agreement."

Public Debate Will Take Time

[Reuters, Washington, January 30th] Judging from today's situation, the chances of quick approval are diminishing. The President's message, together with the full text of the loan agreement, will first be submitted to the committees of both houses of Congress for consideration, and then submitted to the Senate and House of Representatives for public debate. The Republican and Democratic leaders of the House Banking and Trade Committee both estimate that even without a long-term public debate, their hearings will take at least four weeks. It is generally believed that the approval of this agreement is the most controversial diplomatic policy tool in recent years. Senator Brewster (Democrat) firmly believes that the agreement is the "cornerstone of international cooperation," but few members of Congress show signs of accepting this view. Senator Hurlbutt, the Republican leader of the Senate Banking Committee, said that the economic disputes concerning the loan are difficult to reconcile with political disputes, which can be seen from the current situation. Majority Leader Barkley (Democrat) formally declared that the loan to Britain has forced the Senate to choose between a war on the economy or an opportunity to increase exports of American industrial and agricultural products. The United Kingdom is America's best customer. Senator Lyons said that three-quarters of the people who elected him support the loan, and those who oppose it have no chance of winning.

### Italy Hopes to Retain Colonies

[Reuters, Rome, January 31st] The Italian people hope to recover their colonies according to the provisions of the Atlantic Charter, which states: "The United States and the United Kingdom do not desire to see any territorial changes that do not accord with the freely expressed wishes of the peoples concerned." Although the Italian people know that Italy has a bill to pay, they feel that the division of Italian colonies by the great powers cannot be used as payment for the bill. Eritrea, Somaliland, Libya and other Italian African colonies have a very close relationship with Italy. In the first 50 years of Italy's development of these colonies, there was no profit at all. It was not until recently that the construction projects began to take shape. Once they have to be handed over to others, the Italian people are unwilling. Moreover, Italy's acquisition of these colonies was with the consent and encouragement of the leaders of European countries at that time. Because there were too many people and too little land in Italy, European countries recognized that Italy had the need to immigrate abroad. If Italy's colonies are deprived, the population of Italy will become crowded again, which is contrary to the intention of maintaining lasting peace.

### Commander of the Pacific Fleet Spruance to Take Office Today

### Islamic League Opposes Partition of India, to Hold Meeting in London

[Reuters, London, January 31st] The secretary of the London Islamic League issued a statement last night stating that the League will hold a public meeting on Sunday to protest Britain's attitude towards the partition of India. The agenda includes three items: First, requiring the British government to consider setting up two constituent assemblies, one to draft the constitution of India and the other to draft the constitution of the partition of India. The second is to require the British government to abandon its temporary solution to the Indian constitutional assembly and make a final decision on public governance in India. Third, the Indonesian war may end as soon as possible.

### Flying Car Successfully Tested

[Associated Press, Dallas, Texas, January 31st] A new type of "flying car" manufactured by Southern Motors was tested at a nearby airport here today and was quite successful. The car is no different from an airplane when flying, but after removing the wings, tail, and various parts, it can be driven on flat ground and parked in a regular car shed. The removal procedure only takes five minutes. The car can accommodate two people and is equipped with a 125-horsepower engine, one front wheel, and two rear wheels. The maximum speed is 128 miles per hour. But this type of car is not yet on the market.

### Mountbatten Flies to Hong Kong

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, January 31st, Reuters] Official sources said that Lord Mountbatten will fly here from Singapore on February 1 to discuss the administrative issues of British overseas colonies with the authorities here.

### International Snippets

The British House of Commons passed the second reading of the Mining Nationalization Bill on January 31, which is another step in the government's five-year plan.

The Yugoslav Parliament passed a new draft constitution on January 31, stipulating the establishment of the Yugoslav Republic. The parliament will also promulgate a constitution, granting the parliament legal powers.

Four Germans, including three generals, were convicted of expelling two million Soviet people and prisoners of war, and were hanged in Minsk after a military court trial.

General Mitchell, a famous American Air Force general in World War I, suggested to the Army and Navy authorities that they use atomic bombs to detect gold and other mineral deposits in Antarctica, because atomic bombs are enough to break up icebergs and open the door to the Antarctic continent.

### Mountbatten: Still as a Virgin, Swift as a Rabbit – The Southeast Asian Situation Turns Around

—A Telegram from London, December 22nd, by Xue Yan

Seen from Britain, the post-war problems in Europe and the Far Eastern Theater are completely different, and Britain's role is also quite different. Europe, after this catastrophe, is scarred and its people are destitute. The most urgent need is relief. Moreover, various small countries are plagued by left-right struggles. Britain's hope is only that its influence will not be completely ignored in these disputes between the left and right factions. Everyone knows that Britain's traditional policy towards the European continent is to adopt an observer's attitude, not to get involved in its internal entanglements. What Britain cares most about is that no overwhelming power should emerge on the continent, so it often supports the second strongest to resist the strongest power, maintaining a balance of power so that Britain's own strength can be concentrated on the development of the empire. Whether Britain will still adopt this traditional policy towards Europe after this war, we do not know, but at least Britain has not explicitly stated that it will abandon this traditional policy. Some say that Britain's current strong support for France is a manifestation of this new balance of power policy, which may be correct. Therefore, Britain's policy towards Europe is how to relieve the people's livelihood, restore stability, and maintain a balance of power, which can be said to be more focused on the passive aspects. Post-war problems are therefore post-war reconstruction problems.

But the situation in the Far Eastern Theater is very different. In the Far Eastern Theater, the one most closely related to Britain is the Southeast Asian Theater. This is an area rich in materials and with a low level of public knowledge. There are many natural resources that have not yet been developed. In terms of wealth, it is a treasure trove with infinite potential, and therefore it is a great treasure trove with unlimited prospects. In today's British Empire, which has many disputes and opportunities for development, a new world may be unfolded. Therefore, Britain's handling of the post-war problems in this theater is more proactive and places unlimited hope on it.

Southeast Asia is just a collective geographical term without a fixed boundary. Any area within the command authority of the Supreme Allied Commander of Southeast Asia is Southeast Asia. After Japan surrendered, it was stipulated that Siam and southern Vietnam would also be accepted by the Supreme Allied Commander of Southeast Asia, so these two places are also considered to be within the scope of Southeast Asia. The two most famous sentences in ancient Chinese military books praising generals' strategies are "Still as a virgin, swift as a rabbit." General Mountbatten, the Supreme Commander of Southeast Asia, is most worthy of these two comments. Since the establishment of the Supreme Allied Headquarters of Southeast Asia, he has been sitting in Ceylon for two years, and his command has been decisive, which can be said to be as still as a virgin. When the Japanese surrendered, he immediately took action. In a few months, not only have Burma, Malaya, Singapore, and other places been completely recovered, but also in Siam, southern Vietnam, and the Dutch and British-owned South Pacific Islands, he has made deployments and achieved remarkable results. Today, the vast territory of Southeast Asia is all in the process of being disposed of by him.

Britain Assists in Restoring Order in Vietnamese Territory Formerly Governed by the Han Dynasty

If we pay attention to today's Southeast Asia, we know that military problems, except for the Dutch East Indies, have mostly passed. Even the military situation in the Dutch East Indies is no longer a matter of disarming the Japanese army, but a matter of conflict between the British army, the Dutch army, and the local revolutionary army. But the political problems are relatively complex, and because the historical backgrounds of various places are different, the ways of dealing with them are naturally also different. Among them, the former British colonies, such as Burma, Malaya, and British-owned South Pacific Islands, are mainly about restoring the original state and returning to the scope of the British Empire. The most urgent thing at present is price control and commodity supply, which need to be solved immediately, but this is an almost universal phenomenon in the world at present, which is not surprising. Secondly, in southern French Vietnam, Britain's policy is also very clear, mainly to disarm the Japanese army and restore order, and in order to restore order, it also strives to subdue the local people's resistance to France. Now this task has come to an end, and it can be handed over to France as it was before. Vietnam had received many promises from France during the Japanese occupation, but how these promises will be fulfilled is a matter for France in the future. Britain did not say that it should be listed as one of the conditions for handover. This is clearly different from the Dutch East Indies problem we will discuss later. Among the post-war problems in Southeast Asia today, the most subtle are the problems of Siam and the Dutch East Indies, but both places have recently had new results.

After Compromising with the United States, Britain and Siam Signed a Peace Agreement

Siam was considered an independent country before the war. Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, it has been the only country that cooperated with Japan in doing evil in the Far East. It had used troops against China on the southern border of Lingnan, oppressed overseas Chinese before the war, and was the only country in the world that committed the most heinous crimes against overseas Chinese during the war and refused to repent after Japan surrendered, continuing to massacre overseas Chinese. This time, following Japan's surrender, the Supreme Allied Headquarters of Southeast Asia sent troops to garrison and disarm the Japanese army in its territory and punish Siam. We not only agree with this, but also pay close attention to it. We have long heard that Siam has sent representatives to Singapore to discuss a peace agreement with representatives of General Mountbatten. However, London newspapers publish very little about the content of the peace agreement. As for the reason for the scarcity, we speculate that it is not that the British people do not pay attention, but that the British people trust General Mountbatten very much and feel that the products that pass through Mountbatten's hands will not be detrimental to Britain. There is no need to consult carefully. Sometimes not consulting and letting him proceed quietly may be more beneficial to Britain. It was not until December 19 that the US State Department suddenly released news that the peace agreement currently being negotiated between Britain and Siam would result in Siam becoming a British dependency. At the same time, the US Chargé d'Affaires in London officially went to the British Foreign Office to inquire and explain the US's views. Since then, British newspapers have gradually revealed the content of the agreement and explained on behalf of the government, saying that the conditions are not too harsh. It is said that the only harsher condition is that Siam should compensate 1.5 million tons of rice, but considering Siam's predictable bumper harvest this year, it is not too excessive and will not hinder Siam's own food supply. Later, newspapers vaguely mentioned that the British government was explaining to the United States, and some newspapers predicted that the signing of the agreement would be postponed. It was not until December 22 that the US State Department announced the withdrawal of its proposal, saying that although the US's suggestions were not fully accepted by the British side, most of them had been accepted, so the US's request for a postponement of the signing was automatically withdrawn. As a result, the peace agreement between Britain and Siam was signed in Singapore on New Year's Day this year. Due to the above process, we can believe that the agreement signed now is the result of a compromise between Britain and the United States. As for the original conditions, we do not know them because they have never been fully disclosed. We also do not know what the US's suggestions were and what parts were accepted by Britain.

Nine Key Points of the Agreement Include a Ban on the Export of Siamese Rice

The key points of the agreement have been published in the London newspapers of the 2nd, which are roughly as follows: (1) All British-owned territories occupied by Siam after December 7, 1941, shall be completely returned. (2) The Siamese government shall return all public and private rights and property losses suffered by Britain in Siam during the war and compensate for the losses. (3) Siam shall fully cooperate with the international security measures stipulated in the United Nations organization. The canal of the Kra Isthmus shall not be excavated without the consent of Britain. (4) Siam and Britain and the British-owned territories near Siam shall resume import and export trade and coastal shipping as soon as possible and re-sign trade and shipping treaties. (5) Before September 1, 1947, Siam shall prohibit the export of rice, tin, rubber, and teak, and provide 1.5 million tons of rice free of charge for food in nearby British-owned territories, unless introduced by the Combined Board in Washington. (6) Siam shall participate in general international measures regarding the handling of tin and rubber as soon as possible by negotiating a trade and shipping treaty with India. (7) Restore the rights and interests of British merchants and civil aviation in Siam, at a minimum, restore the rights enjoyed by Imperial Airways before December 7, 1941. (8) Restore all international treaties or agreements that Siam and Britain or India participated in before December 7, 1941. Siam must also fulfill its obligations under the international treaties that Britain or India participated in (but Siam did not participate in) before December 7, 1941. Siam shall also comply with and fulfill its responsibilities and obligations arising under the international organizations established after December 7, 1941. (9) In view of the above conditions, Britain immediately recognizes that the state of belligerency of Siam has ended, restores normal international relations, exchanges diplomatic envoys, and Britain and India support Siam's participation in the United Nations organization. One party to this agreement is the representative of Britain and India, and the other party is the representative of Siam.

Britain and India Have Been Compensated, China Should Also Make Demands

Because the British newspapers did not disclose the original text of the agreement, we have no way to speculate whether this is the entire treaty. If it is, then the US's statement that Siam will become a British territory is an exaggeration. Or it is different from the original draft, which is the result of Britain accepting the US's suggestions. Judging from the above clauses alone, the first thing we notice is that there is no mention of troop withdrawal. Secondly, although this is an agreement signed between Britain and India and Siam, Siam's important products have been restricted and cannot be freely exported. Because the Combined Board in Washington is actually only an organization of Britain and the United States, other countries have no way to intervene even if they re-sign a treaty with Siam. As for the export of rice, it is most noteworthy that China may also need to import Siamese rice to relieve disaster areas in the next two years, and it is now restricted. In this war, China and overseas Chinese suffered the most harm from Siam. Britain and India have now been compensated, and China should also demand compensation. In addition, after the establishment of the agreement between Britain and India and Siam, the impact on the commerce and economy within Siam is profound, and most of the overseas Chinese in Siam are in the economic and commercial circles. At a minimum, we should immediately take steps to prevent the Siamese government from shifting this responsibility to our overseas Chinese.

Britain Strengthens Control and Maintains Neutrality Towards East India

The restoration of order and the disarmament of the Japanese army in East India, especially Batavia, is the most troublesome. What London newspapers publish is mostly news about this aspect, which is all related to military affairs. During the Japanese occupation, the Dutch East Indies was given the status of so-called independence, which somewhat sowed the seeds of national consciousness. Moreover, under the banner of the so-called "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere," the degree of cooperation obtained by the local residents seemed to be better than under the rule of Western countries. Britain, the Netherlands, and other countries have also understood this. Churchill also mentioned it in the Parliament before. Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands also made many enlightened promises to East India in her speech on December 6, 1942, announcing that once East India returns to the Netherlands, it will give the local residents greater political participation. In August of this year, after the Japanese army surrendered, the responsibility for the liberation of East India also fell on the Supreme Allied Headquarters of Southeast Asia. However, the troop allocation of the Supreme Allied Headquarters of Southeast Asia was insufficient, and only a small number of troops could land in East India in mid-September. At that time, the Malay people had formed a republican government and seemed to have obtained some of the Japanese army's weapons, so they also possessed considerable military strength. The task of the British army was stated to be only to disarm the Japanese army, liberate the prisoners of war detained in the Dutch East Indies, and maintain order. It declared that it would not interfere in the local residents' independence movement and would adopt a neutral attitude towards the conflict between the residents and the Dutch authorities. However, as long as another armed force exists, the British army's control over East India will not be complete. With the increase of the British army, the control over the island will naturally be strengthened. In addition, the Dutch army, along with the Dutch administrative organization set up in the South Pacific, went to East India, and military conflicts were inevitable. According to British newspapers, the Indonesian authorities were unable to fully enforce orders on the army, and the discipline of the Indonesian army was not very strict, so it often became a threat to public security. Even if the negotiations with the Indonesian political authorities go well, atrocities are still inevitable. Around Christmas, the strength of the British army had been considerably strengthened, and it notified the Indonesian authorities to place all their troops under the command of the British army in order to ensure public security. After this measure is implemented, military actions seem to come to an end.

During this period, the Dutch government felt very棘手(棘手：tricky/thorny/difficult to deal with). Dutch Prime Minister Professor Schermerhorn and East Indies Governor Dr. Van Mook specially came to London before Christmas to exchange views with the authorities before deciding on the steps to be taken. When Schermerhorn and others arrived in London, it happened that British Prime Minister Attlee had gone to the countryside for the Christmas holidays, so the talks did not begin until the 28th. It was generally speculated that the talks would last a long time, at least two days, but they ended in one day. After the meeting, Schermerhorn激授(激授：highly commended) said that the results of the meeting were very satisfactory. Downing Street No. 10 also issued a public statement on this matter, which included two major parts: The first part explained the process of the talks, discussing the situation in Java and the effective actions to be taken to restore local law and order. The Netherlands has fully informed Britain of the enlightened policies it intends to take toward the Indonesian people. The second part explained Britain's responsibilities: (1) To establish security and order as soon as possible so that the Dutch East Indies government can continue to hold talks with the Indonesian representatives. (2) The two countries agree that promoting understanding between the Dutch East Indies authorities and the nationalist movements is one of the main conditions for the completion of the British mission. (3) To do its best to protect the prisoners of war and civilians detained in the Dutch East Indies. We see that this public statement has few new ideas. It does not seem sufficient to explain the policies and attitudes of the two countries. If the Netherlands only relies on what is stated in this public statement to solve the problems of the Dutch East Indies, I am afraid it will not achieve greater success than before. The only hint we can get from this public statement seems to be that Britain is treating the Netherlands and the Indonesian people equally and neutrally, without forgetting that the Indonesian people are indeed just and neutral. Comparing this with Britain's attitude towards southern Vietnam, there is a clear difference. Now East Indies Governor Dr. Mook is said to be preparing to return to the Dutch East Indies, with the aim of negotiating with Indonesian representatives to resolve the political conflict. Before setting off, he first stated that he would not meet with extremists. How things will turn out in the future depends on the evolution of the facts. We do not dare to predict too early whether he can achieve success.

In this political conflict between the Indonesian people and the Dutch authorities, the opinions of most British newspapers seem to be quite sympathetic to the Indonesian people.

### Where is "Peking Man"? Stolen by the Japanese, Now Found in Japan

"Peking Man" was seized by the Japanese army during the war and has now been found in Japan by the occupying authorities. "Peking Man" is one of the earliest known ancestors of modern humans, discovered in 1929 in a limestone cave in Zhoukoudian near Beiping. They were stored in the Peking Union Medical College Hospital and are considered treasures of scientists. The occupying authorities recently received notification from the Japanese government and found the original items inside Tokyo Imperial University. In addition to the "Peking Man" skull, there were also primitive tools, carved ivory ornaments, and charts indicating the excavation site. Letters found prove that the Chinese had secretly hidden them well during the war. Japanese scientists had searched for three years before seizing them. All items are currently temporarily kept by Dr. Whitmore of the U.S. Geological Survey, a scientific advisor to the headquarters, and will be returned to the China Geological Survey in Beiping later. Both "Peking Man" and Java Man are over one million years old, competing for the title of the earliest ancestor of humans. Although "Peking Man" is slightly later in time, they are closer to modern humans and are considered more important. Some of the scientists who studied "Peking Man" were funded by the Rockefeller Foundation and were extremely careful during excavation in the cave. Records were kept of all layers, and the artifacts excavated from each layer can trace the evolution of the inhabitants back to many centuries ago. (United Press, Tokyo, 24th)

### Technicians Mobilized Behind the Scenes to Clear Magnetic Mines - British Admiralty's Dr. Good-Wu Reveals the Truth

— Translated by Our Editorial Department

World War II was not limited to the three battlefields of land, sea, and air. Most interesting were the various facts of how British and American scientists mobilized all their intelligence behind the scenes, engaging in secret scientific warfare with German and Japanese scientists. The experience gained during the war has a profound effect on the struggle to achieve victorious peace. The most prominent drama in technical warfare—we can say it is a war in itself—was the victory in radio. The well-known "radar" is also included in this battle.

Weapon Radar – Manipulating Activities in Many Ways

The development of radar has produced the most amazing results. A British scientist was the first to discover the military significance of radar, namely that radio waves emitted from aircraft could interfere with radio reception. Facts proved that the English Channel was no longer an obstacle. Therefore, all research work related to this new method of reconnaissance, searching, and locating was rigorously carried out. When the great test day arrived in August 1940, everything was ready. During the "Battle of Britain," when the German Air Force launched a full-scale attack on Britain, British pilots shot down many invading Nazi pilots. However, it was the radar experts and technicians manipulating behind the scenes who directed them to their targets.

Radar not only conquered fog and darkness, but it also greatly expanded the application range of electronic physics. Electronic physics has expanded from a relatively small application range to the point where it now occupies almost half of the British government's entire scientific effort. Vacuum tubes, like radio tubes and cathode ray tubes, can be found on almost every battlefield, and perhaps this will be the case in peacetime life as well.

These discoveries and achievements were led by Britain. She exchanged all relevant information with the United States and cooperated closely. The Germans also imitated the new scientific inventions based on some information they obtained from British and American aircraft shot down over the continent. German Admiral Dönitz described how Britain used radar to overcome the submarine threat, saying: "The scientists who invented the method of searching for locations using radio were regarded as the saviors of their country. What made the British win in the submarine war was not their superior strategy or tactics, but entirely the victory in scientific research." The need for physicists in radio warfare was unprecedented! All of Britain's experts were mobilized, and even experts from all over the world were recruited. In addition, many new talents were drawn from various scientific departments.

The main technical war of World War I was the war of materials; this time it was a war of chemists. Britain's various preparations in World War II were based on the strong foundation laid by the chemical industry at that time. At that time, each chemical department already had its large-scale research laboratory. The war of materials continued in this war, but there were few serious problems like those that arose during World War I.

Every major war must have design engineers participating; however, there is a severe lack of such talent. Knowing how to cultivate a good design engineer is a difficult matter.

Magnetic Mines - Displaying Technical Wisdom

In terms of duration, technical achievement, and manpower, the magnetic mine warfare may belong to the same category as radio or anti-submarine warfare; however, it was the first technical war in this war. In terms of interests, it has the same consistency as the other two, and it was also a battle that Britain won and Germany did not expect. Its reverberating power is very important.

In any battle, you must know what weapons the enemy is using. In technical warfare, this is also the case, especially for the defensive side, which relies heavily on its technical wisdom. In October 1939, although Britain knew that the enemy was using magnetic mines, she could not correctly understand the characteristics of magnetic mines, so she had not obtained advanced methods sufficient to truly resist them.

The story of the capture of the first magnetic mine and its analysis has now been widely discussed in newspapers and on the radio. People are talking about "degaussing," which is the electrical safety belt for ships. But that is only part of the story, because the "degaussing" method is only a partial defense. It is very obvious that after the enemy lays mines, they need to be cleared as soon as possible if possible.

The German magnetic mines were improved based on the style of World War I. If a magnetic steel rod supports a horizontal axis in the middle, allowing it to rotate and roll freely on a straight line (like a see-saw board, replacing the horizontal line method on a compass), then the north pole needle of this steel rod will move down to a certain angle. The size of this angle depends on how far it is from the north magnetic pole (in its own position, it will shift to the horizontal plane. On the geomagnetic equator, it does not move down. If it is south of the geomagnetic equator, then the south pole needle will move down). By installing this needle with a self-adjusting spiral spring, the force of the spring can be accurately determined, causing the needle to move towards the equal or opposite force of the spring. Under the bottom of a steel ship, the magnetic activity is greater than usual, and a balanced needle will move down, causing electrical contact. The technical story about magnetic mine clearance will be added in another article.

The railway lines under the jurisdiction of the Changchun Railway Company form a trapezoid. The east-west line runs from Manzhouli through Harbin to Suifenhe. The north-south line runs from Shenyang to Dalian, returning through Shenyang and Changchun, and finally to Harbin. It passes through 1,770 kilometers, totaling 3,500 Chinese miles.

### On the Northeastern Trapezoidal Railway Line - 3,500 Miles of Dusty Journey - Impressions After Observation by Central News Agency Reporter

Modernized Buildings – Empty Shells Remain

Shenyang, Dalian, Changchun, and Harbin are the four major towns in the Northeast. The conditions of these four cities are sufficient to represent the face of the Northeast. The current situation of the Northeast after the restoration, according to the impressions obtained by the reporter, can be summarized as follows: What remains in the Northeast today are thousands upon thousands of solid, huge, and modernized empty-shell buildings. Restoration still requires our greatest efforts. The modernized railway transportation in the Northeast is now in a state of paralysis. The Changchun Railway's trapezoidal railway line is still running trains, but the number of trains has been greatly reduced, the roadbed has not been maintained for a long time, and the train operation is unstable. Passenger trains from Changchun via Shenyang to Dalian run once a day in opposite directions. The Harbin-Changchun section runs three times a day in opposite directions. Passenger travel on both sections is extremely crowded. The order along the way is not good, and it is extremely cold, and passengers consider it most fortunate to arrive at their destination safely.

Harbin, Changchun, and Shenyang Municipal Administration – Gradual Progress

The four cities of Harbin, Changchun, Shenyang, and Dalian, except for Dalian, all have mayors who are promoting municipal administration. Shenyang's municipal administration has made the most rapid progress in difficult circumstances. Work on public works and education has already begun and has achieved considerable success. A large amount of materials and funds are being prepared to welcome the National Army. Changchun's municipal administration is easier to develop than Shenyang's because society is more stable. Work on finance, education, industry, and police has been carried out according to plan. The municipal foundation of Harbin has not moved, but the social order is still good. In addition to strengthening education work, other tasks only need to be continued.

Most Factories – Recovery is Imminent

The industries of the four cities, except for Changchun and Harbin, Shenyang and Dalian are highly industrialized areas. Although 70% of the factories have been destroyed, they are not difficult to restore. Commerce in the Northeast was quite developed in the four cities in the past, with Shenyang being the most prosperous. Since the Japanese surrender, commerce has declined, and stores have closed one after another. What is displayed in large stores are all crude Japanese daily necessities. There are many peddlers in the four cities, and many of them are set up by Japanese women.

A Leather Overcoat – Priced at 200,000 Yuan

The famous leather coats of the Northeast are now hard to find. Currently, a better light fur coat is priced at around 200,000 yuan. In the future, the prosperity of commerce in the Northeast depends on the restoration of water and land transportation. The people here are in great need of education. The reporter believes that the large-scale import of news materials and the universal supply of textbooks are urgent tasks. (30th)

### Foreign Exchange Should Be Determined As Soon As Possible

The foreign exchange problem has been rumored for days, and it is impossible to know the truth. Finance Minister Yu recently stated that it will be announced soon. Reports from the capital say that it has already been determined, but according to news from the Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Finance in Shanghai, it is absolutely not true. Whether it is true or not can only be verified by facts. Our opinion is that we hope it is true and that it will be determined and announced as soon as possible.

We know that labor strikes are surging and society is turbulent. Although there are many reasons for this, most of it is due to high prices and drastic fluctuations. We also know that high prices and drastic fluctuations also have many reasons, but most of it is due to the instability of the currency value. The currency value should be stabilized as soon as possible. Yesterday's editorial in this newspaper briefly explained its general principles.

How can the currency value be stabilized? The indirect factors are certainly many, but the direct and fastest way cannot but start with determining the foreign exchange rate. Because the legal currency itself has no inherent value, its reserves do not depend on materials, but on the foreign exchange funds held by the country, so the legal currency has long been disconnected from materials, and its value is completely dependent on the exchange rate. Therefore, determining foreign exchange is tantamount to determining the currency value, and determining the currency value is stabilizing prices and stabilizing life.

Since the restoration, the uncertainty of the exchange rate of pseudo-currency initially caused a huge wave of prices. After the exchange rate of pseudo-currency was determined, the failure to determine the foreign exchange rate repeatedly caused a huge wave of prices. In this process, speculators' stirring up trouble and hoarders' fueling the flames should certainly bear a large part of the responsibility, but the reason why these speculators and hoarders are happy to stir up trouble and fuel the flames is nothing more than a desire for profit. In other words, taking advantage of the uncertainty of foreign exchange, they secretly peek and manipulate as much as possible, and even repeatedly spread rumors to grab temporary windfall profits. But who knows that the lives of the public and the order of social security are greatly affected by them! Therefore, it is these speculators and hoarders who squeeze the livelihoods of ordinary people, and it is the authorities who are indecisive and cannot act immediately that enable these speculators and hoarders to squeeze the livelihoods of ordinary people. If the government still does not determine the exchange rate to achieve the effect of determining the currency value, then "Although I did not kill Bo Ren, Bo Ren died because of me," the authorities should not be indifferent.

We believe that today, to eliminate labor strikes and stabilize people's livelihoods, it is not possible to solve the problem by simply increasing wages today and annual bonuses tomorrow. Only by stabilizing the currency value as soon as possible with all possible strength can prices be prevented from rising. And the method of stabilizing the currency value is to determine the foreign exchange rate as soon as possible, which is the most direct and appropriate method. Of course, at the beginning of the announcement of the exchange rate, all prices and wages need a degree of adjustment. During this adjustment period, some disturbances are still inevitable, and this disturbance may be even more intense than in the past and present. But once the adjustment is completed, the amplitude of all prices will ultimately not be the same as it is now, although it may not be possible to be completely quiet and completely return to the usual state. The most undesirable thing is that the government abandons its policy halfway. If the exchange rate is announced, there must be a fixed opinion and determination, otherwise indecision and inconsistency will only give speculators and hoarders one more opportunity. A better policy may even receive very bad results!

As for high exchange rates or low exchange rates, high prices or low prices, the so-called "different people see different things, with benefits and harms equally divided," the research and discussions from all sides in the past few months have also been detailed and exhaustive, and there is no need to repeat them. But looking at the opinions of the reader Yang Qingtao disclosed in today's newspaper, we can get a glimpse of the psychology of ordinary people, who already believe that this issue is a matter of urgency and can no longer allow the government to let a few speculators and hoarders speculate and make a fortune. The most fearful thing in the world is social injustice. All sources of chaos and misfortune evolve from "injustice." Low exchange rates lead to high prices, and high exchange rates lead to low prices. Of course, different people see different things. But which policy is beneficial to the general public and which policy can stabilize the livelihoods of the general public? Just look at the rumor-fueled price increases of the past two or three days, and you can think about it more than halfway. We will not provide one-sided opinions for the time being, and ask the government to make a consideration of the overall situation. But consideration is possible, delay is not; careful research is possible, letting rumors speculate is not. Therefore, no matter how high or low the exchange rate is, what we most hope for today is that the authorities determine and implement this point as soon as possible. If this exchange rate is set very appropriately, so that all parties can obtain considerable satisfaction, it will naturally be welcomed by us; even if overall planning is taken into account and it is not easy to achieve in practice, and perhaps one aspect will feel disappointed, but it is much better than guessing, rising and falling without certainty, making the entire people's lives long in turmoil, the entire industrial production long in stagnation, and the entire import and export trade long in blockage and stagnation.

Some believe that the price difference between domestic and foreign countries is too great today, and it is not easy to maintain if it is hastily regulated at this time. This is not without reason. However, in comparing two evils, we can only choose the lesser. In order to alleviate the suffering of the people and the precariousness of the economic sector, we believe that resolving the matter as soon as possible is still more beneficial than delaying indefinitely.

Of course, stabilizing the currency value cannot rely solely on determining the foreign exchange rate. If the consultation conference fails and military spending cannot be reduced, currency cannot be tightened, and production cannot be promoted, even a determined exchange rate may not be maintained. However, the determination of the exchange rate is, after all, a necessary condition for stabilizing the currency value and stabilizing prices, so we still agree to determine it as soon as possible.

### Nationalize Gold and Raise Exchange Rates: Emergency Measures to Stabilize the National Economy

— Yang Qingtao

(1) Eliminating Speculative Activities

To stabilize the national economy, the most pressing issues now are to raise the value of our currency and suppress commodity prices. Currently, the value of our currency is falling daily, commodity prices are soaring, followed by workers striking to demand higher wages, and factories shrinking due to unsustainable burdens. This not only constantly threatens the livelihoods of the general public but also makes it impossible to establish national industries. Therefore, even if a comprehensive national economic policy has not yet been fully determined, at least emergency measures should be taken to raise the value of our currency, suppress commodity prices, and stabilize the economic lives of the people.

In recent months, commodity prices have been rising rapidly for many reasons; there is no single remedy. For example, increasing production to balance supply and demand; facilitating transportation to ensure smooth distribution of goods. These fundamental issues cannot be resolved overnight. The emergency measures that we are now requesting the government to take are to immediately issue an order to stop speculative activities. Because speculative activities create a mentality among the general public that belittles the value of legal tender and disregards government credit, leading to a rush to exchange currency for goods, which in turn induces further price increases, higher worker wages, and continued issuance of currency, which then further fuels speculative activities. The result of this vicious cycle is only the creation of a small number of nouveau riche through gambling-like speculation, while harming the economic lives of the majority of the people and accelerating the country's financial and national economic collapse! Today, the government authorities are sitting idly by, seemingly unaware of the activities of speculators in the Shanghai market, which is truly perplexing!

The leading forces in today's speculative activities are exchange rate rumors and gold speculation. For example, on January 28th and 29th, rumors of exchange rate changes and soaring gold prices triggered a surge in all other commodity prices. Naturally, the government should swiftly crack down on any hoarding and speculative activities, but the most urgent issues to resolve are the foreign exchange problem and the gold problem.

(2) Nationalize Gold

Gold speculation leads other speculative activities; rising gold prices further stimulate the rise in other goods. To curb speculation and suppress commodity prices, I advocate and suggest that the government immediately issue an order to nationalize all gold in the country.

The policy of nationalizing gold is based on the following reasons and needs to be implemented as soon as possible:

First, many people who made fortunes from the national crisis and victory since the war have converted their assets into gold. Nationalizing gold can prevent these people from freely converting their gold into currency to maintain their wealth and extravagance, while the general public struggles to survive. Granted, not everyone who holds gold obtained it illegally by exploiting the national crisis or victory, but they are a minority, and certainly not the poor. If the national economy can be put on a stable track, then even if these non-poor few experience temporary inconvenience (because nationalizing gold does not mean confiscating gold, so they can avoid sacrifice), it is still feasible.

Second, the Bretton Woods Agreement stipulates that each country's government should contribute a fixed amount of gold as a reserve for the World Bank. Our government has already ratified the agreement and will have to pay the full amount of gold in the future. However, our cash reserves are not large, so we must not allow gold to be dispersed into private hands, but should concentrate it in the government. For this reason, our country must adopt a policy of nationalizing gold. Furthermore, future international trade must be conducted by the state through the World Bank, and privately held gold cannot be used as a benchmark for international trade settlements, so privately owned gold will be worthless.

Third, once the policy of nationalizing gold is implemented, not only will the government's gold reserves increase, but also, by stopping gold speculation and then stopping all speculative activities, it will reduce a large number of parasitic individuals who engage in gambling-like speculation without producing anything, and save a lot of luxury waste caused by the sudden wealth of these speculators. This can directly and indirectly increase national wealth.

For the aforementioned reasons, nationalizing gold is beneficial and harmless and should be implemented as soon as possible. As for the implementation methods of the gold nationalization policy, the following suggestions are offered:

First, immediately prohibit private buying and selling of gold, ban gold markets, and arrest violators.

Second, the government should designate reliable banks or institutions to purchase privately held gold at a reasonable legal price. Gold prices should be paid in bonds, not cash, to avoid increasing the amount of legal tender in circulation. Third, gold purchases should be conducted in three phases: the first phase, assumed to be two months, pays bonds at the current reasonable price; the second phase, also assumed to be two months, pays bonds at a reduced price; after this period, in the third phase, all privately held gold will be confiscated without compensation. However, whether buying or confiscating, responsible receipts must be given to prevent embezzlement and corruption.

(3) Raise Foreign Exchange Rates

Regarding the foreign exchange rate issue that has been hotly debated recently, we believe that it should be decided as soon as possible, and it should be appropriately raised. Some people advocate lowering the exchange rate, that is, devaluing legal tender, to protect national industries. However, the rumors of exchange rate changes and the devaluation of legal tender around January 28th immediately stimulated a surge in gold prices and general commodity prices, indicating that if the exchange rate were truly lowered, it would inevitably induce a surge in commodity prices first. From this practical experience, it should be known that the result of lowering the exchange rate is only to create chaos in finance and commodity prices, which will not promote export trade and will not protect national industries.

Conversely, raising the exchange rate will allow foreign goods to flow in, which will help suppress commodity prices. Furthermore, our country's economic construction in the future will require the purchase of new machinery from advanced countries, and raising the exchange rate will allow us to purchase large quantities of this necessary machinery, which will help economic construction and industrial revitalization.

As mentioned above, whether from a theoretical or factual perspective, lowering the exchange rate only shows its disadvantages and not its benefits; raising the exchange rate has more benefits than disadvantages. Therefore, we oppose lowering the exchange rate and advocate raising the exchange rate. As for methods to promote foreign exports and protect national industries, relying on lowering the exchange rate is not the solution, as mentioned earlier (because as soon as the news of lowering the exchange rate spreads, domestic commodity prices will soar first). Instead, the government should be requested to sign suitable trade agreements with friendly countries, stipulating the types and quantities of imported goods and the levels and prices of exported goods, or use other economic plans to help, in order to solve the problem.

The exchange rate should be decided as soon as possible, and it should be higher than the current black market exchange rate. It should be known that lowering the exchange rate and devaluing legal tender not only do not help export trade and national industries in fact, but also induce a surge in commodity prices, and government credit will be damaged as a result!

(4) Hoping for Decisive Implementation

Since the victory, government authorities have considered economic measures too much, allowing a few speculators to take the opportunity to stir up trouble, commodity prices have risen endlessly, and the people's livelihood has become extremely precarious! In order to stabilize people's livelihoods, promote construction, and also to protect the government and enhance its prestige, we specially offer the above humble opinions. It is hoped that the governing authorities, in addition to quickly discussing and determining a comprehensive and concrete economic plan, will also take emergency measures in advance, immediately issue an order to nationalize gold, stop speculation, raise exchange rates, suppress commodity prices, and implement decisively, without further hesitation.

### Over Two Thousand Workers Regain Freedom: Electricity Strike Resolved: Company Announces Workers to Quickly Return to Work: Leaders of the Strike Arrested and Brought to Justice: Mayor Qian Announces Handling of the Incident

The electricity strike at the Municipal Electricity Company had been deadlocked for many days. Yesterday afternoon around 3:00 PM, after workers' families went to the factory to request the union to release the workers to return home for the New Year, a conflict occurred inside the factory. The police bureau sent police to suppress it, and all the workers left the factory one after another. The company also announced post-strike measures. The details are recorded as follows:

Sincerely Persuading a Few Trouble Makers

The company's strike began on the 23rd of last month. The workers did not make demands to the company but immediately went on strike. Committee member Wang Xianqing of the Municipal Party Department and others went to the factory to persuade them, but it had no effect. The workers also refused to send representatives to the Municipal Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation. After the newly appointed Director Wu Kaixian of the Social Affairs Bureau took office, he believed that the electricity company was a public utility, and the municipal government had long issued an order prohibiting workers in public utilities from going on strike or slowing down work. This situation could not be allowed to continue, so he ordered the factory workers to send representatives to the bureau for mediation. On the 30th, the factory sent Ouyang Zirun, Huang Hongxun, and others to the bureau. The other five public utility unions also sent representatives to jointly persuade them. After Director Wu and Special Commissioner Lu Jingshi of the Ministry of Social Affairs and others sincerely persuaded them, the opinions of labor and management were close to converging. Ouyang and others were deeply moved and expressed their determination to take full responsibility and persuade the workers to return to work. However, when Ouyang and others left the Social Affairs Bureau, they suddenly changed their minds, refusing to allow representatives of the other five public utility unions to go with them to persuade the workers. At the same time, after returning to the factory, they did not convene a meeting of all the workers but only held a meeting of the board of directors and supervisors, still advocating continuing the strike, and some even advocated cutting off the power to coerce the company.

Prohibiting Action, Workers Resentful

Since the company's strike began, the union organized patrols to prevent workers from going out. At the same time, all the workers were organized into groups, with names being taken at any time to prevent workers from leaving. Most of the workers believed that food and clothing in the factory were inadequate, and many fell ill because of the cold weather. However, because of the strict supervision of the patrols, they could not move freely and were extremely resentful. Those who expressed dissenting opinions and advocated returning to work were beaten by the patrols or insulted in public. Some even suffered mental breakdowns due to nervous stimulation. After the workers' families learned of this, they requested military and police agencies to rescue them. Here is a copy of a document presented by dozens of people, including Mrs. Yin Wang and Mrs. Yang Le, to the Garrison Headquarters on the 29th of last month: "We, the undersigned, have family members working at the Shanghai Electric Power Plant in Yangshupu. On the 23rd of this month, they were ordered by the union to stay in the factory and strike. It has now been six days and nights. They are sleeping on the cement floor in the factory at night without blankets, which has led to mutual infection and illness. The strike committee absolutely prohibits workers from going out, and even for special leave, it is only limited to two or three hours, which really hinders personal freedom. Therefore, we submit this document to your department, requesting you to find a way to rescue them. This would be a great kindness."

Families Petition, Conflict Occurs

After receiving the presentation, the Headquarters forwarded it to the Municipal Government for investigation. While the Municipal Government was handing it over to the Police Bureau for investigation, around 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, more than a hundred family members of the workers, believing that the workers had been on strike for a long time, their bodies were exhausted, and the New Year was approaching, urging reunion, went to the factory in Yangshupu to petition the union, requesting the workers to be allowed to return home. However, the union resolutely refused. The workers inside the factory could no longer bear it and resisted, resulting in a conflict with the patrols. The order was temporarily disrupted, and two or three people were injured.

Police Suppression, Workers Released

After receiving the news, the Yangshupu Police Bureau immediately sent police to suppress the situation and maintain order. The patrols refused to obey and obstructed workers who voluntarily wanted to go home. The police arrested the ringleaders. At this point, the workers inside the factory were as if they had been granted amnesty, joyfully leaving the factory with their wives and children to return home. The workers in the power generation engine room remained in the factory to continue working and maintain electricity. A dispute was quickly resolved, and order was restored. Furthermore, the police bureau also arrested Ouyang Zirun and Huang Hongxun, the leaders of the union, who were negotiating at the Social Affairs Bureau at the time, believing that Ouyang and others were responsible for instigating and manipulating the strike from the beginning. They will be transferred to the court within 24 hours for legal proceedings.

Company Notice: Quickly Return to Work

After the workers left the factory, the company issued a notice, the original text of which is as follows: (1) All employees of the company should return to their original positions and work immediately. (2) The disputed points (including seniority-based salary increases) have been submitted to the Municipal Government for arbitration. (3) Employees of the company's accounting department were forced to strike and were unable to settle salaries and wages before the New Year. However, in order to take care of the employees' needs for the New Year, they will be allowed to receive an appropriate advance payment on February 1st. It is heard that the company also expressed its willingness to accept the workers' reasonable demands as much as possible, in order to promote harmonious relations between labor and management and jointly seek the development of business.

Mayor Explains the Handling of the Incident

Mayor Qian issued a statement last night regarding the electricity strike, the original text of which is as follows: "The employees of the Municipal Electricity Company initiated a strike due to the company's dismissal of Shen Han, a worker who was stealing electricity. They gathered more than 2,800 workers from various departments at the Yangshupu factory, organized patrols, prohibited workers from taking action, and hindered personal freedom. The workers' representatives, Ouyang Furun, Huang Hongxun, and others, put forward eleven demands. The Social Affairs Bureau summoned both labor and management for mediation. The management invited the responsible persons to the meeting, but the workers strongly demanded that the management personnel go to the factory for negotiations and refused to attend. After the newly appointed Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau took office, he repeatedly and earnestly ordered them to resume work and conduct mediation. Although the representatives complied with the order and attended the meeting, they still did not inform the workers to resume work. On the one hand, they made various unreasonable requests, forcing the management to accept them. Director Wu repeatedly advised and ordered them to resume work. The representatives pretended to obey, but in fact, they never complied. On the 30th, Director Wu personally attended the mediation. The representatives expressed their acceptance and stated that they would be responsible for guiding and complying with the order to resume work. At that time, the representatives of the other five public utility workers were deeply moved and were willing to go together to guide them. However, as soon as they left the Social Affairs Bureau, they made excuses and refused. It was reported that after returning to the factory, they did not convene a general meeting but only held a meeting of the board of directors and supervisors to oppose resuming work. At 10:00 AM on the 31st, the union's board of directors and supervisors convened a general meeting and forced the workers not to go home. At the same time, the Municipal Government received a complaint from the families of the workers, including Mrs. Gu Wang and Mrs. Yang Le, requesting the rescue of the workers detained by the union's patrols. The words were urgent. In the afternoon of the same day, according to a report from the Yangshuqing Police Sub-bureau, after 3:00 PM in the afternoon, the families and relatives of the workers gathered at the factory gate, requesting the release of the workers to go home. Some of the detained workers wanted to go out but were forcibly stopped by the patrols, resulting in a dispute. I immediately ordered the police bureau to go to suppress the situation, but the patrols refused to obey and still obstructed workers who voluntarily wanted to go home. In view of the above-mentioned illegal acts, I ordered the police bureau to arrest the representatives who instigated and manipulated the workers, Ouyang Zirun, Huang Hongxun, and those who disturbed the order on the spot, and send them to the court for legal proceedings. Currently, the detained workers have all returned home separately or are working as usual.

Harm to Order, Hindrance of Freedom

Since the occurrence of the electricity strike, the Municipal Government has made repeated efforts to mediate, and has done its best to persuade the management to accept all reasonable demands put forward by the union. At the same time, it has advised the workers to respect national laws and resume work immediately. Unfortunately, the workers of the electricity company were manipulated by a few employees, not only being fickle but also making endless demands. The workers formed so-called patrols, detained workers and prevented them from working, and obstructed the military and police from maintaining order. Their actions went beyond the scope of the law, not only endangering social order but also directly hindering the freedom of the workers themselves. In addition to arresting all the people today and immediately sending them to the court for legal proceedings, I deeply hope that the company's workers will resume work as usual immediately. As for the various demands originally put forward by the workers, they will still be handled according to law. The Municipal Government has always maintained a fair attitude towards labor-management disputes, handles them reasonably according to legal procedures, and will never be partial. In the future, if anyone engages in unauthorized strikes or slowdowns in violation of the regulations, for the sake of stabilizing social order and maintaining the welfare of the people, they will be strictly dealt with and not be tolerated in the slightest."

### Most Labor Strikes in Various Industries Resolved: Only Cantonese Cuisine Industry Has Not Achieved Results

Labor strikes in various industries have generally become calmer. The details are as follows:

(1) The strike at the English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury was completely resolved yesterday, and the Evening Post was published as usual yesterday. During the negotiations between labor and management, representatives from the Social Affairs Bureau mediated, and the management expressed acceptance in principle of all the demands put forward by labor.

(2) The employees of the main and branch stores of Zhengwei Pharmacy went on strike. After the Social Affairs Bureau mediated once, in addition to the two conditions put forward by labor, such as adjusting salaries and not dismissing employees without reason, the management indicated that they might accept them. Yesterday, the two sides were close to agreement on the year-end bonus issue, so all employees resumed work yesterday.

(3) The labor-management dispute at the British-owned tram company in the city was still being mediated by Wei Chenghao of the Social Affairs Bureau at the bureau yesterday. The management representative, Fang Aishi, and the labor representative, Zhu Yongye, and four others, were present. It was only resolved from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM. The following is an excerpt of the various conditions: (1) Adding one person to sell tickets on the trailer, to be implemented within one week. (2) Working hours not exceeding eight hours. (3) Each day each conductor (太平賞） buys in each has twenty yuan, the head of each band eight yuan (班頭各八十元). (4) Employees' sick leave, after being certified by the company's doctor, will be paid salary as usual, and medical expenses will be paid by the company. (5) Raising the base salary will be submitted to the municipal government for decision. (6) Retirement benefits will be handled according to the decision of the electricity company. (7) Internal workers will receive one day's pay upon promotion. (8) Road workers salary to increase .2 from $.5.

(4) The China Silk Mill was originally taken over by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. Now it has been transferred to the China Silk Company. More than 200 unemployed male and female workers in the factory flocked to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition. After the association sent representatives to mediate, it was decided to officially start work on February 7, adding 45 workers, and then adding 45 workers on February 21, and all will resume work by the end of February.

(5) The slowdown in work in the Cantonese cuisine industry continued to develop yesterday because the management still had no reply, and several companies, including Hongkou Zhangji, joined in voluntarily. In order to seek an early resolution, the labor side sent a letter to the union urging the management to resume negotiations, but as of now, the management has still not expressed any opinion, so work cannot be resumed today.

(6) The workers of the China Chemical Industry Cooperative demanded a year-end bonus. Yesterday, Zhou Tianpeng of the Social Affairs Bureau summoned both parties for mediation. Because the lunar new year was approaching, it was too late to make a decision, so the management first lent each male worker 50,000 yuan and each female worker 40,000 yuan, and the amount would be decided after the lunar new year.

### Changes in Municipal Government Personnel

There were changes in the internal personnel of the Municipal Government yesterday. It is reported that Sun Qinchi, Director of the General Affairs Department, resigned due to the complexity of affairs and the inability to bear the physical strain. He has been approved and transferred to the position of Counselor. Shi Bangrui, a specialist committee member, will succeed him in the vacant position. At the same time, a secretariat was established, and Counselor Wang Zhaochao was transferred to be the director of the secretariat. Chen Xiping, the original deputy director of the General Affairs Department, was transferred to be the deputy director of the secretariat, and Tao Rui, a specialist committee member, succeeded him as the deputy director of the General Affairs Department.

At that time, he will take the Jiangwan Airport route and welcome reporters from the city to accompany him.

### Memorial Association for Those Who Died in the Disaster: Exposing the Crimes of the Enemy and Puppets

The members of the Shanghai Anti-Japanese War Memorial Association for Those Who Died in the Disaster have all suffered the brutal oppression of the enemy and puppets for the past eight years. Therefore, the association is actively carrying out the work of exposing the crimes of the enemy and puppets. It has specially submitted the first batch of names of enemy military police criminals reported by the members, totaling 39 cases including enemy military police Messi, and their criminal status, to the High Court for prosecution in accordance with the law, requesting strict punishment in accordance with the law, in order to uphold justice and comfort the people.

### 1945 Year-End Summary: Regulations for Handling Money Shops

[Our Dispatch] The Shanghai Money Shops Association's Board of Directors, at its twelfth meeting, decided on the following four measures for handling the end of the 1945 accounting year: (1) The closing date for the 1945 year-end summary is February 1st. (2) Deposits and outstanding interest are to be settled up to January 27th. (3) Interest on deposits after January 27th will be combined with February's interest for settlement, while outstanding interest will be settled up to January 31st. (4) The exchange house will announce the time for collecting bills during the year-end closing period. In addition, the interest rates for current accounts in January have been jointly drafted by the Association and the Bankers' Association, with 9 yuan for deposit interest and 70 yuan for outstanding interest.

### Strengthening Defense Forces: Increased Amusement Tax to Be Implemented Starting Today

To strengthen the defense forces, the municipal government and local figures have jointly established the National Defense Corps. In addition to seeking separate means for raising temporary expenses such as uniforms, the necessary recurring expenses were requested to be borne by the government through the Defense Committee. However, municipal expenses are vast, and tax revenues are insufficient, making it necessary to seek additional funds to cover them. After investigation, the amusement tax rate, according to Article 2, Paragraph 2 of the central government's promulgated Ordinance on Banquets and Amusement Tax, should not exceed 50% of the original price. The current rate is 30%, so a reasonable increase can be made. This was resolved at the 17th municipal meeting on January 18th of this year, following central government regulations, setting the rate at 50% of the price, still collected by the entertainment industry, effective from February 1st of this year, with 20% allocated to strengthen the development of the Municipal National Defense Corps.

### Business Automobiles: Approved Rental Rates

The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, due to the lack of standards in business automobile rental rates, has specifically unified and approved the following rates: Passenger cars: 1,200 National Currency per trip, calculated in 20-minute increments, with an additional 250 yuan for every 5 minutes exceeding the limit. Freight cars: 2,400 yuan per trip, calculated in half-hour increments, with an additional 400 yuan for every 5 minutes exceeding the limit. These rates will be implemented from February 1st of this year, and no extra tips may be charged. The Bureau has already notified the City's Taxi Association and the Freight Car Association of the above measures, instructing all automobile companies to comply.

### UNRRA to Sell Part of Its Supplies, Proceeds Still to Be Used for Relief

[Our Dispatch] According to Shen Weitai, Director of the Translation and Compilation Department of UNRRA, to reporters, UNRRA will sell a portion of its supplies on the market, and the proceeds will mainly be used for emergency relief and public assistance. Furthermore, for inland provinces such as Shanxi and Henan, where transportation is inconvenient and relief supplies cannot be transported in large quantities, the emergency measure is to convert the supplies into cash and remit them.

Processing and Modification Also Require Cash

Also, some of the special supplies allocated to China by UNRRA need to be processed and modified before they can be distributed. The cost of this processing and modification also requires cash, so it is necessary to sell a portion of the supplies, and the proceeds will still be used for post-war relief. As for the clothing donated by foreigners, because the donors specified in advance that the beneficiaries should receive them directly, containing commemorative significance, and because some of them are not suitable for men to wear, they still cannot be sold, but will be directly distributed.

Medical Experts to Lecture in Shanghai

Nine foreign medical experts hired by UNRRA, including Dr. Kilmon, previously assisted China in training medical personnel in Chongqing. They will arrive in Shanghai one after another at the end of this month and plan to give public lectures in Shanghai starting on February 9th, discussing the latest medical inventions and new advances in medicine. The nine experts each have their own specialties, and the lecture topics include maternal and child health, public health, nursing, orthopedics, tuberculosis, internal medicine, nursing administration, bacteriology, thoracic surgery, and medical experiments. In recent years, Shanghai has been isolated from Europe and the United States, and the medical community is eager for new knowledge. It is expected that this academic lecture will provide new insights to the city's medical community. UNRRA is currently preparing to host the experts, and the time and location of the lectures will be announced by the organization in the coming days.

### Post Office Open During Lunar New Year, Following Sunday Schedule

The Shanghai Postal Administration announced that February 2nd, the Lunar New Year holiday, will see the Administration and its branches operate on the usual Sunday schedule. To avoid delays, the Administration is providing the following instructions for sending domestic airmail: (1) In addition to the regular postage, airmail fees are calculated per 10 grams or fraction thereof. (2) Sufficient postage must be paid for this type of mail based on its weight. (3) Senders should use airmail envelopes as much as possible; otherwise, each item must have an airmail label or be marked with the word "Airmail." The Shanghai Postal Administration's Financial Affairs Department announced that the phrase "payee has a financial account book at the post office or savings and remittance branch" in the second announcement of January 26th refers to the payee having a

Savings Account Book

at the draft cashing office. The Parcel Department of the Postal Administration's Parcel Business Division announced that the Guangzhou branch has temporarily suspended acceptance of parcels destined for Guangzhou since January 28th. To avoid accumulation, all parcels and small packages destined for Guangzhou from all branches in this area should be temporarily suspended from acceptance. Today, due to the Lunar New Year's Eve, all post offices will

Extend Hours

until 6:00 PM to facilitate the cashing of various drafts for citizens. On the first and second days of the Lunar New Year, the post office will still be open as usual, but the Postal Savings and Remittance departments will be temporarily closed. Regular business will resume on the third day.

### Replacements for American Troops Soon to Arrive in China

Although the work of American troops returning home after their service was temporarily concluded in mid-December of last year with the closure of the US Army Withdrawal Service Group, the US government and the headquarters of the US military stationed in various locations continue to consider the issue of their demobilization from time to time. In addition, when the US Senate inspection team and US Secretary of the Army Patterson came to China, 700-800 American soldiers here who requested retirement submitted a petition, prompting the US side to take action on the demobilization issue as soon as possible. However, when US Secretary of the Army Patterson passed through Shanghai, he solemnly stated that no matter to what extent the US military demobilization progresses, the US military's policy toward China will remain unchanged, as the United States has a fixed direction in its policy toward China. At the same time, General Wedemeyer also repeatedly stated that all American troops sent back to their country will be replaced by new troops to take over their work. According to US military sources, starting in mid-month, qualified American soldiers will have the opportunity to return home, with officers and soldiers prioritizing based on their service points and time. At the same time, Washington is also considering how to send another batch of American troops to work in China.

### Car Fire

### Yang Linsen Rescues British Military Officers, British Consulate Sends Letter of Thanks

Yang Linsen, an employee of the Sino-American Japanese Daily News, encountered three British military officers who had escaped from a prisoner-of-war camp in Qingpu County, 50 kilometers from Shanghai, in January 1941. Yang risked his life to escort them to a guerrilla area, from where they were transferred to the rear. After the victory of the war, Yang wrote to the British Consulate to inquire about the whereabouts of the three men. Recently, he received a reply from Major Brett, the liaison officer of the consulate, stating that "the three officers have safely returned to London and express their infinite respect and gratitude to Yang for his rescue."

Rock Crushing Machines Have Extremely High Output

The Xiamen Road Machinery Factory repairs all the Public Works Bureau's vehicle parts, road machinery, motors, and other equipment. The work inside is very fast. A road roller is being repaired and will be ready for use in road construction after completion.

There are three rock crushing machines in the Kader Road Rock Crushing Factory. Although they are more than 20 years old, their efficiency is still considerable. Large stones are transported from Suzhou, Hangzhou, Songjiang, and other places, and then placed one by one into the mouth of the rock crushing machine. Once powered on, the large iron cylinder lying horizontally on the rock crushing machine rotates. The cylinder wall is divided into small holes of 1.5, 1, 0.5, and 0.25 sizes. The crushed stones are sieved out according to their size from the holes. With this production method, 100 cubic meters of stones can be produced every day. However, the consumption is very high. The sand and gravel used by the Public Works Bureau for road construction, machinery repair, and house building are all borrowed from the rock crushing factory. The asphalt plant next door refines asphalt. The old asphalt dug up from the roads during road repairs is not discarded. The asphalt plant combines it and re-refines it, and the residue can still be used for other purposes.

Sewage Treatment Works Well

Many people think that the waste in our regular flush toilets is simply flushed into the sewers and flows into the rivers. In fact, the process is not that simple. The situation is slightly different in the former French Concession and the International Settlement. In the French Concession, there is a circular iron cover next to the alley or road, which is the storage pipe for the waste from flush toilets. After a small-scale adjustment, solids often evaporate into gas and escape, while liquids flow into the sewers and into the rivers. In the International Settlement, there are currently three sewage treatment plants. The sewage in the Dixwell Road and North Sichuan Road area flows to the Bazilu plant. The area east of Henan Road flows to Yangshupu. The area west of Henan Road flows to Beixinjing. This route is 30 miles long, which means that the excrement of those living west of Henan Road must travel 30 miles to reach Beixinjing.

Solid Waste Can Be Used as Fertilizer

There is a small house painted in cream and green on the sidewalk at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Seymour Road, which people find inexplicable and may think is some kind of electrical installation. Originally, this is a very large sewage station and pump, which is the main pipe. There is one such facility every three miles. Each time the water is pumped, three gallons of water are needed, so the waste reaches the bottom and becomes liquid. When passing through the water storage station, the pump can raise the water and help it move forward. After passing through ten times, it reaches the final large pump at the Beixinjing Treatment Plant. There, four million gallons of water can be pumped every day. The water is then sent to more than ten pools, and the power of the generator adjusts the air, so it is constantly flowing for twenty-four hours a day. In winter, it takes about fifteen to eighteen hours for the sewage to be treated to a relatively clean level before it is transferred to another pool. After a waterfall-style water flushing, it flows into the Suzhou River, which can prevent sewage and wastewater from flowing into the river and affecting sanitation. It is said that in summer, after six hours of treatment, the sewage becomes extremely clean water, several times cleaner than the water in the Suzhou River. As for the remaining dirty water, it is flowed into many other pools, with more than 30 pools rotating to settle and dry, which can be used by the villagers as fertilizer for farming. The results of chemical experiments have shown that this fertilizer is more nutritious than untreated fertilizer. Rainwater flows directly through the ditches. There are currently five completed rainwater weirs, and the largest sixth weir, the Maigen Road weir, is being repaired and is scheduled to be completed by the end of June. The floods this summer can be avoided as a result.

Finally, we visited the sawmill on Qimei Road in Jiangwan, which uses the machines formerly used by the Japanese to make plywood to saw practical wood blocks. The sizes are different and there are specified dimensions. On average, 8,000 board feet of wood can be sawn every day, each board foot being one square foot in area and one inch thick weighing three pounds. The wood used by the Public Works Bureau is sawn from this factory.

Brief Commentary

### The Aftermath of the Electrical Workers' Strike

The strike by the Shanghai Electric Power Company's workers has lasted for nearly a week and only came to an end yesterday afternoon, but it cannot be said to have been completely resolved. Based on various reports, we would like to offer a few suggestions regarding the aftermath of the electrical workers' strike.

This strike could have been resolved easily from the beginning if both labor and management could have accepted the government's mediation. Unfortunately, the union was controlled by a few people, and the workers' free will could not be expressed. This eventually led to a conflict between the workers' families, who were approaching the end of the year and wanted the workers to come home, and the "security team." The municipal government had no choice but to take decisive action. This shows that whether the workers' demands are justified is one thing, and how to achieve reasonable demands is another. First of all, we hope that the future Electrical Workers' Union should learn from the past and, within the legal framework, seek benefits for its members.

The Electric Power Company's willingness to mediate is commendable. However, according to the labor side, the point of contention this time was the unfairness of the seniority-based salary increase, and secondly, that some of the points previously mediated by the Social Bureau were not implemented by the management. We are not in a position to easily judge the content of the conditions, but it must be said to the management that salary increases and other matters should be fair, as slight unfairness can easily lead to disputes. Furthermore, the conditions that have been mediated and accepted should be strictly adhered to and implemented in order to eliminate strikes. Therefore, when the authorities continue to mediate in the future, the management must not think that the workers have already left the factory and can no longer pay attention to the labor's reasonable demands. They should still adhere to a legal stance and abide by the government's reasonable judgment.

Finally, we would like to say a word to the government. The municipal government's attitude this time was to mediate fairly, do its best to persuade, and take legal action to maintain order and protect freedom. All of this has been praised by Chinese and foreign citizens alike. We hope that the government will quickly transfer the few workers who coerced the strike and disrupted order to the court for trial in accordance with the law, while continuing to mediate the legitimate demands of the labor side in a fair manner. In particular, we hope for a speedy and reasonable solution so that the social community and the general workers can understand that the government is upholding the interests of workers within the legal scope.

Commercial News

### Vigorous Sales in Silver Shops; Gold Prices Reach New Peaks; Market Transactions Relatively Quiet

Yesterday, most speculators had already settled their accounts for the year, and those in the trade were not very active. As the year draws to a close, various businesses have squared their accounts, and remaining idle funds continue to be absorbed. Therefore, bullish traders disregarded the rush to sell at high prices. The effect was a sparse trading volume, with a wide gap between buying and selling prices, fluctuating rapidly. In addition, silver shops saw surprisingly strong sales, repeatedly circulating in the market to maintain inflows. Scattered buyers returned from all directions, and the market was generally flat. After opening, it briefly retreated to 1,060,000 [currency units], but silver shops then began buying, pushing it to a new high of around 1,185,000. As the US dollar failed to surpass 17 [currency units], short selling and selling from various sources caused the price to fall back below 1,100,000 by noon. Silver shops raised the price of gold jewelry to 120,000, and demand was very strong. There were still scattered price increases in the afternoon, hovering above 1,130,000 after 4 pm. Trading was extremely quiet, but still 30,000 better than the previous close. Silver shops quoted 120,000 for gold jewelry, 1,000 [currency units] for refined silver, and silver dollars slightly decreased from 630 to 650 [currency units]. (After 5 pm, silver shops raised gold prices again by 2,000, and refined silver and silver dollars also increased.) The interest rate for unsecured loans was around 1.5%, and the interest rate for New Year's funds was around 1.8%.

### Continuous Supply of Spot Goods; US Dollar Lacks Momentum to Rise

The US dollar, lacking short-covering opportunities, did not experience the same dazzling performance as gold. Furthermore, there were rumors that a new exchange rate would be announced within days, limiting the time for speculation. Without gold purchases boosting buying interest, a price decline was feared. After opening in the morning, it fell below 1,580 [currency units], but then gold prices began to soar again, pushing the short-covering price above 6,800 [currency units]. It briefly recovered to around 1,690 [currency units], but then declined again in the afternoon, following the gold market. Although gold prices rebounded in the afternoon, the US dollar failed to gain traction due to the influx of spot goods. As a result, it closed slightly lower, down by 10 [currency units]. Hong Kong currency was initially weak but then stabilized. New currency briefly fell back to 70 [currency units], but then slightly recovered, closing down by 5 [currency units] for old currency and 4 [currency units] for new currency compared to the previous day.

### Stock Transactions Few but Market Prices Rise Across the Board

At the meeting place for Chinese stocks, a small number of people continued to be active. Prices were initially low but then rose. Wing On Spinning initially fluctuated around 1,900 [currency units], and American & Chinese Spinning around 1,430 [currency units]. King Fook briefly dropped to 91 [currency units], but trading was very thin. Unpopular stocks were favored by surplus funds and remained stable, with some even being quoted higher than the previous day. For example, Wing Hing Land at 60 [currency units] and Sun Yick Land at 40 [currency units] both saw buyers searching for them, and sentiment remained positive. Securities firms were slightly active, and the afternoon ended with high and new high prices. Compared to the previous day, Wing On Spinning was up another 110 [currency units], and American & Chinese Spinning was up 50 [currency units]. The rest remained stable. The "three small" stocks saw some progress, but did not reach new highs.

Foreign stocks, stimulated by the new peak in gold prices, saw the lead of a major player, Mr. Yang, and the following of idle funds from silver and money businesses. Although foreign merchants sold at high prices, demand exceeded supply, and prices gradually rose, ending at high prices. Buying interest continued to permeate. Compared to the previous close, Ewo Spinning saw the biggest increase, up by one tenth, while the rest also rose, but not as much as Ewo Spinning. This was due to speculators concentrating on popular stocks.

### Public Bonds Continue to Rise

Most public bond dealers were resting, and a small number continued to bid higher. Class C bonds, absorbed by scattered idle funds, rose from 1,900 [currency units] to a new high of 2,050 [currency units]. At the noon close, Class A and B bonds were each up by 100 [currency units], Class C up by 140 [currency units], Class D up by 90 [currency units], and Class E up by 60 [currency units] compared to the previous close.

### Tight Spot Market for Yarn and Cloth

Yesterday, both the yarn and cotton cloth markets were closed according to custom for the Lunar New Year's Eve. However, off-market transactions saw some activity, and the market situation remained tight. Cotton transactions were still quiet, with factories making no purchases. Zhoupu seed cotton was reportedly quoted at over 10,000 [currency units].

### Tea Market Sentiment Firm

Red tea buds, favored by the Guangzhou merchants, continue to be in high demand. However, amid widespread accounting closures, sellers are generally taking a wait-and-see approach. As for chrysanthemums, the Guangzhou merchants are also accepting all offers. It is heard that they have absorbed quite a bit in recent days. Other varieties have been silent, but sentiment is quite firm.

### Dyes Report Price Increases

Various goods ordered by the merchants, such as Samsung D Grey, Great Bridge Vermilion, Five Horses Vermilion, Pagoda Superior Stomach Vermilion, and Black Indigo Powder, have all seen reported price increases of 10-20% compared to the market price. This is because after the New Year holiday, there may be shipping difficulties, and the order of cargo ships may also be restricted.

### Tea Merchant Loans

(Our Newspaper Reports) According to sources in the tea industry, the authorities are planning to consult with tea merchants about providing loans to aid tea farmers and revitalize Chinese tea exports. The amount is said to be considerable, reaching tens of millions of [currency units].

### No Formal Market for Foreign Paper; Quotations Vary

As the deadline for closing accounts for the Lunar New Year approached, the foreign paper market closed yesterday. However, a few merchants were still making scattered purchases, but most firms were dealing directly with warehouses and not making transactions, resulting in inconsistent market prices. Quotations were high for customers, but there was no formal market price. It is difficult to predict the market situation next year, as the arrival time of orders is uncertain, and spot sales have largely concluded for the year. Furthermore, rumors about foreign exchange fluctuate, affecting the paper industry particularly severely. Therefore, both rising and falling trends are possible, and both buyers and sellers are afraid to act rashly.

### Snippets

Cigarette market opened with sluggish transactions. Except for British Old Knife brand which sold very well and prices rose slightly, the rest were stable.

Industrial raw materials continued the strong momentum from the previous day due to the surge in gold prices. When the market opened yesterday morning, sentiment remained firm. Although people were settling accounts due to the approaching New Year, quotations rose again, with all goods up about 10% compared to the previous day.

Daily necessities saw sluggish transactions with very little volume due to the approaching Lunar New Year. Fixed Root scissors soap prices rose, Phoenix matches were in short supply, and candles were stable.

Cosmetics market transaction essentially ceased trading and there were few transactions. Those holding goods followed the upward trend because of the high gold prices.

### British and American Ships Arrive; Large Quantities of Coal and Kerosene

Qinhuangdao coal continued to arrive. Yesterday, the British Far East Shipping Manager's Office's British ship "Samatay" arrived from Qinhuangdao with 8,400 tons of coal, docking at Yitai Zhong Warehouse for unloading. Today, the "Wilfred Mahler" ship will also arrive from Qinhuangdao with 3,240 tons of coal, scheduled to dock at the Nanshi Beipiao Wharf for unloading.

### Factors Contributing to the Soaring Gold Prices

— (Jing Zhi)

As the year draws to a close, businesses are preparing for the New Year. Gold prices have suddenly surged, with unprecedented fervor. It is said that "if it doesn't cry, it won't, but when it does, it startles everyone." Looking at the reasons, in accordance with China's ancient customs, after a year of labor, this year-end and New Year period is given greater importance. In addition to rural visitors buying New Year goods, many exchange gold jewelry at the big banks and silver shops. Given the instability of previous currencies, although rural farmers have limited knowledge, their distrust of paper money has increased in recent years. Fake currency is converted to legal currency, but prices do not fall but rise instead, causing deep suffering among the people. Furthermore, rumors about the "Sun Ticket" [currency issued by Sun Yat-sen] are circulating. For the sake of their hard-earned savings, women, rural women visitors in particular, are seeking security in silver shops. As silver shops' sales increase, they naturally look to the market to replenish their stocks. In recent years, various commercial institutions have used gold as capital, a phenomenon that is even more prevalent among speculators. In recent times, stocks and bonds have soared, and speculators have earned several times their investment. As the settlement period arrives, profits earned, as well as funds already used, must return to their source. Stock and bond prices have risen several times, so the rise in gold prices is considered commonplace. Once there is a change, people naturally rush to buy it. Furthermore, there are rumors that there are about 7,000 short positions in the gold market. Most of these people, seeing that there was unlikely to be a drastic change in gold prices in the short term, rashly sold gold to buy active and booming stocks and bonds. Today, their profits are undeniably substantial. Logically, they should have covered their positions early. However, because gold prices remained low, or they were greedy for high interest rates, or they were addicted to stocks and bonds, they waited for an opportunity to act. Now that the speculative wave has shifted, a large number of buyers are bound to come. A short squeeze is inevitable. The above three points are the main direct reasons for the rise in gold prices. In addition, the closing price of the gold market in Chongqing has exceeded the listed selling price, raising speculation that gold savings certificates will not be paid in cash upon maturity. The "mining ticket" is pegged to legal currency at a rate of 1,000 to 1, and visitors from the rear again speculate that the "mining ticket" is pegged to the US dollar at a rate of 3 to 1, based on the pre-war legal currency status. Old events resurface, and speculation about a new exchange rate of 2,000 or 3,000 is indirectly portrayed as plausible. Gold prices in various places are much higher than in Shanghai. The authorities have only ordered customs to ban exports as a response, stimulating the public's concept of hoarding gold. With the New Year approaching, financial leaders are conveniently staying in Beijing and Shanghai at this time, and everyone believes that it is very likely that a new exchange rate will be announced during this time. The amount of legal currency on the market has recently increased considerably, and idle funds are seeking outlets. Under the doctrine of exorbitant profits, retail investors are lured by the stimulation of the "red market." All of these are indirect factors that boost gold prices. As for the rumors, they vary from person to person.

### Xikang Vocational School; Lunar New Year; Prevent Yi People from Causing Trouble

[Our Newspaper, Xichang News] The National Xikang Vocational School was established after the war in 1939. The first president was Dr. Li Shutian. Xichang, the local scenery is beautiful and rich in minerals. The school has departments of civil engineering, mining and metallurgy, machinery, chemical engineering, agriculture and forestry, animal husbandry, and medicine. All professors and students are mostly from other provinces. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, teachers and students were eager to return home to visit their families, but lacked travel expenses. The school has now been approved by the Ministry of Education to end the current semester early, so that teachers and students can return home earlier. The travel expenses for teachers returning home are fully provided by the school, but they will still return to teach. As for the students, the school also handles it in accordance with the procedures set by the Ministry. It is now nearing the Lunar New Year, and the custom of the Yi people in Xichang to "kidnap Han people as slaves" is prevalent during this period. The school was almost disturbed by the Yi people last month, but fortunately the army arrived in time, preventing a disaster. The school has taken emergency measures, including moving the families of faculty and staff to the city, and asking the local garrison to be stationed at the school to be prepared. The school previously considered moving to Leshan, Sichuan, but the plan was abandoned because the Ministry did not approve it. President Lei Zuo is still working in Chongqing and will return to school this month. (Seal)

### Sports Briefs

The Shanghai Primary and Secondary School Physical Education Teachers Research Association, initiated by Zhang Juefei, Liu Hesheng, Rong Shujian, and others, was originally planned to be established immediately, but it coincided with the school holiday period, making it difficult to proceed. Therefore, it was decided to postpone the establishment until after the schools reopen.

The famous soccer player Cao Qiuting travels frequently between Shanghai and Hankou. He happened to be in Shanghai last week, so he was able to participate in the Qingbai vs. Italian expatriates match. It was a loss for Qingbai not to see Cao's skills.

### Aspects of the Southwest Associated University (Part Two)

— Huashi

Lifestyle

The lifestyle of the Southwest Associated University (Lian Da) students mainly involved "running," "throwing," and "grabbing." The meaning and scope of the word "running" is particularly far-reaching, such as "chasing girls," "running from air raids," "running to teahouses"... Originally, life would be monotonous if one only studied, so the pursuit of the opposite sex was as intense as studying. Some say that "chasing girls" is a manifestation of the depression and decadence of youth during the war, which is not entirely reasonable. What should be specifically mentioned is that their concern for national affairs was sincere and pure, as can be seen from wartime blood donations and translator recruitment.

Due to frequent air raids, running from air raids was indeed a troublesome matter. When the bombing was most severe, they had to run five or six times a week, and each run would last all day. They had to advance or delay class times. The Lian Da was bombed twice, and the library, classrooms, and dormitories for both male and female students were hit. Mr. Hua Luogeng was once buried in the mud raised by a bomb, but fortunately he was rescued. Although Kunming has suffered terrible bombing over the years, very few teachers and friends have been killed or injured, which can be considered a great blessing. During one summer vacation, the school was bombed, and Mr. Mei personally carried an oil lamp to rush to repair it day and night, enabling classes to start as scheduled, which proves their spirit of running the school.

Speaking of "running to teahouses," every teacher and friend of Lian Da will never forget Feng　Street, a street filled with horse manure all day long. Feng　Street, what a beautiful street name. On the one hand, it shows the bankruptcy of Chinese rural areas and the poverty of Chinese farmers. On the other hand, it reflects the spirit of the academic community struggling hard through the teahouses. The ragged and thick-necked country folks drove mules and donkeys, carrying bundles of heavy pine firewood on their backs, panting as they rushed from the countryside into the city. A sack filled with dry grass or sorghum was placed on the mules' and donkeys' mouths, and they chewed as they walked. Next to the mule driver was a coarse, rough-looking bag filled with cornmeal, without a single green vegetable or a trace of salt, as black as horse grass. They chewed as they walked. We don't know whether the horses were chewing the food that people ate, or whether the people were chewing the food that horses ate. Although the Chinese people were poor, it should be lamented that the rural people of Yunnan were even poorer. However, stimulated by the lens of poverty, the teachers and friends of Lian Da, regardless of the smell of horse manure, regardless of the jingling of bells and the sounds of horses' hooves, ran to the teahouse in groups of three or five, carrying books. When happy, they would buy some peanuts to chew slowly. The landlady would make a pot of tea and put out a plate of pine nuts. At first, they were not very welcoming to those who came to the teahouse just to read books. Later, more and more people came to the teahouse to read books, and they realized that it didn't hinder their business, so they got along peacefully. I remember that Mr. Luo Wengan often went to the teahouse with law students to lecture on Roman law. Who would have known that he was a well-known figure who had traveled a long way! The German Jewish Mr. Mies, who was exiled by Hitler and familiar with the terrain and geology of western Yunnan, sometimes sat on Feng　Street for an hour or two after returning from a geological survey. Mies lived a very hard life and worked extremely hard. I wonder if the foreign scholars are still in Kunming? Maybe he has returned to the Rhine to relive his shattered homeland. "Squeezing" and "grabbing" sometimes went hand in hand. The seats in the classrooms were limited, so sometimes you had to grab them. When the library opened, hundreds of students would squeeze at the door for the first ten minutes. As soon as the door opened, they would swarm in to grab seats. There were very few required books in the reading room. As soon as the door opened, they would rush in like a tide to grab books. Those who grabbed seats couldn't grab books, and those who grabbed books couldn't grab seats. Two people had to cooperate to achieve the effect of both arms. However, female students were sometimes an exception, because many escorts had already grabbed seats for them. It is said that the atmosphere of squeezing and grabbing has improved in recent years. Otherwise, the heat generated by the low-priced rice could not withstand several runs, squeezes, and grabs.

Wartime Contributions

Although the Southwest Associated University suffered from financial difficulties for eight years, professors were hired in stages, and students were undernourished, it fulfilled its due mission, directly or indirectly, to the motherland during the eight years of bloody war. It preserved the academic freedom and style of study. If China becomes a brand-new democratic country, academic freedom can promote democracy. Before the Anti-Japanese War, the level of Yunnan was not as good as that of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Hunan provinces, the students' level was so shallow, and the people running the school were so perfunctory. During its eight years in Kunming, it cooperated with the Yunnan education authorities to run training classes to improve the quality of teachers, and some of the graduates engaged in secondary school education, injecting new blood into the poor secondary schools. Especially when recruiting new students, in the first few years, there were very few Yunnan students in the Lian Da. A historic university located in Yunnan had so few students from Yunnan, which stimulated them to catch up quickly. In this regard, the Lian Da made a special contribution to Yunnan. When the military situation in western Yunnan was tense, the teachers and students of Lian Da continued to sing and play instruments during the movement of people's hearts, which had an impact on stabilizing the rear. When the government decided to exchange professors with Britain and the United States, the professors Jin Long　, Chen Baoluo, Zhu Ruhua, Luo Xiaotian, Chen Xujing, and Rao　Tai of the Lian Da went abroad to lecture one after another, which had some power in academic cooperation. When the military urgently needed translators, the Lian Da took the lead in collective conscription, and these promising young people, entered and exited the hail of bullets, braved plagues, and fought against leeches, mosquitoes, and insects in the scorching heat and rain, using their energy and lives to deepen the relationship with the American army and accelerate the victory of the war. When the Kunming blood bank was established, the teachers and friends of the Lian Da enthusiastically donated blood. The undernourished students created the highest record of blood donation, which is indeed a good story in the Anti-Japanese War. For the sake of political rebirth and national unity, they used the highest enthusiasm, paid the greatest attention, and also exerted their greatest strength.

It has been three years since I left Kunming. I miss Kunming, I miss my alma mater. It transferred the tradition of freedom and style of study from the pre-war period to the wartime period, and then to the post-war period, from the cultural city of the north to the mountainous area of the southwest. It spent difficult years in wind and rain, and was able to flourish. It is about to become a noun on the past, but its spirit will last forever, and the people it has created will continue its consistent spirit and strive for the truth! Oh, my alma mater, my beloved alma mater! January 19, 35th year, in Chongqing

Spring and Autumn

### Theater (and Two Other Chapters)

— Jutinger

When the darkness rushed in from all directions, the streetlights were particularly bright.

Who wants to listen to the ghostly sounds of the night, the symphony of the wind? Those wandering people inadvertently strolled into the charming "Paradise," and the mournful "Hou Ting Hua" seduced its sympathizers: merchants came, families came, rickshaws came, tricycles came, cars proudly flaunted their big bellies, and 八字　also came abruptly.

Very willing to give out money, squeeze in sweating, to silver their eyes, "Good!" and also shout to break their throats.

For a long time, the neon lights told everyone to come early tomorrow. It was another big squeeze, and a clear funeral song was played quietly in the theater.

Life

Wandering, struggling... Knowing it is painful and arduous, but for the sake of life, who is willing to leave their sweet and intimate hometown, abandon the warmth, and be in a cold and desolate foreign land.

Wandering, struggling... Knowing it is painful and arduous, but for the sake of life!

How many people are like this, how many people are selling their sweat and blood, it is the pursuit of life!

Encourage! Pursuers of life, let us go to life—to understand life, to learn to fight; to improve ourselves, to create a new life!

But he is for the sake of life! Knowing it is painful and arduous, wandering, struggling...

Spring and Autumn

Where the wind rises, fallen reds scatter, where the wind rises, the twittering of birds comes; look intently, a moment is poetry, a moment is painting.

Where the wind rises, fallen leaves flutter, where the wind rises, the sound of autumn is bleak; look intently, a moment is poetry, a moment is painting.

Use a mysterious gaze, use skillful techniques, to blend it into spring and autumn.

### Going to the Market

— Song Mu

When we lived in Fishing Street, there was hardly anything new in our lives. Only the two times a week we went to the market allowed us to dig out from the quiet and monotonous days and taste a trace of lively excitement.

On the days when we went to the market, we often got up very early. We groped our way up while it was still only dimly lit. We worried that we might be late. The house was full of vitality, smiling happily, and showing an unusual radiance in spirit.

We didn't have to worry about bad weather. The days in the mountain city were always so sunny and gentle. White fog filled the fields in the quiet morning, and the strong smell of soil permeated everywhere. Dewdrops formed on the grass on the suburban paths, round and moist. Looking up, there were stars twinkling in the light gray sky.

The market was not far from where we lived. Crossing a row of dense bushes, we could see clusters of crowded heads. The market was built on a flat dam, behind which was a yellow mud wall. It was said that it was originally a private mill, but now, apart from the dilapidated mud wall, nothing could be seen. There were originally not many families living in our village. The usual days were always cold and quiet, and it was rare to see one or two people. But today, as if by a miracle, everyone came out - adults, children. They had usually seen one or two faces or had never met before, but when they bumped into each other, they would exchange a friendly smile or greet each other kindly:

"You're up early!"

The other party would then greet back cordially, raising the bamboo basket they were carrying high on their elbow, or they would deliberately want to show something to the person they were talking to, taking out a few eggs from their cloth pocket and praising them to the other party:

"The eggs at the market today are really good, big and cheap. What are you going to buy?"

Before he finished speaking, he had been crowded into the crowd by the people behind him. The already small earthen dam suddenly became more crowded with so many people. The merchants shouted loudly, and the butchers deliberately knocked the handle of their knives on the copper cans, making a clanging sound to attract customers. They did business with such friendliness. Of course, there were also disputes between them from time to time, but as soon as someone intervened, a pile of smiles would immediately appear on their faces. Look at how they were doing business:

"Boss, weigh four ounces of meat, the hindquarter."

"Okay, look, the meat was brought up from the southern countryside today, as fresh as can be."

"Just give a little leeway on the scale."

"Don't worry, I'll give you a little extra, for the sake of our old business."

Finally, the buyer took it and smiled contentedly. He said to the shopkeeper in a low voice:

"Shopkeeper, I'm short on money today, so I'll put it on credit and pay you back in two days."

The shopkeeper immediately shook his hand as if he had been humiliated:

"What are you saying? Alas, four ounces of meat is nothing. Today I'll treat you, okay?"

The country people have such a simple and honest air. The market closed very peacefully. When the sun rose high in the sky, most of the people who had gone to the market went home with their bamboo baskets full and smiling. The earthen dam slowly returned to its former tranquility. In the afternoon, when we sometimes passed by there, we only saw one or two children playing. The ground was covered with leftover vegetable peels from the morning. Other than that, it was difficult for us to imagine the bustling scene of the morning. We had to wait for a few more days in a plain and dull life. We were looking forward to the next market day, hoping it would come soon.

### Quiet

— Murong Sui

After scientists invented the principle of conservation of matter, they racked their brains in medicine, but so far there is no way to save mankind from the path of death!

The religious figures had already determined this point. They anticipated the failure of the scientists, so they exhausted their brains in religion, but achieving immortality is still like finding a needle in a haystack. They then thought of making a few more cups of sweet wine to make people walk the path of death in a daze, reducing a little of the pain of dying!

So far, there is no way to pull these poor humans out of death. Of course, they have no reason to cover up their failures!

However, the medical community is still holding on to that very thin rope, boasting of its omnipotence. In fact, that rope can only allow people to "stay a few more days" on the border of death; and the monks are still holding that cup of fine wine, boasting of their omnipotence. In fact, this cup of wine is just like "giving wine and food" to a prisoner about to be executed, just to embolden him.

We are really starting to feel a little tired! However, scientists are still gnawing on the dead man's bones of "conservation of matter"; religious figures are still drilling through the thick skin of "non-birth, non-death"!

I think this group of people gnawing on bones and drilling through thick skin should be quiet a little earlier so that those poor humans can lie down quietly.

### Flying Together (11)

— Zhao Qingge

This situation made Master Mo realize that what he had just said was not good for a child. At the same time, he was afraid that he would go and tell Madam Mo later. So he hurriedly tried to calm down and comfort Baoling, saying:

"Don't cry, child, Dad was talking nonsense just now, just joking with you, but don't tell your mother!"

"No! Dad! I understand." Baoling shook his head and sobbed. He was telling Master Mo: He understood the double meaning of Master Mo's words. Moreover, these words deeply affected his later life.

"Then, wipe away your tears obediently and go out to play!"

Baoling agreed and went out. Master Mo paced around the room for a while. At this time, he felt a little more comfortable. And he felt a little relieved by Baoling's understanding. He couldn't help but say to himself quietly: "As long as Baoling becomes successful, my life will not have been in vain!" Therefore, from then on, he regarded Baoling as his only sustenance in life, his only hope.

Mo Sheng came back with a bottle of wine and told Master Mo: Master Weng would arrive soon. Master Mo then became excited again and ordered Mo Sheng to prepare some dishes to go with the wine, as he wanted to drink with Master Weng.

Before long, Master Weng arrived.

Master Weng seemed to have just woken up, and walked into the study, yawning all the way.

"What, old brother, is the craving still not satisfied?" Master Mo greeted him and said.

"It's satisfied, but I haven't slept enough. You know, when Mo Xiong went, I was dreaming!" Master Weng said, sitting down. He shook a small white copper pipe out of his sleeve and puffed away at it.

"In that case, I've disturbed your sweet dreams! I'm really sorry!" Master Mo said, while shouting outside: "Make a pot of hot tea!"

"I heard from Mo Gan that elder brother has had a 'Joy of a Son' today, congratulations! Congratulations!" Master Weng said, spitting out clouds of smoke from his mouth, and watching with relish as the wisps of light smoke swirled and vanished.

"It's precisely for this reason that I invited you to drink together. Because there is no good wine at home, I remember the Wujiapi you had at your place the other day was very good, so I told Mo Sheng to bring it along the way. I'll ask someone to buy a few bottles in Hankou and return them to you another day," Master Mo said, feeling a little embarrassed. In fact, he didn't have the money to buy wine. Especially today, he couldn't ask his wife for money to buy wine.

"Don't mention it! If elder brother likes Wujiapi, I'll send you two more bottles later. Anyway, there are many more at home, and my alcohol tolerance is not high, so it's a pity to leave them there."

These words made Master Mo so happy that he immediately perked up! He loved wine, and wine had almost become his second life. In the past year, if wine hadn't often anesthetized him, he might not have been able to live for even a day! Wine made him forget the past; wine made him not think about the future; wine made him shamelessly continue to survive; wine saved him, and also harmed him! If someone asked him: Would you rather damage your health and die early because of wine? Or would you rather give up alcohol and stay healthy and live a few more years? He would definitely answer you without hesitation: I would rather die early because of wine than give up alcohol and live longer. Therefore, for everything else, Master Mo followed his wife's orders to change, but only "giving up alcohol" was something he firmly protested. No matter how much Madam Mo scolded, and even once smashed all the wine pots and wine cups at home, he still hugged the wine bottle and drank directly from the 酒坛子. Otherwise, he would slip out to sit in a bar. The only green jade ring he had on his hand was sold for drinking. Madam Mo never knew about this matter.

### Readers of This Newspaper Advocate for Redirecting New Year's Money to Aid Education; Changing Customs and Habits is Worth Promoting; Impoverished Students Benefit Greatly

Mr. Zhou Yixing wrote in a letter: The symphony of victory was passionately played in the streets of Shanghai not long ago. Now, we should embark on the beginning of national reconstruction. While there are many paths to national reconstruction, I believe that the New Life Movement initiated by our supreme leader Chairman Chiang should be vigorously implemented first. Our old way of life was too superficial and impractical, too cumbersome and extravagant. I believe that building the people's psychology is the foundation of building the country, and the New Life Movement is the best indicator of building the people's psychology. As the end of the lunar year approaches, the first day of the new year in the discarded calendar is imminent. During the New Year, we must exchange New Year's greetings with relatives and friends, and if we meet familiar children, we must give them New Year's money as usual. Such bad customs and habits, although they have existed for a long time, are ultimately too wasteful. Today is the era of the New Life, we must recognize reality, in other words, there is indeed a need to wash away the bad habits of the past. Because there are too many things to do in today's society, such as the student aid movement recently advocated by your newspaper, which is indeed the most urgent and practical work at hand. Two years ago, I had already stopped visiting relatives and friends for the New Year, and saved the New Year's money that should have been given, and in the past two years, I successively donated it to the Shin Pao and Sin Wen Pao student loan funds. Regarding this action, all my relatives and friends, or the children I love, forgive me and sympathize with me, which is the most pleasant thing for me. Now I still adhere to this purpose and continue to advocate, using the New Year's money I have prepared for this spring, totaling 100,000 national currency, to be dedicated to your newspaper's student aid fund. For me, it is just my way of doing things. I respectfully present my humble opinion, and I hope your newspaper will arouse compassionate voices, then I will be very fortunate.

### Student Loan Movement to Be Managed Uniformly

Since the Shanghai Municipal Education Loan Committee has cooperated with the Shin Pao and Sin Wen Pao, the city's student loan movement has been unified. Recently, it was reported that the Shanghai Student Aid Fund Federation has been organized, and famous people from all walks of life have been invited to serve as consultants to carry out the student aid movement. People from all sides have come to the association to inquire about the truth. According to the person in charge of the association, they had not contacted each other beforehand. When Tou Benri met with Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau, Director Wu also inquired about the matter and stated that the city's student loan movement should be unified, and the association's organization had not registered with the bureau beforehand.

### Service Briefs

Suggestion to Issue Round-Trip Tickets: Dear Editor: Recently, there have been few trains and many passengers on the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines, making it difficult to purchase tickets at the North Station and China Travel Service, resulting in overcrowding, theft, scams, and other sufferings that cannot be fully described. I believe that the transportation authorities should consider improving travel arrangements as soon as possible, such as issuing round-trip tickets at all stations along the line, valid for same-day use and invalid after the expiration date. Once implemented, all kinds of problems can be easily solved, achieving twice the result with half the effort. Not only will it be convenient for passengers, but the order at the stations will gradually improve. This matter concerns social welfare, so I hope you will publish it in your newspaper. Respectfully, Xu Bide from Kunshan

Ding Fubao's Calligraphy Couplets to Aid Education: Ding Fubao, a senior scholar in the academic world, has been diligent in learning throughout his life, and still practices calligraphy in his old age. However, few people outside can obtain his calligraphy. In order to promote the student aid movement, this newspaper has specially requested Mr. Ding to write 200 sets of couplets for all circles. Each set will be priced according to the usual fee for commissioned works, and after deducting the cost of paper and ink, the remainder will be used for student aid funds. Mr. Ding has always been enthusiastic about good deeds and especially likes to encourage and support younger generations, but he usually does not write calligraphy for money. Now he has made an exception to generously agree to benefit students, which is not a small matter. Mr. Ding's calligraphy is strong and profound, and in recent years it has become even more vigorous and ancient. Those who admire his calligraphy can obtain his work and also contribute to charity. The number is limited, so please do not miss the opportunity.

Fee - 5,000 yuan per couplet (limited to five-foot couplets, no point-style or rhyme-matching) Order at the Social Service Office of this newspaper
