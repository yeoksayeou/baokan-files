[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 25th] The National Assembly, inaugurated on November 15th, has lasted for 40 days. Apart from the preparatory meetings and review sessions, the assembly has convened 20 times. The draft constitution has completed its one-one-three procedure. This constitution, possessing unique characteristics and democracy, was finally born in an atmosphere of harmony among various parties and factions. The 25th is a historical commemorative day, and the assembly completed its mission today. The closing ceremony was held at 3:40 PM. All representatives of the National Assembly and envoys from various countries attended.

Wu entered from the side door of the chairman's office, followed by Chairman Chiang. Wu wore a blue gown and a black vest, with a bald head and white hair. Chairman Chiang wore a military uniform, collar badges, and the Order of Blue Sky and White Sun. Amidst the music, they jointly ascended the stage. Wu sat on the left, and Chairman Chiang, in his capacity as Chairman of the National Government, sat on the right. After the ceremony began and formalities were observed, Wu delivered an impromptu speech.

After the speech, Secretary-General Hong read the National Assembly's message to the Chairman of the National Government. (See separate article for the original text). The assembly then held a presentation ceremony.

### Chairman Accepts the Constitution and Addresses the Assembly

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] Chairman Chiang of the National Government addressed the closing ceremony of the National Assembly on the 25th. The original text is as follows: "Today, the National Assembly has enacted the Constitution of the Republic of China and resolved the date of implementation and preparatory procedures for the Constitution. On behalf of the National Government, Zhongzheng respectfully accepts it. As Chairman Wu has just said, the enactment of this Constitution is enough to comfort the martyrs who sacrificed themselves under the leadership of our Founding Father for 52 years and the heroic spirits of the soldiers and civilians who died in the War of Resistance. The National Government will certainly follow the procedures decided by the Assembly and implement them one by one. I deeply hope that all of our representatives will assist the National Government and lead the people of the whole country to jointly uphold this Constitution and implement this Constitution, so that our China will become a new China of the Three Principles of the People, of the people, by the people, and for the people. From today onwards, the National Government will fulfill its long-cherished wish to return power to the people, and you, the representatives, have created the foundation for constitutional governance in China. This is indeed worthy of celebration by all compatriots in the country. On behalf of the government, Zhongzheng congratulates the success of the Assembly and wishes all representatives and all compatriots in the country good health and happiness."

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] The National Assembly's message to the government on the presentation of the Constitution is as follows: "On the 28th of November, at the third plenary session, Chairman Chiang personally presented the draft amendment to the Constitution of the Republic of China to the assembly, which was accepted by the assembly. Subsequently, the assembly continued to hold meetings, referring the original draft and the amendments proposed by the attending representatives to the various review committees for review. The review results were then submitted to the assembly, adopted separately, and in accordance with the rules of procedure of the assembly, a total of 20 sessions were held, completing the procedures of one, two, and three readings, passing all the amendments, and deciding on the preparatory procedures for the implementation of the Constitution, confirming the date of promulgation, and resolving that the Constitution of the Republic of China shall be implemented on December 25, 1947. We now respectfully present the original copy of the Constitution of the Republic of China and the preparatory procedures for the implementation of the Constitution to the government, to be promulgated in due course and implemented upon its expiry. This assembly is awed by this extraordinary undertaking and cannot express enough our sincere expectations. Respectfully to Chiang, Chairman of the National Government."

[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 25th] The presidium of the National Assembly will hold its final meeting in one or two days to conclude all matters.

### Closing Remarks by Mr. Wu Jingheng

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] During the closing ceremony of the National Assembly, Chairman Wu Jingheng delivered a speech, the full text of which is as follows: "Distinguished representatives, when this assembly convened, I said that it was the most memorable and joyous day for our Republic of China, because convening the National Assembly was the most hoped-for thing that our Founding Father never forgot. With the convening of the National Assembly, a complete constitution of the Republic of China will surely be created, and the political power of the Republic of China he built will be handed over to the Chinese people. Based on a complete constitution, the Republic of China can be permanently successful as a prosperous, strong, and happy country in the world. Sure enough, as soon as the meeting began, the Chairman of the National Government handed over a carefully considered and perfect draft constitution to the assembly. The representatives of this assembly carefully discussed it for more than a month and created a very progressive constitution, successfully completing a Republic of the people, by the people, and for the people, based on the Three Principles of the People, and becoming the newest constitution of the republic in the world. The spirit of the Founding Father in heaven must be very happy. The Founding Father contributed his Three Principles of the People to his compatriots, asking his compatriots to lay the foundation and create the most complete and democratic constitution, and he has achieved his aspirations. He greatly agreed with Confucius's principle of 'yielding as a way to govern the country,' and also agreed with Lao Tzu's principle of 'leading without dominating.' He could immediately yield to others after serving as the provisional president and acted without possessing. He had the best doctrine and did not favor his own party. He wrote the Outline of National Reconstruction early on, longing to convene the National Assembly and return power to the people. Therefore, the representatives of this assembly also unanimously respected the Founding Father's actions and were able to fully adhere to the principle of yielding. In terms of etiquette, discussions were never ambiguous, and even loud arguments were made, but in terms of yielding, once a majority decision was made, everyone immediately calmed down and did not argue. This is exactly the same as the most progressive parliamentary representatives in various countries, so they were able to create the most complete and democratic new constitution of the Republic of China today. Now, this first assembly can serve as a model for future assemblies. Failing to achieve one's personal opinion is a small matter, but setting an example is a big matter. Therefore, we can admire the magnanimity of the representatives this time. Now, we hand over this constitution to the Chairman of the National Government and ask him to choose an auspicious day to promulgate it and legally hand it over to the elected government for implementation, so that our Republic of China will forever become a strong and happy country in the world. Today, our representatives dare not claim old age. We are honored to have attended this meeting. We thank the entire nation for supporting the assembly, which has enabled it to succeed. We take this opportunity to wish our 450 million compatriots health, peace, happiness, and longevity."

### The Ministry of Information Hosts a Press Conference; Mr. Wang Chonghui Discusses the Constitution

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] The Ministry of Information held a press conference at 12:00 noon on the 25th. Dr. Wang Chonghui gave an impromptu written speech on the key points of the constitution, stating: "The constitution enacted by the National Assembly has been prepared for more than ten years. After the promulgation of the May 5th Draft Constitution, the work of constitutionalism had to be delayed until after the victory due to the urgency of the War of Resistance. At the beginning of this year, the Political Consultative Conference was held, and representatives from various parties and social figures participated. Several articles of the amendment principles of the May 5th Draft Constitution were agreed upon. The draft constitution submitted by the government to the National Assembly this time was revised based on the amendment principles of the Political Consultative Conference. Although the National Assembly has made additions and deletions, the key points agreed upon by the Political Consultative Conference have all been included in the constitution."

### The Kuomintang Will Hold a Party Group Review Meeting

[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 25th] Because party workers from various provinces came to Nanjing to attend the National Assembly, and now that the assembly has closed, the Kuomintang has decided to convene a party group review meeting immediately, scheduled to be held on the 27th for two days. It is reported that in addition to reviewing party work, there will also be discussions on party work after the announcement of the new constitution.

### The Third Reading of the Draft Constitution Has Been Completed; A Minority of Representatives Still Oppose Officials Serving as National Assembly Representatives; Peace Was Restored After Chairman Chiang's Instructions

[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 25th] The 20th meeting of the National Assembly was held at 10:00 AM on the 25th, with 1,485 representatives including Chiang Kai-shek attending. At the opening of the meeting, there were 1,376 people present. Chairman Yu Youren reported, and after the rapporteur read the minutes of the 19th meeting, Hu Shi stepped onto the podium amidst hissing to report on the work of the drafting committee for the amendment to the draft constitution. After Hu's speech, he stepped down amidst hissing. The third reading began at 10:20 AM. Chairman Yu passed it item by item amidst applause from the audience. Regarding the provisions of Article 26 on the election of representatives to the National Assembly, a representative raised the issue of the election of free professional groups. Deputy Secretary-General Lei replied that the "professional groups" in item 6 of that article included free professional groups, and the Comprehensive Review Committee had a record of this. As for Article 28, the question of whether officials could be elected as representatives to the National Assembly caused a great uproar. As soon as Chairman Yu finished reading that item, Ni Bi vehemently stated on the upper floor: "This provision violates democratic principles and cannot be passed. We cannot be traitors to the Founding Father, and we cannot be sinners for all generations." Those who responded rose up and shouted, "Down with corrupt officials!" "Down with bureaucracy!" and demanded a vote. Yu ignored them and continued to read the following articles, which caused great chaos. People accused the chairman of violating the law and demanded that the article be put to a vote. Yu said that the third reading only amended the text and could not change the principles. The crowd roared! "According to Article 12 of the National Assembly Organization Law, the quorum for the constitutional convention requires the approval of three-quarters of the attending representatives, otherwise it cannot be counted." Yu then consulted with Secretaries-General Hong and Lei, and Lei read Articles 37 and 38 of the rules of procedure, stating: "The third reading may only make textual corrections, and no amendments may be made unless it is discovered that the proposals are mutually contradictory. Moreover, the third reading only resolves the proposal as a whole, and no changes can be made to its acceptability." Some of the crowd applauded in support, but those who opposed it still refused to accept it, shouting, "We don't want to make changes, we only ask for a vote according to the law. The constitutional convention is not a child's play, down with bureaucracy!" For a time, the situation became deadlocked.

At 10:40 AM, Representative Chiang Kai-shek, wearing a green military uniform, stepped onto the podium and said: "Representatives, you are here to represent the people of the whole country, and you should abide by the rules of the meeting and set an example for the people of the whole country. The relevant provisions of the rules of procedure have already been announced and explained clearly by the Secretary-General. We must carry out the third reading in an orderly manner." After Chiang's speech, he stepped down and sat down amidst great applause. But three or four representatives still shouted: "Please vote according to the law!" Chiang then stepped onto the podium again and said: "If you representatives continue to demand a vote and a result that violates the rules of procedure occurs, you will be responsible." A surge of anger began to subside. The work of reading the constitution continued. At 10:45 AM, Deputy Secretary-General Lei, on behalf of Chairman Yu, continued to read from Chapter 5. Except that it was stated in Article 64 that paragraph 6 of the provisions for the election of legislators, "professional groups" included free professional groups, and the Comprehensive Review Committee had a record of this, and that the text of Articles "78," "108," "111," and "146" proposed by the representatives was revised and handed over to the group for organization, all were read smoothly. At 11:37 AM, Article 175 was read three times, and the audience applauded for a minute.

Then Hu Shi reported again amidst hissing. Shi Jian's group organized the results; after Hu's speech, he stepped down amidst hissing. Deputy Secretary Book reported that the last item of Article 174, paragraph 1, was "and the resolution of three-quarters of the attending representatives," the word "37" was misprinted, and the word "resolution" in Article 70 was maintained as the original "proposal" after being questioned by the audience. At 11:45 AM, Chairman Yu said, "Those who agree with the Constitution of the Republic of China please stand up." Everyone stood up silently. The bright mercury lamps shone down, and the camera whirred loudly. All the representatives applauded and cheered and sat down. Shortly afterward, Deputy Secretary-General announced: "All 1,485 representatives present stood up and agreed. The full text of the Constitution has been passed." Then began the discussion of the date of implementation of the constitution. With an absolute majority of 1,054 votes, it was passed: "December 25, 1947, is the date of implementation." Deputy Secretary-General Lei reported the voting results and stated: "The chairman will open the meeting after a few sessions. The closing ceremony will be held in the afternoon. The secretariat will provide written notice of other matters." Then the meeting adjourned at 11:55 AM, and this last meeting came to an end.

### The Democratic Socialist Party Issues a Statement

[This City News] The Chinese Democratic Socialist Party issued a statement on the 24th, stating: "On the 24th of this month, our party received a letter from the Democratic League regarding our party's withdrawal from the league. We hereby issue a public statement as follows:

On August 29th of this year, our party sent a letter to the Democratic League, requesting that 'all important statements of the Democratic League must obtain the prior consent of our party.' Logically, this letter does not include that all important actions of our party must obtain the prior consent of the Democratic League. The Democratic League is a broad union striving for democracy in response to the needs of the times. Our party was originally one of the initiators. Since merging with the overseas Democratic Constitutional Party and reorganizing as the Democratic Socialist Party, in order to express our party's position, there was a statement to the Democratic League on August 29th. This time, we participated in the National Assembly in order to complete the constitution, so we hope that constitutionalism will replace tutelage, which is a step forward compared to stagnation at the stage of autocracy. Our party has no military force and no territory. How can we ignore the path to democracy? Our party colleagues were moved by the voices of the vast majority of people who have been reduced to bankruptcy and suffered from the ravages of war, and we asked ourselves if we were guilty. Now we have received a letter from the Democratic League stating: 'It is difficult to continue cooperation within the league.' Our party has its own doctrine and its own political program. Rather than causing disputes due to entanglement, it is better to be independent of each other. As for the advocacy of striving for peace, realizing democracy, and nationalizing the army, our colleagues have already raised it first, and we will strive to implement it afterward. All those who share the same goals with our party can cooperate. As for party members who participate in the Democratic League, in this situation, our party will handle it in accordance with our party's constitution."

### Soviet Union Does Not Violate Law in Dalian Incident; US State Department Temporarily Does Not Interfere; However, New York Opinion Circles Still Attach Great Importance

[United Press, Washington, 24th] State Department press officer Mr. Hite replied to reporters' questions today, stating: The Soviet military authorities in Dalian ordered a US Navy vessel to leave Dalian last Friday after staying in the port for 48 hours, which is a legal action. The Soviet authorities have the right to refuse a US merchant, a journalist, and a photographer on board to disembark. These two people had not obtained formal Soviet permission in advance. US diplomats reported that the facts reported by US journalist Newton were very accurate. However, it has not yet been definitively proven that the Soviet military authorities verbally issued an ultimatum to the US vessel, ordering it to leave the port within twenty minutes, or they would not be responsible. Based on the preliminary reports it has received, the State Department is currently taking a non-interventionist approach, but this is not a final decision. The vessel was carrying supplies and diplomatic mail to the US Consulate General in Dalian, and had notified the Soviet authorities in accordance with custom. It was permitted to stay in the port for 48 hours to fulfill its official mission without hindrance. However, the two journalists and one merchant on board had not applied for entry. During the ship's stay in port, the US Consul General attempted to invite them to enter, but the Soviet authorities in Dalian said that they had no power to allow them to enter without permission from Moscow. The vessel left Dalian two hours after exceeding the original 48-hour berthing period. According to the Sino-Soviet Treaty of August last year, Dalian is a free commercial port under Chinese administration. However, the Chinese and Soviet governments have not yet agreed on the procedures for takeover. Therefore, Dalian is still under Soviet military administration. The US government hopes that it can agree on the transfer of administration as soon as possible, but recognizes that this matter should be handled by the two governments.

[United Press, Nanjing, 25th] A Chinese government spokesman refused to comment yesterday on the incident in which a US Navy vessel was expelled from Dalian by the Soviet authorities. Official sources said today: This is not surprising, because although the Sino-Soviet Treaty stipulates that both sides jointly manage Dalian, Chinese naval vessels cannot enter Dalian.

[Central News Agency, New York, 24th] Regarding the expulsion of a US warship by the Soviet military in Dalian, the newspapers in New York still paid great attention to it today, and the newspapers still published it in a prominent position on the front page. A late dispatch written by Newton, a reporter for the Scripps-Howard newspaper group, for the United Press, has so far only been commented on by the New York Times. The New York Times used a column and a half of space and four lines of headlines to publish the news as the most important news of the day, and attached a map with the headline stating: "The Soviet military issued an ultimatum to the US warship, forcing it to leave Dalian, and warned that if it did not leave within twenty minutes, there would be a dangerous consequence." Reporters and oil merchants were all prohibited from disembarking. The Republican former forum newspaper did not criticize it, but only published it on the front page with a four-line headline saying: "Soviet troops force US warship to leave Dalian. The US warship made a routine visit to Dalian this time, but was ordered to leave within twenty minutes. Two reporters and one US merchant were all prohibited from disembarking." Other newspapers also published the news in a prominent position and with large headlines.

### What a US Reporter Saw: Dalian Behind the Iron Curtain

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] United Press, according to a dispatch from Dalian on the 20th by Newton, a special reporter for the Scripps-Howard newspaper group representing the world's press: (delayed) The Soviet Union obviously maintains its complete control over Dalian, the "gateway to the Northeast," and will continue to station troops there until a peace treaty with Japan is signed. This will be seen in the facts under the technical interpretation of the section on Dalian in the Sino-Soviet Treaty. According to this section: "Dalian is not included in the effective scope of the naval base provisions determined by the agreement on Lushun on August 14, 1945 in peacetime, but only comes under the military supervision or control of this area during the war against Japan." The crux lies in the words "in peacetime". Before the signing of a peace treaty with Japan, China and the Soviet Union are still technically at war with Japan. Although the two US reporters who went to Dalian on the former US Navy patrol ship were rejected from Dalian by Lieutenant General Gao Chaynov, commander of the Soviet military in Dalian, the general situation in Dalian under Soviet rule can still be learned from neutral and Chinese sources: a city full of melancholy and coldness. Under the Soviet Iron Curtain, it is subject to many restrictions, and the only currency in circulation in the city is Soviet military bills. Industry is paralyzed, hunger and unemployment are widespread, and prices are exorbitant. Only three buildings in the city have heating facilities to resist the severe cold of the Northeast. The Russian and Chinese civilians who have always lived in Dalian are falling into a deep abyss of poverty and fear. No one dares to approach Americans who are constantly under Soviet surveillance. The people have little chance to escape the arrest and punishment of the Soviet military authorities, let alone freedom of speech or the press. According to reliable sources, a certain Chinese newspaper there can only be published occasionally when its Communist publisher "thinks of some anti-American remarks". There are daily reports of the Soviet military mistreating Chinese and White Russian residents. Many young Chinese students have been arrested by the Soviets for harboring the idea that "the rights of Dalian must be restored to China". Propaganda pictures such as portraits of Stalin or other prominent Soviet figures can be seen everywhere in the city; in addition, there are slogans such as "Peace and prosperity can only be hoped for after the Americans are driven out" to the local hungry and unemployed Chinese residents. However, the Soviet military fully uses American lend-lease materials, such as ships, airplanes, automobiles, and other materials. The only Red Army transport ship seen in Dalian was built by the United States. The atmosphere of fear in Dalian is not limited to Chinese residents, but even the Soviets are not exempt. The actions of local Soviet officials are controlled by Moscow, and Soviet military or diplomatic representatives also live in terror. These people must be careful not to overstep the scope indicated by the Kremlin. Observers believe that it was this fear that prompted Gao Chaynov, commander of the Soviet military in Dalian, to issue an ultimatum to the US patrol ship (leave the port within twenty minutes, otherwise we will not be responsible for the consequences).

### Regulating Military Life

The Ministry of National Defense Plans to Establish Army, Navy, and Air Force Joint Clubs in Major Cities

### Rumor Has It That There Is a New Compromise Between China and the Soviet Union; A New Treaty Will Be Signed to Supplement the Treaty of Friendship; After Signing, We Can Receive Lushun and Dalian

[This newspaper, Shenyang, 25th] The National Army pointing to Dalian is still stationed in the area of Pulandian and Tangfangtun without taking any action. The Communist troops have retreated to a more distant place. There are still a few Soviet troops at the Nan Shihe Railway Station in Pulandian. According to a certain military official, the Soviet troops in the area and the National Army near Shihe in the southwest of Pulandian have contact with each other, and the relationship between the two sides is quite harmonious. It is also rumored that there is a new compromise between China and the Soviet Union on Lushun and Dalian. A new treaty of a supplementary nature to the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship will be signed, or it will be a commercial treaty, which is generally quite satisfactory. After the signing, our administrative personnel can go to Lushun and Dalian to receive it, which may not be far away.

### Many Difficulties in Blocking the Yellow River; 50,000 Cubic Meters of Stone Still Needed Urgently; Inspection Team of the Blocking and Restoration Bureau Was Shot at by Communist Troops

[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 25th] The most difficult part of the Huayuankou project has been thrown into the water, and the entire project is expected to be completed before the Lingfan flood season. However, there is still a shortage of 50,000 cubic meters of stone needed for the project, which must be transported to the construction site before January 15 next year. Given the current situation of stone transportation on the Pinghan and Jinpu railways, if strict limits are not imposed on rushing to transport the stone on schedule and in the required quantity, it may be difficult to transport enough by then. If that happens, the bridges will be in danger during the Lingfan flood season, and all previous efforts will be in vain. The Yellow River Blocking and Restoration Engineering Bureau has sent telegrams to all parties to appeal. In addition, Zhao Shouyu, chairman of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, went to the Huayuankou construction site yesterday to inspect. The Huayuankou Blocking and Restoration Bureau plans to block the gate recently to restore the water flow to its old course. At the same time, in order to avoid danger downstream, Qi Shouan, deputy director of the bureau, Men Zhenxing, director of the engineering department, and Consultant Tadde, together with Zhao Mingfu, the representative of the CCP stationed in Bian, went to the CCP area in Shandong on the 16th to investigate the dike restoration project. However, due to various obstacles, they had to return halfway and arrived in Zhengzhou on the 22nd. According to Zhu Guangcai, director of the bureau, Qi, the deputy director, and others set off on the 16th and were shot at more than a hundred times by the Communist troops when they arrived at Heze Linpuji, but they took the risk and broke through safely. On the 17th, they went to Lijinshiting and were shot at by Communist troops again when they passed Qiantong. The next day, they continued to advance to Zhangqiuzhen, which belongs to Shouzhang County. Halfway there, the Communist troops attacked again. At that time, the car Zhao Mingfu, the CCP representative, was riding in was far behind. When he rushed forward, the gunfire stopped. Later, they arrived at Zhangqiuzhen, which is the seat of the Communist troops' Jiluyu Border Region Administrative Office, and then held discussions. The Communist side immediately put forward three points: (1) The date of the Huayuankou blockade had not been agreed upon by the Communist side; (2) 15 billion yuan in relief funds had not been fully received; (3) They were dissatisfied with the distribution of relief supplies, and said: If all the bad consequences are caused by these three points, the other party (referring to the government) will be responsible. Finally, they threatened that there were no troops stationed in the area south of Jinan and north of Zhangqiu, and safety could not be guaranteed. Qi and others had no choice but to return.

### Letter from US Reporter to Soviet Military Commander

[United Press, Dalian, 20th] (Delayed) Two US reporters who were refused to disembark in Dalian sent a letter to Gao Chaynov, the Soviet military commander in Dalian, questioning him. The letter stated: "We request to enjoy the treatment and rights enjoyed by Soviet journalists in overseas US-occupied areas and the treatment and rights enjoyed by journalists from various countries in areas under the jurisdiction of the Chinese government. We dare not believe that Soviet officials in Dalian want to hide anything to deceive people's eyes and ears. Dalian is a good port in the Far East, and all countries in the world are paying close attention to it. According to our observations, we know that your country is still using American Liberty-type transport ships in the port of Dalian, and your country's army is riding and using American Jeeps. American airplanes are also landing and taking off at the nearby Soviet airport. Since this equipment was given to your country by the US government during the war, we believe that it is not unreasonable to want to see how your country uses this material after the war." However, Gao Chaynov did not reply to the letter.

### Communist Army Launches Offensive in North China; Fierce Fighting Begins in Suburbs of Baoding; Intensified Suppression Decided Due to Unrest Around Beiping

[This newspaper's Tianjin dispatch, 25th] According to reliable information, the Communist army has decided to launch a full-scale offensive in North China in response to the successful conclusion of the National Assembly. Frequent troop movements of the Communist army have been heard everywhere, and the flames of war will soon spread to all areas. Relevant parties have stated that the National Army is well prepared and that this conspiracy of the Communist army may be quickly contained.

[This newspaper's Beiping dispatch, 25th] After suffering setbacks northwest of Baoding, the Communist army's momentum has not diminished. The National Army, ten li away from Mancheng, has withdrawn to twenty li west of Baoding. However, as long as Mancheng remains in the hands of the Communist army, Baoding will remain uneasy, so the city will continue to be contested by the two armies. Yujiazhuang, Fangshunqiao, and even Wangdu in the south of Baoding are again under the control of the Communist army, but the National Army in Wangdu is still awaiting supplies from Baoding, so large armies with supplies are passing through this area. The Pingbao section has been tested today, and the situation is still good, but the Communist army has already gathered a large army on both sides of the railway between Caohe and Xushui, so future traffic will still be difficult. More than 10,000 Communist troops, mixed with militiamen, have also arrived west of Zhuoxian County. The Communist army's reassembly of heavy troops in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway seems to be due to the National Army's weak forces.

[Central News Agency, Baoding dispatch, 25th] The 8th Field Brigade of the Communist army and the 70th and 82nd Regiments of Meng Qingba's unit launched a fierce attack on the northern and southern Da Ran, eastern and western Shiqiao, fifteen li outside Baoding, and Gong Di, thirty li south of the city, at 2 a.m. on the 24th, and fierce fighting is still ongoing as of the morning of the 25th. Furthermore, the 11th Field Brigade of the Communist army fled from Mancheng to the Yaocun area north of Caohe and shelled the National Army between Xushui and Caohetou on the morning of the 24th.

[This newspaper's Beiping dispatch, 25th] There is unrest around Beiping. Lu Di on the Sunhe bank in Beiyuan was captured by more than 1,000 Communist troops again last night, and the military has dispatched troops to block them. A thousand Communist troops arrived at Yipianshi in the western mountains yesterday. After the recapture of Panggezhuang and Lixianzhen south of Beiping, small groups of Communist troops have been active in the vicinity yesterday and today. The Beiping Garrison Command convened a meeting of all parties yesterday to discuss measures, deciding to divide the surrounding suburbs of Beiping into five security zones, each responsible for by the nearby garrison, and at the same time, the Beiping Pacification Zone will intensify pacification work.

[This newspaper's Beiping dispatch, 25th] The National Army's mopping-up operation in the eastern region of the Jidong-Ninglu Road has been completed. More than 4,000 Communist troops have disintegrated and escaped in the gaps of the National Army's absolutely superior fan-shaped position advancing towards the coast. Some have fled west of the road. The Bohai River bank area of eastern Hebei, which has long been controlled by the Communist army, is now under the protection of the National Army.

### Communist Army Repeatedly Attacks Without Success; Situation in Liaocheng, Shandong, Stabilizes; Military and Civilians Endure Hardship and Resist, Turning Danger into Safety

[This newspaper's Jinan dispatch, 24th] Liaocheng, the most prominent stronghold outside Jinan, has recently been fiercely besieged by the Communist army. The city used to be the Dongchangfu city, where the Tuhai River and the Grand Canal meet, forming the city's natural moat. The National Army has been trapped and defended for years, and the Communist army has not been able to take it. Since the 20th of this month, the Communist army has again taken advantage of the cold weather and frozen water, gathered elite troops, and launched multiple artillery pieces, launching a fierce attack on the city for three days and nights, first coercing the people. Cloud ladders were widely placed, and they climbed the city on water more than ten times. Under the leadership of Commissioner Wang Jinxiang, the military and civilians in the city bravely resisted, and the city was safe. Until the evening of the 23rd, the Communist army still concentrated its artillery fire on the east gate, constantly bombarding it. At 10 o'clock, more than a zhang was destroyed, and there were two breaches. The Communist army swarmed forward, and the National Army was bravely resisting with human bombs. A cry for help echoed throughout the city, increasing with the city's danger.

[This newspaper's Jinan dispatch, 25th] Starting last night, the Communist army besieging Liaocheng continued to attack the city wall under the cover of three mortars and one field gun. Under thorough cooperation, tens of thousands of soldiers and civilians in the city braved the rain of bullets to repair the breach in the east gate and repelled the Communist army in one fell swoop. It snowed heavily all day on the 25th, and the situation has stabilized slightly.

### Communist Army Retreats from Suqian Perimeter; National Army Recaptures Yaowan

[This newspaper's Xuzhou dispatch, 25th] More than 50,000 Communist troops have been fiercely attacking the outer perimeter of Suqian and the vicinity of Zahe Yaowan in separate routes for several days, but they began to retreat on the 24th.

[This newspaper's Zhenjiang dispatch, 25th] (1) The recapture of Yaowan has been confirmed. The National Army is clearing the remaining Communist troops in the Pisu Sui territory south of Longhai. It is reported that there are still three regiments of Communist troops in Guanyun County, but their fighting spirit has been lost. (2) The Communist army in Funing is suffering from severe internal strife and is unable to fight, and there are signs of retreat. It is possible that Funing will see the light of day again within the Gregorian calendar year.

Editorial

### Completion of the Constitutional Nation-Building Task

The National Assembly, convened specifically to draft the Constitution of the Republic of China, passed all drafts of the Constitution yesterday, declaring its closure. This grand constitutional nation-building task has been completed, an unprecedented event in the history of our nation. Now that the Constitution of the Republic of China has been formulated, the implementation of the Constitution has also been clearly defined, and the National Assembly has determined that the effective date of the Constitution is December 25th of next year before its closure, so there is a fixed date for the beginning of constitutional government, which is really comforting to the general public. All people in the country are deeply inspired by the hard work of the representatives to the National Assembly over the past forty days. Now, as the National Assembly closes and the Constitution of the Republic of China is formulated, we express the general gratitude of the Chinese people to the representatives.

The formulation of this Constitution is a manifestation of the public opinion of the Chinese people. The representatives to the National Assembly come from all walks of life across the country, representing the best cross-section of national public opinion. The Constitution passed with the efforts of over 1,400 representatives over 41 days, with heated debates and repeated deliberations. Therefore, the Constitution passed this time is a feasible national law that has exhausted wisdom and consideration. The political system and other provisions stipulated in this document accommodate the opinions of all parties and are especially able to express the spirit of neutrality and harmony, which has set an eternal shining example for the National Assembly that drafted this Constitution. A country's constitution is the fundamental law of the country. When it is formulated, it must take into account the opinions of all parties and be recognized by all parties. It must be recognized by all parties before it can become the national law. This was the case with the drafting of the US Federal Constitution in the past. The situation was also the same during the drafting of the constitution in France after the war. The formulation of our country's constitution this time follows the established practices of the advanced democratic countries of the United States and France, laying the foundation for our country's democratic politics. This is a watershed moment in Chinese politics.

Speaking of drafting the constitution, the constitution itself is not only a number of articles, but a living and vibrant creation. The formulation of the constitution can only be said to be the birth of the constitution, like a newborn baby, it still needs to develop and grow up. The birth of a baby is painful, and life is produced in pain, but even more difficult than birth is the subsequent upbringing to adulthood. Now that the Constitution has been born, we should pay more attention to nurturing this baby that was born out of pain. The birth of our country's constitution coincides with Christmas, which does not seem to be just a coincidence. Jesus is the savior of mankind, and this Chinese constitution, born out of pain, should at least be able to save our China in the same way. Christmas is also our National Renaissance Day. The Constitution of the Republic of China formulated by the National Assembly this time was completed on this day, which is truly a symbol of the revival of the Chinese nation. May all the people of the country cherish our Constitution and make the country prosperous and peaceful from now on!

### Gold Rush

As a result of the Central Bank's continued sale of gold in recent days, gold prices have finally plummeted. In two days, it fell from the four million yuan mark to three million two hundred thousand yuan, a difference of about eight hundred thousand yuan. Other US dollars, stocks, cigarettes, gauze, silk and satin, etc. have therefore fallen in turn. Several small-scale silver shops, money houses, and banks, caught off guard, even experienced turmoil, with interest rates rising to more than two corners, and the market was filled with panic and fear. From this point, we can get proof of the following facts.

(1) The Central Bank does have the ability to influence gold market prices.

(2) The rise and fall of gold prices are indeed related to commodity prices, especially stimulating to speculative goods.

(3) There are indeed many financial, securities, and general merchants engaged in speculative business.

(4) The foundations of some small-scale financial institutions are particularly unstable.

(5) Tightening of credit affects interbank lending rates.

(6) The tightening or loosening of credit is indeed controlled by the Central Bank.

Because there is a series of the above facts, which are interconnected, we are reminded of the following three things.

Since the rise and fall of gold prices have such a broad impact, and the Central Bank does have the ability to control them, should the bank maintain a certain level of gold prices at all times? In other words: Is it wise to let it soar to a considerable height, and then use great pressure to force it down? If we had sold off in large quantities earlier, so that it would not have risen to a height of four million yuan, and therefore the range of fluctuations in finance and commodity prices could be reduced somewhat, would it be beneficial to general industry and commerce, and the general public? These questions seem worth studying. This is the first.

The Central Bank clearly has supreme authority over credit and interest rates. Just a small test of its skills in gold policy has been enough to make the entire market stormy and out of control. Then, the problem of high interest rates and difficulties in turnover, which is generally painful and heartbreaking, seems easy for the Central Bank to grasp the direction and give appropriate solutions. That is to say: there is a way to solve the problems that industry and commerce are now worried about. The only key point is what the views of the financial and fiscal authorities are. This is the second.

Although there have been many previous announcements about preventing speculation and strictly prohibiting manipulation, etc. But from the market situation in the past few days, it is clear that there are still many merchants and financiers who are still immersed in it, forgetting to return. How should we effectively control and guide it onto the right track in the future? In particular, for those engaged in financial business, how can we make them learn from the past, know how to repent, so as to avoid affecting the entire market, this is indeed a problem that deserves attention. This is the third.

The Gregorian New Year is just around the corner, and the Lunar New Year is not far away. At this time when the crisis in industry and commerce is very serious, everyone is working diligently and steadily, and they are still afraid of unexpected disturbances that cannot be avoided. Looking at the situation in the past few days, it seems that people are still sound asleep, and there are too many places where personnel, management, and operations are not sound. I hope everyone will pay special attention.

### Massive Embezzlement in Jiangyin's Grain Collection; Over 10 Billion Embezzled Through Private Rice Banks; Reported in the Assembly; Urgent Telegram Sent to the Provincial Field and Grain Office for Instructions

[This newspaper's Jiangyin report] Since the implementation of the grain collection system in the county, there have been many abuses. On the fourth day (23rd) of the Provincial Assembly, it caused heated debates. Hong Qishen, Deputy Director of the Provincial Grain Office, came to supervise and expedite grain collection and also attended the meeting to explain, hoping that the assembly members would report as much as possible on the embezzlement of grain collection. (1) The military grain purchased in kind totaled 13,653 shi. More than 50 million yuan of military grain funds are still in the county government. Have the villagers received it? (2) The standard for the amount of rice collected is 108 catties. Legally, it is illegal to collect more than one catty. Private establishment of Xinyi Rice Banks was reported to the provincial office long ago and is absolutely illegal. No other counties have this situation and must be closed down. The Field and Grain Office will never accept rice bank funds and hopes for reports. Assembly member Zou Zongyi then spoke, strongly exposing the facts. Jiangyin has 21 branches of Xinyi Rice Banks, which have not been permitted by the government, and have arbitrarily collected rice funds. Based on the county's tax quota, more than half has been collected. 4,000 yuan more is collected per dan, totaling 108 million yuan, which goes into private pockets. Even if calculated at a 30% discount, there is a staggering amount of 30 million yuan. The grain loan embezzlement in Shanghai was only 10 million yuan, which has shocked the country. Jiangyin has such a huge corruption case, and the government neither stopped it in advance nor strictly dealt with it afterward. What is the system? In addition, the staff in each office do not allow people to go through the main gate but through the back door, forcing them to pay the rice banks. If the members of this assembly do not appeal for the people, it will be extremely shameful. Deputy Director Hong then replied that a thorough investigation will be carried out. County Magistrate Fang was also present, often reporting that the grain office's seal has been handed over by guards. This huge corruption case has entered a serious situation, and an urgent telegram has been sent to the Provincial Field and Grain Office for instructions.

### It is True that Famous Figures in Suzhou Extorted Money; Fan Junbo Indicted; Three Others, including Lu Tiesun, Not Prosecuted

[This newspaper's Suzhou dispatch, 25th] The case of Fan Junbo and others, famous figures in Suzhou, extorting money, which has attracted attention from all parties, was transferred from the city defense department to the district prosecutor's office. After detailed investigation by prosecutor Xiao Qi for more than ten days, and two inquiries, Fan Junbo was indicted on the 25th on charges of fraud. The other three, Lu Tiesun, Wang Yizhi, and Wu Bingzhang, were considered victims. Although they helped raise funds, they did not embezzle or profit from it, so they were not prosecuted. The main points of Fan Junbo's indictment and the relevant legal articles are recorded below: (1) Fan Junbo took advantage of the government's crackdown on underground banks to tell Lu Tiesun and others, who are well-known heads of underground banks, after Double Ten Day, that the county government was purchasing uniforms and lacked sewing fees, and instructed Lu and others to raise 10 million yuan from various underground banks. Later, 6 million yuan was sent in three batches on October 20-30 and personally received by Fan. All the facts have been confessed. Although he argued that his friend Li Zengyong had advanced the funds because he was contracting the manufacture of uniforms, and therefore asked Lu Tiesun and the other three to borrow the money on behalf of him out of private friendship, it was found that the county government signed the contract with Li Zengyong on November 9. Around Double Ten Day, Li Zengyong did not know that the county government would manufacture uniforms, so how could he have asked Fan Junbo to borrow money in advance? From this, it is evident that Fan Junbo's deception is true. (2) Although it was argued that the money was returned to the original owners separately on December 3, it was found that it was an act after the city defense department summoned them on January 16, which has nothing to do with the completion of the crime. (3) In summary, Fan Junbo committed the crime under Article 339, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law and should be prosecuted. Special Commissioner Sent by the Ministry of National Defense for Thorough Investigation

Assemblymen Wang Guanzhi and Chu Zuoshi expressed that the shipping revenue figures in the construction report did not match the actual revenue figures. In recent days, administrative reports at the congress have taken up too much time, affecting the time for assemblymen's inquiries. Tong Chunxuan temporarily proposed that government administrative reports be limited to no more than one hour, which was unanimously passed. In addition, Finance Director Pu Mengjiu and Education Director Wang Shaolun were away on official business and had not returned, so the group review meetings were held in advance, and the dates for the finance and education reports were set separately.

### Nantong River Dike Prepared for Construction

[This Newspaper Nantong Dispatch] The river dike in this county has been in disrepair for many years, resulting in significant losses. Except for the section of the stone dike from Tianshenggang to Zhouhuang Yini Mountain, which is still intact, the rest is mostly low and thin, insufficient to withstand the tide. The breach in the summer of this year inundated many fields. Almost all of the outer dike has collapsed. The county government has repeatedly requested the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Committee Jiangsu District Dike Closure and Restoration Project Office and the Su-Ning Branch Office to allocate funds for repairs as soon as possible, in order to reduce the disaster situation. The project office sent Deputy Engineer Li Yi to Nantong to investigate, estimating a total need of 116,698.2080 cubic units, 175 tons and 9460 jin of flour, and 35009460 yuan in legal tender.

### Zhejiang Grain Bureau Chief Urges Collection

[This Newspaper Wuxing Dispatch] This year's land tax has been repeatedly ordered by the provincial government to be fully collected by the end of the year. However, due to the many difficulties in this county after the war, it has not been possible to collect the full amount. Chen Yi, the chief of the Zhejiang Provincial Grain Bureau, accompanied by Wang Jingyu, a commissioner of the Ministry of Food, arrived in Huzhou from Hangzhou on the 22nd. In the afternoon, they convened a symposium at the county government with the heads of party, government, military, and civic organizations. Chief Chen and Commissioner Wang successively gave speeches, stating that land tax is the main source of income for the central, provincial, and county governments. This land tax collection is particularly urgent and must be fully collected by the end of this year. Any delays will affect important political affairs and will be strictly dealt with.

### Danyang Shops: Closure Wind Prevails

[This Newspaper Danyang Dispatch] Since autumn, the trend of shop closures in this city has been particularly prevalent. After winter, closures have become even more intense. Closures of shops are of course not subject to criticism in the name of liquidation, but after the shops in this city close, the actual amount of their liquidation is only about 30-40% of the net capital. Shops such as Tianfutai Xinhua in Shuangjing Lane only return about 10-20%. The method of dealing with creditors is to use the shop to cover the debts. This is not bankruptcy liquidation. This kind of liquidation method can indeed fuel the wind of fraudulent closures, which will have serious consequences. Therefore, there is no need for bankruptcy liquidation to pay off debts. Some shops still have the remaining strength, but they must deliberately empty the shop, and then suddenly announce the closure. This kind of attempt has already been seen in the city, and it is simply like a scam.

### Suzhou Launches Science Relief, Students Collect Old Clothes

[This Newspaper Suzhou Dispatch] The Suzhou City Defense Command's Social Guidance Office believes that during the winter, the poor people of Suzhou are exposed to the elements, which is very pitiful.

### Why is the Power Supply in Ba City Uneven?

I live at No. 335 Fumin Road, Nanshi. Every day when I come home to rest after work, I always live in complete darkness without electricity. No matter what I do, I have to grope in the dark. The power outage lasts from morning until 6:00 p.m. or even after 7:00 p.m. In this period of traffic disruption and serious coal shortage, we forgive the hardships of the China Merchants Electric Company. But what we cannot tolerate is that during our power outage time, Laoximen, Laobeimen, Xiaodongmen, and other places are brightly lit, like daytime. If there is not enough electricity, you can adopt a rotating power outage system. Why has the power been out in the Dadongmen, Xiaonanmen, and Dadanmen areas for more than a week, while other areas have electricity every day? Please give a clear answer to the China Merchants Electric Company. (Zheng Yongxiang)

### Plea to Remove Air Raid Shelter

A concrete air raid shelter stands in the fields south of Jiahe Farm, Liuliqiao, Pudong. It was built by our army last summer. Now that the war is over, the air raid shelter has not yet been removed. However, because the air raid shelter is very strong and has a large volume, it is often used as a shelter for villains, and incidents that endanger public security occur from time to time. The owner of the field has repeatedly requested the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works to remove it quickly, but no action has been taken so far, and no instructions have been issued. Therefore, I am writing to your newspaper to urge the authorities of the Municipal Bureau of Public Works to pay attention! (Wu Shujing)

### Small Hotels in Western Shanghai Should be Corrected

What I want to report to you is the bad situation of small hotels in the Shanghai West area, such as the hotels in Huai'an Road, Maigen Road, and Kader Road. Recently, they have refused to accommodate regular merchants, because a regular guest usually calculates the room fee for one day for two half-days or a whole night (such as from 1:00 p.m. to 12:00 p.m. the next day, not exceeding 24 hours). However, for general unofficial passengers who use the hotel as a place for men and women to meet illegally, a few hours are calculated as one day's room fee, and there are extra small accounts. Therefore, the bosses and waiters of these small hotels are particularly welcome, so that regular guests are refused. They would rather leave the rooms empty and make huge profits. For example, when a regular guest goes to book a room, the waiter must ask, "Sir, are you staying overnight?" If the answer is yes, then the waiter will impolitely say, "Sorry, we are full, there are no rooms!" In fact, many rooms are empty. Passengers who are unlucky or passing through this port can only sigh. It is extremely painful in this severe winter season when the cold wind is blowing. When I see this bad situation, I cannot remain silent, so I dare to borrow a corner of the newspaper to disclose it. (A worker in western Shanghai)

### The Bad Habit of Extorting Money Should Be Eliminated

There is a bad habit in this port that has been inherited from the concession era, which is most popular among the middle and lower classes: "sending invitation cards to extort money." In addition to real weddings and funerals, they falsely claim "fake birthdays," "fake birthday banquets," "death anniversaries," children's "birthdays," "full moons," etc. Some even celebrate every two or three months. In an ordinary family, they receive more than a dozen invitation cards a month, that is, more than a dozen invitations cards for 10,000 yuan each, which would cost more than one hundred thousand. In this time of difficult living, how can they cope? I ask the government to adopt effective measures based on the principle of thrift in the New Life Movement and strictly prohibit this bad habit! (Sun Ru)

### Postal Service

Reply to a certain gentleman: Your letter pointed out the illegal actions of the head of Mao Cheng Township. The Pinghu County Government has replied in a letter: "Zhu Xuezhi, the head of Mao Cheng Township, sent Hou Meifu, the squad leader of the National Soldiers, and Wang Wenrong, a township soldier, to Wang Jiaming's house on the 25th day of the tenth lunar month to collect the price difference for military rations. Because his wife was briefly arrogant, he sent her to the office for handling. She was released after the persuasion of the bao chief Zhu Xiaodi. She died that night due to miscarriage. Her husband sued the county court. The defendant, Hou Meifu, has a heavier suspicion and is being detained for investigation." Special reply.

Recently received two replies from the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works: (1) "Xu Zhonghe Jun stated that the Xijiao Road was damaged, etc., and ordered the inspection of the old asphalt pavement of the sidewalk. The damaged area is now estimated to be 50 square meters. In addition to filling the pits with coal first, repairs can be made when old asphalt gravel materials are available." (2) "Liu Zizhuang Jun pointed out that the area around Guangzhao Road is dirty and unclean, etc. The relevant sanitation part has been transferred to the Health Bureau for handling. As for the broken drains, the damage could not be repaired because the Ministry of Military Affairs was blocked. Now that it has been unsealed, efforts are being made to replace the missing covers of all manholes with stone strips." Combined reply.

### Bengbu Winter News

— Our Correspondent Qian Mengchao

The cold wave has reached Bengbu, and it is the middle of winter. The Huai embankment and Bengshan mountains are full of withered trees and yellow leaves. After the ravages of war and floods, the cries of refugees fill the roads, begging for food. The Rapid Relief Headquarters for Refugees in Eastern Anhui, Jing District, has been announced, but it is still unknown when relief goods will be distributed. Tens of thousands of disaster-stricken people are eagerly waiting. The fundraising committee for the Bengbu City Relief Center has been established for a long time, and the funds raised are said to be as high as forty to fifty million yuan. However, when the relief center will be officially established is still unknown.

Strengthening Winter Defense: Executing Two Bandits as a Warning

During the period when the poor are suffering from the cold, it is precisely when petty thieves take the opportunity to be active. The pacification authorities here, in view of the dense population and complex traffic in Bengbu, with people from all walks of life, good and bad mixed together, and considering that it is winter defense season and public security is a major concern, have stipulated four measures to maintain public order, ordering them to be strictly followed. The four measures are: (1) Strengthen the inspection work of the checkpoints to prevent spies from infiltrating the market and disrupting public order. (2) Order the joint military, police, and gendarmerie patrol teams to strictly enforce orders, rectify soldiers with improper attire, and crack down on stray soldiers. (3) Send teams to inspect businesses, hotels, brothels in sections every night, crack down on soldiers patronizing prostitutes, and prevent unscrupulous elements from hiding in them. (4) Investigate the household registration movements of residents in this city and conduct a census to prevent spies from lurking. Although the military and police agencies are strictly enforcing these measures, robbery cases are still occurring frequently. On the evening of the 6th of this month, the home of Chen Yi, a resident of Huangshan Bao in the Xishi District, was completely looted by more than ten bandits, who also killed Chen's father, Zhao Hui, with a knife and took away the nine-year-old boy, Chen Jiayu. In the afternoon of the 6th and 7th, cases of fraud and robbery of gold and silver jewelry occurred. The victims were Heji Laofengxiang, Yuanji Laofengxiang, and Laotianbao, three shops in the bustling Erma Road. The bandits were extremely bold in their robbery. The Eighth District Pacification Headquarters, on the afternoon of the 9th, tied up two soldiers who had committed robbery in groups during the summer and executed them by shooting outside Nangang in Bengbu. One was Huang Bin from Yangshuo, Guangxi, and the other was Xie Senqiao from Guilin, Guangxi. They had both served as soldiers in the supply bureau and were executed for robbing shops on Zhasu Road. The authorities clearly intended to kill one as a warning to a hundred, to deter the bandits.

Collapse Feared: The Wave of Bankruptcies is Rampant in the Market

Natural disasters and man-made calamities, one after another, are reflected in the unrest among bandits and concerns about public security. The tide of economic recession, like the autumn floods, is surging towards Zhashi. As winter arrives, the market is characterized by coldness and loneliness. Now, almost the entire market is shrouded in the shadow of collapse. The industry and commerce here are approaching the brink of collapse, and some have even fallen into the abyss of collapse. The closure of shops is a concrete manifestation of the economic recession in Bengbu.

According to custom, the phenomenon of tight credit usually occurs at the end of the lunar year. However, the beginning of this cold winter is the season for everyone to buy clothes and stock up on food to prepare for the winter. However, although large and small shops are doing their best to attract customers, hiring Western music bands to play loudly, and posting signs of "big discounts," "big sales," "60% off clearance," and "unprecedented sacrifices" to attract customers, there are few customers. This shows the decline in the purchasing power of citizens and the extreme stagnation of finance.

The wave of bankruptcies, along with the cold wind, is almost sweeping through the entire Bengbu market. It is circling through various industries like a whirlwind. Shops and various firms are being forced to close down or announce liquidation due to the impact of the economic recession, which is heard almost every day. According to a survey by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, 33 companies went bankrupt in September, 17 in October, and 32 again in November. In this month, the Daxin Department Store on Erma Road and the Yiji Zhengye Tannery on Zhengping Street have also closed down one after another. As the end of the year approaches, it is feared that there will still be firms that will be forced to close down.

Underground Banks: Extremely Active in Secret

During this time when the wave of bankruptcies is rampant in various industries, only the silver and money industry is thriving, and the discounting business is particularly good. Before the war, there were more than 20 silver and money shops in this city. Now, there are seven banks: Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Farmers Bank, Shanghai Bank, Anhui Bank, and Bengbu City Bank. There is one silver firm: Yumin, Xinchangxiang. There are nine money shops: Fucheng, Anli, etc. In addition, there are secret underground banks operating. Due to the needs of the objective environment, they are springing up like mushrooms after rain and are extremely active, engaging in high-interest discounting or lending operations. They are indeed the evil hands of high-interest loans in Bengbu. According to Yu Haoru, the manager of the Bengbu branch of the Central Bank, he told reporters that the formation of high-interest loans is due to the economic recession. It cannot be said that high-interest loans cause the economic recession. Rather, high-interest loans arise because of the needs of the market. Merchants know that drinking poison to quench thirst is not a good idea, but they are willing to do so because they have no choice. Underground banks issuing high-interest loans is undoubtedly an illegal act, but those engaged in this business are mostly secretive. The Central Bank has the power to ban and stop it, but it is not easy to detect them. (16th)

### French Paratroopers Transferred to Vietnam for Reinforcements: Fierce Fighting Underway Throughout Northern Vietnam

[Central News Agency London, 24th dispatch] According to French intelligence in London, the 25th Airborne Division of paratroopers stationed in Bona, Algeria, North Africa, will be dispatched to Vietnam.

[Reuters Paris, 24th dispatch] It is reported that a portion of the paratroopers from the First Paratrooper Division have already departed from the port of Bona in Algeria yesterday on the cruiser "De Grasse" en route to Vietnam. An official from the French Ministry of Defense here stated that the Ministry of Defense does not intend to confirm or deny the news of the paratroopers' transfer to Vietnam, as troop movements should be kept secret.

[Central News Agency Paris, 24th, United Press] According to Agence France-Presse, a communiqué from the French military headquarters in Hanoi stated that the fighting throughout northern Vietnam is fierce, but the situation is "satisfactory."

[Agence France-Presse Hanoi, 24th dispatch] According to an official communiqué, a considerable number of Japanese people have been discovered within the Vietnamese forces in the Vietnamese War. French troops are currently conducting mopping-up operations in the Bo Kan area south of Hanoi. French troops encountered resistance from Vietnamese forces on the highway to Hue. French aircraft destroyed several Vietnamese artillery positions yesterday. Officials believe that the situation in Tonkin is satisfactory. In Bac Ninh, the area controlled by French troops has been expanded, and Vietnamese attacks have been repelled several times. The details of the large-scale fighting in the coastal area of Tonkin (between Hanoi and Haiphong) are still unknown. In Annam, Hue City was bombarded by Vietnamese artillery, but the firing was not accurate. The rumor that Vietnamese forces had occupied the Tourane airfield has now been denied by the French military headquarters in Hanoi. The situation in Nghe An is unclear. It is reported that a French military unit there has accepted an ultimatum from the Vietnamese side. The bodies of forty-four French civilian victims have been found.

[Agence France-Presse Saigon, 24th dispatch] A curfew has been declared in the Saigon and Cholon districts from 10:00 PM to 5:00 AM since the 14th of this month. Officials stated that the curfew is purely a precautionary measure to prevent incidents.

### The Birth of the French Fourth Republic: The Senate Held Its First Meeting Yesterday; Presidential Election to Be Held in January

[Associated Press Paris, 24th dispatch] The French Fourth Republic was formally established today. This is the first constitutional government since the German invasion six years ago. On the day of the Republic's birth, the Vietnamese War is raging, threatening the foundation of the colonial empire. The Republic's Senate is scheduled to convene on January 16 to elect a president. The first presidential candidate is the 62-year-old Socialist leader, Auriol, the current Speaker of the National Assembly. The new president will appoint a prime minister to form a new cabinet to replace Blum's interim cabinet.

[Agence France-Presse Paris, 24th dispatch] The Senate of the French Republic held its first meeting at the Luxembourg Palace at 2:30 PM today. The oldest senator, Cachen, served as interim chairman and delivered a welcoming speech, praising the French army's ability to liberate France with the help of the Allied forces. At the same time, he also expressed admiration for General de Gaulle, which aroused enthusiastic applause from all senators (except for the Communist senators). Before the end of the opening ceremony, Cachen met with the heads of various party delegations to establish a presidium. According to the principle of proportional distribution, the thirteen members of the presidium are distributed as follows: four each for the Popular Republican Party and the Communist Party, two each for the Socialist Party and the Leftist Union Party, and one for the Rightist Union Party. There are also three vice-chairmen, six secretaries, and six financial secretaries.

[Reuters Paris, 24th dispatch] The French Fourth Republic has been formally established. Henceforth, the laws passed by the National Assembly must be submitted to the Senate for review. The Senate has the right to send bills back to the Assembly for reconsideration, but cannot veto them. The Senate is scheduled to elect a speaker on Friday. The candidate with the best chance of being elected is Triboulet of the Popular Republican Party, who served as a cabinet member as early as 1929. He was a strong opponent of Vichy and the Germans during the war. It is said that the Socialist Party also intends to support Triboulet as the speaker of the Senate. At the same time, various political parties are actively preparing for the presidential election. Formal candidates have not yet been nominated, but informal candidates include former Prime Minister Herriot, leader of the Radical Party, and Assembly Speaker Auriol. Herriot has supported the views of the Communist Party and is therefore strongly supported by the Communist Party. The constitution stipulates that the president is elected by members of both the Senate and the Assembly meeting in Versailles. However, the constitution does not specify whether to use open or secret voting.

### The United States Has No Objections to France's Plan for Germany

[Agence France-Presse Washington, 24th dispatch] The decisions taken by France regarding the control of the Saar region's borders have not provoked objections from U.S. officials. A State Department spokesman recently told reporters that the head of the French delegation to the United Nations, Mauville, had informed the French and American governments of the administrative changes. The U.S. representative had never protested against the French plan during negotiations with France.

[Agence France-Presse Paris, 24th dispatch] The French government has decided to release 70 German prisoners of war in the Saar region in the near future. These prisoners of war work in French coal mines and were allowed to return home to visit their families this summer.

### The World Food Situation: The Future Is Not Optimistic

[Associated Press Washington, 24th dispatch] The Secretary-General of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, Orr, announced today that the current world food situation has not improved compared to last year and that there will be a great shortage before the 1947 harvest season. In addition to the damage caused by the war, the countries of the East will have to prepare sufficient food for the increasing population in the coming years. This situation becomes more prominent every year. The second half of 1946 proved to be deficient in most regions, but the new harvest starting in 1947 will greatly improve the situation. In the nine eastern provinces of China, Korea, and Taiwan, the post-war impact has kept grain production at a low standard. In terms of rice exports, the acreage under cultivation in Burma, Siam, and Vietnam continues to be lower than the average, with only a small amount of stock available for export.

### Spaak's Report: The UN General Assembly

Says the harvest was quite significant

[Agence France-Presse Brussels, 24th dispatch] Belgian Foreign Minister and President of the United Nations General Assembly, Spaak, has just returned to this city from New York. He recently gave a speech to the press, reporting that the results obtained by this United Nations General Assembly were quite significant, can be regarded as positive in nature, and said that this United Nations General Assembly also had its shortcomings, to put it bluntly: (1) The location used by the United Nations organization to hold meetings is too far from the city; (2) Representatives of various countries use their own languages, which makes the debate too slow, but some issues, especially the South African Indian issue and the Spanish Franco regime issue, have been resolved, which is quite satisfactory. In terms of the issue of disarmament, significant progress has been made, which is a further step than we had hoped. The United Nations organization is very different from the old League of Nations. The old League of Nations was a conference of diplomats, while the United Nations General Assembly is a conference of politicians. This is the difference. Women occupy important positions everywhere in the United Nations organization, which is eye-catching, and the position of "people of color" is also becoming increasingly important. Regarding the German question, the four foreign ministers are scheduled to meet in Moscow on March 20 next year to discuss the matter. Belgium has not yet received an invitation to participate. As for Belgium's demands on Germany, it can only be explained in detail to the government and parliament later. In short, there are still many factors in the German question that are not fully understood. If you engage in it rashly, you will definitely make a big mistake. On the contrary, if you let it mature, you will gain something.

### 800,000 Nazi Youths: The United States Announces Amnesty

The rectification plan can be completed within eighteen months; improving the German economy so that it can be self-sufficient

[Associated Press Frankfurt, 24th dispatch] Commander of the U.S. Occupation Forces in Germany, McNairney, delivered a Christmas message to 3,000 Germans at the Leunburg Square today, announcing an amnesty for 800,000 "Little Nazi Party Members" in the U.S. Occupation Zone, which was greeted with cheers from the crowd. These people are not guilty of major crimes, have not been involved in embezzlement, and are semi-disabled. The disabled alone account for 40,000 people. McNairney announced a fundamental change in the U.S. Nazi purge policy, hoping that Germans would step up their efforts to expose "active Nazi elements who are destroying the motherland." Lee continued, the U.S. Occupation Forces had no concept of revenge on Germany in the beginning. The current situation in Germany is due to the Nazi dictatorship. The United States will do its best to improve Germany's economic situation. The British and American occupation zones have already implemented economic mergers, and the economy will be self-sufficient in three years. U.S. officials estimate that this amnesty will complete the rectification plan in the U.S. Occupation Zone within eighteen months. Previously, officials announced that at the current rate of reporting, it would take eight years to complete.

[Agence France-Presse Athens, 24th dispatch] Acting Prime Minister of Greece, Gonatas, has just returned from inspecting northern Greece and told the press that the situation in northern Greece has greatly improved. The army and gendarmerie have taken joint action, which is a serious blow to the guerrillas. Everywhere I went, I was warmly welcomed by the local people.

It is generally believed that the Prime Minister will extend his stay in the United States to maintain contact with representatives of relevant commercial firms in the United States. These commercial firms are preparing to carry out reconstruction work in Greece.

### The Japanese Aristocratic Class Will Be Reduced to Commoners

From now on, they will only live a life of hardship

[Our Tokyo Dispatch, 25th] The military and financial cliques that once drove the Japanese people have completely collapsed. The imperial and aristocratic systems, which still maintain feudal institutions, are now being reviewed by the Diet and the Privy Council. Except for the three direct imperial families, the other eleven imperial families and fifty-two nobles have decided to be demoted to commoners from next spring. In addition, the government has stopped supplying the aristocratic class with the so-called aristocratic fees, and the tax exemption privileges that the aristocratic class once had have also been decided to be abolished. Therefore, the nobles who once enjoyed a life of luxury will also live the same life of hardship as ordinary people.

### Japanese Earthquake Damage Statistics

[Our News] San Francisco Broadcast, 25th: The Japanese Ministry of Home Affairs recently released the following statistics on the losses from the earthquake and tsunami: 1,172 deaths, 1,555 injuries, and 163 missing. 7,149 houses were completely destroyed, 14,349 houses were damaged, 33 factories were completely destroyed, and 19 were partially destroyed.

### Japanese Domestic Debt: 300 Billion Yen

Eleven times larger than before the war

[Remodeling Society Tokyo, 25th dispatch] According to a report on domestic debt and government loans submitted by the Japanese Ministry of Finance to the House of Peers, as of the 20th of this month, the amount of domestic debt was 150.499 billion yen, government loans were 23.397 billion yen, and government short-term securities were 20.62 billion yen, totaling 194.516 billion yen. However, within this year, the government has already planned to issue 46.507 billion yen in public bonds. By the end of this year, the total debt will be 240 billion yen. If the 30 billion yen in war insurance compensation public bonds are added, it will reach 270 billion yen. If an additional budget needs to be submitted to the regular Diet, then public bonds will have to be issued again. It is feared that by the end of this year, the amount of domestic debt may reach 300 billion yen, which is eleven times larger than the domestic debt of 25 billion yen in 1940, before the start of the Pacific War.

### Economic Controls Fail: Siam醞醸醞釀Political Upheaval: Former Prime Minister Khuang Aphaiwong to Make a Comeback

[Agence France-Presse Bangkok, 24th dispatch] Political figures here in Siam recently said that the latent turmoil among Siamese parliamentarians may trigger a serious political upheaval. This unrest is caused by the high degree of restrictions on commercial life and the control of food supplies. The crisis first broke out in the government itself, and then spread to various parties. However, well-informed sources here are particularly reserved about changes in the government's lineup and its policies. It is generally expected that if a political upheaval occurs, former Prime Minister Khuang Aphaiwong, the leader of the Democratic Party, will be able to take on the arduous task. Khuang Aphaiwong previously resigned as Prime Minister because the Parliament passed the economic control bill. He is currently in the United States and is said to be returning to Siam in the near future.

### Roosevelt's Son Arrives in England to Talk About His Meeting with Stalin

[Agence France-Presse London, 24th dispatch] Oliver Roosevelt, son of the late U.S. President Roosevelt, and his wife arrived here by plane from Moscow today after a recent trip to the Soviet Union.

When reporters asked Roosevelt's son how he got to see Marshal Stalin, it was said that "it was done in the usual way." Reporters also asked the son to comment on Britain's plan to erect a statue of his father in London. The son said that he did not want to participate in the debate about whether the statue should be sitting or standing, but that the original intention of building the statue was a great honor.

### US Industrial Production Value Has Made Significant Progress

The future depends on the labor situation

[Associated Press Washington, 25th dispatch] President Truman announced today that production after the recovery of U.S. industry has increased by at least 50% compared to the average production in 1930, and in the past six months, it has repeatedly set new production records for peacetime. Former Director of the Private Production Business Administration, Small, said in a report submitted to President Truman that labor and management must cooperate to avoid strikes from happening again, otherwise the good results obtained in post-war production and employment will be lost. In fact, the current number of employed people in the United States has reached its peak, between 57 million and 58 million people, a record unprecedented in American history. This number is 14 million more than the number of employed people during the war in 1939.

### Christmas Eve: A Heartfelt Appeal

The Pope said: The Church is like a compassionate mother, with mercy as its divine duty. To promote human sympathy and mutual assistance, there are things that must be said...

[Reuters, Vatican City, 24th] Pope Pius XII broadcast to the people of the world on Christmas Eve, earnestly appealing to leaders of all nations to strive to achieve a just peace. He asked the victorious nations to abandon selfish concepts and consider the needs of the majority of people, especially the youth. The Pope pointed out that the rift between the victorious and defeated nations was more profound than after any previous war. To this day, the consequences of victory and their impact remain a source of pain. Human love and the Catholic Church cannot stand idly by in the face of such phenomena. From the Church's perspective, it only seeks to guide people towards eternal salvation and has no intention of interfering with or participating in world disputes. The Church is like a compassionate mother, with mercy as its divine duty. Now, to promote human sympathy and mutual assistance, there are things that must be said. Remembering the initial creation of the Atlantic Charter, the people of the world were overjoyed. However, to this day, the various difficulties in establishing peace have not been overcome. It is deeply hoped that the leaders of all nations will exert their great power to establish a just peace and accomplish this great task. None of us can say that the world's problems have already been clearly resolved. How to deal with unprecedented new weapons has been discussed in conference sessions, but they may still prevent the future peace treaty from being entirely satisfactory. Therefore, the Church's appeal is truly necessary in the current environment. The Church is not afraid of the current anti-religious surge in various places. It is our duty to speak out for justice. I express my deep concern and sympathy for the suffering of the people in war-torn countries. In April, I already urged other national governments and people to provide assistance. Since then, people with humanitarian and Christian spirit have responded enthusiastically, allowing the glory of humanity to be further promoted. However, because the disaster area is vast, the aid is still insufficient. Therefore, it is hoped that those with spare resources will actively save the suffering and starving people, especially children and youth facing famine, regardless of boundaries or nationalities, and do their best to provide aid, so that the concepts of revenge and competition can be thoroughly eliminated, and a Christian world of great harmony can be rebuilt in the shattered civilization.

### Truman's Address

[Reuters, Washington, 24th] President Truman, in his Christmas address to the American people, stated: We have completed a good starting point for the establishment of world peace. However, there remains the significant task of safeguarding world peace in the future. The world today seems to lack harmony and compromise. We now know that it is easier for humanity to share adversity than to share prosperity. But if we cannot maintain peace, then the lives of soldiers are truly sacrificed in vain. The problems faced by the United Nations organization are daunting, but as we continue to strive for peace, we should not forget that the world was not built in a day. Fortunately, this Christmas, the overall situation is improving, which should be encouraging.

### Beneš's Broadcast

[Reuters, Prague, 24th] Czech President Dr. Beneš, in his Christmas Eve broadcast to the nation, expressed his belief that there would be no more world wars in this generation. He pointed out that the global situation before Christmas showed that the friendship between major leading countries was increasingly strengthened, and the foundation of peace was increasingly consolidated. The world is now eagerly awaiting the completion of the German peace treaty. Germany itself must repent for its past and implement spiritual peace and democracy to prove its determination to correct its mistakes.

### Unprecedented Tragedy in Dense Fog: Three Passenger Planes Crash on the Same Night. One of the China National Aviation Corporation planes from Chongqing crashes and burns in Longhua. Nearly all 29 passengers and crew members perish.

[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday, the weather in this city was exceptionally bad. Dense rain and fog covered the Longhua Airport, obscuring the ground. As a result, yesterday evening, two China National Aviation Corporation passenger planes arriving in Shanghai from Chongqing were unable to land and crashed at the airport and in Huadi, Pudong, respectively, resulting in heavy casualties. Another Central Air Transport Corporation passenger plane arriving in Shanghai from Nanjing managed to land near Jiangwan Airport, which was a better outcome.

Around 9:00 AM yesterday, two China National Aviation Corporation passenger planes took off from Chongqing to come to Shanghai. One was a C-47 model, number 140, flown by American pilot Greenwood, co-pilot Mr. Liu (L.S. Liu), and radio operator Mr. Jin (K. King), which took off from the Coral Dam Battlefield in Chongqing. The other was a C-46 model, number 115, flown by American pilot Prdus, co-pilot Mr. Tan (H.C. Tan), and radio operator Mr. Wang (S.T. Wang), which took off from Baishi, Chongqing.

Around 1:00 PM, the two planes stopped in Hankou one after the other, then continued flying to Shanghai. When passing Nanjing, due to the extremely bad weather in Nanjing, they did not land and flew directly to Shanghai.

Plane number 140 first arrived in the Shanghai airspace around 5:00 PM. Due to the dense fog, it was unable to land. Although it repeatedly contacted the airport's radio control tower, reporting that it could not determine the direction of the runway, there was ultimately no way to land. Therefore, plane number 140 circled in the air for two and eleven-twelfths hours. At 7:55 PM, the plane was directly above the airport. Its fuel ran out, and it immediately lost its flying ability. The nose of the plane suddenly tilted downward and crashed directly into the ground. Initially, the sound of the engine was barely audible, then a sharp, ear-piercing sound cut through the night sky as it plunged towards the ground. In an instant, with a loud crash, the plane crashed and burned at the airport. At that time, a small fire started. Airport personnel were urgently preparing rescue measures and had already called two fire trucks and two ambulances from the fire department, which had arrived on the scene to wait. At this time, they rushed to the crash site for emergency rescue.

Our newspaper reporter obtained news of the accident within ten minutes after the plane crashed and immediately rushed to Longhua Airport to investigate. The plane crashed about ten yards to the side of the north-south runway, only two or three hundred yards south of the South Huangpu River. The tail of the plane faced northwest. The section from the middle of the fuselage, the door, five feet up, to the nose, was completely shattered. The wings flew more than ten yards away, separated from the body. The tail was raised and also broken, indicating the intensity of the impact. Within a range of more than ten storefronts near the crash site, there were dead male and female passengers and broken clothing ejected from the plane. Using the light of a flashlight, the reporter witnessed the body of a woman in her twenties, dressed beautifully, lying face down in the mud five feet from the plane door.

It was later confirmed that there were 26 passengers on the plane. Thirteen people died at the scene. The remaining thirteen people (nine men, four women) were rushed to Zhongshan Hospital, where six died on the way. Only seven people were actually treated urgently by the hospital. The reporter went to the hospital to inquire. According to the doctor, after surgery, it was confirmed that two were in critical condition, four were in uncertain condition, and only one had a good chance of survival. Among the above people, four were women, one dead, one in critical condition, and two in uncertain condition. The company was still inquiring with Chongqing for the list of dead and injured passengers, so it could not be clarified by the time of writing. According to the reporter's observation, the only person who was slightly injured had a severely swollen face, was bandaged, and was mumbling incoherently, and what he said was mostly unreliable.

It was also learned that the main pilot died from a ruptured brain, and the co-pilot had a pierced intestine and abdomen and could not be saved. Only the radio operator, Mr. Jin, was sent to the hospital.

The Second Passenger Plane Crashes in Quick Succession

When plane number 140 crashed, plane number 115 was still circling in the sky and was also unable to land. The reporter, driving to the entrance of the airport, saw the plane suddenly fly from south to north, across the sky, only about two hundred feet above the ground. This was around 9:10 PM. From then on, the airport no longer heard any news of it. China National Aviation Corporation personnel later received a report that plane number 115 had also crashed in Pudong at 9:30 PM. They immediately sent personnel to search everywhere. The US Navy and the Water Police Bureau also dispatched ships to assist in the search. However, its wreckage had not been found by midnight.

According to the reporter's inquiry with the guards on the south bank of the Huangpu River and the gatekeeper of the Shanghai Cement Factory, they saw the plane flying low from the northeast towards the southwest, and then heard a loud bang, but did not see any fire. The general location was five or six miles south of the Taishan Cement Factory in Pudong.

The Central Air Transport Corporation plane was also forced

As for a Central Air Transport Corporation passenger plane, after being warned by the control tower, it flew to Jiangwan Airport and was finally forced to land near the Wenzaobang River.

Repeated requests were made to the China Textile Company for replacements, and more than 5,000 yards of returned goods were sent to the China Textile Company for inspection and acceptance. Recently, the company has been rushing to allocate cloth materials to public education personnel in Beijing, so the new goods have not been delivered as quickly as possible.

### Preparing to Commemorate Dai Tianfang, Who Devoted His Life to Dental Education and Tragically Died in a Plane Crash

He died in a plane crash in Changxing on the 14th while traveling from Nanjing to Shanghai on official business with the Central Aircraft Company. Dai had profound knowledge and was one of the few dental experts in our country. After graduating from West China University in 1934, he served as the director of the dental department of the Shanghai Municipal Hospital, which was sponsored by the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau. After the outbreak of the war, he served in a hospital in Guangxi Province under the Ministry of Health. In 1940, he went to the United States to specialize in public oral hygiene. In 1942, he returned to China and served as the vice president of the School of Dentistry of West China University and the director of the Oral Hospital.

### American Merchant Ship Damages Underwater Cable, Power Supply to Pudong Temporarily Suspended

At 2:10 PM yesterday, the American merchant ship StagHound, at the Shipaotai area in Nanshi, its anchor hooked the 33,000-volt underwater cable when raising anchor, causing the cable to be damaged, the iron tower bent, and the joint broken. The entire Pudong area immediately lost power, also affecting the Shanghai Ding switch, causing the current in Zhabei and Nanshi to be interrupted at the same time. The relevant electrical companies rushed to repair the switch in West Shanghai, and Zhabei and Nanshi were restored to power one after another. However, the cable in Pudong was severely damaged, and it took time to repair, so the power supply to the entire area could not be temporarily supplied. The motors used by the factory must be temporarily suspended. It is reported that there are still two cables connecting the Pudong Electrical Company and Shanghai Tongdian, one at 6,600 volts and one at 500 volts, which can be connected, but the capacity is too small and can only maintain part of the lights.

### Two Major US Cruisers Stationed in Shanghai Host Orphaned Children. The distressed children rejected outside the gates of paradise enjoy half a day of heavenly life.

[Special Feature from Our Newspaper] Christmas has passed. Although a Christmas dinner costs 100,000 yuan per person, and the tea fee in dance halls has risen to 30,000 yuan per cup, with an additional ticket charge, the entertainment venues are still full. Many privileged people indulged in merriment during this happy season, chewing on turkey, sipping champagne, and reveling until dawn!

Also on Christmas Eve, also in Shanghai, perhaps right in front of the dance hall doors, at the foot of the cafe walls, those forgotten wretches were enduring the torment of hunger and cold, struggling on the lifeline with their last breath!

Naturally, the darlings in the greenhouse would never know, who would want those ragged beggars to spoil the festive atmosphere on this auspicious occasion?

Enthusiastically Hosted to Spend a Wonderful Day

Grateful for the warmth of our Chinese friends, in the midst of excessive joy, they still did not forget the Chinese children living in hardship. The two major cruisers docked on the Huangpu River, the USS Los Angeles and the USS Helena, specially hosted 200 orphans and children from the Caohhejing Refugee Orphanage in this city and dozens of Russian refugee children for Christmas, allowing those children who had wandered the streets and been rejected outside the gates of paradise to enjoy half a day of heavenly life.

The US Navy's hospitality was very thoughtful. At exactly 12:00 noon, two giant landing crafts were waiting on the beach. They helped the children into the boats one by one, and then onto the cruisers. They first served them a hearty Western meal, then led them around for sightseeing, showed movies in the auditorium, and finally Santa Claus, dressed up, distributed a large number of gifts...

Hearty Western Meals, Candy, and Gifts

This day was extraordinary for those refugee children. Landing crafts, cruisers, the local specialty of Shanghai White Pagoda, SW coffee, high-quality Western cuisine, Walt Disney's cartoon movies, Santa Claus in a big red robe, candies and toys in stockings... Everything was unprecedented, and everything will forever become a miracle in their lives!

When the children picked up the knives and forks they had never touched before with trembling hands and ate the rich Western food, I don't know what they were thinking? Zhou Zuwang, director of the refugee orphanage, told me that he was thinking about what the children left in the orphanage were doing. It turned out that these 200 children were lucky ones who were selected by lottery. There are still more than a thousand children left in the orphanage eating black flour rations from "United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration" to spend Christmas. At the same time, he was also thinking about how the tens of thousands of beggars who were living on the streets and drinking the northwest wind were spending Christmas?

When Will Santa Claus Come Again?

Captain Fuchili of the USS Los Angeles and Captain Bai Lu of the USS Helena were very touched by the politeness and order of the children. In addition to their enthusiastic hospitality, they also personally waved goodbye from the deck.

At 4:00 PM in the misty drizzle, the children bid farewell to the giant cruisers. When the landing craft carried them across the Huangpu River, I believe every child who returned fully loaded would ask, "When will Santa Claus come again?" Who can give them a definite answer?

### Christmas Tidbits: Calendar and Picture Business Thrives; Dance Hall Tea Prices Multiply

The Christmas peak has passed. The wealthy are busy preparing for the New Year, and in another half-month, they will be busy preparing for the Lunar New Year. Busy coming and going, all for the sake of celebrating the New Year and festivals. Those struggling to make ends meet are worrying about not having rice to cook, so how can they care about the New Year or festivals?

On Culture Street, seasonal goods such as calendars, New Year cards, and pictures are doing the best business. Newly arrived American New Year cards are exquisite and beautiful, with prices starting at one thousand yuan and going up to three thousand yuan, and buyers are enthusiastic. Picture sales are highest among wholesalers near Shanghai. The pictures still mostly use "Investiture of the Gods," "Journey to the West," and Liu, Guan, and Zhang swearing brotherhood as backgrounds, with new-style additions including atomic bomb warfare scenes. Images of beautiful women emerging from baths are sure to attract attention and cause people to stop.

Yesterday, at major road intersections, people were distributing leaflets printed by the Tian'an Church Christmas Celebration Preparatory Committee, which read: "Today's people are filled with golden desires. Leadership desires are stirring up hands, creating waves, using brains, manipulating events. Their mouths sing of peace, but they plan for war. The full are full, the hungry are hungry. In this unequal situation, we Christians have a report: Today is

Jesus's birthday. Believe in this savior who atones for people's sins and establishes the kingdom of heaven, so that you can eliminate selfish desires, be reborn with love, and enter eternal life. Otherwise, we will all perish together. If you do not believe this, consider the above. The only turning point lies in believing in Jesus, because He is love. What people lack today is love."

For the past two days, tea prices in dance halls have increased five or six times or more. It seems that prices will not return to their original levels before the Lunar New Year. Commemorating festivals with price increases is the best indication of Shanghai's prosperity.

Yesterday, in the cold wind and rain in front of the Great World Guanshengyuan, there was a middle-aged man, dressed in thin clothes and barefoot, on the verge of death.

### Deadline for Reporting Traitors; High Court Has Not Received Orders

[Report from this newspaper] There is a rumor that the deadline for reporting traitors is the end of this year, and that prosecutors will not accept reports after the deadline. The reporter therefore visited the responsible persons of the High Court of this city and the Procuratorate of the High Court. According to them, they have not yet received the relevant orders.

### Sun Youquan and Others Indicted

[Report from this newspaper] According to news from the High Procuratorate: Sun Youquan, Huang Zhaoxin, Lu Tianyou, Deng Junshan, Tao Xuesheng, Zhu Shaochen, and other six people have been indicted on suspicion of being traitors. Cui Renwei and Zhuang Ningnian, two people suspected of being traitors, have not been indicted.

### Sun Chunsheng Case; Witnesses Questioned

[Report from this newspaper] Sun Chunsheng, the real estate tycoon during the enemy-puppet period, was further tried in the High Court yesterday afternoon, and witness Zhang Yifan was summoned and questioned. After the questioning was completed, the court ordered a retrial to be scheduled. The High Court also summoned Zhu Zhensheng, the former director of the puppet Qingpu County Hospital, and Cai A'gen, the former carpenter foreman of the Huasheng Tobacco Company. After interrogation, both were rescheduled for further questioning.

### Chen Mo's Jurisdiction Error; Transferred to the District Court for Trial

[Report from this newspaper] Chen Mo, who once served as the leader of the Vanguard General Team of the Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army and later became a businessman, was accused of taking a folding fan used by Emperor Qianlong from the home of rebel Liang Hongzhi. After the High Court concluded its trial on the 19th, it was announced in the High Court's Criminal Division 1 yesterday morning that the case had an error in jurisdiction and was transferred to the District Court for trial.

### Prison Visit Report; The Recent Living Conditions of More Than 500 Traitors

[Special Feature from This Newspaper] Amidst the rumors of a deadline for reporting traitors, let us take a look at the current living conditions of more than 500 traitors, both convicted and unconvicted, currently detained in Shanghai Prison:

Clothing: According to prison regulations, both convicted and unconvicted prisoners must wear prison uniforms. However, because the prison suddenly "welcomed" so many "honored guests" after the victory, there were not enough prison uniforms to distribute, so unconvicted prisoners were specially allowed to wear their own clothes. Therefore, they mostly wear suits, leather shoes, and long robes when they go to court for trial, and their families can send and exchange clothes every week.

Food: Each person has 20 taels of rice per day, divided into two meals. Because there are so many people, they are transported in batches to eat, from 8:00 AM to 11:00 AM and from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. The white rice is topped with vegetables, which is called "Gaijiao Rice" in the prison, but the general "rich traitors" have their families send canned food and fresh fruits every week to replace "Gaijiao Rice," and they ignore it.

Living: Zhongjian is a five-story cement building with a total of 374 prison cells. Because there are more rooms than people, some people live alone in one room, and some live together in pairs. At most, each room does not exceed three people. Except for the old and weak, no one is allowed to set up beds. Those "prominent officials" who used to sleep on "Simmons" sofa beds can only taste the taste of sitting and sleeping on the floor.

Movement: Prisoners living in small iron-barred rooms consider it an unparalleled enjoyment to be able to step out of the cell and walk around every day, calling it "liberation." Prison regulations stipulate that the cells will be opened at 7:00 AM, allowing them to stroll in the corridors or patios, or chat with friends in need. The cells are closed at 11:00 AM, and they are locked back into the cells. This is repeated when the cells are opened at 1:30 PM and closed again at 4:00 PM.

The "retired gentlemen" in Zhongjian spend their days in this way of life. They are not allowed to read outside newspapers, but they also know many news. When the verdict is determined, they will move to Xiaojian, at which time they must change into prison uniforms and can only visit family members once every two weeks, and they must also work. Fortunately, the workshops in the prison are well-equipped, with printing, canning, clothing, etc. According to their work performance, they can also earn some income every month. At this time, "ministers," "governors," porters, petty officials, and thieves are all mixed together, and there is no distinction of "class."

The hospital in the prison is well-equipped, and there is a special rubber room for people with mental illness. The reformatory is equipped with musical instruments for cultivating their minds. There are many literati and elegant scholars among the "retired gentlemen" in Zhongjian, so there used to be an organization of calligraphy and painting clubs where they composed poems and painted and studied each other. It is said that Cai Pei and others recite Buddhist scriptures and explain scriptures in their spare time, while Yuan Ludeng, Shen Siliang, and others gather with Christians every Sunday to hold worship services. Are they expressing repentance in the iron-barred years and prison life, or are they seeking spiritual liberation?

### Shen Siliang Case: Four Witnesses Questioned; Each Person Spoke Favorably; College Students Were Invited to Gather Around the High Court to Listen

[Report from this newspaper] The case of Shen Siliang, the former president of St. John's University, who was accused of holding a puppet position, was prosecuted by the High Procuratorate on suspicion of treason. The preliminary hearing was held on the 15th of last month. Yesterday afternoon, four witnesses, Ni Baochun, Yang Kuanlin, Huang Jiade, and Zhang Sumin, were questioned in the Criminal Division II of the High Court. The defendant was not questioned. Many professors and students from St. John's University came to court to listen yesterday, and several foreign professors also came. The inquiry lasted more than an hour before it ended. The statements of the witnesses are recorded separately below:

Ni Baochun

During his time as a professor at St. John's University, he and Shen Siliang both served as members of the Physicians' Committee. The task of the committee was to find ways to transport physicians and medical equipment to the rear to be used when the Burma Road was opened, and a contract was signed with the Southwest Transportation Office of the Military Affairs Committee in Hong Kong. A total of more than 20 doctors and more than 100 assistants were sent to the rear. After he left Shanghai and went to Kunming, Shen Siliang took over as the director of the committee until the Pacific War broke out and transportation was cut off. He also presented the original copy of the contract signed between the committee and the Southwest Transportation Office.

Yang Kuanlin

Dean of the School of Civil Engineering of the university, he stated that the defendant's assumption of a puppet position was entirely to perfunctorily deal with the enemy-puppet regime, and his purpose was purely to maintain the school. Because the Japanese were thinking of confiscating St. John's University's property, they had no choice but to falsely comply. Regarding the court's inquiry about the school hiring Japanese advisors Yoshitaka Sakamoto and Daikichi Tagawa, he stated that they were not advisors but two Japanese professors who taught economics and history courses, and never interfered in the school's administration.

Huang Jiade

Vice-Dean of the School of Arts and Sciences of the university, he stated that Shen Siliang's appointment as the president of St. John's University was due to the appointment of the school's board of directors. Most of the defendant's puppet positions were published by the enemy-puppet newspapers without consent. Because the enemy-puppet newspapers often published inaccurate news reports, he cited himself as an example. The Ta Kung Pao published that the plane crashed in Changxing and that he had died, but this was not the case. Moreover, St. John's University was considered by the enemy-puppet regime to have a long history, so all educational and cultural organizations were forced to assign a share, regardless of whether they agreed or not. Under the pressure of the enemy-puppet regime at that time, there was no other way to refuse except to close St. John's University. As for the Enemy Property Management Committee, it was to manage the property of St. John's University. Other puppet positions, except for the puppet Shanghai Municipal Consultative Committee, were said to be unclear. Another in-custody

Zhang Sumin

Testified that Zhang was the puppet Minister of Finance and Director of the Puppet Property Management Office. He stated that the office was entirely organized by Chinese people, and the Japanese transferred the so-called enemy-puppet property to the office for distribution. Because Shen Siliang was originally the president of the university, he handed it over to him for safekeeping, with the aim of protecting the property of the British and American churches. Shen Siliang did not have any title in the office, and no ceremony was held upon acceptance. Finally

### The First Case Involving Pre-War Deposits; Appeal of the Four Banks Savings Society Concluded

[Report from this newspaper] The first case involving the repayment of pre-war deposits, Chen Jilin's lawsuit against the Four Banks Savings Society, was judged by the District Court to be increased by a thousand times. The Four Banks Savings Society disagreed and appealed to the High Court. The lawyer representing the appellant argued two points in court: (1) The depreciation of legal tender is indeed a fact. Commodity prices have risen hundreds of times in the past year alone. If the payment must be increased due to the depreciation of legal tender, the social finance will be unimaginable. (2) The appreciation of bank real estate cannot be known for sure before liquidation. Reckless valuation is merely speculation and has no legal basis. The court announced the end of the debate, stating that the facts of the case were clear, and scheduled a date for the verdict.

### Citizens' Suggestions to the City Council: Improving the Treatment of Prisoners

[Report from Our Newspaper] The City Council has received over seventy suggestions from citizens in recent days. City councilors have also submitted over ten proposals. Today, a letter was received from a citizen suggesting improvements in the treatment of prisoners. Additionally, councilors Zhou Xiangsheng, Chen Gongda, and Qu Yue proposed that bail for accused criminals should primarily be secured with reliable business guarantees, rather than solely with cash deposits, to ensure that impoverished defendants are not disadvantaged. The contents of the citizen's proposal are excerpted below:

A letter from Leng Jun of Wuyi Road No. 101, requesting suggestions to all levels of the court: (1) Allow prisoners' wives and friends to visit the prison once or twice a month, and permit appropriate physical intimacy. (2) The prisoners' food and lodging should be improved to ensure an adequate amount of nutrition and hygiene. (3) During their sentences, prisoners should receive knowledge enrichment, with teaching staff from municipal schools voluntarily rotating to correct the criminals' thoughts and behaviors, thereby reducing social disputes.

### Rubber Shoe Manufacturing and Milling Industry Reaches Settlement

[Report from Our Newspaper] The work stoppage dispute between the city's rubber shoe manufacturing and milling industry and Runfeng Rubber Industry has been resolved through the mediation of the Social Affairs Bureau. A settlement record was established yesterday, with the following content: (1) All twelve workers in the rubber shoe milling department will be reinstated. (2) The wages for the period of the work stoppage will be subsidized by the department itself, amounting to 100,000 yuan per worker, for a total of 1.2 million yuan. (3) All workers will resume work from December 24th.

Defense Lawyer

Hong Shi stood up and stated: The defendant's protection of the school was his mission. In the four months before the victory, the Japanese still wanted to acquire the school's assets. If the defendant had intended to collude with the enemy and puppets, the school's property would not have been so well protected. Regarding the defendant's attendance at the puppet education administration meeting, the defense counsel inquired of Yan Shibian, chairman of the school board, who replied in a letter: At that time, it was very difficult for the school not to be enslaved, not to register, and to maintain its original state. If he did not attend the puppet education administration meeting, the school would be in danger of being closed. Therefore, the defendant attended under orders. He immediately presented a certificate letter. Subsequently, the defense lawyer Mi Xitong stood up and presented two letters from graduates of the school, thanking the defendant for supporting their studies during the enemy and puppet period. He also stated: When Shanghai fell, recruiting talent to send to the rear for work was quite dangerous.

### Tan Yuebo Sentenced to Three Years

Xu Jinlong and Lu Zhaoyuan Acquitted

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday morning, the High Court rendered judgments on two petty treason cases: (1) Tan Yuebo, former director of the puppet tax bureaus of Taizhou and Yangzhou, was sentenced to three years of imprisonment, deprived of public rights for three years, and his property confiscated according to law. (2) Xu Jinlong and Lu Zhaoyuan, accused of manufacturing military leather shoes for the enemy, were acquitted.

### Reporting Embezzlement in Takeovers at Any Time: The City Council Will Form Another Committee to Assist the Supervisory Office in Conducting Investigations

Local city councils, believing that the investigation team's work has a short time limit and the people's grievances are difficult to address, intend to request an extension to clarify malpractices and appease public opinion. They have submitted a request to the central government for approval. Subsequently, the chairman telegraphed: "Regarding unfinished work after the conclusion of the investigation team, it has been entrusted to the supervisory offices in each district to continue. However, if people or public opinion organizations in various regions continue to discover corruption in takeovers, they can still report it to the Supervisory Office and assist in its investigation." The Qingwu City Council is now specially organizing a takeover investigation committee to assist in the continued investigation to eliminate malpractices and promote righteousness, and has requested that the city council handle it uniformly. It is understood that the City Council has already submitted this suggestion to the joint meeting of conveners for review.

### Winter Relief Propaganda Committee Discusses Expanding Publicity Plan: First Meeting Held the Day Before Yesterday

The Shanghai Winter Relief Committee Propaganda Committee held its first meeting at the City Party Headquarters on Aitang Road at 3:00 PM on the 24th. Chairman Fang Zhi was in Beijing on official business, and Xie Renzhao, Secretary-General of the City Party Headquarters, acted as chairman. The chairman first reported, stating briefly: After the establishment of the Winter Relief Committee, relief work has been actively launched. The task of the Propaganda Committee is to promote publicity related to winter relief work. Today's meeting is to discuss expanding the publicity plan.

Funds Still Need to Be Raised Continuously

Subsequently, He Dekui, Director-General of the Winter Relief Committee, reported on the work of the committee since its establishment, stating briefly: The relief committee's shelter has been established, located on Tongzhou Road, with a planned target of 4,000 refugees. Currently, over 700 people have been accommodated, and another 400 or more can be accommodated in the next two days. The relief funds are budgeted at 100 million yuan, of which 40 million yuan will be allocated by the municipal government. It was originally planned to request 20 million yuan in assistance from the Ministry of Social Affairs, with the remaining 40 million yuan to be raised by the fundraising committee. However, since the Ministry of Social Affairs only allocated 60 million yuan, the fundraising committee needs to raise 54 million yuan to reach the planned target. To date, only over 15 million yuan has been raised (over 6.5 million yuan from broadcast fundraising, and over 8.5 million yuan from the fundraising initiated by Du Yuesheng, chairman of the fundraising committee, through the district people's representative conferences). A shortfall of over 38 million yuan remains, which must be raised continuously. The fundraising committee is scheduled to hold a dinner party at the Yituan Hotel from the 6th to the 11th of next month. The revenue from ticket sales is expected to be 20 million yuan. As for relief work, in addition to establishing shelters, rice distribution, porridge distribution, and relief teams for the poor will also be organized. At the same time, nearly 2,000 refugees from northern Anhui have fled to Shanghai. This committee has consulted with the Shanghai branch of the Executive Yuan to provide each refugee with a bag of Burmese flour, which will be distributed by the Anhui Association in Shanghai, and the association will be requested to send them back to their hometowns. At the same time, this committee will also provide flour to impoverished and unemployed comrades and family members of martyrs from the Anti-Japanese War in the city as relief.

Advocating Thrift and Saving Refugees

Proposals were then discussed, and resolutions were passed as follows: (1) The Propaganda Committee will invite reporters from various newspapers to visit the shelter. The date will be decided after consultation between the shelter and the Propaganda Committee. (2) Request the assistance of various newspapers in expanding the publicity of winter relief. (3) Adopt the work outline of the Propaganda Committee and designate responsible persons for each group. (4) Send a letter to the Central Film Studio and film companies requesting them to produce films about the lives of refugees. (5) Advocate saving on New Year's gifts and banquets and dedicate special celebrations to donating funds for relief, and suggest that the Winter Relief Committee issue "Relief for Refugees, Creating Fortune Vouchers" instead of purchasing gift certificates. (6) Send a letter to the Cinema Industry Association requesting them to produce refugee relief lantern slides for screening in various cinemas.

### Zhejiang Association to be Established Today

[Report from Our Newspaper] Preparations for the Zhejiang Association in Shanghai have been completed. It is scheduled to hold its inaugural meeting at the Ningbo Association in Shanghai on Xizang Road at 1:00 PM this afternoon to elect directors and supervisors. Additionally, [illegible] Monk will speak on the process of the Constitutional Conference, and Yu Biancheng will speak on current economic issues.

### Social Affairs Bureau Director Zhao Discusses Year-End Bonus Issues: Profit and Loss Vary Across Industries: Demanding Precedent is Unreasonable

[Report from Our Newspaper] Zhao Banfu, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, met with a reporter from this newspaper to answer various questions related to year-end bonuses. The main points are summarized as follows: (1) The year-end bonus for the city's six major public utilities has been determined to be one month's salary, and the labor force accepts this without issue. (2) The year-end bonus issue for the silk industry involves 40 factories and over 10,000 workers. Initially, the labor side requested a year-end bonus of two months, which the management side was unwilling to consider at all. After efforts by the Labor Affairs Office, the labor side conceded to the 28th, and the management side conceded to the 6th. Because the profit and loss situations of the various silk mills are different, Zhao suggested that those with surpluses assist those with losses to enable them to bear the minimum reasonable year-end bonus. This matter is still being handled. (3) If profitable businesses voluntarily issue year-end bonuses of more than one month's salary without labor disputes, the Social Affairs Bureau can ignore them. Zhao believes that the profit and loss situations of various industries are very different, and demanding precedent is unreasonable. He believes that the double-salary method is quite reasonable.

### Pudong Land Administration Embezzlement Case: Two Suspects Arrested

[Report from Our Newspaper] After inquiries by city councilors Tao Baichuan and others in the first session of the City Council regarding the Pudong High [illegible] District Land Administration embezzlement case, the case was investigated by the District Attorney's Office. It has been over two months since the investigation began. It is now known that Zhou Songqian, the main suspect in the case, who falsely claimed to be a "people's representative" and contacted the Land Administration Bureau to handle the return of civilian land forcibly confiscated by the enemy's Hengchan Company, taking the opportunity to defraud villagers of tens of millions of yuan, and another suspect, Ling Ansheng, have been arrested and detained by the District Attorney's Office. Therefore, the case is expected to have new developments in the near future. It is also learned that former Shanghai Land Administration Bureau Director Chen Shiquan will be subpoenaed to testify in court if necessary.

### Weather Forecast

### Social Services Reader Consultation

Legal Questions

(1) Believing False Accusations

Meimeng Zhuang asks: At the age of eighteen, Bo Ren left home to become independent because he could not endure the harsh treatment of his stepmother. Later, longing for home, he returned to the family, but unexpectedly, his stepmother's old habits returned, and he could not live in peace. Therefore, he recently left again. My father is weak by nature and believes his wife's words, claiming that he will publish a statement in the newspaper severing the father-son relationship. Although I did not obtain parental consent before leaving, I later sent a letter to my parents to express my apology and explain the reasons. I have not slandered the family at all. Moreover, I only took personal belongings when I left and did not take any household items. Is this statement valid? How should I deal with it?

[Lawyer Jiang Pingfan answers] The father-son relationship is a direct bloodline and cannot be severed by law. If a statement is published in the newspaper severing the father-son relationship, it is naturally invalid by law.

(2) Analyzing Inheritance

Wu Mao asks: (1) A marries B and has A. After B dies, A remarries C and has B. Now both A and B are adults, and A is also dead. Is C the legal representative of A and the legal guardian of A and B? (2) Does C have the full authority to inherit or dispose of A's estate alone? (3) When analyzing the estate, can C and A and B divide the estate into three parts? After C dies, is the estate inherited by B? Does A have the right to intervene?

[Lawyer Jiang Pingfan answers] (1) A is already dead, and his widow C cannot be A's legal representative. A, the son of A's former wife B, and B, the son of A's second wife, C, are both adults and do not need C to be their legal representative. or guardian (the so-called legal protector in the letter is probably the meaning of guardian). (2) C cannot explore to inherit or dispose of A's entire estate alone. (3) A's estate. It should be divided into three parts, with C, A, and B each receiving one share. How C and her son B dispose of the property they obtained has nothing to do with A.

### Tracking Down Missing Persons

### Dangerous Turbulence in the Financial Market: Newly Established Banks and Firms Bear the Brunt

Central Bank Authorities Express Opinions

[Report from Our Newspaper] In recent days, the financial market has been turbulent, especially the gold market, which has seen a sharp rise. However, as the Central Bank repeatedly sold [illegible] to stabilize the market, the market price finally collapsed, falling sharply again yesterday. Speculators were the first to be hit. As a result, the head offices of several newly established banks and money shops suddenly became tight. Especially those with more credit accounts or more customers suffered a sudden blow, and unstable phenomena occurred. There were as many as six rumors yesterday. Afterwards, they tried to make up for it or reorganize. The reporter specially visited Gao Yuesheng, Deputy Director of the Audit Department of the Central Bank, and asked him about the Central Bank's views on this matter. [illegible] said: The business operations of the financial industry in this city have always been directly [illegible] by the Currency Department of the Ministry of Finance. The Central Bank is also extremely concerned about the unstable phenomena in the financial industry. However, most of the new [illegible] banks and firms are branch offices in the interior. The regulations of the Ministry of Finance stipulate that if a bank or firm in the interior has been established for more than four years and its business operations are stable, it may establish branch offices elsewhere. It has been found that there are quite a few banks and firms in the interior that meet the requirements of the regulations. Therefore, a large number of new banks and firms have recently appeared in the Shanghai market. It has been found that many of these banks and firms often lack sufficient funds. Often, a start-up fee has already [illegible] all the funds, and they still need to bear some debts. [Illegible] many of these banks and firms are operated by laymen. They lack a comprehensive plan for banking business operations. Furthermore, banks and firms in this city usually rely on interbank lending to regulate their own head office surpluses and deficits. Once the financial market fluctuates, all banks and firms will shrink their head offices to maintain their own strength. Banks and firms that rely on interbank lending on a regular basis will inevitably experience fluctuations when they suddenly lose their support. Furthermore, it has been found that 19 out of 10 of the current deposits in banks and firms are demand deposits, which are extremely nervous and volatile. When the market fluctuates, these deposits become floating capital, flowing into the market [illegible] gold and U.S. dollars. Therefore, banks and firms with less qualifications, who usually rely on these demand deposits to allocate their head offices, are easily stranded at this point. The most [illegible] example is that in the past, each bank's [illegible] head office in the clearing house occasionally had insufficient funds and had to wait to be replenished, which was only tens of millions of yuan per day. Nowadays, it is not uncommon for the difference to reach 200 to 300 million yuan. Therefore, he hopes that after this wave of fluctuations, the financial sector should take a more stable approach as its guiding principle for future business operations.

It is also reported that as the end of the year approaches and the gold rush is encountered, speculators are fanning the flames. Some have made huge profits, but there are also many who have lost their balance and been dragged into the vortex and overturned. After Chengdai Silver Shop suspended exchange, Shunli Silver Shop announced its liquidation yesterday. In addition, five emerging banks experienced tense phenomena yesterday due to the sluggish turnover of their head offices. There were many rumors in the market about the grounding of the above banks. Therefore, the major [illegible] banks and firms are adopting a cautious attitude towards the allocation of their head offices. In addition, the Central Bank has been selling large amounts of gold in recent days, absorbing nearly 100 billion yuan in head offices, and the silver root in the market has suddenly tightened. The dark interest rate has been raised to 20%, but it is still difficult to borrow cash. Therefore, it is generally expected that in the situation of extremely tight silver roots, the price of gold will be difficult to be optimistic, and other prices will gradually return to parity.

### Interbank Lending Rate as High as 30% or More: Gold and Currency Market Prices Continue to Plunge

Yesterday, [illegible] suffered a general decline in the financial sector, continuing to plunge. It opened at 3.4 million in the morning, and after opening, it rose slightly to 3.43 million. Soon, those who lacked orders from silver and money shops came to sell, and the downward trend started again, breaking the 3.4 million mark. After 10 o'clock, the Central Bank distributed 40 bars at a price of 3.36 million, and people became even more panicked. Unstable news spread frequently, and it broke the 3.3 million mark. The news of the bankruptcy of a certain bank made the selling even more like adding fuel to the fire, without end. At noon, it even fell below 3.15 million, and then it stabilized slightly. In the afternoon, there were spot exchanges who were willing to sell at reduced prices, seeing a low price of 3.08 million. Deferred delivery opened from 3.17, gradually rose to 3.29 million, and was finally lowered to around 3.2 million. As a result, it fell another 230,000 compared to the previous closing. Jewelry gold was 345,000, and silver dollars also fell. The ordinary dark exchange rate was around 20%, and the head office on the day was even raised to over 30%.

Foreign currencies were also dragged down. Small U.S. dollars opened at 6,700 yuan in the morning and sold out, and then fell with the price of gold, falling below 6,200 yuan at noon. The afternoon was slightly stable, hovering between 6,200 yuan and 6,400 yuan. As a result, it fell another 400 yuan compared to the previous closing. Hong Kong dollars [illegible] was sluggish, starting at 1,350 yuan and falling to below 1,25 yuan. As a result, it also fell 120 yuan. Due to the Christmas holiday in Hong Kong, operators were only willing to supply at 1,300 yuan. Indian exchange rate was 1,480 yuan, and British exchange rate was 20,800 yuan. All were selling prices, and no transactions were made.

### Public Bonds Stagnant

Yesterday, public bonds still had [illegible] support, and miscellaneous brands were slightly [illegible]. The unified Series C opened at 1,390 yuan in the morning, and 360 houses came to sell, falling to as low as 1,330 yuan. Later, because 552 houses had replenishment, it rose back to 1,460 yuan, and then turned [illegible]. As a result, it rose 30 yuan each for Series A, B, and C compared to the previous closing. The unified Series D fell 50 yuan, and the unified Series E fell 100 yuan. The transaction was 3 million yuan.

### Five Securities Firms Illegally Trading: Ordered to Suspend Business After Investigation

The Social Affairs Bureau is actively cracking down on illegal transactions outside the stock exchange. It is learned that the Social Affairs Bureau, according to a letter from the Securities Exchange Supervisory Officer, stated that in this city, Cuifeng, Bingji, Yi Er Tai, Xinhua, Taifeng and other securities firms, as well as Bao Cheng Yarn Firm, were illegally trading outside the market. The Social Affairs Bureau immediately dispatched personnel to the police station to investigate and inspect the account books and trading situation. It was found that Taifeng, Cuifeng, Bingji, San Tai, Xinhua and other firms did indeed engage in illegal trading activities. Yesterday, they were ordered to suspend business, and the Public Utilities Bureau was notified to remove their telephones. All securities firms were instructed to make a guarantee to the Social Affairs Bureau that they would no longer engage in illegal transactions in the future. As for Bao Cheng Yarn Firm, it was found that there was no illegal trading activity, and the Social Affairs Bureau only asked it to sign a guarantee [illegible].

### Yarn Prices Continue to Fall

Yesterday, the yarn market was affected by the sharp drop in gold prices, and the customer base was weak. People in the industry were eager to supply, and the allocated yarn from product factories was sold at reduced prices. Therefore, 20 count yarn fell another 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. Double-strand yarn was in low demand and became even more sluggish, falling 70,000 to 80,000 yuan.

The Second Phase of Southern Transportation Ends at the End of the Month

It is learned that the second phase of Southern Transportation yarn and cloth began registration this month. As of the morning of the 24th, about 40 manufacturers had been approved, totaling 3,857 pieces of cotton yarn and 49,488 bolts of cloth. The total amount of yarn and cloth approved for Southern Transportation by the Textile Control Commission for this phase is 5,800 and another piece for cotton yarn and 125,492 bolts for cotton cloth. It is heard that the association will approve the total amount of yarn and cloth for Southern Transportation applied for by various manufacturers in this phase at the end of this month. If the total amount of yarn and cloth approved for Southern Transportation in this phase still has a surplus when the deadline is reached, it will be [illegible] combined with the third phase.

The Price of the Fourth Phase of Allocated Yarn Remains Unchanged

The price of cotton yarn for the fourth allocation to the replica industry in the fourth phase, textile factories have the intention of adjusting, but the Textile Control Commission has not reviewed it, so the allocation price must still maintain the old price and cannot be changed.

20 Count Double-Strand Yarn Resumes Listing

China Textile Construction Corporation uses 20 count double-strand [illegible] thread as the main raw material for [illegible] sailing industry. Since the joint allocation of yarn, this yarn has not been allocated. Now, in order to restore [illegible], it is specifically included, and its price is increased by 12.5% ​​according to 20 count single yarn, which is 1.965 million yuan per piece, and it has been notified to the replica cotton yarn distribution association to notify all colleagues since the 20th of this month.

### Viscose Rayon: Few Applicants for the Fourth Allocation

The Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association previously applied to the China Trust Bureau for approval to allocate viscose rayon blended [illegible] finished products as needed by various colleagues. After the Bureau approved it, each allocated household was issued an application card, and it was distributed four times a month. The association handled all the procedures for payment and application each time. It is learned that the fourth sale of this month is scheduled to open on the 27th. The deadline for payment by various colleagues is limited to noon on the 26th. Those who [illegible] do not pay on time will be deemed to have voluntarily given up. Currently, 19 companies, including Xinhua Public, have sent their registration cards to the association. There are still 46 companies that have not sent them. The association has notified various colleagues. According to the person in charge of the company, the end of the year is approaching, and colleagues have sluggish capital turnover, so those who have not sent them are probably unable to pay.

### Taiwan Sugar Falls Rapidly

Yesterday, as Taiwan sugar began to be available for delivery, the spot supply increased suddenly, and the price dropped sharply. The association divided the spot price of medium-grained white sugar to 138,000 to 139,000 yuan, the warehouse receipt to 135,000 to 136,000 yuan, the raw red sugar to 130,000 yuan to 129,000 yuan, and the October warehouse receipt to 170,000 yuan to 167,000 yuan. The spot prices of all fell by more than 20,000 yuan. Guangbang's [illegible] also fell by 10,000 yuan, to 123,000 yuan to 118,000 yuan, with more than 200 bags opened. Shantou’s [illegible] 125,000 yuan, with dozens of bags sold.

### Sugar Review Meeting Resolves: The Negotiated Price of Sugar Remains Unchanged

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Sugar Review Meeting was held at the Social Affairs Bureau at 3:00 PM yesterday. There were three important decisions: (1) The negotiated price of sugar remains unchanged, that is, 130,000 yuan per [illegible] for medium-grained sugar and 110,000 yuan per [illegible] for raw sugar. (2) In order to regulate supply and demand, it is stipulated that all [illegible] who buy raw sugar must also [illegible] buy an equal amount of medium-grained sugar; however, those who only buy medium-grained sugar do not need to buy raw sugar at the same time. (3) In the first sale of sugar, the remaining [illegible] certificates and insufficient sugar certificates in each district were uniformly distributed by the Civil Affairs Office. Now, because the procedures are too cumbersome, it has been decided to [illegible] change the method; that is, those with [illegible] certificates will be handed over to the Social Affairs Bureau by the Civil Affairs Office for cancellation. Furthermore, the price of sugar fluctuated once last week. In order to [illegible] lower the market price, Taiwan [illegible] Company specially increased the 28th issue of sales, which included: 28,500 bags of medium-grained sugar, 650 bags of [illegible] sugar, 3,300 bags of car white refined sugar, 2,000 bags of car white honey sugar, 20,350 bags of raw sugar, and 700 bags of red sugar. A total of 55,500 bags. Compared with the 17,550 bags in the 27th issue, it exceeded a lot, and the price of sugar became stable again.

### Chinese Stocks Encounter Another Predicament; Market Engulfed in a Downward Trend

Yesterday, the atmosphere of terror surrounding Chinese stocks intensified, and the market showed no signs of recovery, plunging relentlessly. The morning's opening prices were already low, with numbers 199, 215, 142, 122, and 61 failing to sell. Tih Yung Yarn even dropped to below 625 yuan. Later, the gold market stabilized slightly, and numbers 76, 224, 145, 4, 154, and 47 advanced, once recovering to 657 yuan. After 10:15 AM, the gold market weakened again, and numbers 89, 83, 85, 229, 99, and 61 were sold off. Numbers 232 and 198 saw some mid-course buying, but the gold price continued to decline. It was reported that a certain bank had lost 1 billion yuan and gone bankrupt. Numbers 229, 233, 83, and 154 were sold off again, and number 99 aggressively dumped raw yarn, finally breaking the 600 yuan barrier. Currently, Chin Hsing was the first to reach its limit down. Hsin Ho, King Lun, and Mei Ya followed suit, falling to their respective limits. Investor sentiment became even more fearful, further contributing to the gold market's decline. Near noon, Tih Yung Yarn briefly saw a low of 585 yuan. After numbers 14 and 47 bought in, the noon close stabilized, with Tih Yung Yarn, King Fuh, Hsin Kwang, and Wah Yat collectively falling by about 10%. Mei Ya, Hsin Ho, and Chin Hsing fell by 50%, Tih Chiao, Yung Fuh fell by 10%, Mei Ya, Wah Tung fell by slightly more than 5%, Hsin Ho and Hsin Kwang fell by 15%. Few cold stocks were traded, with King Lun alone falling by 50%. In the afternoon session, the market immediately dropped because the gold price plummeted to below 3.1 million. Numbers 186 and 215 were both sold for Tih Yung Yarn, which fell to 575 yuan. Numbers 124 and 212 bought in, and the gold market rose, recovering to above 610 yuan. Numbers 218 and 215 were both sold, and although there was a low recovery, due to numbers 177, 224, and 169 being sold off, it rose again to 616 yuan. However, the gold market fell again, and numbers 145, 89, 229, 99, 16, and 171 were successively sold. Tih Yung Yarn retreated again to around 580 yuan. Number 76 bought in near the close, and stabilized slightly after the low. As a result, compared to the previous close, Tih Yung Yarn and Hsin Ho fell by slightly more than 10%, Mei Ya, King Fuh, Chin Hsing and Hsin Kwang each fell by 15%, Wah Tung fell by slightly more than 5%, and cold stocks saw little trading. Very few transactions occurred for traded stocks, An Erh fell by a little less than 20%, King Lun fell by a little less than 50%, Dah Tung rose slightly, and the rest suffered setbacks. Tih Chiao Yung Yarn fell by 10%, Wah Zhuan fell by slightly more than 5%, and the rest fell by a little less than 15%. Off-market stocks also saw some decline.

Foreign stocks continued to decline yesterday, but investors provided some support at lower prices. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yi Sha, Ying Lien, and Hui De each fell by a little less than 10%, while the rest fell by around 5%.

### Raw Materials Can Only Last for One Month at Most; Silk Reeling Industry Will Shut Down Entirely; Hoping for Government Loans and Subsidies to Seek Swift Relief

Chu Fu-cheng, Chairman of the Silk Reeling Industry Association, met with reporters yesterday and stated: (1) The association has more than 150 members in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and the two cities of Nanjing and Shanghai. However, currently, fewer than 50 members are officially operating, and the raw materials of each factory can only last for one month at most. They will all shut down around the end of the lunar year, waiting for the new cocoons to be available in May of next year before they can resume operations. This is the main threat to the current weaving industry. (2) During this trip to Nanjing, he had the opportunity to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, who verbally promised that in addition to providing general relief, he also intended to include a subsidy for the silk reeling industry in the government budget for the coming year. This is because the export of silk is closely related to the government's foreign exchange and the livelihoods of silkworm farmers. Currently, Chinese silk in the U.S. market must suffer a loss of one-third per dan (unit of weight) due to competition with cheap Japanese goods. Therefore, if the government does not provide subsidies, the entire silk reeling industry will collapse. (3) Regarding the government's relief for the silk reeling industry, the Executive Yuan has ordered the China Silk Company and the Central Bank to negotiate an increase in the purchase price of autumn silk. A final decision has not yet been made, but it is around 60,000 yuan per dan. The China Silk Company has already allocated the last batch of autumn cocoons to various factories for contract reeling in order to maintain the livelihoods of the workers. As for loan issues, in addition to the already established reeling worker loans, which are loaned at 1.4 million yuan per dan, loans for machinery and equipment, with each reeling machine as collateral, are loaned at 2 million yuan and are still under negotiation. (4) The prosperity or decline of the silk reeling industry is of great importance to the entire national economy. Therefore, it is deeply hoped that the government can start by improving silkworm varieties and cocoon quality, and assisting various silk factories in purchasing the latest mechanical equipment in large quantities. This is because Japan can reel one dan of silk from 300 catties (unit of weight) of cocoons, while Chinese native cocoons require 600 catties to reel one dan of silk. At the same time, thorough improvement of mechanical equipment can not only increase the amount of vertical silk and improve silk quality, but also reduce the cost of silk reeling. Only in this way can it compete with Japanese silk in the international market, and only in this way can the entire silk reeling industry be thoroughly improved.

### Tea Merchants Plan to Petition Again, Requesting Government to Purchase Tea

The tea merchants in the city, in view of the imminent end of the year and the government's measures for purchasing tea not yet announced or implemented, are currently discussing emergency relief measures. They unanimously decided to send representatives to Nanjing again to petition. The delegation will consist of 21 people, with representatives from all tea-producing areas in the country participating, and led by Yu Jing, the former general manager of the China Tea Company. It is reported that various parties are separately discussing the date of the trip to Nanjing. According to semi-official sources, the Central Trust Bureau has determined the principles for purchasing tea, starting with green tea for the time being. Of which, Tunlu accounts for 70% and Ping Shui green tea accounts for 30%. The standards for purchasing tea are currently under study.

### Misfortune of Import Industry; Foreign Goods Ordered Previously Cannot Be Imported Within the Deadline; Requesting the Transportation Control Committee to Accommodate

The city's import and export commercial association, since the "Provisional Measures for Import Trade" were implemented, has found that all its members' orders for foreign goods, due to insufficient preparation in advance and no way to remedy it afterward, are in dire straits. Therefore, regarding the goods ordered before the announcement of the revised measures on the 17th of last month, the Transportation Control Committee notified all merchants to ship all goods to the port by the end of February next year. Upon hearing this news, the merchants were greatly alarmed. According to Zhou Jingwei, the secretary of the association, a portion of the goods ordered by the members are piled up at the docks of foreign countries and are currently waiting to be loaded onto ships. Another portion is still at various inland ports in the United States. Due to the lengthy U.S. maritime workers' strike, the docks and warehouses are full of goods ordered by various countries and cannot accommodate any more. Although maritime transport has now resumed, it will still take several months to transport all these goods. The goods that have not yet arrived at the coastal docks are even more problematic. The Transportation Control Committee's deadline of the end of February to ship them to Shanghai is, in fact, impossible. In addition to continuing to convene meetings of various members to discuss, they also plan to request the Transportation Control Committee to understand the merchants' suffering and provide appropriate solutions.

### India Increases Spring Cotton Export Quota by One to Two and a Half Times

[Reuters, New Delhi, 23rd] The Indian government has just announced the issuance of export licenses for 500,000 bales of cotton with a staple length of 11/16 inch and below for export during the January to April period. Merchants who exported to countries other than the United States during the export period ending December 1946 will be issued additional licenses, regardless of whether they have already received them, for a quantity that is 2.5 times the amount approved by the end of this December. As for licenses to the United States, they will be issued separately for a quantity equal to that approved during the period ending 1946. In addition, the quota allocated to the United Nations for the January to April period has been set at 125,000 bales. At the recent meeting of the 5th and 6th Textile Administration Bureaus, the urgent need to increase cloth production was discussed, and the possibility of adopting a three-shift system in various central areas was also discussed.

### Overseas Chinese Business Resumption Loans; Lending Begins in Burma; The Philippines and Siam Regions Are Still Under Preparation

The government's business resumption loans to assist overseas Chinese in reviving their businesses abroad are being handled by the Bank of Communications in the Burma and Philippines regions, with a total loan amount of US$5 million each. It is learned that lending has already begun in Burma, while the Philippines is still under preparation. However, due to the losses suffered in Burma during the Pacific War, it has not yet recovered and society is not yet stable. Therefore, the general business recovery still requires some time. The use of loans is minimal. The amount currently loaned by the Bank of Communications in Rangoon is very small, and most of it is real estate mortgage loans. As for the Philippines, loans require certification from our consulate, which is currently being processed. According to sources at the Bank of Communications, the Philippine branch has deposited funds in anticipation of the loans and can provide them at any time. However, according to general observation, the loan limit this time is too small, with credit loans limited to US$1,000 per household and mortgages limited to US$10,000. This does not provide much benefit to large merchants. At the same time, overseas Chinese in the Philippines are relatively wealthy and can generally order goods from the U.S. on credit and borrow from foreign banks at very low interest rates. It is expected that the number of loans issued in the future will not be large. The Bank of China is handling the business resumption loan of US$2.5 million in the Vietnam region. The branch in Siam has sent personnel to prepare and is negotiating with the local authorities in that country, as well as through diplomatic channels, to overcome the obstacles of Siam's foreign exchange control. The operations in Vietnam have been relocated to Saigon due to the conflict between France and Vietnam. They will begin as soon as the situation improves slightly.

### National Silk Processing for Export; Establishing a Joint Venture Company

Capital of 500 Million to be Established Soon

[Report from this newspaper] National silk processing for export is gradually becoming a reality. The city's silk weaving industry has decided to form a joint manufacturing and sales company with a capital of 500 million yuan. All silk mills can subscribe to shares, and national banks are welcome to invest as well. It is hoped that the company's preparations can be completed before the end of the old year. In the future, it plans to send personnel to various overseas markets to directly establish connections and not rely on foreign firms for sales. The issue of being solely responsible for profits and losses has been resolved after several consultations. The factories have agreed to bear the risks themselves, but losses are limited to 90% of the "labor cost," and sales income exceeding the agreed price will also be used as the profit of each factory.

### Silk Turns Weak Across the Board

Yesterday, the silk market was generally weak with few transactions. Artificial silk No. 120, Mount Takayama opened at 290,000 to 300,000 yuan with some transactions. The Toyo brand was trading at 420,000 yuan. There was not much change in the afternoon, falling by 140,000 to 150,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Semi-gloss persisted due to lack of supply, and No. 150 with gloss saw a high price. Jin San Ma small boxes of Li Sheng Chang were asking for 5 million yuan, six boxes were asking for 4.7 million yuan in the market. Spun silk was generally weak, grade B traded at 5.125 million yuan, and grade CD did not trade at all. Opening goods traded at 4.85 million yuan for high-end goods, more than 100,000 yuan less than the previous day. Silk goods were also weak due to the decline in raw materials. Hua Jin Crepe was asking for 750 yuan, but later only traded at 700 yuan, with no other changes.

### Galla Chinensis in Short Supply

It is reported that Galla Chinensis is in short supply at this port. Various export firms are directly purchasing from Hankou and transporting them to Shanghai for selection before shipping them for export. It is heard that local Shanghai product merchants are selling to export firms, with the price for delivery in Shanghai at 120,000 yuan per large package (i.e., net weight of one Sima dan), but there is an asking price with no transactions.

### Jin Rong Tightens Again

Jin Rong's situation is similar to that in Hong Kong and Macau. The price has risen sharply, and the goods in the market have also risen accordingly. Yesterday, the high-end goods in the market opened at 310,000 yuan, and the average goods opened at 280,000 yuan to 240,000-250,000 yuan. Because the inventory is not sufficient, and the winter sales season is approaching, the situation is very tight.

### Chinese Tea Sales to French Territories; Negotiations Have Begun

Chinese tea has always occupied a considerable position in European and American countries, especially sales to French Africa. Currently, there is a demand for Chinese tea abroad, but the selling price is not yet up to our country's production cost, so export sales are still not priced competitively. Local tea merchants, in view of the fact that Chinese tea is on the verge of extinction, have repeatedly appealed to the government for assistance, or to purchase it at cost, but so far there has been little concrete progress. It is learned that Lin Fengbao of the Central Bank's business authorities has discussed the various hardships of Chinese tea with the French commercial envoys for several months. As a result, hundreds of tons of tea, mostly premium teas such as Zhenmei, have been satisfactorily resolved. It is heard that the tea samples have now been deemed qualified, and the selling price has also been slightly increased compared to the past. It has also been designated to be shipped to various French territories in succession. Therefore, the various export firms in the city have gradually become active, but the industry is still not stable, and there is still no vitality in the domestic sales of black and green tea.

### Deliveries Come and Go in Succession; Cigarettes Fall in Price

Cigarettes, like shipments, come and go in succession, but buyers are watching and the market situation is weak and unable to improve. Yesterday, the initial market opened softly, and then slowly declined. Ten packs of British cigarettes per box fell by 110,000 yuan again. Among them, only 20-packs of Qianmen, Taishan, and San Wang were slightly lively, and the rest declined across the board.

### Hong Kong's Moratorium on Payments; Difficult to Lift Currently; Stock Transfer Ban; May Be Partially Lifted

[Reuters, Hong Kong, 24th] When replying to a member's question in the Legislative Council, the Colonial Affairs Minister Dodd said that the government has no intention of immediately lifting the moratorium on payments that was promulgated since Hong Kong's recovery. He said: "Regarding the issue of the moratorium and the relationship between debtors and creditors, the government cannot make further statements at this time." Although there is no immediate hope of lifting the moratorium, the possibility of canceling property transactions during the Japanese occupation period is being studied by the Colonial Affairs Bureau. Dodd continued: "Regarding the ban on stock transfers, the possibility of partially lifting it has also been suggested to the Secretary of State for approval, so that shares of companies registered by owners with the competent authorities will be allowed to be freely transferred, but shares of companies with disputes will of course not be included." Most merchants believe that the moratorium is somewhat hindering Hong Kong's economic recovery, and some parties have urged the government to lift the ban as soon as possible. Under the moratorium, all stock transactions must first be approved by the Minister of Finance, and disputes over past debts cannot be brought to court. The moratorium does not give banks the power to unfreeze pre-war accounts. The local stock exchange is still being rebuilt, and it is unlikely to resume operations until at least the ban is partially lifted.

### Transactions Are Slow; Coal Prices Drop

Coal industry transactions were slow yesterday, buyers were watching, and the elimination of various grades of coal was sluggish. The price of white coal from Yantai frequently dropped, Tangquan lump coal dropped by 50,000 yuan, and Jiaozuo lump coal dropped sharply by 70,000 yuan. Yantai lump coal and premium lump coal, premium lump general Yantai coal, all saw small declines. Firewood charcoal briquettes did not change.

### Australian Trade Representative Welcomes Indian Goods to Australia

[Reuters, Bombay, 24th] Mitcham, leader of the Australian trade delegation stationed in India, said: "Australian trade was previously monopolized by the Japanese, and we hope that India can restore its inherent position in the future." He assured that Australia would do its best to assist in the development of Indian trade.

### Ministry of Education's Border Education Work in the Last Three Years

[News from this newspaper, Nanjing] The Border Education Committee held its fourth meeting in Chongqing in January of the 33rd year. In the 34th year, due to the victory and recovery, the fifth meeting was not convened. During these three years, the country once entered the most difficult era, and the border education facilities in the capital had to adapt to the situation, support themselves through hardship, and slowly seek development. Generally, before the surrender of the Japanese invaders, the government, in order to cooperate with the Allied forces' counter-offensive, had urgent military needs, and border education undertakings were greatly restricted, such as the Border Administration Academy and the Lanzhou Language Training Class, which could not be established. However, border education is of great importance to national defense, and the Ministry of Education still strives to work within its available human and financial resources. In addition to the establishment of the Maritime Border School, the Lama Vocational School, and the Border Administration Department of the Central Northwest University as usual, it is also committed to improving the quality of existing schools. After the victory and recovery, border education undertakings became even more difficult. The maintenance of funding for various border schools in the rear area, the settlement of teachers' lives, the supply of teaching materials and equipment, etc., could not be interrupted, and the recovery work in the recovered areas must be advanced rapidly in coordination with the development of the new situation in the border areas. The 6th meeting will open on the 26th, and the Ministry of Education has prepared a report on the border education facilities in the past three years to be reported at the 6th meeting. The main points are as follows:

Directly Managed Enterprises (1) Science Departments and Middle Schools: In addition to the original Border School, the Ministry of Education established the Maritime Border School in the 33rd year in response to the need to recover the southeast maritime border. Recently, in response to the request of the local authorities in Xikang, it plans to change the Kangding Normal School in the province into a Normal College and is submitting a request to the Executive Yuan for instructions. In terms of middle schools, in addition to the Huangchuan and Hexi middle schools, which were once converted to border education, there is currently only one middle school in Yimeng. (2) Normal Education: There were originally ten normal schools in the border areas, three in southern Shaanxi, two each in Xikang and Gansu, and one each in Guizhou, Qinghai, Ningxia, and a normal class attached to the Yimeng Middle School. Recently, in response to the needs of the recovered areas, normal schools have been established in Rehe, Chahar, Liaobei, and Xinghua. The Tianshan Congling Normal School in Xinjiang is also in the process of preparation. The school system of the normal schools has undergone slight changes since the 34th year, and the length of study has been uniformly changed to four years. (3) Vocational Education: There are a total of eight vocational schools in the border areas, two each in Qinghai, Xikang, and Sichuan, and one each in Gansu and Ningxia. The departments are complex and mostly established according to local conditions: some focus on animal husbandry, some focus on agriculture and forestry, some focus on both agriculture and animal husbandry, some focus on textiles, and some have settings for medical affairs, veterinary medicine, and agricultural and animal husbandry production. The length of study varies from two, three, four, and five years, which is also determined by the special circumstances of the locality. In order to determine the school system of vocational schools in the border areas, the Ministry of Education has stipulated that all junior vocational schools in the border areas should be changed to a four-year system, and the curriculum standards are being drafted. (4) Primary Education: There are 17 primary schools established in Suining, Kangzang, and other places. Including the affiliated primary schools of the normal schools, there are a total of 34 schools. (5) Social Education: The Ministry of Education has always entrusted various schools to concurrently handle social education in the border areas. Each year, the Ministry allocates radios, projectors, and other equipment to allow the schools to organize mobile teaching drama troupes, etc., to conduct teaching tours in various border areas. Other promotional activities, such as running literacy schools for the masses and opening clinics, have also achieved considerable results in some schools.

Local Border Education (1) Various Provinces in the Rear Area: Various provinces have a considerable history of implementing border education, but in the past, they inevitably acted independently, and the manifestations were also different. In order to meet the needs of the border areas, the Ministry of Education has specially formulated a three-year plan (33rd to 35th year) for promoting border education in various border provinces. It has formulated standards for primary schools, social education, and vocational aspects, and ordered them to formulate implementation plans within the scope of possible funding and personnel, and submit them for approval. The provinces that have formulated the plans are Sichuan, Yunnan, Gansu, Ningxia, and Xikang. Due to special circumstances, Suiyuan and Qinghai provinces have only formulated the 34th year plan. Guizhou and Guangxi provinces have reported that there is no need to implement border education separately. Xinjiang has formulated an education administration plan because almost all education in the province falls within the scope of border education. Judging from the implementation results, the various border provinces have generally made efforts in the design and implementation of border education. Among them, Sichuan, Yunnan, Gansu, and Xikang provinces have achieved better results due to relatively abundant funding and personnel. Qinghai, Ningxia, Xinjiang, and Suiyuan provinces are lagging behind. However, due to difficulties in funding and teachers, the Mongolian Banner education is simple and crude in the primary schools established by each banner, and there is much room for improvement. There are no secondary schools. The Ministry of Education has allocated border education subsidies to various border provinces over the years to encourage them. In the 34th year, the Ministry of Education subsidized the funding for public and private schools in Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, Xikang, Sichuan, Yunnan, Xinjiang, Suiyuan, and Chahar provinces, totaling 2,294,000 yuan. This year, it has increased to 13,990,400 yuan, which is directly allocated to the schools for use. (2) Various Border Provinces in the Recovered Areas: During the enemy-puppet occupation period, the Northeast and Rehe Chahar Suiyuan Mongolia regions established a large number of schools to implement slave education in order to poison our border compatriots. At the time of recovery, affected by the war, the takeover was delayed, causing education in the area to fall into a standstill. In order to encourage local schools and quickly complete the recovery work, the Ministry of Education has specially promulgated the key points of emergency measures for banner education and ordered them to be implemented, stipulating that all primary and secondary schools and social education institutions in the recovered banner areas that have had considerable visibility in the past and have no teaching difficulties in the future should be restored by the province or banner government within the scope of personnel funding permits. In terms of funding, the Headquarters has repeatedly listed regulations and granted recovery subsidies: a subsidy of 3 million yuan for a senior high school, 2 million yuan for a junior high school, and 1 million yuan for a complete elementary school (same for social education institutions), and 600,000 yuan for a primary elementary school. In terms of teachers, qualified personnel should be hired, or short-term special training should be given to existing teachers and assigned to teach in various schools.

### Peking University Professors Urge Government to Improve Treatment as Soon as Possible

Plan to Request a Subsidy of One Ton of Coal per Person

They only urged the government to improve treatment as soon as possible and are currently requesting a subsidy of one ton of coal per person to alleviate the urgent need.

### Crisis in Overseas Chinese Education in Siam: Siamese Ministry of Education Orders Registration of Overseas Chinese Schools; Overseas Chinese Schools Unite in Refusal

[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 24th Dispatch] Overseas Chinese schools here have unanimously passed a resolution opposing registration with the Siamese Ministry of Education. If the Siamese authorities refuse to amend the existing education regulations promulgated by the former dictator, Luang Phibunsongkhram's government, the Overseas Chinese schools are prepared to close. The Ministry of Education recently ordered all Overseas Chinese schools to register within fifteen days. Upon receiving this news, leaders of the Overseas Chinese education community convened a meeting and resolved that Overseas Chinese schools would only register after the current Siamese education regulations were amended in accordance with the letter and spirit of the Sino-Siamese Treaty. The aforementioned treaty stipulates freedom of education for Overseas Chinese children here. Under the current Siamese education regulations, Overseas Chinese teachers must pass the fourth-level Siamese language examination. Officials from Overseas Chinese schools stated that Overseas Chinese children aged seven to fourteen are only allowed five and a half hours of Chinese language classes per week, and all Chinese textbooks must be submitted to the Siamese authorities for approval and translated into Siamese. Overseas Chinese education authorities have decided to make the following requests: (1) At least twelve hours of Chinese language classes per week. (2) Overseas Chinese teachers who do not teach Siamese language classes should be exempt from the Siamese language examination. (3) There is no need to translate Chinese textbooks for approval. These requests are the same as those recently made by our embassy in Siam to the Siamese authorities for negotiating amendments to the Siamese education regulations. It is understood that if the above requests are rejected, Overseas Chinese schools are prepared to close.

### Children's Concert: Grand Second Day

### Departments of Fudan University Compete to Establish Academic Lectureships

### Davis Cup Finals Begin

Predictions of Victory for the United States and Australia

[Agence France-Presse, Melbourne, 24th Dispatch] The Davis Cup finals are scheduled to begin here on the 26th. The singles lineup for the United States and Australia has been announced. On the 26th, there will be two singles matches: Bromwich (Australia) vs. Schroeder (USA), and Pails (Australia) vs. Kramer (USA). On the 27th, there will be one doubles match, with the lineup yet to be announced. On the 28th, there will be two singles matches: Bromwich vs. Kramer, and Pails vs. Schroeder. Australian fans believe that the United States' selection of Kramer and Schroeder is advantageous to Australia. The US Davis Cup captain's failure to select Parker to partner with Kramer is a mistake, as Parker has experience in the Davis Cup finals, while Schroeder is a newcomer. However, there is a rationale behind the US lineup, as Schroeder defeated Pails in the semifinals of the recent Victorian Tennis Championships, but lost to Bromwich in the final. Thus, Schroeder may win one singles match in the Davis Cup, while Kramer, whose skill level is above that of Schroeder, should be able to defeat Pails, so the US may win two matches. Kramer, the US champion, is evenly matched with Bromwich, the Australian international, so the results are difficult to predict. If Kramer wins, then with three wins out of five matches, the Davis Cup would be won, so the outcome is difficult to assess.

### Jinan in Twenty-Four Hours

— Special Correspondent Fan Litian of This Newspaper in Jinan

20th Air Mail

After the plane landed in Jinan, the first things that caught the eye were the countless strong fortifications and bunkers around the airport. The four square kilometers of the airport, two days ago (when the Jiaoji Railway had not yet officially opened), was still the only transportation line connecting Jinan with the outside world. More than 6,000 airplanes had successively transported all levels of civil and military combatants, supplies, both material and spiritual, ensuring its safety. This allowed the isolated city, with a width of fifty kilometers and a population of 800,000, to avoid catastrophe and stand tall, even under the hard and soft attacks of the Communist army from all sides. Bearing the brunt of this most arduous task was General Zhao Ziliang, the right-hand man of Commander Wang Zuomin, the current deputy adjutant of the buffer zone.

Second Generals Meet and Greet, Deputy Commander Li of the Pacification Zone

General Zhao and General Wu Litian are both old friends of the reporter. As early as the Shanghai Anti-Japanese War on August 13th, we hit it off immediately and became the most intimate friends on the battlefield. This time, they learned that the reporter had come to Jinan. Thanks to their warm hospitality, I truly felt "at home away from home" and "meeting an old friend in a foreign land," which made the reporter deeply appreciate the warmth and depth of friendship.

Generals Zhao and Wu first introduced me to Deputy Commander Li Xianzhu of the Pacification Zone, Chief of Staff Luo Xingli, and Director Long Zhouyun, among other senior officials. Deputy Commander Li is a famous general from the first class of Whampoa Military Academy, one of the "Three Lis of Shandong" (the other two being Li Yannian and Li Yutang). He is tall, with a round face, bright eyes, and vigorous spirit, but his temples are slightly gray, which shows his hard work for the country during the Anti-Japanese War. He personally participated in the famous battles of Xinkou in Shanxi and Fuyang in Anhui, and wrote many glorious chapters in the history of the Anti-Japanese War.

Deputy Army Commander Ma Talks About Whampoa Anecdotes

It was almost noon, and Li and others had lunch with the reporter. During the meal, we talked about the Communist army's disturbances in Shandong, and then moved on to "outwardly inept in foreign wars, inwardly adept in civil wars." Furthermore, Deputy Army Commander Ma Zhichao, who was also present, was an old member of the first class, and we talked about the interesting anecdotes when he first applied to Whampoa. He recounted frankly and candidly: At first, he felt that his level was too poor and was not sure of being admitted, so he first went to see the principal (i.e., Chairman Chiang Kai-shek) before the exam, and stated that the military academy was different from ordinary schools, and that applicants from remote provinces should be admitted more leniently. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek approved his request and wrote on his report: "Approved for special admission." When the exam came, Mr. Wang Boling was the chief examiner. Before the exam, Mr. Wang first announced three rules: those who are confident in their abilities should take the exam, and those who are not capable should withdraw themselves. Cheating is strictly prohibited, and the admission standards are based on performance. Any plea for leniency will be invalid. At that time, more than ten people automatically withdrew from the examination hall and gave up the exam. At that time, Mr. Ma was not moved at all. When he came to the mathematics and science questions, Mr. Ma could not answer any of the questions and handed in a blank paper. He was deeply afraid of failing, so he had to write to Wang Boling, pleading his hardships, and then threatened: "If I am not admitted, I will only risk my life." Wang was timid, and as a result, he was indeed admitted!

The Big Cannon Wang Boling Scares People to Death

When Ma said this, he still couldn't help but feel emotional. Deputy Commander Li then added: "Wang Boling has always been known as the 'Big Cannon Wang,' but although he is called a 'Big Cannon,' he is the most timid. Wang once said to others: 'People call me a "Big Cannon," and I am indeed a "Big Cannon," but as long as I hear a cannon sound, I will be frightened!' The audience burst into laughter.

Ma is good at rhetoric and humorous in nature. He also talked about when he was a regimental commander in the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, he and his classmate Chen Defa went to see Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. After Chairman Chiang Kai-shek invited them to dinner, Ma was deeply afraid of staying too long, or having shortcomings that could be easily discovered by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, so he immediately asked Chairman Chiang Kai-shek for instructions on what instructions he had for them to lead troops to fight. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek thought for a moment, and then said: "You two are leading troops, but Chen Defa's name alone means 'not effective.'" After Ma resigned, he greatly complained about Chen Defa, that if it wasn't for his name, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek might not have thought of this "comment." Chen is currently the commander of the Dihua Garrison, and it can be said that he has already become "effective."

After the meal, Deputy Commander Li and others were busy with meetings, and the reporter was invited by Deputy Director Wu of the Shandong Public Newspaper and others to visit the six newspapers, six news agencies, and six periodicals here. In addition to the Central News Agency, news agencies here, such as the Chunqiu News Agency, can also send manuscripts on a daily basis, so that the newspaper's external affairs are in a state of "no competition." The sales volume of the newspapers ranges from 3,000 to more than 10,000 copies. In Jinan, which is like a besieged city, under the circumstances that all material conditions are lacking, it truly symbolizes the hard-fought spirit of the news industry.

Chairman Wang Works Diligently, Only Sleeps Four Hours a Day

At 5:00 p.m., Chairman Wang Zuomin invited me to a banquet. Since Mr. Wang took office as the chairman of the provincial government, he has been so busy that he can only sleep four hours a day, and even in these precious four hours, he is constantly disturbed by the telephone. We have been apart for six years, and the first feeling is that although Mr. Wang is diligent and hardworking, under the arduous task of tying the safety of Shandong to his own shoulders, his eyes are still bright and his physique is strong, as in the past. This shows that the prerequisites for making great achievements and achieving great undertakings are not only the combination of wisdom, benevolence, and courage, but also a strong physique, which is the prerequisite among the prerequisites. Although Chairman Wang has been entrusted with important tasks by the country today, his sincerity and earnestness in treating people, and his seriousness and meticulousness in handling affairs have not changed slightly due to his high position. During the dinner, Chairman Wang mentioned that when we first met, he was just a division commander, but the reporter for the past ten years is still just a reporter. Compared to this, how can I not be ashamed? However, Chairman Wang is still as frank and sincere as in the past, and is full of care, which is the only consolation for the reporter to be a reporter.

Four Dishes and a Soup, Meeting Reporters During Dinner

Because Chairman Wang is too busy, he can only use his dinner time to meet with reporters. The meal is four dishes and a soup. Today, because there are also ten people present, including Deputy Army Commander Li Yan, the plates and bowls are larger, and four more plates of porridge and side dishes are added. Everyone eats comfortably and practically. During the meal, Chairman Wang asked me many questions about the situation in Beijing and Shanghai, which made me have no time to ask him about the military and political situation in Shandong. At the end of the meal, Secretary-General Liu Daokang of the Provincial Government had been waiting in the meeting room for a long time, so the reporter had to reschedule to ask Chairman Wang to explain the current situation in Shandong.

Chairman Wang's residence is the former German consulate in Jinan. When the reporter stepped into his residence in the deep night, the streets were bustling with people coming and going, and the night markets were the same as in the past. Except for the fortress at the street corner and the barbed wire fences made of iron thorns every few tens or hundreds of steps on the road, and the iron thorn wooden frames that can be electrified standing under the bright street lights, more or less revealing a bit of wartime atmosphere, the entire city of Jinan is still quietly lying at the foot of Sili Mountain and Ma'an Mountain.

The Jinan that I encountered in twenty-four hours was really too little. Let's use this as a wedge for future communications.

### Abundance by the Banks of Poyang Lake

— Special Reporter Yu Ningpo of This Newspaper

Poyang, 6th

French economist Gurney said: "The wealth of a living individual, that is, the wealth of an animal body, is its blood, and the wealth of a social body is its objects." Objects refer to agricultural products, because agricultural products can be extracted from the outside world, which can increase the wealth of the social body. In other words: if a country, a province, a county, or a township has the wealth of a social body, then the economy and taxation of a country, a province, a county, or a township will have laid its source and foundation.

The reserves of agricultural crops in the counties along Poyang Lake in northern Jiangxi Province possess the conditions for the above-mentioned social wealth. Together with the five major tributaries of the Gan River, Fu River, Xiu River, Xin River, and Rao River, they can be said to be the pride of Jiangxi's production sector and the granary of the entire province's agricultural products. In the southeastern provinces, Jiangxi is known as a prosperous area, relying on Poyang Lake and the five major production areas of the Gan, Fu, Xiu, Xin, and Rao rivers as its strongest pillars.

Today, the reporter will make a brief report on the production and sales of the most prominent agricultural crops in the counties along Poyang Lake in northern Jiangxi this year, such as rice, indigo, sugarcane, lotus seeds, cotton, and tobacco. But when I started to write this dispatch, the great lake was deeply imprinted in my mind, containing a lot of envy - envying it for being able to nurture so many food and clothing materials that are beneficial to human life. Therefore, for each product along the lake, I specially highlight its function and purpose, not just calling it an object, so that it can be matched with the dynamic and static lake water, and further show its infinite greatness.

Southeastern Granary, Famine Years Do Not Hear of Empty Stomachs

The counties of Raohe, Changjiang, and Yuejiang in northern Jiangxi Province are located on the shores of Poyang Lake, with fertile plains and convenient irrigation, making them the most suitable areas for cultivation. As the old saying goes, "When Jiangxi is ripe, the southeast is sufficient." This is indeed true. According to the Jiangxi Tongzhi (Jiangxi General Records), in the early Qing Dynasty, there were more than 47,827,000 mu of rice fields in the entire province. In the 20th year of the Republic of China, the statistics office of the Legislative Yuan estimated that there were more than 41,630,000 mu of rice fields in the entire province. The Economic Commission of the Provincial Government estimated that there were 52 million mu of farmland in the entire province, of which an average of 65% could be planted with rice. The annual yield of rice per mu, calculated by combining one to two harvests per year, can produce at least 132,158,000 shih of grain in a bumper year. In the 25th year of the Republic of China, the statistics office of the provincial government, based on reports from 83 counties, totaled more than 119 million shih of early rice, middle rice, late rice, and glutinous rice. In addition to supplying the people of this province with food and sales, more than 2 million shih of rice can be left over each year, of which one-third of the surplus comes from the warehouses in the counties along Poyang Lake. According to the estimates of the Economic Commission of the Jiangxi Provincial Government in the 22nd year of the Republic of China, the amount of rice ceded in the counties along the lake was 2,780,000 dan in Yugan, 982,800 dan in Wannian, 1,338,750 dan in Yujiang, 418,335 dan in Xingzi, 1,514,852 dan in Duchang, 647,516 dan in Hukou, 4,466,900 dan in Poyang, 1,656,608 dan in Fuliang, 1,946,580 dan in Leping, and 756,000 dan in Dexing. In the 24th year of the Republic of China, the amount of rice produced in the Raohe area was 3,309,600 dan of early rice, 997,600 dan of middle rice, 1,912,200 dan of late rice, and 277,200 shih of glutinous rice, totaling 6,496,600 shih. With one-eighth of the province's corner, the ten counties bordering the lake have so much rice production, it is truly worthy of the name of granary.

This year, although the early, middle, and late rice in the counties along the lake once faced the danger of being flooded by white water in the summer, most of the basic dikes did not break. After a long sunny autumn, the rice fields turned danger into safety, and the autumn harvest was generally bountiful. The harvest of Wannian rice is more than double that of a bumper year. It is estimated that the average rice production in the counties along the lake has sufficient harvest. Self-reliant farmers, they have exhausted their labor and sweat, and exchanged them for cars and warehouses full of golden rice grains, so that the men, women, old and young who live and eat here can all have full bellies and live a peaceful life of abundance and prosperity. In times of famine, the surplus can be used to make up for the deficiency. The so-called fierce year does not hear the crying of hunger, and the winter plowing will stop in a blink of an eye, which is the leisure time for them to rest. Try to look at the farmhouses on the lakeside, where three or four farmers gather on a cold night, smoking and roasting fire, and talking about sericulture and hemp, and start their fireside chats.

Coloring the Sky Blue, Adding Beauty to Green Robes

Indigo was introduced to our country from India thousands of years ago, and it is the oldest colored plant among dyes. Leping, upstream of Poyang Lake, is adjacent to the lakeshore, with a mild climate, deep soil, and non-wet clay soil, making it the most suitable area for planting indigo. Indigo belongs to a kind of blue grass, divided into Polygonum tinctorium and Isatis tinctoria. The indigo made from Polygonum tinctorium is bright and shiny at first glance, but it will turn green after a long time and gradually lose its dyeing ability. The indigo made from Isatis tinctoria looks dull and has the color of Annam. The indigo paste can remain colorfast for several years.

In the past, the output of Leping indigo was about 400,000 to 500,000 market stones per year, with Polygonum tinctorium accounting for one-third and Isatis tinctoria accounting for two-thirds. The total area of indigo planting in the county is 300,000 to 400,000 mu, with about 200,000 indigo farmers. The yield of indigo per mu is 1.5 to 2 market stones for Polygonum tinctorium and 2 to 3 market stones for Isatis tinctoria. Before foreign indigo invaded domestic sales, Baolan, Yuelan, and Qinglan earth cloth, which were manually woven in the mainland, were all dyed with local indigo. At that time, there were more than 70 Leping indigo dyeing workshops, with more than 100 technicians in the large ones. This was the golden age of the Leping indigo industry. Since the import and sale of foreign indigo, users have used it because of its low price and labor-saving, and the original local indigo market has become narrower and narrower. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, foreign indigo was cut off, and the demand for local indigo was revived, and it gradually rose again. Last year, the local market price per 100 catties soared from 3,000 to 4,000 to 70,000 when leaving the customs, and indigo farmers and indigo merchants all benefited greatly.

This year's harvest of indigo in Leping is expected to be more abundant than in previous years. Although the price has fallen in recent months, it is still hovering between 50,000 and 60,000, and there are still sales in various places such as Tianjin, Shanghai, Suzhou, Hangzhou, and Xun Province. Farmers who plant indigo know that the previous year's income was abundant, so they only know to give full play to the land and then wish for extravagance. Every time the indigo seedlings mature in late autumn, wooden barrels are arranged by the river, and the sound of stirring indigo is heard. They have a spirit of starting work and enjoying their careers, which is expressed in the smiles and words of every indigo farmer. The naturally beautiful blue gowns worn by the simple and unpretentious men and women in the inland rural areas are all exchanged for their strength and sweat.

Sweet as Honey, Symbolizing Cultural Progress

Jiangxi Province is an important sugar producing area in our country, and the producing areas are almost all over the province, especially the old Ganzhou and Raozhou prefectures. Leping and Dexing, upstream of Poyang Lake, have a wide area for planting sugarcane. Sugarcane is the best raw material for sugar production. In the sugarcane producing counties in the irrigation area along the lake, there are Poyang, Fuliang, Wannian, Leping, and Dexing. Among the above five counties, Leping has the richest sugarcane production. Leping sugarcane has long and sweet stalks. The sweet sugarcane produced in the Raohe area is mostly named Leping sugarcane.

The total planting area is 7,350 mu of sugarcane fields in Leping, 520 mu in Wannian, 1,000 mu in Poyang, 5,438 mu in Fuliang, and 4,200 mu in Dexing. The annual output of Leping is 553,000 dan, Wannian is 43,000 dan, Fuliang is 190,330 dan, Poyang is 60,000 dan, Wannian is 22,500 dan, and Zongxing is 13,400 dan. In the 16th and 17th years of the Republic of China, there were more than 70 local sugar factories in Leping and Dexing. The value of sugar exports was no less than 800,000 yuan. The annual output of sugar in Yujiang was 90,000 dan, and Wannian was 20,000 dan. The total output value of the total exports was slightly more than Leping. The produced sugar is all of the two types: red sand and dry block. Although a large amount of foreign sugar is dumped in the mainland, because of the different red and white quality and taste, red and white each have their own sales channels. During the recent Anti-Japanese War, the source of foreign sugar was cut off, and mainland users replaced it with cane sugar, and sales increased year by year, and prices also rose. Ten years ago, the market price of cane sugar per dan was only 7 or 8 yuan to 15 or 16 yuan. Last year, it had soared to 50,000 to 70,000 yuan.

This year, farmers in the producing areas have benefited greatly from sugar, and they are all engaged in large-scale production. The sugarcane harvesting has already started in the last ten days of last month, and it will be completed this month. The output has increased compared to last year. Various sugar factories are preparing to set up cars for boiling, and the old sugar in the sugar households has long been scarce. Most of them are rushing to put new sugar on the market. The current market price of old sugar is 90,000 for true grade, 85,000 for red sand, 60,000 for raw water red sand, and 30,000 for leaky water. In the future, the market price may still increase.

In the past seven or eight years, the popularity of sugarcane production and sales has been a great source of profit for sugarcane farmers. In addition to the daily consumption of cane sugar as fruit, many foods are made with sugar, which seems to symbolize the leisurely and sweet life of the people in the sugar producing area, and the theory that civilization and things go hand in hand: "The countries with the most consumption of sugar are also the countries with the most cultural progress." In this way, it not only increases the wealth of the local area, but also promotes the progress of local culture.

Fragrant Red Lotus Roots, Lotus Coins Spread All Over the Lake

Poyang has mostly plains and rich lakes and marshes. Farmers adapt to local conditions and plant lotus on a large scale. The output of lotus seeds is also the most abundant, which is the main source of income for Poyang farmers' side business. The lotus produced in Poyang is no less than that produced in Hunan. The grains are large, the powder is thick, and the quality and taste are excellent. Lotus is divided into red and white, with red being more common and white being of better quality. The land and lakes are all alluvial mud, which is wet, loose and fertile, making it easy to plant lotus. Farmers do not spend much effort to plant them at will, allowing them to grow naturally. After the lotus seeds are ripe and harvested, the lake water dries up in winter, and the lotus roots continue to be dug up, either as vegetables or made into lotus root powder, which are all called delicacies. The market price of Poyang lotus before the war was only 20 to 30 yuan per dan. In recent years, the price has gradually increased. Last year, the selling price in the producing area was 90,000 to 110,000 yuan. This year, the new white lotus has risen to 180,000 yuan in recent months, and it is exported to various ports such as Shanghai, Suzhou, Xunhan.

What lake lotus is most afraid of is the flooding of white water, which damages the lotus stems. If the stems are broken, they cannot grow lotus pods, and the seeds will wither. If there is no flood year, the production will be a bumper harvest. Especially when the lotus stems are strong and the lotus leaves are full, the red and white buds are blooming in the morning and evening, setting off a natural colored picture. If you have read the article "On the Love of Lotus", and you go to see the graceful lotus pods and fragrant lotus roots in the lake, and the fun of fish playing with lotus coins, you will feel the same love as Zhou Dunyi!

Clothing and Blankets for the People, Keeping Out the Cold is Worthy of Silk

The counties in Raozhou, northern Jiangxi, are alluvial lands by the side of Poyang Lake, making them the most suitable areas for cotton cultivation. The area of cotton planting in the entire province is also the largest in counties such as Duchang, Poyang, Yugan, Wannian, Hukou, Leping, and Fuliang. Most of the cotton varieties are medium cotton, with two types: white seed, black seed, and smooth seed. The best quality is Hukou white seed cotton, which is the best variety of cotton in the province, and it also occupies a considerable position in the domestic medium cotton grade. The Shanghai-Hankou market calls it Jiujiang cotton, which belongs to this cotton. Its characteristics are strong development and rich production. The harvest of seeded cotton per mu is valued at 110 catties to 200 catties. Only because the fiber is short and coarse, it cannot spin cotton yarn above 20 counts. The other 1 to 8/5 inches can only spin 8 to 16 counts of cotton yarn. Compared with the quality of improved American cotton varieties in other provinces, it is far behind.

In the past, the sales channels for cotton, such as Jiujiang and Hukou cotton, were mostly purchased by the Jiuxing Yarn Factory in Xun City. Most of the rest is for self-use or for inland handmade weaving. According to the statistics of the Jiujiang Customs, the output of Jiangxi cotton was the largest in the 19th year of the Republic of China, totaling 70,809 dan, which is almost one percent of the output of cotton in Shaanxi, Hubei, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang provinces.

Generally speaking, the cotton production in each county this year is still considered to be abundant. However, although the area of cotton fields has increased compared to before, the development is not long due to excessive rainfall this summer. After autumn, the weather is dry, and the late development of cotton crops is slightly hindered. Compared with the first estimate, it is slightly inferior. With the increased planting of cotton fields in various places, the average production volume should not be less. When the new cotton was put on the market this year, the market price of seeded cotton per catty from flower vendors ranged from 600 to 1,000, which is equivalent to 245,000 yuan per dan of lint cotton, which is ten times higher than last year. In recent months, due to the increase in prices, the Hujiang flower market has opened at 170,000 to 190,000 yuan, and flower sales have become bleak. Cotton farmers are also holding back the harvested flowers and not selling them.

Their original purpose of planting cotton is first for self-use. If the sales are good and the price rises, they will sell the surplus. If the sales are sluggish and the price falls, they will store all of them for the need for cotton-padded clothes and quilts at any time. Women who can spin yarn spin yarn, those who can weave cloth weave cloth, and those who cannot spin or weave exchange flowers for cloth. They only seek to keep out the cold and do not admire brocade clothes. No matter how the price of cloth on the market is rising, they are simply not affected in the slightest. It has the style of Mahatma Gandhi, self-planting, self-spinning, self-weaving, and self-wearing, which is a self-reliance doctrine that does not seek help from others. As for silk and woolen fabrics, they are even farther away from them, and they never have a clothing relationship with them. "Coarse clothes are warm, and vegetable roots are fragrant, and the taste of production is long," which seems to be a true portrayal of their real lives.

A Wisp of Smoke, Revealing a Different Fragrance

The tobacco producing areas in Jiangxi Province include Nanxiong, Ruichang, Jinxian, Ruijin, Guangfeng, Duchang, and Poyang. The quality of tobacco in Nanxiong and Ruijin is the best, followed by Poyang, and then Duchang. Duchang has a relatively large area for planting tobacco, which is the largest source of income for rural side businesses. Before the war, the total value of Jiangxi tobacco exports was more than 3 million yuan per year. Farmers plant tobacco in varying amounts, mostly planted in the gaps in the plains. The planting procedure is to scatter the tiny tobacco seeds for planting in March and April of the lunar calendar. After using soybean cake as fertilizer and mixing it into the mud of the tobacco fields, cultivate it once to build a strip of soil ridge. After a certain period of time, transplant the tobacco seedlings onto the tobacco fields. In May and June, the tobacco will grow, and after a short time, it can be harvested. The harvesting process of tobacco leaves has two phases: "Fu leaves" and "Autumn leaves". The quality and taste of Fu leaves are better and the price is more expensive. The harvest period is in the hot summer weather. Autumn leaves are harvested in the autumn period, the quality is inferior, and the price is lower.

Now that prices are rising, the selling price of tobacco silk is more than 100 yuan per gram. Farmers have a deep fondness for tobacco, which is a good companion that they cannot live without during their field operations. In order to avoid the outflow of profits, tobacco farmers in the producing areas mostly use their own tobacco leaves to make tobacco silk themselves. They plant, make, and smoke themselves. Their tobacco pipes are all made of bamboo roots, with a tobacco pouch attached, and they are usually inserted in the waist. Whether they are idle or busy, they cannot be without this gentleman for a moment. Occasionally, they hold it to offer guests to taste, and a wisp of smoke reveals a different fragrance. The relaxing function of this "Acacia grass" is no less than "tea as wine when guests come on cold nights."

### Taiwan's Top Ten Shipping Routes

— Special Correspondent Jiang Muyun of this Newspaper

Hualien Port, 11th Day News

The Taiwan Province, taken over from the Japanese, experienced unbearable quiet scenes for several months this spring. The chaotic crowding and delays are still unforgettable. However, this was only a temporary transition. Over the past six months, the urgent improvement and reorganization of transportation have shortened the distance between Keelung and Kaohsiung ports to the mainland. At the same time, the people of this province deeply feel that only thanks to the rapid recovery of transportation can Taiwan truly become a province of China in name and in fact.

The most significant achievement is the restoration of railway transport capacity to 100%. Initially, 60 trains were running daily, now it has reached 120 trains. In terms of highways, the main lines maintain one trip per day, four trips a day on crucial routes, and the most important ones can reach one trip every five minutes, like the Taipei to Keelung line. As for the port clearing work, 50,000 tons of sunken ships have been salvaged in Keelung and Kaohsiung. Among them, nine have been landed, and two in Keelung and three in Kaohsiung are still being salvaged. The wartime scene of the ports can no longer be traced.

In a hotel in Hualien Port during his trip, this reporter interviewed Director Ren Xianqun, who controls the lifeline of the new Taiwan's transportation, for half an hour. He told the reporter: From January to June next year, eight domestic and foreign shipping routes will be established. In addition, two routes that must be completed in the second half of the year, making a total of ten major shipping routes, including:

(1) Taiwan Eastern Line: From Keelung to Suao, Hualien Port, Taitung, Green Island, Orchid Island, Kaohsiung, and Penghu in the east, using 500-ton ships, starting in January.

(2) Taiwan, Xiamen, Fuzhou triangular shipping route.

(3) Shanghai Line: This is a scheduled transport, and it has been decided that three ships will take turns sailing, once every ten days. One of them can arrive in 36 hours.

(4) Qingdao, Tianjin Line, twice a month in January.

(5) Shantou, Hong Kong Line, twice a month in January.

(6) Wenzhou Line.

(7) Yangtze River Line, directly to Hankou.

(8) Dalian Line, will be opened as soon as the situation stabilizes.

(9) Philippine Line.

(10) Singapore Line.

(9) and (10) are scheduled to start in the second half of the year. In addition to the imminent railway, the establishment of a provincial airline is also planned, and air transport in this province can be restored next year. These are all actively unfolding under two policies: The main focus is on political significance and increasing provincial revenue—encouraging travel to Taiwan; The second is to decide that Keelung will become a purely trading port, with all foreign goods transshipped from that port to various parts of South China; Kaohsiung Port in the south will become the focus of transportation to the mainland and Southeast Asia! Currently, Keelung's warehouse capacity has been expanded from 20,000 tons to 80,000 tons, and is expected to reach 200,000 tons by the end of next year. Kaohsiung Port will increase from 45,000 tons to 150,000 tons, and general travel facilities are also being designed.

In Taiwan Province, where manpower and resources are quite difficult, Director Ren deeply understands the difficulties he must encounter in order to complete these ten shipping routes as scheduled. But he said frankly and firmly that there is no other way but to overcome difficulties. He further pointed out that the current favorable conditions for the shipping industry in this province are low prices, simplified procedures, and a "supply exceeding demand" situation that is exactly the opposite of the mainland.

Director Ren firmly believes that with his spirit and experience in reorganizing transportation in the past six months, maritime transportation will not be a problem next year. Because this will not only prosper this province, but also strengthen the centripetal force of the isolated Taiwan Province towards the mainland. The voyage between Taiwan and the mainland has been shortened! Keelung and Kaohsiung will also regain their previous glory in world trade and transportation!"

### Fire in Kowloon Relief Goods Warehouse

— Special Correspondent Zijian of this Newspaper

Kowloon, 18th Day News

The warehouse set up by the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA) on Chatham Road, Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon Peninsula, opposite Hong Kong, suddenly caught fire at 10:30 pm on the 17th, burning for an hour and a half.

The Hong Kong Navy and Army also dispatched personnel to assist in the fire fighting, because in addition to the CRRRA warehouse, there was also a parking lot of the Hong Kong military authorities, with hundreds of military vehicles parked. Fortunately, the fire did not spread, and some vehicles and important equipment (including a lathe worth 600,000 yuan) in the CRRRA warehouse were safe. According to current information, the lost goods include a large number of automobile tires, numbering hundreds, and several barrels of gasoline. Further investigation is still underway.

The CRRRA warehouse is located at the intersection of Chatham Road and Gascoigne Road, covering a large area and surrounded by wire mesh. Vehicles and related equipment transported by UNRRA are stored here. At one end of the site, there are two wooden houses serving as offices, one storing tires, canvas, etc. The other is a power generation room. Because the area is pitch black at night, the authorities generate their own electricity to protect the stored goods from theft by criminals, keeping the surroundings bright and making it easier for guards to prevent theft. Next to the generator room, there are four rooms where the watchmen and generator drivers live. It is said that after the power was turned on last night, the driver went out. Unexpectedly, perhaps due to the long time, the heat was too high, and somehow the wooden boards next to it caught fire, causing the big fire. The fire on the wooden boards quickly spread to the sundries in the room and the wooden house where the tires and canvas were stored, and the fire became even more intense. After receiving the report, three fire trucks rushed to the rescue, but water did not arrive until half an hour after arrival, due to water restrictions at night. Before the water arrived, firefighters could only use fire extinguishers to put out the fire and dismantle the road to prevent the fire from spreading to other places. By the time the hose was opened, the two small wooden houses had been almost completely burned down, but because most of them were tires, the fire was still very fierce. During the burning, small explosions often occurred. After 11:40 pm, the fire was completely under control and extinguished around 12:00. At that time, a northwest wind was blowing, which did not spread to most of the vehicles on its side. There were hundreds of unopened car boxes on its side, stacked three feet high and covering an area of six or seven feet. There were also twenty-four newly assembled cars on Gascoigne Road, and six or seven cars under the wire mesh. In addition, a lathe for repairing tools worth HK$600,000 was also safe. After the incident, UNRRA engineer Kerton immediately went to the scene to direct employees to rescue. The most valuable lathe was rescued at this time.

### Science and Culture Chinese Delegation Evening Party, the Musical Accomplishments of Two Ladies from Hubei and Guangdong can be compared with European and American Artists

— Special Correspondent Wang Ren of this Newspaper in Paris

13th Day News

From mid-November to mid-December 1946, the French call it Science and Culture Month Mols de I'Unesco. The music of Qin and Ge, the joy of banquets, is unprecedented and always makes people feel overwhelmed. The most commendable is the Chinese Science and Culture Delegation's late-night Soiree at the Chemical Society at 9:00 pm on December 9th. Those who attended included Ambassador Qian Jieping (Thailand), Madame Qian, Miss Qian, consular officials in Paris, representatives from various countries to the Science and Culture Conference, and important men and women from the United States, Britain, and France who are friendly to China. Also present were Ms. Yang Lianxin, a female singer Cantatrice from the Royal Academy of Music in England, Ms. Rosemarie Anderson Han, a former student who specially flew to Paris to invite Ms. Yang to promote national glory in Norway. Representatives from the Science and Culture industry, including Dr. Zhao Yuanren, Dr. Li Shuhua, Dr. Cheng Tianfang, and Dr. Zhu Kezhen, as well as Professor Chen Yuan, Mr. Xiao Zisheng (Yu), Chairman of the China-France Association and former Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Mining, Ms. Xiao Lingxiao Yin, wife of Chen Yuan, Ms. Pan Yuliang, former professor, Dr. Zhou Lin, Xie Shou Kang, former Chinese Ambassador to the Vatican and a scholar of the Royal Academy of Literature of Belgium, Hu Tianshi, Director of the Swiss International Library, Guo Youshou, former Director of the Sichuan Education Department, Qian Cundian, Counselor of the Embassy in the United Kingdom, and members of the delegation Qu Junong, Liang Fangzhong, Ye Junjian, Kuang Zixiu, Wang Chengxu, Qian Sanqiang, etc., as well as hundreds of Chinese and foreign male and female guests.

In recent years, Chinese students studying in Europe have made significant progress compared to the end of the first Paris Peace Conference twenty years ago. The Science and Education Bureau's great Renaissance painting has also provided an excellent opportunity for famous Chinese artists to show their talents on the international stage. For example, the two sisters from Hubei and Guangdong who came to help this time have scientific achievements and can be compared with European and American talents. It is impossible without ten years of large-scale sacrifice of money and time. The long-term War of Resistance of China has just completed the artistic efforts of these people over the years. It is enough to make compatriots at home and abroad have optimistic expectations for the future of China. This delegation's late-night victory and the scientific and cultural complementing Qin and Ge programs should be divided into three sections as follows:

(A) The former section, Zhou Xiaoyan, daughter of Shanghai banker Zhou Cangbai, sang Chinese songs scored into the wind by singer Jiangxia Zhou, Piano (ie piano), (1) Song of the Lotus time. (2) petite pois Rouges, both of the above songs were composed by Chinese young composer Liu Xue'an. (3) Love Call, the score was compiled by Jiang Wenye. (4) How Can I Help Thlnklng of You. Written by Zhao Yuanren, now professor of Chinese studies at Harvard University in the United States. (5) Yunnan Mountain Song, which has a slight local flavor. This song was adapted into a score by Russian musician A. Tcherepnine Qi Peilin, who once traveled to China. The Eastern and Western styles are smelted in one furnace. The singer is skilled and light, and the round and smooth sound is most welcomed by the Western guests present.

(B) The middle section, Ms. Li Xianmin from Lingnan, who graduated first in Shanghai Conservatory of Music, studied abroad with famous teachers for many years, and is talented, clear, and unique, played the piano. (1) Overture to the Music Drama, scored by Liu Xue'an. (2) La Fluteu Berger, composed by He Luding. (3) d, composed by Lao Jingcheng. (4) Sketch, composed by Jiang Wenye. (5) Button Qin. (6) Yi Bi Zhonghua, the scores of the above rain songs were all made by Russian musician Qi Peilin. Qi once traveled to China, and was inspired by listening to the pipa, so he described its sound in the score. Ms. Li sits sideways on the piano platform, her eyes are bright and her hands are agile, she plucks lightly, moves rhythmically, strums fiercely and strikes quickly, and the beauty lies in her graceful posture. "Yi Bi Zhonghua" has both advantages, and the reporter has never seen such a demeanor and impression in the music performances of Europe and the United States in his life. (C) The latter section is the most exciting performance. The wonderful thing is that Ms. Zhou is proficient in English, Italian, French and German, and the performances come in turn, as if she has the technique of incarnation. She improvised a seven-character quatrain by Zhou Xiaoyan Jiahui to broadcast the clear sound, with the sentence:

"The golden age is full of vigor, singing red beans and smiling, the pearl throat is busy like a swallow, and the sound education is widely promoted with this talent." I also received a close-up photo from Ms. Li Xianmin, and I also responded with a poem, with the sentence:

"The fragrance of the clothes moves slightly, and the night is bright, the quick button is played lightly, and all kinds of amorous feelings are born, the immortal Ci Xian is surnamed Li, how can the magic hand be different from Xia Qing? (A female aviator who travels to North and South America has the same surname as you).

### The Call for Theatrical Movement

Several comrades engaged in theatrical work recently had a symposium at the Central Cultural Movement Committee. They expressed many opinions on the Chinese theatrical movement. Mr. Yu Shangyuan was appointed to organize them on the spot. The following article is the record of the organization. It is hoped that people from all walks of life who care about the theatrical movement will provide more assistance so that the Chinese theatrical movement can develop normally.

With the victorious end of the eight-year War of Resistance, we should build a new China with national independence, civil rights and freedom, and the people's livelihood and happiness with more abundant cooked feelings and more active efforts. This is the responsibility of every Chinese people, and it is also the responsibility of every theatrical worker. Unfortunately, after returning to the capital and returning to the army, and when preparing to start work, like other departments of cultural undertakings, the theatrical movement has more difficulties. The experience of the past year has told us that if we do not quickly save the current crisis, the future of the theatrical movement is really difficult to be optimistic.

The environment of the eight-year War of Resistance was extremely difficult. Thanks to the sincere unity of theatrical workers across the country, under the leadership of the All-China Theatrical Community Anti-Enemy Association, each did their best and went all out, which had laid a relatively solid foundation. Whether in the rear, the front line, behind the enemy, or the isolated Shanghai, whether in cities or villages, they have left visible achievements, directly or indirectly contributing to the War of Resistance. We are unwilling to deny our own insufficient efforts and certain weaknesses in this stage. Similarly, we are unwilling to ignore the various difficulties imposed on the theatrical movement by the objective environment. Because the problem has not been resolved immediately and reasonably, we are still suffering today. Moreover, with the evolution of the objective situation, there are even new problems in front of us. We theatrical workers know that our duty is to overcome all difficulties to promote the theatrical movement. However, the theatrical movement is not an isolated thing that is isolated from the vast society. We cannot but ask people from all walks of life and the government authorities to have a deeper understanding, sympathy and assistance to the current situation of the theatrical movement, so that it can smoothly overcome the current crisis.

The fact that the troupes in Nanjing (Shanghai, Hankou, and other recovered cities) - including state-owned, private, professional, and amateur - cannot perform or perform with great difficulty and end up with few praises and even lose money is a common phenomenon. Tracing its cause, the first is the problem of entertainment tax.

We do not think that the problem of entertainment tax has only economic significance. Through the micro-collection rate of "40%", it clearly treats dramas and other kinds of entertainment equally. We do not deny the entertainment of dramas, but the difference is that it has more educational effects in entertainment - a broad education, that is, to improve the cultural level of the audience (people), and to get upward inspiration and encouragement from here. At the same time, drama is precisely the concrete manifestation of the national culture. This is the reason why the British would rather give up India than give up Shakespeare, and it is also the reason why we set up the National Academy of Drama and never thought of running a school to train other entertainment talents; it is also the reason why the Ministry of Education and the Central Propaganda Department set up drama awards during the War of Resistance. Although the 40% entertainment tax is collected on the ticket and is added to the audience, the troupe is actually the one who suffers the loss. If the tax is exempted or reduced to 5% or 10%, the audience will pay the same ticket price, and the troupe will increase its income, which can further reduce the ticket price and attract more audiences.

The general increase in prices has obviously greatly increased the cost of performances. The total expenditure for an performance of 300,000 to 400,000 yuan has become very common. Among them, the most suitable for saving is the rent of the theater. The rent of the National Grand Theater for the performance of the China ×× Troupe in Beijing was 500,000 yuan per game (per night), and then it rose to 1.8 million yuan per game. Even if it can be reduced, it cannot be less than 1 million yuan per game. The Guangming Grand Theater, which can only accommodate 700 people, such as the one rented by the Great Wall Theater Company, is 600,000 yuan per game. Because the theater does not have its own theater, it not only has to bear the huge rent as above, but also has intangible losses, such as the length of the performance period cannot be free, which not only affects the economy, but also affects the art - the contract cannot be signed and dared to start work rashly, once the contract is signed, it must be on stage as scheduled and not allowed to consider whether the play is well rehearsed, which gives us great pain.

Drama cannot be separated from the audience. The Nanjing theatrical movement, which has only started now, is also affected by the audience. We are not criticizing the audience, but this is the fact. Due to high prices and difficult life. The purchasing power of the general audience has been greatly reduced. Even if they like drama very much, they are often limited by their economic ability and stop in place. This is one. Except for some people who have returned from Chongqing, most of the people who have struggled under the rule of the enemy and puppets, even if they have not completely sunk into low-level entertainment, are still relatively unfamiliar with drama. It is difficult to enthusiastically find the things they need from the drama stage. This is two. If the audience asks to find the things they need from the drama stage, what can we give them? Reflecting reality is a feature of drama. When they feel that there is a distance between the stage at this time and place and the life at this time and place. Once disappointed, one more time you have to wait and see. This is three. To make the audience know drama and love drama, there must be regular performances and excellent performances, and this is a difficult thing.

If we have unintentionally disappointed the audience, it is our own fault. We admit that there have been few new scripts this year, and even fewer scripts suitable for this time and place. Before we ask playwrights to write more. We should also understand the situation of playwrights. The fact is that, on the one hand, the objective environment up to now cannot be understood at a glance. It is a creative detour to praise or expose it only by seeing the superficial phenomenon. This takes time. On the one hand, when performances (as well as publications and publications) are so difficult, there is no way to urge playwrights to continuously supply new works. Some people are preparing, some people are writing, and some people have written but are reluctant to take it out. This requires a stable environment. Similarly, without time and a stable environment, not only playwrights, but also directors, actors, and stage workers will find it difficult to have new creations, resulting in stagnation and even regression.

The stagnation and even regression of theatrical workers is the stagnation and regression of the theatrical movement. Reflecting on ourselves, we should blame ourselves for insufficient understanding, insufficient efforts, and insufficient unity. However, in any case, the improvement of the objective environment is a more important prerequisite. We firmly believe that people from all walks of life and the government authorities cherish the theatrical movement. Therefore, at this time and place, we have described the current situation and hope that:

(1) Confirm the position of drama in culture and education, and give it positive, strong, and planned support, so that drama becomes the healthy spiritual food of the people of the whole country and an important pillar of national construction.

(2) Exempt or reduce entertainment tax. The performances of all state-owned troupes and private troupes that have been approved for registration by the competent authorities shall be exempted from entertainment tax to reduce the burden on the theater and popularize the audience.

(3) Establish state-owned theaters and provide them to troupes completely free of charge or at a very low rent. At the beginning, enemy and puppet properties can be requisitioned to replace construction.

(4) Guarantee the livelihood of theater workers, so that theater workers can engage in creation and research with peace of mind and concentration.

(5) Reward script creation and performance.

This is the urgent task to save the crisis, and this is also our call. We theatrical workers should unite as sincerely as during the War of Resistance, do our best, go all out, overcome difficulties together, overcome the crisis, and participate in the great cause of building a new China with national independence, people's freedom, and people's happiness!

Publishing industry Published every Thursday

### Publishing and Taxation

— Fu Tongxian

Recently, two major events have occurred in the Chinese publishing industry, both of which will have a great impact on the publishing industry. One is the issue of business tax on the book industry, and the other is the issue of price increases for news mail and telecommunications. The book industry and the news media are asking the government to reconsider and save China's declining cultural undertakings.

Regarding the business tax on the book industry, we know that after the Shanghai Municipal Council resolved to exempt it, 286 book businesses in Shanghai sent 17 representatives to Beijing to petition, asking the Ministry of Finance to exempt the tax. However, recently, the Book Industry Association received a message from the Ministry of Education to the Ministry of Finance, which only allowed state-approved textbooks to be exempt from business tax, and the rest must still be taxed. Now the book industry is sending representatives to Beijing to petition again. We hope that the government will pay special attention to the cultural publishing industry and approve the full exemption. At the same time, we also hope that the municipal authorities will, on the one hand, accept the resolution of the Municipal Council to increase the construction loss, and on the other hand, adopt the resolution to exempt the business tax on the book industry.

Regarding the price increase of news mail and telecommunications, the Xinwen Bao had a dramatic record on the 17th, which said: "Today, more than 150 reporters from various places went to Minister Yu in the Traffic Ministry Building, which cost nearly 10 billion yuan to repair and is unparalleled and exquisite, to petition for the ten-fold increase in mail and telecommunications prices, and to maintain the original prices in order to continue the cultural undertakings. Because in this high price of mail and telecommunications, the national news undertakings will suffer huge losses. During the two-hour petition, Minister Yu said that he was not interested in making things difficult for the news media." We know that the government has suffered a lot of losses in mail and telecommunications and must find ways to make up for them. A reasonable price increase and the collection of business tax are the country's financial resources, which we seem to have no need to comment on, but the government should not treat the publishing and cultural industry as equal to other commercial businesses that aim at profit, and should give special consideration to them.

However, under the situation that the government particularly emphasizes opening up sources of income, we feel that the government should rectify tax collection, eliminate embezzlement, and the most important thing seems to be to spend more effort in saving money, so as not to overemphasize the cultural undertakings.

### On the Path of Chinese Education Reform

— Chen Kemei

Written by Chen Guofu, Published by Zhengzhong Book Company

All those with foresight regarding Chinese education feel that Chinese education needs a philosophy to integrate its implementation under one or several principles. It cannot continue to copy and imitate from the West, resulting in little effect after fifty years. While everyone feels this way, few have come forward to provide this need. Mr. Wu Junsheng once suggested that scholars from all fields across the country first conduct a comprehensive investigation of China's past culture and modern needs to determine a common philosophy. Then, based on this philosophy, deduce several guiding principles as a foundation for theory and implementation to form an educational philosophy. This is one approach. Alternatively, scholars from all fields can freely publish their research, then synthesize or select from these studies to determine the principles of educational theory and implementation, thus creating an educational philosophy. Perhaps neither of these methods is suitable, and we can only allow the free development of various ideas and the natural formation of an educational philosophy.

In 1933, Mr. Jiang Qi published a book titled "Educational Philosophy" (also named "The Three Principles of the People Education"), hoping it would become a Chinese educational philosophy. Its impact is unknown. Now I have read Mr. Chen Guofu's "The Path of Chinese Education Reform," which also proposes educational reform based on the Three Principles of the People. However, this book differs from the previous one. The former leans towards pure theory, while this book emphasizes application and has a complete educational plan.

The book's content can be summarized in two parts: the first discusses general principles and education at all levels, and the second discusses various educational issues and methods for implementing reforms. Regarding principles, it is "entirely based on our country's inherent ethical philosophy, with filial piety as its starting point, gradually expanding to realize the ideal of 'the world is for all' and 'universal harmony.'" ... Even the entire educational process or system in the book is based on our country's philosophical system of self-cultivation, family management, governance, and peace as the basis for dividing the process, "so that education at each stage has a distinct central goal." (From Wang's preface) And of these two parts, principles are the most important. As the author says, "I believe that in improving education, principles are the most important, and methods are secondary." (Page 1) Therefore, this book has the flavor of an educational philosophy and the potential to form one.

Today's Need for Educational Philosophy

The author has completed this book based on decades of observation and experience, and it certainly contains unique insights and comprehensive proposals. For example, he says that the "main reason for the failure" of past education "lies in the fact that our education has lost its spirit of self-confidence and initiative, only seeing others and forgetting ourselves; therefore, we only know how to copy, unable to digest, let alone ..." He also says that the root cause of the failure of Chinese education is ... "finding the starting point of education ... several decades ... pouring ... lingering ... glimpse ... is ... maintaining ... view ... of ethics ...?" That is ... subtle ... is the author ... is the author ... he ... saying the insight itself is ... that, but saying that Chinese education should still maintain filial piety as the starting point and give full play to its effectiveness" is unique. Based on this starting point of education, the author especially emphasizes family education, "Therefore, family education is the fundamental question of all problems in the human world," establishing "a foundation for being a person" for life. Starting from this foundation, "national education," "life education," "special education," "normal education," "university education," and "imperial academy education" are all based on the philosophy of self-cultivation, family management, governance, and peace, and their establishments are based on it: this is the author's comprehensive proposal. Therefore, this book is also a most stimulating work, which can stimulate the creation of Chinese educational philosophy and also stimulate the opening up of new Chinese education.

As for whether China's educational philosophy should be formed in this way, and whether China's new education should be carried out in this way, in my humble opinion, I will briefly state my views as a small contribution.

The Starting Point of Education

I have stated that Chinese culture has two characteristics: one is the ethical characteristic, and the other is the conservative characteristic. I have also criticized that this type of ethical culture pays too much attention to family relationships in human relations and neglects larger social relationships. Therefore, the Chinese people's family concept is too deep, resulting in a weak national or social concept, and failing to produce a strong and unified national group to resist various aggressions from the great powers (Education and Culture, Education Communication, Volume 3, Issue 41). Although it is said very well in theory that taking filial piety as the starting point, "establishing normal rules for the ethical relationship between parents and siblings, and extending it from there, social order, national governance, and peace can be maintained as a result"; but in fact, the Chinese people (especially the most highly educated people under the old education) mostly only know about the family and do not know about the country, let alone the world, and the so-called "the world is for all" or "universal harmony" is even more impossible to achieve. Why has the moral education of China for thousands of years failed to teach people to extend fraternal piety to society? There are two reasons: one is that the ideal is too high and difficult to implement; the other is that the circle is drawn too large and cannot be reached.

Therefore, thousands of years of moral education have only taught people to live a family life and maintain a patriarchal society; but now that the competition for survival is so fierce and the national struggle is so fierce, it will soon transform China's family life and patriarchal society.

The Goal of Education

Therefore, what we need to teach the people now is how to seek the survival of the nation, to enable the national masses to engage in production and construction in peacetime and to resist and defend themselves in wartime, and to enable everyone to have the intelligence for production and self-defense and the spirit of unity and sacrifice. Even "the world is for all" and "universal harmony" may as well be taught one step at a time. Speaking of the intelligence of production and self-defense, it is naturally based on science; speaking of the spirit of unity and sacrifice, it is also naturally based on democracy. Only science and democracy can enable the Chinese nation to catch up head-on; and only science and democracy can achieve the world for all and universal harmony. Therefore, China's new education should take the Three Principles of the People as its ideal, national rejuvenation as its goal, and nationalization, democratization, scientification, and industrialization as its guidelines. Or to put it more concretely, China's new education should cultivate healthy citizens who can build and defend themselves. The focus of this new education is to promote a new national spirit—a spirit in which the individual and the nation are integrated, a spirit of dedication and sacrifice to the nation. Only with this spirit can the Chinese nation stand firm; only if the nation stands firm first can we seek the transformation of the world, from the family to the nation, and from the nation to the world. This is the program for human social evolution and the stage that the state and society must go through. The starting point of this new education is individuality, based on the individuality of each child, to develop their body and mind, so that they can share in the work of national rejuvenation; we must make the development of individuality and the rejuvenation of the nation match each other to adapt to this unprecedented era.

As for the methods of developing children's bodies and minds and promoting the national spirit, there is no need to draw a large circle, that is, to use children's common nature and special personality to cultivate their national emotions and national consciousness. For example, children have a common sense of curiosity, which can be used to visit China's historical sites and scenic spots to arouse their emotions of loving China and their awareness of recognizing China; to make them feel and know that China is a civilized nation with a long history, and to make them feel and know that China has magnificent rivers and mountains with abundant resources: in this way, children's spirit of being willing to sacrifice for their country and nation can arise spontaneously.

In short, the ideal of national new education should meet the needs of the times. What is needed in the present era? It is the struggle and survival of the nation, that is, to cultivate healthy citizens with a national spirit to seek national survival from the national struggle. Of course, we are by no means saying that we do not want people to be filial and fraternal, but we believe that people who are filial and fraternal do not necessarily love their country and nation, while people who love their country and nation are certainly able to be filial and fraternal.

The Educational Process

The author says, "The stage of primary school education is a kind of moral education, which teaches the foundation of how to be a person and cultivates the concept of loving the country and the nation. The stage of junior high school education is to cultivate personal skills and knowledge for independent living. The stage of senior high school education is not only to educate him to be able to make a living on his own, but also to be able to help others make a living. Therefore, the stage of middle school can be said to be the education of 'managing the family.' But the word 'family' here should be extended to a social interpretation. At the stage of university, he is taught the education of 'governing the country,' cultivating his professional skills to seek welfare for the country and the nation. Further up to the Imperial Academy, he is taught the education of 'pacifying the world.' In this way, from self-cultivation, managing the family, governing the country to pacifying the world, the front and back operate smoothly, and each becomes a paragraph. It is really a very good educational process." (Page 12) To divide the current educational programs according to the program of self-cultivation, family management, governance, and peace in the university, but in our view, the fundamental nature of the former is not the same. The educational program in the university is an educational program for cultivating a few scholar-officials, while the current educational programs at all levels are educational programs for cultivating talents at all levels. It is fundamentally difficult to match the two. The difference between the educational program in the university and the current educational program is very obvious. Because the self-cultivation, family management, governance, and peace in the university is the entire program for cultivating a kind of talent, which cannot be separated; from self-cultivation to family management, from family management to governing the country, from governing the country to pacifying the world, it runs through, and cannot be divided into sections again. As for the current education at all levels, it is to cultivate talents at all levels, which can be divided into sections; as the author said, "Every stage has the effect of a stage; every step taught has a use": whether it has been done in fact (the big problem of Chinese education is that it has not been done), in principle it should be so. Therefore, China's new education must not divide the educational program for cultivating multiple talents according to the educational program for cultivating one kind of talent.

The above two points are only discussed in terms of the largest; other topics such as the rumination education method, the coordination of the Three Principles of the People and the education of each stage, and life education have not been discussed in detail; as for paying attention to mother education and paying attention to the continuity and independence of education at all levels, there are all excellent insights, which have not been described in detail. In China, it is really commendable for someone like Mr. Chen to find a direction for Chinese education with a consistent stand, although our opinions are not completely the same. In short, this is a very stimulating work and a good reference book for those who are interested in the reform of Chinese education. It is worth everyone's chewing and reviewing.

### Best-Selling Books in the United States in 1946

— Lan Ning

As winter ends and the year draws to a close, "Time" magazine in the United States has conducted a review of the books published in the United States this year. In 1946, 7,500 new books were published, including 1,500 novels, 300 history books, and 400 biographies. The quality of these books, generally speaking, is not very high.

Generally speaking, book critics have not published excessive praises. In the "Year's Most Outstanding Books" poll in the "New York Times Book Review," no book has received unanimous praise from all book critics. Selecting the best from the short. In terms of the widest sales and the most money earned, it should be "The Egg and I" by Ms. Betty MacDonald—an epic about raising chickens (or an autobiography of married life) that has sold 1.2 million copies. The remaining nine best-selling books are listed as follows:

Fiction

Author

This Side of Innocence Caldwell

The King's General Du Maurier

The Foxes of Harrow Frank Yerby

Arch of Triumph Maria Remarque

Brideshead Revisited Evelyn Waugh

David the King Gladys Schmitt

The Hucksters Frederic Wakeman

Non-Fiction Author

The Egg and I Betty MacDonald

Peace of Mind L. Liebman

I Chose Freedom Victor Kravchenko

Among the seven fiction books, most of the sales have exceeded one million. Among them, "Arch of Triumph" by Remarque, often serialized in the "Saturday Evening Post" weekly, was translated into Chinese by Zhu Wen.

No one knows whether the reason why these books have such wide sales should be attributed to writing, advertising, or the promotion of various book clubs in the United States.

According to "Time" magazine, a new literary genius has not yet appeared after the war. People in the American publishing industry often explain it this way: It hasn't been long since the war ended, so masterpieces haven't been completed yet. But is this true? Let's take a look at the book list after 1919 (World War I): "Rousseau and Romanticism" by Babbitt, "The Arrow of Gold" by Conrad, "The Economic Consequences of the Peace" by Keynes, "Reynaud the Fox" by Masefield, "The Moon of the Caribbees" by O'Neill, and "The Moon and Sixpence" by Maugham were all immortal works of that year. The stimulus of World War II may have been too great for people, and geniuses cannot yet answer those complex questions through art.

### "Son of the Regiment"

— Li Jinxiang

Written by Kataev, translated by Mao Dun, first published in early October of the 35th year of the Republic

The Soviet writer Kataev, his name may not be unfamiliar to readers in the mountain country. Seven or eight years ago, two of his works, "Time, Forward!" and "I Am the Son of the Working People," had Chinese translations.

"Son of the Regiment" is a novel with a large number of readers in the Soviet Union. It won the Stalin Literary Award in 1945. That year, there were a total of four awards for literature in the field of novels. "Son of the Regiment" won the second prize in the novel category, and the first prize was awarded to "Young Guards" and "Lavrov." The other novel that won the second prize was ...

The whole book takes the Soviet-German war as its theme, and the story develops in a plain atmosphere from beginning to end.

The protagonist of this book, Vanya, is a lonely Russian child. Brutal ambition has destroyed his beautiful home, killed his parents, and made him wander outside all year round. Fortunately, he met the motherland's reconnaissance soldiers, who rescued him and brought him to their regimental headquarters.

Moreover, the reconnaissance soldiers soon discovered the child's genius, intelligence, bravery, and attractiveness, making him a natural reconnaissance soldier. But the order from the superiors came down that underage children were not allowed to stay on the front line, and he immediately sent someone to send him back to the rear.

Orders cannot overcome human will. Vanya resolutely opposed being sent back to the rear. After the attempt failed, he actually escaped from the sender's oversight.

Fortunately, he met Captain Yeraginov, the superior who ordered him to be sent back to the rear (at that time, Vanya did not recognize who he was). The captain, like other reconnaissance soldiers, had a good impression of him because of his intelligence and attractiveness. Without a doubt, he took the child back to the troops.

Vanya's wish was fulfilled, and he is now a reconnaissance soldier. When he went out to reconnaissance for the first time, he was unfortunately discovered by the enemy and captured. He did not escape and return to the team until the enemy troops retreated.

Captain Yeraginov's experience was the same as Vanya's. His young wife, elderly mother, and boy who was not yet seven years old were all brutally killed by the German invaders. All that was left was a string of anger and tragic memories. Therefore, he had a feeling of sympathy and intimacy with Vanya, and soon adopted Vanya as his godson, and in order to avoid danger (reconnaissance soldiers are very dangerous), he transferred him to the artillery team as a reserve soldier.

War is inherently cruel and inhumane. The artillery fire reached the sky, and blood and flesh were exchanged. A tense and fierce tank battle came on the Soviet-German border. Captain Yeraginov died for his country in this battle. A small note was found in his pocket, in which he asked his superiors to take care of his son and train him to be a good soldier.

Vanya was really soon sent to a military academy, starting a new page in his life.

The story ends like this. The author depicts the personality of each person clearly, making people feel that the characters in the book are lifelike. This is the most successful point of the book.

"Son of the Regiment" is a retranslation based on the English translation. The English translation is slightly different from the Russian text. The Russian text has a total of 28 chapters, while the English version only has 25 chapters. The English translator deleted some unimportant ones, so the chapter division is also different. The Chinese translation is the same as the English translation, but slightly different from the Russian text. This is also what readers should pay attention to.

### Reading "Sexual Psychology"

— Meng Kun

Original by Havelock Ellis

Translated and annotated by Pan Guangdan, published by The Commercial Press

As the author, Zhi Ruo, often mentions in this book, modern humans pride themselves on being civilized enough, but they are still so ignorant about matters of sex. This kind of deeply rooted misconception suggests that the society we live in is not open-minded enough, and the author's criticisms of Europeans and Americans half a century ago are still very applicable to our country today.

Westerners' reluctance to discuss sexual issues is due to the constraints of religious traditions, while China has its own deformed moral concepts. Although the essence is different, the result is the same. From primitive humans to the present era, the mysterious veil surrounding "sex" has never been lifted. However, if it could be regarded as a mere abstract theory, it wouldn't matter if it were banished from the realm of thought, but it has a close and real relationship with every individual and cannot be abandoned!

Therefore, although it has not yet been possible to discuss it openly on the surface of society, many people have paid attention to it before considering it a topic for discussion. However, taking advantage of the psychological vulnerability and curiosity of young people, a large number of books on sex have already been circulating semi-openly on the market, passing from hand to hand among young people. Because the compilers of these books lack a serious attitude, the content is often biased or even deliberately distorted, not only failing to provide readers with the necessary common sense but also leading to various adverse consequences and anti-educational outcomes in an unscientific manner.

The Sacred Question

"Sex" is a sacred question and a responsibility for social educators. Sex education is of utmost importance to the nation, both in terms of spiritual life and public life, and cannot be neglected. Europeans and Americans only began to pay attention to this issue in the early 20th century. In addition to many research books being published one after another, based on various unique perspectives and methods, periodic publications also frequently discussed it, but the content was biased towards medicine or physiology. Later, after being applied to the framework of criminology, it gradually formed a cultural academic discipline.

The author of this book, Havelock Ellis, was a contemporary of Sigmund Freud, and he devoted almost his entire life to exploring this issue. With his literary talent, his research results were published and disseminated to various countries and societies. Although his perspective is also psychological, it differs from Freud's purely "psychoanalytic" approach, making it more scientific and progressive. Before the publication of this book, Ellis was already famous for his "Studies in the Psychology of Sex." However, while rich in content, it was not universal enough and not suitable as a manual for instilling common sense. It was not until the writing of this book that this long-awaited deficiency was filled.

Scientific Method

This book, which is less than 300,000 words, discusses every noteworthy "sexual" issue in a simple yet comprehensive manner. The method is scientific, and more so sociological and anthropological, analyzing and instructing from both horizontal and vertical perspectives, and it is also educational. The author not only objectively exposes the existence of a fact but also subjectively adds many opinions. These many opinions are often encountered by young people in the course of their lives and can determine their happiness or misfortune.

In terms of content, in addition to the topic indicated by the title, concerning sexual psychology, it also touches on various branches of other sexual issues. There are still clear boundaries that can be distinguished from sexual physiology and sexual hygiene. However, they are still interconnected and can be enlightening.

Outline of the Book

The framework consists of eight chapters and forty-three sections, plus a preface and a translator's note, and two appendices (including Ellis's unpublished biography). The form and context are clear. The first chapter, "General Considerations," discusses the author's overall views on the issue of "sex" and the motivation for research. The second chapter, "The Biology of Sex," starts from the physiological body and explains the process of its transfer to the spirit, and discusses "sexual selection" and its various factors in more detail. The following chapter, "Sexual Impulses in Adolescence," talks about the initial presentation of love and the measures taken to deal with it, explaining the various detours and the requirements for "sex education" for adolescents after making changes. The above three chapters almost completely describe the normal psychology of sex. The following two chapters are a study of sexual perversion. The symbolism of love, sexual deviations, and various abnormal sexual behaviors from childhood to decline, as well as the critical attitude given by society, constitute the content of the fourth chapter. Extending from this similar point is the issue of sexual inversion, that is, "homosexuality." In the fifth chapter, the author answers in detail and concludes with the treatment of this phenomenon of deviation. Chapter Six, "Marriage," explains the intricacies of this phenomenon from a psychological and social perspective, with many points that can supplement traditional views. "The Art of Love" in Chapter Seven expresses its relationship from a sexual point of view, considering it as one of the means of enjoying life. Finally, the "Conclusion" discusses the "dynamism" and "sublimation" of sexual impulses, respectively, and the great accumulation of human culture cannot be separated from this original force, which has always been considered obscene.

The Translator's Achievement

Even more commendable is the translator, Mr. Pan Guangdan, who is an authority on eugenics and physiology in our country. His efforts in translating this book are of epoch-making value and significance. The beauty of the translation is not only impeccable, but also the smoothness and harmony are truly worthy of admiration. In addition, there are nearly 100,000 words of annotations, and an appendix on homosexuality, separated from the annotations, which draws out examples from ancient Chinese literature and gives them a new scientific evaluation, so that countless doubtful signs in old literature can get a new basis, and it is considered another original way for Chinese scholars to study sexual psychology.

Ellis's original work was considered a banned book in foreign countries twenty years ago. Fortunately, there are no enthusiasts in China now who come out to "defend morality" and criticize it as indecent. Although there have been translations or writings similar to this book before, they have not been widely circulated. Another translation of this book, translated by Tian Fengmingzhang and titled "Sexual Psychology," has been published six times. However, in comparison, in addition to the lack of annotations and writing style, Feng's work also deletes too much about theoretical aspects. It is mentioned here incidentally, but the contributions of the two introducers to our society are worthy of praise.

As for the only shortcoming of this book, it can be said that the author still cannot completely get rid of his moralistic flavor. The old man often promotes his moderate moral views in various parts of this book. However, despite this, and despite many other places where we cannot agree, it is still not enough to diminish the value of this book. Even if it does not become a textbook template, it is circulated among young people. And because of the wide circulation, the formation of a new atmosphere and its contribution to the spiritual perspective of society are still immeasurable.

Spring and Autumn

### Huihui

— Shi Mo

In May of the thirty-third year, when the enemy attacked Changsha, Deng hurriedly took one of his female classmates back to the countryside, because this female classmate's home had already fallen before Changsha. Deng's family called her "Miss Yang." But Deng called his female classmate "Huihui." Huihui was quite beautiful, and her age looked to be about nineteen, but Deng said she was only eighteen. Two soft, long braids hung on her shoulders, and a pair of large, dark eyes looked at people without shyness. On the first day of her arrival, Deng's entire family was amazed. On the second day, Deng's neighbors discovered that such a young lady had arrived, and they were also amazed. On the third and fourth days, the nearby towns were all amazed.

People exchanged the same opinions after seeing her, saying: "This Miss Yang actually followed Deng to his house? This is a time of war and chaos. In times of war and chaos, young people..." Saying this, everyone couldn't help but say at the same time: "Miss Yang is very beautiful, very pretty."

Deng's father, seeing that Deng took care of everything for Huihui and was very attentive, shook his head and said: "In this day and age, what love is there to be in love with?"

But soon, the enemy crossed Changsha and attacked Hengyang. This countryside was only a hundred miles away from Changsha, and it immediately became uneasy. People were busy escaping for their lives and rarely talked about Huihui. Deng's family also gradually became familiar with Huihui, as if there was no such person, or as if she was a member of the family. When holding family meetings to discuss escape, Huihui also sat next to Deng at the table.

As a result of the discussion, Deng's family moved to a mountain valley fifteen miles away from this town. From the second morning, Deng's family began to move.

At this time, Huihui suddenly became lively. She helped carry this and that, and lift this and that, working with Deng's mother, sister-in-law, and younger sister. When they felt they needed to ask Deng or male workers to help, Huihui immediately did it, and did it quickly and properly. In this way, Deng's mother felt very happy. A girl who likes to do boys' things is very suitable for "escape."

After moving to the mountain valley, many families had moved to the left and right of Deng's house. Deng's family lived in two small thatched huts of tenants. Because there were many women and children, Huihui often couldn't sleep in these two small huts. Deng took Huihui to go guerrilla everywhere. If there were other families where the women were not too crowded when they slept, Huihui would squeeze in with a smile. Everyone shouted: "Miss Yang! Miss Yang! You can't squeeze in." At this time, Huihui had already fallen asleep.

But Huihui was always reluctant to speak. She only smiled. When she was happy, she would widen her big eyes and speak loudly, laughing, and the two braids would swing violently left and right behind her head. Every three to five days, she would go with Deng and Deng's younger brother, along with workers, to go home to carry oil, salt, firewood, rice, and sundries. Deng's father's wine bottle was empty again, and suddenly his sister-in-law remembered that the child's shoes were still left at home. Huihui and the others risked walking fifteen miles to go home.

Although Huihui was very happy to transport things, it was not an easy task. In the small town, there were all kinds of people, and they all had weapons. Once, Huihui and the other three were cleaning up some sundries at home and carrying two bags of rice back to the mountain valley. As soon as they locked the door and turned around to leave, the team came from the town towards this side. They had to bend down and look for small paths to move to the deep grass, but they had to cross this road no matter what to return to the mountain valley. They waited and waited, but the team was too long. When it was dusk, Huihui said she couldn't wait any longer and wanted to cross the road. Seeing a soldier walking past five or six steps ahead, and the next soldier was ten or so steps behind, Huihui suddenly jumped up, sprinted across the road, and stepped into the deep grass on the other side, scaring the two soldiers. After swearing, Deng, his younger brother, and the worker also crossed the road in accordance with the law and returned to the small house in the mountain valley. It was already dark, and the whole family praised Huihui's bravery.

Huihui's two braids were her favorite. When she was bored sitting in the small house, she would untie them and ask her sister-in-law to comb them for her. After a month or two, everyone in Deng's family liked Huihui. Her sister-in-law also carefully braided her hair for her from time to time; sometimes she would sit there silently, and Deng's mother would also happily tease her. She asked her sister-in-law: "Miss Yang wants to comb her braids?" Suddenly, one time when she moved things back to the mountain valley, Huihui firmly asked her sister-in-law to cut off her two braids. People in the two small houses heard that Miss Yang wanted to cut her braids, and they all gathered around curiously. Everyone felt that it would be good to cut off the two braids, but everyone knew that Huihui had deep feelings for these two braids, so although they agreed, they also expressed great regret; some said: "Miss Yang doesn't have to cut them, the situation looks like it will get better soon." Deng walked in from the outside and said, "Huihui, why do you have to cut them?" Huihui was hesitating, and when she heard Deng say this, she said to Deng: "Why shouldn't I cut them? Is it better to cut them, or is it better to be raped by someone? I want to cut them!" Her sister-in-law searched for scissors and stood behind Huihui, blushing at these words: "Miss Yang, then I'll cut them." Huihui gritted her teeth and said, "Cut!" Two crystal-clear tears rolled straight down her face. Her sister-in-law took the two braids and walked out the door. Huihui fell on the bed and cried loudly.

It turned out that this day, when they went home to move things, they were chased by five soldiers. Huihui heard someone behind her say: "There's a woman in front, with two braids, hurry up and chase after her?" Huihui knew the road well and ran back, her heart pounding in her mouth; so she decided to cut off her two braids. After that, Huihui's Western-style hair didn't look like Western-style hair, and people cast strange eyes on her. Huihui didn't pay much attention at first, but later she gradually became uneasy. Once, Deng and Huihui went out, because it was late and the sound of random gunfire was very dense, they did not return to the mountain valley. When they went back the next morning, they said they had spent the night at the house of another tenant named Li. Her sister-in-law casually asked how they slept? The Li tenant only had one torn mattress. Deng said: "We two slept in the same bed." A woman who was standing there was shocked: "You two slept in the same bed?" Deng felt that it was impossible to reason with this kind of woman, so he didn't explain. So the story spread, and it spread very quickly.

When people nearby saw Deng and Huihui walking together, they secretly exchanged the same opinions, saying: "They have already slept together...but!" Saying this, everyone couldn't help but say at the same time: "They are still a couple, a good couple."

Under these circumstances, Huihui couldn't stay any longer. Hearing these words, she also blushed. Finally, Huihui said goodbye to Deng's father and left alone.

Her sister-in-law was very worried about Huihui and asked Deng to escort Huihui out of the dangerous area.

Huihui soon arrived in Chongqing and heard that she had already gotten married this year.

After Deng sent Huihui away, he blamed himself very much, saying that he shouldn't have casually said those words in front of the neighbor woman, and that people in the countryside wouldn't understand young people.

Hearing the news of Huihui's marriage, Deng was very happy, but whenever he met people, he would always smile and say: "Having a wife like Huihui is mischievous all day long!"

### Two Christmas Carols

— Yan Yunran

Christmas Lament

Jesus descends in a Bethlehem cave

At midnight, all is quiet and still

The moon in the sky

Envelops the countryside in light

The wind blowing through the shepherd's shelter feels even colder

Originally coming to the valley for the sake of the world

But the hearts of the world are as hard as iron

Look how sad and pitiful the Holy Infant is

Jesus descends, alone in Bethlehem

Waiting quietly in the deep mountains for the world to come

But only the sound of the wind is heard, no human figures are seen

Smiling with tears in his eyes, facing the empty mountains

Extending small hands to bestow blessings and grace

Only because of deep affection, relying on hope day and night

Who knows that the world is numb and indifferent

Look how melancholy and sad the Holy Infant is

Jesus is born in a shepherd's shelter in the countryside

Hidden in a desolate mountain cave outside Bethlehem

Lonely and without anyone, the moon hangs at midnight

Drops of sour tears flow into the heart

For more than four thousand years, all people have yearned

But tonight, when he comes, they do not know where to seek him

Drunk and dreaming, lost and wandering

Look how the Holy Infant secretly grieves and weeps

Angels and Shepherds

Angels

Shepherds of Bethlehem, do not be alarmed

Announce to you the gospel of peace

For thousands of years, the Savior has been longed for

Tonight at midnight, he has descended

Descended in the icy suburbs of Bethlehem

Dwelling in a mountain cave, lying in a manger

All is silent and still

The bright moon drifts in the clear wind

Hurry forward, do not hesitate

The cave in front of the western mountains

Is where the Holy Infant is born

Shepherds

For four thousand years, we have awaited the Messiah

Tonight, he descends to the world

The angels announce he is in a mountain cave

The cave is in front of the western mountains

All is clear and still

The bright moon shines alone on me

Let us go together to the mountain cave

To worship the Lord of Heaven and Earth

Grace upon grace, praise upon praise

In this world, we see the little Holy Infant

Angels

Heavenly glory descends into the world

The mystery of the universe and the divine is revealed

The Holy Trinity looks down on the mortal world

The Messiah shines with joy and harmony

The sweet spring of peace flows from this moment

Flowing into pure hearts

A thousand autumns of endless water

Ten thousand ages of eternal serenity

The people of Bethlehem praise the Lord

Singing in unison to give thanks

For the infinite redemptive love of his birth

### Recommending a Solo Recital

— You Ting

—Professor Lu Zhu Hong, Baritone—

No matter how advanced instrumental music is, the feeling of intimacy and sincerity of vocal music is often incomparable to the pure expression of instrumental music. If you do not know how to appreciate the wonderful vocal music, you will not know the "magic" of music.

Anyone can learn vocal music, but only a few can become singers, because the innate vocal cords determine everything. In China, because most people are relatively weak, generally speaking, innate conditions make their pronunciation smaller, weaker, and looser than Westerners, and not as solid, strong, and powerful as Westerners. This can be distinguished in ordinary language pronunciation. Therefore, we can say this: Chinese people who study vocal music need more talent and more hard work.

There are not many Chinese singers, but in recent Shanghai, there are many individual solo recitals. I dare not say how good their achievements are, but it can be said that there are many geniuses among them. Those who have heard Si Yigui's baritone are very satisfied. Enthusiastic audiences hope that he can make more progress after he goes to the United States and not let "Lawrence Tibbett" have all the glory. At the same time, we hope to have more Si Yigui and better Si Yigui.

Here, I would like to recommend another unique genius—Professor Lu Chou Hong, a baritone singer. He has put in nine years of hard work in vocal music and is a proud student of Su Shilin, a famous teacher in Shanghai. To put it very simply, judging from his appearance, it may already be determined that he is physically qualified; just like Mr. Xu Mianqing, director of the Municipal Symphony Orchestra, his appearance is already a sign of a good baritone.

Mr. Lu is a "dramatic baritone." Those who have heard him sing praise his great efforts and beautiful timbre. In his technique, all aspects are expressed very richly. Whether it is timbre, tone, or expression, they are beyond the reach of ordinary poor singers. The success of any singer is mostly due to the "richness" of the expression in all aspects, because only by being "rich" can "power" be expressed. The quality of music depends on "power."

It is easy to sing small songs, but it is difficult to sing arias from operas. A good singer can cope with these arias with ease and without any effort. Lu Zhu Hong's achievement lies in his wide range, rich volume, and expression. He doesn't care much about the most difficult aria in the opera "Pagliacci." Therefore, this introduction is really not an intentional exaggeration!

On the evenings of the 27th and 28th, this rich and powerful "dramatic baritone" will appear in the Lyceum Theatre. In addition to several major programs such as the aria from "Un Ballo in Maschera" and the aria from Leoncavallo's "Pagliacci," there will also be the most popular folk song "Song of the Volga Boatmen" and Chinese songs. I think these wonderful performances will make countless music fans be intoxicated in the "magic of sound."

### An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of River, An Inch of Blood 133

— Ye Jingfeng

"So, who told you my address?"

"Teacher Aoki."

"Oh..."! Tsurumi became a little agitated again, "Who gave Elder Aoki the news"?

"Your Excellency yourself"!

"Who"? Tsurumi thought he heard it wrong.

"Big brother yourself"! Pingzi repeated.

"Nonsense"! Tsurumi spoke without thinking. When he said these two words, he felt that these two words blurted out were too harmful, so he immediately wanted to change his words and apologize to explain, but he heard the other party making a special surprised cry on the phone, which was like resentment and like surprise. This made Tsurumi stunned there, and he didn't know how to explain for a while, and the other party seemed to be stunned, chewing on the meaning of these two words.

Tsurumi casually said these two words, which were very ordinary, but why did it deserve such disrespect? He didn't know that since Tsurumi and Pingzi had a conversation on the beach under the moon last night, Tsurumi had already decided to treat Pingzi's entanglement with a "respect" attitude. But it was not a "respect and distance" method; because Tsurumi felt that Pingzi's talent and status could indeed be used, but he couldn't get close to her. Getting close to her would give Pingzi a chance to attack with love. Therefore, it is best to maintain a considerable distance between him and her, and build a "respect" wall in this distance to isolate the path of talking about love.

Unfortunately, such a good "trick," which took a lot of effort to calculate, was unintentionally destroyed under this sudden phone call. "Nonsense" these two words, from one side, were too disrespectful, and from the other side, they were too close, as close as the tone of family, father, son, close friends, and lovers. Too disrespectful or too close was not appropriate for Tsurumi.

"I'm really sorry, Pingzi... because I haven't rested all night, my nerves are not listening, and I used such inappropriate words"!

"Happy...? Why shouldn't I? Um?... But I also know... you think I shouldn't be so casual with you... In short, you still treat me as an annoying outsider... I also know that you will never give me a chance..." Her voice was a little off, as if she was sad?

"Hey... hey... Pingzi, you..." Tsurumi couldn't think of a suitable way to block her words for a while.

"Big brother, you are very busy, don't let my idle talk delay your business. Please use paper and pen to write down a few words that Teacher Aoki asked me to pass on to you..." There was no sound of speech, but it was the password that was knocked out on the phone with fingernails.

When Tsurumi heard this password method, he was greatly surprised, because what Pingzi used was exactly the special password that Tsurumi invented and thought could not be solved. So he quickly wrote it down with paper and pen:

"Yu'er, your plan will definitely have no results, and someone has already taken action in advance; the purpose is different, the goal is one. Therefore, you should end everything and return to the mainland quickly, and don't advance any further. The current situation is already set and it is difficult to turn the tide. This is what I deduced using the Zhou Tian Yigong mathematics, and you must believe it. Hao Ran the old man Inoue Aoki, showed".

This password was the crystallization of Tsurumi's hard work. The hidden song sentences were all in his stomach. As soon as he saw the number, he immediately wrote out the text. Fearing that the number was wrong, he immediately asked Pingzi to tap it again to correct it.

"Pingzi, I still have a question, can I ask you to explain it"?

"I know"! Pingzi giggled again. "You want to know where Teacher Aoki found out your secret from, don't you"?

"That's right, please teach me".

"It's still the same old saying, it was Big Brother himself who told him everything."

"You used mystery again"?

"Not at all wrong. At eight o'clock in the morning. He used me as a medium to perform a hypnosis; I'm afraid you were also sleeping at that time, so the results were very good. You didn't need to be forced at all, and you said everything in your heart."

### A Saint and a Sinner: The Love Story of George Eliot

— Translated by Yu Jing

Hollywood is hesitant, the reason being that they want to film a historical movie about the Victorian novelist George Eliot. Directors want to produce a film about the life of this famous novelist, but they cannot decide which George Eliot they should portray.

Should the film depict the George Eliot known to readers around the world through her works? Her readers considered her a guardian of strict morality, where a moral transgression was an indelible sin, and anyone committing an improper act should atone with their life.

Or should the film depict her life as known by many neighbors near the quiet Royal Park in London? To her neighbors, the famous novelist Marian Evans [Translator's note: This is her real name] was a licentious woman, living openly with another woman's husband near the legal wife's residence without any sense of shame.

However, this strange female writer did not worry that Hollywood directors would consider the contradictions in her dual life. She firmly believed in the morality in her own works, but she equally believed that the love with the man who could never marry her was the only happiness the world gave her.

Just as George Sand had her Chopin, George Eliot also had her George Henry Lewes.

If a smooth-talking philanderer were to comment, Marian Evans was not a captivating girl. She was already in her thirties when she fell in love, which was considered a scandal in London's literary circles at the time. Although she had a slender and healthy figure and a dignified face, she could not be called a beauty. Because she often browsed Greek and Latin literature, philosophy, and sociology, her large, blue-green eyes were somewhat nearsighted.

When she met Lewes at the home of a mutual friend, Chapman, she only admired and translated ancient texts and had not yet considered becoming a creative novelist. Shortly after they met, they developed feelings for each other, and their relationship lasted for twenty-five years, which is something a fickle girl could not achieve based on a momentary impulse. Lewes was said to have a slender figure, thick, curly hair, a mustache, and eyebrows, and there was some handsomeness about him.

Another point that needs to be mentioned is that Lewes' wife often went out with good friends, leaving him to raise three children. At that time, George Eliot's serious Puritan spirit and the nature of a witty essayist merged together, and they benefited greatly and found happiness in each other, fully developing their achievements to the highest point.

The following is an excerpt from George Eliot's biography in the famous women's biography written by Walter Brandes, depicting how the famous female writer defied Victorian England's morality and fell in love with that man, while making an evaluation of George Eliot's behavior that was both defensive and regretful.

"When Lewes was thirty years old, he had already engaged in criticism, novels, biographies, dramas, and philosophical research. He had traveled abroad, so his experience of human nature was very extensive. He had also stood on the podium and spoken to the masses, and he had also engaged in arduous and interesting reporting work. It is said that he even played the role of a clown in a traveling troupe.

"Because he was lively by nature and spoke freely, his enthusiasm, absurdity, and unrestrained talk and demeanor sometimes aroused the interest of his friends and sometimes surprised them."

"When George Eliot met this man, she felt extraordinary waves in her heart. She felt that this man was completely different from the men she had seen in her youth when she lived in Warwickshire and in the monastery where she grew up. She realized that a crisis was coming into her life. She had to make a decision privately to guide her behavior, which was not based on the general standards of morality in England at the time but on the harmony of her inner beliefs."

"It is likely that Mr. Lewes wrote her a letter explaining his situation and trying to persuade Miss Evans to be his life partner. Later, she agreed because she believed that it did not infringe on the rights of others. She became his wife, but could not become a legal wife because he could not divorce."

"This caused great shock among her friends. For example, Mrs. Bray and her sister gradually restored their close friendship with her after understanding that her conscience was still so perfect."

"George Eliot was such an extremely sensitive woman, and this matter must have caused her particularly painful suffering. She did not realize that her behavior was wrong. She gained perfect spiritual friendship from the man she loved. However, taking such a bold step created a deep rift between her and many relatives, which was enough to disturb her brave nature. Her companions were very in awe of her seriousness, but she sacrificed morality for love, causing great panic among her companions, as if the sky had fallen."

When she called herself "Mrs. Lewes," it was considered the third time she had changed her name without legal approval. Her baptismal name was Mary Ann, and she changed it to Marian, reportedly because the latter was more beautiful.

Her male pen name, George Eliot, was probably not only to hide her real name but also to avoid being discovered about her affair with Lewes. However, this wish was shattered after her famous work Adam Bede was printed.

In 1858, Mr. MacArthur said in her biography: "Everyone is guessing, but most of them are guessing wrong. Because everyone is paying attention to George Eliot's book A Sketch of Clerical Life."

Mr. MacArthur wrote in her biography: "At that time, only Charles Dickens pointed to this secret clue and said: If these two volumes of novels were not written by a woman, I am willing to admit that I am a woman!"

A year later, the secret was revealed. That was the publication of Adam Bede, with the first title writing: "To my dear husband, George Henry Lewes."

Those titles said: "Dedicated to my dear husband, George Henry Lewes, if it were not for his love that gave my life happiness, I would never have been able to write these manuscripts. Marian Lewes." (Translated from magazine digests)

### Compassion

— Millais

Millais (E. Millais 1829-1896) was an outstanding figure painter in 19th-century England, as famous as Rossetti, and considered a member of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. His noble character and poetic decoration are expressed in his paintings. This painting, originally named Mercy-Saint Bartholomew's day, depicts a massacre during the French religious revolution. The situation is vivid, and the picture is compact. It can be called a representative work of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. (Lion)

### Candy and Dance

— Shao Fu

A female employee of the Sullivan Candy Company told me:

On the day before St. John's Day (the 24th), chocolate alone sold for more than 1.7 million yuan in one afternoon. Many customers waited in front of the counter. As soon as the factory delivered the candy, it was snatched up before it was even unpacked. The factory production could not keep up, otherwise even more could have been sold.

I was not surprised when she told me this. I coldly asked her how much chocolate cost per pound. She said 10,000 yuan. I said, "It's only a little over 1,700 pounds, what's so strange about that?"

Indeed, there are too many people in Shanghai who can afford chocolate that costs 10,000 yuan per pound, and it's more than just these 1,700 people.

From the small to the big, the consumption in other aspects this Christmas is really unknown!

However, the market is still sluggish. On Christmas Eve, at around ten o'clock, I went to a large dance hall with a few friends for sightseeing. There were only a few guests in the seats. Although the musicians were playing enthusiastically, the desolate atmosphere could not be dispelled. The dancers said when they saw the guests: "Business is bad!" Compared with today last year, this scene is really unbearable to look back on.

The above two examples can be said to be a unity of contradictions, fully illustrating the economic chaos of Shanghai society. Mencius said: "Eating and sex are human nature." Eating still ranks first. If you look at it superficially, Shanghainese would rather eat candy, and whether they can dance is secondary. In economic terms, one pound of chocolate can be universally tasted by big and small people, while a moment of pleasure in the dance hall costs more than 10,000 yuan and only pleases one person.

But this cannot be used to explain the current economic situation.

Anecdotes from Various Countries

### Between Men and Women, Joys and Sorrows, Separations and Reunions, Nothing is Surprising

— Translated by Chun Liang from the December issue of International Digest

In Canada, it is a paradise for married people. On average, one in every 161 marriages ends in divorce; in the UK, it's one in 96; in Sweden, it's one in 33; in Norway, it's one in 30; in Germany, it's one in 24; in France, it's one in 21. Finally, in the US, an average of one in seven marriages ends in divorce.

A Scottish girl once pretended to be another woman. She hid her true identity and lured her husband to spend the night in a hotel, and tried to get as many people as possible to see it. Later, she accused her husband of having an affair and filed for divorce. However, this trick was discovered, and she was sentenced to six months in prison.

In Calcutta, a seventeen-year-old woman named Gorselye Gomi filed for divorce, accusing her ten-year-old husband, Liki Cang Gomi, of being unable to support their living expenses.

In Charleston, a woman filed for divorce from her husband, accusing him of kicking her. As a result, she lost her case. Because the judge noticed that the man was a cripple with only one leg.

In the city of Burgago in Yugoslavia, a 111-year-old Jura was involved in a divorce case, accused of enticing women. The fact is that Martin, 98, and Qiuya, 95, had a quarrel. Qiuya ran to Jura after being scolded by her husband. Because Jura had been a bachelor for her whole life and had always hoped that Qiuya would marry him one day.

In San Jose, California, USA, a man filed for divorce, accusing his wife of bringing her beloved monkey to bed every night. The judge instead sided with his wife, granting her the rights she was entitled to. Because the judge thought that if a man did not have the courage and ability to kick a little monkey out of bed, could that man be considered a "real man"?

In the city of Guanajuato in Mexico, a simple letter stating "incompatibility" can be mailed to request a divorce and get it approved.

In Reno, the famous divorce city, there was once a day when 58 divorce cases were resolved in just one day.

Hollywood movie stars, based on the average annual marriage rate, have 54 divorces out of 65 marriages. It is said that movie stars remarrying after divorce does not affect their reputation. And fans do not blame movie stars for not getting married.

In Switzerland, 73 women who had been divorced for five years were asked about their feelings about divorce. Forty-one women felt regretful, 25 women felt happy with their free life, and seven women returned to their husbands.

In Elizabeth, USA, an 82-year-old Mrs. Osborne was granted a divorce. The reason for the divorce was: her husband always insisted on knowing where she was going and who she was with when she went out.

In Connecticut (USA), Mrs. Fulton had a habit of kissing a kangaroo before kissing her husband, John. So John Fulton got his divorce request approved.

In Missouri (USA), a deaf and mute husband filed for divorce from his deaf and mute wife, accusing her of constantly scolding him with silent sign language.

In Iroquois, if an Indian woman wants to divorce her husband, she only needs to place his riding gear and all his personal belongings outside the house. After seeing this hint, the husband will automatically leave.

In Barbados, the locals handle divorces themselves. A couple divides the house in the middle with a boundary line, the husband moves in his half of the house, and the wife lives in the other half.

In Siam, if a man feels a little tired of his wife, he can sell her publicly. However, the woman he married for the first time must be legally divorced.

In Italy, a man was granted a divorce because his wife kept thirteen life-size Buddha statues in the bedroom.

Many fashionable women in Paris have created a "divorce ring," which is made of white gold and worn on the little finger of the right hand. Because these divorced wives want to let those young men know that they are free people who can marry at any time.

### The Organization of Beggars 19

— Huang Jiamo

Street Performance Begging (Part 1)

In the local hardcore beggar gangs, the begging methods they practice still follow the traditions of the Jianghu. The sects are divided into eighteen categories, called the "Eighteen Sects of the Jianghu." These are listed and explained below:—

(1) "Singing Daoqing" — This is a refined singing beggar gang, including those who sing "Yunhua Luo." Their tools are divided into "three woods" and "leather tubes." The three woods are used to sing "Yunhua Luo," and the fixed lyrics cover a wide range of topics. When the beggar walks to the door of each industry's store, he must sing the lyrics of that industry. And it must be relevant and appropriate, and it must not be perfunctory by putting Zhang's hat on Li's head. If the store does not give him money, he will also make a few jokes in the lyrics, and even make vicious insults. The store can't do anything about him. "Leather tube" is used to sing Daoqing. They are considered civilized people, and they wear long gowns to show their class difference from the common flow. They don't take the money with their hands, but clip it into the tube with a tube board. This is the rule of the gang. The lyrics are indeed Daoqing tunes, and the material is also taken from ancient people's stories. Store owners are happy to give alms when they encounter beggars who sing Daoqing. Because these people are neat and tidy, and they are not annoying. But to be able to sing the lyrics, you must be literate. And you must be able to adapt to the situation. Those who are not very literate are not qualified to be in this role.

(2) "Swallowing Swords and Bullets" — This sect is also called "Jiali Shou." Their behavior is similar to "Shandong people changing tricks, wanting money but not their lives." They scare people by swallowing swords and iron bullets. Swallowing swords is called "long strips," and swallowing bullets is called "containing groups." When these beggars come to the door, they all say: "Boss, please give me something." They don't say anything else. They leave when they are given money. If they are not given money, they will use a two-foot-long knife and a walnut-sized iron bullet, and aim it straight into the throat. Then tears and snot flow out together. They won't leave unless they are given more money.

(3) "Soft and Hard Martial Arts" — This gang is divided into two factions: soft and hard. "Soft Martial Arts" beggars carry small eighteen weapons with them, and use a spear to stand upright on the top of their heads. "Hard Martial Arts" beggars don't carry any tools. When they go to the store or house, they can take any object and hold it on the tip of their noses without letting it fall. They can hold a ten-pound door bolt and an extremely sharp meat axe. This relies on real skills, which is not comparable to soft martial arts.

(4) "Water Flower Bowl" — It is said to be a technical performance similar to a Jianghu troupe, divided into two factions: "Big Flower" and "Small Flower." "Big Flower" uses two large bowls of water, tied with ropes. They are swung left and right, and rotated into a ring shape. It is considered real skill if the water does not pour out. "Small Flower" uses a bowl to hold the paste, and there is a hook at the end. The hook is planted on the arm, holding a bowl of water. Fresh blood drips from the arm, making people feel pitiful and give him money. In fact, there is already a small hole in the arm, like the hole in a woman's ear for earrings. When he goes out, he rubs some pig blood on it, which looks like a new tattoo. This can be said to be "man-made self-flowing blood," just to deceive passersby.

(5) "Real and Fake Dogs" — This sect takes dogs out to beg for money, calling the dog "strip." In the beggar gang, they are considered elder brothers. They cannot be filled by young beggars. They rely on dogs to eat, calling dogs "wooden money." They can only go to the streets to respond to the market after they have been tamed. They run when told to run, and jump when told to jump. To amuse the people in the store's residence. In addition, there is another kind of beggar who wears a dog's head to beg, and sings a song of barking:—

"Wang wang has wealth and fragrance!

Buzzing dog comes to wealth!

Boss gives money to raise the dog."

These people actually voluntarily transform themselves into dogs in order to get money. Their behavior is unbearable to the human eye. In the gang, they are called "Zhuang Tiao," which is no different from beasts in clothing.

### Women in the Eyes of Scientists

— Yun Bei

I recently obtained a magazine from a friend, and when I opened it, it was the annual journal of the Engineering Society of the University of London this year. There is a short article analyzing women with "scientific methods," and the content is very "cute." I translated it to enrich the "Free Talk."

Element: Woman.

Existence: Can be found wherever men exist.

Rarely exists in an uncombined free state. With a few exceptions, it is combined with other things.

Physical properties: Color, shape, size, age, are all uncertain.

The surface is covered with a thin layer of greasy fat.

It can be made to be depressed and frozen (freeze) at any time, but with proper treatment, it can be thawed and renewed.

Chemical properties: Very active.

Extremely fond of combining with valuable items such as gold, silver, platinum, and high-priced minerals.

If left alone, the face turns blue.

Insoluble in water, but when ethanol (alcohol) is combined with it, its activity will be greatly enhanced.

Sometimes it does not exert resistance (pressure).

Extremely perishable, the appearance will change greatly in ten years. The fresh ones have great magnetism. Precautions: In the hands of inexperienced people, this element is similar to advanced explosives.

### What is "Qiushi"? An Explanation from Traditional Chinese Medicine

I saw the article "Stealing Urine to Make Secret Medicine" in this newspaper on the 21st, and I felt that the discussion of making "Qiushi" was not detailed enough, so I am supplementing it now.

According to traditional Chinese medicine, there are three kinds of medicines made from human urine: (1) Urine. (2) Niao Bai Zhu. (3) That is, "Qiushi."

Urine is called Reincarnation Wine or Returning Yuan Soup by experts. There are many therapeutic effects recorded in the medical books. In fact, it is very effective in treating bruises and injuries. Other claims are a bit exaggerated.

Niao Bai Zhu is called Renzhong Bai, which is an essential medicine used in the throat department of Chinese medicine, and it is also used to treat diabetes. However, Chinese medicine practitioners rarely use it in internal medicine prescriptions.

As for the name Qiushi, it is actually borrowed. It is the essence of the alchemists' alchemy in ancient times. Because of its white color and firmness, it is named "Qiushi." Therefore, Huainanzi said: "The elixir is called Qiushi."

As for the crystals made from urine, the shape and color are the same as those made by alchemists, so they are also called "Qiushi." How is Qiushi made from urine? Li Shizhen's Compendium of Materia Medica in the Ming Dynasty says it in great detail. I will record it below:

"Qiushi must be taken from boys' urine in the autumn moon. Put seven qian of gypsum powder in each jar, and use mulberry branches to clear and settle it. Pour off the clear liquid, do this two or three times, then add a barrel of autumn dew water and stir it to clear it: do this several times, remove the dregs and dirt, reduce the salty taste, spread it on heavy paper and dry it on the ashes, completely take up the light and clear ones at the top as "Qiushi." Scrape off the heavy and turbid ones at the bottom. The ancients established the name based on this meaning. Men use boys' urine, and women use boys' urine." Only such a treatment can be called authentic. In addition to this, there are some unscrupulous merchants who make shoddy products and make tricky methods:

"...Doctors in the world do not take Qiushi in the autumn, but collect people's urine, but use soap pod water to clear, dry, and refine it, and burn it for Yang refining, which is completely lost in the way. How can it fit the name! The matchmaker is detrimental to people, how can it respond to the disease?" Like this kind of inferior product, there are also forgeries made by changing Renzhong Bai. Taking it is harmful and useless, and it is even more a matter of intention.

The efficacy of this product is stated in the Compendium of Materia Medica: "It mainly treats deficiency and cold diseases, urinary incontinence, spermatorrhea, nourishes kidney water, nourishes Dantian, returns to the original, returns to life, calms the five viscera, moistens the three jiaos, eliminates phlegm and cough, reduces bone steaming, softens hard lumps, brightens the eyes, clears the heart..." (But very few doctors and users use it.)

Ordinary swollen patients should avoid salt, so some people use Qiushi instead of salt to cook vegetables for patients. If this product is used as an elixir for prolonging life, then it is extremely foolish!

In major traditional Chinese medicine stores, a piece of one or two qian in size can be bought for one or two thousand yuan. Its shape is quite like rock candy. Good-hearted gentlemen, why not buy a piece to see for yourself? If medical scientists or chemists study its ingredients and medicinal effects, it will save me and others a lot of suspicion! (Li Renzhong)

### Suggestion

— Xiao Wan

There is a large open space in front of the Huangpu Sub-bureau facing Jinling East Road. This place is located in the central district and has good Feng Shui. If the municipal government and the police bureau allow vendors to set up stalls here, wouldn't it really give them strong assistance? In this way, on the one hand, it shows the methods that the authorities give to the vendors, and on the other hand, it shows that the vendors and the police have reconciled, everyone is smiling, all the accumulated grievances have disappeared, and harmony generates wealth!

However, let me declare: I am not a vendor.

### Vice Minister Gan Naiguang

— Gan Lai

"Down with the great powers, down with the great powers, eliminate the warlords, eliminate the warlords, the National Revolution succeeds, the National Revolution succeeds, sing joyfully, sing together joyfully."

The author of this well-known National Revolution song, familiar to women and children, is none other than the current Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Gan Naiguang. It was hastily drafted in 1925 before the Central Party Headquarters held a party congress in Guangzhou. From this, one can glimpse his talent.

Mr. Gan once served as a political instructor at the Whampoa Military Academy. He is not only skilled in rhetoric, but also fluent and readable in writing. In the past, he deeply earned the trust of the late martyr Liao Zhongkai. Mr. Gan is currently 50 years old, from Cenxi County, Guangxi Province, and a graduate of Guangzhou Lingnan University. After graduation, he served as a professor of economics at the university and authored "A History of Pre-Qin Economic Thought" and "Several Fundamental Problems of the Chinese Kuomintang." His translated works include "A History of British Political Parties" and "Outline of Artistic Photography." His talent and learning can be described as extensive. In addition, he has authored many pamphlets on party affairs, hence the title "Theoretician of the Three Principles of the People." At that time, his prominence even surpassed that of the "old-brand" theoretician Dai Jitao and others.

He enjoys photography and composing new poetry. His skill in the former has already reached the level of an expert.

This summer, he was appointed as our country's special envoy to attend the celebration of Philippine independence. He has recently developed a hobby of collecting stamps.
