### The National Assembly Preparations Are Actively Underway; Most Representatives Have Been Selected; The Lists of Various Parties Are Being Expedited

[Our newspaper's Nanjing dispatch on the 5th] The convocation order for the National Assembly was not issued on the 2nd as scheduled. The government is currently discussing the matter to ensure perfection. On the morning of the 2nd, Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Lisheng, Chen Lifu, Shao Lizi, Lei Zhen, Hong Lanyou, and others gathered on the second floor of the Central Party Headquarters to discuss the issue until 12:00 noon. Afterwards, they declined to offer any opinions. According to what this reporter has learned, the National Assembly Organization Law only stipulates that the National Assembly is convened by the National Government, without specifying a convocation date. Furthermore, the period for representatives to register is only set as "before the 10th." Therefore, according to the Organization Law, it would not be impossible to issue the convocation order as late as November 1st. However, when it was previously decided to hold the meeting on May 5th, the convocation order was issued on March 25th, and registration was set for April 25th. Therefore, if the above decision is taken as an example, the current timeline is indeed too tight. However, given the current situation, the government is still considering whether to take the next step. According to the person in charge of the National Assembly election authority, most of the representatives have already been selected, and the lists of various parties are being expedited. Some say that it is possible to issue the convocation order on October 12th and hold the opening ceremony as scheduled, then temporarily suspend the meeting and reconvene it after the national issues are resolved. However, whether this approach is feasible is currently unknown. It is also rumored that Chairman Deng Zhong, regarding this preliminary constitutional National Assembly, has been paying close attention to it recently.

The Convocation Order for the National Assembly Will Be Announced; A Decision Can Be Made Before the 12th

[Our newspaper's Nanjing dispatch on the 4th] Hong Lanyou stated on the 4th that the date for the announcement of the National Assembly convocation order will definitely be determined before the 12th. Regarding the request of alternate National Assembly representatives to attend the meeting, Hong said that it would be decided by the National Assembly Presidium, but there is no provision for alternate representatives in the organizational law.

[Our newspaper's Nanjing dispatch on the 5th] As of noon, the Communist Party has not yet sent a formal reply to the government's statement issued on the 2nd. The attitude of the Communist Party can already be seen in the remarks made yesterday by Chen Jiakang, the Communist Party's spokesperson in Shanghai. Tonight, Mei Yi, the spokesperson for the Communist Party delegation here, stated that the formal reply has not yet arrived. Currently, we have two goals: first, an urgent demand for a ceasefire in Zhangjiakou. If the war continues, the future is truly unimaginable. Second, this ceasefire should be unconditional and should be implemented immediately, not after the military operations have reached the suburbs of Zhangjiakou. He also stated that the Communist Party's memorandum to the government regarding the ceasefire in Zhangjiakou has not yet received a response from the government. At 4:00 PM on the 5th, Wang Bingnan visited Ambassador Stuart based on the above two points and exchanged views on the ceasefire issue.

### Three-Quarters of the 2,050 Representatives Have Been Elected

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] With the National Assembly about to convene, the selection of various representatives is being expedited by the relevant authorities. According to the provisions of the election law and the agreements of the Political Consultative Conference, the National Assembly will have a total of 2,050 representatives. Currently, 1,566 representatives have been legally selected, while 484 have not yet been selected. Regarding the selection of National Assembly representatives and the distribution of their quotas, the person in charge of the National Assembly Election Office recently provided the following details to this reporter: The number of National Assembly representatives, according to the revised and promulgated National Assembly Representative Election Law of May 1937, was originally distributed as follows: 1. 665 representatives elected by regional election methods (including 30 units in various provinces and cities). 2. 380 representatives elected by occupational election methods (including various agricultural, industrial, and commercial groups in various provinces and cities and national freelance professional groups). 3. 145 representatives elected by special election methods (including 45 from the Northeast, 40 from Mongolia and Tibet, 40 from overseas Chinese, and 30 from the military). 4. 240 representatives designated by the National Government, for a total of 1,440 representatives. Except for item 4, 1,200 representatives should be selected according to the procedures stipulated in the election law. In 1937, due to the situation, only 950 representatives were selected. Furthermore, due to changes in the situation over the past nine years, some representatives in various regions have defected, died, or been removed from office, and there were no alternates to fill the vacancies, resulting in 28 vacancies. Therefore, only 922 of the originally elected representatives remain. In January of this year, the government convened a political consultative conference with various parties, and there was an agreement on the number of National Assembly representatives. In addition to retaining the 1,200 representatives stipulated in the original election law, the 240 representatives designated by the government were canceled and changed to: 1. 700 representatives directly selected by the National Government, including the following: A. 320 representatives of the Kuomintang. B. 190 representatives of the Communist Party. C. 120 representatives of the Democratic League. D. 100 representatives of the Youth Party. E. 70 representatives of non-party and non-factional social elites. 2. 150 representatives added in accordance with the supplementary regulations attached to the election amendment, including the following: (1) 17 newly added representatives from Taiwan (together with the 1 representative stipulated in the election law to be elected by overseas Chinese and allocated to Taiwan, totaling 18 representatives). (2) 77 newly added representatives from the twelve provinces and cities of the Northeast (together with the original quota of 45 representatives from the provinces and cities of the Northeast stipulated in the election law, totaling 122 representatives from the provinces and cities of the Northeast). (3) 6 representatives from Chongqing City (the election law stipulated that the city did not elect representatives separately). (4) 3 newly added occupational representatives from Xikang Province. (5) 1 representative from Ereen Banner. (6) 1 representative from the Amdo Tibetan area. (7) 1 representative from overseas Chinese in the United Kingdom. (8) 1 representative from overseas Chinese from Yunnan in Burma. (9) 10 representatives from indigenous ethnic groups in the six provinces of Yunnan, Guizhou, Xikang, Sichuan, Hunan, and Guangxi. (10) 10 newly added representatives from the military. (11) 20 women representatives. The above items added a total of 850 representatives, which, together with the 1,200 representatives originally stipulated in the election law, totaled 2,050 representatives. Now that the government has decided to hold the National Assembly on November 12th as scheduled, the selection of various representatives is being expedited by the National Assembly Election Office. As of now, a total of 1,566 representatives have been legally selected, of which 1,035 have been announced, and 531 are about to be announced. In addition, among the 484 representatives who have not yet been selected, 190 are Communist Party representatives, 120 are Democratic League representatives, and 100 are Youth Party representatives, totaling 410, who have not yet submitted their lists. The remaining 74 representatives who have not yet been selected are also being expedited separately. It is expected that all of them can be selected before the start of the assembly registration, so as not to affect the number of attendees.

The National Army moving south from Songlin Shop recovered Dingxing Station on the morning of the 5th and continued to advance, and Beihe Shop can be quickly recovered as well. On the morning of the 5th, a considerable force moved south from Fengtai to provide reinforcements. Fangshun Bridge was captured by the Communist army at 9:00 PM on the 4th. Currently, Xushui, Gucheng, and Wangdu are still in the hands of the Communist army. Caohe was recovered once, but then fell again. There was fierce fighting all day on the 5th in Yujiazhuang. There was fighting within five kilometers around Baoding. The Communist army was still fiercely attacking at 2:00 AM on the 5th, five miles northwest of the city, attempting to actively threaten the provincial government's location. The armored car on the Haizi machine between Songlin Shop and Zhuoxian struck a mine at 2:00 AM on the 5th. Fortunately, it did not derail, only destroying one locomotive, and the track was also damaged. Reinforcements moving north from Shizhuang are heading north to Xinle.

[Central News Agency, Baoding, 5th] The war situation around Baoding is as follows: (1) In Daran Village, eighteen li south of the city, and the Yujiazhuang area southwest of the city, the Communist army gathered its forces on the morning of the 5th and launched a fierce attack on the National Army.

### Fierce Fighting in Southeastern Chahar Province; Fu Zuoyi Cables That Nanchaoqian Has Been Recovered; Chen Cheng Holds a Military Conference in Beiping

[Our newspaper's Beiping dispatch on the 5th] As of noon on the 5th, the war in Chahar Province, southeastern part, was still raging in the areas around Wuziying, Maquanzi, Huoshaoying, and Xinzhuang, about five li east of Huailai City. The National Army arrived in this area on the 2nd and has been engaged in a tug-of-war with the Communist army for four days, which has been quite fierce, showing the Communist army's determination to hold Zhangjiakou. The National Army also sent another force north from Nankou, and is currently engaged in fierce fighting with the Communist army in the area twenty li south of Yanqing. The Communist army in the Huailai area has thirty regiments, more than 30,000 people, personally commanded by Nie Rongzhen, and their designation is the Ji-Cha-Wei-Jiang Two Columns. In addition, the Communist army has increased its forces by six regiments in the areas northeast of Nankou and Changping, attempting to disrupt the rear. According to a cable sent by Fu Zuoyi yesterday to the relevant parties here, the cavalry regiment recovered Nanchaoqian in southwestern Chahar on the 1st and is continuing to advance. Nanchaoqian belongs to Shangdu and is a must-contend place in this battle. According to a military strategist who is directing operations in Chahar Province this time, based on past combat experience, the National Army on this route may tend towards Wanquan. Once Wanquan is taken, it can take a commanding position and directly attack Zhangjiakou. In the past, the struggle for Zhangjiakou has also taken this route, so taking Zhangjiakou from this route will be faster than other routes. The military authorities also stated that the too rapid progress in western Chahar may affect the "decisive battle" in eastern Chahar. According to Communist personnel, the Communist army's combat principle is to use troops along the "exchange of interests line," that is, to avoid the heavy and take the light, and not hesitate to abandon strongholds. Therefore, the outcome of the decisive battle in eastern Chahar is still unpredictable, but it is clear that the main force of the Communist army is deployed in eastern Chahar. Regarding the Communist army's retreat after losing Zhangjiakou, it is generally said that it will be in the area of Yuxian and even Taishan. The arrival of Chief of Staff Chen in Beiping will bring the Chahar-Hebei war to an early end.

[Our newspaper's Beiping dispatch on the 5th] Amid the tense atmosphere of the Chahar-Hebei war, Chief of Staff Chen Cheng flew to Beiping from Beijing last night around 7:00 PM. Only Commander Sun Lianzhong went to the airport to welcome him, and few outside knew about it. The two entered the city directly to the Beiping Executive Headquarters, and the news was that Chen was presiding over a military conference, with Director Li Zongren and the chief of staff of the Executive Headquarters attending. Chen spent the night at Sun Lianzhong's residence and continued the meeting on the 5th. It is not yet known when Chen will leave Beiping.

[United Press, Beiping, 5th] Chief of Staff Chen Cheng flew from Nanjing to Beiping on the orders of Chairman Chiang, accompanied by many personnel, to direct the Baoding war.

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 5th] Semi-official sources say that the National Army advancing towards Zhangjiakou has gradually gained the upper hand in the past 24 hours after capturing Shacheng, 43 miles southeast of the city, and Nanchaoqian, 40 miles northwest. Fu Zuoyi's troops are advancing towards Zhangbei, and Sun Lianzhong's troops are pressing towards Xuanhua.

However, when they were about to depart on the morning of the 5th, the Communist representative Zhang Songtao falsely claimed that the preparations were inadequate and refused to depart. As a result, only the American representative, Colonel Hurns, and the government representative, Lieutenant Colonel Ma Junzhi, departed by car. However, because the bridge at kilometer 52 east of Tiande Station on the Siping-Meihekou road was destroyed by the Communist Army, they could not proceed and returned to Siping at 3:00 PM in the afternoon.

[Another dispatch] According to a telephone call from Siping, regarding the capture of Xifeng County by the Communist Army, the government representative of the 28th Small Group of the Military Mediation Department, Ma Junzhi, in addition to submitting a memorandum to the American representative, Colonel Hurns, also lodged a serious protest to the Communist representative, Zhang Songtao, demanding that the Communist Army withdraw unconditionally, and sternly condemned the Communist Army's illegal action in attacking Xifeng. Otherwise, the Communist Army would bear full responsibility for any serious incidents that may arise.

### A Strong Navy Benefits World Peace; The Construction of Coastal Defense Cannot Be Delayed; Gui Yongqing Talks About How We Should Seize the Opportunity

[Our newspaper's Nanjing dispatch on the 5th] Vice Admiral Gui Yongqing, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, met with this reporter at 5:00 PM on the 5th to discuss his thoughts and plans for building a new navy in the future. He stated: "In addition to requiring developed industry, abundant financial resources, and sufficient talent, a good international environment is especially important for the establishment of a navy. Before the war, all of our national defense construction was strongly hindered by the Japanese invaders. Now, all the major powers of the world are allies, and because of this war, they all know that if China has a strong navy, it will actually benefit world peace. Therefore, the current international situation is the best opportunity for us to build coastal defense. The first problem we encounter in this major task is manpower. The training of naval personnel must emphasize both technology and will. In the future, naval education must be improved day by day, and it is planned to establish connections with relevant departments of various universities to recruit outstanding young people to participate in naval construction. Secondly, shipbuilding. If we want to seek the development and independence of the Chinese navy in the future, we must be able to set up factories to build ships and cannot rely on foreign countries for everything. This will start with maintenance and repair and gradually expand until we can manufacture ships ourselves. Thirdly, the establishment of a management system, which is a necessary condition for any military service. The scope of the navy is especially broad. Without a transparent, efficient, and practical management system, building a new navy will be impossible. The Navy General Headquarters is currently changing its organization and will set up five departments and eight divisions, which are expected to be completed within the next week. In the future, it will follow the instructions of the Chairman and Commander-in-Chief Chen, and actively carry out work with the assistance of compatriots across the country and various allies." He concluded by saying that once the official duties in the General Headquarters are in order, he plans to go to various naval bases and ports to inspect, so as to truly understand the current situation of the navy and promote outstanding personnel on the spot.

### Change of Command Ceremony for the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CNRRA); Addresses by Outgoing and Incoming Directors, Mr. Huo and Mr. Chiang, Encouraging Colleagues

[Report from Our Newspaper] When CNRRA Director Chiang Ting-fu recently went to Nanjing, he was instructed by Premier Song to first handle the change of command. Therefore, at 3:00 PM yesterday, accompanied by the newly appointed Director Huo Baoshu, he held the change of command ceremony in the conference room on the fourth floor of CNRRA headquarters. All 700+ CNRRA staff members in Shanghai attended. As of today, Director Huo officially assumes his duties.

Mr. Chiang's Farewell Remarks

Mr. Chiang stated briefly in his address: The main purpose of today's ceremony is to give everyone the opportunity to meet the new Director. Before the new Director speaks, I would like to say a few words to express my sincere feelings. Over the past year, colleagues in the headquarters and various branch offices have made their best efforts to promote the work of CNRRA and have made many sacrifices. I would like to thank them for this. CNRRA is a large-scale service organization, so those who participate in its work must take the spirit of service as their fundamental principle. I sincerely hope that you will remove prejudices of party affiliation and political views and continue to serve humanity. If the new Director welcomes you to continue to participate in CNRRA's work, then I sincerely hope that you will continue to work with peace of mind and with the same spirit of service. Deputy Director Li has jointly planned CNRRA's work with me. Now that he has been appointed by the government, he should continue CNRRA's work. As for myself, the government has given me the opportunity to serve humanity. Now that you have the opportunity to serve humanity, you should continue to work hard. The new Director has more experience than I do and is fully capable of CNRRA's work, and his performance will certainly be better than mine.

Mr. Huo's Speech

Mr. Huo's speech stated briefly: CNRRA is an organization born out of the times. It is a relief organization established based on the Atlantic Charter. Its main purpose is to serve the people. Director Chiang once said, "From a historical perspective, there will inevitably be years of famine after a major war. This kind of post-war disaster will last for 30 to 50 years. I am determined to help humanity reduce this post-war disaster and shorten its duration from decades to two or three years." I know that CNRRA's work is the most arduous work in history. At the same time, there are various difficulties that prevent its work from being fully deployed, and the general public does not easily understand these difficulties. Director Chiang has laid the foundation for us. Now that he is unwilling to continue working for personal reasons, and I, as someone outside of government, have been ordered by the government to succeed Mr. Chiang in leading CNRRA, I sincerely hope that you will help me accelerate the completion of CNRRA's mission. Today, I have three hopes for CNRRA's work: (1) to establish close ties with UNRRA and all parties and to integrate with UNRRA's work; (2) to discuss work openly. The amount of CNRRA's materials and the situation are unclear to all parties, and there are excessive demands. In the future, we must generally discuss and study work with the public; (3) I hope that you will work harder and with peace of mind, race against time, reduce human suffering, and assist in world peace. In addition, I have two points to express to CNRRA colleagues: First, I hope that there will be no major changes in personnel. I hope you will help me with my work as you helped Director Chiang; second, in order to race against time, CNRRA's work period is already very short. I hope that you will complete urgent and important work as soon as possible, coordinate work with action, and complete CNRRA's work plan. What I have said below is not only my hope, but also Director Chiang's hope, and even more so the mission that the government has given us. Finally, I hope that Mr. Chiang will give me instructions at any time and in any place.

### CNRRA Food Survey Team Report: Famine Threatens Hunan, Guangxi, and Guangdong; National Relief Grain Needs Exceed 800,000 Tons

[Report from This City] According to a report from the CNRRA Food Survey Team: Hunan, Guangxi, and Guangdong provinces still face a famine crisis this winter. This year's national grain harvest is only about 10% less than in peacetime. The grain harvest in some provinces is more than 40% less. Floods and the lack of seeds, agricultural tools, and fertilizers are the main reasons for the poor harvest. It is estimated that the country will need 812,000 tons of relief grain to supply our farmers to get through this winter and next spring. Based on current transportation capacity limitations, CNRRA and UNRRA can supply 553,000 tons of food by next spring, which is still 250,000 tons short of the total national grain needs. The grain needs in various parts of the country, except for a few counties in Jiangxi province that have surplus harvests, are insufficient in other provinces such as Hebei, Rehe, Chahar, Suiyuan, Taiwan, the Nine Northeastern Provinces, Hunan, Henan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Anhui, Hubei, Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangsu, etc. The grain needs in Shanghai alone are estimated at around 4,000 tons. Since the start of its work, CNRRA has distributed a total of 559,492 tons of grain to various parts of the country by the beginning of September. As of September 15, 520,061 tons unloaded by UNRRA at various ports in China are being distributed by CNRRA to various regions or are being reassembled. UNRRA shipments to China that need to be reassembled include approximately 8,111 tons of agricultural machinery, mostly agricultural tractors. CNRRA has distributed 1 million pounds of seeds, enough to plant 2 million mu of land, to farmers across the country. Other items include 552,000 pounds of pesticides and 64,169,000 pounds of fertilizer, which have also been distributed by CNRRA to various regions for use.

### Missing Plane of China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC); Search Yields No Results; Obstruction by the Lolo People in Puge

[United Press, Chongqing, 5th] According to sketchy news received here today, CNAC Flight 81 crashed in the wilderness of the Lolo area on the 15th. The personnel and passengers on board, in addition to being frightened, also exchanged fire with the Lolo people. CNAC has dispatched a transport plane to rescue them in order to determine whether the pilot, Long Barton, and the passengers are safe. However, yesterday's reconnaissance yielded no results. The CNAC rescue plane was piloted by American pilot Bo Smith. The plane dropped a long strip of cloth with messages written in Chinese and the Lolo language, meaning that if there were any survivors from the plane that crashed in the Lolo area, they could send a signal. The Lolo people, upon seeing this, fired at the plane, hitting the tail. In addition to Bo Smith, the pilots of the CNAC rescue plane included Anderson, Froster, and Cox, who has jumped from an airplane 1,098 times. It was planned that would jump into the Lolo area if necessary to directly assist in the rescue of the crashed plane. However, due to poor visibility today, there were also no results. The initial report about the personnel and passengers on the CNAC plane exchanging fire with the Lolo people came from a letter from Wu Guojian, the head of a township in Puge (180 li southeast of Xichang). He Guoguang, the Xichang garrison commander, has dispatched 17 personnel, including family members of the passengers, a Catholic priest, and doctors, but the Lolo people have only allowed two people to enter, one Lolo person and one person dispatched by Mr. He. According to a telegram from He in Xichang: "The crashed plane landed in Abulu Lu Lu Bu village. The Lolo people in the vicinity are even willing to do their best to protect the victims. Please notify the passengers' families to send clothes, food, and medical supplies." The Lolo people may want to use this as a price for releasing the people. The Lolo people are not on good terms with each other. Even with a Lolo person accompanying them, the rescue personnel cannot guarantee that they will be able to pass through all the Lolo areas to reach their destination.

### Hao Yongde, the Culprit of the Wanpaoshan Incident 20 Years Ago, Captured; Changchun War Criminal Investigation Committee Begins Investigation

[Report from Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 5th] Hao Yongde (Hao Yanshi), the culprit of the Wanpaoshan Incident, which shocked the world in the 20th year of the Republic, has been arrested by the Changchun authorities and is currently being investigated by the Changchun War Criminal Investigation Committee. The Wanpaoshan Incident was the prelude to the September 18th Incident. At that time, in order to prevent the joint resistance of the Chinese and Korean nations when creating the incident, the Japanese first instigated Korean farmers in the Wanpaoshan area in July to dig a river to divert water and destroy tens of thousands of mu of Chinese farmland. The local Chinese farmers rose up in opposition and clashed with the Japanese police, resulting in many deaths and injuries. The Japanese further spread propaganda to the Koreans, reversing right and wrong, and falsely accusing China of oppressing Korean farmers. Koreans in Seoul, Incheon, Pyongyang, and other places, not knowing the truth, rioted, destroyed shops of overseas Chinese, and massacred overseas Chinese in various places. Hao Yongde and others took bribes and acted in concert with the Koreans, acting as accomplices.

Editorial

### The Legendary Three-Headed Meeting

Former U.S. Secretary of Commerce Henry Wallace delivered a speech advocating for a change in the U.S.'s tough foreign policy towards the Soviet Union; Stalin told reporters that he believed the world was not on the brink of war; former British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden delivered a speech advocating for reconciliation with the Soviet Union in a new spirit and with new approaches, and Stalin welcomed it the next day; U.S. Secretary of State James Byrnes gave a speech in Paris advocating for a 40-year treaty with Germany; Molotov suddenly returned home on the 4th of this month for instructions: With this series of events, the talk of a meeting between the three major powers of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union is rampant. Judging from these developments, it seems that both the Soviet Union and the Anglo-American countries are working hard to improve the current confrontational situation. This is a welcome phenomenon in the international situation, and from China's standpoint, it is even more in line with our expectations.

The world cannot have a third world war now. This is not only the demand of the people of the whole world, but also a limitation of objective reality. The most important countries in the so-called Third World War are of course the United States and the Soviet Union. However, although the United States is rich and powerful, domestic prices are rising, controls cannot be abolished, and labor strikes are frequent, which seems to indicate domestic unrest. Those in power certainly do not want war, and even if they do, it is not easy to overcome the anti-war sentiment of the American people at this time. One only needs to look at General Eisenhower's recent speech, quoting Lincoln's words that "bullets cannot solve problems," to get a glimpse of the general opinion of the American people. As for the Soviet Union, regardless of whether the atomic bomb has been invented or whether the people have the right to oppose war, the domestic economy is tight, and neither heavy industry nor agriculture has recovered. Only with the implementation of the new five-year plan can it be hoped that in four years, they will be able to make one pair of shoes and three pairs of socks per year for each person. Currently, each person only has one pair of socks per year, and one pair of shoes every other year. There is only one single-track railway line from Moscow to Leningrad. The problems of collective farms are rampant, and have recently been published in newspapers. Under such national strength, no matter what, the authorities may not immediately have the ambition to conquer the world. Marshal Stalin's current talk of not wanting war, we deeply believe, is from the heart.

The United States and the Soviet Union are in fact unable to fight, yet they are recklessly preparing for war, which is the most contradictory phenomenon. Because of the huge military budget, the United States cannot fully improve domestic livelihood issues; the Soviet Union does not build urgently needed machines for postwar transportation and agriculture in most of its factories, but builds tanks, artillery, rockets, and aircraft, and is doing its utmost to research the manufacturing methods of the atomic bomb. The bread rationing system is not dared to be abolished in order to preserve military supplies for unforeseen circumstances. Although the United States and the Soviet Union are not officially at war, this quasi-war situation has already plunged the livelihoods of their own people into pain.

The creation of this worrying situation should not only be attributed to the psychological fear of each other, but also to the fact that there are indeed several important disputes between countries that cannot be resolved, which is also a major reason. The first is the German question, the second is the Danube opening issue, the third is the Trieste issue, the fourth is the Dardanelles issue, the fifth is the Greek civil war issue, and the sixth is the Korean unification issue. These issues, directly and indirectly, prevent the United States and the Soviet Union from trusting each other and cooperating. The Four Foreign Ministers Conference could not resolve them, and the 21-nation Paris Peace Conference could not resolve them either. Unless the highest authorities of the United States and the Soviet Union reach an understanding and come up with practical issues for appropriate resolution, coupled with Attlee's mediation, all international conferences and negotiations seem unlikely to produce completely satisfactory results. Although President Truman does not believe that a meeting between the three major powers of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union can become a reality in the short term, it is probably the most urgent need today. Because only if the heads of state of Truman and Stalin openly propose practical problems and solve them appropriately, with Attlee's mediation in between, can there be a real hope of resolution.

There are some people in the world now who believe that communist countries cannot coexist with capitalist countries in the same world, and that they must either go to war or at least prepare for war. But we believe this is a prejudice and a misconception. Most of the so-called capitalist countries are already democratic countries, and the people have the opportunity to express their opinions freely. Although a few capitalist groups have considerable power to manipulate politics, they cannot completely manipulate it. Once it violates the welfare of the majority of the people, they will inevitably step down. The former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, as a hero of national salvation, was finally defeated in the election, which is a clear example. Although many capitalists are unwilling, the continued control of prices in the United States is finally maintained. The seamen's strike also achieved considerable victory. Moreover, from the standpoint of capitalists, except for a very few arms dealers, they also need peace. Only with peace can they have business to do. We guess that the most important motive for Wallace's opposition to Byrnes's policy may be because he is the Secretary of Commerce, and he believes that as long as Byrnes's policy towards the Soviet Union exists, there may be no way to develop US-Soviet trade.

As for communist countries, most of them are economically poorer than capitalist countries, and after the devastation of war, they need peace even more to restore production. Moreover, communism itself is not without flexibility. The current Soviet society is not the ideal Soviet society of the original Bolsheviks. Many theories that violate human nature and cannot be implemented at all have long been gradually changed to accommodate reality. As for the attempt at world revolution, although they have not theoretically abandoned it and may still be dreaming of realizing it, it must be said without hesitation that they have indeed abandoned it many times in fact. As long as the revolutionary opportunity is not ripe and the objective environment does not allow it, reckless and forceful actions will only accelerate the failure of the revolution and its own collapse. The fourteen leaders of the Kremlin are all extremely shrewd people, how can they not know this? Although they seem determined not to give in on the surface, they must in fact have many considerations. Under the right conditions, they may not be willing to embark on a path of temporary compromise.

From the perspective of the current international situation, a meeting of the three major powers is "possible" to break the deadlock, and this deadlock "must" be broken, because all parties have an urgent need. We hope that Stalin, Truman, and Attlee will see clearly the current urgent need, use a frank attitude, and take practical steps to stabilize this turbulent world.

### What Exactly Does the Chinese Communist Party Want?

Recently, the negotiations on the CCP issue have been deadlocked over the dispute between "three" and "five," and the situation has fallen into extreme depression. After Chairman Chiang returned to Nanjing, the government stated that the five-person conference and the three-person team could be convened at the same time, and the capital had an optimistic atmosphere. Unexpectedly, at this time, the CCP suddenly put forward a memorandum requesting the government to immediately stop all military actions against Zhangjiakou, otherwise it would declare a complete breakdown. Fortunately, the government quickly issued a solemn statement putting forward two concrete suggestions and a final limit of concession for resolving the current situation. As long as the CCP participates in the negotiations and reaches an agreement, a comprehensive ceasefire can be achieved, not just a corner of Zhangjiakou. However, the CCP has not yet given a formal reply.

Although the CCP has not officially replied, the Yan'an Radio Station made an informal statement on the CCP's attitude the day before yesterday, and even further demanded that the National Army withdraw from the areas recovered after January 13 of this year, otherwise the CCP will not participate in the negotiations on the reorganization of the government and will fight to the end. From this, it can be seen that the CCP completely lacks sincerity in peaceful negotiations. Its purpose is not only to stop the war in Zhangjiakou, but also to use its refusal to participate in the negotiations on government reorganization as a means to coerce the government. The CCP's reply is really "irrelevant" and "beside the point," and what it really wants is already obvious. To put it bluntly, the CCP clearly wants to use this coercive method to break the negotiations, make peace hopeless, and plunge China into a state of division.

Looking back on the peace negotiations over the past ten months, talking and fighting, fighting and talking, it is like the weather in the plum rain season, sunny and rainy, rainy and sunny; it is also like suffering from a fever and chills, cold for a while, then hot for a while, then hot for a while, then cold for a while. Standing on an objective position and studying the crux of the current situation, we can see that the price of peace is completely controlled by the CCP. It can turn clouds into rain and do whatever it wants. It will negotiate when it wants to negotiate, and fight when it wants to fight; it will fight when it is advantageous, and negotiate when it is not advantageous; it will fight where it is advantageous, and negotiate where it is not advantageous. And its only reliable tool is to take advantage of the fact that the government and the people both seek peace and are willing to compromise in order to achieve it. Because the government has always adopted a policy of appeasement, the CCP's arrogance has become so rampant. The CCP is superstitious that force is omnipotent. Although the recent counterattack by the National Army has shattered its illusions, it has not yet awakened. The CCP believes that if it wins the war, it can seize the entire central government; if it loses the war, it can split China and become a warlord. It has long inherited the ancient Chinese tradition of "success makes one a king, failure makes one a bandit," believing that it can advance and retreat with ease. But here, we must remind the CCP of one thing: the story of Shi Jingtang is to be despised by all generations.

### Northern Jiangsu Recovered Areas Gradually Recovering; Dikes Breached Have Been Reconnected, Three Banks Allocate Loans

[Our newspaper Xuzhou 4th dispatch] When the communist troops retreated from Huaiyin on September 19th, they breached the Grand Canal dikes in four places. The water rushed south, flooding over two hundred miles of land all the way to Gaoyou. The losses to the people were incalculable. After the National Army moved in, they rushed to block the breaches day and night and the reconnection was completed the day before yesterday.

[Our newspaper Xuzhou 4th dispatch] The Ministry of Finance, due to the communist troops in the recovered areas having arbitrarily issued various counterfeit banknotes, has prohibited their circulation, resulting in a local financial shortage. In the Northern Jiangsu area, it has approved the allocation of 500 million yuan by the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank of China to be lent out by the Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank.

[Our newspaper Xuzhou 5th dispatch] Postal services in the recovered areas of Northern Jiangsu are actively seeking to recover. The postmasters of Huaiyin Post Office, Zhang Wenzhi; Huaian, Liu Deyu; Bao Ying, Cha Songnian; and Gaoyou, Song Tianmin, departed from Xuzhou on the 5th to take up their posts and prepare for the restoration of postal services. Furthermore, postal services between Jinxiang and Xuzhou were restored on the 27th of last month.

[Our newspaper Xuzhou 5th dispatch] The Tongshan Telecommunications Bureau is actively restoring telecommunications in the recovered areas of Northern Jiangsu. The leader of the 3rd Telecommunications Communications Team, Yao Daoxin, departed from Xuzhou on the 1st to prepare in Suqian. It is now known that telecommunications between Xuzhou and Suqian were opened on the 2nd, and telecommunications between Xuzhou and Huai'an can also be reported by the 4th.

[Our newspaper Xuzhou 4th dispatch] The Huaiyin market has not fully recovered. Prices are slightly higher than at the time of the recovery. Pork, which originally sold for only 300 yuan per catty, now sells for 800 yuan. The abolition of Anti-Japanese currency has caused considerable losses to the people, but there are no complaints. Small denominations of legal tender are lacking, and copper coins, etc., are used instead, with a small copper coin worth five yuan. Disputes such as land issues and marriage issues are not as numerous as imagined. The land still belongs to the owners, and the tenant farmers continue to cultivate it. The political department of the garrison has written large slogans on the streets: "Respect the customs and habits of the cities." Everything is quickly returning to normal. The field tax was explicitly suspended last year. Whether the field tax will be levied this year, the county government has not yet received orders. If it is levied, the people will have nothing to pay. The communist troops have taken away a large amount of supplies. If it is not levied, the county government will have no source of revenue. Since entering the territory, the county government has had to raise its own funds. The work is busy, and everything is lacking. However, under all kinds of difficult circumstances, this ancient city, which has been occupied by the Communist Party for a year, is gradually showing new vitality.

[Our newspaper Xuzhou 5th dispatch] After the war, epidemics are prevalent. In the newly recovered areas of Suqian, Siyang, Huaiyin, and Huai'an, there are several cases of cholera and other diseases every day. Medical supplies are lacking, and relief and rescue have not yet begun.

### Exposing the True Face of the Communist Party: "Border Region Chairman" Li Yimang Enjoys Luxury to the Fullest; Soong Ching-ling's Futile Deception by the "Peace Hospital"

[Our newspaper Xuzhou 4th dispatch] After the recovery of Huaiyin, the true face of the liberated area has been exposed, that is, good people cannot live under the rule of the Communist Party. Its various struggle organizations have plundered the wealth of the people. Only Communist Party members can enjoy it. The mansion of Li Yimang, chairman of the Anhui Border Region Government, is extremely luxurious. When he retreated, he took away more than a dozen boxes of valuables.

On September 25th, the local Baozhang, Hu Maojia, discovered this and reported it to the police station, who summoned Chen for investigation.

### Nantong News - Half of the People on the Streets Are Refugees... The Harshness and Cruelty of the Communist Area Is Unbearable to Hear

[Nantong News] I stayed in Nantong for a week this time, and the impression I got was terrible. In my memory, Nantong was a prosperous, lively, and modern city. After arriving in Shanghai, I wanted to go back to Nantong for a visit. After the victory, it was the first place in northern Jiangsu to be recovered, and everything should have been revived. Who would have thought that the neatness and grandeur of the Zhang Jian era have now become disorganized and decadent. The reputation of a model county has become a thing of the past. If Zhang Zhuangyuan were alive, how sad he would be to learn of all this. Everyone on the streets and alleys has a worried expression. If you ask them why, their answer is that it is too much to put into words.

The suspicious surrounding conversations are not entirely in the Nantong dialect, but mostly in the accents of other counties. After the victory, the harsh policies of the Communist area have caused the population here to increase sharply, with the number of outsiders almost equal to the number of locals. Therefore, most of the people I met were from my county. They did not come because of the name or for sightseeing; they were forced to flee. The cost of living in Nantong is not necessarily low, and oil, salt, firewood, and rice are not necessarily cheap, but they feel that this is a land of peace and happiness where they can breathe freely and speak casually without restraint. It is much better than a place where you can't even get a sip of thin congee, have no thatched hut to live in, and your thoughts are controlled and your actions are monitored. Their only request is to be able to survive, but even this most basic requirement cannot be met in their area. What crime have these ordinary people committed?

Land Distribution - One Mu and Three Fen Per Person

According to someone who came from dozens of miles away from Tongzhou, the result of land distribution in the Communist area is that each person only received one mu and three fen of land. Including the homestead, some families with large homesteads only received a homestead. How can you plant on a homestead, how can you produce, and how can you live? People like this can only wait to starve to death. In reality, if calculated on a township basis, each person should receive more than two mu, but only one mu and three fen of land were distributed to each person. Where did the rest go, and what is it being kept for? Ordinary people cannot ask these questions. If you ask, the authorities will suspect you and may even face mortal danger. The Communist army's solution to people's livelihood is to solve the livelihood of a few people (it can be said that it is the livelihood of extremely few people). The Communist army's equal distribution of land is to distribute the land equally to themselves. The intention is only to allow a few people to survive, to allow the people who join the work to survive, and to allow the people who believe in the Communist Party to survive. In the end, even the people who join the work cannot survive and will be squeezed out. Only the people who believe in the Communist Party can survive. The result is to turn the world red and impose a one-party dictatorship.

Terror - Killing at Will

Under the dictatorial and terroristic policies, the people in the so-called liberated areas have no choice but to leave their homes and flee. The local authorities must not know that people have escaped. If they find out, they will be regarded as "wavering elements," a very serious charge. Therefore, people who come out escape secretly without saying a word. Sometimes, even their family members do not know where they have fled to. There are only three types of people who escape: people with prestige, people with assets, and people with knowledge. These three types of people are thorns in the side of the Communist army, and they will not hesitate to use any vicious means to remove them. People with prestige are called "stubborn factions" who are cunning and treacherous if they are not used by the Communist army. People with assets are considered "enjoyers of life" who do not think about production. People with knowledge are called "obstructors of work" if they do not believe in the Communist army's propositions. The most ridiculous thing is that even people who have always been indifferent to the world and taciturn are given an inexplicable title of "suspicious elements." In short, people who are neutral, people who do not associate with them, and people who do not join the Communist army's front are all regarded as uncivilized people and are not allowed to exist. When absolutely necessary, if the above three types of people show a little bit of expression, they will be killed with a trumped-up charge. In a certain township, there was an old township head who had served as township head when the New Fourth Army first arrived in northern Jiangsu. At that time, he was praised as a capable township head. A few dozen days ago, he talked a little about the situation of the National Army in a store. A militia captain found out and took him to a wilderness area and executed him in the name of "reactionary." Even Qin Shihuang's burning of books and burying of scholars was not so cruel. How should the freedom of speech and personal guarantees touted by the Communist Party's newspapers day and night be explained? Are there regional restrictions and do they not apply to the so-called liberated areas of the Communist Party?

Hope - The National Army Arrives

None of the people who have fled to Nantong do not hope that the National Army will arrive soon. Sometimes, although they feel that the government's administration is not entirely satisfactory and that the discipline of the National Army is inevitably disappointing, they believe that this phenomenon is temporary and accidental. From comparison, they deeply feel that the government's administration is much better than the Communist army's tyranny. Their criticism of the Communist army is that they are like beasts and inhumane. Their understanding of the Communist army is that they use clever words to deceive and high-pressure tactics of terror. They do not understand democratic rhetoric. They distinguish right from wrong and who can be approached and who cannot be approached from their practical experience. Their only hope now is that a large number of National Army troops will arrive as soon as possible and thoroughly eliminate the Communist army. As long as they can go home one day, even a sip of weak congee and a thatched hut will be enough. (Seen)

### British Cabinet Creates Ministry of Defence - Unifies Jurisdiction over Army, Navy and Air Force - Alexander Appointed Minister, Cabinet Reduced to Thirteen Members

[Reuters, London, 4th] The British government issued a public statement today announcing the creation of a Ministry of Defence to coordinate the work of the Army, Navy, and Air Force in England. The public statement, entitled "Central Organisation for Defence," announced several changes to the British defence structure, but also stated that this reform is a natural development of the past forty years of policy. The Prime Minister remains the principal person responsible for defence, and will serve as chairman of the Defence Committee. The Minister of Defence, Lord President of the Council, Foreign Secretary, Chancellor of the Exchequer, the three service ministers, Minister of Labour, and Minister of Supply will all be ex-officio members of the committee. The creation of the Ministry of Defence is intended to reduce the cabinet from twenty to eighteen members, and to lower the status of the three service ministers. However, while they will no longer be in the Cabinet, they will remain ministers. The Minister of Defence will be responsible for allocating available resources to the Army, Navy, and Air Force in accordance with the general policies set by the Defence Committee, and for establishing general policies regarding military research and development. The Minister of Defence will also be responsible for general administrative issues. The three service departments will establish common policies on general administration. The ministers of the three services have resigned, which has been approved by the government. These are Secretary of State for War Lawson, Secretary of State for Air Lord Stansgate, and Minister of Civil Aviation Lord Winster.

[Reuters, London, 4th] Alexander was appointed British Minister of Defence tonight. Mr. Alexander has been First Lord of the Admiralty since 1940, and will now have jurisdiction over the Army, Navy, and Air Force. However, since the Ministry of Defence has not yet been fully organised, Mr. Alexander will temporarily be Minister without Portfolio.

The British cabinet has been reorganised as a result of the establishment of the Ministry of Defence. Former Colonial Secretary Hall succeeds Alexander as First Lord of the Admiralty, former Secretary of State for Defence Noel-Baker succeeds Lord Stansgate as Secretary of State for Air, former Under-Secretary of State for War Bellenger succeeds Lawson as Secretary of State for War, and Lord Nathan succeeds Winster as Minister of Civil Aviation. Lord Winster has been appointed Commander-in-Chief of Cyprus tonight. Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies Creech Jones has been promoted to Colonial Secretary. Foreign Secretary Bevin's deputy, McNeil, has been promoted to Minister of State. Although Lord Stansgate will leave the government, he will temporarily remain Bevin's representative in the Anglo-Egyptian treaty negotiations.

### Recruiting Young Talent

[Agence France-Presse, London, 5th]. Political observers here say that there are two motives for this British cabinet reshuffle: one is to form an independent Ministry of Defence, and the other is to recruit younger people into the cabinet. The establishment of the Ministry of Defence is the result of recent meetings between British Chief of Staff Marshal Montgomery and US Chief of Staff Marshal Eisenhower. Recent meetings have also decided to maintain the Anglo-American-Canadian Joint Chiefs of Staff. Regarding the recruitment of younger talents, the promotion of McNeil (the former Undersecretary for Foreign Affairs, newly appointed Minister of State) is one example. Foreign Secretary Bevin values him greatly and almost regards him as his successor. At the same time, many of the newly appointed undersecretaries are young talents.

The British cabinet's implementation of this reorganisation is the result of Marshal Montgomery, the British Chief of the Imperial General Staff, going to the United States for consultations not long ago. (Picture shown) Marshal Montgomery (right) visits the United States and meets with President Truman (left). The photo was taken at the White House. (US News Bureau)

The date of the meeting is likely to be at the end of November of this year, in order to create a more harmonious atmosphere for the next UN General Assembly.

### US and Soviet Representatives at the Peace Conference Appeal for World Peace - All Committees Have Finished Their Work

[Our Report] Paris, 5th, Broadcast: All committees of the peace conference have finished their work and are preparing to submit the draft peace treaties to the general assembly for final decision.

[Our Report] Paris, 5th, Broadcast: Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Vyshinsky and US Representative Connally both expressed their desire to maintain world peace today. Vyshinsky said that the Soviet Union fully supports Stalin's recent speech on world peace. Although the views of various countries are not consistent, we advocate world cooperation. Connally also loudly appealed at the meeting of the Italian Political Committee, saying, "We must not have another war. Some people think that war may be possible now, but I do not believe that humanity has lost its senses to the point of making people shed blood again."

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 4th] The Secretary-General of the Peace Conference, Mr. Dubail, recently met with the chairmen of various committees to discuss how to accelerate the work of the committees, especially the work of the Economic Committee on Italy, which is far from its planned schedule.

### Italy's Compensation Amount Decided

### UK Holds United Nations Week - Ambassador Cheng Delivers Broadcast Speech

[British Information Services, London, 5th] Chinese Ambassador to the UK Dr. Cheng Tianxi delivered a broadcast speech for United Nations Week on the British Broadcasting Corporation today, calling on all countries in the world to unite for peace. Dr. Cheng said that the Chinese are known throughout the world for their peace-loving nature. Ancient Chinese philosophers taught the principles of kindness and justice and cultivated them as the foundation of peace. Dr. Cheng continued, "Our international relations are based on these principles, so that all countries in the world can sincerely cooperate to achieve the goal of peace and the happy life of mankind. In the Second World War, China resisted for more than eight years and suffered the most and sacrificed the most. Therefore, we desire to maintain peace and do everything we can to make the United Nations successful. The principles of the United Nations are in line with the legacy of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the founder of the Republic of China. President Chiang Kai-shek continued the legacy of Premier Sun and, as the leader of the Chinese people, joined forces with the United Nations to resist tyranny in order to establish a truly great republican country. Now that the war is over, the task of guaranteeing world peace falls on the shoulders of the United Nations, but its organization is still in its infancy. Unless we explain its purpose and its huge responsibilities to the people of the world and make them cooperate, it will not be easy to achieve the goal. This is what United Nations Week is for. I am very honored to have the opportunity to explain China's heartfelt support for this United Nations Week and our gratitude to all participating countries."

### Churchill Delivers Speech, Urges National Unity to Resist Communism, Will Not Relinquish Duty While Breath Remains

[Our Own Dispatch] London, 5th (Broadcast): Churchill, in a speech at the Conservative Party National Convention on Saturday, contrasted the shrinking British Empire with the expanding Soviet Union. He pleaded that the severity of the situation prevented him from retiring from public life. He also criticized the Labor government's "vacillation and lack of planning" regarding the Palestine issue. He stated that misfortune and bloodshed might occur in India, which would be lost, and Burma would soon face the same fate. Churchill added that the total number of subjects of the British Empire had gradually decreased to less than one-quarter of its former size, while the people under Soviet autocratic rule were increasing daily. Churchill continued, "I have long considered retirement, but the general situation is so serious that I cannot relinquish my duty. As long as I have breath, I will continue to fight and serve the country."

[Reuters, Black Sea, 5th] Churchill spoke at the Conservative Party Convention here today, stating, in brief, that we, like a large number of neighboring countries, do not wish to have a fundamental discussion of the Party's constitution. The government and its opposition parties—the Socialist Party, the Conservative Party, and the Liberal Party—are now united in resisting communism and the Communist Party. The Socialist Party's declared opposition to communism, while not significant domestically, has generated considerable influence abroad. There is substantial agreement among the parties on the main principles of foreign policy. Close cooperation between Britain and the United States is particularly genuine, and America's firm and unwavering policy in Europe and its abandonment of isolationism are the main bulwarks for safeguarding peace.

### US to Assist Jewish Homeland, Truman Issues New Statement on Palestine, Bluntly Rejects Placing Jewish and Arab Areas Under British Rule

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 4th] President Truman has sent a letter to British Prime Minister Attlee, stating that the Palestine issue must be resolved immediately and need not wait for the Palestine Round Table Conference to reconvene on December 16. The US government is willing to provide all necessary assistance to send exiled Jews to Palestine. This matter must be resolved this winter. I have always advocated transferring 100,000 Jews to Palestine, and this should begin immediately, even before a complete resolution of the Palestine issue is reached. I am willing to submit a plan to Congress for economic aid to Palestine. Furthermore, I also support the Zionist movement's plan to establish a Jewish state in Palestine.

[Associated Press, Washington, 4th] President Truman's statement has created a clear divergence in the positions of Britain and the United States on the Palestine issue. The differences of opinion with Britain include the following points: First, Britain insists that it is unwilling to allow a large number of Jews to immigrate to Palestine without some form of agreement from the Arabs, to avoid inciting incidents. Truman completely rejects this. Second, Britain insists that Palestine be divided into Jewish and Arab areas under British rule, which Truman bluntly refuses, stating that all major American political parties oppose this plan. Third, Truman strongly supports the partition plan for Palestine proposed by the Jewish Agency and has suggested its adoption to British Prime Minister Attlee. Britain has apparently made no progress on this. The substance of the Jewish Agency's proposal is to allow the Jews to establish an independent state in a considerable area of Palestine, and Britain should immediately issue passports to allow 100,000 Jews to immigrate to Palestine. According to President Truman, he does not believe that the plan to divide Palestine into Jewish and Arab areas differs greatly from the Jewish Agency's proposal. The US government is willing to offer assistance in resolving the issue.

### Britain Expresses Regret, Reactions from All Sides

[Reuters, London, 4th] President Truman's appeal to Britain, published today, calling for a large number of Jewish immigrants to be allowed into Palestine before the entire Palestine issue is resolved, has prompted the British Foreign Office to state tonight: British authorities express regret over this. The President's appeal may harm the complicated negotiations currently underway. The President's decision to announce this document today contradicts the wishes expressed by British Prime Minister Attlee. Last night, the US Chargé d'Affaires in Britain, Mr. Gallman, called on the Prime Minister and presented him with the President's statement. The Prime Minister requested that its publication be delayed until he could discuss it with Foreign Secretary Bevin, who is currently in Paris and unable to address the matter. Unexpectedly, the President did not heed this request and proceeded with the announcement. Even the Jewish community in London does not warmly welcome this document. One experienced Jewish observer said that the publication of this document is intended to attract votes in the November congressional elections, and the Democratic Party may increase its vote share as a result, but it will not change British policy.

### Arabs Also Express Opposition

[Associated Press, London, 4th] According to an Arab politician, if President Truman wants to implement his proposal to allow Jews to immigrate to Palestine "immediately in large numbers," it will undermine peace. Syrian Member of Parliament Kouri also stated that Britain has promised that no Jews will be allowed to enter Palestine during the recess of the Palestine Round Table Conference. All Arabs will oppose Truman's statement with all their might. If Truman wants the Arabs to accept his proposal, he will have to send 500,000 US troops to enforce it, which I believe Mr. Truman has not considered. Prime Minister Attlee himself has not yet issued a statement. When Truman's telegram arrived in London, Jewish leaders here were attending a service in the synagogue. Officials at the Colonial Office and the Foreign Office stated that Truman's statement is significant and should be submitted to the Cabinet for discussion, and it is not appropriate to comment lightly at this time.

### British Memorandum Submitted to Turkey, Explaining Views on the Straits Issue, US Considering Whether to Take New Action

[Reuters, London, 5th] A British Foreign Office spokesman stated this morning that the British Ambassador to Turkey, Sir David Kelly, yesterday submitted a memorandum to the Turkish government explaining Britain's views on the Soviet note to Ankara proposing amendments to the current status of the Black Sea Straits. While the official did not disclose the contents of the memorandum, he denied reports that Britain was urging the Turkish government to resolutely reject the recent Soviet proposals. Well-informed sources here believe that the memorandum contains the following key points: (1) Britain does not agree with the Soviet proposal that the Dardanelles Straits should be controlled by countries bordering the Black Sea and jointly defended by the Soviet Union and Turkey. (2) While Britain agrees to revise the Montreux Convention of 1936 governing the status of the Dardanelles Straits, it believes that this should be accomplished through an international conference. (3) Britain is willing for any relevant parties to hold direct discussions before such a conference is convened, but believes that actual negotiations should be conducted by the conference.

[Associated Press, Washington, 4th] Acting Secretary of State Acheson announced today that the United States is actively considering whether to take new action regarding the Soviet demand to jointly manage the Dardanelles Straits with Turkey. The State Department will submit various decisions to President Truman for instructions, allowing the President to decide whether to send notes to the Soviet Union and Turkey.

### Turkey Denies Alliance with Syria

[Reuters, Ankara, 4th] The Turkish News Agency was instructed to deny reports in certain foreign newspapers and radio stations that the Turkish government will negotiate a military alliance or mutual assistance agreement with the Syrian government.

### Soviet Troops to Permanently Station in Korea

[Central News Agency, Washington, 3rd Special Dispatch] According to a report by Reynolds, the Washington correspondent for the Chicago Sun, the Soviet Union has decided to permanently station troops in northern Korea, or to remain until Korea can establish a communist puppet government that is completely favorable to the Soviet Union.

### The Hand of the Führer's Devil, Bormann Arrested

Munich Authorities Deny This Claim

[Our Dispatch] Paris, 5th (Emergency Broadcast from Munich): Qualified authorities have just announced that the rumor that Hitler's assistant, Bormann, was arrested in Munich today is pure fabrication.

[Our Dispatch] Paris, 5th (Broadcast from Nuremberg): Dr. Steer, the Nuremberg German Police Chief, has informed Schacht and Fritsche that they have been granted freedom and can go anywhere, but only within the Nuremberg city limits.

[Reuters, Berlin, 4th] Authorities in the British and French occupation zones of Germany have refused to allow Schacht and Fritsche to enter their zones, and the French occupation zone does not allow Papen to enter. According to US authorities, these individuals will be given the opportunity to choose the location they wish to go to. If they choose the Soviet occupation zone, appropriate authorities will be asked for permission. If the military government provides transportation for departure, a safe conduct pass will be issued to them for travel to the chosen location, and the German police will be notified to provide appropriate protection to prevent mob violence against them. The future handling of Schacht, Fritsche, and Papen under German law will be decided by the German authorities.

### Nehru and Jinnah Meet, Hope for Cooperation Between Congress and League

[United Press, Nuremberg, 5th, According to Dr. Seidl, lawyer for Hess and Frank] Pope Pius XII, through Cardinal Faulhaber of Munich, requested the Allied Control Council in Berlin to pardon Frank, who had been sentenced to death by hanging for his crimes as Governor of Poland.

To date, a total of eleven German war criminals sentenced to death have filed appeals: Göring, Rosenberg, Bormann, Streicher, Frank, Frick, Jaga, Funk, Jodl, and those sentenced to life imprisonment, Hess and Dönitz. All appeals will be reviewed by the Allied Control Council within a week.

### International Monetary Fund's Mission: Stabilize Currency, Prevent Trade Wars; US Treasury Secretary Urges Quick Loan Restorations

[Associated Press, Washington, 4th] The International Monetary Fund (IMF), known as the center of the United Nations' movement to encourage the world to abandon economic weapons, is not as conservative as the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and is considered an innovation in stabilizing national currencies. Gutt, the world-renowned Belgian financier, will be responsible for guiding the work of the IMF. He is quoted as saying that he believes the IMF can stabilize the volatile currencies of various countries, but it will take many years of effort to succeed. The IMF has $8.8 billion in funds, which can prevent countries from resorting to old tricks and creating trade wars like those of the 1930s.

Countries participating in the IMF are, in effect, voluntarily disarming economically, agreeing to cede part of their economic sovereignty to the IMF in exchange for the fund's protection and assistance. The IMF currently has 39 member states, and at least four more are planning to join. The only major country that has not joined is the Soviet Union. The United States has invested $2.75 billion, more than any other country, followed by the United Kingdom with $1.3 billion. The initial task of the IMF is to determine the par value of each country's currency. A portion of the currencies will be fixed within 90 days of the country's initial notification, but countries occupied by enemy countries during the war have the right to request an extension. Once a country's currency is fixed, it must consult with the IMF before making any changes, but changes of up to 10% above or below its value do not require approval from the fund. Member states that do not comply with the resolutions can be expelled. The second step of the IMF's work will begin after the currency ratios of various countries have been determined. Thereafter, the IMF will provide temporary foreign exchange to countries in need of foreign exchange for trade.

[Associated Press, Washington, 4th] The first annual meeting of the Boards of Governors of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund concluded today. Outgoing Chairman Snyder (US Secretary of the Treasury) read a letter from UN Secretary-General Lie, urging that restoration loans be provided to member states as soon as possible, saying that without these loans, production in countries ravaged by war cannot be increased and many years of relief will be required.

### Unprecedented Tragedy in a World of Color, Carnage at the New Guang Theater, Thugs Hurl Hand Grenade, Explosion Fells Twelve on the Spot, Two Seriously Wounded, Lives in Danger

[Our Dispatch] At approximately 8:00 PM last night, during the showing of the musical film "A World of Color" at the New Guang Theater, before the third showing had ended, thugs suddenly hurled a wooden-handled military hand grenade at the ticket booth on the right side. The grenade exploded on the spot, injuring as many as twelve employees, patrons, and passersby, in what is the most unprecedented tragedy in Shanghai since the victory.

The origin of the military hand grenade is peculiar. According to an investigation by reporters at the scene, the thugs who threw the grenade must have stood in front of the stone steps outside the theater and hurled the grenade into the corridor inside the theater. At that time, the patrons who were buying tickets and waiting in front of the ticket booth suddenly heard a "flying grenade." A deafening explosion erupted, and cries of pain filled the air. The order inside the theater was thrown into chaos.

The theater began showing the musical film "A World of Color," starring John Carroll and Susan Hayward, the day before yesterday. Business was booming, and to accommodate the crowds, the number of showings was increased to four per day. Last night, during the third showing at 7:00 PM, as it was dinner time, all but the inspector Li Qinxuan went upstairs to eat. Unexpectedly, at that moment, thugs in front of the stone steps at the entrance hurled a hand grenade at the ticket booth on the right side. The grenade landed next to the stone steps in front of the ticket booth and exploded instantly. In addition to Li Qinxuan being injured on the spot, twelve others were wounded by shrapnel, including Tang Yigao, who sold programs for the theater, and patrons Xie Genrong, Chen Zhilong, Jin Yuquan, Wang Xigui, Mr. Cai, Yue Junkang, and passersby Zhu Fuxing, Yue Shunhua, Yue Jinhua, and Ding Jinhong. The thugs took advantage of the confusion to escape without a trace. After the incident, the theater immediately stopped the showing and urgently called the military, police, and constabulary authorities and the fire department to dispatch ambulances to the scene to rush the injured to Renji Hospital for emergency treatment. Among them, Xie Genrong and Tang Yigao were seriously injured, and their lives are in danger. Director Shi of the Lao Zha Police Station took photographs of the scene as evidence and launched a strict investigation to apprehend the culprits. It was found that the grenade had extremely strong destructive power. In addition to two marble steps being destroyed, almost all of the glass in the doors was shattered, and the ceiling was riddled with shrapnel.

### Pooling Wisdom and Encouraging Each Other: The China General Chamber of Commerce Holds Inaugural Meeting, Elects Directors and Supervisors, and Passes Declaration

Leading figures from Shanghai's commercial, financial, and industrial circles, including Kong Yongzhi, Qian Xinzhi, Du Yuesheng, Xu Jiguang, Bei Zuyi, Jin Runxiang, Fu Rulin, Xi Yushu, Shou Jingwei, Luo Qinghua, and Zhu Huiqing, initiated the organization of the China General Chamber of Commerce. The inaugural meeting was held at the Central Bank Club yesterday at 4 PM.

Assisting the Great Task of National Reconstruction

Chairman Kong Yongzhi delivered the opening address. He stated that during the Anti-Japanese War, while in New York, he attended the Sino-American Industrial and Commercial Advancement Association and discussed Sino-American economic cooperation with key industrialists and businessmen. At that time, he promised to establish a China General Chamber of Commerce to facilitate practical cooperation. After returning to China, he invited comrades to engage in preparations, always mindful of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's industrial plan and the vital importance of realizing the Principle of People's Livelihood. Furthermore, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek regards the inevitable victory of the Anti-Japanese War and the inevitable success of national reconstruction as the common goal of the nation. He hopes that comrades in the industrial and commercial sectors will strive to assist in the great task of ensuring the success of national reconstruction. Subsequently, preparation committee members Fu Rulin and Shou Jingwei reported on the progress of the preparations. City government representative Wu Kaixian and city party headquarters representative Wang Xianqing delivered speeches. Following this, Wu Yunchu and Wang Xiaolai offered congratulatory remarks. After passing the articles of association, directors and supervisors were elected. Kong Yongzhi was elected Chairman of the Board, and Du Yuesheng and Qian Xinzhi were elected Vice-Chairmen. There were twenty-eight directors: Chen Guangfu, Xu Jiguang, Wang Xiaolai, Zhao Dihua, Bei Zuyi, Fu Bo, Shou Jingwei, Wu Yunchu, Luo Qinghua, Song Ziliang, Liu Hongsheng, Xu Guomao, Yang Guanbei, Yu Zuoting, Zhu Huiqing, Tang Xinghai, Rong Hongyuan, Zhou Zuomin, Xu Guangchi, Dai Zhi, Wu Rencang, Wang Zhixing, Li Tongcun, Zhang Yujiu, Ge Jechen, Wang Xianqing, Wang Zulin, and Ge Jingzhong. There were nine alternate directors: Li Wenjie, Li Daonan, Cai Xintang, Tang Jishan, Gu Gengchu, Qu Wenqiao, Liu Jingji, Pan Shihao, and Pan Shijie. There were eleven supervisors: Song Hanzhang, Pan Gongzhan, Li Fusun, Wang Yansong, Lu Jingshi, Fan Zhengbo, Jin Runxiang, Lu Zuofu, Xi Yushu, Lu Cangyan, and Duanmu Kai. There were four alternate supervisors: Lian Yingzhou, Wei Zengfu, Zhang Wenkui, and Zhou Maobai.

Restoring Vitality and Connecting Economies

Finally, the following declaration was passed: "Now that the Second World War has ended for over a year, our nation's various construction projects should be comprehensively planned and actively launched. In particular, the establishment of the most modern type of industry and commerce should be the primary task. The implementation of industrialization in our country is a determined national policy, and post-war commercial policies worldwide will also undergo epoch-making innovations. We, assessing the situation, should catch up quickly and prepare ourselves. This is the natural trend of national economic development at the beginning of national reconstruction, and it is also the natural trend of industrial and commercial advancement. As for how to implement post-war industrial and commercial construction, it is necessary to treat both the symptoms and the root causes, and to consider both domestic and international aspects. Based on the current economic ills, we must prescribe the right medicine. The primary goal is to rescue the unprecedented crisis in the national economic sphere and quickly restore the vitality of industry and commerce. Secondly, we must strive to promote communication between domestic industry and commerce and the overseas Chinese economy. Furthermore, we aim to establish the position of national industry and commerce to engage with international trade and international finance circles, and to lay the foundation for international economic cooperation. In this process, it is especially necessary to gather entrepreneurs, financiers, economists, technicians, and other wise individuals from home and abroad to express their views and discuss sincerely. Issues such as how to balance national defense and the people's livelihood, how to divide labor and cooperate between state-owned enterprises and private enterprises, how to coordinate and utilize free and cooperative economies, how to maintain and develop domestic and foreign trade, and how to comprehensively promote personnel training, scientific management, and financial regulation should all be addressed to rectify current shortcomings and reorganize them. This will enable national capital to coordinate with international capital and utilize it effectively. This is not merely about seeking the restoration of pre-war industry and commerce. Recognizing this, we have specially invited comrades from all relevant parties to initiate the organization of the 'China General Chamber of Commerce' to pool wisdom and encourage each other. We aim to be a design organization for domestic industrial and commercial groups and entrepreneurs, as well as a central hub for connecting overseas Chinese and international economic groups. We hope that domestic and overseas industrial and commercial groups and economic experts will actively participate and provide guidance, so that we can pool wisdom and effort, facilitate trade and benefit industry. This is not only the fortune of our colleagues, but also the fortune of the future of our nation's industry and commerce."

### Celebrating the Chairman's Sixtieth Birthday: Preparatory Meeting in the City to Discuss Celebration Methods

Various groups in the city, in order to celebrate the Chairman's sixtieth birthday, held the first preparatory meeting for celebrating the Chairman's sixtieth birthday at the City Council at 3 PM the day before yesterday. The attendees included Pan Gongzhan from the City Council, Fang Rusheng from the Federation of Labor Unions, Li Zai from the Bankers' Association, Zhu Jiushen from the Old Industry Association, Xu Jiguang from the Chamber of Commerce, Jiang Jizhou and Yu Chuanding from the Education Association, Feng Youzhen from the Journalists' Association, Li Zikuan from the Newspaper Publishers' Association, Pang Jingzhou from the Medical Association, Xu Yongzuo from the Accountants' Association, Wu Zheng from the Lawyers' Association, and Zhu Wende from the Local Association, totaling thirteen people. Those present in an advisory capacity included Mayor Wu Guozhen, Deputy Director Li Jianhua of the Social Affairs Bureau, Director Zhang Xiaosong of the Civil Affairs Department, and Xi Wenzhong, executive member of the City Party Headquarters. Chairman Pan Gongzhan stated: The City Council proposed that the city should hold a celebration for the Chairman's sixtieth birthday this year, and should also establish a permanent memorial to show respect and gratitude. The proposed celebration methods include: (1) donating a school as a birthday gift, (2) building a Zhongzheng Hall, (3) casting a bronze statue, and (4) establishing a scholarship fund. He hoped that everyone would discuss these options together. As a result, it was decided that, in order to express the unanimous desire of the city's people to celebrate enthusiastically, the first organizers would invite hundreds of groups, including business associations, labor unions, religious organizations, hometown associations, student federations, women's associations, and postal service associations, to participate. The second general meeting of organizers was scheduled for 2 PM on the 12th of this month at the Chamber of Commerce. At that meeting, preparatory committee members would be nominated, a committee would be formed, and preliminary discussions on celebration methods would be held. The consensus was to simplify the celebrations, focusing only on donating a school and creating a statue as birthday gifts, both of which could serve as permanent memorials. It was proposed that the birthday celebration hall be located at the Ningbo Hometown Association. The organization of the preparatory committee would be divided into general affairs, finance, design, layout, and storage groups. The above discussion results were proposed to be passed by the second organizers' meeting before a final decision is made.

### If Neon Lights are Used Again from Tomorrow, Electricity Will Be Cut Off: Three Steps Implemented to Increase Power Production

[Reported by our newspaper] Regarding the temporary suspension of the use of neon lights and decorative lights, the Public Utilities Bureau is currently adopting a peaceful guidance approach, hoping that all merchants and residents of the city will understand the difficulties and comply. However, according to Director Zhao Huijue of the Public Utilities Bureau, if anyone continues to disobey after the 7th of this month, electricity will be cut off.

[Another report] According to Director Zhao Zengjue of the Public Utilities Bureau, in order to solve Shanghai's power shortage and increase production to fulfill national policies, the Public Utilities Bureau has designated increasing power supply as one of the central tasks for the coming year. Based on three major steps, it will be actively completed: (1) supervising various power plants to repair machinery damaged during the war, (2) supervising various power plants to add new machinery, and (3) assisting various power plants in applying for loans and purchasing generators. Recently, the Public Utilities Bureau assisted the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company in borrowing 2.4 billion yuan from the Four Banks Joint Office for repairing two damaged Squad machines. However, it will take more than a year to complete the repair of these two machines. Rumors that Zhabei Water and Electricity will be able to generate 30,000 kilowatts this year are not accurate. A new diesel machine purchased by the French Water and Electricity Company, with a capacity of 3,600 kilowatts, will arrive by the end of the year. Another one will arrive in June next year.

Currently, Shanghai's monthly power generation is 141,000 kilowatts. If all work can be implemented according to the planned schedule, power generation will increase by one-third by the end of next year. It is estimated that it will reach 180,000 kilowatts by the end of March, 188,640 kilowatts by the end of June, 192,640 kilowatts by the end of September, and 217,640 kilowatts by the end of December.

On the other hand, the "Shanghai Power Grid Technical Committee," organized by the Public Utilities Bureau together with relevant experts, plans to complete the entire Shanghai power grid in the first half of next year, facilitating the realization of a 33,000 kilowatt ring-shaped power supply. At the same time, it will rationalize, standardize, and unify the generation, transmission, distribution, and use of electricity in all power plants in the city.

### Representatives of the Cosmetics Industry Petition in Nanjing

The Shanghai Cosmetics Industry Association has specially dispatched representatives Hu Boxiang (Director), Lin Rukang (Director), Ma Lingyun, Zhou Feng'ai, and Fu Keming to Nanjing to petition the Legislative Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and other relevant agencies, requesting the authorities to postpone the recently promulgated and implemented cosmetics commodity tax, which levies 45% based on price, in order to save the crisis facing the entire industry. According to the representatives: (1) The current cosmetics industry is small and underdeveloped, with most production being manual. Only a few have simple mechanical equipment, and they are not suitable targets for collecting commodity tax. (2) A large number of imported cosmetics are flooding in, mostly goods that evade taxes, resulting in extremely low costs. Domestically produced cosmetics can hardly compete. If a commodity tax of 45% is added, they will have no place to stand. (3) The term "cosmetics" is too vague. Items such as talcum powder, soap, cologne, skin cream, and face lotion are daily hygiene products used in summer or winter and should not be treated as cosmetics.

### A Group of Polish Nationals Returns Home

[Reported by our newspaper] A group of Polish nationals departed on the Soviet ship Smolny for Vladivostok, then transferred to the Trans-Siberian Railway to return home. Among them were two doctors and five sailors who had been stranded in Shanghai during the war and were detained in concentration camps by the Japanese army. During this long journey, UNRRA not only paid for all their travel expenses but also provided winter clothing, bedding, and food rations. The most right in the column are Mr. Kerber, director of the Displaced Persons Repatriation Group of the UNRRA Shanghai Office, and his assistant, Mr. Kerff. (Photo by The New York Times)

### Bright, Dazzling, Hard: Diamonds Valued Thousands of Times Over, the Best Have "Fifty-Eight Facets," Costing 2.67 Million Yuan per Carat

[Special Feature by Our Newspaper] I am merely a piece of ore. In terms of the chemical elements discovered, I am a form of carbon. To date, relatively few of my kind have been unearthed. Scarcity makes me valuable, so I am regarded as a "treasure." Furthermore, my quality is the hardest, so the Chinese compatriots have given me the honorable title of "Diamond."

The visual impression I give is brightness, purity, honesty, and dazzling radiance. However, unfortunately, some of my famous colleagues have had their tragedies and histories after being discovered and polished by humans. The Habsburg dynasty of Austria, the Russian Tsar, the French royal family of Pitt, the Persian Mongol emperor Immot... which prominent dynasty did not have a close relationship with me! The most famous of my colleagues is currently set in the crown of the British monarch!

Most of my colleagues come from Kimberley in South Africa and Brazil in South America. In just a few hundred years, I have become the only treasure circulating internationally!

Shanghai—an international metropolis—how could it be without me? However, my contact with the people of Shanghai has only been about forty or fifty years. My popularity in the market is only a matter of the last twelve or thirteen years.

Currently, it is difficult to categorize my colleagues circulating in the market. However, in terms of color, we can roughly divide them into five types: white, yellow, red, blue, and black. Comparatively, the white ones with a hint of red are of course the most precious. The people of Shanghai have given them the nickname "kerosene head." Unfortunately, these "kerosene head diamonds" are extremely rare. The ones commonly seen circulating are white without a hint of red, which are commonly referred to as "white diamonds"!

Let me tell you, a well-cut standard diamond has "fifty-eight facets," that is, fifty-eight small faces. Please carefully examine the waist of a diamond, and you can see that it is divided into the crown and the pavilion. The most beautiful small facet on the crown is called the "table." The small faces surrounding it are eight called "stars," four called "bevels," four called "rhomboid faces," eight called "cross faces," and eight called "skill faces." These thirty-three small faces on the surface of a diamond are distributed at different angles, emitting light. Furthermore, the small facets of the pavilion are mostly fewer than those of the crown, with only twenty-five small faces. Their names are: "culet" (opposite the "table" of the crown), four "girdle facets," four "wedge facets," eight "cross faces," and eight "skill faces." It is said that now, with the increasing progress of polishing machines, the best can be cut to sixty-four facets.

The August 13th artillery fire was a major turning point in my life history in Shanghai. Because, from then on, I saw endless banknotes rolling in, and my "value" increased daily. Taking the kerosene head diamond as an example, in 1936 and 1937, it was 1,400 to 1,500 yuan per carat. Now it is 2.67 million yuan! Furthermore, taking the slightly inferior white diamond as an example, the current market price also hovers between 1.6 million and 2 million yuan.

However, the market price of diamonds must also be determined by its weight. For example, taking white diamonds as an example, within fifty points (half a carat), each carat is calculated at a ratio of 700,000 to 800,000 yuan. For those around twenty points, each carat is calculated at a ratio of 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. However, for small diamonds within ten points, the market price is even calculated at a ratio of 700,000 to 800,000 yuan per carat. These are all calculated based on the difficulty of polishing and the breadth of circulation.

Objectively speaking, my "value" has only increased more than 2,000 times in the past nine years, which is considered fair compared to other prices. But to say something bleak, what is circulating and being traded in the market are only diamonds of 0.6 or 0.7 carats to 1.5 carats. To search for a diamond over ten carats, even if you step through all fifty or sixty jewelry stores in the city, the result will still be in vain. It is said that even Shao's collection is only a dozen carats at most. However, one jeweler said: The largest diamonds in Shanghai are about forty carats each, and of course, the number is very small. As for who the collector is, it remains an unbreakable mystery!

However, I must raise the most serious protest to those who only use me as an ornament. Why only treat me as a decorative puppet. I must solemnly declare that I have supreme industrial uses. Look at the precise machinery, the elevators of airplanes, and the shafts of famous watches—which important industrial sector can do without me? For this reason, I want the diamond collectors in the world to give me a new evaluation, so that I can break away from the shackles of exclusive decoration and create more industrial achievements for humanity!

### Financial Circles Implement Austerity, Eliminating Unnecessary Banquets and Receptions: Circular Seeking Opinions Widely from Colleagues

[Reported by our newspaper] Financial leaders in the city, Li Fusun and Qin Runqing, have recently launched an austerity movement in the financial circles. At the same time, Governor Bei Songsun of the Central Bank expressed his great approval. First, Li Ming sent a letter explaining the reasons, listing the names of the initiators, and sending it to colleagues for their opinions in order to draft regulations. Then, they will jointly seek the participation of people in the industry. The original letter from Mr. Li, which our reporter obtained privately, is transcribed below: "Respected Sir: Our country's eight-year war of resistance consumed an enormous amount of manpower and resources. In the future, unless all the people of the country are diligent and thrifty, accumulate resources, and use them for construction, the fruits of victory may be abandoned. Therefore, President Chiang Kai-shek has repeatedly urged the people to implement austerity and improve customs. The austerity movement in this city is also being advocated by Mayor Wu and leaders from all walks of life. I recently discussed this with colleagues in the industry, and we all agreed that Shanghai's extravagant and frivolous customs are now even worse than before. People in the financial industry are outstanding members of the citizens, and they should practice what they preach in the austerity movement to reverse the declining trend. At that time, someone mentioned the frequent banquets and receptions in Shanghai recently. The gentlemen present agreed that most of these banquets and receptions were unnecessary, and that financial figures should first eliminate them in the future. I was instructed to advocate for this. The above proposal is deeply in line with my sentiments. The reasons can be summarized into three points: (1) Unnecessary banquets waste money and time. In today's post-war era, the more we waste, the less construction power the country has. (2) Diligence and frugality are inherent virtues of our country, which are best understood by the conservative financial community. Practicing austerity is in line with the principle of not shirking responsibility. (3) The daily affairs of financial professionals are already busy and complicated. In their spare time, they all want more rest opportunities and more family life time to recover from fatigue easily. All unnecessary social activities directly reduce personal cultivation and indirectly affect the efficiency of governance. During the war of resistance, I traveled far to the United States. The United States is the most affluent country in the world, and its people have the highest standard of living in the world. However, bankers and industrialists in that country do not easily entertain guests. Those who make appointments for meals for business matters usually have simple lunches in order to save time, and they do not invite anyone to accompany them. This situation was not only during the war. Last year, Mr. Zhang Gongquan visited England on official business and informed us of his impressions of England in a letter, saying that after the war, the British were encouraging themselves to be diligent and frugal and were working hard to restore the country. A financial expert invited him to dinner at his home, and he saw that there were no servants in the house and the dishes were simple. The cooking and serving were all done by the hostess. From this point of view, in our poor country, the word "frugality" is more shameful than that of the allies. According to our observation, most people in the financial community have a negative attitude towards unnecessary banquets, but they cannot refuse them altogether. After being invited, they may have to hold banquets in return, so superficially they cannot avoid following the custom, but in reality, everyone has the same thought. For the sake of now, we might as well be honest and avoid redundant practices, jointly declare that all unnecessary banquets should be eliminated, and that gifts for celebrations and so on should also be as frugal as possible. I am sending this special letter to seek your high opinion and to list the names of the initiators below. I respectfully ask for your guidance so that we can formulate regulations and welcome colleagues to participate. I sincerely hope so." Initiators: Bei Songsun, Qin Runqing, Lin Fengbao, Xu Guangchi, Li Daonan, Shen Rixin, Pan Zhonglin, Xiang Shuxiang, Sun Ruihuang, Xu Guomao, Chen Duoru, Ju Yihong, Cao Jiru, Li Zai, and Li Ming.

It is learned that they will be officially sworn in on the 14th, and important personnel matters in the internal departments will be decided within days.

### Forty Traitors from Suzhou Escorted to Shanghai in Shackles; Zhang Beisheng Shamelessly Claims He "Has Not Forgotten the Country"; Petty Traitors Distribute Leaflets on the Platform

[Report from our newspaper] Zhang Beisheng, the traitorous former head of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, Pan Hongqi, the traitorous former magistrate of Jiangdu County, and forty other traitors were escorted yesterday by Chen Songnian, the warden of the Suzhou High Court, guard captains Ye Ruiting and Xiang Jian, clerk Yao Qiwen, and ten court police officers. They traveled from Suzhou on a second/third class train to Shanghai, arriving at the North Station at 1:05 PM. The prisoners, shackled and carrying bags, satchels, and water bottles, disembarked in two rows. Zhang and Pan brought up the rear. Zhang wore a long blue cloth gown and cloth shoes, one heel of which was tattered. As he walked off the platform, he supported his chin with his hand. When reporters approached him, Zhang shamelessly claimed he had not forgotten the country. He was satisfied with the life sentence and would not appeal. Pan wore a coffee-colored gown and a small melon-shaped hat, his beard already white. He said nothing. Some of the petty traitors took out printed materials from their bags titled "A Humble Appeal from 300,000 Helpless Children of the Nation to All Senior Officials," distributing them to the onlookers on the platform. The prisoners were then put onto two waiting buses and taken to Tilanqiao Prison for detention. The complete list of names is as follows: Zhang Beisheng, Pan Hongqi, Shen Zhengxin, Pu Zhaoliang, Gao Zhengang, Ye Jin Erlang, Zhang Jianqiu, Lü Yibiao, Su Xiong, Tang Guilin, Li Suolong, Lu Yisong, Ding Rongxun, Jiang Hong, Ding Yuyi, Kong Lingdu, Liu Gang, Zhou Renbao, Zhu Delin, Dong Jihua, Yang Zhao, Xue Qi, Wu Bingsheng, Wu Zhaoshou, Ji Yangzhang, Luo Zulin, Hu Chunlin, Gao Fuquan, Jiang Juzhen, Zhang Miaogen, Shen Jinkui, Wang Xiyuan, Zhou Caizhang, Pan Menghua, Huo Weishan, Feng Chao, Xie Changgui, Zhi Yangchu, Sui Zhenggao, Qin Haozhong.

[Report from our Suzhou office, 5th] Chen Songnian, warden of the Suzhou Third Prison, and Xiang Jian, clerk of the High Court, led fourteen court police officers, armed with rifles and live ammunition, on the 5th. They escorted forty convicted traitors by truck to the train station, boarded the 71st second/third class train to Shanghai, and departed around 9 AM to be transferred to Tilanqiao Prison in Shanghai for imprisonment. During the escort, Zhang Beisheng and Pan Hongqi were handcuffed together. Zhang's face was no longer as full of sorrow as before; he was even chatting and laughing, seemingly pleased that he had been spared his life. They spoke loudly at the station, boasting about how they had not failed the people while serving in their traitorous positions, truly shameless. The complete list of names and sentences is recorded below: Zhang Beisheng, life imprisonment. Pan Hongqi, 12 years. Wu Zhaoshou, 7 years. Ji Yangzhang and Luo Zulin, both 6 years. Hu Chunlin, Gao Fuquan, Jiang Juzhen, Zhang Miaogen, Shen Jinkui, Wang Xiyuan, Zhou Caizhang, Pan Menghua, Huo Weishan, Feng Chao, Xie Changgui, Zhi Yangchu, Sui Zhenggao, Qin Haozhong, and Shen Zhengxin, all 5 years.

Zhang Jianqiu, Lü Yibiao, Su Xiong, Tang Guilin, Li Suolong, Lu Yisong, Ding Rongxun, Jiang Hongjin, Ding Yuyi, Kong Lingdu, Liu Gang, Zhou Renbao, and Zhu De, all 2 years and 6 months. Dong Jihua, Yang Zhao, Xue Qi, and Wu Bingsheng, all 2 years.

### Sheng Lao San, Who Rose to Prominence Through Drug Trafficking, Was Known as the Richest Man During the Enemy-Puppet Period; The High Court Summons Two Puppet Officials to Investigate Extortion

[Report from our newspaper] Sheng Youyi (aka Sheng Lao San), who was prominent during the enemy-puppet period and rose to prominence through drug trafficking, and was known as the richest man in Jiangnan, was arrested by military authorities and sent to the Capital High Court for trial after the victory. To obtain a detailed understanding of the case, the court entrusted the local High Court to investigate some of the materials. The High Court opened a hearing yesterday to question Cai **, former head of the Yuyao Puppet Salt Bureau, and Li Yimin, both in custody. Cai stated that Sheng's Yuhua Salt Company had branches in Yuyao that purchased salt at low prices and deducted weight. In 1943, they forced salt farmers to sell salt at a price of twelve yuan per dan (unit) using enemy power. Cai argued that according to the central government's past regulation of ten dan of salt being equivalent to one dan of rice, and with rice priced at six hundred yuan per dan at the time, salt should have been priced at sixty yuan per dan. He insisted on this argument and was forced to resign. Li, who served as the head of the Puppet Anti-Smoking Bureau in Changzhou, Kunshan, and other places, stated that Hongji Shanchang was managed by Sheng as general manager. After opium was transported from North China to Shanghai and concentrated there, it was then transported to various opium dens for sale to smokers. After obtaining licenses from Sheng, the opium merchants could sell opium publicly. With the backing of the enemy's power, the Anti-Smoking Bureau and any government agencies were unable to stop them.

### Former Head of the Puppet Shanghai Land Administration Bureau, Fan Yongzeng, Sentenced to Eight Years

[Report from our newspaper] The High Court yesterday announced verdicts in two cases involving suspected traitors: Fan Yongzeng, for colluding with the enemy and plotting to resist this country, was sentenced to eight years of imprisonment and eight years of deprivation of civil rights. All of his property, except for a reasonable amount to cover the necessary living expenses of his family, was confiscated. The presiding judge explained that the defendant had served as the head of the Puppet Shanghai Land Administration Bureau from the beginning of the war of resistance until the victory, a serious offense. However, because he was initially forced to participate, the sentence was set at eight years. If he disagrees, he can appeal to the Supreme Court for review within ten days of receiving the judgment. The defendant repeatedly said, "I will appeal." Fan is a native of Shanghai, currently 57 years old, and studied at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United States, obtaining a master's degree in engineering. After returning to China, he worked as a professor at Jiaotong University and the River and Sea Engineering College. In 1937, he was still working in the Shanghai Land Administration Bureau as a section chief.

### Chen Zujian Sentenced to Five Years

Chen Zujian, for colluding with the enemy to supply raw materials for the manufacture of ammunition, was sentenced to five years of imprisonment and five years of deprivation of civil rights. All of his property, except for a reasonable amount to cover the necessary living expenses of his family, was confiscated.

On the same day, the High Court concluded the cases of Shen Sanlang, an intelligence agent for the enemy's Gendarmerie in Nanhui County, and Wang Qiugen, a translator for the Police Unit in Jiading County, and scheduled the verdicts to be announced on the 12th of this month.

The cases of Sha Kesiji Baoke, Zhang Shuchun, Yuan Jiaye, Chuan Shaofa, Li Chengde, Xie Guangming, Xu Shutian, and others have been rescheduled for further hearings after investigations are completed.

(Another report) The High Procuratorate has filed charges against Wu Yizhi, Xu Xi, Zhu Linsheng, and others for suspected traitorous activities.

### A Thousand Taels of Opium Seized From the Illegally Obtained Assets of Two Major Traitors

The Enemy Property Disposal Bureau is handling the illegally obtained assets of detained traitors of all sizes. Those who have already been convicted are being processed. Principles for handling requests from traitors' families for living expenses have also been drafted and submitted to the Executive Yuan for review. Recently, the bureau discovered a large quantity of opium, totaling about a thousand taels, hidden in the properties of Shao Shijun and Chen Qun. The bureau has decided to transfer the opium to the police for complete destruction.

### Senator Accused, Prosecutor Unaware

[Report from our newspaper] Regarding the accusations against eleven city senators for suspected traitorous activities, this reporter visited Du Baoqi, the chief prosecutor of the Shanghai High Procuratorate. According to him: "I am not aware of this matter. Accusations of treason are handled separately by each prosecutor. Regardless of whether senators are involved, the investigations cannot be made public according to law. Whether this is the case or not will be proven by the facts in the future." Du also solemnly denied having met with a reporter from Da Guang News Agency on the 4th and made statements. He claimed: "My trip to Nanjing was purely personal. Rumors that it was to request instructions from the Ministry of Judicial Administration regarding the accusation of treason against city senators are inaccurate. Prosecutors conduct investigations independently and do not need instructions from the Ministry of Judicial Administration."

### A Spender Is a Swindler; A Goddess Pretends to Be a Lady; Yang Qinghe Jewelry Store Deceived of Gold Bars

[Report from our newspaper] At around 4 PM on the 3rd, two customers, a man and a woman, suddenly arrived at Yang Qinghe Jewelry Store on Nanjing Road, well-dressed **. The man carried a canvas bag, filled**, and placed it on the counter, claiming to buy seven small gold bars and two gold rings. The shop assistant Yu Zhenpeng cordially attended to them. After selecting them, they put them into their pockets and said that they still needed gold bracelets and wanted to choose new styles. When Yu Zhenpeng turned around to get the gold bracelets, the man said to the woman, "Wait a moment, see if the car is outside." Unexpectedly, they left and never returned. Half an hour later, the store opened the canvas bag that was placed on the **. They found a pile of legal tender, but only the outer layer was real, the inside was all ten and five yuan notes, mixed with other paper. They reported it to the Lao Zha District Police Station, which sent officers to bring the woman to the station. She confessed that her name was Zhuang Lifang, 21 years old, from Ningbo, and that she used to be a prostitute. On the evening of the 2nd, she met the man (whose name she did not know) at the Garden Hotel at 453 Zhejiang Road and spent the night with him. He gave her 120,000 yuan. According to her, he said he would exchange it for gold jewelry to give as a gift. Because she saw that he was generous, she did not suspect anything. Who knew that he was a swindler? The police obtained a description of the suspect's face, figure, and clothing and dispatched officers to investigate and arrest him for interrogation.

### Distribution of Sugar to Public and Private School Staff; Payment Deadline Tomorrow, Distribution Begins

[Report from our newspaper] The deadline for payment for the second installment of sugar to be distributed to public and private school staff is today, and distribution will begin tomorrow. The sugar has also been well-received by public and private school staff in general. As of yesterday, 70,000 people had made payments, accounting for about two-thirds of the total. The office also received a letter from the "Executive Yuan Relief Administration," stating that a large number of cosmetics, such as hair oil, hair wax, and face oil, are available for distribution. Because these items are not necessities, it has been decided to use a public purchase method to sell them at several retail outlets in the city. The office is actively preparing for this.

### Wanshou Nunnery; Drug Trafficking Den Cracked; Female Criminal "Wu Zetian" Arrested; Monk and Policeman Suspected and Arrested

[Report from our newspaper] The day before yesterday, Song, the chief of the Taishan Police Station, received a tip that Chen Jiang, a woman from Jiangbei (nicknamed "Wu Zetian"), who lived upstairs at 575 Shunchang Road, had Yuan Ji, the presiding monk of Wanshou Nunnery, as her adopted godfather, and her lover was Chen Jinsheng, a policeman with ID number 4352. She usually relied on the power of her lover to sell morphine and allowed monks Benyi and Liaofan, among others, to smoke drugs in her house. He dispatched Zhang Rou, the director of the judicial section, and Xu Dezhong, among others, to the location. They arrested Chen Jiang, seized 74 packages of morphine, and brought in the drug-addicted monk Benyi, the suspected Yuan Ji, the caretaker monk of Wanshou Nunnery, the customer Ma Jinbiao, and Chen Jiang's lover, Chen Jinsheng, to the police station. Chen Jiang stubbornly denied everything, but her adopted father, the caretaker monk Yuan Ji, testified that Chen Jiang was indeed a morphine dealer. After being proven by her adopted father, she became furious and said that her adopted father also smoked morphine.

### Answering Readers' Questions; Medical Advisor

(1) Red Bumps All Over the Body

Yao Zhongming asks: * I often have red bumps rising on all parts of my body. The shape is sometimes long and sometimes oval, with very thin blisters. They itch terribly. Scratching stops the itching but causes severe pain. Is this caused by flea bites or by eating stimulating foods such as shrimp and crab? Are air-filled injections effective? Are there any other simple treatments? Please advise.

[Answer from Doctor Zhang Zhongming] Your condition is urticaria. You should avoid stimulating foods, take more laxatives to promote bowel movements, and use calcium injections for auxiliary treatment. This will be more effective.

(2) Leg Ulcer

Jiang Hui asks: * My mother has suffered from leg ulcers for more than ten years, and repeated treatments have been ineffective. Sometimes they heal on their own without treatment, but soon they ulcerate again. Recently, the affected area has grown larger, covering almost the entire calf, causing severe pain day and night. Her muscles are wasting away. Because we live in the countryside of Zhuji and are limited by financial resources, we cannot afford hospitalization. Her life is in danger. I don't know if there are any over-the-counter medications that can be purchased. Please advise.

[Answer from Doctor Zhang Zhongming] For chronic ulcers, a blood test must be performed first, and then treatment can be administered accordingly.

(3) Swollen Tongue with Ulceration

Jin Kehong asks: * When I was young, the surface of my tongue suddenly broke with deep lines. Red spots grew in clusters, and the tip of my tongue had barbs, overflowing with fresh blood. It also had a rotting appearance, without pain or itching. This has been happening for more than ten years, sometimes appearing and sometimes disappearing, with no consistency. Now my tongue is swollen and large, different from ordinary people. My sense of taste is not affected, but speaking and reading are very inconvenient. I cannot speak clearly or pronounce words accurately. I have consulted Chinese and Western doctors, but none of the treatments have been effective. Please advise on treatment methods. I would be grateful for your advice in your column.

[Answer from Doctor Zhang Zhongming] Your condition may be chronic glossitis, caused by a lack of vitamin B2. Riboflavin injections are recommended.

### Cotton Yarn Brokers Slack Off; Reason Is Demand for Increased Commission; Yarn Market Briefly Halted, Declining by Two to Three Hundred Thousand; Application for Eight Types of Spinfabrics Distribution Not Enthusiastic

After the yarn market rose with gold yesterday, sales were * and quiet, with few transactions, and a decline of one hundred thousand yuan. At the same time, the * Zhongshe (the brokers' association), the intermediaries in the yarn industry, had a dispute with the yarn industry association over demands for increased commissions. The brokers agreed to temporarily stop soliciting business, so yarn dealers, customers, and practical manufacturers had no transactions due to the lack of intermediaries. It was not until noon that business began to pick up slightly, with prices falling by two to three hundred thousand yuan compared to the previous day. 42-count yarn sold for 3.35 million yuan, and 20-count yarn sold for 2.17 million yuan. It is said that the transactions were between opponents in the industry, and the trend was weak.

In addition, the cotton yarn and cloth market once closed yesterday morning and resumed trading at 11:45 AM. The reasons included not only the brokers' demand for increased commissions, but also the yarn dealers' association's * complaint that Xinguang Underwear Factory and others illegally sold the yarn distributed by Spinfabrics on the black market, with a * profit of 810,000 yuan per bale. Spinfabrics made no clear statement, leading to the market closure. Later, the person in charge of Spinfabrics said: "The distribution of cotton yarn is mainly to processing manufacturers, but Spinfabrics does not want a small number of manufacturers to * ." Therefore, the factories reported are suspended. Other than suspension, there are no other countermeasures. After receiving a notice from the Yarn Dealers Association the other day, reporting that some manufacturers were * selling the distributed yarn, it has already notified those factories on the * list to cancel their distribution rights and has replied to the Yarn Dealers Association. It has been determined to stop distributions later if similar behavior is discovered.

The cloth market also showed little vigor yesterday, with trading becoming more idle and sales stagnating. The transactions were mostly *, and there were sporadic inquiries, so the desire was weak. Spinfabrics * opened for sale eight types of cloth, with 86,000 yuan for Longtou fine cloth. The total amount * was fully distributed. Numbers 1 to 155 and 787 to the end had allocations, totaling 24,000 bolts. Most of the other goods were also allocated, but the number of applicants in this period was not very enthusiastic. The reason is that the * roots have not yet * moved, and the * interest is very high, which is not very cost-effective.

### The Central Bank's Governor Instructs Currency Exchange Businesses Again Yesterday: Strictly Follow the Three Temporary Laws; US Dollar Price Must Not Exceed Telegraphic Transfer Rate by 5%

[Report from Our Newspaper] US dollar trading has virtually disappeared since the Currency Exchange Business Association announced a three-day suspension to all its members some days ago. Yesterday, most currency exchange houses still did not open for US dollar transactions. However, along Sichuan Road and Nanjing Road, there were still many foreign merchants engaging in small-scale US dollar buying and selling. The black market price was around 4,200 yuan, with a difference of about 100 yuan between buying and selling prices. According to unofficial reports, demand still exceeded supply. Generally, the situation has become stable after the authorities established three temporary measures for various transactions.

This reporter then visited Wang Yuncheng, the chairman of the Currency Exchange Business Association, who said: At 10 a.m. yesterday, he was summoned again by Governor Bei of the Central Bank, and met him again. Mr. Lin, a staff member representing the municipal government, was also present. He stated: He hoped that currency exchange businesses would understand the intentions of the authorities and strictly implement the three temporary measures for buying and selling US dollars that were established some days ago. All buying and selling of US dollars can only be conducted according to the Central Bank's legal exchange rate for US dollars, plus 5% as a standard; otherwise, they would be severely punished. If it is discovered that there are large buyers and those who raise prices to purchase US dollars, it should be reported to the municipal government immediately and must not be concealed. The meeting did not end until noon. Mr. Wang then convened a meeting of the association's directors at around 6 p.m. yesterday to discuss the matter together and resolved to inform all members to strictly implement it. He also said: When US dollar trading resumes on Monday, according to the temporary measures, the market price of US dollars should be 3,517.50 yuan, so the estimated buying and selling price should be between 3,500 yuan and 3,520 yuan, but there are fears that there will be a lack of actual transactions. The market situation may be sluggish for one or two weeks. The difficulty currently felt by currency exchange businesses is the issue of new and old US dollar bills, and they are seeking a reasonable solution to it.

### Allotment Work is in Preparation; Artificial Silk Situation Gradually Stabilizing; China Trust Can Allot Eight Times a Month

The artificial silk market, which had fallen back for several days, gradually stabilized yesterday. 120 Denier Bright Silk, sold at the lowest price of 3.75 million yuan, more than ten thousand yuan less than the previous day.

In the past two days, the Electrical Industry Association sent out more than ten groups of staff to conduct on-site investigations at various silk factories to find out about the factory's operating conditions and the amount of artificial silk needed. The investigation was completed yesterday. The calculation data will be sent to the Central Trust Bureau today as a standard for the allotment of artificial silk in the coming week. Regarding the allotment method, the China Trust Bureau has consulted with the Textile Construction Company once. China Trust and Textile Construction will allot it jointly. China Trust is responsible for supplying manufacturers, and China Trust entrusts Textile Construction to be responsible for selling to silk merchants. The entrusted sales contract has not yet been finalized by both parties. The China Trust Bureau and the Supply Trust Bureau will allot it eight times a month, twice a week. After the demand of each manufacturer is determined, the full amount can be requested at one time, or two or three times can be requested, which is also acceptable. Assuming that each factory is allotted ten boxes per month, each time two and a half boxes are allotted. If a factory takes four boxes at one time and six boxes at another, they are free to do so. In short, they cannot exceed ten boxes per month in order to allow each factory to plan their business. The China Trust Bureau has now created a registration card for each applying manufacturer, with the power and production volume of each factory and the amount of allotment required, all of which are noted for long-term reference. Due to time constraints, allotment can be carried out first. After investigation, if any discrepancies are found in the report, the allotment qualification will be revoked, and they will not have the right to purchase artificial silk without capital. Regarding the future allotment price of artificial silk, the person in charge of the China Trust Bureau said: It will definitely not exceed the past allotment price of Textile Construction. What is the allotment price? It will be decided temporarily at the time of allotment. If there are no special accidents, allotment can be started next week.

### Social Bureau Orders Investigation and Reporting of Unclaimed Flour Warehouse Receipts; Registration of Wheat Transactions for Record

### Taiwan Sugar Allotment Statistics Table; A Total of Sixteen Instalments, 272,449 Packages

Since the Taiwan Sugar Corporation began allotting sugar at parity prices, it has allotted to the 17th instalment by this Saturday. The number of allotments has been increased or decreased each time according to actual needs and the quantity of arrivals. The applicants for the last instalment and this instalment were very limited. According to the person in charge of the company's business office: Recently, as the weather has turned cooler, the peak season for sugar sales has passed. Therefore, actual sales have been sluggish. At the same time, the allocation amount in the recent period has been supplied as much as possible, and the sugar merchants have sufficient reserves. Therefore, after the recent increase in the price, the black market price is instead lower. The company's current inventory is abundant, and future allotments will be oversupplied. It has been learned that the company has allotted a total of 272,449 packages from the first instalment to the sixteenth instalment. The price and allotment amount of each instalment are recorded below. (The price is in units of 100 yuan)

Note: The sixteenth instalment was cotton sugar No. 1, which was more expensive. The rest was medium crude sugar.

### China United Team Changes Strategy; Battling the Qun Sheng Team Again to Determine the Winner; Tonight at 7:30 PM at the Municipal Stadium

The Philippine Qun Sheng basketball team has won eight consecutive games in Shanghai. Its prestige and appeal are greater than the Lianghua Five Tigers of the past. The Municipal Stadium has repeatedly set the highest attendance record. The Shanghai champion, China United, has also been defeated. This battle is unanimously recognized as the Qun Sheng team's most successful performance since visiting Shanghai. Its shooting accuracy was nine out of ten, while China United was abnormal. Therefore, the result of this battle cannot be used to determine superiority. The two teams will play again at 7:30 PM today at the Municipal Stadium on South Shaanxi Road. The referees are Qu Honglv and Wang Shoufang. Ticket prices remain the same, 2,000 yuan upstairs and 5,000 yuan downstairs.

Now, with this good opportunity, they will surely be able to boost their spirits and seek revenge. Therefore, the excitement of this battle will surpass the previous one. China United's players are all in normal condition. The defeat in the previous battle was due to improper tactics. According to China United's athletes, they have a deep understanding of the characteristics of the Qun Sheng team and are confident that they will have a satisfactory performance in today's battle.

Civil Affairs Brief

### Executive Yuan Orders Investigation of Publicly Owned Land in Provinces and Cities; Pilot Program to Grant Land to the Families of Soldiers Killed in Action During the War of Resistance

The municipal government received an order from the Executive Yuan, stating that during the War of Resistance, our brave soldiers gave their lives on the battlefield, sacrificing themselves to the utmost, in glory and heroism, surpassing previous history. Those who are registered in the war death register have been given preferential treatment separately. The distribution and living conditions of their families are difficult to investigate in detail. Considering the difficulties in life and the loss of support for the old and weak, we should find ways to provide relief to show care. It is essential to implement widespread cultivation of publicly owned land in various provinces and cities to ensure that no land is left uncultivated and that land is used to its full potential. The provincial and municipal governments should conduct a thorough investigation of the distribution of public land in their respective provinces and cities, select land to pilot the granting of land to the families of soldiers killed in action during the War of Resistance, and ensure that they can cultivate themselves and that the old and weak are taken care of, to supplement the inadequacy of compensation and relief.

### Municipal Government Employees' Cooperative; Self-Government Personnel Allowed to Join

The Civil Affairs Department approved a letter from the Municipal Government Employees' Consumer Cooperative, stating that many district offices and Baojia chiefs, street cleaners, and technicians have applied to join as members. The board of directors has resolved to "allow them to join." They are hereby providing the member registration guidelines and requesting that the various district offices and Baojia chiefs be investigated and verified, and registered in accordance with the procedures, pay the shares, and participate as members.

### Explaining Two Issues: "XX Shi" and "Concubine"

During the concentrated training of household registration personnel organized by the Civil Affairs Department, when explaining how to fill in the "Name" and "Title" columns of the household registration review, there have been articles discussing the issues of "XX Shi" and "Concubine" in the newspaper. Hereby, the two issues of "XX Shi" and "Concubine" are clarified below:

(1) A name is a symbol of a person. Therefore, the Name Usage Restriction Ordinance promulgated by the National Government stipulates that the real name of a citizen of the Republic of China is limited to one, and the name registered in the household registration is the real name. This household registration review is to apply for household registration on behalf of the people. Filling in the name means that the citizens' legal rights and obligations can be guaranteed. To adapt to practical needs, it was supplemented during the lectures that when a woman is too old to be addressed by her name, "XX Shi" is allowed.

(2) "Concubine" has no legal status if married after May 5, 1931. It is not appropriate to register her in the household register. According to the Ministry of Interior's letter Yu Hu Zi No. 1110 dated November 20, 1933, and the Yu Hu Er Dian dated 1946, it should be filled in as "Cohabitant" or other family member (not just the word "Family Member," pay attention).

(3) Household registration is based on the application of the people. If the people apply to list two or more wives, the household registration authority cannot refuse to register, because the household registration authority is a detached registration agency, not a stakeholder of the people.

### District News Briefs

The 30th District (Yangjing) District Office held a household registration symposium for all staff members the other day. The household registration review work has been completed.

The 6th District (Lujiawan) District People's Congress, originally scheduled to hold its first meeting today (the 6th), is now learned to have been rescheduled to the 20th of this month, still to be held at Danjing Temple on Yongjia Road.

The Bao chiefs of the 6th District, in order to respond to the campaign to donate schools to celebrate the leader's sixtieth birthday, held a symposium the other day at the Huanlong Hotel on Nanchang Road. It was decided to follow the methods decided by the Municipal Education Bureau.

The 6th District Office held a Bao cadre work review discussion meeting at 2:00 PM on the 3rd of this month in the conference room. The current self-government affairs and the work to be implemented were discussed in detail.

The 23rd District (Wusong) District Office convened a joint meeting of various agencies in Songdi at 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 4th in the office's conference room to discuss preparations for expanding the celebration of National Day.

Film and Drama

### Talking About Actors' Attitudes

— Gao Heng

Actors—performing artists, have a direct relationship with the audience on stage. They convey the playwright's and director's consciousness and emotions in the performance. They carry out the task of art in education. They must enable the audience to understand and recognize art. Therefore, in each performance, directors, playwrights, stage workers, and even many enthusiastic art audiences place great hope on the actors, because the actors account for a large element of the success of a play.

Therefore, many actors must be as cautious, humble, diligent, and progressive as if they were facing a deep abyss or walking on thin ice in terms of skill training, artistic cultivation, and life attitude; in order to ensure their own achievements and for the future of the entire drama industry.

However, there are quite a few actors who are obsessed with their own acting skills, stubbornly clinging to their own artistic concepts, distorting the purpose of the performance, being sloppy in rehearsals, improvising during performances; the depravity of private life is beyond what you can imagine, what is stage cooperation, artistic conscience is even more irrelevant to me!

Naturally, this cannot be completely negated! There are also actors with profound attainments in Shanghai in recent years. But there are too few.

An actor must do: seek seriousness in art, seek sincerity in rehearsals, never be sloppy during performances, and not boast after performances, be serious in learning spirit, not be chaotic in life attitude, not casually mooch, not arbitrarily guerilla, be able to do not a "performer" but a "dramatic artist."

Currently, the most serious theatrical atmosphere in Shanghai is the "Audience Performance Company." Their rehearsals, their private lives, their artistic style, and their artistic attitude are all upright, without any perfunctory. This good style is indeed playing a role in several leaders, however, the most important thing is each actor's own self.

### Props and Excitement

— Wen Quan

This issue is often overlooked. This is a fundamental issue; prop managers often consider themselves to be affairs, not artists. Therefore, they often do not add creativity and do things perfunctorily. This leads others to not value　　　, and further to despise workers.

The prop manager of the New Drama Art Institute　　　, like other departments　　, must have superb artistic cultivation,　　　historical foundation, rich social common sense, a spirit of hard work and complaint, and an attitude of earnest study. We must also understand mechanics, aesthetics, and the unity of greatness. Never exceed the integrity of the performing arts. At the same time, we must also have the obligation and conscience to complete the great art required by all departments.

The following classification is made to serve as a path for managers to study:

(1) By country of origin: Chinese furniture is mostly vermilion, rosewood, ochre, and black. The purpose is to create a feeling of solemnity, dignity, and stability. Therefore, the materials are mostly heavy, the lines are mostly straight, the colors are mostly dark, and the structures are mostly complex. Western furniture mostly uses silver, white, yellow, or ochre and red. The purpose is beauty, comfort, and simplicity. Therefore, the materials are mostly light, the lines are mostly round, the colors are mostly bright, and the structures are mostly simple. Especially less use of carving.

(2) By dynasty: In ancient Chinese feudal times, the world was conquered by force. All furniture sought to be powerful and heavy. Therefore, tiger skin armchairs and tiger leg desks were produced. After respecting rituals, tables and chairs sought to be square and upright. Therefore, the back of the chair stood upright and did not tilt. By the time of the flourishing of art in the Tang Dynasty, tables, chairs, and beds exhausted the ability of meticulous carving, changing the old look. During the heyday of Greek architectural art, the structure of tables, chairs, and footrests was extremely beautiful and met gravity; especially the slender and fine round pillar table and chair legs had the meaning of architecture. 18th-century France was accustomed to vanity. Therefore, strange forms, gorgeous carvings, dazzling colors, comfortable cushions, and golden splendor were all available. After the development of modern science, streamlined, comfortable, and beautiful furniture was produced endlessly. This is a gift of the times and also expresses the characteristics of the times.

(3) By type of drama: There are different types and performances of dramas, such as tragedies, comedies, farces, and farces, as well as romantic, classical, realistic, fantasy, and mechanical compositions. All designs for directing, scenery, lighting, acting, costumes, props, and makeup will therefore be different. We know this: tragedies should create an atmosphere that evokes terror and pity, colors should be dark, lines should be straight, and shapes should be heavy. Comedies should create a bright and joyful atmosphere, colors should be bright, lines should be soft, and shapes should be light. Farces and farces should create a humorous and lively atmosphere. Therefore, colors should be bright, lines should be oblique, and shapes should be chaotic and clumsy. Other romantic ones should dare to indulge, classical ones should be familiar with history, realistic ones should be thoughtful and meticulous, and fantasy ones should be creative and organized, and mechanically constructed ones should understand mechanics and machinery.

(4) By volume: We call large volumes furniture or large props, and small volumes decorative small props and personal small props. Large props are no longer described in detail. Decorative small props are small things that decorate the scene. Such as picture frames, vases, books, etc. There is an absolute difference between the wine glasses and tableware at 18th-century banquets and the wine glasses and tableware in China. Similarly, there are also great differences in colors and forms between the Tang Dynasty and the Qing Dynasty, the Qing Dynasty and the Republic of China, and the Republic of China and the post-War of Resistance. As for personal small props, they are full of personality and identity expression. Managers must not ignore them because they are small.

In short, the color of props has not surpassed the form, but it is also not weaker than the form. The general application is between the scenery and the costume. If it is too opposite to the costume and scenery, it will be uncoordinated. If it is too close, it will be easily "eaten" away. However, if the manager can use brilliance and dare to create, all laws will retreat behind wisdom.

When modern Western Europe performed fantasy plays, they used machines to make tables and chairs rotate and change. I also think that managers in our country, whether they use colors, lines, or light and dark, can also give props rotation and change; but this change is internal, not physical, spiritual, not mechanical.

### Review of "Unofficial History of the Qing Palace"

I read "Record of the Guangxu Emperor's Personal Rule" in Guilin and found it to be tightly knit and concise. This play writes about national politics from the life of the palace, from waking up early to comb hair, tending the garden, selecting concubines, and celebrating birthdays to discussing national defense and Japanese invaders, from family laws, foreign affairs, national essence, and the Supreme Induction Chapter to writing about the end of the Manchu Qing. And all of this is only for the sake of the Aisin Gioro family, for the sake of Empress Dowager Cixi, and for the sake of Li Lianying. What national affairs, family laws, are actually all the ideas of Chief Eunuch Li alone. And this is indeed a story of recent Chinese history. This story still affects us Chinese people, and this kind of story has been repeated countless times in Chinese history. We should be very familiar with this kind of story.

That Empress Dowager Cixi, she certainly thought of herself as highly talented and virtuous, with great achievements and hard work, and added dozens of nice-sounding titles to herself, but in reality, she was just a capable wealthy woman. She did many bad things, she knew it in her heart, she just didn't allow others to say it, whoever said it, she would kill. But when she killed Kou Liancai, she herself also cried, it seems she still had a little humanity. As for the likes of Li Lianying, they didn't even have this bit of humanity. Before Kou Liancai died, he did not forget to say some vicious words. He was so vicious, yet he demanded that others have a conscience, that's truly beyond comprehension! And Weng Shifu only wanted to pluck Li Hongzhang's peacock feather and take off Li Hongzhang's yellow mandarin jacket, but when asked for money to build the navy, he had none, but when it came to paying indemnities, he could come up with ideas. It can be seen that the government officials at that time were just like this, but Weng Shifu ultimately did not agree with losing power and humiliating the country. Compared with Rong Lu and his ilk, he was far worse. The author often uses contrasting scenes to express these characters profoundly, the structure is rigorous, and the editing is precise. It is indeed very successful in grasping the audience's attention.

I have seen Ye Zi's play many times in Guilin and Zunyi. This time, she really brought out Empress Dowager Cixi's shrewishness, cleverness, meticulousness, cunning, arbitrariness, and ruthlessness. Her several smiles, several times of fake happiness, fake compassion, and several times of concern for Li Lianying, were all performed appropriately and clearly, making it very comfortable to watch. Mr. Yang Hua played Li Lianying, with a tilted head and twisted neck, speaking in a strange voice, acting out a flattering, arrogant, bullying, selfish, self-serving, insidious, and vicious character, winning the audience's resentment. In addition, Kou Liancai's youth—which includes the roles of innocence, justice, and courage—is the only lovable character in the play. Li Hongzhang was first wronged by Weng Shifu and then controlled by Li Lianying. His kind of suffering that he couldn't express was truly rare. The roles in the whole play are very well matched, only that actor, even with the support of Li Lianying's siblings, what he did was not a good thing after all. He was so stubborn that he was not afraid at all in front of the Empress Dowager and the Emperor. Isn't that a bit too much!

### Twenty Years of Sound Film

— Jiang

This year marks the 20th anniversary of Warner's release of sound films. Jack L. Warner, the founder of the company, described his efforts for the film industry over the past 20 years. Translating it for reference is not without significance.

Twenty years ago, the experiment of sound film was successful; our years of work have also yielded some results, but the development of sound film to the present situation, how could anyone have expected it!

When we started the film business, it was only a very small theater reorganized from a department store. At that time, my father pawned his most beloved gold watch to raise the capital for the opening, and the seats were also borrowed in terms of equipment.

It was not until 1912 that we started making films ourselves from running theaters. We have always held the spirit of struggle and adventure, although we have encountered many setbacks; but it has also laid the foundation for our business.

In order to make our ideals come true. In other words, in order to hope for the successful experiment of sound film, we are willing to bet all our financial resources or energy on it. Of course, we finally won; but this victory was seen after a long dark night, and my brother Sam L. Warner died for the business during that time.

As all walks of life celebrate our successful release of sound films, we have also shouldered a new appointment, a work of promoting democracy and making films in line with the democratic trend of the world. American films have indeed fulfilled many obligations for democratic countries, at least they have a deeper understanding of their own environment because of this.

During the war, American films can be said to have lived up to their role as national propaganda tools, and in terms of soldier training, films have also shortened a lot of training time.

We can be proud of the success of sound films, and we are even more proud of our achievements in all aspects over the past 20 years. We can take advantage of opportunities, be responsible, and we have always been running forward!

### Competition of American, British and French Films in the Market

— New Film

If American film companies want to maintain their past advantages in the European market, they will encounter an unprecedented difficult period. In the past, the strong enemy of Hollywood films in Europe was Germany. Now that Germany is defeated, the successors are Britain and France. Because Britain and France will seize the European film market in the future, preparing to produce a large number of films that cater to the audience's psychology.

The British post-war film industry has unique ambitions. In addition to having a large amount of capital, it also cooperates with Hollywood film companies. The foundation has already been laid, as long as it can proceed step by step according to the plan. Once the production of French films increases considerably, they can grab the French film audience. The difficulties that American films will encounter in Europe can be seen from this.

Film industry giants believe that in two or three years, French films will not only be produced in large quantities, but also improve in quality. Especially in stories, new ideals are mixed in. French films are better than Hollywood films in terms of imagination and taste, especially with local characteristics.

European film audiences like new ideals and new technologies. Regarding these, France often has a special skill. But now, if we expect these films to be produced in Paris, it is too early. We can only watch Hollywood produce them. However, the recent Hollywood production "A Scandal in Paris" already has a continental European character, but this kind of film is not very common.

Especially in Hollywood, films are completely commercialized. Ordinary film companies do not make films for the effect of the film, but the only purpose is to make money. Why is this? Because in the past six years, although there has been war, the profits of various film companies have been so high that they have exceeded expectations, so technical aspects have not been fully taken care of. If this style is not changed in the future, it will inevitably lose the overseas market, especially the European market, because there are Britain and France competing with it.

### Chen Dahu Comes to Shanghai to Visit His Family

Yu School Laosheng (Old Male Role) Chen Dahu, recently flew from Peiping (Beijing) to Shanghai. Personnel from the Queen's Grand Theater also returned to Shanghai on the same plane. It is heard that Chen's trip was because his eldest brother recently returned from Chongqing, so he came to visit him. On his way back, he may stay in Peiping for a while. The photo shows Chen Dahu in his recent performance of "Fishing and Killing Family".

### Today's Garbo, Ingrid Bergman

— New Fang

A beautiful flower, a virtuous wife and loving mother, a companion in loneliness; Ingrid Bergman was born in this era full of thorns, and she did bring warmth and comfort. Hollywood's film industry cannot do without her, she is simply everyone's dream angel!

What Ingrid Bergman admires most is Garbo. They are both Swedish. Twenty years ago, Hollywood was Garbo's world; now Garbo's position is replaced by Bergman. For decades, the American silver screen has been occupied by Swedes; Garbo and Bergman can be said to have won a lot of glory for their motherland.

Ordinary women are generally fond of vanity and value fame and fortune; this situation is especially obvious in the theater circle, but Ingrid Bergman is an exception. She does not value fame, does not value profit, and does not love any artificial decorations; she has natural beauty, a gentle and virtuous appearance, she treats people with humility, and works seriously; in order to truly praise this artist, and also to truly let the audience know this artist, let us mention a few more things about Bergman. Once, a reporter asked Ingrid Bergman; "Miss Bergman, will you ever retire from the film industry?" Her answer was very funny: "Why do I want to retire from the film industry? Don't you think it would be fun when I am seventy years old to act again!" She must be a career-oriented artist. She is only thirty years old this year, from thirty to seventy there are still forty years! Ingrid Bergman can be said to be an extremely popular star, but she never despises others because of this; she often eats alone in the St. Regis Hotel in New York, and does not like the waiter's excessive courtesy when dining, and the food she eats per meal is absolutely simplified, she never wears a hat when going out or attending banquets, which is also very strange in American society. Ingrid Bergman is serious when working, and is also very loyal to all social or group affairs after work; during the war, she tried her best to promote public bonds, and every time she traveled around to promote public bonds, she always asked her husband before starting: "If you want others to buy public bonds, you must first ask how much we have bought ourselves?", Ingrid Bergman is not willing to lag behind others in saving the country. Her success today is not only her success in the film industry, but also her success in the art of being a person.

Ingrid Bergman's latest work is "Notorious" co-starring with Cary Grant. Including this film, she has only acted in twelve films in Hollywood, but she has already established an immortal reputation for herself!

### Actress Zhao Yunru

— Zeng Wei

Zhao Yunru, undoubtedly, she is a brilliant star in the drama world. Her trip to the United States to study this time is worth everyone's envy.

When Ms. Zhao was eighteen years old, she became interested in drama. However, her family did not allow her to embark on this path, and sent her to Hankou to study. Unexpectedly, there were also foreign movies in Hankou, and Ms. Zhao would of course go to watch them. She was always interested in acting. One year, she learned that the Nanjing Drama School was recruiting students, and she was determined to apply, but how to go was a difficult problem, but she finally found a solution, she had an uncle in Nanjing, so she went to visit him.

In that exam, there were five hundred applicants, and only thirty passed. Women accounted for only eight of the thirty, and Ms. Zhao was one of them. When this news reached her family in Suzhou, they all felt sorry for her, saying that she was an unfilial daughter.

Soon after, the Anti-Japanese War broke out, and Ms. Zhao transferred from Nanjing to Yichang, and finally to Chongqing, and became a drama star.

She performed "Unofficial History of the Qing Palace" in Chongqing for more than forty days in a row, and the box office was of course good. This play was performed for six hours every day, and she needed to be on stage for five hours, so you can imagine how tiring it was.

Ms. Zhao was very timid when she first appeared on stage in Chongqing. Later, she worked hard to make her performance realistic. Once, she was wearing lipstick, draped in an old coat, and leaning against a telegraph pole while smoking a cigarette. An old woman who was a prostitute said to her: "Your luck is not good today!" So she knew that her role-playing was good. She was able to practice the role-playing of peasant women and village women like this.

Spring and Autumn

### The Growth of American Literature and Its Characteristics

— Jingwen

Some say that although American literature has a history of three hundred years, its prosperity is only a matter of yesterday. In terms of American history, this is indeed the case. However, although the growth period of American literature is shorter than that of the Old Continent, just as the founding of the United States has its unique spirit, American literature also has its own independent spiritual characteristics.

In terms of the founding background of the United States, the early helpers of American literature naturally took Puritanism as the core; strictly speaking, there was no so-called American literature at that time, there were only religious literature and historical records and a few poems. Such as William Bradford (1590-1657)'s "History of the Plymouth Colony"; John Winthrop (1568-1649)'s "History of New England"; Cotton Mother's "History of the New England Church," etc.; in terms of rhyme, such as Michael WiggWiggorth (1631-1705)'s long poem "The Day of Doom," and the female poet Anne Bradstreet (1612-72)'s "The Tenth Muse," and so on.

These things were all works before American independence. At that time, American capitalism was still in its infancy, and its literary expression could only rely on the anti-religious spirit.

But the New World is a uniquely blessed place in terms of resources, and at the same time, the American immigrants who came from religious oppression in the Old Continent had to have a spirit that was close to reality and full of adventure due to the enlightenment of the environment. Therefore, there was a simultaneous formation of a dialectical existence with religious literature, and what completely replaced religious literature in no time was not the so-called "Yankee spirit."

If Puritanism can be said to be a relic brought from the Old Continent, then Yankeeism can be said to be entirely a product that came with the independent development of the American capitalist economy in its early stages. In the era of Puritanism, although immigrants from the Old Continent to America resisted their mother country economically, they were still somewhat influenced by the Old Continent spiritually. However, with the independent development of the American economy, its spiritual centrifugal tendency to the Old Continent became increasingly obvious. Yankeeism is a product of this spiritual centrifugal tendency. The initial revelation of Yankeeism's resistance was also in the political aspect. A new economic representative class emerged, such as Benjamin Franklin, who was a typical representative of the emerging American middle class at that time. His "Autobiography" and "Poor Richard's Almanac" not only had political ideas and life philosophies that were very different from Puritanism, but also broke away from the traditional religious odor in its literary expression and took a unique path.

Of course, Franklin cannot be said to be a representative figure in American literature at that time; at the same time, because the American independence movement quickly achieved success, the political resistance movement did not get the opportunity to develop fully in American literary history; on the contrary, because the independence movement was quickly achieved and economic development progressed by leaps and bounds, a general optimism and hope in life made the newborn American literature advocate a free and happy spirit. In terms of American literary history, this was the era of American romanticist literature. The literary representatives of this period can be said to be Washington Irving, James Fenimore Cooper, and William Cullen Bryant.

However, in the strict sense, the works of Irving and others have not yet completely eliminated the color of Puritanism, which is naturally related to the education of these people themselves. The truly independent and free period of American literature should be said to have started around the time of the Civil War. During this period, the United States began to produce its own great writers, whose reputations were all unsurpassed by world writers. Such as Nathaniel Hawthorne, who wrote "The Scarlet Letter," Ralph Waldo Emerson, a writer and philosopher, John Pendleton Kennedy, a pastoral writer, Edgar Allan Poe, a humorous writer Mark Twain... these great writers integrated and developed the literary development path of Europe over the centuries on the basis of America's own unique foundation in a short period of time.

However, what exactly is the American spirit expressed in the American literary development path that ultimately came from Puritanism and Yankeeism? This can be observed from two angles, that is, in the case of expressing personality, the American literary spirit is the spirit of individualism, and in the case of experiencing society, it is the spirit of liberalism. These two things that seem contradictory at first glance are actually a complete unity of the American spirit and cannot be separated. The early American literature's tendency towards mysticism, as well as the modern American literature's tendency towards vulgarity (or, more euphemistically, mass tendency), are the respective characteristics of Puritanism and Yankeeism. However, in modern times, mysticism has been gradually replaced by vulgarism; although the literature of individualism has not been completely eliminated, the promotion of the spirit of liberalism seems to be more characteristic of the modern American literary spirit. Writers of the Theodore Drelser and Haiqing school are mass and liberal writers.

The reason why the American literary spirit has timely characteristics is that the earliest colonists of the United States were originally people from the Old Continent. Although they emigrated to the New Continent for superficial religious reasons, the foundation of their spirit was still the tradition of the Old Continent; its early literature's flow from religious color to mysticism can be said to be the result of the interaction between the old legend and the new Jing Suo's expectations. The so-called new expectations mean that the development of the American colonies not only attracted immigrants from Britain, but also attracted a complex and powerful people of various races from all over the world. The reason why the United States calls itself the United States of America just illustrates the complex nature of the entire composition. From conservative Puritanism to gradual development into Yankeeism, this is how the unique spirit of the American character in the Moonlight appeared. Up to now, the lively, unrestrained, realistic, and almost romantic Yankeeism is still the basic characteristic of American literature today. Understanding this point, we can then observe modern American literature.

### Milestone (Plus One)

— Peng Aohan

Pointing out the direction for travelers of life, the milestone stands alone and lonely at the desolate intersection

Having encountered many times of wind and rain, the milestone still stands stubbornly with its bare and smooth body. …

From the remote era, when mankind opened up routes, milestones were placed at this intersection that easily confused travelers.

With a good heart to help others, the milestone gives travelers a sudden comfort.

"And life! But it is so dry and bumpy!"

When the milestone complained in a low voice, I sighed softly. …

### Floating Smoke and Distant Peaks

— Qing Dynasty Wang Jian

### Cemetery

Longing for the desolation and mystery in the cemetery, I silently stepped into the chaotic and messy mounds

Those piles of protruding yellow mounds! How many dreams of nameless heroes have been buried!

The glorious deeds of the past should now be historical terms.

When the green will-o'-the-wisps jumped on the edge of the cemetery, I could still hear the weeping of the mournful ghosts. …

"This tragic final destination!"

So, I slowly, with a sad mood, mourned the undying heroic spirits of the dead

### Song of Feeling After Opening the American Military Food Box

— Bao Luo

Food boxes are sold in the market, said to be American military rations; how can the distribution of rations be unlimited? Many soldiers died and were wounded!

The stacked boxes are tightly aligned, filled with sugar and fruit, fragrant lemon acidity, rich and strong coffee bitterness, I light a cigarette, quietly remembering the past and present!

After the meal, there is a residual taste, leaving this to know who it is? The bones in the sandy field are cold, and relatives and friends are crying sadly

The weather is cold and the wind and snow are severe, the guest's soul is lonely and alone! The world is not completely settled, I advise everyone not to rush to change the transmission circuit. And wait for the evil atmosphere to be cleansed, when spring arrives, I will return to write poems. I secretly laugh at my parents shedding tears together, and the babies cry tiredly and fall asleep quickly. The fragrant grass is lush and green, and we play and dance together. From then on, the days will be peaceful, and we will not worry about the beacon fires and enjoy the heavenly years!

### An Inch of Mountains and Rivers, An Inch of Blood 54

— Ye Jingfeng

I was also confused at first, but after chasing a few more steps, my heart suddenly moved, and I couldn't help but shout out, "It's over!"

"What's wrong?" the young captain slowed down and asked.

"After turning around this mound, it's our power station," I pointed in the direction of the three guys and said. "Probably our place has been occupied by them, and there may be a large team stationed there!"

The leader stopped immediately after hearing this and gave a gesture to his colleagues. Everyone gathered around as soon as they saw it: only one person straightened the hand-held machine gun and stood aside to take guard. (This is a trained regulation, a natural action step, no need to issue another order). The leader asked me to explain the terrain of the radio station on the other side of the mountain. I immediately pointed out the direction and terrain. The leader then very skillfully gave the order: five people in a team, with the power station in front of the mountain as the center, surrounded from left and right, and asked me to join a team at random. I agreed to walk on the highway side with the leader.

I understood his division very well; probably after he heard me explain the terrain, because he didn't know the enemy's strength, but it might be quite strong, he expected that after the few guys who escaped reported back, they might all come over the mountain to copy our back road. If so, we would be able to sandwich them from both sides with such a division. In case their team still took the road where the three people escaped, and they came to meet us head-on, we could also attack from the front and back, just wait for our division to reach the front of the mountain.

Who knew that we explored step by step, and when we reached the front of the mountain, we saw at a glance that our residence (radio station) was empty, and only a burst of burning gas, mixed with the smell of smoke, rolled up from the foot of the mountain. Our residence was still intact. But turning our faces to see the power plant at the foot of the mountain, there were two places emitting thick smoke. Looking at the top of the mountain again, it was as if there were no traces of people. When we got to the side of the house, we explored it very carefully, fearing an ambush, but our division had already sent a signal, indicating that they had not seen any enemy traces, so we attacked an empty place. This was because we overestimated the strength of the people.

At this time, I didn't care about anything, I just told the young leader that I wanted to search the house. The leader assigned people to their posts and explored the house with me. The first thing to check was of course my office and the generator. I couldn't wait to flash into the room, and saw that everything had been moved. I rushed to the head of the kang and opened the cabinet, and there was nothing left, even a few clothes that were used for cover were taken away. This was of course expected. But I was also very sad in my heart. Because that generator was very difficult to get, this thing is not only a non-selling product, but there are only a few of them in Japan now. Just as I was staring at the closet in a daze, the room suddenly lit up. It turned out that the sky was getting dark, and I could no longer see things clearly in the room. It was the leader who turned on the light.

With this light, one thing in the closet flashed into my eyes; it was a symbol drawn with a red pencil, and "〇四" was written next to it. I was overjoyed, this symbol indicates that the thing was taken away by number 〇四; at the same time, I can also find him based on this symbol. But now it is even more urgent, I think it is still the safety issue of Dingyuan's family and the children in the Road Bureau power plant. Because in our station, number 〇四 is a leader. He took things away, and the houses here were not burned. He and the other accomplices, whether they were trained, some experienced men and women, probably had already escaped. Thinking of this, I couldn't care about anything else, I just turned around and explained to the leader that I wanted to go to the power plant to visit Dingyuan's family and other refugees.

### The Key

— Fengzi

To have a home, or to have a room of one's own, to be able to close the door and enjoy a limited freedom, to sit, lie, and move according to one's own habits, without having to worry about a pair of eyes watching you, staring at you, without feeling flustered. In this environment that belongs to oneself, one can maintain a calm mood, and arrange and deal with everything according to one's own likes and dislikes. Whether rich or poor, wise or foolish, if given such an environment, there is no reason to complain about the unfairness of fate.

Happiness cannot be separated from troubles, and fate is always to be complained about. Some people have a house, but before they can enjoy their share of happiness, troubles follow them like a shadow. Their hearts are as if chained, their hands and feet as if shackled. This small piece of freedom that belongs to them, yet those who live inside it are like prisoners in a jail. It is easy to be blamed for anything, and one must constantly reflect. When troubles come, problems multiply. Even a good-natured person can easily become abnormal, and cherished objects may be smashed with one's own hands. Things that are always with you sometimes lose their direction, or a manuscript that is right at hand, when you need it, refuses to appear no matter how much you call for it. Even more often, you might forget yourself outside the door. No matter how tired you are, how sleepy you are, even though with a simple movement you could curl up like a cat and throw yourself onto the bed. However, fate loves to play tricks on you, and your hand falls empty. A door separates you from another world. Curse it! A careless person deserves to be punished. Scolding yourself, hitting yourself is useless. It might be late at night, and the help you long for is unavailable. Unwilling to turn to friends, you have to risk showing off your skills, climbing walls and jumping through windows. In dire straits, anyone can play the hero from the Seven Heroes and Five Gallants. Afterwards, you might even boast about your innate ability to walk on walls, secretly rejoicing that you didn't fall and get hurt. No matter what you say, taking risks is always a last resort. No one deliberately punishes themselves. The painful thing is that innate troubles are invisible shadows, and you never know when they will follow you and demand a reckoning. Even the smartest person cannot find peace unless they suddenly disappear from the crowd, and there is no longer a self, so that troubles have no way to take root.

The consequences of troubles can be very serious. When the problem comes, even if you are a six-foot-tall strong man, you cannot turn yourself into various shapes and squeeze into various holes. At this time, even a gentleman wishes he had the cleverness of a thief, so that a piece of iron or a lead wire could get him whatever he wants. In human society, as long as there are thieves who live by their wits, human troubles will never be eliminated. Because of this, troubles become parasitic plants, able to take root anywhere, climbing and spreading, reaching friends, close relatives, and even couples in the same bed. Many secretly hide an invisible key, hoping to secretly check each other's secrets when the opportunity arises. You can't blame parents for being biased, because bias originates from selfish thoughts, and selfish thoughts arise from considerations of gains and losses. Whether emotional or material, everything starts from oneself. The most difficult thing between people is trust, and the easiest thing to lose is human affection, which is due to the inability to trust others.

What can be done? You tell me?

It seems that the most enviable thing in urban life is tall buildings, but in these layers of tall buildings, with their many doors, people living inside may all be happy, but how many can come and go freely? Even in their own small world, opening the door is still not enough to unlock the cabinets and drawers. Who are they locking up? Carrying a bunch of keys, the clanging sound, is it praising one's cleverness, or satirizing one's stupidity? If one is careless, the owner of the keys may lock himself into the hell of troubles. Who should be blamed then?

I curse keys from the bottom of my heart. From morning till night, coming and going, eating and going to the toilet, this bunch of keys always follows me like a shadow, always within half a foot of my sight. Losing the keys is like losing myself. I have been locked out, I have risked climbing the windows of a four-story building... As a result, I cannot help but regard it as my shadow, not even the closest person can leave me for a second. But I don't like it at all. It only gives me troubles, it threatens my freedom, it increases my distrust of people. Even of myself, the result of thinking about it day and night, I suspect that my nerves are not sound. But I don't have the courage to throw it away unless I leave this world.

When can I throw away this chain, break these shackles, jump out of this prison, and fly to the truly free world?

Is there such a place in the world? Where no one picks up lost items, and doors are left unlocked... When children come into the world, grow up and enter school, read history, and then go to museums to see the foolish relics left by these clever ancestors—keys and locks. If there really is such a day, there will never be war in the world.

Free Talk

### Tantrums

— Shaofu

"Heaven is silent, only humans speak."

However, human words added together become trust. If there is no trust, then human words are frightening. We see the hurricane-like surge of the U.S. dollar in the Shanghai market, forcing market chaos, and the Foreign Exchange Association has to take emergency measures to stop U.S. dollar transactions, and the cause is a "foreign exchange rates will be adjusted appropriately at any time," which increases the reporters' caution and attitude of walking on thin ice.

The market's nerves are extremely sharp and sensitive, and rumors are often created. If you give it the opportunity to attach to it, how can you avoid taking the opportunity to make waves? Of course, in the speculation of ups and downs, some people have made a fortune, but most people have suffered. Before the war, the economic situation was stable, and speculation was limited to a few people, and the impact on the market and people's livelihood was not great, but now, the so-called pull one hair and move the whole body, U.S. dollars, gold, cotton yarn, rice, ... any rise and fall, all prices change with it, so the windfall made by those few people is squeezed and looted from the lives of most of us.

Here, we must praise Mr. Bei Zuyi, the president of the Central Bank. Since taking office, he has always maintained a style of never speaking, and silently fighting against speculators. His hard fights have been experienced three times, the new foreign exchange adjustment in August, the U.S. dollar fluctuation in late September, and this surge. In addition, there are a number of large and small financial adjustment events. Like this time, the Central Bank threw 2,000 bars of gold, which is a powerful mainstream to curb the surge. From these places, we can understand that those in charge have not neglected their responsibilities.

### Chinese and Passes

— Hongyu

Before the war, in the Shanghai concessions, all were the power of foreigners. Although the territory was in China, the equality of foreigners' treatment of Chinese people was difficult to describe.

Take the British-owned tram company as an example. Foreigners buy monthly passes, the procedures are simple, and absolutely no photos are required. The Chinese are much more troublesome. First, they have to sign a contract that cannot violate the company's regulations, and then they issue a notice to take a photo at a designated photo studio before the procedure is complete. It takes three to five days to get the so-called "tram pass."

Their reason is that foreigners (including Japanese and White Russians) are all trustworthy and ethical, so photos are not required on monthly passes. If the Chinese do not use photos, they will definitely not use them themselves, lend them to others, and others will not use them, but also transfer them to third parties. In this way, there is no way to investigate, which easily causes losses to the tram company. Therefore, the Chinese must attach photos to their monthly passes. This is simply insulting the Chinese. It is also the Chinese's fault for not living up to expectations. If they can work together and not take his tram, see if this British tram company will not close down.

However, during the period of the fall, after the company changed to "military management," the Japanese used the "East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere" to win over our compatriots, and even the photos on the tram passes were all cancelled. We will never thank him for this preferential treatment, because he has already pasted our photos on the "citizen's card" that he must check at any time.

After the restoration of the land, the Shanghai concessions have been taken back. Although the tram company is still run by British merchants, it is controlled by our municipal government's public utilities bureau. How do I know that my tram pass today is still the same as before, the Chinese still have to paste photos, and the photos in the past were taken for free by the company, but now they have to do it themselves. Isn't this worse?

### Numbness

— Kuiran

The Public Utilities Bureau is in charge of him, and has the right to order the abolition of insulting photos on monthly passes. I specially offer my opinion in writing, and I hope that the Public Utilities Bureau will implement it soon!

After reading Mr. Weiyan's "Longer Review" in the October 3rd edition of this newspaper's publishing industry, I feel that not only is the administrative efficiency of our government slow, but the rate of handling affairs by the people is also unparalleled!

The author is a middle school geography teacher. The junior high school geography textbook taught in the last semester was Zhonghua's version. In the first chapter of the second volume, Fujian Province, there is a section on Taiwan, which is still "... bordering the Taiwan Strait to the east, suitable for the hub of traffic between the East China Sea and the South China Sea, and facing the lost island of Taiwan." Section 2, Guangdong Province: "The so-called leased land is Guangzhou Bay on the east coast of the Leizhou Peninsula. ... Occupied by the French in the 24th year of Guangxu, and leased to them by contract in the following year for a period of ninety-nine years, the French opened it as a complete military port."

At that time, it had been four months since the victory. I once wondered why the booksellers were so numb? Why not revise these two sections? Maybe it was too late to complete the procedures, so it was issued casually. But it has been half a year, and the second volume of geography textbooks issued to students this semester has not changed the slightest bit about these two sections. The strangest thing is that according to his publication date, it is August 30th. I don't understand, wasn't there a textbook shortage last semester? Why are there still textbooks printed in the 30th year that students read this semester? It is no problem to read textbooks printed in the 30th year in the 35th year. However, after a major change in the era, geography cannot be vague in these few years. And now what I have discovered, there are already the above two major problems, and there must be other places that do not meet the current application, and must not have been revised at all.

Looking back at the past, the Japanese attached great importance to geographical research. It is said that you can find a bookstore in Japan that specializes in selling Chinese geography. During the fall of Beijing and Shanghai, the first thing the enemy did in education was to change geography textbooks and confiscate maps in bookstores and libraries. Under this painful contrast, we feel ashamed even though we have won. After reading Mr. Weiyan's introduction and reflecting on the geography book I teach, it is more than just shame, it is simply that the education authorities and publishers are generally numb!

### It is said that there is such a thing - sleeping for thirty-nine years

— Jia Ling translated from Journal of Amreican Pharmaeutical Associltion July 1946

Survival is the basic desire of everyone, but disgust and dissatisfaction with reality are also common human traits. Many people want to leave this troubled world for a considerable period of time, wake up after a few years, and live a new life. So in the story of "Rip Van Winkle," this Rip slept for twenty years, woke up and the world had changed, and his old friends did not recognize each other, as if he were in another new world.

Recently, American zoologists discovered a roundworm Nematodes that slept for twice as long as Rip - thirty-nine years. This worm, scientifically named Tylenchus Polyhypnus, had five of these worms sleeping on a piece of dry wheat leaf that had been preserved for thirty-nine years. This worm, which sleeps for such a long time, has set a new record in the animal kingdom.

### Mencius' Mother Moved Three Times

— Wangwu

Mr. Bu, a neighbor, is well-read in ancient books. This time he "returned" to Shanghai, and his residence was occupied, but he still enjoyed it! Recently, he has innovated his thinking and is seeking a proper educational environment for his grandson, following Mencius' mother's intention of moving three times. He moved from Caojiadu to Nanshi, and then from Nanshi to Yuyuan Road. Recently, he has found a new home on Masnan Road, and his field property has been sold out. I am at peace.

Strange News of Trials of Traitors

After Wang Yitang, the No. 1 traitor in North China, was sentenced to death, he suddenly published advertisements in various newspapers in Beiping, saying that He Chengzhuo, the presiding judge of the case, was a "small traitor under his rule." Trying a traitor with a traitor (the small traitor in parentheses tries the No. 1 big traitor) is one oddity;

Since the traitor Wang Yitang had known that the presiding judge was a "small traitor under his rule," why didn't he pretend to be dead and not say it at the time, but instead revealed it afterwards? Outsiders don't know if there is an article in this, the second oddity;

Some people say that this may be "a dog bites Lu Dongbin, not knowing a good heart," because the traitor in parentheses is a real traitor, or an underground worker, we dare not speculate, but looking at the newspapers, He Chengzhuo himself does not seem to deny it, and does not mention underground work, the third oddity;

The newspapers in Beiping do not seem to be afraid of the suspicion of He Chengzhuo being a traitor, otherwise they would not have rashly published this irresponsible "traitor advertisement." (If this example is opened, there will be many traitor advertisements in the future!) Is it to protect Wang Yitang? Is it to attack He Chengzhuo? Is it to greed for advertising revenue? It seems that none of them are, but it also seems that they are all related, the fourth oddity;

As a dignified presiding judge, being bitten back by Wang Yitang, who has been sentenced to death, in terms of judicial dignity and official prestige, it is really "too that!" The fifth oddity;

When Wang Yitang will be executed is still unpredictable, and he may even apply for a retrial, or even develop an "case in a case," the sixth oddity! Is a dog biting Lu Dongbin?

### Record of Robbery

— Yidan

When the weather is cool but not cold, the thugs have already begun to move.

The Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo station and its vicinity outside Xiaonanmen were devastated by enemy bombs during the Shanghai War. Now, more than a year after the victory, it is still a wilderness.

If you want to go from Datong University to China Electric Company, you have to cross this wilderness of about several hundred yards. There are no outposts, no street lights, and there are weeds and messy bricks, cement ditches. It is even more deserted at night, which makes pedestrians uneasy and coachmen afraid.

A few days ago, at about 10:00 p.m., a neighbor, Old Sun, had just passed Datong University when he was chased up by a thug, wearing a broken hat, greasy and broken tops, holding a "weapon" in his hand, and yelling, "Where are you going?" About 30,000 legal tender was robbed, and then he threw a handkerchief of smoke and other things, and then pushed him hard. Another accomplice suddenly rushed out from a hidden place and disappeared into the darkness.

Such road robberies seem to be regarded as trivial matters, but looking at it in depth, you will feel that it is a social problem and also a public security problem in the suburbs. Now, before a fundamental solution can be found, it is proposed that the relevant Penglai District authorities should be asked to set up a police station there, and send police to guard it, and install a red light on the top of the station, which will be no less effective than a lighthouse in the Black Sea. Otherwise, when the cold wind is howling, the thugs will be even more rampant. What about our pedestrians?

### Please Think About It

— Suobei

Think about it: Are the following situations in line with your subconscious?

(1) When someone asks you, you agree readily, but in your heart "don't look at anything"; Lao Tzu said: "Those who promise lightly must have little faith." Are you this kind of person?

(2) When you are a daughter-in-law, you complain everywhere about the bad things about your mother-in-law, but when your son marries a daughter-in-law, you complain everywhere that "my son has a wife and doesn't want his old mother!" Think about it, are you like this yourself?

(3) Do you think that the "feng shui" of your parents' graves will affect your wealth, so you find all the "feng shui" masters to bury your parents, but use this to praise your filial piety?

(4) When you print on your parents' funeral notices "Unfilial and so on, the sins are deep, not to perish, but to extend the life of the late father... and so on," do you know that this is the "No. 1" nonsense?

### Outsider's View

— Dai

This is the dialectic of Yan'an: If Mao Zedong becomes the chairman of the "Soviet People's Committee of the Republic of China" and the general secretary of the party, Zhou Enlai must be the chairman of the Foreign Affairs People's Committee, and of course Zhu De is the supreme commander of the Red Army of the Republic of China. "Rewarding merits and awarding rewards" should be like this.

A young man said: "Under the rule of the Republic of China government, it is really too difficult to climb to the position of chairman or committee member in one step. If you join the Communist Party, you may get a letter of appointment as a committee member in a few days!"

A person who runs a party said that the purpose of running a party is to gain political power. Who can deny this sentence? A person who joins a certain party said: This is a shortcut to seek an official at risk!

### Written to Parents

— Hesong

The child came back from school, carrying a schoolbag. The schoolbag was full of books and many notebooks and exercise books. The child was very happy because the day's course was finally over, and he could play happily for a while.

The mother took the schoolbag and opened the notebooks and exercise books one by one, and said to the child, this is wrong, that is wrong; also, why is the arithmetic only 70 points, why can't Chinese get "super"?

The child's "happiness" turned into sorrow. He thought: This is the price he paid for studying for a day!

On the bright side, the child was stimulated by his mother and aroused his desire to be an "excellent student," and from then on he studied harder; on the bad side, the child felt that his efforts were a waste, and became negative and discouraged.

I would like to give a loyal warning to parents, don't always be critical of your children, but on the contrary, you should always encourage them! Encouragement is more effective than criticism.

Whenever a child puts on new shoes, his mother always says to him: "Hey, don't ruin these shoes, if you ruin them, you won't have shoes to wear!"

Therefore, the child dare not run, for fear of ruining the shoes, dare not jump, for fear of ruining the shoes; dare not play, dare not exercise! Shoes restrict everything and become shackles for children.

However, wise parents, you must know how important it is for children to move, play, and exercise... Don't sacrifice the health of the next generation for the sake of "shoes"!

Not long ago, an incident occurred: a fifth-grade elementary school student committed suicide because he could not be promoted.

We can imagine that when the child knew that he was "held back," his parents must have given him severe criticism - or even a beating. (In fact, I have seen this kind of thing many times.) The child could not bear this punishment and took his own life.

I am not encouraging children to be held back, but I want to tell you that school scores cannot accurately indicate whether a child is "good" or "bad," and setbacks in learning (such as being held back) are normal phenomena. Don't think that a child who is held back is useless and unteachable, and give him unbearable punishment!
