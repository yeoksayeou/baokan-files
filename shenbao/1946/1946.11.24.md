[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 23rd] Hu Haimen, a member of the Standing Committee of the Social Democratic Party, flew from Nanjing back to Beiping at 1:00 PM on the 23rd. Reporters visited Hu at his private residence. According to Hu, the Social Democratic Party headquarters had almost completely decided on the matter of participating in the National Assembly. When he took the opinions of some party members in the north to Shanghai and then to Nanjing to meet with Zhang Junmai, Chairman Chiang's two-page reply had already arrived. Under these circumstances, everything seemed unchangeable. Before returning to Beiping, Mr. Junmai greatly hoped that the comrades in the north could understand his decision, and stated that he personally would not participate in the National Assembly. When asked by reporters whether the Social Democratic Party would split as a result, Hu did not answer. After Hu returned to Beiping and got off the plane, he first exchanged views with Qiu Shui and others. He will also meet with Zhang Dongsun within a few days. Whether some party members in the north will again express their attitude towards the National Assembly or take action remains to be decided after consultation with Zhang and others.

According to party insiders who hinted to reporters, the list of candidates for Ping was telegraphed to the headquarters last night. Today, the Social Democratic Party will submit the list of National Assembly representatives to Chairman Chiang. It was also reported that Tianjin held a meeting at the same time and appointed Wei Jiqing to report to Nanjing on party affairs and recommend candidates for National Assembly representatives.

### Zhang Junmai's Letter to the Chairman

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] The letter from the Social Democratic Party, signed by Zhang Junmai, to the Chairman, and the Chairman's reply, were officially exchanged on the 23rd. Xu Fulin of the Social Democratic Party announced it at 9:00 PM. The contents of the letter are recorded as follows:

Letter from Zhang Junmai:

Respected Chairman Jieshi: Since participating in the Political Consultative Conference in January of this year, what I have been thinking about is peaceful unification, integrating the various parties in the country into the National Assembly, and formulating a constitution that the whole country abides by. What you, sir, are seeking is no different from this. Who would have thought that things would go awry? The initial union of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party at the PCC would ultimately diverge because the date for the National Assembly could not be agreed upon. I, Junmai, strongly advocated postponing the opening by fifteen days to allow for broader consultations, but I was unable to obtain the understanding of all parties. As a result, the hearts of those who seek peace are filled with anxiety. Many suspect that there will be no day for peace talks between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and although the ceasefire order has been issued, the people still fear that they will not escape the suffering of war. Although the National Assembly can be convened, the constitution that is formulated may be difficult to abide by jointly. The representatives of the PCC will also be divided into two. If these doubts become reality, the country will be in a state of irreversible calamity. However, I, Junmai, believe that although the situation is dangerous, there is still hope for reversal, which lies in your Excellency's careful planning and first exhausting what is within my power: (1) How to thoroughly implement the ceasefire order to prevent the expansion of the war and sincerely strive for the utmost sincerity of peace; (2) How to thoroughly implement the spirit of the PCC resolutions to demonstrate to the people of the country the determination to implement democracy.

Thorough implementation of the ceasefire order requires:

First, the Military Mediation Executive Department presided over by the Three-Person Committee should continue to work actively to avoid the expansion of conflicts and reserve room for the resumption of peace talks.

Second, in accordance with the troop reorganization plan, the government should seek its realization with the greatest forbearance.

Third, the government's repeated statements of resolving political disputes through political means should remain firm and unchanged, so that true peace can be achieved, finances can be reorganized, and national strength can be consolidated.

Thorough implementation of the PCC resolutions requires:

First, the draft constitution revised by the PCC Constitutional Drafting Committee should be passed within the National Assembly, and all parties should be responsible for ensuring its passage.

Second, effectively protect the people's freedom of person, speech, association, and academic freedom, so that the people can freely express the depression in their hearts, and the government can thus know the direction of the people's hearts and be warned.

Third, since the government is determined to implement constitutionalism, it should automatically end party rule at an early date. The following points should be implemented first:

(1) After the constitution is promulgated, the expenses of party departments at all levels should cease to be paid from the national treasury.

(2) After the government is reorganized, the central government already has the National Government Committee as the decision-making body. The administration of provinces, cities, and counties should be the responsibility of the provincial, city, and county governments, and local party departments should not interfere.

(3) Schools are places for cultivating citizens and talents. If young students are allowed to participate in party political work, it will only cause disputes. The government should, based on the way of cultivating talents for the country, clearly stipulate measures to eliminate the suspicion of party-dominated education.

If the government can earnestly implement all of these points, it will naturally cause the people to understand the determination to move towards democracy and create a harmonious atmosphere in the country, which will be of great help to the restoration of peace talks.

Fourth, the reorganization of the government and the cooperation of various parties aims to refresh politics and should be based on the principle of employing people based on their merits, bringing a fresh look to the world. Since the PCC, it seems that the various parties have been arguing over the number of seats in the National Government and the responsibilities of the ministries of the Executive Yuan. However, in essence, what is urgently needed is the renewal of the entire spirit of the administration and the talent regardless of boundaries. If people of Kuomintang nationality control or check each other in various ways in the reorganized government, the administrative organs will become more and more disintegrated and unable to operate. I, Junmai, have already participated in the review work in advance after the PCC, and I am willing to complete the review work. If the draft constitution can be based on the PCC's resolutions, and at the same time the government can anticipate it, and automatically express the end of party rule at an early date, while thoroughly implementing the ceasefire order, and thoroughly implementing the spirit of the PCC resolutions, then the comrades of the Democratic Socialist Party, although deeply regretful that the various parties cannot gather together, will naturally attend on this day of returning power to the people to support the completion of the great law. There is no shortage of people in the country who doubt the effectiveness of the actual implementation of this soon-to-be-completed constitution, but I, Junmai, dare not speculate and stay out of the review. The success or failure of the great cause of nation-building in the future is closely tied to this, and the direction of the people's hearts throughout the country also depends on the effectiveness of the implementation of the constitution. Please consider carefully, and I await your clear instruction. Sincerely, Zhang Junmai, Chairman of the Organization Committee of the China Democratic Socialist Party. November 20, 35th year of the Republic of China.

### Chen Lifu Talks Freely About Constitution-Making and Peace Talks

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] Chen Lifu, Minister of the Organization Department, met with reporters on the 23rd and spoke freely about the issue of constitution-making, believing that the five-power system is most suitable for our national conditions. Regarding the issue of peace talks, he believes that when the time is right, reopening is still possible, but the Communist Party's hesitation on peace talks will only cause suffering to the people.

### Chairman's Reply to Zhang Junmai

Reply from President Chiang:

Respected Mr. Junmai:

I have received your letter of November 20th, and I am deeply moved by your loyalty to the country and your concern for the government's aspirations. The purpose of convening the National Assembly this time is to fulfill the lifelong struggle of the National Father and to realize the government's long-cherished wish to end tutelage and return power to the people. This is known to all Chinese people and must be supported by you, sir. I am very pleased to hear that your party intends to participate immediately. The points indicated in the letter have either been handled by the government or are being implemented by the government. They are all insightful and coincide with the government's ideas. Regarding the issue of the Chinese Communist Party, the government has always been determined to find a solution through political methods. This ceasefire order must be thoroughly implemented, the executive group should continue to be effective, and the troop reorganization plan should be realized in order to achieve the goal of nationalization of the army. Since the PCC draft constitution has been agreed upon, all parties should be responsible for finding ways to pass it. The government has promulgated and implemented measures to protect the people's freedom, and should strive to implement them one by one in the future.

As for the end of party rule mentioned in the letter, our party has already made a decision and is gradually implementing it. After the constitution is promulgated, it should be completed as soon as possible, as stated in the letter.

Regarding the reorganization of the government, we must concentrate talents from all parties and improve administrative efficiency in political issues so that the work of nation-building can be promoted rapidly. In short, the points listed in the letter are what the government should do and what Zhongzheng personally wants to do his best to achieve. You, sir, have always advocated the early implementation of constitutionalism. This convocation of the National Assembly is to formulate a constitution so that our party can end party rule and return power to the people, which is also what you, sir, desire. Therefore, I hope that members of your party will attend this National Assembly and jointly participate in the constitution-making work so that constitutionalism can be implemented at an early date. Then all of your political and propositions can be easily solved. I hope that your party, people from all parties, and social elites will uphold the spirit of sincere unity and common effort to overcome national difficulties at the beginning of the War of Resistance, and work together with our party to promote the completion of the great cause of nation-building. The future of the country depends on it! I hereby send this reply and wish you all the best! Chiang Kai-shek, President of the Chinese Nationalist Party. November 21, 35th year of the Republic of China. (Investigation)

### Zhang Junmai Issues a Statement Declaring That He Personally Does Not Intend to Participate in the National Assembly, but Is Willing to Contribute His Opinion on Constitution-Making

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] Zhang Junmai, the leader of the Democratic Socialist Party, recently issued a statement saying: "The documents exchanged between the Democratic Socialist Party and the Kuomintang this time are purely based on the needs of the country and the people. Chairman Chiang's reply is a major expression before the implementation of constitutionalism. The comrades of our party are participating in the National Assembly in this spirit to support the completion of the great law. As for myself, Junmai, I have always been devoted to political thought and academic research. Therefore, when various parties in Chongqing discussed and proposed the list of National Assembly members, I repeatedly stated that I did not want to assume any title. As for the discussion of the draft constitution, whether any party needs Junmai's explanation or participation in opinions, I am happy to comply."

### Documents Related to the Ports of Dalian and Lushun Are Currently Being Studied by the Chairman and Foreign Minister Wang

[United Press, Nanjing, 23rd] A reliable source in the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs told a United Press reporter today that Chairman Chiang and Foreign Minister Wang Shijie are currently studying all documents related to the ports of Dalian and Lushun in order to determine the government's course of action. These people said that as of now, the Chairman has not made any decision. "Some parties" have urged direct negotiations with the Soviet Union to discuss the handover. It is said that the Chairman is unwilling to take any action that might alienate the Soviet Union, and such action would be unwise at a time when relations between the government and the Communist Party have reversed.

[United Press, Beiping, 23rd] Reports from Changchun say that the Chinese Communists who took over Dalian from the Soviets have declared martial law in the port.

### Marshall Arrives in Tianjin

When the three special planes landed at the airport, only Marshal Marshall was in a single plane, and he was warmly welcomed. Mrs. Marshall and her entourage remained in the plane and did not come out. Marshal Marshall was relaxed and at ease. After getting off the plane, he drove to the US military camp to watch the American football game and did not meet with reporters. Mrs. Marshall flew to Beiping on the original plane.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 23rd] Marshal Marshall took a special plane on the 23rd at 1:00 PM, and there was a telegram ordering Sun Lianzhong to take care of the reception.

It is generally speculated that Mrs. Marshall's visit to Ping will be a prelude to Marshal Marshall's visit to Ping. In a day or two, Marshal Marshall may come to Ping to inspect the Military Mediation Department and return to Nanjing with his wife.

### Wang Yaowu Arrives in Nanjing; Du Yuming Visits the Chairman

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] Lu Chairman Wang Yaowu arrived in Nanjing by special plane from Ji'nan at 4:30 PM on the 23rd for official business.

### Marshall and Stuart Are Willing to Make a Trip to Yan'an to Seek Peace in Our Country; the Communist Party's Attitude Can Be Decided Within a Week

[United Press, Nanjing, 23rd] It was learned from reliable sources this morning that the Central Committee of the Communist Party in Yan'an will decide within a week whether the Communist Party will accept the government's peace plan or retreat into a small area in western China to conduct a protracted war. At the same time, the future fate of General Marshall, the mediator in China, is also in the hands of Yan'an. It is expected that Yan'an will issue a statement in the next few days clarifying whether the US President's special envoy is still acceptable to the Communist Party. If the Communist Party Central Committee hopes so, it is believed that General Marshall and Ambassador Stuart will be willing to fly to Yan'an to seek a peaceful solution. At the same time, Zhou Enlai, the chief representative of the Communist Party's peace talks, is reporting to the Communist Party Central Committee on the Nanjing negotiations, deciding whether the Communist Party will maintain its recent tough attitude and refuse Chairman Chiang's ceasefire proposal, or whether they are willing to achieve readily available peace. A senior government official told a United Press reporter today that if the Communist Party can also issue a ceasefire order and reconvene the Three-Person Committee to determine the permanent allocation of military districts, then the civil war "can be ended almost immediately." If the Communist Party does not accept the peace proposal, the government will regard the Communist Party's attitude as open rebellion against the government. He said that Chairman Chiang's attitude seems to have been greatly eased, because in terms of amendments to the draft constitution and the reorganization of the government, he has adhered to the principles set at the conference of various parties in January. However, the Communist Party has refused to retreat a step, and said that this ability of the Communist Party may only be a political posture, but in the National Assembly and the soon-to-be-reorganized National Government Committee and the Executive Yuan, positions are reserved for the Communist Party, waiting for them to take their seats, which is a fact.

Regarding this matter, the Chinese Consul in Hanoi has formally protested to the French Commissioner in Vietnam. Furthermore, Annamese troops attacked the Chinese Consulate, and a Chinese woman was shot and killed. The Chinese side has also lodged a protest. The protest was issued to the French representative because the Chinese government has not yet recognized the Annamese Republic (also known as the Viet Minh Republic) led by Ho Chi Minh.

### Philippines Oppresses Overseas Chinese Merchants; Illegally Confiscates Sugar and Will Adopt Strict Measures; Chinese Legation Submits Memorandum and Lodges Serious Protest

[Central News Agency, Manila, 22nd] Personnel from the Philippine Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (PRRA) are currently proposing to take strict measures against a large number of Chinese merchants here, potentially deporting them. These measures are related to the sugar storage case currently under consideration by Malacañang Palace. It is reported that the PRRA has sealed 24,550 bags of refined sugar, of which more than 18,000 bags are stored in the warehouses of import companies because the PRRA's warehouses cannot accommodate them. Of these 18,000 bags, thousands belong to Chinese importers, who, under the orders of the Philippine government, inventoried all the stored sugar as "goods of the import companies" and stored them in their own warehouses. People from Malacañang Palace report that Chinese merchants began selling them on the market. The PRRA received instructions and immediately dispatched search teams to suspected shops, discovering more than 4,000 bags. It is said that Chinese merchants disposed of 4,444 bags of sugar without the permission of the Philippine government, accounting for 18 percent of the stored sugar in the import companies. Our merchants are currently seeking legal remedies, as the law stipulates that the government's price limit for sugar is one peso per kilogram. If merchants can provide receipts proving that they paid 1.21 pesos per kilogram of sugar, they can receive fair compensation. Our legation recently accepted the suggestion of Philippine Presidential Secretary Abello, submitting a memorandum to the Philippine government regarding the overall confiscation situation and protesting the high-handed measures taken during the confiscation.

Furthermore, according to a report in a local newspaper, France's initiation of negotiations with China is illegal because France has already recognized the sovereignty of the Viet Minh government.

It is generally estimated that the total cost will be more than 10 billion yuan in national currency, and the time required will be at least two years. The materials and services provided by the U.S. side will be treated as loans and not as investments.

### Commander of Puppet 2nd Army, Xu Pucheng, Accused of Killing Patriots During the War of Resistance

[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 23rd] Xu Pucheng, commander of the puppet 2nd Army, was fortunate enough to be pardoned by the authorities after the victory, and has been living freely ever since. He has now been accused by Zhang Shaohua, commander of the 2nd Brigade of the Jiangsu Provincial Water Police, to the local authorities for killing patriots. The reason being that in 1944, Zhang dispatched his subordinates Wang Guojun and eight others to Changzhou to carry out underground work. Xu discovered this, and his troops cruelly murdered them one by one. There is no greater injustice in the world than this. The families have been filled with anger ever since, and all they want is to take revenge.

### Ten Legislators Discuss Revising the Draft Constitution (II)

— Our Reporter Yu Zhenji

One of the main differences between the revised draft and the original draft is that the original draft stipulated the rights and obligations of the people as follows: "The people have ×× freedom, which shall not be restricted except by law." The revised draft changed this to "The people have ×× freedom," and removed "which shall not be restricted except by law." This is a modification based on the principles of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC). (The PCC made the following provisions regarding the rights and obligations of the people: (1) All freedoms and interests that democratic people should enjoy shall be protected by the Constitution and shall not be illegally infringed; (2) If there are legal provisions regarding the freedoms of the people, they must be based on the spirit of protecting freedom, and not for the purpose of restriction.)

Wang Xianhui, the drafter of the revised draft, stated when he attended the Legislative Yuan on the 13th of this month to explain the collation process: The revised draft and the original draft have the same purpose, only differing in starting points. The legislators were quite satisfied with this and considered it a progressive provision. Mr. Chen Guyuan believes that the provisions of the May 5th Draft Constitution were too trivial. He also questioned whether the people's freedom of belief should be included in the Constitution, as the constitutions of various countries do not have such provisions. He believes that the freedoms listed in the revised draft are inherent human rights, but they are not without restrictions. For example, Article 23 stipulates: "All other freedoms and rights of the people that do not harm social order or public interests shall be protected by the Constitution," providing the people with active protection. Zhong Tianxin also believes that the revised draft is superior to the original draft.

The only person who believed that this article was inferior to the original draft was Fu Tongxian. Mr. Fu is a logician who expressed his unique views at the Legislative Yuan’s discussion meeting with a non-partisan and non-factional point of view. Mr. Fu believes that the original draft Constitution does not imply "legal restrictions." The first sentence, "The people have ×× freedom," is active, and its object is the people. The Constitution grants the people the protection of freedom based on this sentence. The second sentence, "which shall not be restricted except by law," is passive, and its object is the government. The Constitution binds the government based on this sentence. This provision is actually superior to the revised draft.

Mr. Fu further explained based on logic, saying: "which shall not be restricted except by law" does not equal "which may be restricted by law." He gave the example: "If it is not restricted according to law, then it cannot be restricted," which can be changed to "If this flower has no color, it is definitely not red." These two statements commit the error of "conversion" (a logical fallacy) in logic by negating the subject. The error of those who generally believe that the original May 5th Constitution contains legal restrictions lies in this. At the same time, if the law referred to in "which shall not be restricted except by law" violates the constitutional principle of protecting the rights of the people, this law cannot restrict the freedom of the people. In other words, even if the government restricts the freedom of the people, it must be within the scope of the Constitution, so there seems to be no need to worry. However, can a law that conforms to the Constitution restrict individual freedom? Mr. Fu believes that since the Constitution was formulated by the representatives of the people, that is, formulated by the people themselves, it can restrict the freedom of the people.

The Organization and Powers of the National Assembly

Regarding the organization and powers of the National Assembly, the revised draft differs significantly from the May 5th Draft Constitution. Due to this difference, the relationship between the National Assembly and the Legislative Yuan also differs greatly. According to the May 5th Draft Constitution, the National Assembly representatives were directly elected by the counties and cities, Mongolia, Tibet, and Overseas Chinese. The revised draft adds two items: (1) Legislators directly elected by the provinces, regions, Tibet, Mongolia, and counties; (2) Censors elected by the provincial assemblies and the leagues of Mongolia and the local assembly of Tibet.

Mr. Chen Changheng believes that after adding the above two items, the total number of National Assembly representatives may increase to about 4,000 people. With the increase in the number of people, holding meetings will be more difficult.

Secondly, Mr. Chen believes that according to the revised draft, the National Assembly representatives are re-elected every six years. Although the Censors are also elected every six years, their election does not coincide with that of the National Assembly representatives. The term of legislators is only three years. In other words, legislators who serve as National Assembly representatives must be elected twice during one National Assembly period. In addition, the election of the President and the election of the legislators and Censors do not coincide either. Furthermore, according to the clauses, the legislators and Censors are created first, followed by the National Assembly, and their re-election must take place before the re-election of the National Assembly. Due to the order of the election periods, various malpractices will arise. Friction will easily occur between the two houses, and between the President and the Legislative Yuan.

Regarding the addition of legislators and Censors to the National Assembly representatives, Mr. Wang Chonghui said when reporting on the collation process of the draft Constitution in the Legislative Yuan, that this would increase the contact between the two houses and the National Assembly. Mr. Li Qingxiang also believes that this is an advantage of the revised draft, because if the National Assembly has the provisions of a resident committee (the first draft of the 1934 Constitution stipulated that a National Committee be established during the adjournment period of the National Assembly. The May 5th Draft Constitution deleted this provision, and so does the revised draft), it will easily conflict with the Legislative Yuan and will also have the drawback of being redundant with the Control Yuan. Mr. Li believes that after the legislators serve as representatives of the National Assembly, the Legislative Yuan, in some respects, is equivalent to the resident committee of the National Assembly. During the recess of the National Assembly, legislators, who are more knowledgeable about the law and are often in the capital, can supervise the government and formulate laws based on general legal trends and the current political situation. They can also request a temporary meeting of the National Assembly when necessary. All of these are progressive aspects of the revised draft. Mr. Fu Tongxian also raised similar opinions on how to express the will of the people after the National Assembly adjourns.

According to the May 5th Draft Constitution, the Censors and legislators were originally elected by the National Assembly. According to the revised draft, the Censors are elected by the provincial and municipal assemblies, and the legislators are directly elected by the people. There is a change in the method of production. Zhong Tianxin believes that this change cannot be said to reduce the independence of the legislators and Censors, but rather increases their independence. Chen Guyuan also believes that the legislators and Censors, who are directly or indirectly elected by the people to serve as National Assembly representatives, are more direct than in the original Constitution.

Regarding the powers of the National Assembly, according to the original Constitution, the National Assembly had six types of powers, namely the power to elect the President and Vice President, the President and Vice President of the Legislative Yuan,

### Editorial: The Issue of Foreign Troop Deployment!

Since the United Nations General Assembly addressed the issue of international disarmament proposed by the Soviet representative, Foreign Minister Molotov again raised the issue of foreign troop deployment at the UN General Assembly Political Committee yesterday. According to the Soviet view, the stationing of foreign troops in the territory of non-enemy countries is a way of interfering in their internal affairs, and therefore the Allied forces should not be stationed in Allied countries. Molotov then proposed that the UN General Assembly request the Security Council to ask member states to submit the following reports within one month: (1) Where and how many troops are stationed by member states in the territory of non-enemy countries; (2) Where and how many troops are stationed by member states in the territory of former enemy countries; Where are the bases and naval defense positions established by member states before and most recently. Molotov continued, "There are still a small number of Soviet troops in Poland, which are used to maintain transportation routes to Germany. As for the Soviet troops in northern Korea, they are stationed there according to agreements with the Allied countries. In contrast, the British and American troops are still stationed in various parts of Europe, Asia and South America long after the war has ended, and their air force bases are even more densely distributed around the world, and some countries feel particularly interested in the two poles. The Soviet government submitted a report to the Security Council in August regarding the stationing of troops in non-enemy countries. The Soviet Union is willing to fulfill this obligation and hopes that other countries will also agree to seek the common interests of the world.

The presentation of this issue aroused the indignation of the American representative Connally, who further stated: "The investigation of troop deployments should include all the troops in the world. Soldiers carrying bayonets, whether on their own land or on foreign land, constitute a threat to peace." Seeing this situation, the British representative had to propose a compromise solution, believing that the suggestions made by the Soviet representative, limited only to armed forces stationed abroad, were insufficient, and advocated the establishment of a staff committee to collect all information on this issue. How this proposal will develop remains to be seen in the future; however, the re-emergence of the issue of foreign troop deployment, and the tone of the Soviet representative, between the lines, fully revealed anti-British and anti-American sentiments amidst calmness, which aroused the emotions of the American representative and led to sharp words. It cannot be said that the presentation of this issue is another naked manifestation of the struggle between the Soviet Union and the United States. Molotov even clearly pointed out that there was no reason for the US military to be stationed in China. This reminds us of the proposal made by the Ukrainian representative at the UN General Assembly a month ago to demand the withdrawal of US troops from China, which echoed each other before and after, which is quite intriguing.

Since this issue of foreign troop deployment involves China, our country cannot remain silent. Mr. Gu Weijun, the Chinese representative attending the United Nations General Assembly, made some indications at yesterday's meeting. In addition to agreeing with the American amendment, that is, the investigation of troop deployments should not distinguish between domestic and foreign, and member states of the United Nations organizations should announce the number of their troops at home and abroad, he also sternly stated that the US military in China has "caused friction." In addition to endorsing the statement of our representative, we would also like to express our views on the issue of foreign troop deployment.

First, we endorse the Soviet representative's suggestion that the troops stationed by various countries in foreign countries should be investigated, and there is a need to exchange information; but we believe that foreign troop deployments should not be separated from domestic troop deployments, but should be investigated together. Although there is a distinction between domestic and foreign troop deployments, a country's armed forces are a whole; ignoring domestic troop deployments cannot give a clear understanding of foreign troop deployments. What threatens world peace is not only foreign troop deployments, but the sum total of a country's military strength. Therefore, we believe that foreign troop deployments should be investigated, and domestic troop deployments should also be investigated, so that the total strength of a country's military can be clearly understood to see whether it is sufficient to threaten world peace.

Second, we oppose foreign troops interfering in the internal affairs of the host country; but we must understand the difference in the nature of foreign troops. The rule of occupying forces in a defeated country, of course, cannot be said to be foreign troops interfering in internal affairs. Second, since the present world is still centered on national sovereignty, it is the normal exercise of a country's sovereignty for one country to invite the troops of another country to be stationed in its territory. As long as both parties are acting out of free will, this behavior is not enough to constitute an issue that would warrant international discussion, unless this behavior does threaten world peace. If a country sends troops without the consent or invitation of the host country, its behavior is tantamount to aggression and should naturally be intolerable to peace-loving nations. Therefore, we believe that the general statement that Allied forces should not be stationed in Allied countries must be conditional. Otherwise, it is tantamount to restricting the legitimate exercise of a country's sovereignty.

Third, the key to domestic and foreign troop deployments is not only investigation, but also whether they will be reduced after the investigation. Therefore, the issue of troop deployment investigation is actually part of the issue of disarmament. Therefore, we agree with the statement of British Foreign Secretary Bevin: "The investigation of foreign troop deployments and the reduction of armaments are actually one thing" and should be discussed together. If we only talk about the investigation of foreign troop deployments without talking about the investigation of domestic troop deployments, we have not grasped the whole issue; if we only talk about the investigation of domestic and foreign troop deployments without talking about the reduction of armaments, we have not grasped the whole issue. Therefore, foreign troop deployments and disarmament are actually one thing and cannot be separated.

Speaking of the US military stationed in China, it was with the consent of our government and did not interfere in China's internal affairs; it was a legitimate and free exercise of China's sovereignty and should not have been regarded as an issue and submitted for international discussion. Moreover, the number of US troops stationed in China is very small and is not sufficient to threaten world peace. Although the Soviet army has now withdrawn from several major cities in Northeast China, the actual situation of the Soviet army in the Northeast is not well known to the world. Moreover, its withdrawal often does not follow proper channels to be taken over by our government. It is really laughable for the Soviet Union to raise the issue of foreign troop deployment. We hope that there can be less friction in the international community so that there can be sincere cooperation among nations; only in this way can world peace be lasting.

[Report from Wuhu by This Newspaper] Cases of bandits killing and robbing goods have occurred continuously in the water and land transportation in Wuhu and nearby areas, dozens of times, and security has been lost.

Especially in the eastern townships, gambling tables are set up at every market, and the stationed police turn a blind eye, or even stand at the corners of the tables as if they are protecting the gambling. Farmers are ignorant and believe that gambling is allowed in public, so more people join in the gambling.

### An Urgent Proposal for Clearing Out Temporary Coffin Storage

Recently, after reading the regulations issued by the Health Bureau regarding the clearing of temporary coffin storage, I deeply felt the need for improvement. Therefore, I do not hesitate to offer a humble opinion for the authorities to consider.

(1) Those involved in temporary coffin storage have scattered to the four winds during this long war of resistance. In most cases, they cannot remain in a fixed location. Some have lost their homes and jobs, while others have become disabled or died. These are unavoidable realities. If the authorities wish to clear the storage thoroughly, it would be best if the Health Bureau notified the various provincial and county associations in Shanghai to take charge of the matter. At the same time, funeral parlors and temporary coffin storage facilities should provide detailed reports of the names, origins, and addresses of those who have stored coffins, compiled by province and county, and forwarded to the respective provincial associations in Shanghai for handling. This would ensure widespread awareness and prevent situations where no one comes forward to take care of the matter. (2) After the funeral parlors, etc., have reported the circumstances of those who have stored coffins, the relevant provincial associations should negotiate transportation methods and set the amount of fees, but they should be proportionate to the distance to determine the amount of fees, so that depositors can pay according to regulations. If it is found that some are indeed poor and unable to cope, the associations should prepare a list and apply to the Health Bureau for financial assistance or appeal to enthusiastic philanthropists for more relief. If the gentlemen involved in coffin storage sympathize with the above humble opinion, I hope that there will be more concrete measures to promote its realization, to comfort the spirits of the deceased in foreign lands.

### Identifying War Criminals - Do Not Allow Anyone to Slip Through the Net

Your newspaper published an article on the 18th of this month entitled "Atrocities are Forgotten in Leniency, Torturers are Returning Home." We are grateful for this great spirit, which is like a surge of heat reminding the hearts of all Chinese compatriots. Those who have suffered all kinds of torture under the iron hooves of the enemy without yielding, and the martyred heroes who have been loyal to their duties, may have another chance to seek justice and revenge. On behalf of the wounded and dead soldiers and civilians, we put forward a few requests: (1) We hope that the head of the War Criminals Management Office will approve another general identification. (2) The identification time is too short. The comrades who suffered in remote areas cannot identify them due to transportation, travel expenses, and other difficulties. The War Criminals Management Office should disclose the information several days in advance so that the comrades who have suffered all kinds of hardships in remote areas can also come to seek revenge. (3) If the victim's family only knows the name of the murderer but does not know the person, we hope that the management authorities will do their best to help with the inspection to prevent anyone from slipping through the net. (4) We hope that the government authorities will do their best to arrange for the families of the martyred comrades and heroes to comfort the loyal souls. (Zhang Huizhong)

### Tensions Rise Again Over the Dardanelles Strait - US Fleet Visits Turkey for the Second Time - Washington Denies Large Numbers of US Troops Will Go to Greece

[Agence France-Presse, Smyrna, 23rd] The US fleet patrolling the Mediterranean entered Turkish territorial waters at 10 pm last night and entered this port at 7:30 am this morning. The fleet includes the 27,000-ton aircraft carrier "Randolph," the cruiser "Fargo," and several escort ships. The authorities of ten countries here warmly welcomed the US fleet. Political observers believe that the US fleet's visit is of great significance amid the renewed tension over the Dardanelles Strait. It is recalled that the US battleship "Missouri" visited Istanbul, Turkey on March 1st this year, at a time when Soviet-Turkish relations were tense. This time, the US fleet will stay for three days, then sail to the small port of Marmaris south of here. After leaving Turkish territorial waters, the fleet will visit Lebanon, and then return to Greece.

[United Press, London, 22nd] A Foreign Office spokesman told the press today: After the revision of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936, Britain hopes that Egypt will be solely responsible for the defense of the Suez Canal. Britain's attitude towards the management of the Dardanelles Strait is consistent with its policy towards the Suez Canal. The status of both the strait and the canal is stipulated by international agreements as international waterways, and Britain believes that the original state should be maintained.

[United Press, Athens, 22nd] The right-wing newspaper "Vradyni" today carried a special dispatch from Salonika stating: According to authoritative sources, 18,000 US troops will arrive in Salonika at the beginning of next month, and everything is being arranged there. However, Colonel Walkeritz, the US military attache in Athens, did not comment on this news.

[United Press, Washington, 22nd] According to a dispatch from Athens, 18,000 US troops will arrive in Salonika, Greece next month. The US Department of the Army denounced it as nonsense, and State Department officials also denied knowing of this plan.

### Demanding Reports on Overseas Troops - Soviet Union Ridicules Britain's Attempt to Evade - Molotov Reiterates That It Cannot Be Compared with the Disarmament Proposal

[Reuters, Lake Success, 22nd] Molotov addressed the Political Committee of the UN General Assembly today, opposing the British delegation's proposal to discuss the investigation of foreign troops at the same time as the disarmament proposal. He reiterated that the Soviet Union was willing to provide information on its domestic troops, but said that this issue should be related to the disarmament issue. He pointed out that the issue of foreign troops itself is a major issue, while universal disarmament is an even more important matter. If the two matters are discussed together, one will inevitably lose sight of the other. Although there is no refusal of the investigation of foreign troops, there are attempts to evade it. It must be known that any evasive answer is harmful rather than beneficial. I hope that all members can unanimously support this proposal. Strong countries should regard this as their responsibility, and small countries can also obtain guarantees as a result.

The French representative, Parodi, declared that he would support the Soviet proposal, but felt that this matter could not be discussed at the same time as the disarmament proposal, pointing out that the specific parts of the Soviet proposal could not be buried in the larger disarmament issue. Upon hearing this, the British representative, Bevin, immediately stood up and stated that the British delegation had no intention of concealing any part of the Soviet proposal, but only wished to discuss the two matters at the same time. He believed that the French representative's page was actually equivalent to supporting the British proposal.

Molotov spoke for as long as 50 minutes. He particularly pointed out the matter of British troops stationed in Greece, saying that in peacetime, the stationing of a large army of a strong country in the territory of a small country would naturally cause psychological anxiety. The stationing of troops directly affects the interests, security, independence, and freedom of various countries, so there is sufficient reason to discuss it. Although the war has ended and the environment has changed, the issue of stationing troops is still a major issue. There is no reason for the stationing of troops in other UN member states. If the troop-stationing country believes it is reasonable, it should offer an explanation. Now that the military need has disappeared, the stationing of foreign troops has caused extreme unease in world opinion. Previously, many disputes arose in the Security Council due to the stationing of Soviet troops in Iran, but at that time the Soviet government announced the reasons for its delayed withdrawal from Iran. The Soviet Union has fulfilled its obligations to Iran. Now we still do not know whether other foreign troops in Iran have been withdrawn. In fact, no one can know the exact situation there, but we should assume that the foreign troops there have been completely withdrawn. Molotov continued, the stationing of foreign troops in Greece, no one can deny that it is exerting pressure on the domestic political situation there. In addition, there are the matters of the United States and Iceland due to the stationing of troops, etc. In short, the issue of stationing troops is a major issue among international countries. This is why the Soviet representative country can strongly advocate disclosure.

British and American Reactions

[United Press, Lake Success, 22nd] The US representative, Connally, told reporters afterwards that the United States can provide detailed reports on the number of domestic and foreign troops at any time in accordance with the resolution of the General Assembly. The British delegation said that Mr. Molotov's tone was moderate, but unfortunately it was not consistent with his speech on Wednesday. In addition, it is learned that Mr. Connally and the British representative, Noel-Baker, will respond to Molotov at tomorrow's meeting. The United States also intends to propose a compromise plan between the issue of reporting on foreign troops and the issue of disarmament, so as to reconcile the positions of Britain and the Soviet Union. The content has not yet been published. However, it is learned that the United States believes that the issue of troop reporting is of secondary nature compared to the issue of disarmament. The proposals of Britain and the Soviet Union are expected to be submitted to the Political Committee for a vote today.

### US Coal Miners' Return to Work Hopeless - Lewis' Attitude Firm - Government Orders Nationwide Power Conservation

[United Press, Washington, 22nd] The Department of the Navy, together with other relevant government agencies, also came forward today to deal with the coal miners' strike led by Lewis, the chairman of the Miners' Union. In order to remedy the cessation of bituminous coal production, the department has ordered the commanders of various military districts to rent out surplus naval generators to the private sector to maintain public use, and to sell surplus naval bituminous coal and electricity when absolutely necessary. Lewis remained silent, outwardly calm, and has accepted the court's subpoena for contempt of court, thus formally confronting the government. Lewis is determined to fight for a legal strike, as seen in the continued strike of 400,000 miners, who only need one word from Lewis to resume work. Lewis' acceptance of the legal challenge has dashed hopes of resuming work before the 25th. The government is proceeding with a fuel storage plan and intends to order a ban on all freight transport, except for essential goods; but the Department of National Defense Transportation announced that it will have to wait a few days to implement it to observe developments. The court subpoena ordered Lewis to explain why he and the United Mine Workers Union should not be punished. Lewis can avoid punishment if he orders the miners to resume work before the 25th, otherwise he will be tried on the morning of the 27th.

[Also from Washington] The US government is deeply afraid that the coal miners' strike will be prolonged and that power plants will run out of fuel. It has ordered 21 states and the capital to implement power conservation starting on the 25th, reducing advertising and shop window lighting, reducing department store elevators by a quarter, and canceling all decorative lighting. Civil Production Management Committee Member Smal warned that the lack of coal will devastate the national economy and suffer major difficulties.

[Remodeling Company, Tokyo, 23rd] Regarding the issue of eliminating the Zaibatsu, the Japanese government has designated Zaibatsu-related companies as "restricted companies" since December, based on the directive issued by the Allied Headquarters on November 6 last year, and restricted the dissolution of these companies, changes in capital, and the movement of major assets. It has now been decided to expand the application of the restriction to the subsidiaries and sub-subsidiaries of the Zaibatsu companies, and an imperial edict will be promulgated on the 25th and implemented immediately. The edict stipulates that these restricted companies are prohibited from holding shares in other companies, and also stipulates that the employees of these companies may not hold any positions in other companies. These companies may not enter into contracts with other companies that restrict freedom of trade and competition, and contracts that attempt to control these non-restricted companies. The purpose of the regulations is to eliminate the behavior of restricted companies directly or indirectly using their subsidiaries and sub-subsidiaries to control the economic world.

[Also from Tokyo] The measures taken by the Japanese government in the past to dismember the Zaibatsu were like using an iceberg to describe the Zaibatsu, only reaching the part that emerged from the water, while this measure is implemented on the larger part that is submerged under the water. The special connections between the holding company (Zaibatsu company) and its subsidiaries and sub-subsidiaries in terms of capital, personnel, and contracts are completely severed. If it can be thoroughly implemented, the elimination of the Zaibatsu can be achieved as scheduled. The number of restricted companies (parent companies) designated by this edict reaches 1,180.

[Agence France-Presse, 22nd] At the request of the Soviet representative, the Allied Control Council for Japan will hold its 20th meeting on the 27th of this month to discuss the issue of cleaning up the Japanese Zaibatsu and the progress made in the cleanup work. Another issue on the agenda is that there are still dozens of members of the Japanese Diet who need to be purged.

### Today's Order: Closure of Three Pro-Japanese Organizations

[Special dispatch from the Central News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd] The Japanese government today ordered the closure of three organizations established specifically for the development of China's rich resources, including the Manchuria Telegraph and Telephone Company, the Manchuria Electric Industry Company, and the North China Transportation Company. These three companies belong to the category of wartime investment banks, which were ordered to be closed by the Allied Headquarters in September.

### US and Korean Officials Fly to China Yesterday to Seek Revival of Sino-Korean Trade

[Dispatch from the United Press, Seoul, 23rd] The U.S. military government announced today that four Koreans and one U.S. official flew to China today to assist in the revival of Sino-Korean trade. It is said that Sino-Korean trade has been interrupted for a long time due to transportation difficulties and lack of information. The trade mission is particularly interested in exchanging Korean apples and seafood for Chinese silk, coal, paper, machinery, medicine, and grain.

### United States Purchases China's Antimony Production

[Special dispatch from the Central News Agency, Washington, 22nd] "World Report" magazine recently published an article stating that due to the high price of antimony, the United States will purchase all of China's potential antimony exports. The supply of antimony is extremely scarce. The United Kingdom will purchase antimony from Bolivia at a high price, and continental European countries will receive none this month.

### Japanese Silk Supplies to the US Market

[Special dispatch from the Central News Agency, Washington, 22nd] The US Reconstruction Finance Corporation announced that its subsidiary, the US Commercial Company, has sold 235,000 yards of bleached Japanese silk fabrics. Japanese dry cocoons will also be supplied to the US market in the short term, with Japanese production peacefully entering the US market.

### Argentina and the Soviet Union Restore Diplomatic Relations

[Combined dispatch from the Central News Agency, Buenos Aires, 22nd] Argentine Ambassador to Moscow, Gandoni, is scheduled to establish an embassy in Moscow in December, marking Argentina's first diplomatic representative to the Soviet Union since the Soviet Revolution in 1917.

### British Labour Party "Rebel" Faction Leader Speaks: Labour Governance is Superior to Churchill's Government; Opposes Anglo-American Armaments Standardization Plan

[Dispatch from the Associated Press, London, 22nd] Labour MP Crossman, leader of the faction opposing the current British foreign policy, declared today that the Anglo-American armaments standardization plan will make Britain an American aircraft carrier off the coast of Europe. He believes that Britain should either conclude military agreements with both the United States and the Soviet Union, or not conclude any at all.

[Dispatch from Reuters, London, 22nd] Crossman, the leader of the Labour "rebel" MPs who proposed an amendment to foreign policy, delivered another speech here today, stating that his criticism of the government only selects points that deserve criticism, and there is absolutely no excess or injustice, because the Labour government is ultimately better than when Churchill was in power. If today's government were led by Churchill, India would be in a state of war, and the rift between Western countries and the Soviet Union would be irreparable.

He continued: The Soviet Union's expansion in Eastern Europe and Iran should be stopped, but the economic imperialist policy adopted by the United States in the Far East should also be resisted. Has Japan not become a colony of the United States today? A socialist Britain should represent the world in resisting imperialism, regardless of whether this imperialism is left-leaning or right-leaning, American or Russian. We cannot agree with what the Americans call "free trade." The United States wants to take advantage of "free trade" to control the world market and destroy the interests of others; the United States also uses loans to exert political pressure. If we are solely linked with the United States or the Soviet Union, our strength will inevitably weaken. Only by maintaining independence and cooperating with both sides, speaking for the people of the world, can we maintain our strength.

### The Five Powers Resumed Meetings Yesterday to Discuss Limiting the Veto Power; The Trieste Issue Awaits Negotiation by the Four Foreign Ministers

[Special dispatch from our New York correspondent, 23rd] At 3:30 PM today, the Five Powers will deal with the veto issue based on the Anglo-American plan, in order to reduce the number of times the veto is used, so as to avoid new demands from other countries to amend the United Nations Charter. The four foreign ministers will meet at 5:00 PM in the afternoon to reach a certain agreement on the Trieste issue based on the principle of mutual concessions. However, Byrnes and Bevin do not seem willing to make many modifications to the plan passed by the Paris Peace Conference. As for the issue of foreign troops stationed abroad, the Soviet Union seems to be able to obtain partial satisfaction, and the number of American troops in Europe will gradually decrease.

[Dispatch from the Associated Press, New York, 22nd] The Four Foreign Ministers' Conference is expected to find a compromise solution to the Soviet Union's firm demand for the periodic withdrawal of troops stationed in Trieste. It is said that the United States has proposed reducing the occupying forces in the international zone to the minimum necessary to maintain law and order, which should lead to a compromise. The center of the dispute lies in mutual fear of how the other party will use the veto power. If the Soviet Union wins, it can prevent the return of withdrawn troops in the event of future disturbances in Trieste. Conversely, if the power to stipulate the deadline for troop withdrawal is granted to the Security Council, as advocated by Western countries, any country can prevent troop withdrawal indefinitely. According to participants in the discussion, the second of the two issues that are still deadlocked is less difficult. It is only focused on the Soviet Union's demand for Yugoslavia to participate in the management rights of the Trieste railway. Molotov has already conceded, abandoning the Trieste-Yugoslav customs union request.

### Indian Congress Party Demands That the Muslim League Withdraw from the Government; Newly Appointed Chairman Urges People to Work Hard for the Country

[Report from our newspaper] London, 23rd broadcast: The newly appointed chairman of the Indian Congress Party, Kriplani, delivered a speech today, saying that freedom is in sight, and urging the Indian people to step up their efforts. Regarding foreign policy, the new chairman of the Congress emphasized strengthening friendly relations with all countries and hoped to improve relations with the Soviet Union.

[Dispatch from Reuters, Meerut, United Provinces, India, 22nd] The All-India Congress Committee resolved here to ask Nehru, the Deputy Prime Minister of the Indian Interim Government, to request Governor-General Wavell of India to ask the Muslim League personnel to withdraw from the Interim Government, because Muslim League leader Jinnah declared yesterday that the Muslim League would not participate in the Constituent Assembly to be convened on December 9, which is inevitably contrary to the declaration issued by the British delegation on May 16.

[Dispatch from Reuters, New Delhi, 23rd] Nehru accused the Muslim League at the Congress Committee on Thursday of trying to seek British support since joining the Interim Government, which is no different from being an agent of the British King in the Interim Government. The Muslim League member Liakat, the Finance Minister of the Interim Government, issued a statement today, saying that since the Muslim League joined the cabinet, it has never used the Governor-General's powers or requested the British government to interfere in its affairs. He asked Nehru to present concrete facts to prove his words.

### Inauguration Ceremony of President Tu of St. John's University; US Ambassador Attends Especially; Three Thoughtful Remarks on University Construction

[Report from our newspaper] The inauguration ceremony of Dr. Tu Yu-ching, the new president of St. John's University in this city, was held at 4:00 PM yesterday. Ambassador Stuart traveled from Beijing to attend. All faculty, students, and guests attended happily. About 50 academic staff and faculty members were present, all wearing academic gowns of various colors. The ceremony was grand, and the situation can be described as enthusiastic.

After Ambassador Stuart and guests Kong Xiangxi, British Consul-General Davis, and British Consul-General Ogden arrived at the school, they first rested and had tea in the school's social hall. At 4:00 PM, all faculty and guests gathered in front of the office hall, wearing academic regalia, lined up in two rows, and entered the auditorium of Si En Hall in an orderly manner. Ambassador Stuart, wearing a Doctor of Divinity gown, was in the third row from the last, President Xu was in the second row from the last, and Honorary President Bu Fangji and Chairman of the Board Yan Huiqing were in the last row.

The ceremony began with music, the team entered the venue, the stage was filled with flower baskets, and there was a shield and a silver cup on the table, with a school seal wrapped in red silk in the middle. Everyone stood up and sang the national anthem, and Bishop Luo gave a prayer in Mandarin.

Presidents Bu Fangji and Franklin Delivered Speeches in Succession

Dr. Bu Fangji served as chairman, first speaking in Mandarin and then in English, stating briefly: St. John's University went through the most difficult and arduous period during the war. Now that the war has ended, the university is also working hard to move forward. The university has a long history of 67 years. Now the board of directors has hired Dr. Tu Yu-ching as president. Dr. Tu has profound knowledge and rich experience and is the most suitable person. I hope he will work hard for the university and wish him success.

Then Dr. Franklin spoke on behalf of the founders, saying: St. John's graduates in the past have made great achievements in all aspects of society. This not only contributes a lot to China but also does its best for the world. Dr. Tu's appointment as president will definitely be competent, and St. John's will have greater expansion and contribution in the future. I would like to express my congratulations on behalf of the founders.

Stuart's Speech

Amidst warm applause, Ambassador Stuart delivered his Mandarin speech with a heavy tone and a sincere attitude, saying: "I am honored to be invited to participate in the ceremony of my old friend Dr. Tu Yu-ching's inauguration as president of St. John's University. I don't want to use ordinary words to express my congratulations now. I would like to ask you to allow me to speak a few words from a personal standpoint.

More than forty years ago, when I was studying in the United States and came to [laughter from the audience, the ambassador also laughed, showing that he always had China in mind], I began to think about what the best way to express the goodwill of the United States to China was. I was deeply impressed by the success of St. John's University. Later, when I became the president of Yenching University, I always wanted to take St. John's University as a model and encouragement, and try to emulate the example of Dr. Bu Fangji, the old president of St. John's University. At that time, I was especially thinking about how to make Yenching University's contribution to training Chinese youth, based on China's situation at the time, as successful as St. John's University had achieved in its early years.

Therefore, my hope for the new president of this famous institution of higher learning comes from my own experience. I hope that he will continue the great traditional spirit of the university, adapt the university's policies and activities to the changing situation in China, and be able to meet the needs of modern students, and enable their students to cooperate with their chosen careers, just like the early achievements of the university were a standard for other schools.

Three Suggestions

Regarding this point, I can offer three suggestions on how to enable all our Christian universities to serve China most effectively in the current stage of development.

First, the new president of St. John's University is taking office during the most important period in China's long history. Now is the second stage of revolutionary progress, that is, the period of political tutelage, which will enter a true democracy. But if there is no intelligent, patriotic, and courageous citizen who is active and supports or criticizes government affairs according to the needs of the environment, then there can be no clean and effective democratic government. This should be the work of Chinese youth, and this university should encourage, guide, and prepare them for this most important task.

Second, in the world we live in now, mankind must maintain peaceful international relations, otherwise mankind will suffer from war, and future wars will be more terrible and destructive than all the wars in human history. The task of the university should be to develop an international perspective for students, to make them understand the existing world problems, and to develop a new conscience for our common humanity. It will enable them to assist their country in approaching the concept of world harmony that Confucius spoke of. Confucius once said: "All within the four seas are brothers."

Key to Achieving People's Livelihood

Third, and finally, what may be considered the most important point is that these church universities have an unparalleled mission. The truth of this mission is no less than the original intention of establishing the school to promote the gospel. Ultimately, China's political difficulties and obstacles are all moral problems. Promoting the lofty leaders of the Christian faith is very helpful to the people. This point has been recognized by the public. As the Christian creed teaches us, and as Jesus practiced in his life, our service to society and the country should be inspired by love and hope, and remove all selfishness and sensuality. This will have a great influence on Chinese youth, and this influence is also the key to realizing democracy and other progress. This coincides with the Chinese emphasis on moral training and philosophical education. In view of the similarities between the great historical tradition of China and the tradition of St. John's, as well as the serious problems facing China today, I would like to express to President Tu: I firmly believe that he will maintain the original tradition of St. John's and try to adapt to the new needs of China today, and adapting to needs is the purpose of establishing St. John's University.

Yan Huiqing Presided Over the Inauguration Ceremony

Then Dr. Yan Huiqing presided over the inauguration ceremony on behalf of the board of directors, officially granting the name of President of St. John's University and hoping that he would do his best for the university and increase the university's honor.

New President's Reply

Finally, the new president, Dr. Tu, gave a reply, saying that he has shallow knowledge and does not dare to take on the heavy responsibility of this university with a glorious history of 67 years, but with the urging of all the directors, the cooperation of teachers and students, and the encouragement of friends, he is determined to serve in the spirit of Christ. He will do his part. Tu also elaborated on the consequences of modern scientific education, agreeing with Ambassador Stuart's words, hoping that modern youth should experience and understand the relationship between people in life, and should pay attention to improving general knowledge. According to the school motto of "Learning without thinking is futile," Tu especially emphasized: "Learning without thinking is futile in elementary school, and learning without thinking is chaotic in university."

After the reply, the school song was sung, and the meeting adjourned at 6:00 after Bishop Luo's blessing.

### Free Medical Treatment for Citizens; Ideal Plan to Wait Another Twenty-Five Years

[Report from our newspaper] The small group meeting of the Urban Planning Committee's health group was recently convened by the Health Bureau, hosted by Zhao Zukang, Director of the Public Works Bureau, and Zhang Wei, Director of the Health Bureau. The meeting resolved that a large number of health offices must be added within 25 years. The most reasonable ideal is that every 100,000 people in a large city should have a health office. In rural areas, because the population density is smaller, 50,000 people can be used as the principle. According to the urban plan decided by this city, the future population of Shanghai is 7 million, so 70 health offices are needed, which is still far from what this city currently has. The number of beds in municipal hospitals should also be actively increased. It is hoped that within five years, there will be one bed for every thousand citizens. Within fifteen years, there will be one bed for every five hundred citizens. Within twenty-five years, there will be one bed for every three hundred citizens. And the ultimate ideal is that after twenty-five years, citizens will receive free diagnosis and treatment.

In addition, within 25 years, the city's tap water must be able to be universally supplied, and the sewage system must be well-equipped, so that the prevalence of infectious diseases can be reduced. The number of parks, sports grounds, and open spaces in the urban area must be greatly increased, and cremation should be promoted so that the ground is fully utilized. In the future, garbage, in addition to being used to fill low-lying areas and ponds, is also planned to use composting methods to turn waste into fertilizer to facilitate cultivation.

In addition to continuing to work hard to make the above beautiful vision a reality, the Health Bureau is now actively preparing to build a large-scale tuberculosis sanatorium with 500 beds. Medical equipment, medicines, etc. are all supplied by the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. Recently, due to the American sailors' strike, it has been delayed. It is said that there are no problems with the sanatorium's funding and location.

In addition, the Health Bureau plans to build a hospital each in Pudong, Huxi, and Hudong. The funding has been approved by the municipal government, and the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has also agreed to allocate medical supplies, etc., and construction will begin soon.

### Three Lines of Defense for Customs Anti-Smuggling; Smuggling is Gradually Subsiding

[Report from our newspaper] After the import license system is implemented, the customs will strengthen the enforcement of anti-smuggling work and are actively studying ways to improve efficiency. According to relevant sources: At the beginning of the customs' restoration, manpower and material resources were insufficient, so smuggling was very rampant. In the past two months, due to the strengthening of inspections of territorial waters and ports, many cases of smuggled goods have been cracked, so the situation has improved. In the past, many of the smuggled items were carried by sailors on ships carrying relief supplies to China. At present, the customs has been able to control this situation. Regarding the smuggling of goods by foreign warships, it is difficult to check in territorial waters, but land inspections have been strengthened in ports as a remedy. In the past, airplanes were also an important source of smuggled goods. Now, the customs has sent personnel to be stationed at various airports to strictly guard against them day and night. At present, the customs' anti-smuggling work has three lines of defense: the first line is a large ship that regularly patrols outside the Wusongkou; the second line is a team of small ships that patrol near the port; and the third line is two teams of inspectors who are responsible for inspecting ships after they enter the port.

### Another Entanglement After Plasma; Sold Narcotics; the US Side Wants to Take Them Back; Representative of Lida Bank Reports to the Mayor

[Report from our newspaper] The dispute over the resale of plasma from US surplus materials has just been resolved, and it has been discovered that medical narcotics are also mixed in with the materials sold. The US Materials Clearing Committee also issued a statement the day before yesterday: "We are conducting a thorough investigation into this matter and will take the necessary appropriate measures."

According to Lida Trading Bank yesterday, it is true that there are some narcotics in the medicines purchased by the bank. However, the exact number of types and quantities is still unknown. Because when the materials purchased were shipped from Okinawa to China, the customs did not allow the narcotics to be cleared, and they had to wait for the approval of the Ministry of Interior before they could be imported. Therefore, the narcotics are still stored in various warehouses and have not been cleared. Yesterday afternoon, representatives of Lida Bank visited the mayor to explain this point.

Although the Materials Clearing Committee has issued a statement, it has not yet begun negotiations with the merchants as of yesterday. It is said that the Clearing Committee intends to recover the narcotics in the same way as the plasma, and also recover them by compensating with other medicines. However, the merchants feel quite overwhelmed by the repeated problems with this batch of materials. Because purely from a commercial standpoint, there is no need to return legally ordered goods. Moreover, when the contract was signed, the various products on the product list were clearly stated, including plasma. Therefore, the responsibility for the mis-sale lies entirely with the negligence of the US side. However, because they do not want to involve diplomatic relations in this matter, the recovery of narcotics after plasma is also likely to be unavoidable. What remains to be negotiated is only the conditions.

In addition, what kind of medicines the US will use to compensate for the recovered plasma is still to be decided by the Materials Clearing Committee, the Navy, and the Marine Corps after consultation tomorrow (Monday).

### Registration Period for Import and Export Merchants; Plan to Request a Seven-Day Extension

[Report from our newspaper] The Import and Export Association believes that the recently promulgated amendments to the import and export trade regulations and implementation rules by the Executive Yuan have a significant impact on the rights and interests of the association's members. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, it convened a joint meeting of directors and supervisors. More than 30 directors and supervisors attended, chaired by Chairman Zhang Huanzhang. Chen Changtong, Secretary of the Executive Committee of the Transportation Management Committee, was unable to attend temporarily due to business. After discussion, many important cases were resolved. The two most important points are: (1) The registration period for import and export merchants in the amended regulations is limited to 15 days from November 17, which seems too tight. It is planned to request a seven-day extension. (2) For goods that have been approved for import, it is planned to promptly stipulate the shortest date for issuing permits.

According to observations by import and export industry insiders: In the past two or three weeks, the handling of import and export merchant registration matters and the exchange settlement matters of the Central Bank and various designated banks have been virtually declared to have been suspended.

### 1946 Land Value Tax; Calculation Offices Set Up in Each District

Delivery of Notification Slips Must Not Require Extra Fees

The 1946 land value tax in this city was levied starting on the 16th. In order to facilitate taxpayers to pay taxes, the Land Administration Bureau has set up five land value tax calculation offices in each district, and the municipal treasury has sent personnel to collect payments, including: South Shanghai District at 72 Shangwen Road, Xiaoximen; Fahua District at 116 Jingzheng West Road; Zhabei and Yinxiang Districts at 66 Zhaopu Road; Caojing District at Yangjia Ancestral Hall, East Caohejing Street; Huangpu District inside the Land Administration Bureau at the intersection of Madang Road, Central Linsen Road.

In recent days, taxpayers have been enthusiastically going to pay taxes. In addition, the bureau's delivery of tax payment notifications does not charge any fees. If the delivery personnel require any extra fees, taxpayers are allowed to directly report to the bureau by name.

### Municipal Government Takes the Lead in Strictly Implementing the "Three-to-One" Electricity Conservation Campaign

[Report from our newspaper] The municipal government believes that saving electricity is extremely important for national reconstruction. Government agencies should be aware of the difficult times and strictly implement it. Therefore, it ordered all its subordinate agencies to not only abide by the previously promulgated electricity saving measures for various agencies, but also to implement the principle of "removing three out of ten" and "removing one out of three" for all electric lights from today, in order to show leadership.

### Two Fires in Nanshi; Dyeing Factory and Barber Shop

[Report from our newspaper] The third floor of Taoyuan Barber Shop at 1264 Zhonghua Road, Nanshi, caught fire at about 2:30 PM yesterday due to carelessness.

### Stalemate Between Old and New Workers: Cargo Operations at Swire Wharf Halted; Mayor Wu Promises Swift Resolution

The shoulder-carrying dispute at the Swire Wharf on the Bund of Jinling Road, caused by the unreasonable squeeze of old workers led by Zhou Ruisun by the new workers led by Chen Shanyu, has left hundreds of people destitute. On the 20th of this month, all the unemployed old workers gathered at the Swire Wharf to demand Chen Shanyu to restore their jobs, and petitioned the municipal government, but no concrete results have been achieved. It is now learned that the group of unemployed old workers continued to gather at the Swire Wharf in the past two days, resolutely demanding reinstatement. The stalemate between the old and new factions of workers has forced the cargo transport operations at the wharf to be suspended for three days now, severely impacting transportation work. It is reported that Mayor Wu summoned the representatives of the old workers, Zhou Ruisun and others, yesterday morning to inquire about everything, promising to consider and swiftly seek a reasonable resolution. Furthermore, the British Swire Company, due to the ongoing dispute between the old and new factions of workers affecting cargo operations, sent representatives yesterday to urge the municipal authorities to resolve the matter as soon as possible.

### Judge Lectures Two Thieving Children: Behave Well While Young

[Our Own Dispatch] The District Court heard a theft case yesterday morning, with the main offenders being two children. One, Wang Fuming, is currently fourteen years old, orphaned with only one relative, an aunt. The other, Ding Zhongfu, is thirteen years old, whose parents run a small stall. They were arrested for stealing a gold ring and a gold wooden fish worn by a child on the street. Both confessed yesterday that they met through selling newspapers and were instigated by San Xiaomapi of the Great World to commit the thefts. They had already sold the stolen gold ring and two gold wooden fish and spent the money.

### Elimination of Water Theft; Police Bureau Arrests Over 100 Thieves in One Week; Comprehensive Prevention to be Expanded

[Our Own Dispatch] The Police Bureau held its first press conference yesterday. During the meeting, Secretary Zhu Zhonglu and Criminal Investigation Section Chief Li Junhou reported, respectively: first, to express gratitude to the Shanghai news media for their assistance to the Police Bureau over the past year, which has enabled the smooth development of various police affairs, and to hope that they will continue to cooperate in the future as they have in the past.

Crackdown on Street Vendors: Methods Changed

Regarding the recent crackdown on street vendors, Director Xuan, in consideration of the livelihoods of the common people and to maintain the appearance of this international city, has made some changes to the crackdown methods, which have been submitted to the municipal government for approval as follows: (1) In the Huangpu and Lao Zha districts, except for newspaper vendors whose displays do not obstruct traffic, no vendors are allowed to set up stalls on sidewalks or in alleys. If there are public or private vacant lots in these districts, they are allowed to concentrate their businesses there. (2) In districts other than Huangpu and Lao Zha, as long as the vendor locations are surveyed and announced by the Bureau, and the source of goods is legitimate, the types of vendors will not be temporarily restricted (originally limited to newspapers, snacks, and cigarettes), but each stall base is limited to three feet in length and width, and no sheds or stoves may be erected. (3) Vendor items will no longer be confiscated, and will be subject to fines or detention, except for those selling US military supplies or other prohibited items.

Entry and Exit of Foreign Nationals

Also, in October, 40 foreign nationals entered the city (including 31 American citizens, 3 British citizens, 2 Polish citizens, and 1 each from France, Greece, South Africa, and the Philippines). A total of 1,024 people left the city, including 684 men and 340 women. By nationality, the United Kingdom had the most, followed by the United States, India, and the Soviet Union. The destinations of the departing foreign nationals were mostly to the United States, with 270 people. Hong Kong was second, with 131 people. A total of 623 people went to 43 other places, including the United Kingdom and Manila. Last month, a total of 779 foreign nationals in the city traveled within the country. The most popular destinations were Nanjing, Tianjin, Hangzhou, Qingdao, Hankou, and Beiping, totaling 576 people. Another 203 people went to Jiangsu, Henan, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Sichuan, and Taiwan Province.

Campaign to Eliminate Water Theft

Subsequently, the head of the theft section reported that recently, theft in the Huangpu River area has been rampant. Director Xuan, in order to protect travelers, issued an order to the Criminal Investigation Department and the 15 branch bureaus last Saturday to implement a campaign to eliminate water theft. After a week of investigation, a total of 129 thieves and 16 receivers of stolen goods, totaling 145 people, have been arrested. They have been transferred to the District Attorney's Office today (the 23rd). In the future, the Bureau will continue to follow its original plan, gradually "from point to surface," "from land to water," and "from the center to the outside," and to implement regular comprehensive prevention. The arrested thieves, the "water rats" with high "skills," account for about a quarter. The targets of these thieves are: (1) ships that have just arrived in port, (2) docks, (3) warehouses. Their methods are: (1) using coolies to abuse their position for personal gain or employees to embezzle, (2) stevedores deliberately damaging wooden boxes during the unloading of goods, causing the goods to scatter on the ground, (3) false pretense of loading.

Prevalence of Theft; Culprits Located

The police also analyzed the causes of this rampant theft, stating that (1) it is difficult to eradicate evil forces, (2) dockworkers' wages are transferred and exploited by foremen, resulting in meager earnings, and (3) there are many ships without regulation. Receivers of stolen goods also have their special organizations, and true leaders are not easily caught. Most of them use refugees to go to various docks and warehouses to buy stolen goods, collect them, and then sell them in batches. Finally, Mr. Liu stated that although this arrest operation is passive, the security authorities are taking a stand to maintain security and to remind citizens to pay attention, hence this parade.

### Zhang Tao, the Fake Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Sentenced to Life Imprisonment; He Lowers His Head in Silence Upon Hearing the Verdict

Wang Bingyan’s Testimony is Full of Grand Principles

[Our Own Dispatch] Zhang Tao, the fake chief justice of the puppet Supreme Court, was sentenced to life imprisonment by the High Court yesterday, with deprivation of civil rights for life, and all property confiscated except for a discretionary amount left for the necessary living expenses of his family. Zhang is 61 years old, a native of Xiaoshan, Zhejiang. In the 27th year, when Liang Hongzhi, Wen Zongyao, and others organized the puppet Reformed Government, he served as a member of the puppet Legislative Yuan and chairman of the Economic Committee. In the 29th year, when Wang Jingwei, Chen Gongbo, and others organized the puppet National Government, he transferred to the puppet Supreme Court as chief justice, until the victory. Yesterday, he was escorted to court by bailiffs in a blue silk robe. With gray hair, he was saddened to hear the verdict, lowering his head in silence. The presiding judge informed him that if he did not agree with the verdict, he could appeal for a review within ten days after receiving the judgment, and then ordered him to be detained.

In the same afternoon, Wang Dong, also known as Wang Bingyan, 75 years old, from Changzhou, Jiangsu, was interrogated. He had served as the chief of the Zhabei Security Corps in this city. He was accused of serving as the head of the 7th district of the enemy's naval Baojia during the occupation of Shanghai, and of coercing residents to offer gold to the enemy. The defendant testified yesterday that he had devoted his life to local charitable and public welfare undertakings. During the Songhu Qilu War in the 13th year of the Republic, he was ordered to organize the Zhabei Security Corps of the Shanghai and Shi counties to maintain local security, comfort the defeated troops, and provide supplies, which cost more than 460,000 yuan, all paid for by his private property. When the War of Resistance against Japan broke out this time, he again supervised the Security Corps to defend the local area. After the fall of Shanghai, he retreated to the Soviet Concession under an assumed name and devoted himself to Buddhism. In the 33rd year, he was elected as the head of the district by the residents of the district. Because he was usually enthusiastic about local public welfare, he could not refuse the position, so he served for several months until February of the 34th year when he resigned due to illness. The matter of offering gold was organized by the enemy's Baojia Headquarters, and the residents of Shanghai were difficult to resist under the circumstances at the time. The case was adjourned for further hearing.

### Yu Qiaqing’s Coffin Arrives in Shanghai; Funeral Procession to Siming Guild Hall for Enshrinement this Morning; National Government’s Commendation Order Delivered

[Our Own Dispatch] Yu Qiaqing's coffin arrived at Pier 13 of the Bund on the Ruitai special ship yesterday afternoon. The family, friends, employees of the Sanbei Company, and the Ningbo Association gathered to welcome him. A large crowd of onlookers gathered nearby. A plain-colored memorial archway was erected by the Harmony Bank at the entrance of the pier, and wreaths were placed all over the pier. The Ruitai ship slowly sailed in at 2:05 PM. Yu's relatives were all dressed in white mourning clothes and hats, holding incense and kneeling to receive him. The military band played mourning music, and firecrackers were set off at the same time. The special ship docked at the pier at 2:25 PM. Colorful flags were fluttering on the ship, and wreaths were hung on both sides. The coffin was covered with red silk and placed in the bottom cabin. The red candles on the altar flickered, and Yu's relatives entered the cabin in order to pay their respects, with the women weeping loudly while touching the coffin.

This morning at 8:00 AM, the coffin will be taken from Pier 13 to the Siming Guild Hall for enshrinement. The route and roadside ceremonies have been reported in yesterday's newspaper. At 2:00 PM in the afternoon, a memorial service will be held by people from all walks of life, and at 4:00 PM, a burial ceremony will be held. The National Government's commendation order was delivered last night. The original text is as follows: "Yu Qiaqing had a faithful nature and a clear mind. In his early years, he lived in Shanghai, creating and developing industries and transportation. During the Xinhai Songhu Restoration, he raised funds for the army and did not shy away from difficulties. During the War of Resistance against Japan, he came from Guanxi. His patriotism was second to none. We are deeply saddened by his death. He should be commended by explicit order, and his life's achievements should be stored in the National History Museum to show his great virtue and encourage future generations. This order."

### Ban on Divination and Astrology; Hope for Gradual Implementation

Yang Yangming and Zhang Qianli Speak

[Our Own Dispatch] It is reported that the Municipal Government has been ordered to ban folk superstitions, including divination and astrology. According to Yang Yangming of the Astrologers Mutual Aid Association (all members are blind), he told reporters that in addition to begging, Chinese blind people only have astrology as a profession. There are about 3,000 blind people in the city who practice astrology. Therefore, banning astrology is tantamount to collective suicide for blind fortune tellers. Moreover, astrology has thousands of years of history. Based on the Book of Changes, it deduces fate, which is beneficial to the world and people's hearts and can supplement the shortcomings of the law.

According to Zhang Qianli, the person in charge of the Institute of Numerology and Philosophy (all members are sighted), he told reporters that from a political standpoint, the association does not intend to express anything regarding the government's ban on astrology, but from an academic standpoint, astrology is China's inherent philosophy. They deeply hope that the government will reconsider and suggest that the authorities take a screening examination method to replace the ban. Zhang also said that fortune telling can make frustrated people more encouraged, and make tough people reformed, so that the society reduces disputes. As for the association's purpose, it is to connect like-minded people, learn from each other, and at the same time persuade people to do good and engage in psychological construction.

### Implementation of Military and Police Transportation Measures

In order to rectify military and police discipline and strengthen the management of transportation agencies, Mayor Wu and Garrison Commander Zhou Tie Wu will jointly issue a proclamation on the issue of military and police riding without tickets, in order to supplement the deficiencies of the regulations issued by the municipal government in October last year. The new measures are as follows: (1) Military and police wearing uniforms and symbols can enjoy preferential transportation. Regardless of the distance of the route, they will pay the minimum fare for each route. (2) Military and police accompanied by companions will not enjoy the above rights. It is reported that these measures will be implemented today, including all public buses and trams in the city.

### Telephone Company Denies New Building on the Bund

[Our Own Dispatch] According to the person in charge of the Shanghai Telephone Company, he told our newspaper reporter that it is absolutely not true that the company will build an 18-story new building on the vacant land next to the China Merchants Bureau on the Bund. Because the location is improper and does not meet the needs of the telephone company. However, the company will indeed build a tall new building. The location has not yet been determined. The company originally planned to build a higher building on the vacant land next to the Juxingcheng Bank on Hankou Road, but it has not yet been approved by the Public Works Bureau. It is still under negotiation. Because the location is quite suitable for the needs of the telephone company, and the landlord of the vacant land also intends to sell the land to the telephone company. If the negotiation fails, the Shanghai Telephone Company will find another suitable location to build the new building.

### Fan Zhongqu Talks About Recent Economic Conditions in Sichuan Province: Industrial and Commercial Recession, Relatively Stable Financial Sector, Sichuan People Place High Hopes on Export Goods

(Reported by this newspaper) Yesterday, Southwest industrial and commercial professionals working in Shanghai held a banquet at the New Life Club on Tongfu Road to welcome Fan Zhongqu, the chairman of the Chongqing Banking Association, who had come to Shanghai. Many well-known figures from Sichuan who were working in Shanghai attended. The reporter met with Mr. Fan and inquired about the financial and economic situation in Sichuan. He kindly provided the following analysis: The financial market in Sichuan Province and Chongqing is more stable than that in Shanghai. The interest rate for general commercial loans is 1.1% per month.

It once rose to around 1.2% by the end of September, but it immediately stabilized after the issuance of 1 billion public treasury bonds. The main reasons why the financial market is relatively stable are: (1) Prices are much lower than in Beijing and Shanghai, about one-sixth. Pork in Chongqing sells for 600 yuan per catty [approximately 500g], and other items are similar. (2) The scale and frequency of large commercial transactions cannot be compared to the Shanghai market, making it easier to calculate the amount of funds to be raised in the market. (3) Commercial banks in Chongqing exchange checks twice a day, unlike here, where they only exchange them once in the afternoon. The advantage of this is that after one exchange, the amount of funds that need to be prepared for the day can be estimated. In this way, banks do not have to withdraw too much reserve funds, and a portion of the funds is not frozen, indirectly reducing their interest burden, and the market interest rate is not raised. In the past, some people advocated raising interest rates to prevent idle funds from being used to hoard materials due to low bank interest rates, but this did not materialize after being opposed. As for the current industrial and commercial situation in Sichuan, it is also generally in a recession. In terms of industry, the cost of products is higher than that of foreign goods, making it difficult to compete. In commerce, in the past, general stores, in view of the upward trend in prices, tried their best to purchase goods. Now, a large number of imported goods are entering the market at low prices, making it impossible for merchants who have stockpiled goods to sell them off. Sichuan people place high hopes on export goods such as bristles and tung oil, but today the transportation problem is difficult, and most of the ships on the Sichuan River have been requisitioned for military transport, which greatly hinders the export of goods. However, despite the above circumstances, the economic environment in Sichuan Province is still relatively stable. In the past, an industrialist predicted that the wave of industrial and commercial recession in our country would spread from the outside to the inside, and advised people to set up industries in Sichuan, which would be safer. Looking at it today, his views have merit.

### Truck Ferry: Facilitating Transportation in Pudong; Site of Ferry Station Determined; Construction Expected Soon

(Reported by this newspaper) In order to develop the ferry service on both sides of the Huangpu River, the Municipal Ferry Preparatory Office is preparing to operate a truck ferry. After on-site surveys along the river, it was determined that construction in the Nanshi area is most suitable. The following two wharves are available for construction: (1) The location of the Pudong ferry station is best on the riverside of Nanmatou Road. Most of the site of the ferry station there is public land owned by the city, which can be expanded in the future. The ground transportation of the parking lot can also be connected to Pudong Avenue. (2) The location of the Puxi ferry station is best along the riverside of Lujiabang Branch Road in Puxi, because the site along the coast is large and there are no important business engineering facilities. In order to speed up the progress, it is planned to cooperate with the China Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA). Equipment, materials, and ships will be provided by CRRRA. After the right to use the coastline and land is obtained, the Municipal Ferry Company will start construction, which is expected to be completed in two to three months. There are two design methods for the truck ferry terminal: (A) Using the Shanghai-style floating dock, that is, the ferry is parallel to the coastline, and vehicles use the approach bridge to land from the side of the ferry. (B) Building a fixed approach bridge or a movable drawbridge, with vehicles driving in from the bow or stern of the ferry. After discussion by experts, the latter method was considered to be more stable. However, although method A is not as convenient as method B, the equipment and materials can use CRRRA's existing materials, and it can be completed sooner. After this line is opened, the construction of more permanent ferry stations and ships will continue.

### Former Chief of Xinjing Police Branch Accused of Theft

(Reported by this newspaper) Zuo Ming, the former chief of the Xinjing Branch of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, is accused of using his position during his term last year to move redwood furniture from the residence of the traitor Lu Shiqing to his residence at No. 15, Lane 43 in the town for his own use. When he left office on March 11 this year, he hired vehicles to transport the furniture away. After being reported by citizens Tao Yi and others, the case has been investigated by Prosecutor Bang of the District Prosecutor's Office, and a public prosecution has been filed in accordance with Article 320, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law for the crime of theft. The defendant is currently released on bail.

### Year-End Performance Evaluation of Civil Servants: Municipal Government Strictly Enforces It

In order to strictly implement performance evaluation, the National Government issued a telegram stating: "The year-end performance evaluation of civil servants should be given equal importance as the regular assessment. This way, the judgment can be more accurate, and rewards and punishments can be fair. Since the restoration, there are many administrative tasks to be carried out. Heads of all agencies should set an example, establish a political atmosphere of abiding by the law and being devoted to public service, valuing practicality and striving for progress. The year-end performance evaluation and regular assessment of their staff should be strictly implemented in accordance with the law in order to eliminate the inferior and retain the good, and to ensure that rewards and punishments are fair, so that the effectiveness of government will be further enhanced."

### Occupation of Houses by Government Agencies and Troops: No Action Yet to Stop It

Regarding the occupation of enemy and puppet property houses by government agencies and troops in this city, Premier Song of the Executive Yuan has ordered the Songhu Garrison Command to be responsible for its enforcement. According to a reporter's inquiry with the Garrison Command yesterday, the ban on the occupation of enemy and puppet property houses by various government agencies and troops has not yet been implemented, because the personnel and lists of place names sent by the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau have not yet arrived.

### Section Chief of the Railway Bureau Extorts Money: Xu Shouben and Others Taken into Custody

(Reported by this newspaper) Xu Shouben, the third section chief of the Xihu Police Section of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureau, was arrested for extorting 1.8 million yuan in legal tender from businessman Zhou Quanfu in collusion with Ge Banghe, the secretary of the Collapsed Vehicle Industry Association, and Wu Yinchen, the clerk of the North Station Office of the association, during his tenure.

### Forging Seals to Defraud Huge Sums of Money: Chen Yu Arrested After Scheme Failed

(Reported by this newspaper) In August of this year, a man named Chen Yu, holding an official letter from the Jiangsu District Commodity Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, visited the person in charge of the Jiangsu Provincial Farmers' Bank in this city. The letter stated that the Commodity Tax Bureau was about to establish a branch office in Shanghai due to the heavy workload, and specially appointed Supervisor Chen Yu as the director of the office. Due to the urgent need for funds during the preparation period, the bank was requested to allocate 5 million yuan in advance, which would be returned by the Commodity Tax Bureau one week later. The bank, believing that the seals and official documents were correct, immediately allocated 5 million yuan in accordance with the letter, which Chen Yu took away. However, after a week, the Commodity Tax Bureau did not come to clear the loan, so the bank inquired with the bureau. As a result, the Commodity Tax Bureau had no plan to establish an office in Shanghai, and the above-mentioned seals and documents were all forged. The bank immediately sent letters to relevant firms and police authorities to pay attention to the arrest. At the beginning of this month, the owner of the Qianjiang Rongchang Match Factory was also defrauded of 2 million yuan by Chen using fraudulent means. On the 15th of this month, the owner of the factory obtained clues that Chen Yu was hiding in the Dongya Hotel in Shanghai. He made a special trip to Shanghai and reported the case to the police, who arrested Chen. Yesterday, the case was transferred by the police to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation in accordance with the law.

### Native Cloth Industry Requests Exemption from Business Tax

The Native Cloth Trade Association of this city believes that native cloth is a major sideline industry in rural areas, and both the supply and demand sides are poor people. In 1928, the government issued an order to permanently exempt the industry from taxation. In 1932, the government issued another order to exempt all native cloth businesses from business tax. During the Anti-Japanese War, local areas were occupied, and native cloth production suffered a major blow. Transportation was blocked, and taxes were extremely heavy, so the sale and transport of native cloth nearly came to a complete halt. After the victory, the production and sale of native cloth need to be fostered and developed gradually. However, the government has issued a clear order to reimpose taxes, which has greatly affected the future of native cloth production. The association has repeatedly requested tax exemption in the past, but has not been approved. Now, the association has prepared a document to submit to the Municipal Finance Bureau of this city for submission to the Ministry of Finance as a final appeal.

### Letter to the Editor

I was extremely surprised to read the letter from the Nanshi District Wharf Transportation Industry Trade Union published in your newspaper on the 21st of this month. The incident in which Ge Axi and Li Shunsen, workers from Wenzhou at the Rihui Port Wharf, were injured by Shan Asi (Shan Saiquan) who gathered a crowd to attack them occurred at 3:00 PM on the 17th of this month. I went to Pudong on business in the early morning of that day and did not return until the next day. I did not know anything about the incident before or after it happened. The Nanshi District Trade Union has groundlessly slandered me, spreading false accusations, which is enough to confuse listeners. In addition to submitting a complaint to the competent authorities, I am sending this letter to request that you investigate and make corrections. Sincerely, Jiang Xueqin, Wenzhou worker at the Rihui Port Wharf.

### Social Services: Reader Consultation

(1) Coughing Up Blood Due to Lung Disease

Huang Weiqi asks: I am a 25-year-old unmarried male. At the age of 17, I suffered from hemoptysis. After repeated examinations by doctors, it was determined that my lungs were normal. At the age of 19, the old illness recurred. An X-ray revealed two dark spots on the apex of my right lung, diagnosed as hardened tuberculosis. However, I did not receive any treatment. Since then, every time I overworked, I coughed up about a bowl of blood. I have several questions and hope to get your answers: (1) How should this disease be treated? (2) My lesions were only discovered after I was over 20 years old, so I think that my lungs became diseased after I coughed up blood. From a medical point of view, is this possible? (3) How can I prevent hemoptysis? Have any drugs been invented to cure tuberculosis? (4) Which hemostatic injection is most effective? (5) Is there any hope of recovery from this disease?

(Answered by Dr. Gu Yuqi, MD): (1) Since the X-ray photos have diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis, you should receive active treatment, rest in bed, eat more nutritious food, undergo artificial pneumothorax, or inject glucose calcium and vitamin C, etc.; (2) Hemoptysis is a symptom of pulmonary tuberculosis. If it is completely cured, the hemoptysis will naturally stop; (3) The most important thing to prevent hemoptysis is to rest in bed and undergo artificial pneumothorax, as well as cough suppressants; (4) You can use cough suppressants such as Codein, etc., for hemoptysis, and hemostatic agents such as Coagulen, Clauden Phrombogen, etc. (5) There is hope of recovery, so be sure to receive active treatment.

(2) Combined Fistula in Ano

Wang Huimin asks: I have suffered from hemorrhoids for nine years. In the beginning, two nodules appeared on both the front and back of the anus, causing itching. After half a year, the nodules ruptured, and pus flowed out every day. Now, after a long time, the posterior one seems to have a hard root, and another one has grown on the left side of the anus. I have several questions and would like to ask for answers: (1) Is it a fistula in ano, and can it be cured? (2) How should this disease be treated? If surgery is unavoidable, is there any danger?

(Answered by Dr. Gu Yuqi, MD): (1) Based on the various statements in the letter, I am afraid it is a tuberculous fistula in ano; (2) You can first use an artificial sun lamp for irradiation, followed by packing with medicated gauze, once a day. If it does not heal after a long time, it can be treated with surgery. Local anesthesia is used, and there is no danger. At the same time, you must take various vitamin pills and other cod liver oil pills, blood tonics, etc. You can also inject glucose calcium and vitamin C, etc. Because it may be related to pulmonary tuberculosis, it is best to use X-ray fluoroscopy for diagnosis.

### Speculators Fuel the Fire: Gold Prices Continue to Rise Yesterday; Central Bank is Conducting a Thorough Investigation

[Reported by This Newspaper] Yesterday, the buying market was again vibrant. The Central Bank's supply was limited, and the price surge rose again. It opened at around 2.605 million in the morning, and there was a scramble to buy immediately after opening, rising to 2.617 million. After that, it only hovered between around 2.61 million and 2.62 million. When the Central Bank allocated 60 bars at a price of 2.62 million, people's hearts moved again. The Central Bank, based on its flexible strategy, once again became stagnant, forming a situation of demand exceeding supply. It happened to be the weekend, and those who came to purchase and store for change came one after another. The market price gradually increased, and by noon it had risen to over 2.65 million. In the afternoon, the current transaction price rose to over 2.67 million, and then slightly fell back. As a result, it rose another 53,000 compared to the previous closing price. Gold jewelry rose to 280,000, while silver and silver dollars remained flat. The black market discount was still between 10% and 15%.

[Another Report] The Central Bank authorities have paid considerable attention to the recent fluctuations in gold prices. In addition to selling large quantities to curb the price surge, they are also thoroughly investigating speculators, especially closely monitoring the business of money shops. However, according to news from the financial sector, the rise in gold prices this time is purely caused by illegal merchants making waves. The gold reserves are sufficient and the supply channels are also very smooth. It is expected that the future will not be endless.

Foreign currencies were also raised, but the rise was less pronounced. The black market for US dollars rose from 4,780 yuan to 4,830 yuan, then to 4,820 yuan to 4,870 yuan. As a result, it rose several tens of yuan compared to the previous day. Hong Kong dollars were also raised by ten yuan. Hong Kong exchange rates were stimulated by gold and banknotes, and were passively prosperous. However, there were no actual sales, only the selling price was raised. Yesterday's price was 920 yuan to 940 yuan. Indian exchange rates were 1,105 yuan to 1,125 yuan. British exchange rates were 14,850 yuan to 14,950 yuan. There were very few buyers. US exchange rates remained the same.

### Mayor Wu Speaks on the Issues of Oil and Yarn: Oil Merchants' Small Commission Still Under Consideration; No Permission Required for Exporting Surplus Yarn

[Reported by This Newspaper] Yesterday, reporters visited Mayor Wu at the City Hall and raised several questions related to cooking oil and cotton yarn. He kindly answered them separately as follows: (1) The recent stagnation of the oil market, will it affect the future of cooking oil in this city? Answer: This city's cooking oil is regularly supplied by national and private oil factories at 36,000 dan per month. In addition, with the cooking oil transported from other places by traders, the cooking oil available for distribution each month exceeds 50,000 dan. Therefore, the stable price supply of cooking oil in this city can be announced. However, intermediaries often exceed the negotiated price when buying and selling cooking oil in the market, so they were ordered to temporarily suspend the market. Therefore, the stagnation of the oil market will not affect the future of cooking oil in this city. (2) It is heard that the cooking oil intermediaries are asking the Shanghai Cooking Oil Joint Allocation Office to give a small commission for the oil allocated by each factory. Is the Mayor willing to consider this? Answer: It is true that the intermediaries have no commission because each factory directly provides the joint allocation office for distribution. However, considering the interests they represent, they are only a minority, and the citizens who suffer from the black market transactions of intermediaries exceeding the negotiated price are the majority. The authorities' position is to maintain the welfare of the majority. The order to temporarily suspend transactions in the oil market this time is to prohibit black market cooking oil transactions and to make the intermediaries aware of the warning. Whether to allow a small commission is still under consideration. (3) It is heard that the Mayor has sent personnel to investigate the export of cotton yarn recently. Is this true? Answer: Yes, it is true. In order to prevent the export of cotton yarn in this city from being confused, it is necessary to send personnel to randomly check the export of yarn at any time. For example, the allocated yarn obtained by various guilds in the textile industry can only be used for the production of the textile industry itself. If there is any transfer to other places, it will be subject to investigation. (4) Do yarn factories also need to apply for permission in advance for the portion of yarn they freely sell to other places? Answer: Yarn factories must report and register the amount of yarn they freely sell to other places with the Textile Control Commission, and do not need to apply for an export license. (5) After the Textile Control Commission decided to allocate a portion of the yarn produced by each factory to old business associates of each factory in the Yarn Merchant Association, why is there still a lack of yarn opening from large factories in the yarn merchant market today (23rd)? Answer: Since the Textile Control Commission decided on this measure, each yarn factory is planning to hold a meeting to discuss how to take turns to open yarn on a daily basis. In short, the portion of cotton yarn that should be allocated to yarn merchants in the total monthly yarn production will be allocated completely one after another within a month. (6) In addition to handling the allocation of cotton yarn in this city, will the Textile Control Commission also handle it in the same way in other places? Answer: At present, the number of cotton yarn from this city sold to various places is quite large, so the first step will be to stabilize the yarn price in this city first, and the yarn prices in various places will also stabilize accordingly. After the supply of cotton yarn in this city is on the right track, we will then consider the distribution of cotton yarn in other places.

### Public Bonds Listing: To Be Discussed Later

[Reported by This Newspaper] The Securities Exchange had previously submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance, requesting instructions on the types of bonds to be designated for auction and the sample of the regulations. Yesterday, the Securities Exchange received a reply from the Ministry of Finance, stating that the case had been forwarded to the Executive Yuan, which instructed that it "be discussed later." After receiving the instructions yesterday, the Securities Exchange sent a letter to the Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank, requesting that the 20 million yuan in cash margin for the bond market deposited by each broker be returned quickly so that it could be transferred to each broker. At the same time, the Securities Exchange had submitted a request to both the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs on the 20th to quickly approve the return of the margin.

### Public Bonds Stabilize

Public bonds stabilized slightly yesterday. Category C of the Consolidated Bonds opened at 1,350 yuan in the morning and gradually rose from 1,340 yuan to 1,480 yuan. Large investors entered and then exited. Before closing, it returned slightly to 1,400 yuan. As a result, it rose by 30 yuan compared to the previous close. Category C and D of the Consolidated Bonds each rose by 80 yuan, and Category E of the Consolidated Bonds rose by 100 yuan.

### Export Tea Industry Requests Government Purchase

This year's export tea leaves, due to the exchange rate being only a thousand times that of the pre-war level, failed to maintain costs, resulting in delayed exports. Tea farmers and tea merchants have been in distress for a long time. Recently, as the end of the year is approaching, representatives from various production areas have gathered in Shanghai and held a meeting at the Shanghai Tea Industry Trade Association. It was decided to organize a petition group to purchase export tea, with the former members of the Promotion Committee as natural members, and Qian Liang, Cheng Yongyan, Ke Zhongzheng, Li Yuanzheng, and Han Junheng were added as members of the group. Shou Jingwei was elected as the head of the group, and Tang Jisan and Wu Juenong were elected as deputy heads. The funds will be temporarily set at a fee of 200 yuan per box, with half of the amount advanced by relevant companies and firms in advance. The petition group is scheduled to go to Beijing for a petition next week.

### Indian Silk Sales: Price Must Be Discounted by 30%; Order Amount Too High

[Reported by This Newspaper] People in the silk industry say: Southeast Asia is a potential market for silk production, because that area has a great need for national silk, especially India is the most promising. India did not suffer losses during the war, and its purchasing power is very sufficient because it provided food and supplies for the British military. The prices in that area are also high, which is also conducive to the promotion of domestic goods. However, recently, the sales of domestic silk to India have encountered two difficulties: (1) India hopes that our country's silk can be discounted by 30%; (2) When Indian merchants order goods from silk factories, the amount of demand is very large, often exceeding the production capacity of domestic factories.

### Yarn Market Resumes: In the Market According to the Limited Price; Less Subject Outside the Market

[Reported by This Newspaper] The yarn market, which had been stagnant for many days, had a slight transaction yesterday. The transactions of ten-count Liuma and thirty-two-count Xiantao two types of cone yarn opened by the Textile Construction Company on the previous day can be bought and sold in accordance with the association's price plus a profit of 5%, and a total of 56 orders were sold, totaling 150 pieces. Most of the buyers were local merchants and retailers. The transaction amount and price are: 67 pieces of ten-count Liuma, each piece priced from 1.56 million yuan to 1.60 million yuan. 1 piece of sixteen-count Shunfeng, 6 pieces of Fengnian, each piece 1.70 million yuan. 16 pieces of twenty-count Liuma, each piece 1.8375 million yuan. 5 pieces of twenty-count Jincheng, each piece 1.835 million yuan. 9 pieces of twenty-count Tiannu, each piece 1.8375 million yuan. 46 pieces of thirty-two-count Xiantao cone yarn, each piece 2.436 million yuan. It is faintly heard that there are people outside the market who are seeking to sell twenty-count yarns of various brands, but there are few buyers. Although the price has dropped by 320,000, there are still very few transactions.

### Suspension of Allocation in Other Places: Request to Come to Shanghai

The third phase and fourth allocation of yarn, undertaken by the yarn allocation committee of the cotton yarn replica industry association, was transferred and allocated by various industries under the association's system yesterday. Some members whose factories are located in other places have offices and sales offices in this city, and also use this city as a distribution center for purchasing and selling goods, and were also allocated yarn. This time, the Textile Control Commission approved that "those whose factories are located in other places are not within the scope of yarn allocation and do not need to continue to allocate." This time, it was suspended uniformly. Therefore, 11 representatives including Chi Laba factory, Wu Huancha of Jiangyin, Wang De of Wuxi, Zhu Chang of Jiangyin, and Xu Zhibin of Changshu came to Shanghai to request yarn allocation. They were scheduled to meet Mayor Wu at 10:00 AM today to complain that the black market in the inland is 30% higher than the allocated price, resulting in a special cost county that cannot survive. If it is not remedied, hundreds of cloth factories will see their businesses close. A certain gentleman in the textile supplies industry once built a spinning building. Foreign factories were allocated goods on a continuing basis. Authorities are considering whether to continue shipping from other stations.

### Application by Oil Merchants – Granted Freedom of Trade within Negotiated Price Range

[Report from our Newspaper] Over thirty representatives from the wholesale, retail, and distribution sectors of edible oil in the city held a discussion yesterday at 3:30 PM at the Grains, Oil, and Oilcake Trade Association. The meeting, chaired by Zhang Chao, adjourned around 5:00 PM. It was decided to petition the Social Affairs Bureau tomorrow to allow the edible oil market to resume free trade within the negotiated price range. Simultaneously, the Grains Association will submit the names of buyers, sellers, and brokers to the Social Affairs Bureau. Furthermore, daily arrivals of edible oil from various regions must also be registered with the market for reporting purposes.

The oil market remained closed yesterday. However, merchants from Hankou shipped 500 dan (traditional Chinese unit of weight) of sesame oil, which was entrusted to the Joint Allocation Office for distribution. It is anticipated that distribution to retail stores will commence tomorrow. The 200 dan of North China raw oil entrusted to the Joint Allocation Office by merchants the day before yesterday began distribution yesterday. Additionally, there are over 800 dan of green oil lacking distribution channels. Zhang Chao, the chairman of the Joint Allocation Office, has negotiated with over forty other wholesale oil merchants to allocate 20 zu (a grouping of units) to each, for distribution to the fried dough stick and flatbread industry. Yesterday, private factories allocated 500 dan of edible oil to the Joint Allocation Office, which then distributed it to 142 retail stores in the northern district. The allocation quota for each factory remains the same as before.

Furthermore, the local Rice Brokers Association, concerned about the lack of commissions for brokers due to private factories directly allocating oil to retail merchants through the Joint Allocation Office, which endangers their livelihoods, sent a letter to the Joint Allocation Office requesting a small commission be allocated from the distributed goods to sustain the livelihoods of the brokers. The Joint Allocation Office, deeming this matter related to changing the negotiated price, did not dare to make a decision. They will report the situation to the Social Affairs Bureau for review and instruction.

### Sugar Market Remains Stable

The sugar market trend was relatively stable yesterday. The association's listed price for spot medium-grade white sugar was 139,500 yuan. Raw brown sugar was slightly softer at 116,500 yuan. Shantou dealers offered refined green sugar at 97,000 yuan, Huanggang green sugar at 95,000 to 95,500 yuan, and turned brown sugar at 100,700 yuan, totaling 130-140 packages. Guangdong dealers offered several dozen packages of congratulatory green sugar at 94,000 yuan, with higher-quality goods. Xinghua dealers offered Xinghua white sugar at 130,000 to 132,000 yuan and brown sugar at 122,000 to 123,000 yuan, totaling several hundred baskets.

### Stock Prices Rebound but Face Pressure – Chinese Stocks Struggle to Rise

Yesterday, Chinese stocks were stimulated by news reports of multiple bullish (buying) companies, boosting sentiment. A stockbroker named Yang had a bullish position in Evergreen Cotton Yarn, holding it for a long time. However, continuous selling pressure from Guangdong dealers ultimately led to a surplus of shares, overwhelming buyers and causing a devastating collapse near closing. At the opening, all stocks showed a strong upward trend, attracting numerous retail investors. Some even switched from short (selling) to long (buying) positions. One-Five-One company aggressively bought Evergreen Cotton Yarn, displaying a strong bullish stance, leading the off-market price to exceed the on-market price. Guangdong dealers took advantage of the high price, continuously supplying Evergreen Cotton Yarn, causing the market price to initially rise and then gradually decline. However, Yang's position, alternating between long and short, faced prolonged contention. From 11:30 AM onwards, the market showed a strong downward trend, leading to a disastrous collapse near noon and significant losses. Only Xinyi Company, with No. 38 covering short positions, remained relatively stable with minimal losses. Near closing, under short-covering pressure, there was a slight rebound, but investor sentiment remained panicked, preventing significant recovery. Consequently, Evergreen Cotton Yarn, Maya, Evergreen Public, Jingfu, Xinguanghua stock prices decreased slightly compared to the previous closing, Xinyi remained unchanged, and Qinxing rose by half a percent. Many unpopular stocks had no trades. Rongyu, Xinya, and Annei slightly increased, while the remaining stocks declined slightly. In after-hours trading, Evergreen Cotton Yarn, Jingfu, and Xinguang slightly declined, Maya remained unchanged, and Qinxing, Huafeng, and Xinyi slightly increased. Off-market stock prices continued to decline.

Foreign stocks saw further gains in gold and banknotes. Buyers actively engaged, seeing lower prices. Starting from lows, they rose. Compared to the previous closing, Yeguang and Gangye each rose by more than 10%, the British Federation of Trade Unions and the German Association rose by half a percent, and the rest rose slightly.

### Indica and Japonica Rice Prices Fluctuate – Flour Trading Sparse

The rice market saw total arrivals of over 14,000 shi (a unit of dry volume) of rice from the north and south, mainly japonica rice, especially southern japonica. Indica rice arrivals were fewer. Baiyuan and Yinyuan rice arrivals were not strong. Market trends fluctuated. Southern japonica rice fell by 1,000 yuan, and northern japonica fell by 300-500 yuan. Indica rice was lively, continuing to rise by 1,000 yuan. Baiyuan and Yinyuan rice prices were high but facing secondary reductions. The wheat trend was mediocre. Flour demand weakened further, declining steadily. Mixed-brand flour fell again by 100 yuan. Factory flour was sold as usual, but lacked transactions. Bran was slow to sell in rural areas, with prices falling by 300-400 yuan. Bean cakes from Xinghua and Quanzhou made slight progress, with a steady market. Yellow soybeans from Fujian and oil factories had a few transactions. Northeastern soybeans rose by 300-500 yuan, Central Plains soybeans were stable. Green beans had very few trades, while mung beans were sluggish. Red beans increased by 300-500 yuan. Sesame from Southeast Asia remained unchanged, continuing to fall by 1,000 yuan. Raw peanuts from foreign traders were slightly accepted at higher prices, while secondary grades lacked transactions. Edible oil continued to be distributed through the market, but with a large number of registered retailers, totaling over 1,000, universal distribution was not easy in the short term. Raw oil and soybean oil were scarce and remained firm, sesame oil was stable, and red sorghum rebounded by 200-300 yuan.

### Bituminous Coal Prices Soar

The coal market saw strong sales of bituminous coal lumps and coal dust. User demand was increasingly strong. The market was filled with buying orders, and prices climbed steadily. All goods reached new highs, with Kaiping No. 2 dust being the most popular. The bituminous coal lump market was relatively stable, and transactions were active. Bituminous coal dust, however, faced insufficient allocation and high business costs, leading to continued high prices. Wood arrivals were relatively strong, leading to a sluggish market.

### Tea Market Sluggish

The foreign tea market saw many traders continuously selling due to general financial constraints. Although buyers took the opportunity to push prices down, the selling price of this year's new tea crop was surprisingly high. Most old tea did not meet demand, so purchases were weak. By the end of the trading day, activity had not increased. However, 1945 high-grade old Keemun tea held by major dealers did not easily sell due to its scarcity, maintaining its firm price. Domestic sales of red and green tea were sluggish in stores and among traveling merchants. Investor sentiment was stable.

### One Thousand Barrels of Caustic Soda Arrive in Shanghai

Caustic soda (Yue brand) was quoted yesterday at 1.9 million yuan, and American goods were quoted at over 1.8 million yuan, but few users purchased. The first batch of 1,000 barrels of goods from Hong Kong has arrived at the port, and more are expected to continue being shipped to Shanghai. There are rumors in the market that Shanghai caustic soda will flow back to Manila. According to traders, this rumor is not reliable. Demand for caustic soda (Stirling), old white cloth, and potassium chlorate is high, and prices are firm. Many are selling at these attractive prices.

### Cloth Market Weak – Textile and Construction Fabric Sold as Usual

The cotton cloth market saw substantial purchases of gray cloth by dyeing factories. In addition, demand from traveling merchants decreased, and prices in other regions remained stable. Yesterday, textile and construction fabric were sold as usual. Caiqiu fine cloth opened at 87,500. There was abundant gray cloth on the market, and price fluctuations were limited. 100,300 yuan was achieved for Old Serge, and 98,500 yuan for New Goods Serge. Jinlian Miaowu Serge 100,500 yuan and Gray Cloth Longtou fine cloth remained at 92,000 yuan, Caiqiu fine cloth was 88,500 yuan, slightly less than yesterday by 500 yuan.

### Wool Market – American Goods Still Dominate

The wool market has been dominated by transactions involving American goods, such as Melton overcoat wool, tweed, yellow wool, and women's colored wool. Wool and satin shops and men's and women's clothing stores are all distributors. This is due to the ease of profit, the lack of domestic products, and the high cost of production.

### American Cotton Bounces Back

[United Press New York 22nd] Cotton futures were volatile today due to concerns about the coal miners' strike. They initially fell $2.50 per bale due to selling pressure, but recovered to their peaks due to mill purchases and small investor buying, closing up $0.05 to $4.05 per bale. Also, the New Orleans 22nd reported that cotton futures closed up $1.35 to $2.75 per bale today.

### British Government Controls Cotton – Centralized Purchasing and Distribution

[United Press London 22nd] The British government today announced the formation of a Cotton Committee to continue the wartime centralized purchasing program. The committee's creation will allow the government to permanently manage the cotton business, succeeding the Board of Trade as the agency for purchasing, importing, and distributing cotton. This plan is expected to be approved by Parliament soon.

### First Shipment of Japanese Silk to the UK

[Associated Press London 22nd] The first shipment of Japanese raw silk after the war will soon arrive here. The exact number is unknown, but it is said that General MacArthur has ordered the Japanese government to prepare 1,000 bales and 200 boxes of raw silk for shipment to the UK. According to regulations, the UK should receive 6% of Japan's silk products in 1946. This is the first shipment to the UK.

### British Goods Arrive in Shanghai Continuously

[Report from our Newspaper] British cotton, steel, and industrial raw materials continue to arrive. The Jardine Matheson (Taigu) blue funnel ship “Greena Aple” arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon. The ship brought over 4,500 tons of steel and chemical industry raw materials from the UK and is currently unloading at the Jardine Matheson wharf.

### New Tung Oil Arrives Soon

New tung oil from various places has begun to appear on the market, especially from the Jinlan area of eastern Zhejiang. The first batch has arrived in Hangzhou. It is reported that over a hundred pieces have been completed in this city, with a price of 104,000 yuan per market dan (traditional Chinese unit of weight), delivered to the Qiangtang River thousand exchange. Although the goods are specified to have only two levels of footwater, being "truly dry," there are concerns that a small amount of moisture may still remain. It is said that the yield in this area is slightly lower than last year, but still has 70-80% production capability. The Jiaxing area of western Zhejiang is better than last year. The counties of Chongde, Tongxiang, Haiyan, and Jiaxing are the production areas, with Tongxiang covering the entire county, while the others only cover a part. Currently, the price for raw tung seeds is 32,000 yuan per shi (a unit of dry volume). Production is not yet at its peak. Local oil mills have started crushing seeds, and the oil quality is better than last year. Tung oil (i.e., Heben) has also been opened early, initially at only 80,000-90,000 yuan per market dan, but has now risen to over 100,000 yuan. Deliveries made before the Beginning of Winter are settled on the day of the Beginning of Winter, while deliveries made after the Beginning of Winter are settled in cash. Oil delivery deadlines vary, and prices also vary. At current market conditions, immediate cash settlement for oil deliveries around the Winter Solstice is approximately 110,000 yuan, with prices continuing to increase. Before the arrival of new tung oil in the city, sales prices have not changed. After the arrival of new oil, the market is expected to gradually ease. The current selling price for Heben tung oil is 140,000 yuan, Neihua tung oil is 126,000 yuan, Longjian tung oil is 120,000 yuan, Truly Dry tung oil is 116,000 yuan, ordinary Lan tung oil is 110,000 yuan, and Jianmacheng tung oil is 112,000 yuan, ordinary Macheng tung oil is 105,000 to 106,000 yuan.

### Normal School Student Training Achievements – Ministry of Education Orders Special Report for Verification – Rewards and Punishments Based on Merit

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] In May of the 34th year (1945), the Ministry of Education ordered all provincial and municipal education departments and national normal schools to submit their implementation plans for normal school student training to the Ministry for review. Now, to strengthen the implementation of the above training and improve the quality of normal school students, the Ministry has issued a circular to all provincial and municipal education departments to promptly formulate methods for assessing normal school student training and submit them to the Ministry for review as a special project. The Ministry of Education's key points for this method are as follows: (1) Each department/bureau should formulate assessment items and methods in accordance with the previously reported implementation plan for normal school student training, calculating scores as percentages, with 60% as passing, and issue orders to all normal schools for implementation. (2) Each normal school should establish a Normal School Student Training Assessment Committee, with 5 to 7 members, chaired by the principal, to assess the implementation results of training at the end of each semester in accordance with the assessment methods promulgated by the department/bureau. (3) Each department/bureau should send personnel to inspect each normal school each semester and conduct detailed assessments in accordance with the normal school student training and selection methods established by each department/bureau, specifically reporting the normal school student training and assessment conditions of each school to the department/bureau.

### Too Many Fouls Greatly Reduce Excitement: Black and White Lost to Hua Lian Yesterday 44-36; Hua Lian Controlled the Game and Performance Was Remarkable; Three Black and White Players Fouled Out

[Our Report] The Black and White basketball team played its sixth game in Shanghai last night, facing the Hua Lian team, the league champion of this city. As a result of the fierce battle, Black and White were defeated with a score of 44 to 36. In the first half, Hua Lian took the lead with a score of 24 to 16. After Hua Lian led seven to six, they maintained the lead all the way, and Black and White were always in a pursuing position. Except for a slight competition in the first quarter, the game was filled with fouls, and as many as three Black and White players were fouled out, greatly reducing the excitement of the game. Cai Wenhua and Wu Chengzhang of Hua Lian scored the most points, and their performance was also quite outstanding. Last night's audience was estimated to be more than two thousand people, which was the first grand occasion for the visiting team to play in Shanghai.

Fouls Accumulate Greatly Reducing Excitement

The Black and White team's starting lineup yesterday was Chuan Yongxin, Shen Renshou, Cai Jindian, Guo Guoye, and Ye Kexi. Hua Lian countered with Li Zhenzhong, Cai Wenhua, Wu Chengzhang, Bao Songyuan, and Zhang Yuyi. Referees Zheng Zhifang and Wu Zibin blew the whistle to start the game. Guo Guoye committed a foul, and "Adi" Wu Chengzhang scored the first point with a free throw. Chuan Yongxin made one free throw, and Shen Renshou made one shot, giving Black and White a 3-1 lead. They then led 6-3. Chengzhang broke through, and Da Li scored, putting Hua Lian ahead 7-6. Wenhua and Songyuan scored two shots, making it 11-6. Black and White substituted Lin Ziyi and Xu Yinzhen for Shen Renshou and Guo Guoye. When Songyuan scored, the first quarter ended with Hua Lian leading Black and White 14-7. In the next quarter, when the score was 20-12, Ren Xiangcheng replaced Bao Songyuan. At this time, both sides committed many fouls, and each scored points with free throws. Hua Lian substituted Xue Chong for Zhenzhong and re-entered Songyuan, replacing Yuyi. The first half ended with Hua Lian leading 24-16.

Black and White Generals Fouled Out One After Another

After the break, Guo Guoye of Black and White fouled out after committing five fouls, and Xu Yinzhen entered the court. The score was 20-26. Black and White could have caught up in time, but they repeatedly made substitutions, resulting in nothing being accomplished. Ye Kexi was also judged off the court for his rude behavior, and the morale of the team was even more scattered. Wenhua and Chengzhang scored repeatedly, making the third quarter score 35-20, a difference of fifteen points. In the last quarter, Zhang Sai replaced Chen Xuechong. Cai Jin of Black and White and both teams scored. When the score was 47-28, Jin Xiangren was called down, and Bao Songyuan and Zhang Liangxiong joined the battle. Soon, Shen Renshou was also fouled out after committing five fouls, and Lin Ziyi entered the court. Hua Lian's play gradually became relaxed. When the bell rang, Black and White were defeated by Hua Lian 36-44.

### The Nine-Headed Bird on the American Political Stage: Wallace Becomes a Cultural Figure

— Our Special Correspondent in the United States, Mao Shuqing

New York Airmail, 17th

Wallace is truly an utter "eccentric" in the ups and downs of American politics. Many Americans simply cannot understand Wallace's thoughts and actions. Sometimes he is very naive, dancing for joy when he sees the cheers of the crowd. Sometimes he is very heavy, instantly casting a layer of gloom over the entire political atmosphere. Nowadays, in the United States, apart from the Communist Party constantly shouting "workers," most workers regard Wallace as their true friend. However, he himself comes from a large manor landowner background in the Midwest. It is said that the inheritance Wallace received from his ancestors is considerable. Therefore, Wallace has never experienced the hardships and bitterness of the world in his life. Wallace himself is still able to maintain a bit of "naiveté" on the political stage, which is entirely due to his environment.

Wallace Portrayed in Women's Clothing

The day the Secretary of Commerce was forced to resign, Wallace became the focus of national attention. Judging from the attitude of the New York news media that I saw: among the dozen or so morning and evening newspapers in the city, apart from the Communist "Daily Worker" and Marshall Field's "Afternoon News" supporting and sympathizing with Wallace, and the "Daily Post" being relatively neutral, all other newspapers, large and small, denounced Wallace's absurd speech. The day before his resignation, Wallace entered the White House and met with President Truman. They talked for three hours, and it was once rumored that a compromise had been reached. The content of the compromise was: Wallace would not make speeches attacking foreign policy until the Paris Peace Conference closed. Wallace himself would still be a member of the cabinet and continue to serve as the US Secretary of Commerce. When this news reached New York, the "Daily News," the newspaper with the largest circulation in New York, wrote an editorial that day titled "President, We Are Disappointed in You!" It said: Wallace is the most despicable prostitute on the American political stage, selling himself to red fascists. It also said: "If the President keeps Wallace in the cabinet, he will lose the government's credibility and disappoint patriotic Americans in the Democratic Party government." It also drew a cartoon, portraying Wallace in women's clothing, "leaning on the door and smiling," with Marshal Stalin holding a panda gun and passing by with his head held high.

The next day, President Truman forced Wallace to resign by telephone. New York newspapers all used the words "kicked out" as headlines. The reason for the expulsion is still a secret. Reporters inside and outside the White House are convinced that it was the influence of a long-distance call from Paris. However, Byrnes replied to reporters in Paris that he had not coerced President Truman to expel Wallace at all. This is a very interesting open and covert struggle between the three giants of the Democratic Party, just like the situation of Trotsky, Stalin, and Bukharin in those years. However, one is a democratic country, and the other is an oligarchic country. Therefore, the methods of political struggle used are different, and the results of the struggle are also different.

Led the Left Wing Ten Years Ago

If we want to trace this case back, we must go back to the Democratic National Convention in the winter of 1944. At that time, Wallace's left wing (labor groups and new liberals) and Byrnes' right wing argued endlessly over the vice presidential issue. At that time, President Roosevelt was still alive. He did not attend the "National Convention," and his speech was read on his behalf, saying in essence: Regarding the issue of electing candidates, he hoped to be the same as in 1940. This meant that he hoped Wallace would be re-elected. However, in another telegram, he also congratulated Byrnes on his efforts and hoped that he would be elected. This was Roosevelt's clever use of "impartiality" that year. Later, the stalemate was broken, and several behind-the-scenes bosses in the party pulled out the relatively neutral and stable Truman. Unexpectedly, Roosevelt died during that term, and the cracks in the Democratic Party itself were completely exposed.

I am not prepared to recount those materials in detail. Three months ago, I reported to this newspaper very early on the premonitions of the Democratic Party's split, which was long before the Wallace incident occurred. On the day Wallace resigned, New York newspapers spared no effort in sarcasm and ridicule. The New York Daily Mirror published a cover photo of Wallace with the words: "An unemployed person." Many people predicted that Wallace would organize a third major political party, because some labor groups in the United States, such as the most powerful CIO (Chinese translation: Shih Ai'ao Trade Union), were strong supporters of Wallace.

Daughter Jenny Gets Married

However, Wallace did not do so. After handing over the Secretary of Commerce, Wallace moved to the Wardman Park Apartments, which is a fairly quiet place in Washington. The apartments are surrounded by large lawns, well-maintained gardens, and a swimming pool and tennis court in the back. Wallace's family lived so quietly, as if they were detached from the secular world.

Reporters from various countries have visited him at the Wardman Apartments. He said: He was very busy with his daughter Miss Jenny's wedding. He said: Although he had resigned, he had to keep his promise: not to make any speeches criticizing foreign policy until the Paris Peace Conference ended. Miss Jenny's wedding was very simple. The First Lady attended that day, but President Truman did not attend. An amusing colleague asked President Truman afterwards, and the President replied very casually: "Attend the wedding? I've never done that in my life."

Old Aides Resign One After Another

"A new emperor brings new officials." There have also been some changes in the staff of the Department of Commerce. Chief Secretary Han Luyang has always been an old aide of Wallace. He resigned along with the Minister. He is now revitalizing his career in Washington and has put up his lawyer's sign again. The new Minister, upon taking office, first announced that personnel would not be changed across the board. However, some mid-level cadres still resigned one after another. Many people changed careers and joined the business community. These people were not "loyal" to the former Minister, but rather because the salaries of civil servants were too low, while the treatment in the business community was "too good."

Relies on Ancestral Property to Earn 50,000 a Year

Wallace himself is not in a hurry to find a way out. The New York "Daily News" reporter in Washington said: Wallace can receive 50,000 yuan in interest or rent per year relying on his ancestors' inheritance (including movable and immovable property). Therefore, he does not seek anything from anyone. That reporter said: He has political ambitions - the "Presidential Dream" of 1948.

Extolls the Two-Party System

I dare not assert that he does not have a presidential dream? I feel that the political routines and political morality of democratic countries are very lovely. Wallace was expelled by the Democratic Party government. However, on the eve of the general election, Wallace still worked hard for the Democratic Party. In any case, in the campaign arena, the Democratic Party needs Wallace. Through Wallace's so-called left wing, the Democratic Party can obtain the cooperation of the "Labor Party" and "Liberal Party" factions. For example, in this New York State election, Mead is the Democratic candidate for governor, as well as the joint candidate of the Labor Party, Liberal Party, and Democratic Party. Lehman is the Democratic candidate for senator, and also the candidate of the Labor Party, Liberal Party, and Democratic Party. One day more than a month before his resignation, I heard Wallace's speech at the Commodore Hotel. He praised the two-party system, saying: "Only the two-party system can truly follow the constitutional routine."

Two-Week Traveling Lecture Tour

Last month, it was widely rumored in Washington that Byrnes was about to resign, and even people in the State Department believed that their Secretary of State might resign. On the other hand, Wallace's two-week traveling lecture tour was to greatly promote the Democratic Party. Wallace planned to go to Indiana and Michigan first, then to California and Washington in the west, then to Minnesota and Wisconsin, and finally rush back to New York on the eve of the election. The Republican Party's rhetoric, as well as non-partisan people who oppose the "New Economic Policy" factions, began to attack Wallace again.

During the days when the "pork panic" was most severe, a Republican Congressman, Giggins of Ohio, scolded Wallace in Congress, saying: "Why don't the American people have meat to eat now? To get to the root of the problem, we must trace it back to Wallace, this dangerous communist, who has set up that set of controls." That Congressman even compared Wallace to a demon.

Resumes Career as Editor

Now what? Wallace has officially been hired as the editor of the "New Republic" magazine. The editing contract starts on December 16. He is joining the ranks of American cultural figures with great excitement. Thirteen years ago, he ran a very naive rural publication in Iowa. After thirteen years, he decided to resume his writing career.

This is a news item that contains "extraordinary" in the ordinary. The New York Herald Tribune and the New York Times both wrote editorials for Wallace. The New York Times wrote: The New Republic magazine is a prestigious publication in the United States. It is known for its left-leaning stance and advocates new economic systems, but it does not take orders from Moscow. This is in line with Mr. Wallace's interests. Since Mr. Wallace disagrees with the current government's foreign policy, it is appropriate for him not to remain in the cabinet. Now that Mr. Wallace has retired from the government and accepted the editorial position in a free capacity, he can fully display his strengths. "In our democratic country, we hope that Mr. Wallace will make full use of his insightful opinions and express his sincere dedication to world peace."

The New York Herald Tribune's editorial said: "Mr. Wallace's appointment as editor of the New Republic magazine can be said to be the right person in the right place." More than ten years ago, Mr. Wallace participated in the press and joined the cultural industry. Mr. Wallace has a talent for criticism and is able to persuade a wide range of troops. It is hoped that he will display this "critical spirit" in the future "New Republic Magazine." Then, the Herald Tribune also said: "Having more than two different foreign policy opinions in the same cabinet will undoubtedly weaken the international standing of American diplomacy. Therefore, it is appropriate for Mr. Wallace to withdraw from the cabinet." "The New Republic magazine is a publication called Neo-Liberalism, which has always supported Roosevelt's New Deal, which is in line with Mr. Wallace's taste." The Herald Tribune concluded, like the Times, hoping that he would do a good job and express his famous opinions.

In the United States, the New Republic magazine does not have a large circulation. It has no pictures or photos, and no advertisements. The printing is very dull, and the paper is very rough. However, its content has a considerable impact on domestic and foreign affairs. The founder of the New Republic magazine was Straight, who founded it in 1914. The first editor was Crowley. It supported Roosevelt's New Deal and was originally close to the left wing of the Democratic Party. In the United States, many self-proclaimed progressive and enlightened liberals are often shocked by the articles in the New Republic magazine, because the New Republic magazine is more "progressive" than them, and even more "free"!

### Visiting Jiaozuo

— Our correspondent in Bian, Wang Shoumei

Dispatch from the 13th

Jiaozuo is the "Little Shanghai" of Henan. It was originally a town in Xiuwu County, but its rich coal production gave it a special character. The coal production made it prosperous – it once had hundreds of thousands of residents, thriving commerce, and a wealthy population! And because of the power of coal itself, it is even more important today. It was "taken over" by the Communist army on September 2nd of last year, and the Daoqing Railway was also completely destroyed at the same time.

Following Yu East, Yu North was also engulfed in war. Since mid-August, under the command of Liu Bocheng, the Communist army mobilized twenty-eight regiments from the Taihang Military Region to besiege Huixian City, defended by General Li Zhenxi. Yu North, a land that was very important during the Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties – Xiuwu County was originally called Ning, and when King Wu of Zhou attacked Zhou, he "stationed troops in Ning," and changed "Ning" to Xiuwu – has been filled with the clouds of war ever since. Jiaozuo was recaptured by the Nationalist army at 12:00 AM on the 12th of this month.

The Communist Army Built Strong Fortifications on the Outskirts of Jiaozuo

The recapture of Jiaozuo was both expected and unexpected – no one thought it would be so fast! The Communists certainly did not expect to lose Jiaozuo so quickly, or they would have thoroughly destroyed it. Since September of last year, the Communist army had been moving things from Jiaozuo to their old base in the Taihang Mountains, knowing that they would not be able to stay in Jiaozuo for long.

The Communist army built solid fortifications in some places on the outskirts of Jiaozuo, such as Wulipu, Jincun, Huocun, and Daiwangzhai (the place where people waited for King Wu of Zhou) before and after Xiazhuang, and they used the materials from the Daoqing Road that they had destroyed to make bunkers and moats, which took a lot of effort and manpower! However, the Communist army's Maginot Line of defense was not used, and Jiaozuo was recaptured by the Nationalist army.

Nationalist Army's Main Force Carried out a Flanking Maneuver, Occupying the Coal Mine Hilltops

The Nationalist 32nd Division, an army trained by General Shang Zhen, known for their polo skills, recaptured Jiaozuo. The division commander, General Tang Yongliang, not only loved riding horses but was also excellent at painting them. Under the command of General Wang Zhonglian, he carried out the battle to recapture Jiaozuo. On October 11th, his troops confronted the Communist army in Daiwangzhai and other places. At night, he transferred his main force to the flank, flanking the Communist army's rear, "avoiding strength and attacking weakness," and occupied the hilltops of the coal mines, and occupied Jiaozuo, in order to avoid sacrifices, and more importantly, to prevent the Communist army from destroying the coal mines like other coal mines, so that the entire Henan would be oppressed by coal, and there would be a coal shortage everywhere.

Jiaozuo, the "Little Shanghai" of Henan, is no longer what it used to be. Under the Communist regime, workers could not bear the oppression, farmers could not withstand the conscription, merchants could not endure the struggle, and residents were subjected to the "turn-over movement" of local hoodlums and rogue "proletariat" "revolutionary fighters," some died, some fled, and the population of hundreds of thousands is now only one or two tens of thousands. How could it not wither like a flower?

Machinery Not Greatly Damaged, Mining to Resume in Short Term

The Wangfeng, Lidui, No. 39 wells, and many smaller mines with scale, no longer had their past production under the Communist Party's destruction. Now they are all filled with water. The army is cooperating with the mine leaders to carry out the work of restoring the mine. Fortunately, the machinery is not greatly damaged, and mining can be started in the short term.

After the recapture of Jiaozuo, telecommunications personnel and the post office quickly began their work. The post office started receiving letters on the third day after the recapture. The Agricultural Bank also sent personnel to carry out the work of resuming loans. The Appeasement Headquarters, the Provincial Government, the Provincial Party Headquarters, and the Relief Sub-Bureau also sent personnel to inspect – the work of restoration is underway.

Jiaozuo is a place that has undergone the Communist Party's "revolution" test. In the hands of the Communist Party, it is heading towards decline and a miserable situation day by day. When will it be able to recover? All the phenomena here are "heartbreaking and heartbreaking, and it is sad and difficult to look back!"

Ministry of Communications Building Daoqing Road, Revitalizing the Artery of Yu North

People, supporting the old and leading the young, are returning here in an endless stream. They have to walk through the destroyed villages and towns, the barren fields, and greet the villagers with their faces of vegetables, what is the taste in their hearts!

The Ministry of Communications has ordered the Railway Bureau to carry out the work of rebuilding the Daoqing Road. It is hoped that the road can be built quickly so that the land and people of Yu North can be revived by relying on this artery.

What the Communist army left to the land and people of Yu North is pain. How should the border currency be dealt with? Land issues, property issues, etc., hopefully, there will be quick and proper solutions.

Perceptions of the PingSui and PingHan Lines

Finally, Commander Sun said about his perceptions of the PingSui and PingHan lines during his inspection over the past two months: seeing the suffering of the people in various places, he felt more and more the lovability of the people. In all the places that had been occupied by the Communist army, many county magistrates and public education personnel sent by the government were killed, and even the poor people who had worked for the government were assassinated by the Communist army at night. The terror created by the Communist army in various places has made it impossible for the people to live in peace. Conscription and extortion made it impossible for the people to survive. The Communist army's requisition of grain in various places even went so far as to ask the people for the grain tax of the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War. The shops were also all controlled and run by the Communist army. The people said that everything was done for them.

When Commander Sun returned from Tangshan, the reporter interviewed him again at the station. He said that in order to strengthen the local security in Ji East, it has been decided to set up a joint office of the Party, government, military, and civilians under the Ji East Appeasement Headquarters, which can avoid the past scattered situation. During this trip to Tangshan, Sun also decided to deploy powerful troops outside Beining Road, and the line of defense work focused on strengthening the people's organization. He believes that without this, the safety of transportation cannot be guaranteed.

### Record of Talks with Sun Lianzhong

— Our Tianjin Special Correspondent Li Shaolin

Dispatch from the 5th

Sun Lianzhong, Commander of the 11th War Zone, came to Tianjin from Beiping yesterday, and went to Tangshan from Tianjin once, and returned to Ping via Jin from Tangshan on the 4th. When Commander Sun decided to come to Tianjin, the reporter saw him twice, the first time when he first arrived, at his temporary residence, and the second time when he returned from Tangshan, meeting in the car.

The first visit was very long and covered a wide range of issues. That day happened to be the day when the Nationalist army cleared the northern section of the Ping-Han Railway, but the news of the meeting had not yet spread. When the reporter asked about this issue, Commander Sun replied, "It has already been cleared today." The reporter asked, "Will the Communist army launch another offensive in Hebei Province?" His answer was very relaxed. He said, "There is no question of any offensive, but the weather is cold, and the Communist army will inevitably harass the plains from the mountains, but it will not form any problem." In terms of military affairs, when talking about the Communist army's siege of Yulin in northern Shaanxi, Sun said that the safety of Yulin was not a problem, and the Communist army's actions were just harassment. Speaking of the situation in the northern section of the Ping-Han Railway, Commander Sun described the Communist army's destruction along the line in great detail. He said: In Dingxing, Beixinhe, Gaobeidian, and other places, when the Communist army retreated, not only were public buildings destroyed, but also schools and civilian houses.

On the administrative side of Hebei Province, the reporter first asked about the local order and the implementation of government orders in various places. Sun said: The local order is not yet good, but it is gradually recovering, and the implementation of government orders is the same. In places that have been occupied by the Communist army for a long time, the implementation of government orders may not be universally implemented, but it is only a matter of time before it gets on track.

The topic fell on the refugees, emphasizing the work of organizing and training the people

The reporter asked Commander Sun: How is the government promoting the land policy in the recovered areas? He said: The provincial government had already formulated a plan for land consolidation in the recovered areas, and it is now being gradually implemented, and there are no difficulties. Most of the farmers in Hebei Province are middle-class families, with each household generally cultivating only seventy or eighty acres of land, and their lives are generally stable. When asked about the relief work for the refugees in the recovered areas, Commander Sun said: Wherever government orders have been reached, the Aftermath Relief Administration has sent people to handle the relief work. Sun analyzed the refugees at this time and said: "The refugees who have a way have already run to Pingjin to take refuge. Most of those who stay behind are poor and helpless farmers, and they are the ones who can help us the most. They rely on them to help with road repairs, bridge building, and transporting wounded soldiers, etc." I said: Helping these refugees through the winter and helping them so that the spring plowing will not be delayed due to the war should be a major issue at present. Commander Sun said: "In addition to providing relief through work, we are already trying to settle the old, weak, women, and children, and there is no problem with spring plowing next year. The people can safely cultivate in the fields."

The topic continued on the refugees. I asked again whether the government would assist the refugees in demanding armed return to their hometowns. Commander Sun replied that the government naturally hopes that the refugees can return to their hometowns as soon as possible and live and work in peace, but he believes that the local defense should be actively cooperated with by the local people. He cited Ding County as an example and said that there was no right-wing Nationalist army defending there, but the people had strict organizations and training, and had their own constructed fortifications, so although the Communist army besieged it for three months, it was unable to capture it in the end. This fact has made the people in that area deeply feel the importance of organization and training. Later, when talking about the education recovery situation in Hebei Province, Commander Sun said that the annual expenditure of the entire Hebei Province is 5.3 billion yuan, and education expenses only account for a part of it, but the schools in various places have suffered heavy damage, and it often costs hundreds of millions of yuan to repair them slightly, which makes funding quite difficult.

### Scenes of Hong Kong

— Our Special Nanyang Traveling Correspondent, Qiu Ai

Dispatch from Hong Kong on the 19th

After five years of separation, the appearance of Hong Kong is still the same, but the losses during the war, the difficulty of transportation after the war, and the strict control have made the performance of the Hong Kong market significantly different from before the war.

Banks are Abundant

Before the war, the banking industry in Hong Kong was not very developed. After the war, in addition to the resumption of business by the original banks, new banks such as the China Farmers' Bank, Southwest Industrial Development Bank, China Industrial Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Overseas Chinese United Bank, Zhenghe Bank, and Sichuan Salt Bank were opened; banks such as Kunming Commercial Bank are about to open, and countless large and small newly established companies and foreign firms are even more numerous. In the country, because the currency value is unstable, the interest rate on the market is very high, one-tenth or two-tenths interest is very common, that is, bank deposits can also get five or six tenths. In Hong Kong, because the currency value is relatively stable (in fact, it has been devalued), most bank deposits do not have interest, and even if they do, it is only one or two percent per annum. Due to the spread of civil war and the heavy burden of life, the propertied class in the country has flocked to Hong Kong. These people brought floating capital, there is no way out, some people organize banks, some people engage in import and export trade. Recently, because the population has increased sharply, the problem of housing shortage has become more and more serious, and some wealthy businessmen plan to engage in the purchase and construction of real estate. For example, Marina House on Queen's Road, someone plans to add three floors on the roof, which will cost about one million Hong Kong dollars, but the roof fee obtained from these three floors in the future will be more than one million yuan, and it must be paid in advance.

With the increase in banks, the number of silver houses engaged in gold and silver trading has also increased proportionally. Some of the larger silver houses even set up private radio stations, constantly contacting Shanghai, Guangzhou, and other major cities. In this period of volatile financial market, a piece of news can earn huge profits just ten minutes earlier than others. Merchants value profits and disregard the law, and sometimes it is common for them to be busted by the military police for setting up private radio stations.

Aviation is Developed

Maritime transportation in Hong Kong has not fully recovered, but the aviation industry has developed more than before, and the number of flights has also increased. In addition to China and Central Airlines, which specialize in connecting Hong Kong with major cities in China, Eastern, Trans-Asia, and Commercial Airlines specialize in flying to Hong Kong and various parts of Nanyang, Philippine Airlines flies between Hong Kong, Manila, and Honolulu, and British Overseas Airways flies between Hong Kong and London. Air France has an office in Hong Kong; however, its current route only runs from Paris to Saigon, and the section from Saigon to Hong Kong must be handled by British aircraft. Pan American Airlines flies from San Francisco through the Pacific Islands to Hong Kong, and from Hong Kong to Yangon, Calcutta, and then transfers to another aircraft, flying directly to Europe, crossing the Atlantic Ocean to reach the United States. This global flight business can begin in December. The most interesting thing is that there will be shipping between Hong Kong and Langmen, leaving early and returning late every day, and the one-way trip only takes twenty minutes.

Due to the development of aviation, the airport in Hong Kong has become a problem. The Kai Tak Airport in Kowloon City, first, has large mountains nearby, and second, the runway is too short to adapt to this aviation era, so the construction of a large-scale new airport has become the most concerned issue for the Hong Kong government, major airlines, and the general public.

Initially, the Hong Kong government planned to build the Ping Shan Airport, but later it was said that the airport did not meet international civil aviation standards, and at the same time, because the Chinese government and people unanimously opposed it, the plan for the Ping Shan Airport was abandoned on April 3 of this year.

The second plan is to build a modern airport in Deep Water Bay, with a construction budget of 4 million pounds. The construction project of this airport is quite large, first, the landmines will blast off four million cubic yards of granite, and then use these crushed stones to repair the coast of West Deep Water Bay. The airport has two runways, each 3,000 yards long. It is now scheduled to start construction in January next year, and the entire project can be completed by the end of the year after (1948).

Gold is Active

Although the use of banknotes and checks has a long history, people still have a different view of the shiny, tangible gold.

As of the end of October, no less than 100,000 taels of gold have flowed into the Hong Kong market from foreign countries. This gold comes from Mexico. During the war, the raw materials purchased by the United States from Mexico were mostly paid for in gold, calculated at US$35 per tael. After the war, some Hong Kong merchants with long sleeves and good dancing skills ordered from Mexico at US$41 per tael, plus handling fees and insurance, totaling US$44 per tael.

Banks and silver houses that ordered Mexican gold made a lot of money. Gold, which originally cost only 44 yuan, can be sold on the spot for US$60, with a net profit of 50%. Brokers who run to Guangzhou can earn another 10% to 15% profit. In other words, people in China who buy gold pay 60% more than the original price. However, the national currency is depreciating every day, so who can stop people from buying gold at all costs instead of storing the national currency?

Merchants are really clear-headed, one turnover is money. With money, not only the arrogant sister-in-law of Su Qin has to be respectful, but also the international stage of maneuvering and horizontal unionism has not been using monetary diplomacy?

American Goods are Flooding

Hong Kong was occupied by Japan for three years and eight months. This short period of separation made the general public not know what the situation outside was like. On this day last year, merchants who got there first transported a batch of American goods to Hong Kong, making ten times the profit. For example, medicines that originally cost US$1 were sold for HK$200. Fountain pens that originally cost US$15 were also sold for HK$200. Although the Hong Kong government strictly controls imports and suppresses smuggling, British goods are slow to arrive, but American goods are becoming more and more numerous. Recently, the American strike problem was solved, and freighters full of cheap and high-quality goods will arrive in an endless stream. This problem has made merchants who hoard American goods at high prices anxious like ants on a hot pot.

A few months ago, many merchants ordered goods from American companies and foreign firms. Due to maritime transportation, the goods have not yet arrived. These merchants see that American goods in Hong Kong are about to reach the saturation point, so there are many people who have been asking import and export foreign firms to refund the deposit recently.

Now, the major companies and all foreign goods stores, Western medicine stores, and watch stores in Hong Kong are full of American equipment, and even the streets and alleys are piled up with various American goods. Every time I pass under the arcade of the Chinese Merchants Bank, I always hear hawkers shouting loudly: "American matches, three big packs for one yuan, can be used as firewood." "American pencils, five for one yuan, cheaper than firewood at the official price." At present, there are not as many new American cars in Hong Kong as in Shanghai, but wealthy businessmen who can communicate with gods with money can soon fill the roads of Hong Kong and Kowloon with American cars.

To be honest, the momentum of American goods is much fiercer than that of Japanese goods in the past. The only good thing about Japanese goods is that they are cheap, but the quality is poor and the types are limited. American goods are not only good and cheap, but also have endless patterns, from military supplies to necessities, from new-style glass products to various cosmetics, everything is available. In addition, in the past, Chinese people felt uncomfortable buying Japanese goods, but now Chinese people, and even people from all over the world, feel honored to buy American goods. This kind of spiritual disarmament has a really big impact on the market.

Movies and Drama

### Talking about "Catching Ghosts"

— Guan Yu

A Farce Full of Irony

The purpose of a farce is simply to make the audience laugh constantly. Therefore, its content cannot be separated from sarcasm and satire.

Wu Zuguang boldly used a new method to finish this farce "Catching Ghosts." He pulled the ancient all the way to the modern, in order to explain: Zhong Kui got drunk and slept for a thousand years. In the thousand years, he never caught ghosts, so the world has become a world of ghosts.

There is no story in "Catching Ghosts," and if there is, it is very simple: Zhong Kui was the top scholar, but he was not hired because of his ugly appearance, and he bumped to death in the palace hall. The King of Hell in the underworld named him the Great God of Catching Ghosts. He went to the Yang world to catch ghosts successfully, got drunk and slept for a thousand years; when he woke up, the Yang world had become a world of ghosts. However, the author interspersed a lot of good materials in this simple story, which made this play a lot better.

The theme of this play is not in the story itself, but in the interesting interspersions. It is to expose and reveal the baseness and shamelessness of officials to the world. It clearly points out the philosophy of life of women, and even more clearly points out that rich young masters are drunk and lustful and prepare to be ghosts under the peony flowers. It also tells of the rampant illegality of local tyrants and gentry, and the repeated bullying of ordinary people. In terms of meaning, this play extremely exposes the darkness of all classes; in terms of form, it also fulfills its purpose of making the audience laugh.

Interspersing things from two old plays in the play does not appear to be obtrusive here, but feels powerful. For example, when General Qi took the stage with a knife, it made me think that this imposter general was an imposter after all, and even the set of airs of being an official was not like it. At the same time, it also made me think that being an official is just acting!

There is one thing that the playwright of this play should be responsible for, that is: the component of laughter is heavier in the first two scenes than in the later scenes, which makes people feel top-heavy. Perhaps the director did not reduce the component of laughter in the front, nor did he particularly increase the component in the back. That's why people have this feeling. Otherwise, the audience would leave the theater more satisfied.

The director made the actors move around to change the picture, and the introduction of the main actors on stage is very obvious. He has already achieved: if a member of the audience suddenly walks into the theater from the outside, sees the picture on the stage, they can know which person on the stage to look at.

The actors are all very good, and they can all maintain the brisk pace of the farce. Only the one who played Han Yu, the tone of his voice was prolonged, and the heavy and slow walking and movements created an atmosphere that was not supposed to be in a farce. So it destroyed the mood of the play! This should be jointly responsible by the director and the actor.

The four words that appear at the end: "How Can This Not Be True?" are the author's deliberate surprise after writing the play, fearing that people would say he was absurd, giving the audience a chance to rethink. At the same time, he also told the audience, "This is really the case, don't treat it as a farce, it's not a play that ends with a laugh!"

### The Director of "The Spring and Autumn of the Heavenly Kingdom"

— Ming Xin

"The Spring and Autumn of the Heavenly Kingdom" records a historical event of national struggle. Although historical dramas may not perfectly align with history, an important mission is to never distort history. The fall of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom was due to many reasons, but Yang Xiuqing's arrogance, Wei Changhui's insidiousness, and Hong Xiuquan's suspicion were factors that, starting from false pretenses, sowed the seeds of destruction. This demonstrates that throughout thousands of years of rise and fall, holding stubbornly to petty personal opinions led to the ruin of the country and the nation. In that sense, the script of "The Spring and Autumn of the Heavenly Kingdom" truly fulfilled its task of being faithful to history.

However, to the general observer, the stage production of "The Spring and Autumn of the Heavenly Kingdom" does not focus much on the Yang-Wei conflict, but rather highlights the love triangle between Hong Xuanjiao and Fu Shanxiang. But the author once stated in an interview that he wrote this script during the time when the war against Japan was suffering repeated defeats. The limitations of time and space may have placed many constraints on the author. But today, brought to the stage in Shanghai, even without completely revising the original work, through the director's editing, the audience may gain a slightly different impression than what the script provides.

The director believes that Hong Xuanjiao inherently has many weaknesses in his handling of the Hong and Fu characters. She loves Yang Xiuqing, but she cannot marry him again, so she hates the favored Fu Shanxiang and wishes she could get rid of her. She is the Heavenly King's sister, she has led troops, she has fought battles! For her, raising a sword is an easy task. The pain is that she has many internal contradictions, and Wei Changhui, the schemer, exploits her contradictions. As a result, she became unknowingly manipulated by Wei and became an accomplice to Wei Changhui in killing Yang Xiuqing. In order to "gain," she actually "lost." This is something she cannot bear when she is clear-headed. The reason why the repentance in the sixth act evokes sympathy lies in this.

As for Fu Shanxiang, in some aspects, she is also a woman of insight and courage. She participated in the Heavenly Kingdom's examination and became the female top scholar. Her ambition was to use this to contribute to the national revolution. Opportunity brought her close to the Eastern King, and her talent became Yang Xiuqing's pillar. She fully understands the hostility Hong Xuanjiao holds towards her. For the sake of the country's future, she truly wants to sacrifice herself to save the overall situation. If she were not a woman with masculine spirit and vision, she would never dare to go before Hong Xuanjiao to plead her case at the risk of her life.

Therefore, the director's intention in the stage presentation is very clear. Hong Xuanjiao has softness within her strength, and Fu Shanxiang shows strength within her gentleness. Although their conflicts are many, they do not give the impression of purely being a quarrel over jealousy. The director's painstaking efforts are evident here, and it is worth praising and introducing.

Unfortunately, the historical drama can never be completely performed. Watching the performance of "The Spring and Autumn of the Heavenly Kingdom" amidst the flames of war, while the audience laments the defeated heroes of history, they cannot help but sigh at the tragedy of this era.

### City Drama School Students Organize Service Troupe

The students of the Shanghai Municipal Experimental Drama School have organized an "Amateur Drama Performance Service Troupe" to assist the school's drama troupe and amateur troupes in their performances with a purely voluntary spirit. The scope of service is tentatively set at: scenery, lighting, effects, makeup, and art design. In their declaration of establishment, there are these sincere words: "Historically, various schools and amateur troupes often find it difficult to achieve the expected results in the technical aspects of performance, such as stage design, lighting, effects, costumes, makeup, and publicity, due to various reasons. To remedy this shortcoming, we have created this service troupe organization, willing to help complete this arduous task with a purely voluntary spirit of mutual discussion and learning to seek progress.

We are young people who love drama art, and we are also young people who are learning drama art. We will not talk about profound theories, nor do we want to speak empty words; we are just working practically and realistically. We are willing to do our best to fulfill our due responsibilities."

### Child Star Yu Fuying

— Jiang Dao

Yu Fuying, the child star who played Lili in "Orioles Fly in the Human World," will soon appear in "Returning Home in Glory." She is only eight years old this year, a native of Baoding, Hebei, and is in the third grade at Lehua Elementary School. She is intelligent, lively, innocent, and lovable. At such a young age, she already knows how to act in front of the camera. In "Orioles Fly in the Human World," when Liu Ying first came to Ren Yun's house, she stuffed a handful of peanuts into Liu Ying's pocket as she was leaving, which was very realistic! It doesn't make people feel like she's acting, or that the child is shy. Secondly, when she didn't want to leave after listening to the radio, and was called out by her father, her farewell to Liu Qi was filled with reluctance, which was also very real, not showing any pretense or artificiality. She plays Lin Ling in "Returning Home in Glory," and it is said that there will be more camera time than in "Orioles Fly in the Human World." This is a good opportunity to give her more practice so that she can follow in the footsteps of Chen Juanjuan.

In addition to Yu Fuying, there are also several other promising child stars in "Orioles Fly in the Human World," such as Shuixing, who had a nail in his car tire. In front of the camera, he did not lose his childlike innocence, which is truly commendable!

In the two films "A Loyal and Righteous Family" and "Orioles Fly in the Human World," the acting achievements of the big actors may not necessarily surpass those of these child stars! (The photo is of Yu Fuying)

### Characters in "The Spring and Autumn of the Heavenly Kingdom"

— Yi Wang

"The Spring and Autumn of the Heavenly Kingdom" depicts the story of the internal strife within the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. Although the major and minor events within it are related to the Heavenly King Hong Xiuquan and the King of Wings Shi Dakai, they never appear on stage. The characters who do appear are the Eastern King Yang Xiuqing, the Northern King Wei Changhui, the Western King's Consort Hong Xuanjiao, the female top scholar Fu Shanxiang, the state man Lai Hanying, and the traitor Zhang Tingyuan. The interaction and conflict between these characters form a tragic historical drama.

The Eastern King Yang Xiuqing held the military and political power of the Heavenly Kingdom. He was wise and decisive, and selfless. His talent came more from experience than from book learning. Because of his wisdom, he could allow Xiang Rong to besiege Tianjing (Nanjing) for several months, while internally mobilizing troops, consolidating the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, and clearing the areas north and south of the Yangtze River, and finally resolving Xiang Rong's hundreds of thousands of soldiers? He was selfless, so he was not only strict with his subordinates, but also severely punished his brother the Northern King Wei Changhui, whom he had promoted, for his negligence in military affairs. Similarly, he also sternly questioned Fu Shanxiang's slander of the Heavenly King. Of course, he also knew that this was a malicious accusation with ulterior motives, so he couldn't bear to see Fu Shanxiang's crying. Because of his rich experience, he was organized in his work and use of troops. Because he knew that he "didn't have much book knowledge," he could reuse the female top scholar Fu Shanxiang to make up for his own shortcomings. Because of his trust in her, he fell in love with her. He came from humble beginnings, so he had a sense of loyalty and a simple and honest heart. He was also blinded by Wei Changhui's superficial gentleness and ultimately fell victim to him. But his death was mostly due to another aspect of his personality: stubborn self-confidence, arrogance, and pride. He could not weigh the importance of things, distinguish between truth and falsehood, or see through the inside story, so he suffered the tragic fate of being killed.

The Northern King Wei Changhui came from a merchant background and was skilled in calculation and infatuated with wealth and women. There was a traitor in the Northern King's mansion, but he was completely unaware of it. He only wanted to seize Hongluan, the Prime Minister's favorite. On the surface, he could endure grievances and be obedient, but he was actually hiding a knife in his smile and secretly plotting. He schemed, but never came forward himself. He knew the nature of women's jealousy, so he incited Hong Xuanjiao to kill Yang Xiuqing with her knife. At the same time, he also used his subordinates to secretly report to the Heavenly King that Yang Xiuqing was plotting a rebellion. This person only knew that "profit" was important, and fighting for power and profit was his true nature. Secret scheming and treachery were also the product of his background. He never knew to put the country and the nation first.

The Western King's Consort Hong Xuanjiao was a straightforward and frank woman. Years of not leading troops and being a widow had made her temperament eccentric and her heart narrow. Especially when she saw Yang Xiuqing, who had once pursued her passionately but now fell into Fu Shanxiang's arms, how could she suppress her jealousy and hatred, and the desire to strike a fatal blow? Moreover, Wei Changhui, like a powerful fan, constantly fanned the flames beside her, making her jealousy even more intense. She was confused about the interests of the country and the nation, and put her narrow personal grudges first, so she made an irreparable mistake. However, she belonged to the kind, and she had a kind nature. In the end, she finally repented and entered a convent.

Fu Shanxiang was a typical talented woman in the old society. In the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, she was like a crane standing among chickens. She had talent, knowledge, and insight, but she was also weak. She respected and loved the Eastern King, partly out of a sense of national and ethnic consciousness, and partly out of a hero-worshiping mentality. She was aware of the overall situation and recognized the urgent crisis in the situation. She could resolutely offer advice to Hong Xuanjiao and the Eastern King, but what was the use? These two were as hard as iron, and Hong Xuanjiao regarded her as a thorn in her side. How could her advice be accepted? The author has an excessive preference for Fu Shanxiang, even writing her as flawless, but we believe that she had some of the shortcomings of intellectuals.

The appearance of Lai Hanying is interesting. He is a typical representative of a muddled soldier. He would kill whoever the Heavenly King told him to kill. He had no faith or insight. Zhang Tingyuan was a typical traitor, with every cell poisoned by the Qing Dynasty's system.

The Audience Performance Company's performance of this play is quite meaningful, and the cast – Geng Zhen as the Eastern King, Shi Yu as the Northern King, Shu Xiuwen as Hong Xuanjiao, Fengzi as Fu Shanxiang, Zhang Yan as Lai Hanying, and Xu Ken as Zhang Tingyuan – is strong enough to be called strong, and under the direction of Ouyang Yuqian, it is believed that this performance will have a perfect achievement.

### A Shot from "Fantasy Journey to the South Seas"

(Note: Flying in the air on a magic carpet was originally a myth from Arabian Nights)

### New Film Ramblings

— Ma Boliang

Fantasy Journey to the South Seas

The genius Walt Disney, an artistic magician, from "Dumbo" to this "Fantasy Journey to the South Seas," like the shattered treasure bottle broken by Donald Duck in the film, scattered everywhere, colorful and infinitely brilliant, dazzling. His colorful brush also opened the door to dreams, inch by inch, step by step, truly a magnificent and picturesque world, breathtaking. Walt Disney's ingenuity and gimmickry have also reached their peak; the co-dancing of real people and cartoon characters, the singing of flower-filled beauties, and the presence of real people in cartoon backgrounds all prove the success of this experiment of real people participating in cartoons. There are countless beautiful scenes, white birds soaring in the crimson sky, a train in red flowers and green trees, dew drops on leaf petals breaking open a lake of ripples, and milky white trees dancing: extremely beautiful, the editing and rhythm of the whole film are excellent.

But we are very worried about Walt Disney. "Dumbo" and even "Fantasy Journey to the South Seas" have added alcohol and women, singing and dancing, completely losing all educational meaning. It is evident that he is now focusing on attracting adult audiences. It is no longer a children's cartoon, but purely an object of luxury in a prosperous society. Its focus has shifted to developing in terms of sound and color to entertain the audience, and therefore it is becoming more and more distant from permanent humanity. The cartoon characters created are becoming stereotyped. The three giants in "Fantasy Journey to the South Seas" are all arrogant and boastful villains. Only a few pages of paintings introducing Mexico, and a few greeting card-like pictures, are the only moments of quietness worth savoring in the disturbance. I like those faces of Mexican natives lighting candles and looking for a place to stay. Just as I like Carmen and Mona Lisa's dimples, and that currently popular song.

Flame of Desire

The director and screenwriter made Diana Barrymore successful in "Between Two Women," but the director and screenwriter did not give Donna Reed much to work with. Donna has a pure beauty. I still remember her beautiful figure behind the transparent umbrella in "The Human Comedy." I believe she has simple skills. The great director Capra recently took a liking to her and extended her contract to star in his first major work after the war, which shows that she is a talented individual. In fact, the subject matter of "Flame of Desire" could have become a beautiful story, but it lacks a coherent tempo and harmony. The second half is even more mediocre. Director Robert Leonard cannot avoid blame. Apart from a boxing match and a small opening section, everything else is simple and perfunctory. The sound, photography, and other elements were not properly managed. In the inn scene, the car drives in and out repeatedly, and the young lovers' cooperative dancing scene was not grasped, and no kind and sincere emotions were developed. These are all faults. A director whose representative works are "The Great Ziegfeld" and "The Gay Bride" is naturally not outstanding. Compared to Victor Fleming in "A Guy Named Joe" or William Dieterle in "Since You Went Away," he is indeed eclipsed. Charles Laughton is competent. Lee J. Cobb, who plays Neble, is a rising star worth mentioning.

Canary Row

Another wonderful comedy after "Between Two Women," again with the theme of a wealthy daughter pursuing a poor man. The clever thing is that it borrows the idea of a European princess seeking refuge. The scenes of women and men in pajamas are similar to "Happy Land," but the use of only a few title cards is better than "Happy Land." Norman Z. McLeod served as both director and screenwriter. The script and directing techniques are equally concise, relaxed, and lively. In particular, the dialogue in the script is humorous, eliciting natural laughter everywhere. The humor of "Between Two Women" mostly relies on action, which becomes contrived when overdone. "Canary Row" relies entirely on humorous language, and unlike Bob Hope's set of old tricks, the wonderful discussions in "The More the Merrier" and "My Eleven Brothers" are enough to make you laugh. Also, the princess's casual talk with her uncle Something Something's spouse is hilarious. The matchmaker president has not yet revealed his tricks. The highlight of the ending is the clever use of drama principles. It's just that the police shouldn't have been brought in, which is misleading. Olivia de Havilland and Charles Coburn, who plays the princess's uncle, are both very lively. Olivia should have wavy hair to complement her cheeks, which would make her more beautiful. Otherwise, she feels less attractive. Robert Siodmak is similar, "Between Two Women" is better. Dick Powell's straightforward style is also unique.

### Hermann Hesse, Winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature

— Zhao Jingshen

A Reuters report from Stockholm, Sweden, on the 14th stated: "The Swedish Academy has announced that the Nobel Prize in Literature will be awarded to the Swiss writer Hermann Hesse. Hesse was born in Germany and is currently 69 years old. He was formerly a theologian."

Hesse was born in 1877 and is 69 years old this year. He is a quiet, peaceful figure full of the Swiss spirit. He is good at writing novels, especially short stories. His depiction of emotional changes is especially pure and clear. He is particularly skilled at conveying all the trivial and quiet things in the environment, vividly and accurately. He likes to recall childhood memories and daily details. Most of his works are very well written.

His representative works from his early years are the novels "Peter Camenzind" (1904) and "Gertrud" (1910). Ludwig Lewisohn, in his book "The Spirit of Modern German Literature," writes about these two books: "Hesse is a master of interpreting novels. His novels are few and short, but full of lyrical atmosphere. His best works, "Peter Camenzind" and "Gertrud," are written in the first person and are full of simple and lovely depictions of the scenery of southwestern Germany. The student Camenzind and the musician Kuhn in "Gertrud" are both passionate souls, full of calls for life, "the flowers of youth, and this lovely world." Both of them fail and cannot satisfy their calls. Camenzind cannot express his true self to his companions, and Kuhn is a cripple. Therefore, the endings of both books carry a tone of defeat and retreat. But these two people are not disappointed with life. In their dissatisfaction, there rises praise for the beauty and change, the fun and passion of nature. In loneliness and failure, they are still affirming life."

"Peter Camenzind" is about a Swedish farm boy who, after wandering and being disappointed, returns home and finds comfort. Other famous novels include "Beneath the Wheel" (Unterm Rad, 1905), which describes a troubled student who initially overcomes the environment but eventually commits suicide and becomes a victim of the environment. The novella "Demian" (1919) won the Fontane Prize. It describes the development of young people before the war and the influence of the times. His talent for narration reached full maturity here, and this became Hesse's most successful and immortal masterpiece. "Journey to India" (Aus Indien, 1913) is also written with lingering emotion. His "Knulp" is the most exquisitely written short piece describing trivial matters and leisure.

His short stories can be said to be pearls, including the following: "This Side" (Diesseits, 1907), "Neighbor" (Nachbar, 1908), "Detours" (Umwege, 1910), "Small Garden" (Kleine Garten, 1919), "Fairy Tale" (Marchen, 1919), and "Klingsor's Last Summer" (Klingsors Letzler Sommer, 1920).

There is also a book "Zarathustra's Return" (Zaratu tras Wiederkehr, 1920), which is also a good work dedicated to young people.

### Mutual Help in a Dry Rut—A Sentimental Reflection on the "Literary Talk Society"—

— Shi Xinghuo

In the "Chunqiu" column, I have read more than once suggestions and news about the "Literary Talk Society." Living in a remote small town, I have no chance to participate in this grand event in person, to witness the demeanor of senior writers, and to receive their teachings; but I truly yearn for this meaningful gathering. Every time I see the small invitation card published in the "Chunqiu" corner, I wish I could immediately sprout wings and fly to Shanghai to sit in a lowly seat. However, in this day when shrinking the earth is impossible, this hope remains just a hope, and I don't know when it will be fulfilled. However, I have a small idea that I have long wanted to offer through writing as a most sincere contribution to the Literary Talk Society:

In this historically unprecedented era of disasters and hardships, as a literary person, the difficulties encountered are often greater than those of ordinary people. This is because they are sensitive, stubborn, and brave in fighting against reality, unwilling to succumb to the environment; they have sharp eyes, not only clearly observing the past and seeing through the present, but also able to look forward to the future; they have a pen that serves justice and truth, never willing to write a word that deceives their conscience, or even a character that violates reason...!

Because of this, it is as if they are destined to constantly endure spiritual and physical torments that ordinary people cannot endure, even threatening their lives.

The literary people who are fortunate enough to escape the disaster of the axe, if they are not accustomed to licking blood off the tip of the knife, the mental torture alone is unbearable.

Since ancient times, it has always been said, "Suffering hardship makes one skilled." In fact, this saying was fabricated by those who live in luxury and without worry to deceive people. They themselves are accustomed to eating delicacies, but want others to write articles on an empty stomach.

In fact, when writers have to waste a large amount of time running around for firewood, rice, oil, and salt, waste it on fetching water, washing clothes, mending socks, chopping firewood, waste it on illness, insomnia, anxiety, and fear, it is inevitable that decent works cannot be produced today.

The low value of articles has not started today, but the disparity between the price of articles and bread can be said to be greater than ever before. Currently, the fees for general newspaper articles are only three to five thousand yuan per thousand words, which is really not enough for a meager meal. Even the higher fees are only ten thousand yuan per thousand words, which is far from the pre-war standard of two to five yuan per thousand words. Before the war, writers who relied on article income to maintain their lives could avoid hunger and cold if they could write an average of 20,000 words per month for a family of three. What about now?——Moreover, the hardship of life directly affects the emotions and work efficiency of writers. People who could originally write 20,000 words per month, due to the troubles of firewood, rice, oil, and salt, have no peace of mind for a moment, and probably have to discount their output.

In this era, are those who still hold onto their pens and refuse to let go, wearing the empty title of "writer" and unwilling to change careers, not complete fools? The clothes they wear and the food they eat are so crude that the general public in society does not take them seriously, and their social status declines along with their living standards.

Recently, I saw four consecutive comic strips in a certain evening newspaper, depicting a literary person buried in writing on a wooden box, while his wife and children cry beside him due to hunger and cold. Then the literary person becomes ill and dies, leaving behind a pile of tattered books, which his wife finally takes to a used bookstore to exchange for a few coins to buy pancakes to fill their stomachs.

This is the fate of literary people, this is the fate of Chinese literary people in the 1950s!

Is this fate really ordained by destiny? Can this fate really not be changed by human effort?

Many people laugh at us as fools, as Ah Q, but we ourselves feel at ease. Over the millennia, many heroes and powerful figures who were once prominent have returned to dust, but only the works of art created by literary people are eternally new. They also suffered countless hardships at the time, but no hardship could make them bow their heads. Therefore, their spirit gained eternal life along with those eternal works, like Homer, Shakespeare, Byron, Goethe, Turgenev, Maupassant, like Qu Yuan, Du Fu, Li Bai... They transcend national boundaries and ancient and modern times, forever giving people spiritual nourishment and warmth; in the history of mankind, if there had not been so many literary giants, where would the brilliant fruits of culture in this world have come from?

In a dry rut, mutual support, warmth, and empathy among kind and upward-striving writers, and even passionate exchanges, are indeed very necessary: only collective strength can encourage each constituent element to bravely strive upward and overcome all external temptations; only collective strength can solve individual difficulties and promote the publishing industry to change the past practice of "braising writer meat," so that authors can obtain the rights they deserve.

This kind of informal gathering of writers can be widely imitated in various places, because writers in various places need to support and warm each other, and need to swim in the emotional current of the majority to temper and encourage themselves.

I remember Mr. Gai Zun once had a poem like this: "Mutual moisture creates a sea"; this is not impossible, because the rivers and seas are originally accumulated from drops of water. If each of us regards ourselves as a drop of water, and we accumulate enough, can't we also form rivers and seas? (March 5, 11, 15, in Gucheng)

### Landscape

### Smoking

— Lu Yang

More than ten years ago, when I was only a child of ten or so, I had already tucked away a small dry tobacco pipe and a silk embroidered tobacco pouch, pretending to be a little old man, an old smoker. In fact, at that time, I had no interest in smoking itself, but rather in the attitude when smoking; this attitude entertained me for a long, long time.

Since I was young, I stayed by my grandmother's side: she took care of the trivial matters of serving me rice and vegetables for three meals a day, and at night she slept close to me in bed, and always pestered her to tell me stories. Whenever a story reached a tense part, she would temporarily pause and pack a bowl of dry tobacco. Blue smoke drifted from beside the pillow, stimulating me to close my eyes, and gradually enveloped my grandmother and me, and the story seemed to become even more bizarre and ethereal. I loved my grandmother, and over time I also fell in love with my grandmother's silver dry tobacco pipe.

Old Wang, our family's long-term worker, was a warrior who ventured outside the Great Wall in his youth and went deep into the mountains and dense forests to collect ginseng. Although he is old now, he still holds a rough, long iron pipe weighing two pounds, with a mouthpiece as big as a wine glass. He often pointed to this thing, boasting about the heroic deeds of using it to fight in the past. Every time the evening glow dyed the mountains, after finishing the work in the fields, I had to wait on his back for a few minutes, watching him squat under the tree to smoke a big bowl; the smoke emitted from his hair-covered nostrils often made me fantasize about swordsmen and bodyguards, so I became even more eager to smoke.

Later, I begged and pleaded with Cook Zhao Ma, who finally sewed me a small silk embroidered tobacco pouch and bought a small copper pipe at the market. I secretly took some of my grandmother's or Old Wang's tobacco and actually began to exhale clouds and mist.

Since my mother sent me to school in the city, books and new games have replaced smoking. In a flash, it has been more than ten years. I have been away from tobacco for a long time. Resuming smoking is only a recent thing; and now I smoke cigarettes. The era of pipes and pouches is long gone.

When I am upset, distressed, frustrated, or angry, I smoke; one cigarette after another, while pacing alone in the small room.

When I have fulfilled a wish, done a good job, or returned from a short journey, and lie on the bed to release the tension and fatigue of my body and mind, I smoke; and prepare for the next start.

When I sit near the lamp to conceive an article, the previous section is completed, and the next paragraph is brewing, I smoke; my spirit will be relaxed by this, and my thoughts will be abundant. When there is a beautiful scenery, or when I encounter something pleasant, I smoke; the excited and blooming heart slowly closes again.

When a gentle breeze caresses the window, and moonlight sprinkles on the pillow; or when storms and snow control the universe, and my soul is entangled in the past, I smoke; from a series of swirling clouds of smoke, I see again my childhood, old dreams, and the affectionate eyes of my first love.

I endure smoking, and walk the road of battle with increasing determination.

I spit out smoke arrows, with a throbbing heart, and finished reading the family letter reporting the tragic news of my fourth brother.

I vigorously threw away the half-smoked cigarette butt, and blessed my parents living in famine and war.

I lit a cigarette and waved goodbye to my lover on the grassland.

Now, I have come to this sinful Eastern metropolis, and I will use smoke to record the marks carved into my life.

Tobacco has deeply wedged itself into my life, and is no longer an entertainment item of life.

### Expressing Sentiments on July 1st

— Liu Weizhang

Surviving the catastrophe after seventy-one years,

White hair scatters in the mortal world;

Not distinguishing who is noble and who is lowly,

Only valuing benevolence and righteousness.

The world's path is rugged, but my legs and feet are strong,

Human feelings are flickering, but my eyes are sharp and new,

In old age, I see through the dream of prosperity,

I do not dislike poverty in a humble lane.

North-south strife for another spring,

I, an old man, am not counted as a person of peace;

It is difficult to repay the country with my aspirations,

How often have I seen articles move ghosts and gods!

Time passes in sorrow away from home,

Righteous indignation in my chest extends in dreams;

Sometimes I chat and play with my grandchildren for pleasure,

Not thinking of Peach Blossom Spring to avoid Qin again.

### An Inch of Mountains and Rivers, an Inch of Blood 102

— Ye Jingfeng

As soon as this woman entered the room, her bright eyes, with just a slight flash, showed that she had taken in the entire situation in the room; what was especially surprising was that even Tsurumi, who was sitting in the dark corner, did not escape her gaze; perhaps because the lighting in that location was dimmer, her gaze lingered on Tsurumi for just a few hundredths of a second longer. This was easily noticeable to those who were paying attention.

Tsurumi had no need to be on guard. Even if this woman brought over the few guys who were lurking outside with her, Tsurumi would not find it very difficult to deal with them, because in terms of Tsurumi's work objectives, his position was equivalent to being on the dangerous peak of a perilous mountain, always on guard. In addition, he was also paying attention to this woman from a third-party perspective, detached from the matter.

That being said, the development of events suddenly gave Tsurumi a start: because the woman paused slightly at the entrance, for only five or ten seconds. Short enough to maintain her graceful and dignified demeanor and restore her original poise, before taking graceful and light steps, heading straight for Tsurumi; and from the first step, she had been looking at Tsurumi, slightly furrowing her brows, followed immediately by a charming smile.

Wasn't this woman's action a bit too abrupt? No. This action was not only not abrupt, but also had a necessary reason. In this reason, there were at least two or three important intentions: the first intention was to give Tsurumi a warning: "Pay attention, I'm here. Please act natural, so as not to make outsiders feel that my actions are abrupt." Or, "Pay attention, you need to be clear, I come with civility before force. You can't act rashly, and make people see that you are a novice. Even if you are not prepared to accept my attack, you must appear calm." Another important relationship was speaking from the standpoint of "our own people." Although the two had never met, were strangers to each other, one could not make it look like they didn't know each other in front of the other characters of He Shan and other secret numbers, causing them to be surprised and therefore pay attention.

The woman's warning of a frown followed by a smile, although it caused Tsurumi some surprise, was not because it contained secrecy, but rather because of the sensitivity of his senses. Although he would not be moved by this woman's beauty, he did have an aesthetic sense, otherwise why would he give her a rating of 95 points? This aesthetic appreciation, of course, could not help but make him pay more attention, especially since she contained secrecy and was also paying attention to her actions. With this longer attention, and the object of attention suddenly attacking him directly, he would naturally feel that this was an accident. Although the intentions were unknown, his instincts could not help but produce a surprising sensitivity.

"I'm sorry to disturb you, Mr. Tsurumi. Such rashness is truly impolite!" The woman said extremely generously, extending her hand as she spoke, completely imitating Western actions. She spoke with a pure Tokyo accent, and the beauty of her voice was like pearls falling on a jade plate, so round and jade-like. When she spoke, she had a smile on her face, and the smile was tinged with a layer of red glow, like a rose facing the rising sun, slightly opening the tips of its petals.

Tsurumi, on his side, had already stood up calmly, shaking the woman's hand in a gentlemanly manner, nodding slightly, and smiling, "Not at all, not at all, I was hoping for your esteemed presence!" Saying this, knowing that the woman intended to sit down, he also followed Western etiquette, moving the chair away for her and helping her to sit down. At the same time, he nodded slightly to the waiter who was slowly moving over, and gently asked this beautiful and unexpected visitor, "Would the young lady like to have some...?"

### Ramblings Under a Dim Lamp

— Shaofu

Late at night, the sound of the Jianghai Customs bell is particularly loud. The long, slow, and lonely tone fully illustrates the story of people suffering in time. Alas, your cruelty of every minute and second is both impossible to recover and drags on so slowly and tediously! The painful complaint, this bell! Withered vines, old trees, crows, setting sun, west wind, and skinny horse. The evening bell should also occupy a place in this scene.

Children are lovely because they represent hope, and their future time is very long. Adults like children, on the one hand, because of the sentiment of mourning the past, and on the other hand, because of envy.

The Bible says: Children can enter the kingdom of heaven. Here, it is explaining the meaning of "the pure in heart are blessed." Children are innocent and innocent, how can they hollow out their minds with deception and fraud? How can those who calculate all day long have happiness?

After the implementation of the import permit system, many non-essential foreign goods will not be able to enter, especially the ladies and misses who are used to using American cosmetics, such as perfumes and powders, will feel panicked.

Cosmetics and beauty are a huge multi-million dollar business in the United States. According to statistics, by the end of 1946, American women will spend 700 million yuan in this area. The number is amazing enough! In fact, not only women need cosmetics, but men also need them, but only to varying degrees. (In the same) year, American men will spend 30 million yuan on cosmetics.)

Loving beauty is human nature. Despite the restrictions on imports, American-made cosmetics will not disappear. If you don't believe it, watch what happens later.

### Gold is Not Happiness

The Battle for the Hardoon Estate

E.D. Sassoon - Who in Shanghai doesn't know the name of this lucky Jew? Shanghai residents have long understood the history of his life as a "successful speculator," from a "road inspector" who managed garbage to a real estate tycoon who was the richest man in Shanghai. How much was his wealth? Hardoon's estate was estimated at four million pounds when he died. This huge estate caused endless harm, causing fifteen years of entanglement, East grabbing, West fighting, a chaotic mess.

And recently, suddenly twelve Iraqis have joined the battle group, preparing to start another big lawsuit and entangle themselves:

It's a Long Story

This estate dispute is really a long story. Since June 1931, when Mr. Hardoon abandoned the wealth he had painstakingly managed and his wife, Madame Luo Jialing, and returned to the West, the issue of offspring caused a commotion. Then an Iraqi, a close relative of Hardoon, contested Hardoon's estate with Luo Jialing, submitting a statement to the British court requesting that Hardoon's estate be analyzed according to Iraqi law. Because according to Iraqi law, close relatives can get three-quarters of the estate.

Hardoon was a Jew, born in Baikt, Iraq, with Iraqi nationality. But some people also said that Hardoon had joined the Gong nationality. What "nationality" was he exactly? Hardoon had not made a "solemn declaration" during his lifetime, and could not be verified after his death. But the British government's greed for this huge estate was a fact, and the policy of the former Shanghai Municipal Council was based on the votes of taxpayers, and the number of votes was based on the amount of real estate. Hardoon's property was large, and he had more voting rights. Grasping Hardoon's property was tantamount to strengthening control over the Municipal Council. Therefore, the British government said: Hardoon was a British-protected person and should be subject to British law. The Iraqi lost the lawsuit.

As a result, Luo Jialing firmly grasped Hardoon's estate for a full ten years. Three years before her death, she went blind, but she still held on to the estate. She was Chinese, and China was fighting a difficult war of resistance, but no one had ever heard of her donating half a cent. To say that Hardoon had once joined the British nationality, when Britain and Germany went to war, there was no evidence that she had donated a penny to the British government. She was willing to spend money on the bald heads of several monks, helping them to create strange secrets.

Money is the Root of Evil

Luo Jialing and Hardoon were married for forty years, but they had no "sons or daughters," but they loved to adopt adopted sons and daughters, creating countless seeds of dispute after their deaths. During the early years of the Republic of China, when what was then known as "Kaitse University" was in operation, male and female students in the school who were favored by the madam were adopted under her name. There were no fewer than a hundred people. However, the madam was capricious, and if any of the adopted sons and daughters were slightly dissatisfied, they would be expelled immediately. In the end, there were only nine adopted sons and nine adopted daughters left.

Madame Jialing wanted to enjoy happiness and spend her old age in peace, but she did not expect that ten close relatives of Hardoon had hired the Japanese lawyer Okamoto, demanding to divide 43.7 million yuan in legal tender, and also published a "warning notice" in the newspaper, refusing to acknowledge others' disposal of the property. Then the chief accountant of Hardoon's Foreign Firm, Ji Juemi, was kidnapped on Seymour Road. Unpleasant things happened again and again, and finally his lung disease recurred, and he "returned to paradise"!

The adopted sons, adopted brothers, adopted daughters, adopted grandchildren... in the Aili Garden were first busy taking care of the funeral. A huge obituary was published in the newspaper, and behind it was a long row of names, which were those who volunteered to come forward and confessed to the desire for the estate!

As a result, the show continued; at first, the British consulate notified the police and sent personnel to protect Hardoon's property. During Luo Jialing's funeral, important documents of Hardoon's Foreign Firm were secretly moved by the bodyguard of "adopted brother" Ji Juemi, but were detected and seized by the police of the Municipal Council, and Ji Juemi later claimed that it was a misunderstanding. Even more "unfathomable" was that a "double case" was found in the will!

You Snatch, I Plunder

Hardoon had made a will before his death, in which he specified that 70% of all property should belong to his adopted son George Hardoon (stateless). However, when Luo Jialing passed away, a second will was discovered, with vastly different contents. Luo Jialing's adopted son George Hardoon recognized the first will, while another adopted son, Luo Youlan, and other Chinese "unfilial orphans and grieving children" insisted that the second will was valid, vying and stirring up a lot of trouble. Representatives of Hardoon's relatives in the newspaper also came to join in the fun, demanding that Hardoon's estate be analyzed according to Iraqi law.

The characters in Aili Garden were originally divided into three major systems: one system was led by Ji Juemi, and another system was the characters listed in the obituary, "deeply sinful, not doomed to perish." Among them, there were two factions: one faction was those who often served Madame Luo Jialing, and the other faction was those who had once fallen out of favor with the madam, such as George Hardoon and others who had been expelled. The "triangular" material was already very lively, and adding twelve Iraqis made it a "quadrangle," which was even more "amazing."

After the victory, the unfinished case of fifteen years of dispute was rekindled. Twelve Iraqi descendants planned to hire lawyers again to file a lawsuit. What would be the result? "Let's wait for the next chapter."

In short, stirring up and plundering is all for "money." Hardoon was reluctant to spend even pocket money during his lifetime and earned "too much" property. After his death, it caused a chaotic mess. The misers of the world can also be enlightened!

### "Chewing the Words"

— Maye

On the 30th of last month, a telegram in various newspapers said that the Northeast was planning to use "soybeans to manufacture wool." The writer once raised a question in the column, believing that soybeans are used to manufacture "artificial wool," that is, "artificial short fibers," and the word "artificial" cannot be omitted, just like "rayon" is different from natural silk.

After the 9th, after the translated United Press 7th New York telegram, I learned that scientists have "discovered a method of artificial penicillin that can manufacture new types of penicillin..." The writer does not have a method to find the original telegram for reference, but based on common sense, this time the "artificial" seems to also have room for consideration.

Everyone knows that penicillin is "extracted" from the culture solution of Penicillium, and so far, the "Penicillium" of "penicillin" sold in pharmacies is just like maggots picked out of a dung tank and sealed in a bottle for sale. Maggots are also "manufactured" by God, not "artificial."

Probably since last year, many scientists have been working in chemical laboratories, trying to directly "manufacture" penicillin using synthetic chemical methods. This summer, I remember seeing in some English science magazine that a scientist had discovered a clue to manufacturing Penicillium using a synthetic method. If successful, "penicillin" would not need to be cultured in a culture solution and extracted from the culture solution, and the price would definitely be greatly reduced.

If the original telegram on the 7th said that the "synthetic" manufacturing method was successful, then our translation of the telegram should not omit the word "synthetic." If not, and the original intention was just to say that there is a new method to culture or extract it, then the word "artificial" seems inappropriate. Because if artificially synthesized penicillin has really been successfully researched, it will definitely be listed as one of the major inventions of the year.

Cowhide with beef is natural cowhide. The leather made through the leather-making process for leather shoes is just "leather processing." Only "artificial leather," which is made by mixing and compounding paper pulp, plastics, and hard fillers under high pressure like Germany used to do, is the real "artificial."

Another example: In the past, sex hormone preparations were extracted from the urine of pregnant women, animal ovaries, and animal testicles, but new "synthetic" or "artificial" hormones are "synthesized" by chemists in test tubes. Both are sold on the market.

"Synthetic chemistry" is the darling of modern chemistry. At first, chemists magically synthesized "organic" urea from "inorganic" drugs in test tubes. This is a major event in modern chemical history.

I hope that my above guess is wrong. If it is really "a thousand thoughts of a fool," then I just want to reiterate the suggestion at the end of the previous short article: journalists should divide their work. This is not a joke but something I have personally seen: a translator who can fluently translate Churchill's speech translated "submarine base" as "undersea stronghold"!

### Skimming is Corruption

— Ke Rong

From the American perspective, "skimming" is almost a universal phenomenon among the Chinese people. The following is a satirical description:

"Chinese people like to skim. When buying things for friends, they always take at least ten percent as a commission."

It's so common for tram conductors to "skim" that it's no longer surprising!

I remember the sensational case of the gold brick theft by a custodian, who indulged in extravagant pleasures. To him, it was just a momentary lapse, a thought of using the money temporarily. Who would willingly walk into the legal net? In reality, it wouldn't be wrong to say he was "skimming."

Recently, Wu Suiren, a senior staff member of the China Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA), illegally used 2.7 billion yuan of CRRRA funds to make high-interest loans. I'm not acting as a pro bono lawyer for the guy. In principle, keeping that 2.7 billion yuan locked in an iron box is pointless. Why not use it for circulation and loan it out at a 20% interest rate, adding 54 million yuan to the monthly income? What's not to like? In the current stage where advanced electronic calculators can't beat the old Chinese abacus, I can't help but admire the Chinese abacus!

I've described the above serious corruption case as a lighthearted "skimming." "Corruption" can be considered "skimming," so why can't "skimming" be considered "corruption?" It's just that "skimming" is small, and "corruption" is big. "Skimming" and "corruption" are like fifty steps versus a hundred steps – the errors committed are the same.

I hope that this special Chinese characteristic of enjoying "skimming" won't be imitated by those above and below, becoming a continuous cycle. Officials skimming from soldiers, officials skimming from the people – this bad habit should be completely eradicated. Otherwise, I really can't bear to say it!

### An Open Letter

— Ji Shuijin

(Editor's Note: Many readers have responded to Mr. Ji Shui's proposal for occupational insurance. This publication has received many letters expressing opinions on this matter, and many letters are to be forwarded to Mr. Ji Shui, which this publication has done. We have now received a letter from Mr. Ji Shui, stating that this movement has already begun. The following is his open letter.)

Friends,

Dear ones, I have a very fun, not-too-big, not-too-small thing to tell you. Do you want to hear it?

First, I must ask you two questions. First, do you have a lot of property at home? Second, do you have any close relatives who are serving as chiefs or directors? If you have neither a great deal of property nor any relatives who are chiefs or directors, I think you will agree with what I am about to tell you.

What I want to tell you is the "promotion of occupational insurance" that I have shouted twice. We are people who do what we say. The work of "occupational insurance" has already begun to be implemented. A dozen of us, some familiar and some new friends, are saving two yuan each month, calculated based on the cost of living index, and preparing to deposit it in a reputable bank to earn interest. If any of us dozen friends become unemployed, we will immediately introduce them to a job that can help them and their families. But our foundation is too fragile now, and we will only temporarily delay providing relief to friends who have not yet fulfilled their obligations. If our new friends increase day by day, and our savings also increase day by day, in addition to the original introduction and relief work, we will also run a cooperative society – a mixed cooperative society integrating production, credit, consumption, and construction. We will use our own funds to build houses for our friends to live in, use our own funds to run small factories and farms to provide work for friends who truly cannot find a job, use our own funds to provide credit for our friends to manage their finances, and use our own funds to operate consumption cooperatives to reduce the exploitation of merchants.

Friends, do you believe my words?

Friends, have you heard the story of the battleship "America's Young Children"? If you believe that story, then you will surely believe my words.

### How to Cooperate

— You Guang

Regarding "occupational insurance," it is almost universally implemented in advanced countries. In the Soviet Union, it is called "social insurance." This undertaking is sponsored by the country. Last year, the Soviet government allocated 110 billion rubles in its budget to promote this undertaking. In the fourth five-year plan, 616 billion rubles were estimated to be spent on "social insurance." This undertaking is also highly valued in socialist countries. But capitalist countries, such as the United States and Britain, are also vigorously promoting it.

"Occupational insurance," as the name suggests, is a kind of guarantee for your and my occupation. But this is not a guarantee for your and my current occupation, but rather a guarantee that you and I will not be afraid of unemployment in the future. In other words, when you or I become unemployed in the future, we can obtain a job. However, this requires everyone to have a common cooperative foundation in advance.

We must first widely seek comrades and start by having those who are employed participate in the organization, and then promote it to those who are unemployed, so that they can also participate in the cooperation.

For example, we establish an ×× occupational insurance company and solicit members. After each member joins this cooperative company, he is a shareholder or a beneficiary of the company, and they can obtain the rights and guarantees they deserve.

For example, now you want to join this organization as a member. You should first fill out the various forms given to you honestly. It is to investigate your skills, occupational interests, family situation, and monthly income and expenditure, because in the future, when you are unemployed and need relief, the company will provide relief or introduce you to a suitable job according to the forms you filled out. Therefore, when you fill out the form, you should not exaggerate or conceal anything. Since the company has such a major responsibility for your future needs and job introductions, then you must pay the company a few percent of each person's monthly income as specified by the company each month. The company will first gather these funds as a fund. This is the member's obligation.

After the member has fulfilled his due obligations, he can enjoy the following rights in the future:

Once you are unemployed, the company will immediately solve the problem of finding a job for you or ensure your livelihood.

The company deposits all the membership fees paid by the members in the bank. If this company has 20,000 members, each person has to pay an average of 20,000 yuan per month, so the total income is 400 million yuan, and after one year, it will be 4.8 billion yuan, not including interest.

The company uses this money to engage in many socially beneficial production activities, such as establishing stores that supply affordable goods (not officially priced goods, but truly affordable goods with no pure profit), running schools, building residential areas, and establishing farms, etc.

The above is just an outline. If we want to do it, we still have to plan it in detail. As long as everyone has a positive mindset, this proposal is not just talk!
