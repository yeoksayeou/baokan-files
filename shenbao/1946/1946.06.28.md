### Three-Man Committee Continues Off-Committee Negotiations, Marshall Visited the Chairman Yesterday for a Long Talk, Third Party Efforts to Mediate

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] After learning of the CCP's counter-proposal to the military reorganization plan, Special Envoy Marshall visited Chairman Chiang this morning for consultations, which lasted for three hours. In the afternoon, Zhou Enlai visited Marshall twice, the first time from 1:30 PM to 4:00 PM and the second time from 6:00 PM to 9:00 PM. The content of the talks was still focused on finding a compromise between the opinions of the government and the CCP. According to informed sources, the government cannot accept the CCP's counter-proposal, and the CCP cannot agree to the government's plan. The gap between the two sides' opinions is still wide, so the current focus remains on off-committee negotiations. With only two and a half days left until the ceasefire deadline, if off-committee negotiations are successful, the formal meeting will only take a few hours to complete. People in Nanjing are showing anxiety about the repeated adjournments of the Military Three-Man Committee, but qualified observers generally believe that the two sides can be brought closer to each other's opinions before the weekend, and there is still a possibility that the overall situation will improve.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] The Third Party, feeling the imminent expiration of the ceasefire deadline, is rushing to mediate. At 3:00 PM today, discussions were held at Lanjiazhuang. In addition to representatives of the Democratic League, Mo Dehui and Chen Qi were also present. The talks ended at 6:00 PM. The content of the talks covered general issues, but the main focus was on hoping that both sides could make more concessions on their military reorganization proposals, so that the three issues discussed during the ceasefire period could be resolved satisfactorily. The Third Party also plans to schedule another meeting with government representatives tomorrow to promote the convergence of opinions between the two sides, and is also considering continuing to meet with Special Envoy Marshall to exchange views.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] The Military Three-Man Committee will continue to adjourn tomorrow. This news was released at 11:00 PM tonight.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] According to a certain authoritative source, the government's recently proposed new military reorganization plan is based on repeated concessions and revisions. The government has made great efforts in designating the garrison areas for the Communist troops inside and outside the Guannei. Although it has not been confirmed that the government is demanding that the CCP abandon Harbin, Qiqihar, Andong, and six other garrison areas in the Northeast, and abandon Rehe, Jiaodong, and the three strategic areas of northern Jiangsu in Guannei, the people in the above-mentioned provinces and regions have expressed dissatisfaction. The Communist Party should take this as a warning and not further burden the people and seize land, trust in power and forget justice, and bring the country to a point of no return. Also, it is reported that off-committee activities of the Military Three-Man Committee will end tomorrow. If there are results by then in the morning, there is a possibility of holding a meeting in the afternoon.

### The CCP's Counter-Proposal for Military Reorganization Is Far From the Topic

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] According to sources, the CCP's counter-proposal to the government's military reorganization plan includes the following three principles: (1) Using politics to control the military, ensuring people's freedom, government democracy, and rural reform; (2) Joint military-civilian governance, with the garrison areas of both sides' troops concentrated in spots rather than scattered over a wide area, concentrating troops in large cities so that villages can expedite their post-war recovery, with the military not interfering in civil administration to avoid the crisis of civil war; (3) Military orders, military administration, and military training should be unified under public management, with unit commanders only responsible for training, and specialized organizational institutions for logistics and supply. Military orders should be uniformly commanded by the reorganized National Government Committee. After the CCP's above-mentioned military reorganization counter-proposal was released, according to a certain neutral source, if the content of the CCP's military reorganization counter-proposal is as described above, then what it says is far from the topic. With only three days left until the final ceasefire deadline, the CCP has not yet put forward correct and reasonable opinions on practical issues that urgently need to be resolved in the military reorganization issue, such as the issue of CCP troop garrison areas, but is merely engaging in beautiful and pleasing rhetoric to deceive the world. Its intention is obviously to "delay." Looking at the first point of the CCP's countermeasure, the so-called "guaranteeing people's freedom," and the second point, the so-called "concentrating troops in major cities so that villages can expedite their post-war recovery," its words are very good, but if the CCP does not turn over a new leaf and thoroughly correct its past mistakes, then the people in the CCP-occupied areas will never have freedom to speak of, and the villages in the CCP-occupied areas will not know when they will be able to recover. As for the third point of the CCP's counter-proposal, saying that military orders should be left to be discussed when the government is reorganized in the future, dragging this into today's negotiations on reorganizing and unifying the army, who would believe that it is not setting up excuses to delay?

[United Press, Nanjing, 27th] The Xinminbao reported today that the CCP side proposed a counter-proposal to the CCP's supplementary military reorganization proposal yesterday afternoon, which does not include new demands to expand the garrison in the Northeast.

### Letter to Compatriots from the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Group, Demanding that the Communist Party Lay Down Their Arms and Hoping that the Democratic League Will Not Be a Tail

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] The Northern Jiangsu Refugee Homecoming Petition Group recently released a letter to compatriots from all walks of life, appealing to the government, the CCP, society, and compatriots from all walks of life, and putting forward the following demands: (1) The government has the responsibility to protect the people's bodies, property, beliefs, and freedom of residence. We demand immediate return to our hometowns, and demand that the government guarantee our return and guarantee our peaceful and prosperous lives in the future; (2) Political disputes should be resolved politically, but party regimes cannot be used as knives and the common people as meat on the chopping board. We demand that the Communist Party immediately lay down their arms, remove the Communist regime in northern Jiangsu, and immediately declare that they will no longer infringe upon the people's legitimate freedom through illegal means such as struggle, liquidation of the masses, trials, forced conscription, forced comforting, forced donation of money and grain, etc.; (3) We hope that the Democratic League will not speak up for the Communist Party and act as its tail in order to gain political status; (4) We hope that Special Envoy Marshall will not look at the Chinese Communist Party with the eyes of an American political party, because the CCP's behavior endangers the country and constitutes treason, and killing people and demolishing houses constitutes theft and banditry; (5) When the government, political parties, etc., cannot fulfill their responsibility to protect the people, the people have the right to arm themselves for freedom, and must have freedom. In the future, the exiles in northern Jiangsu will, within the scope of small laws, carry out the most effective homecoming and self-help actions.

### Authoritative Sources in the Judiciary Discussed the Application of the Amnesty Case, with Approximately 700,000 Criminals in Prisons Nationwide

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] After the amnesty case was passed by the Legislative Yuan, a reporter recently visited the content of the amnesty case passed by the Judicial Yuan. It can be said that it is quite lenient to general civil and criminal offenders, but it obviously shows no leniency towards war criminals, traitors, corruption, and drug offenders. After all, amnesty is a national grand ceremony. Although the law is nothing more than human feelings, reasonable application should be the case. According to the various clauses of non-amnesty or reduced sentences listed in item B of the case, all traitors are on the list of non-amnesty or reduction. Only those who conceal and fail to report, or who harbor and condone, and those who deliberately misreport, can apply the amnesty and reduction measures. Those who take bribes are also on the list of non-amnesty and reduction, and those who offer bribes can apply the amnesty and reduction measures. Only drug addicts can use the amnesty and reduction measures, but those who commit the crime a second time are not applicable. According to general estimates, there are currently approximately 700,000 military and civilian criminals in prisons nationwide. After the amnesty order is issued, it is hoped that approximately three-fifths of them will be able to regain their freedom through the grace of the national grand ceremony.

### Regarding the Unfortunate Incident in Xiaguan: Six Suspects Sent to Court, Cheng Qiong Tearfully Tells Reporters of Communist Army's Atrocities

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] On the evening of the 23rd, an unfortunate incident occurred in Xiaguan. Eight suspects were arrested on the spot by the Xiaguan Military Police. Except for two of them who were released on bail after interrogation because they were not involved in the beating, the remaining Cheng Qiong, Lu Hong, Yan Yiping, Chen Xishi, Wang Minghua, and Tang Shuhua were escorted to the Military Law Office of the Military Police Headquarters by the Xiaguan Military Police on the night of the 25th. On the afternoon of the 26th, a reporter visited the Military Law Office of the Military Police Headquarters to interview these six people suspected of assault. The following are their statements to the reporter:

Wang Minghua: "He claimed" to be from Yangzhou, Jiangsu, 29 years old, currently living at No. 5 Xianyu Lane, Xiaguan. He works as a measuring clerk at the Ganhexiang Rice Store. After dinner on the 23rd, he went out for a stroll alone. On the way, he heard people talking about the communists from Shanghai giving speeches at the station. Driven by curiosity, he squeezed into the station to watch. It was probably a little after 11 o'clock. He saw many people crowding and shouting to beat the communists. Because he usually hated the communists, he thought they deserved to be beaten, so he shouted along. He was arrested by the military police. He did not beat anyone and did not even see a representative.

Tang Shuhua: "He claimed" to be from Nanjing, 17 years old, currently studying in the first year of junior high school at Daosheng Middle School, living at No. 25 Mishi Street. After dinner at home, he went out for a walk with four classmates. He heard passersby say that there were many people fighting at Xiaguan Station. He panicked and wanted to turn around and avoid it, but was arrested. The other three companions ran away early. He did not see any representatives at all, nor did he hit anyone. The school will have a major exam tomorrow, and his parents are very worried hearing that he was locked up. "Crying" Please let them get me out soon.

Cheng Qiong: He is from Jiancheng, northern Jiangsu, 30 years old, currently temporarily staying at a friend's place at No. 7 Yongning Lane, Xiaguan. He graduated from a senior elementary school and has been unemployed for nearly half a year. In his hometown of Jiancheng, he owned more than 30 mu of land, and his family of seven lived by farming, living a very happy life. Unexpectedly, after Jiancheng was occupied by the New Fourth Army, the situation became very different. They divided Jiancheng into four new counties: Sheyang, Jiancheng, Jianyang, and Jiandong. Your own land would be "struggled against" and given to their county government. Your farming tools had to be taken out for public use. Your wives and sisters had to join the women's team and let the New Fourth Army "struggle against" them. Any literate young people who did not obey them were called "stubborn elements" or "national spies," and they were also "struggled against." He was arrested by the New Fourth Army last October and participated in a model class. He didn't know the situation of the model class at that time. He heard people say that after training, the model class would be formed into a main force. He thought that after eight years of resistance against Japan, it was not easy to defeat Japan. Why should he fight the National Army? Chinese people fighting Chinese people. He decided not to do it, so he asked three local bailiffs to bail him out, willing to farm and help the backstage government to "struggle against" the land of self-cultivating farmers. After leaving the model class, he learned that his family's more than 30 mu of land had been completely "struggled against." He couldn't live in his hometown at all, so he ran away secretly from his family. He went to Shanghai at the end of the year, but couldn't find a job. He went to Wuxi this April and came to Nanjing on June 12 to borrow money from friends. On the afternoon of the 23rd, he was at his residence in Xiaguan. Passing by the station, he heard people say that the communists were coming. He went into the station to take a look. He saw many fellow villagers petitioning the communist representatives. He also went to petition, because he had been unemployed for so long, all because of the New Fourth Army. Of course, he wanted to petition the communists, hoping they would stop fighting and let them go back. When he squeezed close to the representative, the order became chaotic. He was hit several times on the back, and he also hit randomly, and was arrested. His mother and sisters also ran away after he left. They met in Wuxi and learned that the three bailiffs who bailed him out were being punished because he escaped and they couldn't hand him over. His family property was confiscated. His uncle, in February of this year, because he hated the New Fourth Army to the bone, secretly said to others, "It would be great if the Central Army came." He was secretly reported, so the New Fourth Army stripped him naked, tied him up, and made him kneel on a dirt platform one or two zhang high, telling him to "look at the Central Government." After kneeling for a day and a night, they buried him alive at night after taking him down. They cannot go back to their homes now. The Communist Party kills and sets fires, rapes and ravishes the wives and sisters of good people. The state doesn't care. They just hit the communists a few times who deserved to die, and they are breaking the law and facing lawsuits. He hopes the reporters go to Jiancheng to take a look. He decided to risk his life to settle accounts with the Communist Party. He was overwhelmed with grief.

Lu Qi: He is from Yingxian County, 18 years old, a first-year student at Daosheng Middle School, living at No. 218 Huanhe Road. After dinner on the evening of the 23rd, he was resting on a deck chair when he heard people shouting on the street that a New Fourth Army representative was giving a speech at the Guan Station. He hurriedly ran over alone. When he arrived, he saw a lot of people crowded. He saw a few people surrounding a person and beating him. He went up to persuade them, but was arrested as a result. He did not see the representative, nor did he hit anyone.

Yan Yiping: He is from Zhenjiang, living at the Henghe Department Store at No. 48 Xianyu Lane, Xiaguan, working as the store's accountant. Because he often went to the train station, he also went that night. He heard many people shouting to beat the communists. Because he hated the communists, he also shouted along and was arrested. He did not hit anyone.

Chen Xishi: He is from Jiancheng, northern Jiangsu, 25 years old, helping his father farm his own 40 mu of land at home, and also attending private school. After the New Fourth Army occupied Jiancheng, they wanted to "struggle against" his family's land. Seeing that the root of his family's livelihood was about to be taken away, he refused to give it to them for struggle, and was shot dead on the spot by the New Fourth Army. Although he wanted to fight them at the time, he didn't have enough strength. Since there was no food to eat at home, he had to flee. He went to Shanghai, but couldn't find a job. He came to Nanjing on the morning of June 23rd to find friends in Pukou. Returning to Xiaguan Station, he saw many people speaking with a northern Jiangsu accent shouting, "The Communist Party should quickly get out of northern Jiangsu!" "We want to go home!" He was moved for a moment, so he squeezed into the crowd and followed them to petition the communist representatives. The representatives never answered. Someone shouted to beat them, so everyone started fighting, and he was arrested as a result. He didn't expect that after just arriving in Nanjing after being displaced, he would face a lawsuit. He doesn't have a single penny on him now, and he doesn't know where his family is. He really doesn't know what to do.

### U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee Passes Military Assistance to China Bill, Term is Ten Years, Submitted to the House

[U.S. News Service, Washington, 26th] The bill on military assistance to China, which was proposed two weeks ago at the request of Secretary of State Byrnes, was passed by the House Foreign Affairs Committee today by a vote of 15 to 2 and submitted to the House of Representatives. The same bill has been introduced in the Senate. Byrnes said: The legislation in this proposal has been fully agreed to by Special Envoy to China, General Marshall. The goal of the bill is to help the Chinese army become a modern armed force so that it can fulfill its obligations under the United Nations Charter. This legislation will stipulate that the term of assistance is ten years.

[United Press, Washington, 26th] The military assistance to China bill passed by the House Foreign Affairs Committee today stipulates that surplus military equipment will be transferred to China, and a U.S. military delegation will be sent to train the Chinese army. Earlier, Acting Secretary of State Acheson reported to the committee that after the implementation of China's military reorganization plan, the current 375 army divisions will be reduced to 60 divisions. The committee passed this bill in a secret meeting today. Republican Congresswoman Bolton expressed her opposition, saying, "If we do not consider this case carefully and vote on it, it will be very harmful to the future of peace."

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] Foreign News: The United States seeks world peace. Even the work of sending Japanese prisoners and Japanese nationals away from China has been completed. If a peaceful, unified, and strong China has not been realized by then, its military assistance to China will only be strengthened, not weakened, and will not abandon its sacred mission of military assistance to China due to communist anti-American propaganda. The anti-American propaganda launched by Yan'an is not only not fooling the Chinese people, but also has little response in the ideological realm of American communists.

### The Capital High Court Publicly Tried the Traitors Lu Ying and Yin Rugeng Yesterday, Former Air Force Colonel Chen Tongxiang Sentenced to Life Imprisonment

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] Lu Ying, the former head of the puppet police bureau who ran rampant in Shanghai during the Anti-Japanese War, was tried in the Capital High Court this morning at 10 o'clock, presided over by Judge Jin Shiding. Lu is from Jiangling, Hubei, 52 years old, and graduated from the second term of the Baoding Military Academy. During the trial, the presiding judge paid special attention to the authority of the puppet police bureau. Lu confessed that the situation in Shanghai was complicated at that time. The public concession, the French concession, and Nanshi all had their own police bureaus. After the puppet government took back the concessions, the mayor concurrently served as the head of the police bureau, and he retreated to the deputy head. He also denied all charges of sheltering gambling dens, selling opium, and publicly bribing. He also argued that he had sent people to Hong Kong to contact Li Wanjun, who assassinated the puppet Foreign Minister Chen Lu in 1941, and rescued him after he was arrested. He also contacted Zhang Huifang's troops of the Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army. He also claimed that at the end of May 1945, he had ordered a police brigade of 500 people to revolt in preparation for acting as guides during the counterattack, and that he had never harmed anti-Japanese personnel. The presiding judge said that what he said was all empty talk without any evidence, and allowed him to state again any events that were beneficial to him. Lu lowered his head and pondered for a long time. Suddenly, with a face full of joy, he claimed that there were also two things he had done: establishing a civilian hospital in Nanjing and raising donations for education. Lu's son, Cheng Bin, hired lawyer Xia Anxiu to defend his father. Lawyer Xia put forward points such as criminal psychology, serving the central government, and the Li Wanjun incident to defend him, and requested a retrial, but it was not approved. The verdict will be announced at 2 pm on July 3. Lu has one wife, two concubines, and seven children. One concubine has already run away.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] Yin Rugeng, the veteran traitor who was escorted to Beijing from Pingjin, was publicly tried by the Capital High Court at 2 pm on the 27th in front of 2,000 spectators. The first courtroom of the High Court once again presented the lively scene of the public trials of the traitors Lin Bosheng and Mei Sipin. Correspondents from Central News Agency, photographers, and broadcasters also gathered. At 3 pm, Judge Zhao Chen, associate judges Ge Zitan and Jin Shiding, and prosecutor Wang Wenjun took the stand. Yin, wearing a lake-colored silk long gown and Chinese-style leather casual shoes, was in the defendant's dock. The lawyers he hired were Ge Shizhao, Duanmu Kai, and Zhang Wenbo, but only Lawyer Zhang arrived today. After asking for his name, age, and place of origin, the prosecutor read out the indictment, detailing Yin's various acts of colluding with the enemy and betraying the country since 1935. The defendant seemed to have difficulty hearing due to his hearing impairment, and he often trembled. The presiding judge then consulted with the prosecutor for a moment on the trial procedure, and then began to investigate the evidence, questioning Yin's origin, education, and the circumstances before and after his betrayal of the country. The defendant initially emphasized that he himself joined the Tongmenghui when he studied in Japan, and his experience of returning to China after the revolution for a second time. Then he explained his involvement in Sino-Japanese diplomacy before 1935. Finally, he argued that his establishment of the Jidong Anti-Communist Autonomous Government was to adapt to the special environment of North China at that time, and at least had obtained the "understanding" of Song Zheyuan, the person in charge of the military and political affairs of North China at that time.

### Ban on "Yiguan Dao" in Nanjing

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] The Eastern Suburb Police Bureau recently discovered a "Yiguan Dao" organization in the Tangshan District, which has been placed under the jurisdiction of the city, and immediately banned it. The address at No. 149 Tangquan Road in the district was originally the site of the Muen Church of Jesus, which was burned down by the enemy during the war. In June 1943, local residents Zhang Jinliang and others initiated the establishment of "Yiguan Dao," with Zhang himself as the leader. The houses were built with funds from the members. After the victory, the government ordered the prohibition of enemy and puppet remnants. So they dare not to public activities. After the Eastern Suburb Police Bureau learned of this, in order to eradicate the evil religion, they went to investigate with the local chief Tang Zhaoming and found a number of "Yiguan Dao" Buddhist books. They ordered Zhang Jinliang to vacate the house, which was temporarily kept by the police bureau, and made a written guarantee to reform himself and no longer set up altars and teach secretly to confuse the masses.

### Editorial: Starting with Sino-American Agricultural Cooperation

The U.S. delegation of the Sino-American Agricultural Technology Cooperation Team, led by Dr. Claude B. Hutchison, Dean of the College of Agriculture at the University of California, arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon. They will soon delve into rural areas throughout the country for a six-month study and investigation. Then, they will prescribe remedies tailored to the situation, proposing concrete reform plans for improving our country's agricultural policies and technology, as well as increasing and promoting exports of agricultural products, for our government to adopt. At this time when our country's rural areas are on the brink of bankruptcy, we truly hold unlimited expectations for the arrival of the American agricultural delegation and express our utmost welcome.

China is founded on agriculture, with 80% of the national population being farmers, but the mode of production remains in the medieval stage. For decades, it has suffered from repeated natural disasters and man-made calamities, and it is on the verge of bankruptcy. The phrases "Disasters and famines reported in 19 provinces across the country, 30 million people starving" are insufficient to describe the gloomy faces of Chinese farmers today. Only by delving deep into the countryside and witnessing firsthand can one fully understand that the collapse of China's rural economy has indeed reached a critical juncture. Taking just grain as an example, China, known for its vast land and abundant resources, cannot even be self-sufficient. In addition to requesting 400,000 tons of rice and 700,000 tons of wheat from the UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, it has also tried to purchase and transport rice and wheat from Brazil, Argentina, Siam, and Vietnam to supplement the people's food supply. Not to mention other necessities. As for the major exports before the war, such as tea, silk, tung oil, pig bristles, fur, and soybeans, production has not only sharply declined recently, but also, due to transportation blockages and high wages, the cost is too high, and domestic prices are far above those abroad, making exports practically impossible. If this situation is allowed to continue, rural bankruptcy will be unavoidable, and there will be no way to discuss the great task of national construction and revitalization. This newspaper's editorials have repeatedly pointed out that industrial construction should start with the construction of agriculture and the stability of rural areas, and that China's industrialization should first industrialize agriculture. The American agricultural delegation's visit to China this time consists of experienced experts who bear the important task of assisting China in building agriculture. This is sufficient to prove that the U.S. government is indeed sincere in assisting China's national construction and revitalization. We, representing the poor and helpless Chinese farmers, not only express our joy, but also deeply wish to do our best to accept the guidance of American experts.

The reasons for the bankruptcy of Chinese rural areas are truly numerous, but the most important is still the destruction caused by man-made disasters. For example, after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the Communist Party, in order to expand its territory, spread throughout the countryside, blockaded cities, destroyed transportation, and launched a civil war, causing unrest and unease in rural areas throughout the country. In the so-called "liberated areas" occupied by the Communist army, not only were those they regarded as landlords subjected to severe torture, but even ordinary, law-abiding, and well-behaved tenant farmers were often unable to survive. Today, south of the Yangtze River, displaced and homeless, many pitiful and helpless refugees from northern Jiangsu Province are a clear example. Therefore, to save the rural areas from bankruptcy, in addition to technological reforms, stabilizing the rural areas requires even more effort. How can rural areas be stabilized? The cessation of conflict, restoration of transportation, and reorganization and unification of the armed forces, as indicated in the government's ceasefire order, must be agreed upon and thoroughly implemented by the end of this month. In other words, only by truly achieving peaceful unification can there be hope. According to a United Press dispatch the day before yesterday, the U.S. military aid bill for China has been passed by the House Foreign Affairs Committee by a vote of 15 to 2. It is no longer a question that this bill will be established and implemented in the future. Special Envoy Marshall has sent a telegram to the State Department, strongly advocating that the United States continue to provide military assistance to China in order to maintain China's unity and stability. This is the most far-sighted measure. We also believe that the passage of this bill by the United States will surely promote the early restoration of stability in Chinese rural areas and accelerate efforts toward production. Because if the Chinese army is not reorganized and reduced in size, there is no way to restore the productivity of rural areas.

From this, it can be seen that the United States, on the one hand, is economically assisting China in improving agriculture to alleviate the suffering of the majority of Chinese people. On the other hand, it is also militarily assisting China in reducing the size of its army to maintain domestic unity and stability, using a two-pronged approach, hoping that China can embark on the road to revitalization in the shortest possible time. The people of our country, in addition to gratitude, can only work harder to build and not be ashamed of the efforts and goodwill of the American ally. However, Mao Zedong publicly issued anti-American remarks in Yan'an, demanding that the United States immediately cease aid to China and withdraw American troops stationed in China as soon as possible. He even slandered "American aid to China as creating civil war in China, plunging China into division, chaos, terror, and poverty." It is truly unknown why he would hallucinate to this extent. Under the orders of Yan'an, Communist parties in various places are vigorously posting anti-American slogans, and in Shanghai, there have been repeated incidents of assaulting U.S. military personnel, plotting to create anti-American incidents similar to the "Boxer Rebellion." The Communist Party's approach is nothing more than to incite anti-American sentiment among ignorant and foolish people, indirectly causing people in the United States who do not understand the political situation in China to rise up and demand that the government no longer interfere in China's affairs. If their trick succeeds, not only will China be harmed, but world peace will also be affected. Amidst the arrival of the American agricultural delegation, we should be highly vigilant against the Communist Party's insidious propaganda.

What the Chinese people have been seeking day and night after the war is national peace, unity, and prosperity. What the American government and people hope for China is also peace, unity, and prosperity. The reason why the American government and people are like this is not only for the common interests of China and the United States, but also because the United States believes that only when a strong, united, and democratic China is established in the Far East can it be hoped that China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union can truly cooperate hand in hand in the Far East and lay the foundation for peace. If China cannot be democratic, unified, and strong, China has the possibility of becoming a battlefield for the Third World War. And this is precisely what both the Chinese and Americans do not want to see happen. Therefore, American aid to China and China's willingness to accept American aid are both for the sake of overall world peace. In the United States, it is not aggression, and in China, it is not dependence. In any exchanges between China and the United States, we must, like the agricultural cooperation team, never forget the word "cooperation." Only equality can lead to cooperation, and only cooperation can lead to friendship. The thorough cooperation between China and the United States is purely out of the genuine friendship of both sides, and it is not limited to agricultural technology cooperation alone.

### Local dispatches: UNRRA Experts Lead Technicians to Eradicate Locust Plague in Eastern Tianjin; Over 280 Million Locusts Killed in One Week

[Special Dispatch from Tianjin] Locust swarms are wreaking havoc in the eastern Tianjin area, and farmland within 70 square miles nearby has suffered from the locust plague, resulting in severe losses. Upon hearing the news last week, the Executive Headquarters Branch immediately allocated 20 large barrels of potent insecticide to the disaster-stricken areas. Mr. Teo, a UNRRA expert, along with technicians from the Peiping Agricultural Experiment Station of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, led many enthusiastic agricultural students to rush to the locust-infested areas to fight the plague. Scientific agents possess great power. After a week of effort, the majority of the locust swarms have been killed. Calculating the number of locusts killed by weight, it reaches over 288 million. In order to coordinate relief and locust eradication, the Executive Headquarters Branch has transported 112,000 pounds of flour to the locust-stricken areas to organize work relief. One pound of flour is issued for every five pounds of locusts or locust eggs captured and killed. The general populace is extremely interested in the locust reduction efforts, it is said.

### Soviet Representative Proposes New Suggestion; Trieste Question Reaches Impasse; Sovereignty Jointly Owned by Italy and Yugoslavia; Byrnes Expresses Clear Opposition

[News Agency Report] London, 27th Broadcast: Today's meeting of the Four Foreign Ministers continued to discuss the Trieste issue without result and has encountered a new crisis. After Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov put forward what he called a "major concession" proposal, it has been opposed by U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes. The so-called "major concession" proposal includes two points: (1) The Allies should recognize the new Italo-Yugoslav border west of Trieste; (2) The sovereignty of Trieste should belong to both Italy and Yugoslavia, with each side appointing a governor. Byrnes completely opposed this proposal, believing that the issue should be handled by the 21-nation peace conference.

[Reuters, Paris, 26th] It has been learned from authoritative sources that the Four Foreign Ministers, at the request of Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky, will hold a special informal meeting at 9:45 PM tonight (6:45 AM Shanghai time on the 27th) to discuss the Italian question, especially the Trieste issue. This agency's diplomatic reporter believes that this special meeting can be regarded as the turning point for the success or failure of the Foreign Ministers' meeting. The Soviet Union's initiation of this discussion indicates that it will put forward a new proposal in order to continue the discussions. However, some observers are unwilling to make any judgments before knowing whether its motive is to genuinely compromise or merely to reiterate its original position. During the Foreign Ministers' meeting this afternoon, the British proposal on the free navigation of the Danube River was temporarily shelved to allow Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov time to study it. British Foreign Secretary Bevin had proposed that all countries could have freedom of commercial navigation on the Danube River and its tributaries.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 26th] The Four Foreign Ministers, at the request of Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, held a secret meeting at the Luxembourg Palace at 9:45 PM this evening. The Four Foreign Ministers have only been discussing minor economic issues for several days. Now the "General Assembly" has begun, and important issues such as the peace treaty with Italy and the Trieste issue will be submitted for discussion. It is generally believed that the Soviet delegation would not request a special meeting without special proposals. The "instructions" from Moscow must have arrived here and are being implemented by the United delegation. However, one thing may dilute the optimistic outlook: the two major barriers that have formed have insisted on not giving way on various fundamental issues until now. It is unknown whether they can be fully broken.

### Czechoslovakia Supports Yugoslavia; Opposes Trieste Being Under International Co-Governance

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 26th] The Czech government has sent a memorandum to the Four Foreign Ministers' meeting, requesting that the port of Trieste be returned to Yugoslavia. It emphasizes that if the port is under international co-governance, it will inevitably cause various inconveniences, will not improve port operations, and will not alleviate ethnic conflicts. It will also be difficult for countries wishing to use the port to transport goods to seek guarantees for free access. Therefore, the Czech government believes that any solution that separates the port from Yugoslavia cannot be reconciled with the interests of the port and Czechoslovakia, and it will also greatly hinder Central European trade and economic development.

### Disposition of Italy's Former Colonies Resolved

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 26th] The Italian African Colonies Committee, established by the Four Foreign Ministers' meeting and responsible for drafting articles in accordance with the decisions of the Foreign Ministers' meeting, held its first meeting here today. According to the Foreign Ministers' meeting, three resolutions have been passed regarding the disposition of Italy's former colonies: (1) The peace treaty with Italy should have a clause stipulating that Italy should renounce its rights to its African colonies; (2) The Four Powers should decide on the legal status of these colonies within one year; (3) If a disposal method cannot be agreed upon within one year, the issue should be submitted to the United Nations for handling.

The first task is to draft a constitution in accordance with the wishes expressed by the people in the general election. The creed it holds is the spirit of the anti-enemy movement during the war, but the anti-enemy movement is only the first chapter of the opening statement, and the entire work remains to be completed. General de Gaulle is the soul of national rejuvenation, and all our countrymen have benefited from it. The government's urgent task at present is to solve the problem of raising wages. A national economic conference will be convened soon, and representatives from all owners, workers, and technicians will participate.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 26th] The National Constituent Assembly recently passed a motion of confidence in the new government by an overwhelming majority of 517 votes to 4.

### The United States Should No Longer; Appease the Soviet Union; Advocates Promoting a Meeting Between the Two Heads of State; U.S. Congressional Delegation to Europe Issues Report

[United Press, Washington, 26th] The report compiled by the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee, which visited Europe last autumn, was released today. It firmly advocates that the United States no longer adopt a policy of appeasement towards the Soviet Union. The main points are as follows: (1) Abandon all appeasement measures towards the Soviet Union; (2) Promote relations with governments and peoples who are friendly to the United States; (3) Encourage the exchange of people and products between the United States and the Soviet Union; (4) Adhere to the principle of reciprocity. If the United States is not allowed to conduct political activities in the Soviet Union, then the Soviet Union should not be allowed to conduct political activities in the United States; (5) Expedite a meeting between Chairman Stalin and President Truman to prevent the Soviet Union from doubting the purposes and intentions of the United States; (6) Insist on holding free elections in Poland and adopt some method to maintain the output of the Ruhr region.

### Soviet Representative to the Security Council; Exercises Veto Again; Spanish Question Retained on Agenda

[Central News Agency, New York, 26th Special Dispatch] The United Nations Security Council today agreed to include the Spanish question on the agenda. Today's Security Council meeting listened to the results of the report from the drafting committee composed of Britain, Australia, and Poland. The opinions of Britain and Australia were quite different from those of Poland. The draft resolution proposed by Britain and Australia seeks to ensure that the Security Council's actions do not hinder the UN General Assembly's discussion of the Spanish question in September. The draft resolution proposed by Poland made a strong attack on the Franco regime and explicitly stipulated that September 1 should be the date for the Security Council to raise the Spanish question for discussion again. The Soviet Union immediately expressed its support for the Polish proposal, but as a result, the British and Australian proposal was passed by a vote of 9 to 2. Subsequently, Soviet Representative Gromyko immediately declared that this proposal was a matter of substance rather than procedure, so his vote against it should be regarded as a veto. After a heated debate, the result was that the proposal was finally considered a matter of procedure by a vote of 8 to 2, so the veto power should not be applicable. Afterwards, the proposal was voted on sentence by sentence for the second time, and both sides agreed that the Security Council should continue to pay attention to the Franco regime.

### Iranian Communist Party Conspiracy Uncovered

[United Press, Tehran, 26th] According to well-informed diplomatic sources, the conspiracy of the Iranian Communist Party extremists, dissatisfied with Governor Pishevari of Azerbaijan Province (formerly the Prime Minister of the autonomous government), to imprison him has been uncovered. Thirty conspirators have been arrested and imprisoned, but some of the most important figures, who were prominent figures during the era of Azerbaijan's independence, have not been apprehended.

The situation in Tabriz is tense.

### Protagonist of the Axis Alliance; Matsuoka Yosuke Dies of Illness; Japan's Warmongering Diplomat Ends His Life This Way; Leaves Poem Saying "No Blaming Heaven, No Resenting Others"

[United Press, Tokyo, 27th] The International Tribunal announced today that former Japanese Foreign Minister and war criminal Matsuoka Yosuke has died of tuberculosis at the University of Tokyo Hospital at the age of 66. Presiding Judge Webb announced that the name of defendant Matsuoka would be deleted from the indictment and that all charges against him would be dropped. The court approved the request of the defendant's lawyer Warren and ordered that the body be handed over to his family. Matsuoka had been discharged from prison for about a month of convalescence before passing away today. Matsuoka was once active on the international diplomatic stage, signing alliance anti-communist treaties with the Axis powers and concluding a neutrality friendship treaty with the Soviet Union. He was prominent for a time. At the time of his death, only his wife and his 35-year-old eldest son were by his side. According to his son, Matsuoka knew he was about to die and often murmured to himself, "I regret my death." Before entering prison, he wrote a poem for his family, the translation of which is as follows: "No blaming Heaven, no resenting others, I walk down the dark road". Matsuoka first fell ill in July 1941 when he returned from Moscow after signing a neutrality treaty with the Soviet Union. Matsuoka claimed that Japan urgently needed to "launch a genuine revolution to curb the arrogance of the warlords" in 1940. When the warlords were in power, a war with the United States was inevitable. The only way to save the situation was through revolution. The Tripartite Pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan, which he personally negotiated, was also intended to be used to pressure the United States to recognize the difficulty of fighting and thus move towards peace. He had spent a long time in the United States during his life, so he often had pro-American tendencies.

### Continued War Criminal Trials - Testimony from Inukai Ken Regarding the Assassination of His Father

Testimony Regarding the Assassination of His Father

[United Press, Tokyo, 27th] The International Military Tribunal for the Far East continued the trial of Japanese war criminals today. Fujita, a former newspaper president, testified that the 27th defendant, Hashimoto Kingoro, had advocated for aggressive action in Manchuria. Fujita recounted that in August 1931, Hashimoto had discussed the situation in Manchuria with Staff Officer Shigeno, and its "endangering of Japanese rights and people." Between the 10th and 15th, Shigeno brought 40,000 yen to Fujita's home to be held for immediate use, and a few days later took away 20,000 yen. After the September 18th Incident, Shigeno said that the Kwantung Army would drive Zhang Xueliang out of the Three Eastern Provinces, and if it failed, he would commit seppuku. Fujita testified yesterday that Hashimoto was a key figure in the March 1931 coup. Hashimoto was the commander of Japanese forces in Nanjing when the U.S. gunboat Panay and the British gunboat Ladybird were shelled. Inukai Ken, son of Inukai Tsuyoshi, then testified that his father opposed Japanese aggression in the Three Eastern Provinces. Several months after the September 18th Incident, he visited the Emperor to request an imperial edict ordering the withdrawal of Japanese troops, but his request was not granted. At the time, his father was Prime Minister and Inukai Ken served as his secretary, as well as being a member of the Diet. His father opposed the recognition of the puppet state of Manchukuo, believing it violated Chinese sovereignty. His father was a close friend of Sun Yat-sen, the father of the Chinese Republic, and they frequented each other in Tokyo. In an effort to resolve the Manchurian problem, he secretly sent a representative to Nanjing to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. Because of his opposition to aggression and reduction of the military budget, he offended the military cliques. The Minister of the Army at the time was Araki Sadao, who is also now listed as a defendant. His father later gave an anti-military clique speech in Yokohama, denouncing fascism, and a week later was assassinated at his official residence by naval officers. However, it is noteworthy that during the cross-examination of the witness, the defendant's lawyers did not mention Inukai Tsuyoshi's visit to the Emperor, indicating that the defendant's lawyers did not want any witness to attribute the Japanese military's wartime actions to the Emperor. Recently, Tojo Hideki declared to a United Press reporter that he was pleased that Chief Prosecutor Keenan had stated that the Emperor should not be prosecuted as a war criminal, expressing the general hope of the Japanese people that the responsibility of the military clique era not be attributed to the Imperial Court.

General Zhu Shimin Makes a Suggestion

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 26th Dispatch] Some members of the Allied Council for Japan suggested to the Allied Headquarters this morning that when the Japanese government disposes of its assets, it should not include machinery that can be used for reparations.

### The Power of an Atomic Bomb Explosion May Cause Earthquakes; Climate May Also Change – The Speculation of Seismologist Stroff

[United Press, San Francisco, 26th] The last batch of ships participating in the atomic bomb test at Bikini Atoll on July 1st sailed from here last week. Seismologist Stroff issued a warning today, saying: "I fear that no one will survive the test to report the test situation. The world's climate may also change as a result, and it will be difficult to recover for decades." The ships that sailed from here last week included the USS Panamint, carrying representatives from the U.S. Congress, various Allied nations, and the scientific community; the USS Blue Ridge, carrying military observers; and the news ship USS Appalacian, carrying reporters from various newspapers, radio stations, and magazines. They will arrive at Bikini one or two days before July 1st. The first atomic bomb is scheduled to be dropped on July 1st, and the second atomic bomb is scheduled to explode in the lagoon of the atoll on July 20th. Stroff's warning stems from this second bomb and was published in an article in "Scientific Community," speculating on the extreme dangers that could be caused during the test.

Earth's Crust Could Be Split

According to Stroff's calculations, the force required to split the Earth's crust into two halves, forty miles deep and three meters wide, would be unimaginable, approximately 29 orders of magnitude in ergs (absolute unit of work). The power generated by an atomic bomb is surprisingly similar to this, only two orders of magnitude less. Stroff's estimates are based on the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, which was only half the power of the one used in the Bikini test. According to Stroff, the atomic energy generated by nuclear fission at that time would be enough to split the Earth's crust in two, and extreme caution must be exercised when testing larger atomic bombs in the future. Even the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, if exploded on the ocean surface or in the ocean, or if the seismic resistance of Bikini Atoll had been below normal in the previous months, could cause danger, leading to no one surviving to report the test. If the seabed is fractured by the atomic bomb during the test and the cracks are deep enough, the temperature within will inevitably be extremely high, and seawater will flow into the cracks. The steam generated will deepen and widen the cracks, and the resulting steam expansion may cause a tsunami that destroys all ships, both those intended as bombing targets and those not.

Underwater Explosion Causes Danger

Furthermore, if the atomic bomb used in the test is larger than the one dropped on Hiroshima, the range and height of the steam and dust ejected from the seabed may be several times greater than that caused by the eruption of Krakatoa in 1883. If the amount of dust is indeed several times greater than that ejected during the Krakatoa eruption, the world's climate may be affected, causing adverse changes that last for decades. When Krakatoa erupted, it ejected an estimated ten to twenty cubic miles of rubble, and sunlight was cooled by the rubble for several years. Shawyer, the technical scientific director participating in the Bikini test, also made an estimate of the energy generated during the atomic bomb explosion, but Stroff did not mention it in his paper. Shawyer and his colleagues calculated the amount of energy released in the water when an atomic bomb explodes underwater, estimating that it would be about 10% to 50% of the total energy released. The energy that the atomic bomb can cause in underwater earthquakes or volcanic eruptions is limited to this amount. Based on Shawyer's numbers, Stroff's statement that the earth's crust will crack during the test would require two to ten times more atomic energy than he himself calculated. According to Stroff's figures, the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima was actually greater than the San Francisco earthquake.

Flipping a Switch Could Cause an Earthquake

However, according to calculations by atomic energy scientists, the explosive force of an atomic bomb is only one-thousandth to one-ten-thousandth of the seismic force of the San Francisco earthquake. However, the real danger that atomic bomb explosions can cause can be glimpsed from this. Even if the atomic bomb explosion itself is not enough to cause an earthquake, it can still cause a place where an earthquake is likely to occur to erupt, like flipping a switch on a gun. For example, if the rock beneath the spot where the atomic bomb falls is already in a state of detachment, it will inevitably fracture after this shock. This fracturing may be expanded by the influence of natural forces into an earthquake. The reason why Stroff is afraid that if the seismic resistance of Bikini Atoll is low in the months before the experiment, this atomic bomb explosion is very likely to cause an earthquake lies in this, although this "earthquake switch" theory is also highly questionable. Typhoons and giant sea winds sometimes cause earthquakes, which is a fact. These storms can cause strong vibrations on the seabed. Father MacLen of St. Louis has recorded on his seismograph the power of vibrations caused by storms. The energy generated by these vibrations may be even greater than that of an atomic bomb, but it still does not seem sufficient to trigger an earthquake. The first atomic bomb test in Mexico cratered the earth's crust by six feet, with a diameter of about half a mile, which was virtually the same as triggering an earthquake. However, the vibration at the time was still light, and the range was not very wide, and it did not become an "earthquake switch" and trigger a real earthquake.

### Bomb Test Scheduled for July 1st

[Reuters, Washington, 26th] The U.S. Navy Department announced tonight that it has now been decided to drop the atomic bomb at Bikini Atoll at 22:30 Greenwich Mean Time next Sunday (7:30 AM Shanghai time on Monday). This was chosen by meteorologists, who expect the weather to be excellent at that time.

### Severe Punishment Decided for Unscrupulous Merchants Hoarding Rice

Since the city adopted measures for rationing rice, rice prices have gradually stabilized. However, recently some rice merchants have again implemented a "scorched earth" tactic, hoarding rice and refusing to sell it, and black market trading has occurred. The Food Department and the City Government have now agreed on measures to increase the source of rice in the rice market as much as possible, and hope that citizens will expose and report the tricks of unscrupulous merchants hoarding rice. The authorities will severely punish such unscrupulous merchants.

[Another Report] The amount of grain arriving in the city today was relatively small, and some rice stores had no rice to sell. The municipal authorities are paying close attention. It is understood that the municipal grain authorities distributed 2,270 shih of stored grain to 227 rice stores in the city yesterday, 10 shih per store, to supply the market. It is also understood that 1,079 shih, 8 dou, and 6 sheng were actually sold yesterday, and in principle, there should be no phenomenon of no rice for sale. It is heard that the Municipal Government's Commercial Bureau has taken various swift and effective measures to stop this.

### Two Rice Merchants Suspected of Aiding the Enemy in the Grain Loan Fraud Case

Zhang Chao and Xu Taiyuan to be Investigated by the High Court

[Report from this newspaper] Among the rice merchants who obtained loans in the grain loan fraud case are Zhang Chao of Hengtai Feng Rice Shop and Xu Taiyuan of Zhifeng Rice Shop, who, in the past during the period of enemy occupation, were suspected of purchasing military grain and assisting the enemy and puppets. Mayor Wu sent a letter to the Garrison Headquarters a few days ago to investigate them, but the Military Law Office believed that this was a case of suspected traitors and was not related to the grain loan case itself, so it decided yesterday to forward the mayor's letter to the High Court for handling.

District Prosecutor's Office to Welcome and Extract the Two Rice Merchants; Minister Xu Has Not Yet Responded

The Military Law Office's investigation of the grain loan case was completed the day before yesterday after extracting a statement from Ren Xingzhen.

### Shen Siliang, President of St. John's University During the Enemy and Puppet Period, Arrested and Interrogated, Carried a Package, and Was Imprisoned

[Report from this newspaper] Shen Siliang, the former president of St. John's University, has been arrested by the Garrison Headquarters on the orders of the National Government on the basis of his collaboration with the enemy. At 11:00 AM yesterday, he was transferred to the Shanghai High Court Prosecutor's Office in Tilanqiao. At around 4:00 PM, the court opened to investigate. After questioning the defendant's age, origin, address, and crimes, he was imprisoned in Shanghai Prison. At that time, Shen was wearing a Pealess suit, a white Hong Kong shirt, with his collar turned up, carrying a huge white and blue striped cloth package, with a dark complexion, a frowning face, and a very worried appearance. Under the guard of the bailiffs, he silently lowered his head and walked into the iron gate of Shanghai Prison.

### Reversion of Yida Dyeing Factory Runs into Problems; Employees Report on Chairman Wang Xifan; District Prosecutor's Office Begins Investigation

[Report from this newspaper] The Shanghai No. 6 Printing and Dyeing Factory of the China Textile Construction Company, formerly the Yida Dyeing Factory during the enemy and puppet period, was recently applied for reversion by Wang Xifan, the former chairman of Yida, to the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau, and was approved. The handover was scheduled for the day before yesterday, supervised by Cheng Shouzhong, a commissioner of the Handling Bureau, together with Dai Lizhen, Cheng Yanghe of the Textile Industry Management Committee, and Chen Xianfan, a special commissioner of China Textiles. When Wang Xifan was discussing the handover procedures, representatives of the factory's employees requested to attend the meeting as observers. After taking their seats, the employee representatives spoke one after another, arguing that since Wang was the chairman of Yida, and Yida cooperated with the Japanese Gonda Textile Factory during the enemy and puppet period, and the manager of Yida was also appointed by Gonda, first Rokusho Naotaka and then Inoue Mitsujiro, then Wang Xifan was suspected of colluding with the enemy and fraudulently applying for reversion. It seemed inappropriate to grant reversion immediately. They also indicated that the employees had filed a report with the court. After hearing this, Commissioner Chen and others believed that the facts were still awaiting investigation and immediately suspended the reversion. It is heard that the court's prosecutor's office sent personnel to the factory yesterday and summoned Wang Xifan to investigate the organization of Yida at that time.

### Yang Guangzheng on Trial

[Our Dispatch] Yang Guangzheng (originally named Jin Hao, also known as Shouqing, Qingtao), a native of Fengxian, Jiangsu, 37 years old, was an editor at Beixin Bookstore before the war. Later, he taught at Hongyi Middle School. After 1943, he served as the editor of the "Shen Bao" yearbook and also as a director of the puppet Sino-Japanese Cultural Association, engaging in the work of communicating enemy cultural ideas. After the victory, he was arrested. The High Procuratorate prosecuted him on suspicion of being a traitor. He was tried in court yesterday morning. Yang Guangzheng, wearing a gray long gown, entered the courtroom with a smile. According to his statement, the so-called "China-Japan Cultural Association" director position was brought to him by Zhou Huarin. He had no work and no remuneration. Although the chairman of the branch was the traitor Chen Gongbo, the actual person in charge was Zhou Huarin. At that time, Liu Haisu and others were also pulled in as members, so it can be seen that it was really unavoidable. Subsequently, the witness Chen Gaoyong testified that Yang Guangzheng's concept of the nation has not changed from beginning to end. In 1944, when Chen served as the director of the Shanghai Cultural Movement Committee of the Kuomintang, he summoned Yang as an intelligence officer, providing a lot of enemy and puppet cultural information. Further testimony by witnesses Xie An and Wang Ruoqi, that Yang was the editor of the "Shen Bao" yearbook, but the actual person in charge was Chen Bin. Later, lawyer Xu Zhisong provided evidence of five letters proving Yang's contact with underground workers, and presented the 1936 Kaiming "Literary Yearbook" and four issues of the Zhengyan Literary Monthly, and requested that the Education Ministry's Shanghai Commissioner Chen Baohua and the Chief of the First Propaganda Team of the Third War Zone and Commissioner Xue Yichong be summoned as witnesses. The court ordered the hearing to be rescheduled.

### Small Traitors Await Sentencing

[Our Dispatch] Xu Weizhen, the president of the puppet Shanghai High Court, was sentenced by the High Court yesterday morning. The main text read: "Xu Weizhen, in collusion with the enemy, conspired to rebel against his own country, sentenced to ten years of imprisonment, deprived of public rights for ten years, all property confiscated, except for necessary living expenses for family members." Xu reacted with displeasure upon hearing the sentence, repeatedly saying he would not accept it and would apply for a retrial. Zhao Yutang, the puppet Shanghai District Court Prosecutor, was also sentenced at the same time, to seven years of imprisonment, deprived of public rights for seven years, and property confiscated. Zhao remained silent after hearing the verdict, and when he was escorted back to prison, he showed no signs of worry, frequently nodding and greeting onlookers, appearing very philosophical.

On the same day, Xu Hengbo, an investigator of the puppet Bengbu Opium Prohibition Bureau and a section chief of the Nantong Opium Prohibition Bureau, and the cases of Lu Jinsheng and Gao Bolin were also sentenced. Xu was sentenced to one year and three months of imprisonment, deprived of public rights for two years, and all property confiscated except for necessary living expenses for family members. Lu Jinsheng and Gao Bolin were accused of serving as enemy secret agents, but were deemed to have insufficient evidence, and the jurisdiction was incorrect, so they were transferred to the Shanghai District Court for trial.

### American Agricultural Experts Arrive in Shanghai; Discuss Mission and Objectives; Improve Agricultural Specialties; Promote Export Trade

About to Depart for On-site Investigations in Various Locations

[Our Dispatch] The American delegation of the Executive Yuan Sino-American Agricultural Technical Cooperation Group, a group of eight people, including Dr. H. H. Hutcheson, the head of the delegation, Muir, the deputy head and secretary, and members Case, Buck, Huber, Burns, Sietch, and Grand, arrived at Jiangwan Airport in this city at around 6:00 AM yesterday. In addition, delegation members Nashby and Hemmer had already arrived in China in February of this year. At 6:30 PM yesterday afternoon, the American delegation and the Chinese delegation, including Shen Zonghan, hosted a reception for the city's press at the Tsinghua Alumni Association in the Citibank Building. At the reception, Dr. H. H. Hutcheson, the head of the American delegation, gave a speech. Mr. Hutcheson first elaborated on the purpose of this trip for the American representatives. In terms of purpose, it can be divided into three points:

(1) Advise the Chinese government on agricultural plans and the organization for implementing these plans, (2) Make recommendations on the parts of the plan suitable for cooperation between the two governments, and stipulate the policies, personnel, tools, and organization required to implement this plan, and (3) Advise on immediate action to be taken on urgent issues. Next, he described the procedure for carrying out the work. Mr. Hutcheson said that the work of the group will be planned in cooperation by representatives from both China and the United States. Therefore, the members of the two countries will work in close contact and conduct on-site investigations. Finally, they will jointly study how to proceed in order to achieve the objectives of the plan. He said that the members of the Sino-American delegation are mostly experts with both knowledge and experience, and he sincerely hopes that each will do their best to make a contribution. Therefore, all the conclusions and plans of the group are based on the cooperation of the delegation members of the two countries. It is said that the American delegation will stay in Shanghai for ten days and then go to Beijing. In both Beijing and Shanghai, they will have many talks and discussions with all relevant parties, so that the American delegation can better understand the situation in our country. After this preparation, they will be divided into small groups to conduct on-site investigations in various places to understand the true situation. The estimated investigation time is about two months. After the investigation is completed, they will gather all the figures and data, formulate practical improvement plans, and suggest steps for implementing the plans to contribute to the government for adoption. The group will pay special attention to the improvement of China's four major agricultural products for export trade, such as tung oil, tea, silk, and wool, in order to increase production, improve varieties, promote China's export trade, and enrich China's foreign exchange resources. In addition to studying and handling urgent issues, the most important task of the country will focus on permanent agricultural improvements and cooperation plans. Mr. Hutcheson then listed the citrus fruits of California, the peach varieties of the West, and the soybeans of Illinois, all of which originated in our country, so he believes that Chinese agriculture has made a great contribution to the United States. It is heard that the scope of the group's investigation will extend as far west as Gansu and Qinghai, as far south as Hainan Island and Taiwan, and as far north as the nine northeastern provinces. The American delegation members will stay in China for about four and a half months.

### Speculation Fails, Wild Ideas Emerge, Tong Chengde, Owner of Feida Securities Firm, Conspired with Courtesan to Issue Bad Checks, Defrauding 120 Million

[Our Dispatch] Tong Chengde, a native of Ningbo, opened the Feida Securities Firm at No. 527 Cishu Building, Nanjing Road. Recently, due to speculation failure, he conspired with courtesan Chen Lanqing and her brother Zongwang to issue four bad checks, defrauding Yimao Enterprise Company of 19,500 shares of Yong'an Yarn Factory stock, worth more than 120 million legal tender. Afterwards, the victim, Chu Deshou, reported the case to the Huangpu Police Bureau. The branch director, Du Zui, ordered the section chief of the Second Section, Zhou, section members Cao Yiwen, police chief Zhao Hairu, Chen Zhifan and others to investigate.

It was quickly learned that the issuer of the checks was Chen Lanqing's brother, Zongwang, with a face value of 30 million per check, totaling 120 million. It was also found at the Xinhua Bank that Chen Zongwang's account had only 4,000 yuan in savings. Therefore, they went to No. 24 Central Road and arrested Chen Zongwang and his sister Lanqing together. Chen confessed that it was his sister who instructed him. Chen Lanqing confessed that the four checks were all given to Tong Chengde, the owner of Feida Securities Firm. After purchasing Yong'an Yarn Factory stocks, they were sold again, earning more than 30,000 U.S. dollars and more than one million (face value) in government bonds. However, when asked where these gold bills and government bonds were, she falsely claimed that they were all lost on a rickshaw. When Tong Chengde was arrested, Tong was nowhere to be found. Later, Tong was arrested at the Gongli Hospital on Fuxing Road. When interrogated, Tong also denied the allegations and denied intentional fraud, claiming that the U.S. dollar notes and government bonds were lost by Chen Lanqing. Later, after discussion among the investigating police officers, Cao instructed police officer Ju Xingmei and others on the matter, and on the afternoon of the 24th, police officers disguised themselves as lawbreakers and locked them up in the same detention center as Tong, intending to uncover the truth. Sure enough, at around 2:00 AM on the morning of the 25th, the prisoner Tong asked the police officer on duty outside to pour tea, and then took the opportunity to call Chen Lanqing, who was imprisoned in the adjacent room, and said that the U.S. dollar notes and government bonds at home must not be acknowledged, otherwise he would be guilty, and so on. At that time, the disguised police officers recorded Tong's conversation and brought them out again for interrogation. Chen and Tong were speechless and finally confessed the truth, saying that they had resorted to this last resort due to speculation failure, and also confessed the location of the stolen goods. The original group of police officers then went to Tong's residence at No. 28 Jing'an Villa and seized 21,650 U.S. dollar notes and 1.23 million in government bonds. At this point, the whole case was revealed, and they were transferred to the local prosecutor's office for investigation yesterday morning.

### Speculation Fails, Messy Cleanup, Another Bad Check Case

[Our Dispatch] The Dagong Securities Firm at No. 535 Securities Building was established by manager Shi Yingzhou, associate manager Zhu Yucang, and accountant Xie Zhonghe. A few days ago, they used 30 shares of Xinnuo Yarn Factory stock, 100 shares of Jardine Matheson Yarn Factory stock, and two gold bars to borrow 10 million yuan from Fu Bingkui for use. However, in mid-June, Shi and others issued a check from Qingcheng Qianzhuang to redeem the items from the Fu family. However, on June 21, the securities firm suddenly closed down, causing the Qingcheng Zhuang check to bounce due to insufficient funds. Afterwards, Fu reported the case to the Lao Zha Police Bureau for prosecution. Shi, the director of the Shi branch, ordered the section chief Jiang to send officers to arrest and interrogate the defendants Shi Yingzhou and others. It was learned that they also suffered a huge loss of 30 million due to speculation failure, and a strict investigation is currently underway.

### Ordering Jeeps Impossible to Sell, American Merchants in Shanghai Cry Foul

[United Press dispatch from this city] Many American veterans and civilians in Shanghai have pooled their resources to do business in China. Seeing that Jeeps are cheap, freight is low, and sales are good, they have ordered Jeeps from the U.S. Foreign Liquidation Commission to be shipped to Shanghai for wholesale. The Liquidation Commission has already approved the orders and will deliver the goods to Shanghai within two weeks, but they did not inform them in advance that the Chinese government has stipulated that ordinary people are not allowed to purchase Jeeps. They said today that they have been "swindled by the Liquidation Commission."

### Shipping News

### Chen Yuansheng, the Main Culprit in the Gold Bar Case, Directly Admits His Crimes, Misled by Speculation, Mistake After Mistake

[Our Dispatch] Chen Yuansheng, the main culprit in the Central Bank embezzlement case, was previously apprehended in Shangyu County. After being escorted to the Huangpu Branch of the Shanghai Municipal Police Department, he was escorted by the bureau to the local court prosecutor's office on Xuehuali Road at 11:00 AM yesterday. The court opened the investigation at about 5:00 PM in the afternoon, and after a brief interrogation, he was taken to the detention center of the local court. Yesterday, Chen wore a dark gray silk short shirt and pants, black cloth shoes, and his attitude was calm and his speech was slow. He admitted to all the crimes he committed, but claimed that he was misled by speculation, mistake after mistake, and that the embezzlement of public funds was too large, so he had no choice but to resort to this last resort. Prosecutor Gu Hongbiao previously believed that Chen's speculative activities and wasteful spending, and the fact that he had stolen gold bars and bonds under his custody as part of his duties, and his status as a public official in a national bank, constituted a violation of Article 3, Paragraph 2 of the Regulations on Punishment of Corruption. After this investigation, if new evidence is discovered, a public prosecution will be filed separately.

### Under the Pretense of "Reporting Traitors," Impersonating Soldiers for Extortion

Director of Cigarette Factory Secretly Reports to Police Bureau, Fuchunlou Restaurant Catches Four Criminals in Disguise

[Our Dispatch] Zhu Yongnian, a Changchun native residing at No. 35 Heqing Lane, Xindagulu Road, is the sales director of the Yue Dong Cigarette Factory in this city. At 2:00 PM on the 17th of this month, a man in military uniform, accompanied by a plainclothes man, went to his residence, claiming to be from the Fenglai Road Gendarmerie Corps, accusing Zhu of being a traitor and attempting to extort money. However, Zhu was not at home at the time, and his second landlord, Fan Fengqi, came out to deal with the two men. Then, the man in military uniform instructed the second landlord not to move any of the furniture in Zhu's room, and then left. Later, when Zhu returned home and learned of the incident, he immediately recalled that an acquaintance, Su Xingan, had advised him that someone was planning to report him as a traitor, so he went to Su to inquire about the truth. Su Xingan then colluded with Cui Chuntang, Wang Jian, Zeng Xiangchu and others to repeatedly invite Zhu Yongnian to public places such as the Royal Cafe, Dasyuan Tea Room, and Mei Hua Restaurant for negotiations, falsely claiming that if he wanted to settle the case, he would have to pay 20 gold bars. Zhu could not afford this huge sum, and after repeated negotiations, it was finally reduced to eight gold bars, scheduled to be delivered at the Huake Road Fuchunlou Restaurant on the morning of the 24th of this month. Zhu then suspected that Su and others were impersonating soldiers to extort money and secretly reported it to the Taishan Branch. Director Luo Song Tingjun supervised the section chief Zhang Rou, section members Zhang Jiashi, Jin Zhongxiong, Ha Jiagang, and police officers Shao Guanrong, Huang Yangquan, Li Xinheng, and Jin Yuancai to dress up as customers and wait at Fuchunlou. When Su Xingan and others arrived, Zhu handed over a check for 12 million yuan and 500,000 yuan in cash to the other party. At this time, the officers immediately arrested Su Xingan, Zeng Xiangchu, Wang Jian, and Cui Chuntang and brought them back to the bureau for interrogation. As the case was related to impersonating soldiers for extortion, the interrogation is currently underway, and they will be transferred to the local prosecutor's office for handling.

Many family members of the victims, including Wu Yucang, appeared in court to state the circumstances of their arrest and victimization at the time, and said that most of the victims were in their prime and were falsely accused by Mi Cun of being communists and were brutally murdered. Today, they have elderly parents and wives and children, and their lives have become problematic. Their words were extremely sorrowful, and they demanded that Mi Cun be severely punished.

The defendant was detained by the Japanese army in a concentration camp for more than 90 days when Italy surrendered in 1943. Later, he reached an agreement with the Japanese army to release all the Italians in the camp, on the condition that the defendant would lead hundreds of sailors and Italian marines on the Italian ship Conte Verde to assist the Japanese army in military production at the Jiangnan Shipyard. The defendant then left Shanghai in January 1945 and went to Beidaihe.

### City Theaters to Suspend Operations Next Month

Insistent on Demanding Tax Reduction, City Government Considers it Unreasonable

[Report from our newspaper] The Theatrical Guild of this city, represented by Zhou Jianyun and four other delegates, presented three demands to the City Government the day before yesterday: (1) Extend business hours; (2) Abolish ticket price limits; (3) Reduce entertainment tax. These demands were resolved by the guild meeting. If no satisfactory response is received, all ninety-plus theaters in Shanghai will suspend operations starting July 1st. To this end, our reporter made a special visit to the Municipal Finance Bureau. According to Director Chen of the Third Division of the bureau: The Finance Bureau and the Social Affairs Bureau exchanged opinions yesterday morning. The result was that the city government may accept the first two items, but the tax reduction issue is likely to be difficult to achieve, as the entertainment tax is currently a major source of revenue for the city treasury. It was unanimously believed that there was some contradiction in their demands. Since they want to increase ticket prices, they can certainly increase revenue, so there is no need to reduce taxes. This matter has been submitted to Mayor Wu for a decision, and the handling measures will be put forward for discussion at today's municipal meeting.

[Another Report] According to the latest information obtained by our reporter: The Theatrical Guild of this city has decided to suspend operations uniformly starting July 1st. This is because when the guild held a general membership meeting yesterday afternoon, it learned that the authorities might accept the first two items, but the tax reduction was difficult to implement. Therefore, the guild made this firm statement and decided to hold another meeting tomorrow to discuss the livelihood issues of the members during the suspension period. The guild includes ten groups such as Peking Opera, spoken drama, Cantonese opera, and Shanghai opera, with a total of more than ninety theaters. Whether the spoken drama circle will participate in this suspension remains to be decided after today's meeting. The film industry is excluded.

### Market Idle Funds Fuel Buying Spree, Gold Price Breaks Two Million Mark, Hong Kong Dollar Still in High Demand

Yesterday, buyers continued to act on the psychology of valuing gold over cash. Speculators' surplus capital created demand exceeding supply. Starting from a strong 1.96 million in the morning, the price gradually increased. The central government's allocation of 306 bars further drove the price to 1.9775 million. After 10 AM, the situation strengthened, and by noon, it approached the 2 million mark. In the afternoon, the buying spree intensified, breaking through the 2 million mark and reaching a high price of 2.03 million. Afterward, it turned into a moderate fluctuation. As a result, the closing price was a sharp increase of 52,000 compared to the previous day. Gold jewelry was listed as high as 214,000, silver at 2,200, and the unofficial money market was stable, with interest rates at 1.3 to 1.6.

Foreign currency, especially US dollars, remained unpopular, far less so than gold. Although there were a few buyers from the gold sector, the increase was limited. The morning opened with buying at 2660 yuan and selling at 2680 yuan. This price held for a long time. At noon, it was passively raised to 2690 yuan. In the afternoon, it was still pulled up by the gold market to 2730 yuan before slightly stabilizing. As a result, the closing price was up 50 yuan compared to the previous day, with the spread widening to 745 yuan per ten taels. The Hong Kong dollar remained in high demand, rising another 10 yuan, with the Hong Kong exchange rate at 550 yuan, the Indian exchange rate at 670 yuan, and the British exchange rate at 8700 yuan for selling, with low trading volumes. The US exchange rate remained largely unchanged.

Following the successful major loan from the UK to the US, the UK's domestic and sterling bloc finances have become more stable. In the sterling bloc, the British authorities are currently maintaining a standard exchange rate of 4.02 (the value of each pound sterling in US dollars). Sino-British trade has not yet begun, so there are no formal regulations or strict controls on exchange rates. Recently, British merchants have been eager to restore and develop their Far East business. Additionally, requests for US dollars to purchase non-essential goods are not being approved. Trading houses dealing in non-essential goods are turning to buy pounds sterling and transferring them to US dollars, causing the value of the pound sterling to rise to nearly 8450 yuan due to competition among Chinese and foreign merchants. Other currencies, such as rupees and Hong Kong dollars, have also risen.

### Truth About Settling European Exchange Rates: Purchase of British Goods Should Be Settled in Pounds Sterling, No So-Called Black Market Exchange Rate

[By Our Reporter] Recently, import and export traders in this city have heard that designated foreign exchange banks have been ordered not to settle payments for goods imported from European countries in US dollars. The reporter inquired about this matter with relevant parties at the Central Bank. It was stated that it was never reasonable to order and import goods from the UK with US dollars, so it was stipulated long ago that purchases of goods from the UK should be settled in pounds sterling. The same is true for other European countries, so there has been no recent change. It was also stated that the Central Bank is currently only issuing telegraphic transfer rates for US dollars. For exchange rates of other countries, designated foreign exchange banks may offer rates based on their own circumstances. These rates fluctuate slightly based purely on supply and demand, and there is no so-called black market exchange rate.

### Limited Fluctuations in Public Bonds, Scant Over-the-Counter Trading, Various Prices Gradually Converging

Over-the-counter trading of public bonds was minimal. Some parties were forced to sell due to tight money conditions. A certain member of the Fifth Floor Northern Gang slightly replenished their holdings, but the increase was limited. The price difference for Type C bonds was only 70 yuan. The situation was stagnant. As a result, due to the inability of Type C bonds to rally, miscellaneous bonds also slightly declined.

### Chinese Stocks Turn From Weak to Strong, Major Players Concentrate Funds to Buy Foreign Stocks

Chinese stocks turned slightly stronger yesterday. The market situation was quite stable, and outside idle funds took advantage of the low prices to accumulate holdings. The number of floating shares was slightly reduced. Prices of various stocks gradually trended higher after opening, but less popular stocks showed a divergent trend. Popular stocks opened lower and closed higher, with narrow intraday fluctuations. As a result, popular stocks such as Yongsha slightly rebounded compared to the previous closing price. Among smaller and less popular stocks, Xinyi slightly rose, Zhongfang was flat, and the rest slightly declined. Old stocks made no progress.

Major players gathered funds to buy foreign stocks. Large stocks targeted British Union and Jardine Matheson, while smaller stocks favored Jardine Matheson products. Due to seasonal factors, the demand was extremely high, resulting in substantial profits. After opening, Yishasha rose from 9200 yuan and British Union from 8300 yuan, gradually improving. Other stocks were also brought up accordingly, closing at high prices. As a result, compared to the previous closing price, British Union alone rose by 15%, Yisha, Yibian, Steel and Paper each rose by 10%, and Jardine Matheson, due to its large price, only rose by 5%. Although Yeguang and Asia rose, the increase was not significant.

New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory held a shareholders' meeting yesterday, resolving to change the capital from 120 million yuan of puppet currency to legal tender, and to issue a dividend of one yuan and a gift allowance of two yuan.

### Sugar Prices Remain Firm

3,000 Packages of Shantou Qing Arrive, 4,000 Tons of Chinese Sugar Arrive Today

Yesterday, although there were shipments of Chinese white sugar thrown out on the market, they had not yet arrived in Shanghai. Distant water cannot quench immediate thirst, so the market trend remained firm. The association initially set the price for Chinese white sugar at 115,000 yuan to 3,000 yuan, then to 7,000 yuan and 9,000 yuan, reaching 120,000 yuan. Shipments were priced from 101,000 yuan to 3,450 yuan, then to 110,000 yuan. Warehouse receipts were at 111,000 yuan, 3,000 yuan, 3,500 yuan, and even saw a high price of 119,000 yuan. Forty packages of Shantou Qing were opened at 98,000 yuan, up 3,000 yuan. Over a hundred baskets of Zhongzhuang Xinghua white sugar were at 122,000 yuan, raw sugar was marked at 105,000 yuan, and three and a half cars of white sugar were marked at 185,000 yuan. It was also heard that the Yanxun ship had already imported from Shantou and Xiamen yesterday, with approximately 3,000 packages of Shantou Qing and Dia Qing arriving in Shanghai. As soon as customs clearance procedures are completed, they can be exchanged. It was also heard that the Marler ship will arrive in Shanghai today, with the Taiwan company bringing 4,000 tons of Chinese sugar.

### Abundant Bamboo Supply, Price Returns

[By Our Reporter] Recently, bamboo rafts have been arriving in large quantities at Zhoujiaqiao on the Suzhou River and Longhua South Huangpu, one after another. As bamboo is one of the building materials, its previously short supply and high price have now been reversed due to the continuous flow of goods. However, according to people in the industry, bamboo prices at the production areas have risen, because the busy farming season has arrived, and new bamboo is just growing and cannot be felled. Moreover, labor costs are unusually high. Future arrivals are unlikely to be strong.

### Municipal Chamber of Commerce Urges Convening of National Economic Conference

[By Our Reporter] The National Economic Conference, for which the Ministry of Economic Affairs has drafted a list of members and is preparing to convene, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Economic Affairs, urging them to convene the meeting as soon as possible in order to determine economic policies and alleviate the suffering of the people. The original telegram stated: "The association convened the Ninth Member Representative Conference on June 23. Member representatives Luo Qinghua, Xu Jiqu, Jin Runxiang, Wang Xiaolai, Ge Jichen and others jointly proposed that the conference urge the government to convene a National Economic Conference as soon as possible to establish economic policies, salvage the crisis in industry and commerce, and promptly determine plans for recovery. The methods included: We propose that the conference telegraph the government, based on the National Chamber of Commerce expanded conference proposal, to regularly convene representatives from provincial and municipal chambers of commerce, representatives from industrial associations, and economic and financial experts, with the participation of ministers of finance, economics, agriculture, forestry, and social affairs, to hold a National Economic Conference, to jointly discuss ways to salvage the current crisis and redetermine economic policies, etc. After the conference decision, it should be immediately submitted to the competent ministries and departments for adoption and implementation. It is reasonable to present this telegram to your ministry and department for review, and to humbly request your adoption of the above suggestions, and to convene and hold a meeting in Beijing immediately, so that accurate policies can be used to promote orderly progress, to alleviate the suffering of the people and alleviate their hardships, this is the most anticipated and prayerful desire."

### Slight Turnaround in Coal Situation

Coal market transactions are slightly more active, and the market situation shows a slight turnaround. Due to the inverted relationship between the cost of white coal and the market price, the arrival of Yangquan coal was affected. The stocks of those outside the industry are being sold off, so the market price has stopped falling and rebounded. The supply of bituminous coal from various sources still falls short of demand, so the Fuel Management Committee's allocation of coal for private production enterprises remains strict. Moreover, the inventory of high-grade goods on the market is thin, and the market situation is also firm.

### Fresh Orchid Bamboo Branches on Offer

The first batch of new orchid bamboo branches arrived yesterday on the Yanxun ship, along with a second batch of five to six hundred pieces of black leaf and early red branches. As the orchid bamboo is the first of its kind, its newness ensures a high price. However, as the number of early red black leaf branches is larger, the price is bound to fall.

### Yarn Market Still Short on Spot Goods, Cotton Cloth Market Stable

Yesterday, the yarn market remained stable. The Southern Gang still had an appetite for large yarns, so Shuangma was able to stand firm between 1.55 and 1.56 million. Demand for small and medium-sized yarns exceeded supply, and spot goods were scarce, so prices were also firm, continuing to rise by around 10,000. The price of 42-count double-strand thread was weak and slow-moving, deviating from the trend of 20-count yarn.

Due to the lack of spot goods, China Textile had not supplied it for several periods, and customers had some demand, so the market situation was firm, rising by 500 yuan. Although the base cloth was good, its sales were not widespread. There was not much change in the market for other cloths. The price of cloth opened by China Textile was average. In the afternoon, the price of serge went up another step.

### Re-establishment of Financial Institutions in Recovered Areas, Deadline Extended to July 15

[By Our Reporter] Banks and money shops that had not been registered with the ministry before June 26 of the Republic of China either continued to operate during the War of Resistance or were forced to stop. On February 5 of this year, the Ministry of Finance promulgated measures for the re-establishment of commercial banks in the recovered areas, and subsequently promulgated supplementary measures, unified and limited to three months, to submit documents for approval in order to continue operating or resume operations in their original locations. It is understood that the Ministry of Finance, due to inconvenient transportation and the late arrival of this order in various places, has stipulated that it will be uniformly extended to July 15, with no further extensions.

### Problems with Lun Chang Warehouse Receipts

The factory insists on proportional distribution; the Cotton Cloth Industry Association holds a meeting to discuss

[Our City News] Holders of cotton cloth warehouse receipts issued by the British Lun Chang factory before the outbreak of the Pacific War were unable to pick up their goods and were all seized by the enemy. After the victory, this seized cotton cloth, not taken away by the enemy, was discovered by the holders, who reported it to the Cotton Cloth Industry Association for negotiations to retrieve it. After receiving the report, the association submitted it to the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau for approval. Now that the goods have been issued to the Lun Chang factory for collection first, the Lun Chang factory, after collecting the goods, insisted that customers and the factory should proportionally distribute the goods. All receipt holders believed that the factory had not fulfilled its responsibilities under the warehouse receipts. The customers discovered all seized goods and it was unfair for the company to suddenly insist on a proportional distribution. In order to find a solution, the association decided to convene a meeting of all warehouse receipt holders at the association at 4 pm today to seek their opinions for negotiations.

### Spot Cotton Prices Surge

Due to Continuous Rise in US Cotton

Yesterday, the New York US cotton telegram soared again by fifty to fifty-three pounds. The near-term US dollar was 30.49, the far-term was 30.67, and the Meterlin spot price was 31.15. Spot cotton trading in this city was more active. Tongyi, Rende, Shenxin First Factory, and small inland spinning factories all made purchases. Due to the soaring US cotton, the market price rose by a huge 34,000 yuan compared to the previous day.

### Wenzhou Zhenmei: Buyers Still Have Appetite, Bud Tea Market Continues to Be Lively

Zhenmei green tea, new goods from Wenzhou, have been on the market since the sale opened a few days ago. There are many sellers in the market, but the buyers also intend to take them. Therefore, they are still in negotiations. If they can get close, there is hope for another transaction. As for domestic sales, Wuxi, Yixing, and other places have a particularly urgent demand for Taiwan bud tea and black tea. Those holding the goods are taking the opportunity to pull up the price, so the market is advancing. For other teas, the appetite of the stores on this street is still sufficient, so although the selling atmosphere is firm, those inquiring are all waiting and watching. Therefore, transactions are weak, and the trend is as stable as before.

### Enemy-Puppet Confiscated Warehouse Receipts Are All Invalidated

[By Our Reporter] It is understood that the warehouses operated by the banking industry in this city have invalidated all warehouse receipts for enemy-puppet materials that have been confiscated, in accordance with the measures for handling enemy-puppet property by the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau.

### Large Batches of Cotton and Flour Shipped from the US Yesterday

[By Our Reporter] Large batches of cotton and flour arrived in Shanghai. The Qiaofei Pi Aitomen company, managed by the Hua Lun foreign firm, arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The ship, which came from the US, carried more than 37,380 pieces of cotton, 26,100 bags of flour, and 4,435 pine logs. Currently, it is docked at Pudong Longmao warehouse, unloading cotton.

### More Than 20,000 Loads of Huizhou Timber Were Scattered by Mountain Torrents

Recently learned: In Tunxi and the surrounding areas, heavy rain poured down last week, and mountain torrents broke out in Huigang, causing wood rafts parked along the banks of the Xin'an River to be washed away, resulting in heavy losses. It is reported that the amount of timber washed away from Tun to Hangzhou reached more than 20,000 loads. According to experienced timber traders, after this major loss of Huizhou timber, and given that it is currently the busy farming season, it will be difficult for spot goods to arrive in Hangzhou within a few months. In addition, the river water will dry up after autumn, making transportation difficult.

### Australian Wheat Production

Expected to Increase by More Than One-Third

[United Press, Melbourne, 26th] The Australian Minister of Agriculture recently reported that this season's wheat planting in Australia will reach 14,500,000 acres, an increase of more than 2,500,000 acres over last year. It is estimated that if the weather conditions are good, this year's harvest will reach 200,000,000 bushels. The last year before the war, Australia's wheat production was 155,000,000 bushels.

### Economic Briefs

After the victory, steel rebar has been widely used. However, there have been few imports of foreign goods, resulting in a depletion of inventory. There have been no goods available for sale for more than ten days. It has recently been heard that a batch of steel rebar loaded on a foreign ship will arrive in Shanghai within days.

[Hankou Electric] The Guangdong-Han Railway has been under construction for several months and is nearing completion. It has been decided to open to traffic on July 1. At that time, ceremonies will be held simultaneously in the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Guangdong.

According to news from the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau, the Ministry of Finance has exempted this year's profit tax. However, the profit tax in the months before the new tax regulations were announced on April 16 must still be paid.

In addition to restoring the original institutions in the recovered areas and establishing additional branches, the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau attaches importance to remittances from overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia and has started to handle remittances from overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia.

### Grain Transactions Must Be Registered, Bureau of Social Affairs Manages Grain Markets

By order of the Bureau of Social Affairs, all grain merchants in the city's grain markets must register and report the quantity of goods arriving and transacted from yesterday onward and are not allowed to transfer goods out of the city without authorization.

Kanshi White Rice Shop in the rice market adopts a rationing system for retail rice sales. Transactions with other businesses have virtually stopped. Yesterday, registered sales of white Japonica were 90 stone, polished Indica were 1677 stone, and rice shops transported and sold 697 stone and 294 bags themselves, totaling 2964 stone and 294 bags. However, there were no registered sales of Ke Tao, early rice, foreign Indica, Du Indica, Wu Indica, white Yuan, or Yin Yuan.

There were no changes in the rice market yesterday. Flour was slightly firmer. Bran was stable. The uptake of Shantou wheat was sluggish, and prices softened. The supply of soybeans was strong, but the digestion was slow, and prices fell by 5600 yuan. Bean cake rebounded by 2300 yuan due to high inquiries in Shantou. Oil prices fell slightly by 1000 yuan due to the strong supply of goods from various sources and ordinary digestion. Peanut appetite was weak, also down 12,000 yuan. Beans were also down 1000 yuan. Broad beans were arriving in large quantities and were not being sold, and prices fell by 5600 to 1000 yuan. Red beans were scarce and rose by 1000 yuan.

### Coal Production: Jiawang 600 Tons, Jianchang Only 5 Tons

[Xuzhou Electric] After the Ministry of Economic Affairs sent personnel to take over and supplement the equipment of the Huadong (Jiawang) Coal Mine, the output was actively reorganized and increased from 300 tons per day to more than 1000 tons. However, most of the miners in the mine are farmers, and coal mining is only a secondary occupation. As it is now the busy farming season, most of the miners have abandoned work to farm, which has affected production. The output has been reduced to more than 300 tons. The mine has now increased wages and production bonuses and is implementing work competitions. The daily output has increased slightly recently to about 600 tons.

[Wuchang News] The Tutang area near Wuchang, Wuxie Maoqiushan Luoboutang and other places, have abundant reserves of bituminous coal. In recent years, the mining has relied on manual labor, resulting in low output. The larger scale one is Jianchang Company, whose daily output is only 5 tons. The company is actively engaged in innovation and plans to add machinery to prepare for large-scale production this fall.

### Incoming Correspondence: Another Estimate of Cotton Yields - Losses of 30,000 to 50,000 Yuan Per Acre

Regarding Ms. Shi's statement in your newspaper article on the calculation of cotton yields, the cost items are missing two expenditures: fertilizer and taxes. Here is an estimate of cotton field yields and costs in the Nantong and Dongtai areas of northern Jiangsu for your reference.

1.  Yield: In good years, each acre can yield 130-140 *jin* (market weight) of seed cotton, while in bad years only 50-60 *jin*. Assuming that 3 *jin* of seed cotton yields 1 *jin* of ginned cotton, then each acre yields 20-40 *jin* of ginned cotton. The price of Shanghai fine short-staple cotton is 95,000 yuan per *dan* (Si Ma weight, approximately 1.25 *jin* market weight per *jin* Si Ma weight). In reality, cotton fields can only earn 15,000 yuan per acre in a typical year, and 30,000 yuan in a good year.

2.  Cost Expenditure: Cotton seeds cost about 2,000 yuan for 30 *jin* (market weight) per acre (according to current prices). For labor costs, including plowing wheat fields, planting, fertilizing, weeding, picking cotton, and removing cotton stalks, each acre requires at least 15 man-days. Each man-day is calculated at 5 *sheng* of rice (labor costs in northern Jiangsu are still low, including meals, cigarettes, and alcohol, each man-day is only 5 *sheng* of rice), requiring 45,000 yuan. Fertilizer costs 8,000 to 12,000 yuan (more fertilizer is needed for continuous cotton planting, less for intercropping cotton and rice). Land rent is approximately 5,000 to 7,000 yuan for 20-30 *jin* of seed cotton per acre. Taxes (in the Communist-controlled areas of northern Jiangsu, landowners and tenants each bear half) are about 3,000 yuan per acre. According to the above estimates, the income per acre is only 15,000 to 30,000 yuan, while the cost is 65,000 to 70,000 yuan, resulting in a loss of 35,000 to 55,000 yuan per harvest. Therefore, the low cotton price is a very unreasonable phenomenon. The current market price for "Golden Double Horse" 20-count yarn is 1.43 million yuan per bale. Each bale of yarn weighs 440 pounds net and requires 350 *jin* (Si Ma weight) of ginned cotton to produce (including cleaning losses). Adding labor costs, factory profits, and daily expenses, each bale of yarn is estimated to cost a maximum of 500,000 yuan. Therefore, a reasonable price for ginned cotton would be approximately 260,000 yuan per *Si Ma dan*. Before the war, each bale of yarn (20-count "Double Horse") cost about 140 yuan, and Tongzhou coarse cotton was priced at 22 yuan per *Si Ma dan*, while fine short-staple cotton was priced at 29 yuan per *Si Ma dan*. Thus, yarn prices have increased 10,000-fold, while cotton prices have only increased 4,000-fold. The excessive profits of spinning mills are too high, and cotton prices should be increased. Currently, the price of Tongzhou coarse cotton in the Communist-controlled areas of northern Jiangsu has reached 110,000 yuan per *market dan*. In reality, no cotton from northern Jiangsu is being shipped to Shanghai. This phenomenon of materials flowing to Communist-controlled areas is a significant blow to the government's economy. Fortunately, our government is paying attention to this. In addition, farmers mostly compensate for the losses in cotton planting with surpluses from early rice and income from side businesses. In terms of labor costs, if their own family members can handle it, they will not hire short-term workers and will exchange labor with neighbors. Moreover, they endure extreme hardship, just to get through this unreasonable period.

### The Wind and Sand of the Western Section of the Longhai Railway

— By Our Reporter Xu Shou Lian

The main purpose of the Shanghai reporters' delegation's trip north was to observe the disaster situation in the areas of northern Jiangsu, Henan, and Shandong, the current state of transportation, and the various conditions in the Yellow River flooded areas. However, apart from these, the sights and sounds along the way also seemed to be quite interesting. Although the impressions are fragmented, perhaps they can allow readers in the Jiangnan area to learn a little about the scenery outside of Jiangnan.

### Lead-Colored Sky - A Thick Cloud of Sand

A person who is used to living in the south will naturally feel different in every aspect of life when they suddenly go to the north, especially when the places they are going to are the cities along the western section of the Longhai Railway, such as Xuzhou, Kaifeng, and Zhengzhou, which were destroyed by eight years of war and whose vitality has not yet recovered. The first thing that makes you feel different is the wind and sand of the Central Plains. The reporter experienced the taste of wind and sand three times in the eleven-day trip. One time was in Zhengzhou, where the sky was a thick cloud of sand, rolling across the lead-colored sky—then, suddenly, it was dark and you couldn't see anything. In the house, you had to turn on the lights even during the day. When I was walking, I almost completely covered my face with a hat. When I got home, I saw that the brim of my hat had already accumulated a small sand dune.

### Yellow River Carp - A Unique Flavor

When the reporters' delegation passed through Beijing, the office in Beijing specially hosted us at Liangyuan on Taiping Road. Liangyuan is a famous Henan restaurant, so we had already tasted Henan cuisine in Beijing. However, when I went to Henan myself, I realized that only a very small number of people in Henan can eat this kind of cuisine!

Henan has suffered from years of disasters and constant warfare since the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War. Few people can even afford *wowotou* (cornbread) to live on. It is unknown how many people cannot eat salt and sugar all year round. Millions of people are in urgent need of relief. The severity of the disaster is no less than that in the provinces of Hunan and Guangxi!

In most people's imagination, Yellow River carp should be the most common food in Henan, but that is not the case. In Kaifeng and Zhengzhou, Yellow River carp is an unparalleled delicacy to entertain distinguished guests, but a carp weighing more than two *jin* costs more than 10,000 yuan. There are many ways to cook Yellow River carp: sweet and sour, hot and sour, and even "one fish, three ways." The most delicious cooking method is called "Mrs. Fish," which is said to have been invented by the wife of the current Director of the Zhengzhou Pacification Headquarters, General Liu Jingfu (Zhi). It is to cook the Yellow River carp with bean sheets and a little chili. It has soup and is a bit like the spicy fish head in Shanghai.

### No Amount of Gold Bars Can Save the Housing Shortage

The destruction of the eight-year war is terrible. Otherwise, how could there be housing shortages everywhere! Throughout the trip, the reporters' delegation found that the housing shortage was the most serious problem everywhere. However, based on what I saw, the housing shortage in Kaifeng and Zhengzhou is a real housing shortage, because here, even with gold bars, there is still no way to solve it. Some government agencies are still working in the rubble. It is many times more serious than the artificial housing shortage in Shanghai!

### Pengcheng's Scenic Spots - Longing for Ancient Heroes

When visiting the western section of the Longhai Railway, we also took some time to visit many scenic spots and historical sites. In Xuzhou, the ancient city of Pengcheng, there is the Overlord Tower and the Overlord Palace left by Xiang Yu, all the way to Jiuli Mountain. In Kaifeng, there is the Yuwang Terrace, Xiangguo Temple, Iron Pagoda, and Dragon Pavilion, all of which are worth lingering over. In the Dragon Pavilion, the desolate image of Zhao Kuangyin can no longer be found. The residents have replaced him with the "Jade Emperor." But the magnificence of the Dragon Pavilion makes people long for the deeds of a generation of heroes. The villagers pointed out the distant former lakes of the Yang and Pan families of the Song Dynasty, as well as the place where Bao Longtu (Judge Bao) chopped Chen Shimei (a treacherous official) in the waist. Xiangguo Temple, one of the scenic spots, is as crowded as the City God Temple in Shanghai, with crowds of people, stalls, snacks, and street performers...almost the same as in Shanghai. But the architecture is really magnificent, stretching for about two *li* from the front gate to the scripture repository. Yuwang Terrace is the only scenic spot in Kaifeng, and it can be said to be the most beautiful scenic spot on the Longhai Line. Now, the Farmers' Association is running many orchards there. The architecture of Bishagang in Zhengzhou is also very magnificent. This is a memorial tower for national heroes, the memorial tower for Zhao Zhongyu, Tong Linge, and other heroes, which is currently under construction. It uses the four characters "Bixue Huangsha" (碧血黃沙 - blue blood and yellow sand) to commemorate the national martyrs of the north, which is indeed very appropriate.

### China's Youth - Entrusting with Endless Hope

In Kaifeng, we visited the experimental farm run by the Henan branch of the "Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration" (ERRRA) in Fanjiasi Village, Weishi County, in the Yellow River flooded area, ninety *li* away. On the way, we also paid tribute to Zhuxian Town, the famous site where Yue Wu Mu (Yue Fei) of the Southern Song Dynasty defeated the enemy. But what can be seen in Zhuxian Town now is only the towering earthen tower, which is left for future generations to pay tribute to. The Guanyu Temple now houses the First Provincial Nursery of Henan Province. This is an institution that specializes in sheltering child refugees. There are currently 467 male and female child refugees. The Henan branch of the "ERRRA" has provided a lot of supplies, so the nutrition and clothing of each child can still barely be maintained. This nursery is run very successfully, with strict discipline and special attention to physical exercise. Seeing these spirited children in Guanyu Temple in Zhuxian Town, it really makes people feel that China's youth has endless hope.

The newspaper industry in Xuzhou, Kaifeng, and Zhengzhou is quite developed, but it cannot be fully developed due to limited funds. There are five newspapers in Xuzhou, with the "Zhongbao" being larger in scale. There are nine in Kaifeng, including two evening newspapers. The "Minquan News" has the widest circulation, with one large sheet printed daily. There are five newspapers in Zhengzhou, the largest of which is the "Qunli News."

### A Tragedy - A Prostitute Commits Suicide by Drowning

Since Nanjing banned dancing, the dance girls have gathered in the Huaihe River to accompany guests on boat tours, and countless women are secretly engaging in flesh and blood careers, struggling on the line of life. Since the arrival of General Xue Yue, the director of the Pacification Headquarters in Xuzhou, the tea dances held by the International Friendship Association every Wednesday and Saturday have also been banned. However, the "special zones" in Xuzhou, Kaifeng, and Zhengzhou all exist openly, with each of the three places having nearly 300 prostitutes. Xuzhou is dominated by Jiangsu prostitutes, while Kaifeng and Zhengzhou are mostly local prostitutes. Most of them are refugees who have fled from the "liberated areas." When the reporter's delegation returned to Shanghai, the authorities in Xuzhou had already issued an order on June 20 to these poor people, ordering them to close down all businesses within five days. The day after the order was issued, a tragedy occurred when a prostitute who could not make a living quietly committed suicide by drowning in a well! (June 26)

### Surveying the Yellow River Flooded Area

— By Our Reporter Xu Shou Lian

In 1938, when the National Government moved inland, Wuhan became the most watched place in all of China and the world. The military and civilians at the front and rear were united, holding the greatest determination—to defend Wuhan!

The enemy had long been preparing to strike Wuhan directly from North China along the Pinghan Railway. At that time, the commander of the enemy's North China Expeditionary Force was Nishio, and the one in charge of seizing the Pinghan Railway was the troops of Doihara, whom all 400 million of our compatriots hated to the bone. This cunning and vicious spy created the September 18th Incident and organized Gu Rengeng's puppet regime. At this time, he formally took on the role of the vanguard in invading our country!

Our army had long been prepared. In the area of Henan, the most elite 20th Army Corps at that time was gathered, with General Wan Fulin as the commander-in-chief. In this army corps were also the troops of Guan Linzheng and Hu Zongnan. In addition, there were brave men transferred from Guizhou and other places. The morale was high, the military appearance was neat, and they were waiting for Doihara to invade.

However, Doihara did not come.

Because, on the day of the Dragon Boat Festival, the 20th Army Corps received an order to breach the Yellow River dike at Huayuankou in Zhengzhou!

The execution of the order was by the New Fourth Division of the 53rd Army. From that day on, the Yellow River changed course. The sacrifice of the people of Henan was tragic, but victory requires a price. This breach caused the enemy's strategy to completely change, thus delaying the fall of Wuhan by fourteen months.

These fourteen months were the turning point in the history of our country and even the world. Without these fourteen months, perhaps the victory of the United Nations would not have been so quick and so thorough. The sacrifice of the people of Henan was not without reward.

However, what a great sacrifice this was!

### A Great Sacrifice

We don't need to talk about the losses eight years ago, and even during the eight years. The following is part of the report from the Henan Provincial Government on the disaster situation of the Yellow River from the beginning of this year to June 10:

Luyi County Assembly: "The old course of the Yellow River has a peach flood, flowing in from the northwest of the county...about forty *li* long, the flooded area is about forty *li* long and wide...the wheat has been washed away, and it is difficult to sow in autumn, and the disaster has already formed this year..."

Lin Ying County Government: "...The river water has risen sharply, blocking the mouth and releasing water, gathering here, flooding more than 1,700 *mu* of fields, and those that were not flooded were also drowned, with no hope of harvest..."

Huaiyang County Assembly: "The Yellow River has risen sharply, causing floods and disasters, towns have been submerged, a vast ocean, the people who survived the disaster have suffered another flood, crying to the sky, and unable to survive..."

Xihua Seventh District Commissioner's Office: "...The Yellow River water has risen sharply for days, the flooded area is more than thirty *li* wide, the fields and crops have been destroyed, the cries of the displaced are everywhere, and 100,000 disaster victims are in urgent need of relief..."

Shenqiu County Government: "This county has suffered from the Yellow River flood for nine years...On the 7th of this month, the Yellow River water rose sharply, and its momentum was fierce, more severe than the autumn water of previous years, so that the planted wheat seedlings were all submerged, and the past houses were also washed away..."

Fugou County Assembly: "...The breach at Huayuankou has not been blocked, the flooded area is expanding day by day, and the disaster situation is increasing rather than decreasing...This year's summer flood will overflow, and the two townships of Sun and Yue in Hedong are particularly severely affected, a desolate scene, unbearable to see, and government orders cannot be implemented as a result...If the breach at Huayuankou is not blocked and closed early, the great flood will surely come again..."

There is no need to say more about the detailed losses. Let me quote a few sentences from the "Disaster Situation Record" issued by the Henan Provincial Government as a general narrative:

"...The eastern Henan Plain was originally known as a rich and prosperous area, but due to the Yellow River changing course and causing floods, more than 20 counties, including Zhongmou, Weishi, Fugou, and Xihua, have been deeply mired in the erosion of the Yellow River for eight years. Villages and towns have been submerged, and more than 1.7 million people have died or been injured! The remaining few high grounds protruding from the water are piled up with reed grass by the disaster victims to shelter them from the wind and rain, and the majority of the people have no home to return to, and they usually eat grass roots and tree bark to fill their stomachs. They are still continuing their wandering life..."

It also said: "In the past eight years, there have been 32 breaches, large and small, in official dikes and private embankments, totaling 91 places. The affected counties include Xihua, Yanling, Fugou, Huaiyang, Taikang, Suixian, Qixian, Weishi, Guangwu, Zhengxian, Zhecheng, Xiangcheng, Shangshui, Kaifeng, Luyi, Tongxu, Zhongmou, Weichuan, Shenqiu, and Chenliu, totaling 20 counties, with a death toll of more than 320,000 people (note: the actual number is 321,989 people)...The loss of houses is about 1.86 million, and the flooded land reaches more than 6.5 million *mu*!..."

This was a great war, a great victory. This victory did not come by chance. We did pay a very heavy price.

### Taiwan Still Uses Japanese Stamps

Dear Reporter, Taiwan has been taken over for eight months, and we will not talk about whether the measures of the Chief Executive's Office are reasonable, because this is a "major policy" and involves complex issues. Now there is a very simple matter that the Taiwan authorities have completely ignored, that is, the stamps in Taiwan. To this day, they are still using the old stamps of the "Great Japanese Empire Postal Service," which are only stamped with the seven characters "Taiwan Province, Republic of China" (sample attached). I wonder what the Taiwan Provincial Authorities intend to do? Use waste? Do they even see these small pieces of paper? They could have been used for the first few months, but why are they still being used today? Does Taiwan not have printing plants? Why not print them in Shanghai? Why not follow the example of the Northeast and transport domestic stamps there and stamp them with the words "Limited to Use in Taiwan Province"? This would save trouble and also take into account Taiwan's monetary system. This is not a small matter! It concerns the entire national system and can symbolize whether the country is unified. The Chinese Communists are printing separate "Border Area" stamps in order to secede. What do the Taiwan authorities mean by this?

### Garbage Piles Up Like Mountains

Dear Editor, On the sidewalk in front of Zhongxin Elementary School, south of the northern section of Wenchang Road, near the new garbage bridge in this city, garbage is piled up like mountains. It is said that this garbage was discarded by the warehouse of the nearby China Industrial Bank, and it has been there for many days. It is rained on and sunned, and the stench is steaming. All the passersby cover their noses. The elementary school students are only about ten years old, and their physique is weak, so they are most susceptible to infectious diseases. If this accumulation of garbage is not cleared up quickly, the impact on health is unimaginable! The street sweepers, who are responsible for cleaning the roads, turn a blind eye and do not ask about it. However, although the garbage does not move automatically, the epidemic has already spread without warning, so how can you not be afraid! The sanitation authorities probably have not noticed it because the area of the city is vast. I hope you can pay attention to it. Otherwise, if you work hard to prevent epidemics on the one hand, and allow them to be created on the other hand, I am afraid that the effect on public health will be twice the effort.

### The Coffin Storage Center Raises Prices Again and Again!

Dear Editor, When the war in Shanghai first broke out, my wife passed away in Shanghai, and I temporarily placed her coffin in the ordinary room of the Puan Coffin Storage Center on Daxilu Road, which cost 12 yuan per year. Since then, the price has been increased year by year, and starting this month, it has increased to more than 38,000 yuan per year. The facilities of the center are simple, covered only with reed mats, and have not been repaired for seven or eight years. Moreover, there are often four or five coffins stacked on top of each other. If I want to move the coffin back to my hometown for burial, they also demand more than 100,000 yuan for coffin removal fees, sanitation donations, and handling fees. With such continuous increases, how can ordinary people afford it? I would like to ask the municipal authorities, housing in this city is only calculated at 140 times the pre-war rate, so why should the coffin storage fee be increased by three or four thousand times? I urge the wise authorities to quickly stop this in order to relieve the people's suffering.

### Blocking the Breach and Work Relief

Victory has finally come. The United Nations has not forgotten the heroic sacrifices of thousands of Chinese compatriots. The American Yellow River expert Oliver J. Todd has taken on the mission of blocking the breach at Huayuankou. He said, "No matter how serious this 'Chinese disaster' is, I will complete the work of blocking the breach before July 1!"

The American engineers were skeptical of this bold statement, but Todd resolutely went to China. On March 1, the project to block the Yellow River breach and restore the dikes began.

The "breach" at Huayuankou was already 1,460 meters wide when the project started. In the past few months, the 800-meter-long western section of the earthen dike has been completed. At the time the reporter wrote this manuscript, I heard that the remaining 660 meters have also been completed, and it is time to "close the gap."

The "UNRRA" has indeed helped us a lot. The vehicles sent to the project area include jeeps, amphibious vehicles, excavators, cranes, and various earthmoving and pile-driving machines. In addition, there are many wood, piles, and cement, but the most substantial is the work relief method. In the Huayuankou area, there are now more than 10,000 refugees working hard. In their spare time after work, there are still some recreational activities. Some people sing *dagu* (a type of Chinese ballad) or perform *xiangsheng* (comic dialogue), allowing these tired fighters to get some relaxation.

Recently, 19 tractors transported by "UNRRA" to China have begun to replace manual labor in the Yellow River flooded area—Fanjia Village, Weishi County, Henan Province—to revive our post-war rural areas. This kind of tractor is still a pioneering endeavor in China's backward rural areas, so we must first train drivers and study its mechanical structure, management, and maintenance. The first batch of 28 trainees are all graduates of agricultural universities. Since the beginning of May, 2,500 *mu* of land has been reclaimed by them on this boundless wilderness.

Each of these tractors has 12 horsepower, but it cannot exert its power against larger grass roots and willow roots, as well as broken walls and ruins buried in the sand. Therefore, human labor has to be used. Therefore, the Henan branch of the "ERRRA" has employed more than 1,000 refugees here, who are engaged in cleaning work such as removing grass and pulling roots every day. The cost of eight hours of labor per day is 2.5 *jin* of flour and 150 yuan in legal currency. At noon, there is also a large bowl of thin porridge cooked with beans, millet, green vegetables, and salt, which is considered the richest meal in the disaster area. In addition, there are 78 tents for them to live in, and each tent can accommodate 18 people. Recently, the branch is also planning to set up a cooperative.

However, such work only accounts for one-four-hundredth of the vast Yellow River flooded area today. The most important part of the dike construction is in the Communist-controlled area. They do not trust anyone and believe that the dike construction has ulterior motives. Therefore, they initially opposed it desperately, then destroyed the machines. Now, Todd has rushed to the Communist-controlled area to discuss the work with them.

The autumn flood is coming soon, and we cannot afford the Communist Party's "delay after delay"!

Todd said: If everything goes smoothly, then two-thirds to three-quarters of the Yellow River's water volume can flow into the old course. After all the downstream dikes are repaired and strengthened in the fall, all the water flow can be returned to the old course. Then, we can talk about irrigation and drainage.

May the Chinese Communists remember General Marshall's words: "Victory does not come easily, we must not waste this victory!" (June 26, Shanghai)

### Social Services - Responding to Readers

Legal Questions

(1) Huang Yaoyu from Pinghu asks: There are two direct paternal brothers, the elder brother has no son, so the younger brother's son is adopted as his heir. When the adoptive grandmother was still alive, the fields were divided, and each held a deed as proof. Now the adoptive grandmother has passed away, and the adopted son has reached adulthood, but the adoptive mother does not abide by the division deed, but manages the property herself and monopolizes the benefits. The legal questions are as follows: (1) Now that the adopted son is an adult, can he manage the land according to the division deed? (2) Is it valid for the adopted son to entrust his biological father to collect the rent? (3) The property for the adoptive grandmother's meals, was promised to be managed by the two grandsons during her lifetime (there are witnesses). Is it legal to manage it? (4) If the adoptive mother does not abide by the law and the contract, and conceals the property, what procedures should be followed? (5) In order to swallow the fields, she accused the adopted son's biological father of being a guerrilla and sued him to the enemy and puppets, causing him to be detained for a long time. Which current laws can be cited?

[Lawyer Zhu Yakui answers] The system of inheriting the ancestral line has been abolished under current law. If the adopted son was adopted after May 5, 1931, his legal status can only be considered as an adopted son. (1) An adult son can naturally manage the property. (2) Valid. (3) Evidence of permission is required. (4) Mediation for handover can be requested. If it is still ineffective, a lawsuit should be filed in court for a judgment. (5) If losses have been suffered, compensation can be claimed.

(2) Yang Yiren asks: In 1928, I accepted the mortgage of several acres of fields. The deed stated that the term was six years. After the term expired, the original middleman repeatedly urged the mortgager to redeem the land, but because the mortgage price was higher than the selling price within the statutory period, the mortgager had no intention of redeeming and voluntarily gave up. I then registered with the Land Bureau and obtained ownership of the mortgaged property. Unexpectedly, in March 1941, the mortgager used the power of the enemy and puppets to forcibly redeem the land. At that time, I was forced to hand over all the printed receipts. I still have the deed and related documents that have not been handed over. I would like to ask the following questions: (1) Can the forced redemption relying on enemy power, which does not comply with the law, be denied? (2) Can the deed and related documents be used as evidence to deny the redemption of the field? (3) What procedures should be followed to regain ownership of the mortgaged property?

[Lawyer Zhu Yakui answers] If there is solid evidence of being forced, it can be denied. (2) It can be used as reference evidence, but not as evidence of being forced. (3) First conduct mediation. If it is ineffective, legal remedies can be sought.

### Rescuing Rural Sideline Occupations - Seeking Medicines for Pig and Chicken Plague

Sincerely Request Agricultural Chemists to Provide Solutions

To the Editor of Shen Bao Social Services: The majority of tenant farmers in our country are constantly struggling in hunger and cold after paying rent. What they usually rely on to maintain their livelihood is mainly raising pigs and chickens for eggs, which are the main sideline products, used as a means of relief and nutritional needs. However, the countryside follows old customs and does not know how to research and improve. In Yongkang, Zhejiang, there is always one or three or four outbreaks of pig wasting disease and chicken plague every year. The spread is very rapid, and it is completely wiped out in a few days. The heavy losses often affect the lives of the whole family. Some people say that the use of Wan Jin You (Tiger Balm) and Da Wang Oil can treat pig and chicken plague, but few are effective. I believe there must be effective medicines with experience at home and abroad. Please publish them in the Social Services column and widely seek them, with a focus on simplicity and suitability for the rural economy. This is also a great act of benevolence and virtue to help the urgent needs of the countryside. Xu Jiaopin from Mou Dian, Yongkang.

### The Tractor is Started

— Correspondence from Kaifeng, 21st Fan Hong

Using tractors to plow and harrow farmland is not only surprising in Henan, but also in China, and is an important reform in agriculture.

We took a car from the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration in the morning, left the South Gate, and went south, driving entirely on sandy roads. We couldn't see villages or trees, only the remaining half-broken walls, which were the relics of old villages. Zhuxian Town has also become a desolate place with a half-broken gate and no smoke. Further ahead to Mengzhuang, the same weeds occupied everything, and no trace of relics could be seen. The residents had long disappeared somewhere.

Plowing Once, Harrowing Once

There was a grassland deeper than people, and the car drove through the grass. People teased with weeds and looked at the endless plains. It was the homeland of the people in Central Plains who had been barren for seven or eight years. We couldn't help but shed a few tears of sympathy for those who had fled and died!

Further ahead to Fanzhuang, the site of tractor use. There were more than twenty people being trained by American technicians, all wearing country farmers' clothes, working hard to practice and learn. A large row of tents was where they rested. In addition, many returning Pan District people were digging tree roots and cutting grass. In addition to food, they also received more than one hundred yuan for pocket money every day. They were workers hired by the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's work-for-relief program. After clearing weeds and tree roots in a certain area, the tractor began to climb on the flat ground. The first time was plowing, and the second time was harrowing. Approximately, each machine can plow 60 mu of land per day, and 40 square feet per minute. It uses 15 gallons of gasoline per day, plows one foot deep and two feet wide. Each tractor carries two plow surfaces, so the plowed area is smaller. The Northwest Agricultural and Forestry College once had one of these tractors, but it was not used much and did not receive much attention.

After the tractor plowed, the new soil from the ground was turned up, and the weeds on the ground were turned down. This is an extremely fertile sandy loam. If wheat is planted in the fall, there will definitely be a very satisfactory harvest next year. It has been barren for seven or eight years. Seven or eight years of land rest, plus the fertile silt carried by the Yellow River, have created important factors for large-scale production in the future. We wish that this land, which has suffered the greatest harm, can become the most fertile soil, bringing the richest agricultural products to people every year.

Allocate a Little More Energy

This is now a farm run by the Yellow River Pan District Rehabilitation and Construction Guidance Committee and the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. There are also many staff members. There are already nineteen tractors, and the total allocation is fifty. The cultivated land has more than five hundred mu. Compared with the more than two million mu of wasteland, how far is the distance! I remember when I was in Chongqing, I heard that the tractors the United States gave us were to solve the difficulties of the loss of cattle in Henan (a loss of three-quarters, reaching more than 4 million). They were all supplied to Henan. At that time, it was said that Chinese people would not use them, and many people were struggling. Now, the allocated number is far from the total number, and only the Yellow River Pan District is being paid attention to, and it is still not enough. According to the working range and area of the tractor, the large plains of eastern and southern Henan are ideal working areas. The mountain basins in western Henan also have great uses. Speaking from the perspective of Henan Province, I hope to allocate a little more to the province to relieve and rehabilitate the rural areas that have suffered from droughts, plagues, and locusts for a long time.

Restore Rural Production

Seeing the use of tractors, we know that the scientification and mechanization of Chinese agriculture is not too difficult. Using these small farm tools does not necessarily require re-planning the area of domestic cultivated land and expanding the area of cultivated land. But we should pay attention to how to imitate and how to repair them. If these problems are solved, Chinese agriculture will definitely have a major revolution.

The Yellow River destroyed the fields and homes of the Pan District people, washed away the lives of wives, mothers, and daughters, and destroyed all their hopes... Now their fate has been brought back by the new type of tractor, their hope has been brought back, and our rural prosperity has also been brought back!

In the fading twilight, we returned excitedly in a jeep.

### A Visit to the Great Airfield

— Shao Fu

Two days ago, I had the opportunity to visit the Eighth Air Group of the great airfield. I got up early and spent a day wandering around the group headquarters and the airfield. Although I was tired, I gained a lot, especially the enthusiasm of the several Air Force friends in the Eighth Air Group.

For the past eight years, I have had a special and high regard for Air Force friends. It is not entirely because of their dangerous work and heroic combat, shouldering the difficult tasks under aerial disadvantage, but also because of the simple hearts of each of them, their burning enthusiasm, and their frank and sincere attitude. They are like brothers to each other, and they are so kind and straightforward to others. They are like children, pure. They seem to be fairies, and the ugliness of the world is irrelevant to them.

This kind of life situation cannot help but make me feel a high degree of affection for them.

During this visit, I ate a lunch of their "Air Force provisions," visited their dormitory, management office, runway, and B24 aircraft. I have many thoughts upon returning, but I will only mention two points here:

The first point is that their lives are not as enjoyable and comfortable as we imagine. More than a thousand people are squeezed into those small bungalows, eight or ten people in a room, and even double-deck bunks. So the soldiers have to live in temporary tents.

The second point is that in that desolate countryside, they lack mental stimulation besides work and often feel very depressed. Going to the city is far away, time-consuming, and costly. Therefore, they are very welcome to have friends come and talk to them.

The Eighth Air Group of the Air Force is composed of the most outstanding personnel who have been selected. They are working hard to open up China's maritime routes. I hope everyone can comfort them.

### Tanks Enter Hujiang

— Bao Zhongqi

A Thrilling Battlefield Performance

Since Major Chiang Wei-kuo attended the morning assembly at Hujiang University on June 3, the students of Hujiang University have completely integrated with his men, and the relationship is very harmonious. The student fellowships of Hujiang often invite their officers to give lectures on the situation on the India-Burma battlefield, or invite them to participate in ball games. On June 21, Major Chiang personally led the soldiers of the First Tank Battalion of the Chinese Armored Corps to Hujiang University to perform tank maneuvers.

After hearing the news, the students were all overjoyed and excited. Students with cameras also prepared their films in advance to avoid losing this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. The school suddenly became chaotic, as if facing a formidable enemy.

Many students were already standing at the gate waiting after lunch. Finally, amidst the enthusiastic expectations of nearly a thousand students, six M3A3 large tanks drove into the main gate of Hujiang University. Subsequently, Major Chiang Wei-kuo and his wife also arrived by car. The tank maneuver performance began amidst the enthusiastic applause.

Major Chiang jumped onto the temporary command platform and said a few words into the microphone. Then he introduced Captain Cai, Zhou, and Tang, who were in charge of the performance. They were all officers who had been highly regarded during the India-Burma campaign and were very happy to participate in the performance today.

Under Captain Cai's orders, Platoon Leader Tang commanded four tanks to start moving forward. He sat in the command tank with a green flag and relayed orders via radio. Each tank had four warriors: the radio operator, driver, gunner, and shooter. At this time, the students with cameras began their activity, capturing all kinds of angles, high, low, left, and right, leaving a precious page in the history of Hujiang.

At this time, five tanks were performing "performance demonstrations." Platoon Leader Tang's car took the lead, climbing a very high mud pile, with an inclination of nearly forty degrees, as if it were about to overturn. All of us, without battlefield experience, were frightened by the dangerous situation and screamed. Especially the female students at the windows of the girls' dormitory, looking down from a height, felt even more frightened. But the driver skillfully grasped the control stick (equivalent to the steering wheel on a car) and steadily crossed the mud pile. According to Major General Chiang, because of the limitations of the venue, the performance was not sufficient. On the India-Burma battlefield, driving over a small wooden bridge with only one side of the track was really dangerous! But every student was very satisfied with today's tank performance demonstration.

Next was "formation exercise." Three or four tanks were formed into a team, or lined up in a horizontal line, which is suitable for attacking and covering the advance of large troops; or lined up in a column, used for marching and frontal breakthroughs against the enemy; or lined up in a trapezoid, which is used to cover one's own flanks and surround the enemy's flanks; later, the wedge formation used for searching and advancing was demonstrated; finally, the anti-wedge team, which is beneficial for attacking the enemy's position, was closely arranged and connected, which was very spectacular. The performance exhausted all possible changes, making people feel as if they were lost in a fog.

After the "formation exercise" was completed, "battlefield rescue" was demonstrated. Assuming a tank is trapped in a difficult situation, unable to extricate itself and losing combat effectiveness, the tank will issue a distress whistle signal. At the same time, the personnel in the car also carried out machine guns, submachine guns and other weapons to get off the car and lie down to cover, so as to avoid being destroyed by the enemy. Until other rescue tanks arrive, use a cable to tow it to a safe location, and then inspect and repair it to restore its combat effectiveness.

Finally, after demonstrating the use of other tank formations, the application of periscopes, and the technique of aiming at the enemy and shooting, this great performance came to an end.

At this time, Chiang Wei-kuo spoke on the stage again: "Students, today's performance is over. Unfortunately, because of the limitations of the venue and the time, we could not use more tanks to perform more great programs. If we performed as much as possible, then your school's campus, which has not been repaired for a long time after the restoration of the school, will suffer greater losses." Indeed, the power of the tank is too amazing. Two very thick trees have been crushed by it. Deep car marks are also engraved on the grass, forming a criss-crossing pattern. There are also ruined walls and broken walls that were destroyed by the enemy during the war, which have been swept away by the tanks today.

After the exercise, Major Chiang Wei-kuo gave instructions to the twenty-odd officers and soldiers who participated in the performance, encouraging them greatly, and shook hands with each commander one by one. The officers and soldiers stood at attention and saluted, and then stepped onto the tanks that had galloped on the India-Burma battlefield to return to the camp. Major Chiang Wei-kuo also entered the car with his wife under the concentrated photography of more than a dozen cameras.

### Selling Old Books

— Fang Jun

Because of my love for reading, I have accumulated a lot of thread-bound books over the past twenty years. Among them, some were bought with a lot of money, and some were rare editions. I have always enjoyed touching them and flipping through them when I felt like it, often from day to night. Naturally, I have lost many during the more than twenty years of wandering, but because they are my beloved possessions, I prepared for each escape in advance. Fortunately, I have lost very few. Among these six hundred books, I have really had a relationship with them for more than twenty years, and I am very grateful to them for giving me a lot of knowledge over the years.

I have put a lot of effort into preserving them for many years, fearing that they would get moldy, so I carefully exposed them to the sun; fearing that they would be eaten by worms, I sprinkled stinky powder and hid peppercorns. No matter how poor or sick I was, I had to tidy them up, wipe the dust, and sort out the damaged pages every day. If I didn't work hard for several hours, I wouldn't stop. However, now I can no longer preserve them because of poverty and illness. The illness cannot be delayed for treatment, and at the same time, there are many mouths to feed in my family. Therefore, after pawning everything, I have to abandon them.

At first, my thoughts only turned to English books. I thought that after the victory, traffic would be unimpeded, and culture would restore the previous communication. As long as I had money, I wouldn't worry about not being able to buy English books. So I sold them to the old bookstore in whole numbers to get a visible price back. But I kept one book, "The Opium Clippers." That book was a gift from an American friend, and it was not sold on the market. It is said that there are no three copies in Hong Kong. It wasn't for these reasons that I wanted to save it, but to commemorate a friend's gift.

Now, even those rare editions are difficult to maintain my relationship with. I am forced to give them up again. Giving them up can allow me to exchange for a lot of medicine to treat my illness and the material to feed a group of parasites. People are always planning in this regard, right? I have become so burdened that I don't even want to continue being a human being.

From this batch of books, I recovered two relatively complete books from the Ming edition books. One is "Spring and Autumn Dew Commentary", and the other is "Xie Xuan Cheng Collection". There is only one volume of "Xie Xuan Cheng Collection". After the reinstallation by the book collector, the words "Gaozhai Reading Book" are written in red characters on the cover, and the small characters "Xie Xuan Cheng Collection Ming Zhang's 130 original engraved copy reinstalled on the 19th of October, Bingzi" are written in ink. "Chun Qiu Fan Lu Ping" is two books into one. There is a Pingyuan's knowledge after the preface, "Ming edition Dongzi, collected by Chen Xiaolian Tingying; after Xiaolian died, the book was scattered, and this copy was purchased by Pingyuan. Mr. Ye Chubai, and Yuan were colleagues in Jiaozhong School for five years, working hard without boasting, simple and quiet, for many years. Is it what Dongzi said, "Correct his righteousness without seeking his benefit, and understand his Tao without considering his merit"? Now I will leave this booklet to be sent when I go north, and I will record my admiration." "Pingyuan presented it with respect and recorded it in January of the third year of Xuantong".

I still have a relationship to keep these two books, not just because they are relatively complete, but because books are no longer worth money. Even if I sell them together, it won't increase the price much, so it's better to keep some.

Some people say that a son selling his ancestors' collection of books is a parasite. Then, my selling my own collection of books can be considered my own parasite!

### Seal Words and Seal Character

— Gao Tianxin

A country has national character, and a person has personal character. A seal also has seal character. Zhao Menglei of the Song Dynasty had excellent calligraphy, but his character in calligraphy was reduced because he served the Yuan Dynasty. Patriotic people would rather not hang it in their hall, or even burn it. Another Mr. (forget his surname) who is good at writing withered vine characters is a patriotic man with a national concept. When the enemy came to ask for police, knowing that it could not be refused, he raised a kitchen knife and cut off his arm to refuse. Because in a dispute between two countries, each should unconditionally do their best for their country, and that is what I mean by seal character. Moreover, art is a representative of national culture, and the identity of our artists can be imagined. We should respect and value ourselves. The government does pay attention to art and wants to catch up with other countries. Before the war, I saw the government allocate huge sums of money in Beijing to build the National Art Exhibition Hall, which still stands tall on Nanjing Guofu Road, which can be a proof. It may not be able to make direct material awards, and there are real difficulties. Artists should forgive it. During the nine years of the Anti-Japanese War, Shanghai was the largest city in our country. Have none of the seal engravers in Shanghai ever spoke for the enemy and puppets? This is also shameful.

### Business Sutra

One of the American millionaires, Thomas Lipton, was always taking care of the store affairs in his father's grocery store when he was young. His calculations were never wrong, making up for the lack of his father's ability to handle affairs. One day, when the old man sold half a dozen eggs to a customer, he looked very unhappy. After the customer left, he said:

"Father, you should let mother sell these eggs."

"Why?" his father said in surprise.

"Mother's hands are smaller than yours, so the eggs can look bigger." Lipton replied. (Translated from Capper's Weekly)

### The Holy Spring of the North, The Wise Spring of the South: Chongqing's Hot Springs

— Deng Qi

Around Chongqing, there are four hot springs in the east, south, west, and north. Of these, the east and west hot springs are quite far from Chongqing and not within the jurisdiction of the Chongqing city area, so they are not very well-known. However, the south and north springs are within Chongqing's boundaries, facing each other, with beautiful scenery. Visitors to Chongqing rarely miss a trip to these places.

The North Hot Spring is located more than seventy kilometers north of Chongqing city in Beibei. From Chongqing to Beibei, you can take a bus or a boat up the Jialing River.

Beibei is a new type of small metropolis. Some people even call it "Little Chongqing." It has all the essence of Chongqing, as well as extremely complete recreational facilities. However, it does not have Chongqing's ubiquitous dust and bustling city noise.

Taking a boat up the Jialing River, you arrive at Beibei. From Beibei, walking slowly along the Jialing River for four or five kilometers, you reach the North Hot Spring. The North Hot Spring occupies the mountainside of Wentang Gorge, with high gorges facing each other on both sides. Climbing ten steps, you can overlook Beibei, Xiaba, and Chongqing faintly in the distance. Looking down, you see the leisurely sails swaying on the Jialing River. Behind the North Spring is the towering Jinyun Mountain, with ancient trees concealing the beautiful peaks, giving it a truly extraordinary aura.

The North Spring has a park, a bathhouse, a swimming pool, a lotus pond, the Rushan Cave, and the Yangshan Pavilion. Bamboo forests, flowers, and spring water circulate and flow through the rocks everywhere. It is said that because of the geothermal heat in the north, the flowers and trees have a unique advantage, blooming early and fading late. The hot spring bathhouse "Huanchen," built on the left side of the Wentang Gorge mountainside, is fully equipped. In addition to a dozen or so bathhouses, there are indoor and outdoor swimming pools. After bathing, you can rest in the riverside tea shop, then walk along the winding stone path to Jinyun Mountain, the farm, and the Gang Library in the Glass Palace. The library has a large collection of books and antiques, among which the "Han Washbasin" is the most precious (note). It is truly a rare treasure, but it is only open for exhibition on holidays.

From the Chongqing city area, across the Yangtze River, to Haitangxi Station, take a bus for about 25 kilometers, passing Xiaowenquan and the Central Political School, you can reach the South Hot Spring. Peach and willow trees line the banks, encircling the foothills. Tourists flock here year-round. In the hot summer months, people come here to escape the heat. With a gentle breeze, the fragrance of flowers, and the songs of birds, how can there still be any suffering from the scorching heat?

The vicinity of the South Hot Spring is a village market in a rural area. A neat road, with white poplar trees on both sides, dense branches and leaves, shading the buildings, cleverly resembling entering a tranquil and pleasant courtyard.

Inside the South Hot Spring, there is the Xiaowenquan (in the Political School), a well-equipped hotel, restaurants, a library, a garden, and bathing places with bathhouses and swimming pools. The spring water is warm and clean. Embracing it in the water, or sitting at the spring vent, letting the agreeable spring water rush and flow, one's heart feels warm and comfortable, and all the accumulated fatigue of body and mind is washed away.

"The South Spring is Wise, the North Spring is Holy." I love Chongqing's North and South Hot Springs. I love the beauty of the North Spring, but I also like the charm of the South Spring…

Note: The Han Washbasin is a relic from the Tang Dynasty, shaped like a water basin made of alloy. The bottom of the basin is engraved with four relief carp, and each side of the rim has an ear. After adding water to the basin, rub the ears with your hands. Gently rubbing produces a clear sound, and as you gradually add water, the humming sound becomes as loud as a steam whistle, with a soft, melodious, and solemn tone. At this time, the water in the basin is seen to be sprayed from the four carp at the bottom of the basin, continuously, with the water flowers jumping, like a spring. The water flowers can reach a foot high, and when illuminated against the light, the water appears rainbow-colored, truly a spectacle.

### Arresting the Wrong Person

American military police in Korea ordered the people of Incheon not to ride on the outside of buses. One day, they patrolled in Jeeps and dragged down several civilians who were riding in a uncivilized manner. The passengers protested in vain. Finally, except for one person, the rest began to walk. Suddenly, that boor followed the slowly moving car and jumped onto it. The military police hurriedly caught up and dragged him to the side of the road again. But in the blink of an eye, he climbed onto the car again. At this time, the Americans walking along the road criticized them one after another, irritating the military police, who drove the man into the Jeep and took him to headquarters. They asked a translator to investigate why he was so daring. But upon asking, it turned out that he was the ticket seller!

### A Spectacle of Currency

— Dongfang Jing

All Kinds of Coins and Checks

The collection of various currencies in the collection department of Citibank in New York is truly a spectacle. At the same time, the horror of inflation can also be seen from here.

There, is a German coin from after the First World War, worth 1,000,000,000,000 Marks. In Germany in 1923, such an astronomical number of coins was only used for small change. However, if calculated at the value of the Mark in 1914, perhaps all the gold in the world would not be enough to mint such a coin.

Greece under German and Italian occupation during the Second World War is another terrible example of inflation. In 1941, the highest denomination banknote was 1,000 Drachmas. By 1944, the highest denomination had reached 5,000,000 Drachmas.

The bank has collected 60,000 kinds of currency, enough to represent the currencies of various periods in history. There are Egyptian round coins from 5,000 years ago, to the Roosevelt dimes issued in January of this year, the earliest Chinese banknotes from the Ming Dynasty, and counterfeit coins from the Central Reserve Bank.

In addition, there are many other kinds of currency: woodpecker skulls, elephant tails, Mauser bullets, tea bricks, fish hooks, whale teeth, rubber balls, etc.

The highest denomination check on display is $22,500,000, issued by Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, and the lowest denomination is one cent, issued by the famous blind woman Helen Keller.

Hygiene and Medicine

### The Origins and Whereabouts of Typhoid Bacteria

— Guo Keda, Chen Wenlong

Before discussing the pathogen of typhoid fever, we must first rectify the name. In ancient Chinese medicine, there is a famous book called "Treatise on Cold Damage Diseases," in which the symptoms discussed do include a portion that belongs to true typhoid fever, but many parts describe other acute infections. Even in the early days of the development of scientific medicine in the West, it was not easy to distinguish typhoid fever from other similar diseases clinically, so the ancient records are all mixed up and unclear. Since the modern development of bacteriology and serology, this rather complex problem has been clarified. Now we know that typhoid fever refers to an acute infectious disease caused by *Salmonella typhi*. A type of typhoid fever with more severe symptoms is caused by *Salmonella paratyphi*, called "paratyphoid fever." *Salmonella paratyphi* cannot be distinguished from *Salmonella typhi* morphologically, but there are obvious differences in biochemical and serological reactions. As for epidemic typhus, it is a completely different disease. Although the symptoms are similar in some respects, the differences are still many, and the pathogen itself is completely different from *Salmonella typhi*. The pathogen of epidemic typhus, "Rickettsia," was discovered by Ricketts. This small body cannot be stained with ordinary bacterial staining methods, nor can it be cultured on ordinary bacterial culture media. It can only reproduce in living cells, so its culture cannot be achieved without using living animals or tissue culture methods or chicken embryo methods. Moreover, the transmission of typhoid fever is directly through the mouth into the gastrointestinal system, while epidemic typhus is transmitted by fleas.

*Salmonella typhi* is very small and cannot be seen with the naked eye. It can only be observed under a microscope, with an axial shape, a short rod shape, and slightly blunt round ends. It has more than ten flagella around it, so it can move vigorously.

*Salmonella typhi* is easy to culture. It can be grown smoothly in a slightly alkaline or in a medium like Xima's. The most suitable breeding temperature is about the same as normal human body temperature. But in nature, it is also possible to find opportunities for its survival. In ice, typhoid bacteria can survive for several weeks, so unsterilized ice cubes or unclean ice cream are dangerous for transmission. Its resistance to heat is relatively weak. A temperature of 56 degrees Celsius maintained for two minutes can kill it. It dies instantly in boiling water at 100 degrees, so there will be no typhoid bacteria in boiling water.

The main source of transmission of *Salmonella typhi* is the patient's stool and urine, because the patient's stool and urine can contain a lot of *Salmonella typhi*. Sometimes, even though the disease has healed, the stool and urine can still carry bacteria. There are also some healthy people whose bodies have strong resistance, or who have been vaccinated, so even though bacteria have entered the body, there are no clinical symptoms. These two types of people, who appear healthy but actually carry bacteria, are very dangerous to society because they can transmit the bacteria to other healthy people.

The transmission route of typhoid fever is exactly in line with what we often say: "Disease enters through the mouth." Bacteria enter people's digestive systems directly or indirectly through water, food, fingers, and utensils.

Water is a very important part of transmission, because water often comes into contact with feces and urine. Rivers, ditches, and spring water have the most opportunities to be contaminated with bacteria. In cities, if there are cracks in the water pipes, tap water may also become a transmission medium, so drinking raw water always carries the risk of contracting infectious diseases.

In terms of food, milk is a good culture medium for typhoid bacteria. At the same time, after the bacteria grow in milk, there are no obvious changes, making it difficult for drinkers to detect, so it is easy to spread the typhoid bacteria. Most of the typhoid bacteria come from workers carrying bacteria in the dairy farm, or from subscribers to typhoid fever. Milk bottles from these patients carry the bacteria out. In addition to milk, raw tea and shellfish may also be sources of transmission. Fruits, melons, and raw water have an inseparable relationship with flies, so they are very dangerous for transmission. Flies are naturally the most frightening. They mechanically attach bacteria from feces to their hairy feet and then distribute them to food, or directly send them to our lips, thus accelerating the spread of transmission.

Fingers and tableware, due to contact with patients, or because they touch raw water and flies, are easily used indirectly as transmission media.

After *Salmonella typhi* enters the oral cavity, it passes through the stomach and reaches the lymphatic tissue of the intestinal tract. Because of the proliferation of bacteria, the local lymphatic tissue becomes swollen. From the mesenteric lymphatic vessels, the bacteria enter the blood circulation, so in the first week of the illness, we can culture *Salmonella typhi* from the patient's blood. After the kidneys are invaded, the bacteria can migrate from the blood to the urinary system, so we can often find bacteria in the patient's urine. In the intestinal tract, after the intestinal lymphatic tissue is destroyed, there are large amounts of *Salmonella typhi* in the stool. These bacteria are excreted from the patient's body with the stool, and then begin to infect another healthy person, or are eliminated.

The gallbladder is the most suitable place for *Salmonella typhi* to grow and reproduce. After the bacteria multiply in the gallbladder, they continue to flow with the bile into the small intestine, and then are excreted from the body with the stool from the intestinal tract. There are two possible routes for *Salmonella typhi* to reach the gallbladder: one is to flow back up the bile duct from the small intestine to reach the gallbladder; the second is to reach the gallbladder from the blood through the liver circulation. *Salmonella typhi* in the gallbladder is very difficult to eliminate. Up to now, the medical community has not found a suitable drug that can eliminate the bacteria in the gallbladder. At present, the only solution is to perform surgical gallbladder removal.

The prevention of typhoid fever can be carried out in three aspects: first, handling carriers; second, cutting off the transmission route; and third, enhancing personal resistance.

The method of handling carriers is to first find out the people who carry the bacteria, then explore the transmission parts of the carriers, and then give appropriate treatment. Carriers may be seemingly healthy people or patients. The transmission part may be the gallbladder, the intestinal tract, or the urinary system. Each patient who has recovered from typhoid fever should go through a fairly long observation period until it is definitively proven that they no longer carry the bacteria. This requires close cooperation between the patient's family and health workers.

The methods of cutting off the transmission route can be divided into: 1. Cook all food and drink thoroughly; 2. Exterminate flies; 3. Disinfect all objects and excreta that patients have come into contact with; 4. Meticulously disinfect the tap water supply; 5. Check whether chefs and workers are carriers.

The method of enhancing human resistance is to not only pay attention to personal hygiene on weekdays, but also to carry out preventive injections. The vaccine is killed *Salmonella typhi*. After being injected into subcutaneous tissue, it can cause the body to produce an antibody against *Salmonella typhi*. This antibody can help the human body to extinguish *Salmonella typhi* that has invaded the body. Preventive injections are usually given in three doses, with an interval of seven days between each dose. After the injection, the antibody concentration in the blood gradually increases. Only injecting once or twice, or the interval between two injections is too long, can affect antibody production. In areas where typhoid fever is prevalent, preventive injections should be given once a year.

In summary, we can say that the knowledge of the pathogenic bacteria of typhoid fever is already quite complete. In these aspects of the nature of the bacteria themselves, the mode of transmission, and the methods of prevention, bacteriologists and epidemiologists have done their best. Now the question is "action." How to extinguish the prevalence of typhoid fever is not only a matter of personal hygiene, but also the efforts of public health authorities, which are truly of great decisiveness.

### The Pathogen and Vaccination of Typhoid Fever

— Wang Jiamu

Typhoid fever is an acute infectious disease, also known as enteric fever, because lesions in the lymphatic tissue of the intestine cause systemic symptoms. In the past, Hippocrates, a giant in the Greek medical community, described this original disease. In the mid-18th century, this disease was classified as a group of typhoid diseases. Ancient Chinese medicine also has a "Treatise on Cold Damage Diseases," the meaning of which is roughly the same, all of which are old history in the development of medicine. By the 19th century, the disease was gradually separated and determined from other febrile and delusive diseases.

In 1880, Eberth found the pathogen of this disease—*Salmonella typhi*—in the spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes of a patient who died. At the same time, Robert Koch stained the material sections of the pathogen. Later, in 1884, Gaffky cultured *Salmonella typhi* on human culture medium and distinguished it clearly from other Gram-negative bacilli in the intestine. *Salmonella typhi* is a small bacillus 1-3n long and 0.5-0.8n wide. Gram staining is negative, no spores, motile, with eight to fourteen flagella all over the body, can grow on common culture media, is an aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacterium, can decompose glucose, maltose, and mannitol, etc. Dry sterilization takes one to two days, wet heat sterilization requires 55°C for one hour or 60°C for a quarter to twenty minutes, and can survive for months in clean water, in raw cold food, and even in ice.

This bacillus infects the human body and develops symptoms in one or two weeks. In the early stage of the illness, the bacteria are in the blood. After a week, the bacillus can be found in the patient's urine and stool.

Those who have had this disease and recovered have resistance to this disease in their bodies and are not easily infected with this disease again. This is called immunity. In 1908, Russel used this phenomenon for artificial immunization. That is, injecting a small amount of killed *Salmonella typhi* into the human body, so that they do not suffer from the disease but gain immunity to the disease. After multiple group tests and military use, the results were very good. To this day, we still use this method to prevent this disease. A qualified typhoid vaccine should be made from strains containing only Vi antigen. The correct injection method (three doses, the first time half a cc, the second and third times one cc each, with an interval of five to seven days between each time) can maintain the immunity obtained for two to three years. For the second immunization injection, intradermal injection can also be used, using a tenth of a cc of vaccine, injected intradermally once.

### The Main Causes of Death from Typhoid Fever: Complications

— Xue Sishi

Complications share a similar meaning with the colloquial terms "病上病" (illness upon illness) or "轉病" (transformed illness). For example, the popular saying "轉痢　藥醫" (once dysentery transforms, no medicine can cure it), although not scientifically accurate, conveys the dangerous implication of "transformed illness," which echoes the serious medical understanding of complications.

During this summer season, typhoid fever is prevalent. Moreover, this year, at the beginning of summer, the number of patients is already significantly higher than in previous years, and the future death toll is bound to be alarming! If we investigate the causes of death from typhoid fever, complications account for the majority. This is because typhoid fever is highly susceptible to complications from various serious conditions. These complications can manifest in the affected small intestine or due to systemic poisoning caused by bacteria, etc. The occurrence of complications is most commonly seen in the second and third weeks of the illness. I will now list the subtle signs of each complication, selecting the most important ones, in order of their importance, for the reference of families with patients, to avoid unnecessary misfortunes!

(1) Intestinal Perforation

Intestinal perforation is one of the main causes of death from typhoid fever. It is more common in men than in women, but rare in children. This condition is most commonly seen in the third week of severely ill typhoid patients. The onset of subtle signs can be as rapid as thunder and lightning. The patient suddenly feels severe abdominal pain, most often in the lower right quadrant, followed by groaning. The body temperature drops, while the pulse and respiration increase. The patient constantly tosses and turns in bed, crying out in pain! The pallor of the face and the tense expression of pain often leave those attending the patient at a loss. In a short time, the severe abdominal pain may increase or decrease, after which the abdomen becomes distended like a drum, and the body temperature rises again. The patient is anxious, restless, covered in cold sweat, exhausted, and exhibits signs of collapse! At this time, if the family does not seek proper medical attention or delays due to seeking help from gods and ghosts, the patient will suffer from exhaustion, breath faintly, and soon pass away! In the early stages of the illness, in addition to the symptoms mentioned above, a physician's examination may reveal abdominal muscle rigidity and localized tenderness. Subsequently, the abdomen becomes distended with a large amount of gas, and there is widespread abdominal tenderness, indicating symptoms of acute peritonitis!

(2) Hemorrhage

Hemorrhage is also a serious complication of typhoid fever. Its level of danger is directly proportional to the amount of blood loss. It occurs in about seven or eight out of every hundred typhoid patients, and patients are mostly adults. Intestinal bleeding usually occurs in the early part of the third week of typhoid fever. If the bleeding is minor, there may be no other symptoms except for tarry black stools. However, with massive bleeding, the patient's temperature drops sharply, even below normal. The pulse becomes weak and rapid, blood pressure drops, respiration becomes shallow and rapid, the face becomes pale, and the extremities become cold and clammy. Blood tests show a decrease in hemoglobin. The patient is weak, anxious, and restless. In severe cases, the patient goes into shock. If appropriate treatment is not received, or if bleeding is continuous, the consequences are dire, and life or death is uncertain!

(3) Acute Cholecystitis

Cholecystitis is an important complication of typhoid fever, but it affects fewer patients, so it is not as emphasized as intestinal perforation and intestinal hemorrhage. Patients experience sudden pain in the upper right abdomen, sometimes with chills, vomiting, increased temperature, and rapid pulse. The abdominal pain is continuous and variable, but is mainly located in the upper right quadrant. It is very tender to the touch, and the abdominal muscles are rigid. Subsequently, jaundice becomes evident, making the diagnosis clear. If the symptoms continue to worsen, and there is a bulging in the upper right abdomen, then the gallbladder is extremely distended. If medical attention is not sought quickly, there is a risk of rupture and the development of peritonitis.

(4) Pneumonia

The complication of pneumonia during the course of typhoid fever is also a serious condition. It can be either bronchopneumonia or lobar pneumonia. The symptoms are not always consistent. Chills, shivering, increased temperature, severe chest pain, rapid breathing, tight chest, and coughing up rust-colored sputum are all common phenomena.

(5) Thrombosis

Thrombosis of the veins is not as serious as the above-mentioned complications, but it is also commonly seen. The most common site of involvement is the left femoral vein. Patients often feel swelling and pain on the inner side of the left groin or left leg during the recovery period, with limited movement. Upon palpation, a hard, cord-like mass can be felt under the skin, with slight tenderness. This is what is known as femoral vein thrombosis. Thrombosis itself is not serious, but if the area is bumped or massaged, a small piece of the thrombus can break off and travel through the bloodstream to the pulmonary artery, causing a pulmonary embolism that can be fatal.

(6) Other Complications

Other complications of typhoid fever, such as endocarditis, myocarditis, pericarditis, typhoid meningitis, parotitis, nephritis, cystitis, periostitis, osteomyelitis, otitis media, beriberi, confusion, etc., can also be found, but they are rare and do not need to be described in detail.

(7) Relapse

It is commonly said that a relapse of an illness is always more severe, but this is not the case with typhoid fever. Clinical experience shows that the symptoms are often milder and last for a shorter period of time. Relapses usually occur one to two weeks after the fever subsides, and at most three weeks. Therefore, patients should avoid strenuous activity or overeating during the recovery period, to avoid being hasty and not achieving the desired result.

In summary, I have briefly analyzed the main symptoms as follows:

(1) Sudden and persistent severe abdominal pain -- an important sign of intestinal perforation!

(2) Tarry black stools or large amounts of blood in the stool (not caused by hemorrhoids) -- a sign of intestinal hemorrhage

(3) Sudden drop in temperature, while pulse rate and respiration increase -- an important symptom of intestinal hemorrhage or intestinal perforation!

### The Typhoid God: The Carrier

— Qiao Shumin

If there really is a "Typhoid God" in the world, then it is the "carrier."

Carriers, also known as "菌郵" (bacterial postmen), are people who carry certain pathogens in their bodies. They themselves show no symptoms of the disease but can transmit infectious diseases to others, harming others without benefiting themselves.

In nature, we have discovered more than 250 types of pathogenic microorganisms. Most of them cannot live independently or survive in the outside world for long, and need to seek shelter in humans or animals. The role of animals in storing and spreading bacteria will be discussed in a later issue. Today, let's first talk about the human aspect.

Pathogens entering the human body can cause disease under certain suitable conditions, which is a well-known fact. However, the severity of symptoms can vary greatly, like the light spectrum in physics, with different degrees of intensity. Severe cases can lead to death quickly; slightly severe cases cause suffering in bed; milder cases allow people to move freely outdoors; even milder cases may not be recognized by clinicians (Subclinical cases); and the mildest cases show no symptoms at all, known as "healthy carriers." From a treatment perspective, severe cases are important and require special care. However, from a prevention perspective, their importance is the opposite. Seriously ill patients are quarantined and confined to bed, limiting their opportunities to spread infectious diseases. Even if their movement is not greatly restricted, people know that they are ill and take precautions. However, carriers and extremely mild cases move freely without restriction, and others have no suspicion, often becoming the main source of spreading infectious diseases. Isn't it appropriate to call them "messengers of epidemics" or "Typhoid Gods?"

This issue focuses on introducing knowledge about typhoid fever. Please consider the following story of a "typhoid carrier" as an example.

In 1901, there was a female cook in the United States named Mary Mallon. She contracted typhoid fever and unfortunately recovered (unfortunate for others at that time, as you will see later). A month later, the laundress in that household also contracted typhoid fever. In 1902, Mary Mallon moved to another household to cook. Remarkably, within just two weeks, the laundress at the brothel also contracted typhoid fever. Subsequently, the family, one after another, had seven people infected with typhoid fever.

By 1904, she had moved to Long Island to work as a cook for a family. This household had a total of seven servants, four of whom contracted typhoid fever.

In 1906, she went to work for another family. This family had a total of eleven people, and within just one week, six of them were infected with typhoid fever. At this point, Mary Mallon was first suspected of having a tendency to spread the disease. So she simply changed employers again. Who knew that she had been gone for less than half a month and a laundering woman at a brothel had collapsed.

In 1907, she went to work in a New York family, and within two months, two more people were infected with typhoid fever. So, over these five years, she directly infected no fewer than twenty-six typhoid patients.

The New York City Department of Health detained Mary Mallon in a hospital on March 19, 1907, to prevent her from infecting others in society. For three years in the hospital, stool tests consistently showed high levels of typhoid bacilli. But she could not endure the loneliness in the hospital, and took advantage of the situation to escape, disappearing without a trace. Until 1914, she was spotted at Sloane Hospital for Women in New York, still working as a cook. In the spring of 1915, the hospital experienced a typhoid outbreak, with twenty-five cases, mainly among medical staff. Mary Mallon was strongly suspected, so she was granted leave to go out, never to return, changing her name to hide away. After much investigation by the Department of Health, she was finally detained again.

Subsequently, epidemiological investigations revealed that Mary Mallon had not only transmitted the above-mentioned illnesses, but had also transmitted others on many occasions; and that the 1903 typhoid fever epidemic in New York (a total of over 1,300 cases were caused by contaminated water) was also caused by this Mary Mallon.

"When the Typhoid God descends, people and animals suffer." There are countless carriers like Mary Mallon in China. Throughout the year, typhoid fever is rampant everywhere. How to ban and manage carriers requires wise officials; how to be careful in prevention depends on everyone. "Illness enters through the mouth," and so is typhoid!

Spring and Autumn

### Ancient Yangguan Melody

— Yu Jingwen

A friend studying literature and history in England wrote recently, saying that he had seen a handwritten copy of the ancient Yangguan Melody in the British Museum, and he copied the verses of the handwritten copy in the letter.

In academic circles, this can be said to be a discovery of great value. According to my friend's letter, this Tang Dynasty manuscript originally came from the Dunhuang Grottoes and was obtained during Stein's archaeological expeditions in the Western Regions. We have long known that the remote Dunhuang is a famous holy place in the history of Eastern art. This Tang Dynasty manuscript was probably brought to the Western Regions by merchants or soldiers from the Tang and Song dynasties.

Wang Wei's Weicheng Melody, also known as Yangguan Melody, originally titled "Sending Yuan Er on a Mission to Anxi," was already widely popular in the Tang Dynasty and was a famous song widely sung by the people. Reading the original lyrics carefully, we only feel that the lyrics are sad and poignant, and the melody is lingering. It is a work of Wang Wei's entire life revealing his natural talent. At that time, the Tang Dynasty was prosperous, and customs were tolerant. Poets wrote each verse, and it immediately spread everywhere. Whether in public or private banquets, or in the houses of courtesans, they competed to sing it, creating a trend. Bai Juyi's Changqing Collection has a line that says, "The most pleasant is the song over the goblet, pearls strung together in song!" Song Qiude also said, "When Tang people bid farewell, they must sing the Yangguan Three Refrains." This shows the widespread popularity of the Yangguan Melody in the Tang Dynasty.

However, the so-called "three refrains" singing method seems to have been lost by the Song Dynasty. The popular singing method was no longer the "ancient tune." Su Shi's Dongpo Zhilin says: "The old tradition is the Yangguan Three Refrains, but in today's singing, each line is only repeated once. If the whole song is spoken of, it is repeated four times, which is not correct. When I was in Mizhou, a magistrate named Wen Xun said that he had obtained an ancient version of Yangguan, the sound of which was gentle, turning and sad, unlike what I had heard before. Each line is sung again, but the first line is not repeated, which shows that the Tang version of the three refrains was probably like this." This so-called repeating each line but not repeating the first line is very different from the Tang Dynasty manuscript in the British Museum. The Tang Dynasty manuscript is like this:

Weicheng is lightly raining in the morning, over and over again, the guest house is green with willow trees, so close. I urge you to drink one more cup of wine, leaving Yangguan, there will be no old friends. (First refrain)

Weicheng is lightly raining in the morning, the guest house is green with willow trees, so close. Willow trees so close, I urge you to drink one more cup of wine, leaving Yangguan, there will be no old friends. (Second refrain)

Weicheng is lightly raining in the morning, the guest house is green with willow trees, so close. I urge you to drink one more cup of wine, one more cup of wine poured down, leaving Yangguan, there will be no old friends. (Third refrain)

It can be seen that in the Tang Dynasty manuscript of the ancient Yangguan Melody, only the last three words of each of the first three lines are repeated, and the fourth line is not repeated. This is not only different from Su Shi's statement, but also different from the "continuous three refrains" and "string of pearls three refrains" mentioned in Tian Yiheng's Yin Guan Three Refrains. Furthermore, all we know now is the three refrains singing method, and there is no way to verify the "musical score" of the ancient version. The singing of the Yangguan Melody in the Tang Dynasty was probably accompanied by the pipa, which can be proved by the ancient poems that say: "Parents need to sell their daughter's body lightly, one pipa song travels ten thousand miles; playing to Yangguan, they all clap their hands, they don't know that it is a song of broken heart!"

The ancient Yangguan Melody was accompanied by the pipa, and the pipa score seems to have been lost. This reminds me that in the summer of 1927, I happened to be at Tsinghua University in Peiping and mentioned the problem of the score of Yangguan Three Refrains to my teacher Liang Qichao. At that time, Mr. Liang Qichao had the idea of asking Zhao Yuanren to compose a new song. Later, because Mr. Wang Guowei committed suicide, Mr. Liang Qichao hurriedly left the school, and the Shui Mu Tsinghua was covered in a deep layer of sorrow, and Mr. Yuanren never completed this song. Thinking of it now, I can't help but feel lost!

Summer 1946

### Travel Expenses (Fiction)

— Ying Feicun

Beside the pillow, a quiet, reflective voice:

"I think it's better to go out. It's not like living in the countryside before, where people always said you had high ambitions and a strong backbone, refusing to eat the Japanese' food. Now that we've won, if you keep waiting, what will people think? There must be a friend or two outside you can rely on."

"Yeah, I've wanted to leave for a long time."

The decision to leave has been made. The wife squats on the floor in front of the bed, packing the suitcase. The husband holds the youngest daughter, watching the two older sons play with flashcards.

The wife, as always, in a quiet, reflective voice:

"I've mended all your socks. I don't know how you wear your socks. They're always torn at the toes. You're such a big man, you should know to trim your toenails when they get long."

He turns to look down at her. She also looks up at him with a reproachful glance. As their eyes meet, the reproachful look in her long eyelashes immediately turns into a slight smile. He smiles too.

"What are you smiling at?" she asks.

"What are you smiling at?" he asks.

"I'm smiling at you: 'Lazy, your toenails are like shovels.'"

"I'm smiling at you, so busy preparing for my departure, but I—"

"But what?"

"I don't even know where the travel expenses are coming from."

The wife lowers her head and sighs: her husband's response.

"How much money do you need to get to Shanghai from home?"

"How much? Five thousand to Zhoushan, about five thousand from Zhoushan to Ningbo, and more than ten thousand for a deck ticket from Ningbo to Shanghai, plus food and transportation expenses. It'll cost at least forty thousand in total."

"Forty thousand?" The wife's eyes widen.

After a moment of silence, she says as if she has found a solution: "Oh, we're still short ten thousand."

"It's really not easy to leave. Even if I can leave, what about the family?"

"Don't worry about that. I bought a half-stone of rice the other day. That should be enough for the four of us for two or three months. For vegetables, I've pickled a few salted yellow croakers. That shouldn't be a problem either. School will start in half a month. The salary should be enough to make ends meet. I'm just worried that you're still short ten thousand yuan, and I don't know if you'll have a job or not when you get to Shanghai."

Suddenly—

"A'Han, oh, Miss Zheng." A booming voice accompanies a tall man as he enters the door.

The housewife quickly stands up. The couple, all four eyes staring at the visitor.

"Oh, who is it? It's Mr. Wang."

"Oh, Brother Zikang. I didn't expect it to be you! How did you come to be here?"

"I'm in Shanghai, handling the wholesale of dyed clothing to Haimen. It's really a coincidence, the wind direction is wrong, and the sailboat is docked here. I knew you lived here, so I made a special trip ashore to see you. As soon as the wind turns south, I'll have to go back to the ship. How are you? A'Han, you've been a recluse here for four years, it's time for you to go out and get active."

"Yes, Mr. Wang, he's preparing to go to Shanghai the day after tomorrow. Look, I'm packing his luggage for him."

"You have a few little babies now? Are these all of them?"

"Three." The husband replies, "Brother Zikang, it's still you, capable both in the pen and on the battlefield, always making money in business."

"It's definitely better than teaching. You should have listened to me and changed professions a long time ago."

"Doing business is at the mercy of the wind and waves, it's quite hard work." The wife interjects, as she pours tea for the guest.

"I actually enjoy this kind of life. How old are the three little babies?"

The wife says, "The oldest is only six, the second is five, and the one I'm holding is only two. A'Mang, A'Chao, say hello to your uncle."

The children shyly say, "Uncle." So quietly that they can hardly hear themselves.

"Good, good, be good, A'Han, you have a house full of children, you're very lucky. If I were you, Miss Zheng, no offense, three is enough. You have to have capital controls from now on, haha. Come, let uncle hold you." The big man snatches the girl from his friend's arms. "Be good, be good, smile for uncle, good." He holds the child in his left arm, and pulls out a few bills from his long pocket with his right hand. "Here, two bills each, uncle will give you money to buy candy."

The couple say in unison, "What are you doing?" The father wants to snatch the money back from the children's hands, but the children are holding it tighter than any treasure. The big man waves his hand, "It's not for you, why are you being so polite?"

After that, they talked with emotion about each other's recent situations after their separation and about friends related to each other. Looking at the sky outside, the friend says: the wind direction will probably change soon, and the ship will leave at any time, and he is relieved to see them. He must go now. No matter how hard they try to keep him, a chorus of "goodbyes" accompanies the tall man as he leaves.

"Mommy, Mommy, that uncle gave me four thousand yuan." The eldest child proudly holds up the bill in front of his mother.

"I also got four thousand," the second son also says rather proudly.

"Baby got four thousand too." The little girl refers to herself as baby, her pronunciation is unclear, and a small round face breaks into a smile.

The husband sighs: "Even children are so materialistic these days."

"Come," the mother takes the eldest child's hand, "You are all good children, give the money to Mommy."

"Um, I want to buy a ball." The eldest says, hiding the hand holding the money behind his back, tilting his head.

"I want to buy scallion candy." The second one is greedy.

The mother coaxes them: "Daddy is going to Shanghai tomorrow, we'll let Daddy take the money and buy you little leather shoes, little leather shoes are so pretty."

"Good, good, little leather shoes, little leather shoes!" The two brothers believe it's true, and are overjoyed.

"Baby wants little leather shoes too." The little daughter points to the broken cloth shoes on her feet: "Want good ones."

"Okay, one pair each, two pairs in total. Daddy, don't forget. Now, you all give the money to Mommy."

The three children immediately rush to present their only private property to their mother like a "donation."

That night, the wife slips a bundle of bills into her husband's suit pocket. She smiles and looks at her husband sideways and says, "When you get a job and earn a salary, don't forget the kids' little leather shoes."

The husband looks at the gold ring that is missing from his wife's ring finger, and then looks at the three children's sweet smiles in their dreams, and his eyes turn red. …

### The Dynamic Trends of Our Nation's Music Scene

— Contribution

Amidst the post-recovery atmosphere, the dynamic trends of our nation's music scene are a concern of the new cultural sphere. I present here a brief report on the findings of my investigation:

Regarding organizations, the National Conservatory of Music (originally located in Qingmuguan, Chongqing) has begun its eastward relocation. As the highest music institution in our country, it is supposed to be located in the capital as a matter of principle. However, it has not been easy to find suitable premises in Nanjing, so it has been decided to temporarily move to Changzhou, using the former Japanese school there as its premises. Dean Wu Bochao and some of the teaching staff have already embarked on a boat to Shanghai and are currently en route; another group of students is traveling by road via Xi'an and should arrive in Changzhou soon.

In addition to the National Conservatory of Music, Chongqing also has a National Music Branch School, headed by Dai Cuilun. After the victory, this branch school was renamed the National Shanghai Conservatory of Music and is scheduled to move to Shanghai during the summer vacation. The former Shanghai National Conservatory of Music's school building in the city center is currently occupied by a Japanese garrison, and the interior has been heavily damaged. Whether the basic structure can be repaired and used is still a question.

The third branch of the Shanghai Temporary University Preparatory Class (i.e., the Music Class) is nearing completion of its studies and will conclude next month. After the completion, qualified students from this class will be admitted to various national music schools.

The National Fujian Conservatory of Music was originally located in Yong'an, with Tang Xue as the principal. After the victory, the school moved to Fuzhou and is temporarily located in Jianxing Village outside the East Gate. It is reported that the school's building construction fees have been approved by the Ministry of Education, and land has been acquired within the city of Fuzhou for construction.

The Northwest Conservatory of Music was originally in Xi'an and was established during the Anti-Japanese War, headed by Zhao Meibo. It is reported that the school plans to move to Beiping and be renamed as national; Zhao has already arrived in Beiping to prepare everything.

The private Shanghai Conservatory of Music has been established for eight years, headed by Ding Shande, Chen De, and Chen Youxin. Their spirit is commendable and has been praised by society. After the victory, it was announced that the school was closing down due to internal disagreements. All who knew this felt regret. It is heard that there might be a possibility of reopening in the near future.

Realizing the necessity of unity, the Shanghai music community has organized the Shanghai Musicians Association, with Ma Sicong publicly elected as the chairman, and Chen Hong, Ding Shande, Cao Shijun, Yu Xinru, Li Delun, Xu Jinqing, etc., as standing directors. The association has already organized several concerts, and its address is located at No. 31 Ma Sinan Road.

The Shanghai Municipal Government Orchestra was formerly the Shanghai Municipal Council Orchestra, with a history of over forty years. It has more than sixty members, and its performance record is the best in the Far East. At one point, it was on the verge of shutdown due to financial difficulties. It is heard that the current director of the orchestra, Xie Xi'en, has been trying to persuade the municipal authorities to increase funding and continue operating it.

The Shanghai Music Magazine Society was organized by Chen Hong, Ding Shande, etc., with the aim of publishing the "Music Magazine" monthly. The magazine has been advertised for a while, but it has not yet been published. It is understood that it is still in the proofreading stage. The format is 16mo, with over forty pages, including musical scores in addition to text.

The Shanghai branch of the Poetry and Music Association has a music group, which is overseen by Ma Sicong and Chen Yuan.

The Nanjing Lizhi Society has established an orchestra and is recruiting many members in Shanghai. It has already begun its performance work, headed by Zhu Chongzhi.

The Chongqing China Symphony Orchestra plans to move to Nanjing.

On the personal front, Ma Sicong will be going to Guangdong in the coming days and, after a short stay, will come to Shanghai again.

Wu Bochao is en route to Shanghai, while Dai Cuilun, Chen Tianhe, Jiang Dingxian, Zhang Yan, Lao Jingjian, Man Fumin, Shi Yigui, and others are all in Chongqing waiting for a boat to Shanghai.

Those who have already arrived in Shanghai include Ren Zhengqian, Han Zhongjie, Ma Sijing, Ma Siju, Liao Fushu, Huang Muli, Ma Guolin, Guan Yixuan, etc.

Pianist Li Huifang has gone to the United States for further studies. It is reported that soprano Lang Yuxiu will also be going to the United States.

In the past two months, Shanghai has seen an unprecedented number of musical performances. These include Situ Huacheng's violin recital, Yun Min's vocal concert, Chen Zhengping's piano recital, and Qi Jun and Xu Mianqing's joint vocal concert at the YMCA. At the Lyceum Theatre, there was Ma Sicong's composition concert (two days), the Musicians Association's joint concert (two days), Li Yingzhi's vocal concert, and the collaborative performance between Ma Sihong and Dong Guangguang organized by Jiaoxing.

Pianist Wu Lezhong, who has been absent from the stage for a long time, is rumored to be considering giving a solo recital due to the encouragement of relatives and friends. Looking at the above, it can be seen that musicians will gather in Shanghai after the war, and the Shanghai-Nanjing area will inevitably become the center of Chinese music.

### Art and Freaks

— Zhongyuan

I live with a woman who is constantly pregnant. When her ten months were up and the time came for her to give birth, I was filled with joy, thinking I would see a snow-white, chubby baby. Unexpectedly, with a cry of "Ah!", the pregnant woman birthed a strange thing that was headless, limbless, and shaped like a stone. I was greatly disappointed and sighed repeatedly.

The "freaks" of art are almost the same situation.

Some people wonder why artists are generally compared to women in labor? Of course, the creation of a work of art must go through a considerable period of gestation. However, a beautiful rose, from bud to bloom, must also go through a considerable period of gestation. So, why not compare artists to more lovely rose bushes?

I think the key lies here: A rose plucked from the tree, after leaving its mother plant, immediately withers and fades. But an infant, after being born, will cry and laugh, and continue to grow.

Therefore, the necessary condition for a work of art is two words: life! In other words, anything that has life, even if its appearance is not good, or even if it is missing an eye or has an extra finger, is still an artistic infant. On the other hand, something that has no life, like a stone, even if it has a beautiful appearance and complete limbs, can only be called a "freak."

### A Chronicle of Depression (1)

— Hu Shanhu

This article is a sincere account by Hu Shanhu of the current state of culture. Entitled "A Chronicle of Depression", it is divided into five chapters: "The Depression of the Reader", "The Depression of the Writer", "The Depression of the Editor", "The Depression of the Publisher", and "The Depression of the Environment". The reasoning is thorough, the analysis is rigorous, and it can serve as a reference for cultural workers. It will be published sequentially in this journal.

Editor

The Depression of the Reader

All reading material is spiritual nourishment for people. Spiritual hunger is probably even more difficult to endure than physical hunger. During the eight years of occupation, we suffered spiritual hunger because, under the control of the enemy and puppets, there was no beneficial spiritual nourishment. Drinking poison to quench thirst is, after all, done by a minority. Those who know it is poison and are willing to drink it should correct themselves. That is to say, those who are spiritually hungry should have proper nourishment. Unexpectedly, in the past year, the reality has not been like that.

Looking back at the publishing industry in the past year, we can see the lack of such nourishment. What books have the major publishing houses, which rank first in the country, published? None! Some are just a few books transported from the rear, which are either outdated or thin and basic, not worth chewing on. If the major publishing houses are like this, the smaller ones are even worse. Some have closed, some have changed their businesses, and others are selling stationery or other colorful things to maintain their business. The magazine world seems livelier. However, a large part of them are yellow publications, which have become poison and are not enough to serve as spiritual nourishment. Those that are not yellow can be divided into two categories: one is propaganda, with distorted theories and distorted records, not worth looking at, and even poison is not worth hearing. The other is commercial products, which, although they are not yet yellow, and even have some works that can become legitimate nourishment, are ultimately aimed at commerce, that is, aimed at making money. When people eat them, they will not be completely beneficial to the body and mind. If you are not careful, you will inevitably mix in some poisonous ingredients. Of course, there are those that fully meet the standards, but they have become as rare as phoenix feathers, and are greatly insufficient! Looking at the newspapers, who knows what today's newspapers are like: propaganda comes first, and entertainment comes first. Those that pay attention to the spiritual needs of the readers are also a small minority. At the same time, those who read newspapers may only want to know some news and do not want to find spiritual nourishment in them. Thus, newspapers are disconnected from the people's spirit. There are a few supplements that may not be for propaganda or entertainment purposes, but still, like magazines, how many are there after all? They are as few as the stars in the sky!

We readers are now in an extremely depressed state! We are spiritually hungry, and we want nourishment. But we can't find anything to eat. We don't want to eat poison, and we don't want others to eat poison. But what can we do? When will our hunger end?

Who should we blame? First, we should blame the writers, why they, with their writing skills and convenience, do not give us proper spiritual nourishment! They are not unaware of what is proper and what is improper, but they have obliterated their conscience and desperately turned black and white upside down, making propaganda recklessly, or simply seeking to deceive manuscript fees, only seeking that the manuscripts have sales, while neglecting the mission that a writer should have. They are scum, thieves of the cultural world, and we want to denounce them! To drive them out! We want them to wash their minds and produce proper spiritual nourishment!

The readers' depression is entirely the responsibility of the writers!

Serial Novel

### Double Flying (6)(7)

— Zhao Qingge

Last night, Lihua thought about going on stage to sing with great composure. She treated going on stage to sing as if she were dealing with a daily required course. She felt there was no difference.

Today, Lihua's life began to enter a new stage.

Zhang Xian held Lihua's hand in one hand and Liyun's hand in the other, and entered the backstage of the theater. Mrs. Mo and Second Mrs. Weng carried their "stage costumes" bags and followed behind them. The people backstage who knew Zhang Xian all nodded and greeted him. Some even congratulated him, saying, "Xianzi" (Zhang Xian's nickname is Xianzi, which also refers to the strings of a huqin), you should be busy!" Zhang Xian just kept smiling with squinting eyes. Right at the corner of the room where Shi Yulou was putting on makeup, a small table was set up for the two sisters to sit and laugh. While calling people to bring water for washing their faces, he himself was busy placing things on the table for them.

The backstage was in a complete mess, with men and women, crowded together, "chirping and chattering," all looking three parts human and seven parts ghost, none of them were well-dressed or handsome. Adding to this was the dimness of the room, under the dim light, the colorful painted faces flickered, and they were holding guns and knives, which really made people feel uneasy!

"What is this place? The rooms are not rooms, with pieces of wood here and pieces of wood there, separated into several small pigeon coops. The people are not people. Strange shapes and strange voices." Lihua thought, looking at this unfamiliar environment, feeling very annoyed and afraid! But, even if it is hell on earth, Mrs. Mo has brought her here, and she has no choice but to stay down! Stay down! So, she simply closed her eyes and stopped looking at everything. Letting Zhang Xian play with her, like playing with a small wooden puppet, a small puppet.

Liyun was not as sensitive as Lihua. She liked to look at everything and ask about everything. She felt a novel interest in everything that happened. When Zhang Xian was helping her with her makeup, she happily gazed at herself. She felt that her appearance had completely changed, and even she herself was amusing.

The gongs and drums on the stage sounded. This is called "naotai" (noisy stage). After that, it was the opening performance of the troupe. After the opening performance, it was time for Liyun's "Catching and Releasing Cao" to take the stage. Zhang Xian first instructed her on the side, and then rushed to the front stage to play the huqin for her.

Liyun stepped onto the stage without being approached. But when she saw the black mass of people sitting in the pit under the stage, she couldn't help but panic! "The scene" (the accompaniment orchestra of Peking opera is called "scene") repeated twice, and Zhang Xian stamped his feet anxiously and glared his eyes. After a long while, Liyun slowly calmed down and opened her mouth, but she had unknowingly forgotten several lines. But she managed to sing it down. Backstage, she quickly told Lihua, saying, "The black mass of people in the pit are looking at me, it's so scary! It scared me so much that I forgot all the lyrics."

Lihua showed no expression after hearing this. She seemed to have "a well-thought-out plan."

Zhang Xian rushed to the backstage again, introduced the person who played Emperor Zhengde in the "You Long Xi Feng" (Playing Phoenix in the Dragon's Presence) to Lihua, and instructed that person to take good care of her and help her with some of the lyrics when necessary. Zhang Xian was relatively particularly concerned about Lihua's performance on stage because he had great hopes for Lihua.
