### Song Ziwen and Others Meet with Marshall; Current Situation Being Discussed; Representatives of the Democratic League and Political Consultative Conference Arrive in Beijing from Shanghai

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] Premier of the Executive Yuan, Song Ziwen, and Minister of Transportation, Yu Dawei, met with Special Envoy Marshall for about an hour at noon on the 28th. It is reported that the content of the talks was related to the ceasefire in Northeast China. Special Envoy Marshall may meet with the representatives of the Democratic League who have just arrived in Beijing from Shanghai in the next few days.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] Minister of Military Affairs Chen Cheng, in his speech at the memorial week yesterday, reviewed the current situation and said that according to the current situation, the trend of the overall situation is still no more than "peace," "war," and "delay." However, if we want complete peace to be truly realized, we must abide by the ceasefire agreement, restore transportation, and reorganize the army in accordance with the army reorganization plan to show sincerity for peace. Chen also said: Given the current situation of the country and the suffering of the people, the overall situation really cannot afford to be dragged on.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] Reliable sources: If the Communist army abandons its attempt to seize Northeast China by force and voluntarily withdraws from Harbin, Qiqihar, and other places, the government will still uphold its original intention of being magnanimous and may temporarily designate the territory of Xing'an Province as a defense zone for the Communist army and provide certain conveniences to allow the Communist army to engage in army reorganization in accordance with the army reorganization plan. As for political issues in Northeast China, national sovereignty and the opinions of the people of Northeast China should be respected. After the government completes the takeover work and establishes popular opinion organizations, it will handle matters in accordance with the law and resolutely opposes specialization. Xing'an Province is adjacent to the Soviet Union and Mongolia to the west, and borders Heilongjiang to the north and northeast, and Liaobei Province and Chahar to the east and south. It covers an area of ​​more than 249,000 square kilometers and governs six counties, including Hulun, Luyan, Qigan, Yalu, Shiwei, and Buxi, as well as the Solun Administration Bureau, with Hulun (i.e., Hailar) as the provincial capital. The current chairman of the Xing'an Provincial Government appointed by the National Government is Wu Huanzhang.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] Huang Yanpei, Shen Junru, Liang Shuming, Zhang Bojun, Zhang Junmai, and other five representatives of the Democratic League and Political Consultative Conference arrived in Beijing from Shanghai at 2 p.m. on the 28th. Qi Yanming, Secretary-General of the Communist Party delegation, Ye Duyi of the Democratic League Office, and Wang Tongye of the Political Council all went to the station to welcome them. After the five representatives got off the train, they went to the No. 15 Lanjiagang residence to rest. They issued a written statement to reporters, stating: The civil war in Northeast China is a rare tragedy in many years. The Democratic League, the Youth Party, and the non-partisan representatives of the Political Consultative Conference unanimously demand a ceasefire and are willing to work together with all parties to promote peace. Luo Longji telegraphed the Democratic League office in Beijing today, saying that he will fly to Beijing tomorrow. According to well-informed sources, once the representatives of the various parties gather in Beijing, a preparatory meeting of the Political Consultative Conference will be held to exchange opinions and jointly seek the realization of peace.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 28th] The domestic situation seems unlikely to have bright prospects within a week. A certain observer told reporters that although the rainstorm has passed, the dark clouds have not yet dissipated. A prolonged stalemate may lead to the clouds clearing and the sky brightening, or it may brew a new rainstorm. Chairman Chiang's stay in Shenyang has reached its sixth day, and there is still no news of his return to the south. Now it is rumored that the Chairman will go to Changchun tomorrow for inspection. All of this is enough to show the government's firm determination to take over sovereignty in Northeast China. On the Communist side, they believe that withdrawing from Changchun is already their concession. They are afraid that it will be difficult for them to accept the case of withdrawing from Harbin. Regarding the transportation issue, the government insists that a ceasefire must first restore transportation, while the Communist side insists that a ceasefire must come before discussing the restoration of transportation. There is still a considerable distance between the two sides' opinions. If this distance does not gradually shorten, Marshal Marshall seems unlikely to go to Shenyang. Because if he goes to Shenyang, he can only succeed and not fail, and he will certainly not want to make a futile trip. The observer pointed out that the situation within Shanhaiguan is also not to be taken lightly. The flames of war in Jilu, Subei, and eastern Henan may be rekindled at any time.

[United Press, Nanjing, 28th] Zhang Junmai said: There is considerable hope for a peaceful solution. Since the National Army recovered Changchun, there has been no real war in Northeast China. In fact, the war has already stopped. As long as the situation in Northeast China is resolved, everything else will naturally be resolved accordingly. The three-point proposal for peace in Northeast China proposed by the Democratic League may need to be revised to suit the situation. The Communist side seems quite willing to stop fighting.

### The Central Government Orders Active Restoration of the Two Major Trunk Lines of Pinghan and Jinpu; The Houma Group Discusses the Restoration of the Tongpu Railway

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 28th] The local transportation authorities have received a telegram from the Central Government, ordering the active restoration of the two major trunk lines of Pinghan and Jinpu.

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 27th] After the government representative of the Marshall Group, Shen Guofu, and the American representative, Lun Tai'er, paid a visit to Governor Yan at noon on the 27th, they discussed the restoration of transportation on the Shicun-Yuncheng section of the southern Tongpu Line. It is reported that after Lun gave a frank report on his collection of the Communist side's opinions on the restoration of the road, he solicited the government's opinions. Finally, it was decided that the People's Public Enterprise Association would take over the Tongpu Road as a people's public enterprise, and the transportation agencies of the Communist side would each send personnel to Linfen to directly discuss it. The group will supervise it in accordance with Order No. 4 of Hezi. According to reporters, the Communist side requested that the government provide materials for the repair of the road, and the Communist side would control the railway management rights.

### The Military Mediation Department Will Strengthen Mediation Work in Northeast China

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 28th] The Military Mediation Department is now preparing to strengthen mediation work in Northeast China. If an agreement on Northeast China is reached in the short term, the Military Mediation Department will send additional groups to work. At present, the work of the Northeast Executive Group is also expected to gradually unfold. The 28th Group has already departed from Kaiyuan for Sipingjie, and the 8th Group may go to Changchun. However, the issue of sending a group to Harbin has not yet been agreed upon by the Communist Party.

### The Devastation of Dajian Gou Village; No Sign of Human Life; Representatives from All Sectors of Jinan Go to Inspect

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 28th] Dajian Gou Village, after being plundered by the Communist army, is full of devastation. Nine out of ten houses are empty, and there is no sign of human life. No less than a thousand people from nearby villages were brutally killed by the Communist army. All sectors of Jinan are outraged by the Communist army's heinous atrocities. More than 20 representatives from Jinan's news media and various people's organizations rushed to Dajian Gou on the 27th to inspect. The village is more than 30 miles south of Jinan and is located at the southern foot of Xinglong Mountain. There were more than 1,000 households in the village. After the Communist army's massacre on May 18, only a few weak and disabled villagers remain in the village. When reporters and inspectors entered the village, dozens of villagers were lying prostrate among the rubble on the side of the road, crying and complaining, which was unbearable to hear. Among them was an 80-year-old man named Ma Naigang, whose son was killed by the Communist army and two grandsons were taken away by the Communist army. He beat his chest and wailed, almost fainting. Chen Zhongde, a 64-year-old villager, had stab wounds on his head and abdomen. Zhang Jingzhou, a 74-year-old, became insane because his house was burned down by the Communist army and his property was destroyed. Every day, he carries a wooden fork he found in the ashes and wanders around the village, muttering to himself, crying and laughing erratically. When he saw the reporter, he said that the farmhouse he had painstakingly managed since the 28th year of Guangxu had now been reduced to ashes, and all that remained was this half of a wooden fork. After he finished speaking, he laughed wildly, then wailed to the sky. After being comforted, he staggered away. According to the temporary village chief, in mid-May, more than 100 refugees from villages in the southern suburbs of Jinan passed through here. Because the road was blocked, they temporarily lived in the area east of the ditch in the village. At 9 p.m. on the 18th, when the Communist army attacked the village, all these 100+ people were killed. Some of the bodies were tied with huge stones and thrown into the well. Most of the bodies were taken away by the Communist army when they retreated in the morning of the 19th in order to reduce traces. Several days later, the entire village was still filled with the stench of corpses and blood. According to statistics, from the 16th to the 19th, about 400 to 500 people were known to have been killed in the village and the nearby Dianzi, Liangxianggou, Houjia Village, Yigong, and the Quanlu, Laopogou, Xicun, Fujia Village, and Xixianzhen and Zhujia Village southwest of Huangluxian, which are more than ten miles to the south. More than 600 people were captured and their whereabouts are unknown. In addition to the more than 30 bodies left under the West Mountain of Dajian Gou and the more than 20 bodies recovered from the well, the remains of the rest could not be found. Twenty-six houses in the village were burned down. According to the National Army stationed in the area, the Communist army that attacked the village was the "4th Division of the 4th Army," with more than 2,000 soldiers of Kong's "regiment," well-equipped. Its artillerymen and machine gunners were all Japanese. After retreating, the Communist army is still hiding near Menger Mountain, which is more than ten miles west of the village.

### Soviet Relations with the CCP Are Not Good

[United Press, Changchun, 28th] After the reporter met with six prominent figures among the 160 Soviets here, I had the impression that the relationship between the Soviet and CCP personnel were not as good as expected by outsiders. During the five weeks the CCP occupied Changchun, according to these Soviets, they looted the Chinese, and also robbed Soviet people. Once, the Communist army forcibly requisitioned the building of the Soviet Foreign Trade Bureau in Changchun. When the Soviets refused, the Communists rudely told them: "Since you only deal with the central government, please contact the central government directly about this house." These Soviets claimed that based on the Sino-Soviet Treaty, Moscow only recognized the government led by Chairman Chiang, which made the Communist regime in Yan'an lose face.

### Xiong Bin Will Fly to Beijing Soon to Attend the Financial and Food Conference

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 28th] Chairman Chiang and his wife went to the 91st Rear Hospital at 4:30 p.m. on the 28th to comfort the officers and soldiers wounded in the takeover of the Sipingjie and Changchun areas, for more than an hour. They then went to the Shengjing Hospital to comfort Zhao Linjing, the wounded division commander of Liaoyang. At 9 p.m., he summoned Lin Kesheng, Director of the Military Medical Department, and gave instructions. In the 91st Rear Hospital, the Chairman and his wife asked each wounded officer and soldier about their injuries and suffering after the injury, and ordered the hospital to prepare fruit for the seriously wounded soldiers and pay attention to nutrition so that they could recover their health as soon as possible. When Madame Chiang Kai-shek saw that the soldiers had no bed sheets, she often ordered the hospital to purchase them for washing, and instructed the nurses to pay attention to maintaining cleanliness. Some soldiers were moved to tears when they saw the Supreme Commander and his wife personally come to comfort them. When the reporter asked a soldier who was crying what his pain was, he said: There is no pain, but he could not help but cry because he had survived nine deaths and received the comfort of the commander-in-chief and his wife. After leaving the 91st Rear Hospital, the Chairman and his wife went to the Shengjing City Hospital to comfort Zhao Linjing, the division commander of the 91st Division, and told him to take good care of himself, and gave him several apples that the Executive Yuan had prepared for the Chairman and his wife, repeatedly telling him to take care and then left. When leaving the hospital, the entire staff and students of the hospital's affiliated nursing school lined up to ask for instructions. The Chairman encouraged them to study hard and serve the country.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 27th] The 27th was the first day that Chairman Chiang ordered the establishment of a secret complaint box to receive letters of complaint from the people. A total of five letterboxes were set up, and each was guarded by a dedicated person.

On the 27th, the five secret complaint boxes received a total of 36 letters.

[Another Telegram] Madame Chiang Kai-shek summoned Zhao Churuiyan and other preparatory members of the Northeast Branch of the Women's Guidance Committee on the 27th and gave three points of instructions on the work of the women's movement in Northeast China: (1) Launch campaigns to comfort wounded soldiers; (2) Strive to eliminate illiteracy among women; (3) Conscientiously promote childcare.

### Ceasefire Order Carefully Issued by the Military Mediation Department

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] It has been widely rumored in Beijing for days that negotiations on a ceasefire, through the constant mediation of Special Envoy Marshall, have resulted in a partial agreement, and a ceasefire order will be issued soon. This newspaper's reporter believes that this move is worthy of attention, and has consulted various parties on this matter. It is reported that, given the recent situation in various places, the number of conflict incidents within Shanhaiguan has indeed decreased day by day, but the Communist army north of the Yangtze River is still frequently mobilized, and the situation is still not too optimistic. The American and government representatives of the Military Mediation Department, in view of the fact that previous ceasefire orders and road resumption orders have rarely been effective, have adopted an extremely cautious attitude towards the issuance of orders to avoid losing credibility. The rumor that the ceasefire order will be issued today or tomorrow is a bit premature.

[United Press, Beiping, 28th] All newspapers in Beiping today unanimously published on the front page news that the "Big Three" of China have signed a ceasefire agreement in Northeast China in Nanjing. The Xinmin Daily reported that the agreement was signed yesterday in Nanjing and will be officially issued within days. The Yishi Daily said that Du Yuming's troops, "for the sake of peace," have ordered their troops to stop advancing towards Harbin and Jilin.

### National Army Recovers Yongji and Panshi; Communist Army Concentrates in Qiqihar

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] According to a senior general, after the National Army recovered Changchun, it could have taken Jilin and Heilongjiang in one fell swoop, but because the government sincerely wants to peacefully take over Harbin so that the Communist army can retreat calmly and the people of Jilin and Heilongjiang can suffer less pain, the important strongholds within 90 li to the east, west, and north of Changchun's periphery, such as Jiutai, Wanbaoshan, Yongji, Hailong, and Dehui, have indeed been gradually taken over by the National Army. The National Army's recovery of Hailong, which is only 85 li from Jilin, has continued to progress yesterday. If there are no obstacles along the way, it will reach the outskirts of Harbin as early as tonight or at the latest tomorrow night.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 28th] A person from Shenyang said today: The National Army in Changchun continues to consolidate its peripheral advances. One route has crossed Wanbaoshan, where a tragic incident occurred before September 18, and another route is advancing rapidly along the Jichang Road, having crossed Jiutai. Yongji, the capital of Jilin Province, will be captured soon.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 28th] Our accompanying reporter in Yongji telegraphed at 3 p.m. on the 28th. The National Army completely recovered Yongji, the capital of Jilin Province, and Panshi to its south at 4 p.m. on the 28th. The Communist army fled eastward and northward from Yongji. Order was immediately restored in Yongji after the National Army moved in, and the lights were turned on at night. The Xiaofengman Power Plant may have been occupied by the National Army (Note: Xiaofengman is one of the largest power plants in Northeast China, supplying a very wide area. If it is recovered, it will be of great benefit to the power supply in Northeast China).

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 27th] Liaoyuan, 26th Telegram, The 91st Division of the 71st Army on the left wing of the National Army crossed Liaoyuan and continued to advance north

Wolongtun, 20 kilometers from Liaoyuan, was recovered. The place was defended by the 1st and 2nd regiments of the Communist Security Forces.

### The Allied Reparations Committee Will Establish a Branch in Shenyang; Meier Flies to Shenyang to Prepare for Pauley

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 28th] Meier, a member of the staff of Pauley, the American representative of the Allied Reparations Committee, flew to Shenyang yesterday to prepare for Pauley's investigation.

### Principal Japanese War Criminal Sakai Takashi Indicted by Army Headquarters Military Tribunal

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] The number of war criminals delivered and detained by various parties to the Military Tribunal of the Army Headquarters for the Trial of War Criminals has recently increased to over thirty. The military prosecutors have interrogated them one by one and telegraphed relevant parties to collect evidence of the crimes committed by each. It is reported that the important war criminal Sakai Takashi has been investigated by Prosecutor Chen and indicted. A public trial will soon be held at the Military Tribunal of the Army Headquarters at Gongzi Hall. The following is a summary of the indictment against the accused: Defendant Sakai Takashi, age 60, from Hiroshima Prefecture, military officer.

Facts of the Crime: (4) Sakai Takashi was a young and vigorous member of the Japanese military. He was promoted from second lieutenant to lieutenant general, dedicating his life to the movement of aggression against our country. In the eighth year of the Republic [1919], he was dispatched to China, serving successively as a military attaché and assistant official at the Japanese Legation in Beijing, a member of the Japanese General Staff Headquarters, an assistant official to Lieutenant Colonel Akimura, a military attaché stationed in Hankou, commander of the infantry regiment of the Tianjin Garrison, chief of staff of the China Garrison Army, attached to the Kwantung Army Headquarters, director-general of the Asia Development Board Liaison Department, and commander of the 23rd Army. He was, along with Doihara Kenji and Umezu Yoshijiro, a key figure in implementing Japan's policy of aggression. In the political arena, he oppressed or induced local officials to reject our central government and its political power in the North China and Inner Mongolia areas, attempting to create puppet governments under his control and occupation of our national territory. In the economic arena, he interfered with our relevant administration, engaged in large-scale armed smuggling, and used various military and political advantages to traffic in large quantities of narcotics, poisoning our people in order to eliminate their resistance capability. He used military force as the main pillar, first threatening with military might, and when no pretext was created, he temporarily used military force to coerce our military and political authorities to accept his various harsh conditions, and afterwards, he again used military force to compel their strict enforcement, and continued to create new facts, step by step encroaching, leading to the July 7th Incident [Marco Polo Bridge Incident]. When this large-scale war of aggression broke out, he then served as brigade commander, army commander, and attached to the Kwantung Army Headquarters, engaging in the war of aggression, fighting battles in the north and south of our country. On December 8th of the 30th year of the Republic [1941], taking advantage of the unpreparedness of the British army in Hong Kong, our allied nation, he attacked and captured Hong Kong. During this war of aggression, he instigated his subordinates to violate international treaties and customs, implementing various atrocities: (1) Massacring large numbers of innocent Chinese and British people; (2) Inflicting torture on civilians; (3) Rape; (4) Enslaving or depriving the people of occupied areas of their civil rights; (5) Wantonly destroying property. Furthermore, he transported three hundred boxes of books from the Fung Ping Shan Library of the University of Hong Kong, one hundred and eleven boxes of rare books and paintings from the National Central Library, and twenty boxes of Western books stored in the Wing On Godown in Hong Kong to the Tokyo General Staff Headquarters and Shanghai. In addition, he created a puppet regime in Guangzhou and organized a puppet peace army, implementing the vicious policy of using Chinese to control Chinese, intending to overthrow our government, instigating the traitorous elements to occupy national territory, and eliminate our resistance capability, in order to swallow up our country and then dominate the world. His consistent actions in implementing the policy of aggression against China continued until after Japan's surrender.

Evidence of the Crime: (1) The defendant engaged in espionage work; (2) He engaged in aggression in various aspects such as military, political, and economic affairs; (3) He launched a war of aggression; (4) He presided over various atrocities. All have evidence and the defendant's confession records during the investigation period to prove them. The defendant cannot be separated from Japan's entire policy of aggression and acts of aggression. Not only should he bear criminal responsibility for the atrocities directly connected to himself, but he should also bear responsibility for all crimes arising from this policy of aggression that do not violate his original intentions. He damaged peace, extinguished humanity, and violated international treaties and laws, truly a heinous crime, with conclusive evidence and no room for denial.

### Executive Yuan Held Routine Meeting Yesterday; Approved Appointments of Two Vice Ministers of Economic Affairs; No Further Discussion on Adjusting Civil Servant Salaries

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] Resolutions of the Executive Yuan routine meeting this morning: (1) The revised National Defense Ministry Organizational Law was passed and submitted to the Supreme National Defense Council for review. (2) The proposal to adjust civil servant salaries was submitted to the Supreme National Defense Council for review. Also passed were appointment and dismissal matters: (1) Xiao Zheng was appointed as Political Vice Minister of Economic Affairs, and Pan Xulun as Administrative Vice Minister. (2) Gui Yongqing was appointed as head of the Military Delegation to Germany. (3) Xu Shihu was appointed as president of Shanxi University. It is heard that the specific figures for the adjustment of civil servant salaries passed today were not announced. There are two rumors: (1) Base salary increased to 250 times, and living allowance increased to 90,000 yuan. (2) Base salary increased to 400 times, and living allowance increased to 100,000 yuan. It is heard that the proposal still needs to be submitted to the Supreme National Defense Council for a final decision next Wednesday. The rumor that the base salary will be increased to 500 times and the living allowance will be increased to 150,000 yuan is inaccurate.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Yunwu returned to Nanjing from Shanghai at 6:30 this morning. After a short rest at his residence, he went to the Executive Yuan to attend the routine meeting. The appointments of the two Vice Ministers appointed by Wang, Xiao Zheng and Pan Xulun, were both approved at the routine meeting. They arrived at the ministry for work in the afternoon, extremely busy. When reporters visited, they were unable to meet them. It is heard that they will hold a reception for the Nanjing press at a set time to report on the current work of the Ministry of Economic Affairs.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] The newly appointed Political Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Xiao Zheng and Administrative Vice Minister Pan Xulun have been approved by the Executive Yuan. Minister Wang Yunwu also returned to Nanjing last night and attended the Executive Yuan routine meeting this morning. It is learned that there are very few changes among the senior officials and directors within the Ministry of Economic Affairs. However, Director of the Control Department Li Jinglu and Director of the Electricity Department Zhang Jiayu have already taken up other positions. Director of the Enterprise Department Zhuang Zhihuan also has other assignments, and Minister Wang was unable to retain him and is looking for a successor.

[Another Dispatch] The issue of salary adjustment, which all public school teachers and staff across the country eagerly desire, was not brought up for discussion at the Executive Yuan routine meeting on the 28th. Only several cases of appointing vice ministers of the Ministry of Economic Affairs were passed. It is reported that the suggestions of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans regarding the adjustment of civil servant salaries have been delivered to the Executive Yuan, but the Executive Yuan has not yet formulated concrete measures, so it was not brought up for discussion on the 28th. Although Executive Yuan Secretary-General Jiang Menglin stated in Shanghai and at the Resident Committee of the Senate that the Executive Yuan is considering salary increases and the issuance of valuable goods, Premier Song has not made any public statements on this matter. At a time when prices are soaring and life is difficult, public school teachers and staff generally hope that the Executive Yuan will accept the suggestions of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans in order to provide them with a chance to catch their breath.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] According to Xiao Zheng, the newly appointed political vice minister, he intends to decline the position at the center.

In November of the 32nd year [1943], he filled the position of President of the Sino-Japanese Industrial Company. In March of the 34th year [1945], he became a standing member of the Puppet North China Political Affairs Commission and the chairman of the North China Cooperative Enterprise General Society, robbing our economic resources and supplying the enemy's military use.

### The Knot of International Politics Stuck in a Stalemate: After Reading Molotov's Speech

The four deputy foreign ministers have been meeting again in Paris since yesterday to carry out all the preparatory work for the next four foreign ministers conference. According to the final decision of the last four foreign ministers conference, it is planned to reopen the four foreign ministers conference on June 15 to decide on the date of the convocation of the European twenty-one nation and conference, which must not be later than the end of July; therefore, the four deputy foreign ministers conference held in Paris has once again become the focus of world attention. However, what is the future of the international conferences to be convened in the coming months? It will depend on the attitudes of the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States. In the last four foreign ministers conference, because the opinions of the Soviet Union and the United States were divided, each insisted on their own opinions and refused to give in, resulting in a stalemate, which led to the breakdown of the conference. Afterwards, both sides issued statements and shirked responsibility to each other, and even slandered each other, which made us dare not be optimistic about the future of the next foreign ministers conference.

First, US Secretary of State Byrnes returned home and delivered a radio address to the people of the country, reporting on the proceedings of the four foreign ministers conference; and solemnly declared the foreign policy of the United States, saying: "Our pursuit of peace can only be regarded as just beginning. We are determined to fight to the end for the political and economic peace of Europe, the Near East, and other regions. We will continue this work in peace conferences or in the various councils of the United Nations. Our goal is not to seek territory or reparations for the United States, but to seek peace for the whole world. The world must know that peace can hardly be built on the basis of revenge and greed. Only peace based on justice and public reason can be maintained for a long time." In his tone, he placed the responsibility for the failure of the four foreign ministers conference entirely on the Soviet Union. At that time, the Soviet government did not respond, but only published an article in the Soviet New Era magazine, attacking the British and American governments for tending towards power politics and adopting "atomic diplomacy"; and said that the attitude of the British and American representatives in the four foreign ministers conference towards the most sensitive issues was not based on the true interests of the survival of the countries concerned, nor on international security and lasting peace, nor on the intention to protect the interests of some small countries; but their intentions were elsewhere, which was the main reason for the failure of the Paris foreign ministers conference.

From this, it can be seen that the opinions of the United States and the Soviet Union are diametrically opposed, unable to get close; and they are mutually contradictory, escalating, and endless. Although international political commentators are shouting for the Soviet Union to understand and appealing for US-Soviet cooperation, they have never been able to reverse the adverse currents between the two countries. For example, in the United States, some people have launched the establishment of the US-Soviet Association, seeking mutual understanding from mutual understanding; some people advocate lending money to the Soviet Union, seeking political understanding from economic cooperation; and even some people advocate concluding a friendship treaty with the Soviet Union, using the treaty to guarantee the friendship between the United States and the Soviet Union. Former Undersecretary of State Welles also said: "The failure of the Paris foreign ministers conference was due to the failure of the United States and the Soviet Union to agree on the basic nature of the future new world order. Today's world is shrouded in the sorrow of fear and suspicion, because there is a lack of constructive leaders among the countries, which makes the clouds thicker. The Soviet Union attempts to expand its defense areas, and recognizes this as the only practical sense of security. The United States should make a final effort to make the Soviet Union believe that only by adopting a "One World" policy can its security be guaranteed." But what effect do these actions and expressions of the United States have on the Soviet Union? All those who long for the post-war world to enter a new era of democratic peace hope that the United States and the Soviet Union can truly reach an understanding, so as to establish world peace on a solid foundation; therefore, what is the true intention of the Soviet Union? It is more urgently needed to thoroughly understand. Marshal Stalin's speeches on May Day and Victory Day on May 9 did not satisfy our desires; but the speech made by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov to reporters from Pravda the day before yesterday clarified the Soviet Union's true intentions towards the outside world.

Molotov's speech had three meanings: (1) The Soviet Union still adheres to its original position on the attitude towards the peace conference; that is, the twenty-one nation peace conference cannot be convened until the four major powers have reached a preliminary agreement on the European peace treaty; that is, it opposes the proposal of US Secretary of State Byrnes: "When the four foreign ministers conference fails to reach an agreement, the issue of the European peace treaty will be submitted to the United Nations mechanism for discussion." And he denounced this proposal as a violation of the Potsdam Declaration. (2) The Soviet Union still holds an uncompromising attitude towards Britain and the United States. Molotov not only condemned Britain and the United States for dealing with the Soviet Union with threats and intimidation, but also said that Britain and the United States launched an offensive against the Soviet Union in the four foreign ministers conference. The United States, with the support of Britain, wanted to set up naval and air bases everywhere in the world, attempting to impose its will on other countries. (3) Britain and the United States used economic assistance as a means to try to control Italy and other countries, making them tools for promoting capitalist policies: therefore, Britain and the United States should be responsible for the failure of the Paris foreign ministers conference.

Molotov's speech was straightforward, frank, and unceremonious. He attacked the US diplomatic policy, almost to the point of escorting the driving carriage, disregarding diplomatic rhetoric and etiquette; it can be seen that the relationship between the Soviet Union and Britain and the United States has reached the stage of close combat; even diplomatic courtesies are no longer needed. Looking forward to the reopening of the four foreign ministers in Paris on June 15, the prospect is even more bleak. Not only is the European peace conference postponed indefinitely, but even if it is convened, it is difficult to have a satisfactory result. If the international situation continues to stalemate like this, if there is no way to break the stalemate, there will never be world peace, and the security of all countries will be even less guaranteed. We have to worry about the future of the entire world. However, the crux of today's international problems lies in the irreconcilable contradiction between the Soviet Union and Britain and the United States, and the confrontation between the two major blocs is becoming more and more undisguised. In the eyes of sharp-eyed political diplomats, they should be able to see it clearly; how to reverse the adverse currents of today's international politics? The first is to eliminate the suspicion and contradiction between the Soviet Union and Britain and the United States. Ideologically, the Soviet Union is a socialist country, and Britain and the United States are capitalist countries, just like water and fire are incompatible, and there seems to be no room for compromise; but there are many common points between communism and democracy. We can just study these common points, explore each other, and understand each other, so as to avoid the deepening of mutual doubts. In fact, the Soviet Union, for its own security, is desperately expanding its "circle of friends" to enhance its "sense of security"; making Britain and the United States feel uneasy. This is because Britain and the United States, for the sake of world security, also want to set up naval and air bases everywhere in the world, and keep the secrets of atomic energy, refusing to disclose them, in order to consolidate the foundation of world peace; the Soviet Union also feels the threat from Britain and the United States. Therefore, the two sides attack each other, suspect each other, and cannot control themselves. No matter how you explain it? It is always impossible to make the suspicions of both sides completely dispel. In fact, what both sides need most is peace, and the second is also peace; if they can immediately restore the friendly spirit during the war, cooperate sincerely, and jointly rebuild world peace, it is what both sides are seeking day and night. Therefore, from this point of view, it is not impossible to persuade the Soviet Union and Britain and the United States to release their grievances and reconcile.

In short, the knot of today's international stalemate lies entirely in the irreconcilability between the Soviet Union and Britain and the United States. If we want to break the current stalemate, if we want to reverse the adverse currents of the international situation, we must seek understanding and cooperation between the Soviet Union and Britain and the United States. It is useless to convene international conferences blindly. Looking at a series of international conferences after the war, either they are discussed but not decided, or they are decided but not implemented. Not a single one has not failed. It can be seen that convening international conferences again will still not break the current stalemate. For the current plan, the only way is to find a way to seek understanding and cooperation between the Soviet Union and Britain and the United States; the most important thing is to stop the "propaganda war" between the two sides, so as to avoid stimulating the emotions and nerves of the people on both sides.

### French Army Invades Border Incident: Siam Decides to Appeal to the Security Council, America Sends Personnel to Investigate the Incident Location

[Our Newspaper News] London, 28th Broadcast: The British Foreign Office officially announced tonight: Siam has decided to appeal to the United Nations Security Council, requesting the Security Council to immediately investigate the fact that the French army has invaded and attacked Siamese territory. A British Foreign Office spokesman stated: The British side agrees to include Siam's complaint in the Security Council's agenda.

[Reuters, Washington, 27th Dispatch] A State Department spokesman stated: After the incident on the Siamese-Vietnamese border, we have not yet received definite reports. However, based on the information we have obtained, the French army's intrusion seems to be only a "border incident." Bangkok has dispatched an American observer to inspect the location of the incident. It is reported that the location is not within the land disputed by Siam and Vietnam.

[Central News Agency, New York, 27th Exclusive Dispatch] News from Bangkok states that although the Siamese government has accused the French army of invading the Siamese border to the Security Council, the United Nations Secretariat has not yet received a report from the Siamese government regarding the French army's invasion. According to Article 25 of the United Nations Charter, although Siam is not a member of the United Nations, it has the right to file a complaint if it declares in advance that it accepts the obligation to peacefully resolve disputes stipulated in the Charter. However, because the United States and Britain are planning to propose Siam's accession to the United Nations soon, Siam's accusation against France this time is causing them anxiety. Therefore, the new dispute between France and Siam may be mediated by the United States and Britain, rather than being included in the Security Council's agenda. A French government spokesman stated at the United Nations today that the French military actions along the Siamese-Vietnamese border were due to the "excessive repulsion" of Siamese who had invaded the Vietnamese border, and the French authorities stationed in Vietnam had repeatedly broadcast warnings to the Siamese government to suppress such attacks, but have failed to do so.

Villages Looted

[United Press, Bangkok, 27th Dispatch] The Siamese government officially announced tonight that it will submit a detailed report to the United Nations agencies regarding the French army's looting of Siamese villages. The village is located upstream of Long Kai on the Mekong River. At 6:00 AM on Sunday, eighty French soldiers crossed the river to rob one household, and then eight hundred people crossed the river to search and loot the entire village for three hours, leaving only at noon.

[United Press International, Bangkok, 28th Dispatch] According to news from the Siamese-Vietnamese border today, the Siamese police-civilian mixed force has driven out the French army that invaded Taibo City on the Mekong River.

Distant Cause of the Dispute

[Reuters, New York, 27th Dispatch] A French spokesman stationed at the United Nations agencies said yesterday that the military action that the French side could take on the Siamese-Vietnamese border was due to the Siamese crossing the border into Vietnam to engage in significant provocations. The French authorities in Vietnam repeatedly warned the Siamese side by radio not to engage in such border crossings, but the Siamese government turned a deaf ear. Observers here pointed out that the Siamese-Vietnamese problem occurred as early as 1941, when the Siamese, relying on the power of Japan, invaded and occupied one-fifth of the territory of Vietnam and Cambodia, resulting in fierce battles. On January 28, 1942, Bangkok, Hanoi, and Vichy simultaneously announced that both sides had accepted Japanese mediation, and the war ceased.

It is said that the prosecuting attorneys "have the assistance of hundreds of assistants, investigators, and specialists" to collect evidence for half a year, while the defense lawyers do not have such ample time. The actions of which the defendants are accused occurred over several years, and "mostly involve documents, treaties, and agreements spanning nearly forty years," so they need to be studied in detail.

### Righteous Views from American Newspapers: America Should Deeply Understand Asian History and Culture; The Foundation of Chinese Civilization Endures Through Time; Japanese Civilization is a Branch of Chinese Civilization

[United Press, San Francisco, 27th Dispatch] The San Francisco Chronicle published today: "The American people as a whole have a rather superficial understanding of Asia and its complex history, culture, and politics, and it is urgent to have a deeper understanding. Past events have proven that we may engage in wars in Asia, and in this era of tools that can travel thousands of miles in an instant, America and Asia are only an arrow's shot away from each other. In the future, we should know more about the real situation in Asia. American schools all neglect the study of Asia, which is shameful. Their responsibility lies in transforming this neglect into understanding. The Institute of Pacific Relations has dispatched many Far East experts to form a committee to study the textbooks commonly used in American universities. It has found that the part of the world history textbooks that describes Asia accounts for only 7%, the part of the American history textbooks that describes the Far East accounts for only 3%, and the part of the geography textbooks that describes Asia and its hundreds of millions of people accounts for only 10%. According to the report of the Institute of Pacific Relations, general textbooks all have arrogant tones, calling the neighboring countries across the Pacific Ocean inferior and backward countries. Our current task must start from scratch. All textbooks with arrogant tones and those that promote narrow patriotism should be shelved, so that university students can understand the foundation of Chinese civilization and the reasons for its enduring through time, and understand that Japanese civilization is a branch of Chinese civilization, but it has lost its original features, and what exactly are its differences." The newspaper concluded: "If the next generation does not understand Asia more deeply than we do, then the consequences will be unimaginable."

### "Officers" and "Soldiers" Are Collectively Called "Military Personnel"; Standing at Attention and Military Salutes Should Also Be Abolished: Recommendations of the US Army Review Committee

[United Press, Washington, 17th Dispatch] The Eastern United States Army held a meeting in Washington, D.C. The Eighth Air Force Commander, famous General Doolittle, served as chairman. Today, he made a recommendation to Army Secretary Patterson, advocating the abolition of the terms "officers" and "soldiers," and collectively calling them "military personnel," so as to eliminate the differences in officialdom and society. So that the soldiers will no longer have grievances about unequal treatment. The differences in pay, promotion, leave, awards, and food that have always existed must also be completely corrected, and military leaders must find ways to improve their standards. Standing at attention and military salutes should be abolished, except when on duty in the military and serving in occupied areas abroad. Any military regulations or military habits that make the hierarchy of official ranks an obstacle to social interaction must also be declared invalid. The committee's review report is 53 pages long, and its conclusion states: "Americans are unhappy with any system that allows a certain class of people to obtain rights without labor, and they also dislike the forced social stratification of the two parts of the military." The report also stated that there are two main reasons for the poor relationship between American officers and soldiers: one is that a small number of non-commissioned officers are leading poorly, and the other is that differences in officialdom and social treatment cause resentment. Regarding the improvement of officer leadership, the committee advocated that all officers who serve as commanders, except for technical personnel, must receive one year of military training. The promotion of officers should be based on merit, not qualifications. Patterson said that some of the recommendations in the report have already been implemented.

[United Press, New York, 28th Dispatch] A monkey store here recently transported a batch of monkeys from India.

In a short while, more than a hundred monkeys jumped out of the windows. There were monkeys everywhere on the street. This exhausted the police and the fire brigade. The team members, holding wire ropes, were divided into groups to try to catch these "escaped" monkeys. There were more than 3,000 people watching the excitement on the street.

### US Two Major Secret Weapons: In Addition to "Germs," There are Also Atomic Poison Gases. Federation of Scientists Requests Details.

[United Press, Washington, 28th] Dr. Higinbotham, Chairman of the Federation of American Scientists, declared today at a preparatory meeting of the Federation's Atomic Energy Information Committee that there are currently at least two major secret weapons that scientists believe pose the same danger to humanity as the atomic bomb. One is germs, and the other is so-called atomic poison gas. Dr. Higinbotham did not disclose details about the two secret weapons, but stated that, for the sake of peace, Congress should request the War Department to disclose details about the two secret weapons. Atomic bombs can have passive defenses, such as evacuating cities and factories at a cost of $300 billion, but germ warfare can be used to cut off the people's food supply, and materials with radioactive energy can endanger civilians hiding in air-raid shelters. Scientists believe that the public has the right to know the content of these secret weapons, because these weapons are not just an invention, but a threat to the entire world and a major revolution in human knowledge.

### Chairman's Concern for Shanghai Residents' Food Supply: Handwritten Instructions to Thoroughly Investigate Causes of Rapid Price Increases. Anyone Found Manipulating or Hoarding Will be Executed. Authorities Reviewing Loaned Rice Dealers' Accounts.

[Reported by this newspaper] According to reliable sources, Chairman Chiang is extremely angered by the recent unwarranted surge in rice prices in this city and has issued handwritten instructions to relevant parties in this city to thoroughly investigate the underlying causes of the price increases. He is paying particular attention to artificial manipulation and hoarding. If any illegal elements are found to be using their special positions and relationships to manipulate prices, they will be executed upon verification of the facts. It is heard that the relevant parties have been making intensive inquiries and investigations in recent days, aiming to eradicate artificial manipulation and hoarding. It is expected that an announcement will soon be made to the four million residents of this city, to the delight of the people.

According to the Grain Administration, the processing and accounts of the 16 rice dealers who received grain loans are currently being reviewed by the Grain Loan Review Committee.

### Mayor Wu Reiterates Determination: Stabilize Rice Prices, Eliminate Labor Disputes. All Measures Will Absolutely Respect Public Opinion, Overcome All Difficulties, and Strive for the Welfare of Citizens.

[Reported by this newspaper] Mayor Wu Guozhen hosted a luncheon yesterday at the New Life Club for the heads of various newspapers in this city. During the luncheon, Wu stated: "I have been appointed to Shanghai, and all municipal measures will be based on public opinion. However, the elected City Council has not yet been established. To understand the opinions of citizens, I hope that the press will reflect genuine public opinion. The media is the most adequate measure of all administrative measures of the municipal government. My actions are based on benefiting all citizens of the city, and I will not be deterred by any obstacles. To implement my ideas, I am willing to sacrifice my reputation and position." He then invited those present to express their opinions. Hu Pu'an, Cheng Cangbo, Wang Yunsheng, Pan Gongzhan, and others spoke successively, offering many suggestions on municipal matters. Wu expressed his acceptance of all points raised and explained two points: (1) Regarding the issue of sanitation worker strikes, it has now been completely resolved unconditionally. The city government has agreed to make reasonable adjustments to their future living conditions. The garbage that has not yet been cleared from the city due to long-term accumulation and insufficient transportation is currently being handled with the assistance of road repair vehicles borrowed from the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. It is expected that it can be completely cleared within the next two days. (2) Regarding the new police measures, there are many rumors circulating. In fact, the police district system is the District System that has been implemented in England and the United States for a long time. After its implementation in the future, it should not lead to the various malpractices speculated by the outside world. In addition, Wu expressed his personal views, believing that the most important tasks at present are (1) suppressing prices, and to suppress prices, rice prices must first be suppressed. After days of running around and contacting people, the rice price issue has generally been stabilized and there should be no problems in the future. (2) The labor dispute issue. Currently, the wages in this city have already exceeded the US wage standards. For example, the pre-war production cost of cotton yarn was only 3 US cents, but now it has exceeded 45 US cents, while the current cost in the United States is only 16 US cents. I certainly do not want to lower wages, but wise workers should also know that if you want to eat chicken eggs, you cannot kill the hen first. If workers make unreasonable demands for higher wages again in the future, the production industry in Shanghai is likely to face a complete standstill in five or six months, which is what I am most worried about. Finally, Wu expressed his hope that receptions like today's could be held from time to time so that the opinions of citizens could be conveyed through the press, and the municipal government would have a basis to rely on.

Hu Pu'an: Stated that the biggest problems in Shanghai at present are food and housing. Constantly rising rice prices prevent people from living in peace, and rapid measures should be taken to suppress them. Those who originally lived in Shanghai do not feel difficulties in housing, but those who came to Shanghai from the rear after the victory find it difficult to find a house, which is a very serious problem. It is hoped that it can be resolved quickly.

Cheng Cangbo: Stated that the most urgent problem to be solved is the food problem. The measures taken by Mayor Wu to stabilize food prices after his arrival in office have been warmly supported by the citizens. However, the grain merchants who hoard and manipulate the market are still secretly active. It is hoped that the mayor will use resolute means to severely punish them to achieve the effect of "punishing one to warn a hundred." Secondly, health problems, traffic problems, and security problems should be closely monitored and efforts should be made to improve them. Regarding the security problem, most people only pay attention to preventing bandits and robberies, but they do not know that this is only "narrow security," and "broad security" should be given special attention. Since the victory, there have been many special classes who rely on their positions and power to engage in various illegal activities, bullying and extorting the people. This bad atmosphere must be completely eradicated. With Mayor Wu's position and prestige, it is believed that he will be able to overcome environmental obstacles and relieve the suffering of the people.

Wang Yunsheng: (1) Democratic politics originated in Greece. Greek democratic politics were actually city government politics, that is, the city government and the people were integrated. In the current era of democracy, all officials of the new people should help people live and solve various problems in life, and should no longer seek to manage the people. During the War of Resistance, the government used the four words "manage," "educate," "raise," and "protect" as the goals of local politics. This slogan should be revised now, because politics and education must be separated. The government has no right to educate the people, nor the power to raise the people. Protecting the people and enabling them to live and work in peace is the most important task. But to achieve the goal of enabling people to live and work in peace, we must eliminate the violent and appease the good. If a small number of violent elements cannot be removed, social order cannot be maintained, and good people cannot live and work in peace. Today, the government must show determination and courage to eliminate the violent and appease the good, and cannot continue to procrastinate. Take the labor disputes as an example. The recent labor disputes in Shanghai have changed from economic to political. There are many people who are secretly inciting and manipulating labor disputes. For example, the rickshaw pullers' strike was not unanimous, but some people deliberately punctured rickshaw tires to prevent the pullers from pulling their rickshaws. These troublemakers are not rickshaw pullers. They are actually sent by a certain party in northern Jiangsu. In addition to engaging in destructive work, they also use the banknotes squeezed in the "liberated areas" to buy goods and raise prices. I have seen slogans posted by striking workers in a certain industry saying, "It is better to starve to death than to break the law." May I ask: since someone publicly incites "breaking the law," and the government does not investigate and punish it severely, how can social order be maintained and how can people live in peace? I have always advocated "using severe penalties to govern troubled times." Only by eliminating the violent can we appease the good. Secondly, I strongly agree with Mr. Yunsheng's opinion that things that do not need to be done should not be done as much as possible. For all reform measures, the public opinion should be heeded before they are implemented.

### Central Bank Heist Takes Unexpected Turn: Chongqing Bank Allegedly Destroys Evidence by Altering Seized Ledgers. Manager Zhu Zhifei Unable to be Summoned for Questioning.

[Reported by this newspaper] Chen Yuancheng, the Ningbo native who is the main suspect in the Central Bank heist, is currently being pursued by the police. However, it has been found that Chen had pawned gold bars at the Chongqing Bank for 63 million yuan, stating that the term was ten days. However, he did not redeem them by the deadline, so the bank sold the gold bars. After the Huangpu Branch retrieved the original stolen goods, it sent personnel to the Shanghai branch of the Chongqing Bank to retrieve a ledger book for collateral loans for inspection. Who knew that Zhu Zhifei, the manager of the Chongqing Bank, would go to the Huangpu Branch with a friend at 9 pm the night before, requesting Zhou Guanghui, the section chief, to let him see the ledger. Yao Hongzhang, a patrol officer, gave him the ledger for inspection, but Zhu suddenly took the opportunity to alter seven entries in the ledger that recorded illegal loans using gold and other items, attempting to destroy evidence to avoid being penalized by the Financial Inspection Office of the Central Bank. His whereabouts are currently unknown. After the Huangpu Branch discovered Zhu's illegal behavior, it immediately issued a summons. The bank claimed that Zhu had left Shanghai, so Wu Zhigang, the assistant manager of the bank, turned himself in to explain. This unexpected problem in the major theft case is currently being investigated by the police.

### Minister Gu to Come to Shanghai Today to Address Labor Leaders Regarding Handling of Labor Disputes.

### Cargo Ships Unable to Enter the Port, US Military Ships to be Moved to Qingdao.

[Reported by this newspaper] It is learned that the US Navy authorities in this city are currently considering gradually moving a large number of US Navy ships stationed in this city to Qingdao to improve congestion in the port. Qingdao port is suitable for the development of naval operations, while the port of this city cannot accommodate large ships. Foreign shipping companies in this city believe that the congestion of ships in the port prevents foreign ships from berthing. For example, the American President Lines has as many as eight ships stranded outside the port waiting to berth. Therefore, the inflow of foreign goods is obstructed. In addition, US Navy ships occupy a large number of docks. Currently, from the 30th pier to the Bund, the cost of transporting goods in this section is US$3.5 per ton, and the cost of transporting goods in the section below the 30th pier is as high as US$5.25 per ton. Therefore, after the US Navy ships are moved, a large number of docks will be vacated for use, and the cost of transporting various goods can be expected to decrease.

### Labor Disputes Surging

[Reported by this newspaper] The entire group of pig slaughtering workers at the No. 1 Slaughterhouse on Shajing Road in this city clashed with the employers the night before due to opposition to the employers' exploitation and breach of contract.

The labor-management dispute in the Western clothing industry is being mediated by Mr. Zhu Xuefan. Negotiations continued yesterday, but no results were achieved, so the negotiations have stalled. The matter will be arbitrated by the Arbitration Committee.

The oil paint workers in the city demanded that their pay be increased from 6,000 yuan per day to 12,000 yuan, but no results were achieved, so they began a slowdown a few days ago. Yesterday, they also went to the Bureau of Social Affairs to petition for mediation.

The employees of the China Aviation Company's Huaji Airport requested adjustment of their benefits. After several negotiations, no results were achieved. The company side especially proposed temporarily borrowing 200,000 yuan per person, which would be discussed again after resuming work. The labor side believes that this method is far from the actual requirements, and has not accepted it, so there is still no hope of resuming work.

The employees of the dyeing and handkerchief industries went on strike to demand improved benefits from the employers. They once again appealed to the Bureau of Social Affairs for mediation at about 10 am yesterday. After negotiations between the two parties, the opinions differed only slightly. However, the employers' intention to prolong the labor dispute has caused deep dissatisfaction among the authorities.

### This Month's Cost of Living Index Will Exceed Last Month's by a Significant Amount

The Municipal Government compiles a cost of living index every month. Because the general salaried class believes that the commodity prices in this city in April were higher than in March, but the result was that at the end of last month, the Municipal Government announced that the commodity price index in April was lower than in March, employees were all suspicious. According to the Datong News Agency reporter, the Municipal Government calculates the commodity price index, as usual, on the last Wednesday of each month before the end of the month as the deadline for calculation. It is heard that the reason why the commodity price index for last month was lower than in March was that the sharp rise in commodity prices occurred after the last Wednesday before the end of April, which was included in the calculation for this month. It is heard that this month's cost of living index is much higher than last month's.

### Trial of Wang Jingwei's Private Secretary: Did Tang Liangli Have a Soul? Who Could Believe It? Debate Concluded on Liu Ruxiang and Four Other Cases; Liu Xingchen's Case to Be Sentenced This Afternoon

[Report from Our Newspaper] At 10:00 AM yesterday, Judge Qiu of the Special Criminal Tribunal of the High Court initially questioned Tang Liangli, the private secretary of the traitor Wang Jingwei. The defendant was represented by lawyers Chen Tingrui and Xu Yin. Tang, a native of Yunxiao, Fujian, was 46 years old. He had a prominent Japanese-style mustache, wore tortoise-shell glasses, and was dressed in a gray suit with yellow leather shoes, appearing quite aged. Tang was born in Java, once held Dutch citizenship, and studied in England. He spoke fluent English but was not proficient in Chinese. Therefore, lawyer Chen Tingrui served as the interpreter during the interrogation. In April of the 29th year of the Republic (1940), Tang served as the Director of the International Propaganda Bureau of the Propaganda Department, authored pro-Japanese propaganda books, which Wang Jingwei titled "It is Natural for China and Japan to be Friends, Unnatural to be Enemies," and published by the China United Society. The content distorted Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People, taking phrases out of context and doing his utmost to ingratiate himself with the enemy. In May of the 30th year of the Republic (1941), he concurrently served as the Vice Minister of the Puppet Foreign Ministry; in September of the same year, he concurrently served as the Vice Minister of the Puppet Propaganda Department; in September of the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), he was transferred to serve as the Director of the Puppet Institute of International Problems, until the victory of the war. He was arrested by the Military Intelligence Bureau and handed over to the High Procuratorate for investigation and prosecution. According to Tang's statement, he had opposed imperialism since childhood. When he was in Java, he fled to England due to Dutch oppression. From the age of fifteen, he joined the Anti-Japanese Alliance, using writing as a weapon to resist Japanese imperialism. In 1930, he returned to China to engage in practical anti-Japanese propaganda work. Because he was unwilling to be protected by foreign consular jurisdiction, he returned his Dutch citizenship certificate and resumed his Chinese nationality. His anti-Japanese English books, such as "Manchukuo: Puppet State," "China's Reconstruction," "China's Railways," "China's Resistance to Japanese Aggression," "China's New Currency System," and the "People's Forum" he edited, were all popular among anti-Japanese patriots. In 1939, he was arrested by the Japanese. Although he was released soon after, his actions were monitored. Because of his writing skills and reputation, he was forced to take up puppet positions, but they were all nominal, and he did not do any actual work. He insisted, "Although my body was conquered by them, my heart and soul still belonged to the motherland." During his tenure as the Director of the Puppet Institute of International Problems, he was dismissed due to poor performance, which displeased the Japanese. He strongly stated that he had not engaged in any actions that were against his country or benefited the enemy. Judge Qiu stated that the case still required detailed investigation and adjourned the hearing. After the court session, the defendant met with his family to inquire about their well-being and was then taken back to prison.

### A Portion of U.S. Surplus Materials Arrives in Shanghai; Jiang Shaojin Goes to Nanjing to Request Instructions on Distribution Methods

### Incident Coincidence Causes Citizens to Suspect the Strange; Fire Broke Out Near the Snake Killed in Nanshi

### British University Students Willing to Undergo Medical Experiments: Implementation to Begin in July This Year

[Dispatch from the British Information Service, London, 28th] The British Medical Research Council and the Ministry of Health are jointly planning to establish an influenza research institute. Influenza is a particularly complex disease, and it has not yet been possible to use animals for experimental research. However, when the institute begins its work in July, it will select students from British universities who volunteer to undergo experiments for ten to fourteen days. The students will be isolated from the outside world and from each other. The purpose of this work is to seek the nature of the source of influenza. If a conclusion can be reached within two years, it can be regarded as a significant achievement.

### Initiator of Breaking Traditional Education: The Yucai School in Beibei; American "One Week" Magazine Publishes News in a Prominent Position

[Dispatch from the American News Service, San Francisco, May 27th] The American magazine "One Week" published on the 19th, in a prominent position, information about the "Yucai School" located fifty miles north of Chongqing in Beibei, which is specifically for gifted children. The founder of the school is Dr. Tao Xingzhi. Tao graduated from the University of Illinois in the United States and was a student of the famous educator John Dewey at Columbia University.

Motivation for Founding

According to the magazine, in 1938, Tao encountered a ragged child wandering on the streets of Hankou while he was instructing some young children squatting by the roadside to sing. Tao immediately took the child to a music teacher for training. Within three days, the child was able to write out the melody in musical notation after listening to songs he was unfamiliar with. This experience inspired Dr. Tao to establish a school. He gathered a small number of teachers who were willing to engage in this work, which was almost entirely of a voluntary nature. They visited and tested thousands of children in fifteen provinces of China, searching for children with particularly outstanding talents. These children are expected to become leaders in China's future art and academic circles. The Yucai School was established with a core of writers, artists, musicians, and scientists.

Source of Donations

Later, Tao requested assistance from the United States. All donations from Americans were turned over to the United China Relief Association in New York for transfer. It is said that the largest source of donations is from American school children. The school currently has 400 students, ranging in age from six to twenty. These children are selected from rural areas in war zones or from impoverished families. After testing, if they demonstrate special talents, they can receive training to become young artists, musicians, writers, scientists, and workers in society. However, their education does not stop there. Every student believes that it is their responsibility to pass on what they have learned to others.

Teaching Farmers and Workers

Therefore, these students must spend at least one hour each day teaching approximately two thousand farmers, miners, and their families to read and write, and imparting knowledge of hygiene, handicrafts, and democratic principles. Children attend classes for 36 to 40 hours per week. They also learn first aid, cooking, sewing, driving, and swimming. However, they seem most interested in music, drama, painting, dance, literature, natural sciences, and social sciences. To break with China's traditional concepts, all staff and students at the school personally engage in various manual tasks, in order to develop self-reliance. They even wash their own clothes, make their own utensils, and cultivate part of the school's farm.

### Respect Teachers Movement: Student Fundraising Concluded Successfully; Charity Sale of Calligraphy and Paintings to Be Raffled Today

[Report from Our Newspaper] The student fundraising for the Respect Teachers Movement in this city was successfully concluded yesterday afternoon. The collected donations will be sent to the designated bank today. The bank receipt should be used to complete the process with the association. All used donation books, member badges, liaison badges, and remaining red and blue thank you stickers must be returned.

Student Fundraising Situation

The donation situation in various shops exceeded expectations. For example, Da Butong Shoe Store had more than sixty red and blue donation thank you stickers on its shop window. ABC Raincoat Factory had even more, with more than one hundred and ninety stickers. Hongxiang Fashion Company had all three shop windows covered, too many to count. Other examples include Hongbao Fresh Bridge Factory, which provided over a thousand dozen bottles of soda, sauce water, and fresh orange water in two days. Zhonghua Manufacturing Factory, Ai Ai Pharmacy, Wuzhou Pharmacy, Wanguo Pharmacy, Aimei Pharmacy, Zhongying Pharmacy, and Municipal North Middle School donated thousands of packages of various emergency medicines such as Rendan, Nidan, Bagua Dan, Shajiang Water, and Wan Jin. Yesterday's fundraising targets, in addition to businesses, also included factories and offices, with good results. It is reported that each group from Tongde Medical College raised over 300,000 yuan, with the highest group raising 490,000 yuan. The distribution of this donation will be decided jointly by school principals, representatives from industry and commerce, representatives from the association, and student representatives. (Ren)

Charity Sale of Calligraphy and Paintings Situation

[Another Report] The charity exhibition of calligraphy and paintings held at the French Elementary School on Huanlu Road has seen a continuous stream of visitors since its opening on the 25th. Most of the calligraphy and painting tickets, priced at 20,000 yuan each, have been sold. It is scheduled to hold a public lottery at the venue today and tomorrow (the 29th and 30th) to draw the numbers for claiming the items. To prevent overcrowding, the association has dispatched additional staff to the venue to assist. Those who hold calligraphy and painting tickets are requested to bring their tickets to the venue for the lottery on these two days, from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM each day. In addition, auctions of masterpieces have been held continuously in recent days. Enthusiastic individuals can go to bid, with the highest bidder winning. Mr. Xiao Guang of the association generously donated 100 mu of fertile land in Dinghai County, Pujiang, which is also being auctioned publicly at the venue, with a starting price of 40,000 yuan per mu. Those who wish to purchase can go to bid, fulfilling the meaning of respecting teachers while also obtaining good land, a win-win situation, an opportunity not to be missed. (Ren)

### Ten Organizations in This City Commemorate Jia Jiying: Held at the Pudong Native Place Association This Year

### Kunyu Expedition Basketball Team: Victorious in First Match Against Shantou Team; Chiang Wei-kuo Attends and Performs Tip-Off; Match Result 39 to 26

The Kunyu Expedition Basketball Team's first match in Shanghai was against the Shantou Team at the Municipal Gymnasium last night at 7:45 PM. The audience who came for the reputation was no less than a thousand people. Major Chiang Wei-kuo and his wife arrived at the gymnasium at 7:30 PM and were accompanied into the venue by Lin Xucang, Chairman of the Basketball Committee. The audience responded with enthusiastic applause, and the atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic. As a result, the Kunyu team won its first match, 39 to 26. The score at halftime was 20 to 15.

After the photography session, Mr. Chiang Wei-kuo performed the tip-off ceremony, and both sides began to engage. Kunyu fielded Shi Kun, Da Yun, Yunming, Yanxiong, and Xiangcheng. Cai Yanxiong first broke the blue circle, and Lin Weicong immediately returned the color. Liang Yunming broke in and scored, and Tang Kun's long-range shot was successful. The Shantou team took the opportunity to attack, and He Lide and Zhen Qingjiang repeatedly gained points. Kunyu then recalled Yanxiong and replaced Yunming. When He Lide scored a bullseye, the first half ended with 20 to 15, with the visiting team taking the lead.

After the break, the two sides returned to the field. Liang Yunming scored, and the Shantou team's Zhen Qingjiang returned the favor. The Shantou team called a timeout, and Yunming scored again. Chen Qingjiang and He Lide's close-range and long-range shots were all successful, chasing closely for a while. The score difference between the guest and host teams was only two points, and the situation was tense. Kunyu was unwilling to show weakness. Da Yun held up a person under the basket, and Shi Kun was awarded a free throw. The visitor's momentum was revived. Eight minutes before the end of the game, Ma was injured and Zhou Bin replaced him. The Shantou team lost its main player, and Kunyu took the opportunity to attack fiercely. Shi Kun scored four points in a row, and Da Yun also added to the score, making it 37 to 24. Before long, Da Yun and Yanxiong were both disqualified for five fouls, and Pan Guobao and Liang Yunming were added to the team. Time was running out, but the overall situation was not affected. The silver whistle sounded, 39 to 26, and the Kunyu Expeditionary Force won its first match.

Tomorrow's Match Against the US Navy Enchuton Team

The Kunyu Expedition Basketball Team has four matches scheduled in Shanghai. The second match is tomorrow (Thursday) against the US Navy Enchuton. The third match is on June 3 (Monday) against the Hualian Team. The US Navy Enchuton has just arrived in Shanghai, and its strength is above that of the 3198 Signal Team, so it is expected that tomorrow's match with the Expeditionary Force will be a splendid performance.

### An Ideal Elementary School Curriculum Should Focus on Activities in Four Areas: Intellectual, Moral, Physical, and Aesthetic

To the Editor:

The revision meeting for the elementary school curriculum standards has officially begun, and we who serve in the field of elementary school education feel very excited! Especially today after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, this education meeting, which is related to our country's basic construction, makes us have very deep and warm expectations. However, the facts tell us that the convening of the meeting was not as grand as we imagined. The so-called "experts" who participated in the revision were not selected based on the principle of universal recruitment from across the country, nor were they based on the conditions of recruiting super-talented people. They casually invited a few nearby people and hurriedly started the meeting. How can there be any results from such perfunctory actions?

Originally, the Ministry of Education had six principles for this curriculum revision: (1) The courses of each subject are too complex and should be simplified, concise, and interesting. (2) The scope of teaching materials should be adapted to the physical and mental development of children, making it easy for children to understand. (3) The content of teaching materials should be universal, considering both urban and rural areas, and paying attention to timeliness and flexibility. (4) Compulsory education should take six years as the highest standard, and the curriculum must pay attention to the principle of continuity for six years, but can be divided into sections of four years. (5) In terms of training, emphasis should be placed on personal moral cultivation, legal concepts, democratic spirit, and the implementation of civil rights. (6) The curriculum standard is holistic, with equal emphasis on intellectual, moral, and physical education, and should not only focus on knowledge subjects. These six principles are quite concise and clear, but after the "experts" discussed them, they added the following two principles: "(1) The elementary school curriculum should focus on activities in five areas: civics, recreation, science, society, and language. (2) The elementary school curriculum is the minimum change in personality and behavior that is hoped to be achieved within the elementary school stage." The first additional principle divides civics, recreation, science, society, and language into five areas of activity. In principle, it seems a bit redundant and somewhat flawed. The most incomprehensible thing is to divide "science" and "society" into two separate areas. In fact, society is part of science. "Society" and "nature" in the elementary school curriculum are both "science." Now that "society" and "science" are independent, I don't know how to start when actually compiling the curriculum in the future?

As for the second added principle, it seems to focus solely on moral education. Is the elementary school curriculum just about hoping for the minimum change in personality and behavior within the elementary school stage? This is clearly illogical.

An ideal elementary school curriculum should focus on activities in four areas: intellectual, moral, physical, and aesthetic. Even if we lower our standards, we should follow the sixth principle originally set by the Ministry of Education, and only seek "equal emphasis on intellectual, moral, and physical education," which would still feel justifiable. These are my personal views, and I don't know if they are appropriate. I respectfully ask your newspaper to publish them, and I hope that the "experts" will provide more guidance. I would be very grateful!

### Gold Prices Continue to Weaken; US Dollar Still Exceptionally Popular

Spot gold, though initially stable in early morning trading yesterday, gradually declined from 1.8 million [currency unit] and beyond. Overnight fears caused a drop to below 1.76 million. Afterwards, it stabilized slightly. The US dollar was popular, with strong demand for arbitrage. It briefly rose to around 1.78 million after struggling for a long time. The Central Bank of China allocated 132 bars [of gold], slightly lowering the price to 1.775 million. The price remained hovering around this level for ten days. The US dollar side continued to arbitrage, and by noon, it rebounded to above 1.79 million. At noon, it hovered around 1.79 million, and the afternoon started stably. It finally closed around 1.78 million, a slight decrease of 5,000 [currency unit] compared to the previous close. Ornamental gold remained at 190,000 [currency unit]. Silver was stable. The buying and selling of silver dollars was prohibited. Although quoted prices were similar to the previous day, purchasing was difficult. The discount rate remained around 1.3%.

Foreign currency, particularly US dollars, was in high demand for foreign firms' settlement of accounts, leading to exceptional tightness. Opening at 2300 [currency unit] in the morning, demand exceeded supply, causing a gradual rise. The gold market was sluggish, with multiple fluctuations mid-session. However, as demand remained strong, a decline was difficult. It rose to 2360 [currency unit] before noon, then retreated slightly. In the afternoon, it followed the gold price's movements, starting stable and then flat. The final result was a slight increase of ten [currency unit] compared to the previous close. Hong Kong notes started flat and then stabilized, also gaining five [currency unit]. Hong Kong telegraphic transfers were 410-420 [currency unit], Robbie was 520 [currency unit], with some trading. US exchange rates were reported flat.

### Public Bonds: Bulls and Bears Battle, Leading to Initial Weakness Followed by Strength

In the public bond market, both bulls and bears displayed their skills, leading to rapid fluctuations. Series C bonds saw selling pressure from Northern traders. After a morning opening, prices weakened from 7450 [currency unit]. Bears took advantage of the situation, pushing the price below the 7,000 [currency unit] mark, reaching a low of 6,900 [currency unit]. Shanghai traders maintained support at lower levels, allowing the price to stabilize. A certain bank used small amounts of capital to absorb bonds at low prices. Encouraged by this, retail investors became active, pushing the price up to 7300 [currency unit] at noon, ending the day similar to the previous close. Series A, B, and E bonds were very active, while Series D bonds were extremely unpopular. Consequently, Series A and B bonds were only 100 [currency unit] lower, Series E bonds were 50 [currency unit] lower, while Series D bonds alone fell by 400 [currency unit].

### Yarn Market: Weak Sales; Reduced Cotton Trading

Yesterday's yarn market experienced mixed fortunes. 20-count yarn was extremely average, fluctuating around 5,000 [currency unit]. 16-count yarn, which had been dormant for a long time, suddenly shone, soaring by 40,000-50,000 [currency unit]. 42-count double-strand thread, due to textile mills only selling to appointed merchants, and large quantities not being allocated, led to hoarding by fellow traders. Blue Wind's price rose to 2,530,000-2,540,000 [currency unit], an increase of 50,000-60,000 [currency unit] compared to the previous day. Despite weak sales, sentiment remained relatively stable.

Yesterday's New York American cotton telegram reported a drop of 15 to 18 points. The near-term price was US$27.73, the long-term price was US$28.33, and the spot price for middling cotton was US$28.35. Local spot cotton trading was reduced. Due to the frequent weakening of silk and gold prices and the drop in American cotton prices, factories were mainly in a wait-and-see mode, with only some speculative activity by traders. Market prices were generally similar.

### Textile Mill Supply Insufficient; Cloth Market Initially Weak, Then Rises

The market was initially weak but then rose yesterday. In the morning, due to the period for opening sales of cloth from the Central Textile Mill, many traders sold to cash in their funds, in order to make further purchases from the Central Textile Mill. At the same time, buyers adopted a wait-and-see attitude, causing market weakness. The market price fell by 1,000 [currency unit]. At noon, the Central Textile Mill announced that 12-pound fine cloth was scarce and could not be supplied. Only 12-pound unbranded colored balls cloth, and An An blue cloth from number 775 to the last number, and from number 1 to 129, were allocated. All other numbers were completely unallocated. The allocation of Guanyin bleached cloth was also insufficient. As a result, the market rallied in the afternoon, rising by 1,000-2,000 [currency unit].

### Taiwan Sugar Corporation: Second Sale of Medium Sugar

The Taiwan Sugar Corporation will hold its second sale of medium granulated sugar today.

Subsequently, the Shanghai Money Exchange Association submitted a document to the Ministry of Finance and the Bank, stating that many members had misunderstood the regulations and failed to register in time, requesting a supplementary application process. The Bank authorities, in consideration of the merchants' difficulties, granted a grace period for processing. Another 111 institutions have now been approved, with money exchange shops accounting for the vast majority. The list is as follows: Dali, Dakang, Datong H记, Dakang Xinji, Dafayongji, Dakang Changji, Santai, Yuanyi, Yuanlong Heji, Yuanda, Yuansheng, Yuanshun, Gonghe, Tiantai, Zhenghua, Bingji, Zhengtai, Zhengfeng, Hengxiangji, Licheng, Yongfa, Yongda Xiangji, Tongchang, Tongsheng, Tongli Yongji, Hongyuan Xinji, Lishen, Hexing, Asia, XieKang, Shengchang, Mao Tai Changji, Xinyu Heji, Xincheng Chang, Mao Kang, Hengtai, Hengtai Xinji, Hengtai, Yulong, Xiangmao, Xiangyuan, Tongyi, Houchang, Houji, Tailai, Shenchang, Yifeng, Jin Tai Xieji, Jingcheng, Qiankang, Huashi, Shunli, Shunda, Fuxing 记, Fuyuan, Fuda, Wei Yuan, Zhongfu, Fukang, Wanli, Yongji, Huikang, Yuanchang Xinji, Yuantaihe, Yuanfeng, Xinfeng, Fuhe, Fucheng, Fukang Qingji, Fussen Songji, Fudashi Ji, Dingda, Huitong, Dexiang, Detai, Dechang, Guangli, Guangyu, Runde, Run Tai Yuanji, Xinghe Ruiji, Xinghua, 章记, Hongda Xinji, Hongyu Zhenji, Hongyu, Hongchang Yunji, 泰, Lianfeng, Baohua, Baoyuan Chang Bingji, Baoshen Fuji, Baoxiang Ningji, Baokang Zhiji, Shilong, Baochang, Yongtai, Taixing, Wanchang, Tongfeng, Heng Xieji, Fuda Zengji, Youli, Han Yong, Chengda, Wanxiang, Senyuan, Dahua, Tongtai Renji, Yixing Xingji, Yifeng, Shanghai Silk Industry Bank, Yongcheng Bank, Qiantai Commercial Bank, Zhongyi Trust Company. Each company has received a license from the bank. From today onwards, they will operate the business of buying and selling foreign currency banknotes in accordance with the provisions of the "Provisional Measures for the Administration of Foreign Exchange." All banks and shops that have not obtained a license will not be allowed to apply again in the future and should automatically cease operating the business of buying and selling foreign currency banknotes from today onwards. The bank authorities also stated that the number of money exchange shops in the city is already large, and new establishments will not be allowed to operate the business of buying and selling foreign currency banknotes in the future.

### White Coal Declines Again; Coal Briquette Sales are Sluggish

The coal market is quiet. Sales of white coal chunks are sluggish and continue to decline slightly. Sales of white coal dust are also very weak due to the sluggish sales of coal briquettes in various stores. The main reason for the sluggish sales of coal briquettes is the abundance of liquid fuels on the market, with many small household users switching to kerosene. It is reported that coal briquette manufacturers will soon submit a request to the Shanghai Regional Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, requesting a reduction in the allocation price of Hongji coal dust, the raw material for making briquettes, in order to compete.

### Current Cocoon Price Problem: Increased Costs Lead to Losses for Silk Farmers; Wuxi County Still Needs to Levy a Special Tax

(Wuxi News) The silk cocoon harvest in the Wuxi area, the center of Jiangnan silk production, was quite poor this spring. At the beginning of the silkworm rearing season this spring, there was a shortage of silkworm eggs, leading to a rise in egg prices. Mulberry leaf prices also jumped, directly increasing the cost of silkworm rearing and indirectly affecting the health of the silkworms. Because silk farmers believed that mulberry prices were too high, they did not distinguish between good and bad leaves and used them all to feed the silkworms. As the fresh cocoons came on the market, the cocoon prices did not cover the costs. It is estimated that each load of fresh cocoons sold results in a loss of over 50,000 [currency unit].

The Wuxi County Government, due to its huge expenditures and insufficient income, decided to levy a special tax on fresh cocoons. It is learned that the Wuxi silk cocoon industry, seeing no profit, cannot bear the additional tax. They jointly submitted a request to the County Government and the Provincial Government for an exemption. The reasons given by the silk cocoon industry are as follows: (1) Silk is one of China's main export products, and the government has already exempted export taxes. (2) The silk cocoon industry is currently experiencing significant losses and is adopting a wait-and-see attitude. Adding to the burden will make the future of the silk industry even more uncertain. (3) This special tax will directly affect planting grounds, silkworm farmers, cocoon merchants, and silk factories. If it is not exempted, it will lead to complete ruin.

### Zhejiang Provincial Authorities Advise Increasing Cocoon Prices to 150,000 [Currency Unit] Per Load

(Central News Agency, this city) The price of fresh cocoons this year, based on the silk price, is 100,000 [currency unit] per market load, assuming 400 catties of silk, which silk merchants cannot bear. After the announcement by the Zhejiang Provincial Government, silkworm farmers complained that leaf prices were too high and did not cover costs. They repeatedly requested an increase. Subsequently, Zhejiang Governor Shen invited Party Committee Director Luo, Silk Association Chairman Chen, and General Manager Ge of the China Silk Company to discuss the matter. They all agreed to advise the silk factories to increase the purchase price in order to barely maintain the costs for silkworm farmers. Fortunately, the factories were able to heed the advice of the provincial Party and government authorities and increase the price of high-quality fresh cocoons to 150,000 [currency unit] per market load, depending on the quality. It is believed that the cocoons grown from the silkworm eggs purchased from Japan by the China Silk Company this year are of extremely high quality, much higher than the local varieties. After the cocoon price increase, although factories have 　　, the higher cost is not significant compared to the lower quality cocoons. As for increasing the overall purchase price by factories and raising costs, it is hoped that the government will take measures to provide subsidies.

### Weather Turns Hot, Holders Seek to Sell; Rice Prices See a Small Rebound Yesterday; Coarse Grains and Oil Cakes Also Decline

Yesterday, the weather suddenly turned hot, and the rice market became an image of supply exceeding demand as holders sought to sell. Medium and lower grades of japonica and indica rice fell by nearly 1,000 [currency unit]. White Yuan rice also showed signs of softening. Flat-price flour has begun to be sold, and shop sales are bound to decrease, with reduced consumption. Market prices fell by 200-300 [currency unit], with few transactions. Soybeans also fell by 1,000 [currency unit], with minimal trading. Bran demand was weak, and prices fell by 100 [currency unit]. Oil cakes also declined along with other items, rebounding by 200-300 [currency unit]. Wheat was weak and lacked trading, with no buyers. The new wheat harvest is approaching. Red sorghum had few buyers, sesame was stagnant, and raw peanuts also became sluggish, falling by 1,000-2,000 [currency unit]. Corn had few customers and fell sharply by 2,000-3,000 [currency unit]. The oil market declined steadily due to the continuous arrival of goods from various routes. Raw oil, soybean oil, rapeseed oil, and clear oil all fell by around 2,000 [currency unit]. Yesterday, the amount of rice arriving in the city was approximately 7,000 shi, according to rice market information.

### Soviet Union to Cultivate Rice in the Far East

[Reuters, Moscow, 28th] According to news from Vladivostok, the Soviet Union will cultivate the most important rice-producing farm in the Soviet Union in its Far East coastal region. The soil here is fertile and the climate is suitable for farming.

### Tea Market: Uneven Strength

Recently, although the demand for Chinese tea in the foreign tea market, such as South America, is strong, the prices offered are extremely tight. Due to cost considerations, tea merchants in the city find it difficult to sell at low prices, resulting in sluggish exports. Recently, Jardine Matheson only loaded about 200 boxes of Haikou black tea, with prices at 40,000 [currency unit] per load. As for Tregon silk tea, which is exclusively sold to Mumbai, India, White-headed traders like Ruichang and 拈孖治 and other foreign firms continued to show interest, but holders are unwilling to sell without getting a good price, so transactions are difficult to finalize. However, the trend remains positive. Domestic sales of tea have both imports and exports, and the situation is not quiet, but market prices are uneven. Qimen tea has less demand than supply, and prices have fallen. New Longjing tea has many sources from various production areas, but the quality is poor, so prices continue to be lower. Other varieties remain stable.

### Egg Industry to Hold Market Discussions Twice Weekly

Egg industry companies and shops in the city are holding discussions because the prices of miscellaneous grains have soared recently, and the cost of chicken and duck eggs in the producing areas is very high. In addition, water transport costs are enormous. It is impossible to maintain business without a unified adjustment of market prices. A meeting was held at the association on Sunday afternoon at 3:00 PM. More than 30 companies attended. It was resolved that chicken and duck egg market prices will be determined by the association at meetings held every Wednesday and Saturday. The prices decided at this meeting are as follows: large colored eggs 1,800,000 [currency unit] per thousand, medium 1,600,000 [currency unit], large 　 eggs 1,700,000 [currency unit] per thousand, medium 1,500,000 [currency unit], small 1,400,000 [currency unit], salted eggs 1,600,000 [currency unit], large fresh chicken eggs 1,350,000 [currency unit] per thousand, medium 1,150,000 [currency unit], small 1,000,000 [currency unit], chicken eggs 85,000 [currency unit] per 100 catties for large red shells, and 80,000 [currency unit] for white shells.

### Sugar Prices Slightly Decrease

Yesterday, the sugar market trend was slightly soft. The association marked the price of medium granulated sugar for dock delivery at 73,500 [currency unit], later at 73,000 to 72,500 [currency unit]. New Company warehouse receipts were 70,000 [currency unit], spot goods were 74,000 [currency unit], later 73,000 to 72,000 [currency unit], and finally 72,500 [currency unit], a decrease of over 1,000 [currency unit]. Raw sugar was 61,000 [currency unit], and three-and-a-half white sugar was 78,000 to 80,000 [currency unit]. Some shipments of miscellaneous road green goods opened at 41,000 [currency unit].

### Jinshan Branches See New High Prices

Jinshan branches are nearly　　due to a lack of arrivals and inventory. Recently, dozens of pieces of Jinshan flat branches arrived. Yesterday, they opened at 335,000 [currency unit], a new high price since the victory.

### Chile's Rice Production This Year is Particularly Abundant, Eight Times More Than Pre-War Production

[Reuters, Santiago, 28th] Chile's 1945-46 rice harvest totaled 8,252,000 bushels (240 million pounds after milling), about 1 million bushels more than the last estimated figure of 7,286,000 bushels a year earlier. It is eight times more than pre-war production. This year's harvest is the fifth year of exceptionally high production. According to recent estimates, the rice-producing area in 1945-46 totaled 118,000 acres. The average yield this season is 70 bushels per acre. Rice exports in 1944-45 totaled about 100 million pounds.

### More American and Indian Cotton Arrive

(This newspaper's report) The Qiangna Naiweige Tuoer (transliteration) ship, acting as agent for Shilong Foreign Company, arrived in Shanghai from Seattle, carrying 4,170 bales of cotton. It arrived yesterday afternoon and berthed at the Yitaixing Wharf in Pudong to unload. The Qiaosidiningmansike ship, managed by Rong 　 Company, transported 3,000 tons of Indian cotton from Mumbai to Shanghai. It was expected to enter port at 8:00 PM yesterday and berth at the Qichang Wharf in Pudong to unload.

### Indian Tea Exports Increase by 23 Million Pounds

### Yongsha's One-for-Nine Stock Split Decided; Popular Stocks Become More Vigorous; Small and Medium-Sized Stocks Decline More Than Rise

Although retail investors in Chinese stocks were excited, they were no match for large investors selling at high prices, repeating the old pattern of the previous day, with initial strength followed by weakness. At the peak, Yongsha reached a new high of around 6,450 [currency unit], and Meiya reached 5,900 [currency unit]. Small stocks were extremely inferior and failed to surpass the high prices of the previous day. Apart from Xinguang, which attracted attention, and following Jingfu, saw a squeeze. The result was that most stocks saw lower prices near noon. Prices rose slightly after the noon close. Jingfu and Qinxing fell slightly. Among the less popular small and medium-sized stocks, declines outnumbered gains. Yongsha's capital adjustment decided on a one-for-nine stock split. After a dividend of three [currency unit], the psychological effect on speculative funds made them more excited about popular stocks. Without significant selling pressure, the trend is likely to rise rather than fall. The veteran stocks have a slightly more stable foothold, with buyers at low levels, and trading has increased slightly. Foreign stock trading was sluggish, with demand mostly scattered. There was still selling of large inventories. Yisha retreated from an opening of 12,700 [currency unit] to 11,700 [currency unit]. Industry players took advantage of the low price to absorb, providing support. After the weakness, it stabilized slightly. The final result compared to the previous close, apart from steel, which rose slightly, and industry advertisements, which were flat, the rest continued to decline slightly.

### American Soybeans: 7,000 Tons Imported Yesterday

[This Newspaper's Report] The Percy E. Foxworth, a ship of the American President Lines, arrived yesterday noon from the United States port city, carrying 7,000 tons of soybeans and 500 tons of used clothing. The exact number of textiles is unknown. It is said that all of them are for relief of Yi Tai. The ship berthed and started to unload at the docks. The Qiaosidiningmansike,經理 by Rong 　 Company, transported 3,000 tons of Indian cotton from Mumbai to Shanghai. It was expected to enter port at 8:00 PM yesterday and berth at the Qichang Wharf in Pudong to unload.

### Caustic Soda Continues to Rise

Imports of American caustic soda are scarce, and the actual sales of factories in the city are increasing daily. Local inventory is gradually thinning. Yesterday, it was reported by industry insiders that a certain foreign firm has not shipped goods for a long time, and the allocation price for subsequent batches will continue to rise. Vaseline, bleaching powder, and sulfuric acid have continued to arrive in Shanghai.

### Economic Briefs

In the past one or two months, ordinary citizens have switched to burning kerosene, and the sales of firewood and charcoal have sharply declined. It is reported that in the past week, the amount of firewood and charcoal transported to Shanghai from the Jinshan area has been considerable, and inventory is increasing daily.

The American-owned Shanghai Power Company resumed operations after the victory. Initially, due to high expenses, it suffered huge losses every month. Since this month, business has greatly improved. It is expected that there will be no losses at the end of this month.

The current Economic Affairs Ministry's special commissioner for Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, Zhang Zi　, had submitted his resignation, but Minister Wang in Shanghai has persuaded him to stay. The special commissioner's office has not yet completed its takeover tasks and needs to continue, and will not be abolished in the short term.

### 29 Days in Changchun (11)

—Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Shao Shenzhi

During our detention, the Communist Party's propaganda efforts unfolded. The Northeast Daily, the official newspaper of the CCP Northeast Bureau, moved from Jilin. The Changchun Daily was re-established. Even the Japanese newspaper, Democratic Daily (published by the Democratic Japan Society), was launched, with the headline article titled "Sino-Japanese Cooperation, Realizing Northeast Construction Through Democratic Struggle, Intending to　　". We also saw a mimeographed Japanese newspaper, claiming that an American journalist's small　plane had been stolen. This was a fabrication; we dare not say other news.

We could only conduct interviews inside the house, but we were tired of looking at all the sofas and chairs in the house. Everyone's faces were　hot. Li Lippman therefore suggested to 　　to borrow some machine guns from the Eighth Route Army for us to play with, to let us open fire and fight each other until we all fell to the ground, which could also save trouble in the future.

### Activities of the Japanese Communist Party

On the 24th, Zhou Baozhong dispatched guards to escort us out, which was the second "freedom" mentioned in the previous text. As we walked down the street, we saw hundreds, even thousands, of Japanese people leisurely strolling, seemingly more free than we were. At that time, we felt very uncomfortable, always sensing that in Changchun, there was another kind of people and another kind of power at work. This other kind of people and power, we can specifically report, is the Japanese Communist Party.

On the evening of the 25th, when Zhou Baozhong came to our reporters' residence for dinner, Shen Zhi was the first to ask him, "The Japanese Communist Party in Changchun is very active right now. We even saw leaflets they distributed to Japanese residents of Changchun on the 20th. I wonder what your opinion is on this matter?" Zhou immediately replied, "In our eyes, regardless of whether the Japanese are revolutionary or not, they are all the same. They are, after all, Japanese." He then asked, "What is the relationship between Gangye Susumu, the leader of the Japanese Communist Party in Yan'an, and the Northeast?" Zhou replied, "There is no relationship at all." It was indeed a fact that Gangye Susumu's leaflets to the Japanese residents in Changchun existed. Shi Xun asked him, "Then what is your view on the government's current work of repatriating Japanese residents?" Zhou replied, "As we see it, if they like to stay here, that's fine. Conversely, if they want to go back, we naturally don't object."

We did not personally witness Japanese people fighting in the Communist army, because we were confined to our rooms. Therefore, we cannot make reckless statements about the truth or falsehood of the facts to our readers. However, it is true that we personally saw Japanese people working together before driving vehicles and painting large slogans on walls. Shi Xun once asked Lü Zhengcao whether there were still Japanese people in the factory. Lü Zhengcao did not answer directly, but he said, "These are all members." He told us that there were still Japanese employees in the water and electricity plant and the tram company.

After the Communist army occupied Changchun, in the beginning, when everything was not yet in order, the Japanese Communist Party was not very active. Only Gangye Susumu's "Leaflet to the Japanese Residents" could be seen on the streets, pasted on walls or scattered on the ground. This leaflet was brought to us by our chief steward on the morning of the 24th, snatched from the street on his way back from buying groceries.

On the 26th, the activities of the Japanese Communist Party became more concrete. The so-called Preparatory Committee of the Japanese People's Democratic League in Changchun was established. On the 27th, a lengthy declaration was issued, along with a concrete program and regulations for current work facilities.

Regarding the program, the translation is as follows: (1) Unite the Japanese residents in the Northeast, assist in the construction of the Northeast, strive for peace in the Northeast, develop true democracy, and promote the construction of the motherland as soon as possible through the progressive democratic front of Japan. (2) This league will consult with the Democratic Autonomous Government of China to determine the stable life and social and political status of our Japanese compatriots in the Northeast. (3) Eliminate militarism in the country, eliminate reactionary elements in the country, and liquidate the selfish concept of imperialism. And thoroughly strengthen democratic activities.

Regarding the regulations for work facilities, there are three: (1) Build a peaceful and unified new Northeast. (2) Eliminate militarism and reactionary elements, and liquidate militarism. (3) Participate in technical cooperation in the construction of the new Northeast. (4) Establish the rights of Japanese residents to reside, movable property rights, business rights, and cultivation rights on the land of the new Northeast. (5) Establish universal democratic education. (6) Thoroughly provide relief to refugees. (7) Expedite the resolution of repatriation issues. (8) Strengthen the friendship between the Chinese people. (9) Promote democratic construction and a broad democratic front in Japan.

At the same time, on the 27th, the Preparatory Committee of the Japanese People's Democratic League in Changchun negotiated with the Changchun Municipal Government supported by the Chinese Communist Party and decided to shut down several Japanese newspapers that had been anti-democratic in Changchun. As far as we know, the newspapers that were shut down include the Changchun Japanese News, the Northeast Japan News, and the Japanese Residents Changchun News.

Therefore, the Democratic Japan Daily News, a half-sized newspaper supported and published by the Democratic Japan Society, emerged. Each copy costs two yuan, and the monthly subscription is forty-five yuan. This is currently the only Japanese newspaper in Changchun, so its circulation is quite wide.

The newspaper was launched on the 29th. The inaugural editorial was an article titled "Promoting China-Japan Cooperation and Realizing the Desire to Build the Northeast through Democratic Struggle." This article was mentioned in the previous section, and a brief translation of its main points is as follows:

"Today, the Northeast People's Autonomous Army has entered Changchun, and therefore the democratic activities of us Japanese people can also be fully free. We will cooperate with the most progressive leaders in China, and the establishment of the Preparatory Committee of the Japanese People's Democratic League in Changchun is also for this purpose."

"These most progressive leaders in China have given us broad freedom in the democratic struggle. Therefore, we will reject the imperialist leaders of the past and decide to establish a true friendship between the two nations of China and Japan."

"The Democratic Japan Daily News is determined to protect the interests of the Japanese residents in the Northeast, to establish protection for residence, property, business, and cultivation. We sincerely hope that readers will cherish this good companion on the democratic front and support it as one."

The Changchun Municipal Government, under the support of the Chinese Communist Party (the original City Hall near Datong Square was razed to the ground by the Communist army's bombs during this war, and the current Communist Party's municipal government has moved to the old Da Hing office near the railway station), has stipulated the organization of Japanese cultural and social groups. At the same time, upon the request of the Japanese People's Democratic League, the Communist Changchun Municipal Government has provided a large amount of miscellaneous grains and fuel for the use of Japanese people. In addition, so-called foreign affairs bureaus, overseas Chinese affairs sections, and ethnic affairs sections have been established.

Because we spent more days indoors and fewer days outdoors, and even when we could go out, it was only for a short time and under "protection," we really knew too little. We dare not say that Gangye Susumu is in Changchun; we certainly have not seen him. According to what we have learned in Changchun, the most active member of the Japanese Communist Party in Changchun is Nishio Saburo. He once wrote a lengthy and earnest letter to Japanese youth, titled "An Announcement for Young Compatriots to Shift Upward." It also occupied a prominent position in the inaugural issue of the Democratic Japan Daily News on the 29th. Its content is largely similar to the declaration of the Preparatory Committee of the Japanese People's Democratic League, but the article also reviews the Meiji Restoration and makes a general historical pilgrimage, and speaks of the true meaning of democratic autonomy.

There is no doubt that the Japanese Communist Party is free and active in Changchun. But how many Communist Party members they have and how large their circle of activity is are things that we cannot know.

### Spring Comes Slowly

During our detention, it was only on the 25th that we discovered that willow branches were budding. On May 1st, we two, accompanied by Baker's secretary Liu Ke, went through Datong Square to the railway station and then to several shopping malls to take a look. This was our first attempt to go out.

The next day, Liu Juying invited us to dinner. Zhou Baozhong announced at the table, "From today onwards, everyone is free to go out for interviews, to go wherever you want, and to talk to anyone you want."

The war had been over for half a month, and this war story is being written more than half a month later. What the scene after the war is like is a mystery, and how to write it? Everything has cooled down. The news value has been lost.

This is a difficult problem. We have no choice but to stroll around the market and sit in Japanese-run coffee shops to avoid continuing to be bored.

However, each of us cannot help but praise Changchun. Changchun is beautiful, with clean and wide asphalt roads. Even the stone roads are as smooth as a whetstone, paved into patterns that bring pleasure. Weeping willows and French plane trees are planted everywhere along the roads, and at this time, they are just starting to show their tender green, and we see only a faint green mist permeating the sky above the roads and the surroundings of the buildings. Although Changchun is full of collapsed buildings and broken walls, we still praise it, giving it a fair evaluation, saying that its beauty is no less than Washington, or that it can be called a small Washington, and we forget the pain of war.

The urban area of Changchun is 16,000 meters from north to south and 12,000 meters from east to west, with five parks and more than ten squares. The botanical and zoological garden is 1,200 mu in size. Looking at the urban area map (during the war, we used this map to identify the location of gunfire and all situations), although the city was not completed according to the design, we immediately recognized that this city is the best in China, and no other city can compare.

We ride in a car in the fierce spring wind, and we still have to wear leather clothes. The car stopped at the railway station. Although the trains run to the north and south, the station is silent, and we found no more than ten people waiting for the train. They look confused, only hoping that a train will come and they can take it to the place they want to go. They cannot help but feel nostalgic for the place where Beckett used to buy vodka, but when they went in to take a look, there was nothing there, not even a broken glass bottle. There was only dust everywhere.

In the center of the square in front of the station, there are four mounds of earth, probably burying four corpses, with Russian names written on them, perhaps victims of this war. But there is no place to see the Chinese people who sacrificed.

The station square is also extremely deserted, with a dozen or so Communist soldiers practicing with hand grenades.

So the car immediately returned to Datong Square, and we went to visit the Central Bank. Seventeen days ago, war was raging here, but now it is silent. Our car circled around the bank. The building is intact, but there are many bomb craters on the roof, but none of them pierced the walls, and not a single pane of the glass windows is unbroken. In the parts that were burned, the flames once came out of the window holes, licking the outside of the window holes black. A national flag, soaked with gunpowder smoke, still hangs on it, hanging for 24 hours a day, torn by the wind, suffering all kinds of torture, with no one to take care of it.

The door of the Central Bank is open, and there are no guards. We heard Liu Ke ask why. The answer was that they were afraid that there were still bombs and landmines inside. We did not go in. But we saw that countless boxes and materials originally piled up behind the back door were completely gone. A gust of wind blew, and we could only hear the broken glass still falling continuously, clanging everywhere. It was extremely desolate. Seeing this situation, we could not help but feel sad. How much blood has been shed here that has caused pain to the Chinese people and has caused the world to sigh!

It was three o'clock in the afternoon when we went to the market. We had been there once seventeen days ago. Although the three department stores had reopened, they had already closed at this time. When we went in to take a look, we saw only empty cabinets and wooden shelves with nothing on them—the owners had packed up their goods and ran home. They used to be like this, but they always had to wait until five or six o'clock. After the light of the Japanese Sun Goddess Amaterasu shone, the Japanese sought a living in this area, building wooden huts as small as cages, selling "draft beer" and Sakola, selling clothes and daily necessities, and even small furniture. This scene was everywhere in the Northeast, as long as there were Japanese residents. They sold things to make a living, and some women eventually had to sell themselves. In Changchun, the streets near the three department stores were crowded with such people. The Russian term "Upper Market" is still used now. During the Four Horse Pavilion, you only had to tell the driver, and he would take you to this place.

When we went to take a look that day, the scene was much worse than before. After the upheaval, it is not easy for any place to recover. Later, we ran into a small Japanese-run coffee shop, which looked like an ancient temple, with dim lights. When they saw us coming, a group of Japanese women were very busy. When we looked around the corner of the room, we actually found two other customers: two soldiers were drinking silently. But in less than five minutes, they slipped away.

Our car was inserted with a small red flag with the four characters "Jilin Military Region" on it, and it was carrying Americans in military uniforms, Chinese people in civilian clothes, and was protected by armed guards. Passersby cast strange glances.

Wooden arches are being built at many squares and road intersections, with wooden boards nailed into vertical walls and then painted. Many Chinese and Japanese people are working hard. When we came out again three or four days later, they were already gilded and resplendent.

The three of us still returned to our residence in a cold and desolate state. The impression we got was like this, but we boasted a lot in public, making it fascinating. Later, we all visited that small coffee shop. Later, we also discovered a dance hall called "Angel," which had Japanese dancers. According to Liu Ke, dancers are unproductive and should be prohibited in principle, but they cannot be prohibited until they have been given a proper occupation to solve their lives.

It was not until May 1st that we saw a bit of what spring looks like, which is unimaginable in the South. In this section, what we are trying to write is the first impression we got after Changchun was occupied by the Communist army. We started to retrieve "Northeast Bank Notes" worth one yuan and ten yuan issued by the Communist army from the hands of people who did business.

### Worker University

On April, a piece of news titled "Northeast Workers University Actively Preparing for Enrollment" appeared in the Northeast Daily. The news content is as follows: ""This newspaper reported that Northeast Workers University has now selected the puppet Manchukuo "Imperial Household Agency" as its school site, and is actively preparing for enrollment. There are more than three morning of students, all of whom are industrial workers in the electrical industry, railways, technicians, and other industries. They are currently repairing the new school site, and the students are doing it themselves. The work mood is very high. Many people said, 'I never dreamed that I would live in this place today.' According to Principal Wang, they are continuing to recruit students, and will send hundreds of students within days to help with the city's labor movement and other mass work. The school also plans to workers' daily to reflect the learning, life, and demands of workers, and will be published on 'May Day' Labor Day."

After lunch on May 3rd, the three of us and accompanied by Liu Ke went to the "Imperial Household Agency". At the entrance of the Imperial Household Agency, there was a brand new oil paint sign with white characters on a blue background, hanging on the sentry box, with the four characters "Workers University" written on it. There were soldiers guarding it. Our initial intention was just to come and see Puyi's palace and the stage set of the puppet regime. We ran around everywhere, and occasionally some rooms were inhabited by a few Communist soldiers, but otherwise we hardly saw anyone. This large building was simply emptied, because it was really a concentrated target. We found a palace wall that had been torn open, and a small railway track was built through it for hand carts to run, which was definitely not installed by the Communist army this time, but a relic from a considerable time ago.

The soldiers here wore a kind of badge, a symbol of the Communist army, which was the first time we had seen it. The symbol was white with red, black, and blue characters, namely the four characters "Workers University". Several fifteen or sixteen year old children were eating, also wearing this symbol. We asked Liu Ke, "Are they the university students here?" Liu replied, "No, nothing is ready here."

While we were running around, a Communist soldier who seemed to be an officer, wearing a pistol and also wearing the Workers University symbol, suddenly came and said to us:

"Where did you come from? You came in without informing us. How can you take pictures casually without permission?" - A bunch of officialdom.

We replied to him, asking him to talk to Liu Ke. Liu Ke stepped forward to explain, but that gentleman still seemed unhappy.

The Northeast used to have developed enterprises and a considerable number of industrial workers. Now, absorbing them into "university" is really something that they "never dreamed of in the past". They are clearly engaged in the training of Communist Party ideology, rather than an academic university.

Another university that appeared in Changchun was Northeast University, with Zhang Xuesi as the president and Bai Xiqing and Shu as the vice presidents. We only saw the recruitment advertisement and nothing else. The advertisement said: School address: Changchun, with a branch school in Jilin. Enrollment quota: Expected 500 people, 200 undergraduates in the medical school, 300 each in the College of Natural Sciences, the College of Social Sciences, and the College of Arts. The number of places in the research institute is unlimited, but can undertake qualifications or specialized technical equivalent academic ability to apply for the exam.

Regarding the matter of organizing "militia", we only saw it in the newspaper. The Northeast Daily on April 30th carried the following news: "Not Afraid of Thug Threats, Village Chief Tian Actively Organizes "Militia"":

"〔Bao Xun〕After Tian Fushun, a farmer representative from Qingyi District, was elected as the village chief by all the villagers, he was busy day and night doing things for the people. The bad elements in the village were not happy to see this. One night, while he was finishing his official business and lying down after returning home, three thugs shouted his name outside the door with axes, wanting his life. He hurriedly got up (since he was elected as village chief, he had been preventing bad people, so he did not take off his clothes when he slept at night), also picked up an axe, and loudly replied at the door, "When did I owe you my life? Tell me clearly, and I will pay you back. If you want money, I don't have much, but I have ten or eight yuan. Come and get it!" When the three thugs heard that things were not going well, they slipped away. Afterwards, not only was this village chief not intimidated by the thugs, but his work became even more active. He also felt that such things would definitely happen again in the future, so he actively organized the militia. In four days, he developed 23 people and asked the district to issue earth guns for self-defense." As for the captured security forces, the Communist army has reorganized them into "new soldiers" and has become "soldiers". According to the Northeast Daily on May 3rd, the article "Visiting the Prisoners of the Qian Shi Troop" on May 3rd wrote: "When serving as soldiers in the Republic of China, the officials were fighting for territory, and the soldiers did not know what they were fighting for; during the puppet Manchukuo, the troops were everywhere inside and outside the customs, fighting "bandits". After that central army, they still fought "bandits". After I joined the Eighth Route Army, the officers and soldiers are the same, and I admire them very much." The reporter then interviewed the prisoners who had been incorporated into the new soldiers: just walking to the door and seeing a group of soldiers in gray uniforms playing ball, you know that they must be the prisoners of the "Iron Stone Troop", so I immediately asked one of the soldiers: "How is it here?" That soldier was stunned, and after a pause, replied: "How is it! You can be free, you see us playing ball."

On April 25th, Changchun had electricity again, Chongqing shells, and trams began to run smoothly, but the Chinese and Soviet personnel of the China Chang Railway Company all withdrew to Harbin that day. Because "these railways belong to the Chinese people" (Zhou Baozhong's words), the Communist army took them over, and the Yamato Hotel was renamed the "Foreigner Hotel". According to the announcement, the Communist army now controls 1,300 to 1,400 kilometers of railways in East Manchuria, and 900 to 1,000 kilometers in both Manchurias.

The newspaper on May 3rd published a telegram from Yan'an on the 29th, saying that "the Northeast Democratic Allied Army peacefully entered Harbin on the 28th." At the end of April, preparations began to be made to hold a "Celebration of the Victory over Bandits and a Memorial Meeting for the Fallen Soldiers and the Masses". When we passed through our district, we only saw that the newspaper had changed the name to "Celebration of the Victory in Defending Peace", and 42 slogans were specially formulated, including the 26th: "800,000 Changchun citizens unite to defend Changchun!"

In the past, when the Communist army attacked Changchun, 800,000 citizens did not "unite", and the people were still running around calling for a ceasefire. The old people who died and were injured under the fire were still in the thousands. This time, if the government army comes to attack Changchun again, 800,000 citizens will have to "unite". How? Naturally, it is to "defend Changchun". This is the difference between the government and the Communist army. (To be continued)

### Beetle-Type Automobile

Potentially Becoming a Home, Equipped with Kitchen and Other Facilities

Unprecedented Comfort

According to a discussion by Stout of Graham-Paige Motors, the new type of automobile can become a mobile home. The seats in the car can be moved around at will. During the day, there are comfortable and movable chairs and folding tables. At night, it can become a comfortable bedroom.

Stout is the manufacturer of the "Stout Scarab" automobile. The Scarab is built according to his ideals, with the car engine mounted in the rear.

The Scarab "debuted" eight years ago, but its achievements and development have always been kept secret. The inventor of the car is currently the chief engineer of Graham-Paige Motors. After traveling 200,000 miles in the Scarab, Stout said, "I have thoroughly tested my car. Although there are many differences between it and my ideals, I have learned what should be retained and what should be discarded." It uses an ordinary engine, the size and weight of which are the same as ordinary engines. Therefore, the rear of the car is larger and higher, and there is no space for luggage except inside the car. It is only slightly more economical than ordinary cars, "but its comfort is unprecedented."

There is a fireproof wall between the engine and the car body. This wall prevents heat and noise from entering the car and forms the backrest of the seat or berth. The interior of the car is flat and wide, five to eight inches, and about ten feet long.

In front of the rear seats, there are two chairs that can be moved at will. The chairs are inclined. The seat surface is made of "foam rubber," and the armrests are wide and comfortable. The floor of the car is entirely made of thick carpet, which is no different from a living room. The driver's seat is the same as ordinary ones, and the driver's seat and the body are coordinated. It is extremely convenient for the driver to enter and exit. A door is also provided for guests to enter and exit on the side behind the car.

Stout said, "On uneven roads, we travel seventy miles per hour. People in the car, except for the driver, sit around the table to eat and drink."

"The new type of automobile may become a home, equipped with kitchen and other facilities. In any case, the car body is always wider, more comfortable, and more luxurious than ordinary ones." (Translated by American News)

### Guangxi People Turn Tears into Laughter at the Right Time

— Special Correspondent Liang Xiaozhong, Guangzhou Air Dispatch, This Newspaper, 22nd

Strange and bizarre things are like a bottle of poison being poured everywhere, dripping down bit by bit, colorful and beautiful. Onlookers feel a little dizzy and shaken. It turns out that there is a "Cultural Liaison Association" in Guilin, which has been established for several months. At first, there was indeed no friendship to be linked, but recently, it has become a mess of discussion. And this mess has indeed greatly discounted the great expectations of those who had great expectations for it (such as reporters).

### A Storm, Onlookers Split Their Sides Laughing

The story must start from the beginning: on "May Fourth" Day, the gentlemen of the Liaison Association held a warm memorial hall in the auditorium of the Teachers College Affiliated Middle School. Many "cultural figures" who had never heard of their names came. Some were constantly weeping, some were full of indignation, and after the principles of "democracy" were routinely performed, a gentleman suddenly waved his arm and raised his head, shouting loudly: "Chinese people should not accept foreign (especially American) relief." His words implied that if they accepted relief, China would be poisoned and die immediately. Then he said: "Relief is a deceptive thing. Hoover came to China to help the reactionaries to lure us. This kind of relief has sugar coating on the outside and poison inside." What a wonderful theory! The speaker, known as Wei Lin, is the editor of "Democratic Weekly" and has quite a bit of money at home. It is said that he is non-partisan. However, as soon as his theory came out, the "Guangxi Daily" reported the next day that "listeners were all surprised." The day after that, the editorial of the Central Daily News pointed out sharply: "This is a total exposure of the true face of the most inhuman neo-fascism." Readers wrote letters to various halls, accusing this Mr. Jin, who "sits at home eating comfortably and does not know the immensity of heaven and earth," of talking nonsense. After Mr. Jin read it, he immediately became furious and immediately made a serious correction, as if saying: "I didn't say a word." Then, their headquarters—the Cultural Liaison Association—sent out an ultimatum, demanding an apology from the newspaper, otherwise it would be terrible. Seeing that there was no response, they then sent out express mail telegrams, distributing them everywhere, truly in a state of "either you die or I die." It is said that they are still preparing to sue. A storm really made the onlookers split their sides laughing. Is it right to say that the Cultural Liaison Association is right? It is a bit of a conscience to listen to. Is it wrong to say that it is wrong? The Cultural Liaison Association is flying the banner of "democracy." It is indeed inconvenient to criticize it. In short, it is not just Mr. Jin who says that China should not accept relief. Until today, this case is still making a mess, but everyone's feeling towards things like the "Cultural Liaison Association" and "Democratic Weekly" is indeed a bit more than "just annoying."

### Squeezing the Soybean Dregs Dry, Where Will 50,000 Tons of Grain Come From?

No matter how people who don't touch the edge of things talk nonsense, disaster relief work cannot be stopped for a moment. When the grain supply was about to run out, fortunately, a timely rain saved many cracked fields. The late planting naturally also means a late harvest. (It still depends on God's blessing and good weather). At least new grain will be available in late July. What will happen during this period of scarcity? In three months, assuming there are 3.5 million disaster victims, this is a minimum estimate, then at least 145,000 to 150,000 tons of grain are needed to barely survive the disaster period. Guangxi is currently a piece of tofu dregs that has been squeezed dry. Where will 150,000 tons of surplus grain come from? Naturally, we can only rely on the Relief Administration, but the Relief Administration currently has only 3,000 tons of flour and 400,000 pounds of rice that have been shipped in and are still in transit. Speaking of which, one really wants to sigh: "What should we do?" So, we have no choice but to desperately launch a disaster relief movement ourselves. Disaster relief associations have been established in various places. The Guilin Disaster Relief Committee held a charity sale. Chairman Huang also donated an ancient inkstone. In the end, it only sold for more than 400,000 yuan in total. The newspaper also sold for more than 600,000 yuan. Adding it all up, it is not even enough to buy 100 dan of rice. The only hope is that the Relief Administration will increase relief supplies. Then, may Amitabha Buddha be with us.

### Using Flowery Words to Cover Up the Crime of Embezzlement

The most infuriating thing is the worst phenomenon when relief supplies are distributed. There are quite a few counties that have received relief supplies, but nine out of ten are still delayed in distributing them to this day. Some even take them and sell them, saying they are building water conservancy projects, using a lot of flowery words, hoping to cover up the crime of embezzlement. Some counties have distributed them, but the refugees each receive only ten or eight liang, while the "work remuneration" of the staff can be as much as forty or fifty jin of flour. Moreover, they openly use flour as gambling stakes and engage in large-scale debauchery, not caring about the lives of ordinary people.

The refugees in Lipu County, Guidong, did not receive flour, so they ran to the county government to cry and petition, but the county magistrate accused them of "rebellion," mobilized the police, surrounded the refugees, beat them up, and arrested the leaders from various places to "kill one as a warning to a hundred." Ah! What a democratic era of the all-powerful local tyrant!

The cries and sufferings of the ordinary people who have suffered heavy disasters are like scattered pieces of paper spread all over the world. The distribution of relief supplies is just one of the thousands of tricks. Treating the refugees like pigs and dogs is very common. There are many things that can be said at length in a long night talk. There are indeed honest and people-loving officials, but this is somewhat reminiscent of the story of finding gold in the sand. Ordinary people starve to death and can only blame heaven. Dying a death that is more painful than starvation certainly cannot but blame people!

In the past two years in Guangxi, things have been quietly changing and rapidly evolving. When will the people who have no tears to shed be able to truly smile?

### The Yell of a Soldier

Editor: Our troops have been given a special "special" character in the past. It is because of this "special" character that we wore old cotton uniforms in the summer and single cloth shirts in the winter. However, our supervisor is really good, which you might not believe. In the twelfth lunar month, he cut off the lower half of his own lined long gown, added some cotton, and made vests for the soldiers. At that time, we were indeed suffering. I remember that once, when we were surrounded by the enemy, from noon on the first day to dusk on the second day, we had nothing to eat and were a little unbearable. Being able to sleep on some straw at night was considered a "golden silk quilt." Of course, soldiers should suffer during the Anti-Japanese War. Now—now we have won. Although we dare not stand up straight and take a deep breath, we still have a little hope. The first thing that made us happy was the distribution of victory bonuses. A captain could receive 30,000 yuan. Last year, this number was considerable, but because of "pending reasons," it was not issued. "Complying with this" was wrong, and it was not issued until now. "Pending reasons" means that it is definitely going to be issued, but "complying with this" only allows half of it to be issued. I was very happy to take the seal to collect this "half victory bonus" that had been pending since last year, but the quartermaster smiled and said to me: "Your victory bonus has been removed by order of the above." The reason is that the troops were reorganized and placed in another unit in the same organization. A soldier who fought in the Anti-Japanese War for eight years had his victory bonus removed for this reason. Moreover, he was the one who was reorganized. Of course, I am not the only one, and it is not a big deal. Our treatment is 25,000 yuan for a captain, plus three dou of coarse rice, which covers all expenses. Needless to say, the soldiers' treatment is even worse. We often hear about pay raises, but "we only hear footsteps on the stairs, but we don't see anyone coming down." Even if it is a supplementary issue, although it will not suffer the same bad luck as the victory bonus, by that time, the banknotes may shrink again. Under this high-pressure life, we are really breathless. Please expose this in your newspaper and beg the adults and gentlemen to save us poor soldiers! Sincerely, Shouyi.

### Will Telecommunication Rights Still Be Lost?

Editor: It is rumored that three foreign submarine cable companies—namely, British Great Eastern, Danish Great Northern, and American Pacific—are about to resume operations. Their reasons for requesting resumption are, naturally, the same as the foreign shipping companies' excuse that Chinese ships are not enough for transportation. They say that international radio stations are congested, often causing delays. They are coming in good faith to serve and share the burden. It is currently unknown what attitude the transportation and foreign affairs authorities will take on this matter. I hope that a matter involving national rights will not be treated carelessly, right?

I remember that after the First World War, at the Pacific Conference held in Washington, my country fought hard to recover postal and telecommunication rights. After spending a lot of effort, the post offices of various countries in China were finally abolished. In telecommunications, only the wireless radio stations were resolved to be abolished, and the submarine cable part was not resolved because the contract term had not expired at that time. Later, it was not until the Nationalist government moved to Nanjing that the telecommunication transmission and reception part was recovered after several negotiations. After Japan declared war on Britain and the United States, the three companies simultaneously ceased operations. Now, calculating the contract term, according to people in the company, it has long expired. Moreover, wireless radio is now developed, so why bother with these outdated submarine cable methods? Even if there is a need to restore them, we would like to handle it ourselves. Why let others do it for us again? If the expired rights are returned as they are, wouldn't it be a joke?

Regarding the shipping issue, people in the shipping industry have shouted loudly to draw attention to the government and the public. Why is no one paying attention to this telecommunication right? I hope people in the telecommunication industry will quickly stand up and fight for it.

However, I still have one suggestion: I hope that those who work in international telecommunications will also work hard for the country and strive for speed in transmission and reception. They should also reduce errors in telegrams (I heard that there are many errors in international transmission and reception, and the transmission is slow, which is often criticized by foreigners) so as not to give others an excuse.

Spring and Autumn

### Beethoven's Two Masterpieces

— Reckless

Ludwig van Beethoven was a musical composer in the transitional period between the Classical and Romantic periods of the nineteenth century. He was born in Bonn, Germany, in 1770. Although his father was a drunkard, he paid attention to Beethoven's musical education from a young age. From childhood, he had the reputation of a musical prodigy. However, poverty and illness dominated his life, but at the same time, it was full of rich and lingering love. His works had many relationships with women. He died of illness in a Vienna residence in 1827 at the age of fifty-seven, which is considered short-lived in the West. He has many works, including nine symphonies, several model pieces, and string quartets in instrumental music, and masses in choral music and nine symphonies in operas.

I have heard a C major model piece and an F minor model piece, and I am fascinated by them. Now I would like to introduce them:

The first piece is the C major Waldstein Sonata, and the second piece is the F minor Appassionata Sonata. These famous songs are not easy to hear in China. The C major model piece was a gift that Beethoven gave to Count Waldstein. Waldstein was a descendant of a famous general in the Thirty Years' War, with a generous and heroic personality. This piece depicts Waldstein's character and deeds vividly. The heroic spirit, the generous and tragic feelings, the sweeping power, and the outstanding demeanor all depict the characteristics of the descendants of famous generals. In the middle andante section, he wrote about Waldstein looking up at the sky and contemplating silently, solemn and solemn, and desolate throughout. In the wind section, the roar is long and loud. Listening quietly with your eyes closed, it is like being in a midnight high-rise building, shaking your heart.

The passionate F minor model piece is even greater than the first piece. This piece was a gift that Beethoven gave to Count Brunsvik. In 1806, the Count's daughter, Teresa, was engaged to Beethoven. Beethoven's general enthusiasm for Teresa is embodied in this piece. From beginning to end, the whole piece is full of passion. Some people have said that it is like the bursting of the earth, erupting and impacting the sky. Beethoven himself also said: To understand this piece, you must first read Shakespeare's Tempest, which shows the power of this piece. This piece sometimes sounds like a mountain collapsing and the earth cracking, sometimes like ten thousand thunders roaring, sometimes like autumn waves surging, and sometimes like a moonlight march, making you breathless and unable to distinguish your senses. Sometimes, because your senses are too tired, you lean back on the seat and want to fall asleep, but the sound of ten thousand horses galloping in your ears makes you unable to fall asleep. Beethoven's spirit is so majestic that it is amazing, especially for Chinese people who are naturally sweet and indifferent, and who are accustomed to delicate, gentle, and peaceful melodies such as "Xiao Xiang Night Rain" and "Nine Autumn Colors." This kind of crystallization of Western culture, which is more vigorous, will indeed make you speechless.

### Time

— Yang Qiguang

I am unwilling to leave you, but I have to leave you. Who is not infatuated with the beauty of their hometown's mountains and rivers! But, can't the sound of shackles all over this land still make you alert?

Even if you don't say it, I know it all: how did humanity create history? Little by little. It is all intertwined with loud laughter and low sobs. Who doesn't have a red heart beating in their chest? When you leave this land of disaster, there are so many sad stories for you to chew on, enough for you to be angry about.

At that time, I followed a series of majestic songs and embarked on a long journey, like a summer afternoon nap, the surroundings were very hot, but I finally patted the dust off my body, began to step on the scaly mountains, and wade through the forests that stood like swords against the sky. I held up my throat, and I sang with them the greatness of the era.

But time is the most ruthless thing. In the past few years, I have watched those strong people, like camels, buried in the wind and sand, and those light people, like swallows, disappear in the shade of the trees. In the beginning, who didn't boast that they were as green as pine and cypress? But after a burst of storm, those who couldn't stand the beating fell into the dust. Those majestic songs were destroyed by the suffering and grinding, and a pale and bloody smile appeared under the dark green light, like a ghost.

At that time, I felt pain in disappointment. A beautiful deception broke my pure heart. I seemed to hear someone whispering, "Alas! A poor fool!"

"God, I saw myself in the calm and still water, and my face, which had lost its brilliance due to suffering, was now as old as an old man. I can't laugh. I don't know who deceived me. I just stand futilely on the steep hill, sending away a series of radiant days, without even the courage to take a step.

Time is a promising and fair ruler. Who is not timid in front of him? People are saying: "Time is running desperately!" But time is not running, is it? People are running themselves! Some squeeze to the front nimbly, while others squeeze to the back. But time pays the bravest with misfortune and falling, using all kinds of suffering to grind him, causing him to grow a full head of white hair? But it also tolerates those who drag behind and watch the brave people fall into the bottomless abyss, and is stingy with a little sigh. So, people no longer have the majestic singing like rivers, the green color like pine and cypress, or the broad shoulders like ancient hero statues.

You say: How did God create human history, drop by drop, all intertwined with loud laughter and low sobs. And me? I am walking in the vast and boundless wind and rain, holding a candle of life in one hand. I silently endure the emptiness and pain added to my body.

Kazayev shouted in the novel "Time, Forward!": "Everything is moving from its place, everything is starting!"

I think, if I want to eradicate the feeling of emptiness and pain, perhaps I have to "start" again!

### Sorrow

— Fei Cun

When I was a young boy, I realized what sorrow was. In the dormitory of primary school, bathed in the faint sunlight of the autumn afternoon, I heard the whistling of the small steamboats sailing to my hometown in the long river next to the school, and my little heart was covered with a layer of deep sorrow. That sorrow, which I used to describe with the words in Wang Duzhi and Dafu's poems, was the so-called nostalgia.

From boy to youth, the rich girls in the rich spring became the cause of my sorrow. On a drunken southern wind night, the melodious piano music and crisp singing overflowing from the green shade and the red building in the corner once aroused my great reverie! As a result of the reverie, I first sighed "Spring sorrow darkens my sleepless nights." It was another kind of pain.

Although it is said that "the sorrow of parting is the most painful", after all, sorrow can be quite poetic when you are idle. Some people like to immerse themselves in sorrow and enjoy a kind of sentimental pleasure, am I one of them?

The years pass quickly, and suddenly I am middle-aged. During the day, I rush around, wearing a gray coat, and at night, I often have coughs and night sweats. "Wife also says, Heaven does not understand people," in the family letters that are worth ten thousand gold, it is always the same old story: "The child is sick, the rice jar at home is running out, and all the clothes are so torn that they can't be patched up…" What kind of homesickness or spring sorrow has long been crushed by the heavy burden of reality. Now what sticks to my heart all day long is: poverty! So tight, so heavy!

Thinking of how I could write thousands of words without stopping when I was young, but now I stare blankly at the paper, unable to start, I only then began to understand what kind of state Xin Jiaxuan's line "Now I know all the taste of sorrow, but I want to say but I don't" means.

### Sympathy

— Deng Lin

Unable to see the beautiful sunset, nor the bright moon. It is said that this is the reason why the blind evoke the sympathy of humanity.

The things in the world that deserve sympathy are not limited to this. A song from heaven, the deaf cannot hear; a heart full of sorrow and indignation, the aphasic cannot speak. Even a tearful encounter, a tragic drama, is not enough to make people feel pity. Only with these imperfections does humanity develop sympathy. Otherwise, the world would seem too bland, and life too monotonous.

"However, what will arouse your sincere sympathy?" I asked, wanting to test my friend.

"This?" he replied, "It must be the disabled! They do not receive the blessings bestowed by God, they do not receive the favor bestowed by God..."

"No!" I laughed.

"Then it must be a group of orphans who have lost their homes, they have lost the warmth of family, they have lost the comfort of a loving mother..."

"Also no!" I smiled: "They are worthy of sympathy, but they will not arouse your true sympathy."

"Oh! I know," he pondered for a moment: "You are talking about the sorrow of young people! A young person who has lost the song of life. His life suddenly lost the gentle spring water..."

"Even more no!" I laughed loudly: "Although you speak well, you are not accurate. Let me tell you! It does not appear in such a grand scene, nor does it appear at such a moving moment. It only appears in the most subtle moments but can be applied very broadly." He stared straight at me.

"When a person is suffering from a toothache, when you have just gotten a toothache."

Human nature is innate. Being indifferent to the disabled. The loneliness of wandering on the wrong path is only a vague feeling for those with families. Although they also have sympathy, this sympathy lasts only a day, an hour, even a minute or a second. Afterwards, it seems like a flash in the pan, leaving no trace.

I recall a friend's words: Only in the same environment, in the same situation, can true sympathy be born.

### Partridge Sky

— Shen Yinmo

The weather shifts in my mountain residence in April, cuckoos sing amongst the azaleas, ripples gradually unfold on the glazed tiles, the color of the trees distinctly form emerald curtains. White clouds drift leisurely, interweaving with thin clothes, new feelings stir old lyrics, after not much wind and rain passing with clouds, again, light clouds carry floating silk.

### Fishing

— An Shou

Besides small streams, there are no large rivers in the mountain village, and the sea is out of the question. Although this is a county near the sea, it is separated from our village by several mountains.

Fishing alone is not very interesting, two or three people are best, more than that is not good. To be honest, I am ashamed to say that my fishing is unworthy of the name. I can't even handle the fishing line. So-called fishing is just going to the waterside with friends to have some fun.

The most annoying thing about fishing is the sun, and the next is the wind. No one has planted willows by the waterside in the mountain village, so the pleasure of "fishing in the shade of willows" is difficult to enjoy. When the sun is fierce, you will almost jump up from being burned by the sunlight if you don't wear a bamboo hat. The wind will destroy the tranquil environment, and the intense fluctuations of the water and the shaking of the fishing rod will make it impossible to calm your mind.

The best time to fish is when the setting sun is about to fall, you can rest assured of the sun, and the fish are also more likely to be hooked. I often like to choose two kinds of places to fish, one is shallow streams with yellow sand underneath, and the other is deep pools with swift currents. The former takes its quiet tranquility, and the latter takes its dynamic grandeur.

The streamside is also very poetic. Looking around, there are green forests and tender grass, mixed with a few wildflowers, and herds of cattle and sheep, like a painting.

However, a fish struggling on the beach is an unpleasant thing. Every time I return with an empty rod, it is still a good way to cultivate one's character. It would be great if I could buy a glass tank someday and raise a few fish. How interesting would it be to have slender and fat fish?

### Farewell Ode

— Gan Ge

The boat crosses the river, suddenly seeing the clouds of the homeland gradually disappear into the horizon. Going abroad, I will not see the spires of the ancient temples again. People say: "It's easy to say goodbye, but hard to meet again." How can you know that I cannot immediately ride the wind and return, silently admiring the grandeur of the Buddha once more? But when the blue sea reflects the colorful clouds on the horizon, suddenly seeing the seagulls soaring up and down, the treasure of Guanyin closely follows, sending me off from afar.

### May

— Fu Bo

May, the pomegranate flowers are red again!

During that season, I was also fascinated, I also had a flame as red as pomegranate flowers, like most young people. In the burning of this flame, I also had a life filled with hope and enthusiasm.

However, today, after the pomegranate flowers have withered and bloomed several times, I have extinguished that red flame, I have suppressed my hopes, and I have cooled my enthusiasm.

The charming breeze can no longer stir my heart, but the poetic dusk makes me recapture the scars of the past. I use tears to replace bottomless sorrow.

I ask my friend who knows my vicissitudes: "Was I wrong about the matter of love?"

"You were not wrong, you just harmed her and made yourself suffer."

Yes, I just harmed her and made myself suffer:

Four years ago, in a certain month, I was wounded in battle and retreated from the battlefront back to my hometown. She also followed me back to take care of me. Bearing the pain, in the nourishment of love, I spent two difficult Mays, and she buried her youth in my sickroom.

However, I knew that she still had the youthful feelings of pomegranate flowers, and she still had the courage to fight. How could I bear to break her wings? So, with the help of friends, I wiped away my tears and let her go, and sent her on her journey again.

But, in the second year that she soared in the free air, she sacrificed her life for the country. It was I who harmed her, it was I who sent her away...

From then on, hiding endless tears of repentance, like withered pomegranate flowers, I have no hope, no enthusiasm, and I have lost my youth.

### Flying Together (39)

— Zhao Qingge

Mrs. Mo's fatalistic remarks initially surprised Mrs. Weng the Second, because in her memory, Mrs. Mo had always been assertive and insightful. But today, she had actually changed, becoming more thoughtful and weaker. Then, after Mrs. Mo also talked about her grievances, Mrs. Weng understood that Mrs. Mo's heart had also been deeply affected by Mr. Mo's death and Zhang Mengyan's disobedience, so her outlook on life was not as positive as before! A person, if emotionally affected repeatedly, will lose confidence! That is how Mrs. Mo is now. Although Mrs. Mo cannot give Mrs. Weng the Second advice as before, Mrs. Weng still needs her comfort! Comfort is a power that increases her courage to live. Mrs. Weng the Second's environment is also not like before. In the past, Mrs. Weng the Second had to conquer her environment; Mrs. Mo acted as her commander in "conquering the environment." Now, Mrs. Weng the Second can only adapt to her environment, so Mrs. Mo should teach her to accept her fate! In short, Mrs. Mo has always been a leader in Mrs. Weng the Second's spiritual realm, and Mrs. Mo's influence on Mrs. Weng the Second is too great. However, Mrs. Weng the Second can also influence Mrs. Mo in the same way.

While they were getting into the mood, Li Yun and Li Hua, the young sisters, were also having a great time playing in the outer room. They were beginning to feel interested in this new environment. Especially Li Yun, who looked at everything in this room with great joy, while Li Hua was full of curiosity. They looked at the various framed photos hanging on the wall. Li Yun could recognize that the person in the photo was Shi Yu Lou, but Li Hua had no impression. This was precisely why Li Hua felt very curious.

"Is he a man?" Li Hua asked Li Yun, half believing and half doubting.

"Yes, he is a man. When he sings, he looks like a woman. Not only does he wear women's clothes, but even his voice and the way he walks are like a woman's." Li Yun remembered describing Shi Yu Lou to Li Hua, and she was very proud because she knew more than Li Hua.

"That's really strange!" Li Hua said, pausing for a moment. Suddenly, she innocently asked Li Yun, "So now your mother is living with this strange person? Is he your father too?"

"This, I don't know."

Li Yun couldn't answer and quickly changed the subject, leading Li Hua to look at the huqin and those guns, knives, bows, and swords. She didn't think about these unclear questions. Unlike Li Hua, who would carefully consider these unclear questions in her mind.

Just then, that strange person appeared before the young sisters.

Shi Yu Lou came back from the theater and was a little stunned when he saw the two children. Then, recognizing Li Yun, he knew that Mrs. Mo and the others had arrived.

"Xiao Yun, do you still recognize me?" Shi Yu Lou said, stroking Li Yun's head.

"I do!" Li Yun said, and then smiled and told Li Hua, "Sister Hua, it's him!"

"What's 'it's me'?" Shi Yu Lou looked at these innocent children and found it amusing.

"The person in the photo is you, right?" Li Yun asked Shi Yu Lou, pointing to the stage photo on the wall.

"That's right! You're so smart! How could you recognize that it was me?"

"Because I've seen you perform, you look like this when you perform," Li Yun said, without any restraint, as if she were very familiar with Shi Yu Lou.

Li Hua didn't say a word, only paying attention to Shi Yu Lou. She had never seen Shi Yu Lou's performance, so she simply couldn't believe that what Li Yun had just told her was true. Because the Shi Yu Lou standing in front of her now didn't look like a woman at all.

"Who is she?" Shi Yu Lou asked Li Yun, seeing Li Hua staring blankly at the side.

"She is my goddaughter!" Mrs. Weng the Second answered, as Mrs. Mo came out from the inner room.
