[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] Chairman Chiang, accompanied by his wife, visited the Ministry of National Defense at 4:00 PM on the 14th to attend the tea party hosted by the Central Party Headquarters for the representatives attending the National Assembly. Chairman Chiang, in his capacity as Director-General of the Kuomintang, delivered a speech recounting the revolutionary history of the party over the past fifty years, especially the twenty years since the Northern Expedition. He encouraged all comrades attending the National Assembly to accomplish the important task of the Kuomintang returning power to the people, to formulate a fundamental law for the country, and to unite and struggle together to grasp the current environment in order to fully realize the Three Principles of the People and gradually complete the Five-Power Constitution. During Chairman Chiang's speech, the entire audience listened solemnly and quietly for an hour and a half before dispersing with enthusiastic applause.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] The National Assembly Preparatory Committee, with the opening of the National Assembly imminent and its mission coming to an end, convened a committee meeting at 9:00 AM on the 14th in the National Assembly Hall. Committee members Wu Dingchang, Zhang Lisheng, Lei Zhen, Chen Lifu, and Secretary-General Hong Lan-you, among others, attended. Wu Dingchang acted as chairman. During the meeting, in addition to reviewing the reports submitted by various departments of the Preparatory Committee, discussions were held on how to transfer all of the Preparatory Committee's work to the Assembly, based on the provisions of the Preparatory Committee's organizational regulations, which stipulate that the Preparatory Committee's mission ends when the National Assembly opens. It was decided that the General Assembly Secretariat and the Preparatory Committee would consult on a handover date when the General Assembly Secretariat was established.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] On the eve of the opening of the National Assembly, telegrams expressing support and congratulating the Assembly on its success poured in from all directions. On the 14th, telegrams arrived in Beijing like snowflakes, sent by people's organizations and public opinion institutions in Fujian, Jiangsu, Hubei, Qingdao, Hong Kong, Beiping, Shanghai, and other places.

### Youth Party Decides to Attend; Social Elites Have Registered

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] The Chinese Youth Party has decided to participate in the National Assembly with a quota of 100 representatives. The list of names will be submitted after the Assembly opens, and registrations will be made successively.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] Those who registered today include Zhang Fakui, Wang Yunwu, Wu Shuming, Wu Jingxiong, Zhang Aizhen, Wu Yifang, and social elites Miao Jiaming, Hu Lin, Li Zhuchen, and Mo Dehui, as well as border representatives Sonam Zaxi Suohdeli and others, totaling 46 people, for a grand total of 1,420 people. Although the National Assembly opens on the 15th, people from various parties and factions and those who have not yet arrived due to transportation issues may still register at any time.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] The National Government issued an order on the 14th stating that the names of the National Assembly representatives who have been deregistered due to various reasons will be replaced by alternates. The list of replacements is published as follows: This order. Wang Kunlun, a directly elected representative of the National Government (unable to attend due to illness), has been deregistered and replaced by Wu Jingxiong. Pan Wenhua, a representative of the military (unable to attend due to defense duties), has been deregistered and replaced by Wang Shuming.

[Another Dispatch] As of the 14th, the number of news reporters registered to attend the National Assembly as observers has been largely finalized. There are 222 units from Chinese and foreign news agencies, including 43 foreign reporters and 264 domestic reporters, totaling 307 people, breaking the record for the number of news reporters attending domestic gatherings.

### Those Participating in the Consultations Claim: Government Will Be Reorganized Soon; Appealing for Peace, the Utmost Tolerance Has Been Shown

[Report from Our Newspaper] A reporter visited individuals who recently came to Shanghai from Beijing and participated in consultations, asking for their views on the current situation. They stated that the government authorities have shown the utmost tolerance for the unresolved situation. After the announcement of the National Assembly opening summons on the 12th, all procedures were completed, and invitations were sent to the envoys of various countries to attend. However, due to the desire to wait for various parties and factions to submit their lists and attend the assembly, it was postponed for another three days, demonstrating their tolerance.

The goals that the government authorities, various parties and factions, and people across the country hope to achieve are originally consistent, which is nothing more than seeking peace, unity, and democracy. However, how to achieve peace, unity, and democracy must go through a certain path, and there is no other way to take this path except to unanimously participate in the National Assembly. Negotiations that do not use the National Assembly as a medium will be even more difficult to carry out. The government has already expressed its utmost sincerity. If the Communist Party insists on not participating in the overall situation, it will be close to being autocratic and will not be tolerated by the public. It is highly possible that the Third Force will participate in the National Assembly. According to reliable sources, all parties and factions, except for a small faction within the Democratic League that is close to the Chinese Communist Party, will submit their lists within a few days. Among the social elites, except for Guo Moruo, who does not intend to participate due to an ear ailment, the rest are considering registering. If that is the case, the Communist Party's non-participation will not affect the National Assembly.

According to their observation, the government will inevitably be reorganized, and the deadline for its reorganization should not exceed one week. The National Assembly will postpone its opening for a day or two after this opening, and its recess period will have a significant impact on the government's reorganization, and the reorganization of the Executive Yuan is also inevitable. The Supreme National Defense Council may be abolished after the government is reorganized.

### Minister Bai Hosts Representatives from Xinjiang Province

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] Bai Chongxi hosted a banquet for the Xinjiang representatives of the National Assembly at the Minister's Office of the Ministry of National Defense at 6:00 PM on the 14th, with more than fifty people attending. Newsreels were also screened at 7:00 PM to add to the enjoyment.

### Representatives from Qinghai and Xikang Provinces Arrive in Beijing

Ge Jingen Arrives in Shanghai and Goes to Beijing That Night

[Central News Agency, This City] Ge Jingen, Secretary-General of the Taiwan Provincial Administrative Office, flew from Taiwan to Shanghai at 2:00 PM on the 14th and took the night express train to Beijing on the same day to register and attend the National Assembly meeting. It is reported that Ge will need to come to Shanghai again next week, delay briefly, and then go to Beijing again to continue attending the meeting.

[Another Dispatch] Ma Shouchang, Cheng Gong, Ren Faxiu, Han Shumiao, Suohdeli, Sonam Zaxi, Li Zengyin, Li Fu Can, Li Wenming, and Feng Hong, representatives from Qingdao and Xikang who arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, took the train to Beijing to register at 7:00 AM yesterday morning.

[Another Dispatch] The National Assembly representatives who left Shanghai for Beijing on the evening of the 14th included Lu Han, a representative from Yunnan, Yang Xingqin, a representative from Zhejiang, Jiang Yiping and Xi Yushu, vocational representatives, as well as Gu Yuxiu, Yu Jishi, He Zuozhi, Wang Xiaoying, Jiang Guangxu, Pan Changyou, Zhu Huiqing, Zheng Manqing, Wang Huixin, and Zheng Kuiyi.

[Report from Our Newspaper] Gu Yuxiu, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, returned from Europe and the United States a few days ago. It is said that he returned early this time to attend the National Assembly, so he rushed to Nanjing to register before the 12th. Later, due to the postponement of the National Assembly, he returned to Shanghai. On the morning of the 14th, Mr. Gu went to the Education Bureau to work, and then went to Beijing again that night to attend the meeting.

### Situ Meitang and Others Host Press Circles; Report on the Situation of the China Democratic Party

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] Mr. Situ Meitang, Yang Tianfu, person in charge of the New York Daily, Cao Guifang, person in charge of the San Francisco World Daily, Xie Zhiru, person in charge of the Canadian Hong Zhong Times, Zhu Jiazhao, person in charge of the Cuban Kai Ming Daily, and Zhu Jinshi, person in charge of the Canadian Da Han Daily, hosted press circles at 3:00 PM on the 14th. Situ Meitang and others reported on the distribution of members of the China Democratic Party and their contributions to the motherland.

### Legislative Yuan Opens Discussion Meeting Today; Discussing the Legislative Procedures for the Draft Constitution

The Jing Central Daily Advocates Submitting Amendments to the National Assembly

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] President Sun met with some legislators on the 14th to exchange views on the legislative procedures for reviewing the "Draft Amendment to the May 5th Constitution," and decided to hold a plenary discussion meeting in the afternoon of the 15th to discuss the matter together.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] Today's editorial in the Central Daily, titled "Draft Amendment to the May 5th Constitution," clearly pointed out that the draft amendment to the May 5th Constitution (editor's note: the full text can be found in the second and third editions of today's special edition), as negotiated by the Political Consultative Conference and the Comprehensive Group Constitution Drafting Committee, should be submitted to the National Assembly. The newspaper stated: "We are not satisfied with the amendment, but this draft combines the opinions of all parties and has taken into account both practical issues and the fundamental principles of the nation, so we support Chairman Chiang's decision to submit this draft to the National Assembly." Since the news of the joint review meeting of the five committees of the Legislative Yuan on the 13th, which criticized the draft constitution for violating the teachings of the Founding Father and the resolutions of the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee, was transmitted, most Kuomintang members have sympathized with it, and there have been various speculations that the government may not submit this amendment to the National Assembly, but instead submit the May 5th Constitution announced on the 25th. Those who are concerned about the overall situation are worried that the Third Force parties will therefore refuse to attend the National Assembly. Now that the Kuomintang's official newspaper, the Central Daily, has expressed this attitude, everyone feels relieved.

### The Communist Party's Method of Dealing with the Situation Is Still Delay

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] Observers in the capital, both Chinese and foreign, have seen through the Communist Party's method of dealing with the situation. The first step is to use "stop the war first, then open the National Assembly" as an excuse. When the government stops the war, they then operate in a unilateral manner and use "stop opening the National Assembly" as a prerequisite. Even during the informal comprehensive talks to discuss the content of the draft constitution, the Communist Party representatives actually said that the issue of stopping the opening of the National Assembly must be decided first, then the content of the draft constitution does not need to be discussed, which clearly shows that they do not want to solve the problem. However, although the Communist Party said that once the National Assembly is convened, they will withdraw to Yan'an, it may not be as they say, because the Communist Party is resistant to the constitution today, but they do not want a real break and decisive battle.

### The Third Force Has Made a Final Effort; Peace Talks Have Come to an End; The Communist Party Delegation Is Preparing to Withdraw

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] Peace talks came to an end on the evening of the 14th, and the attitudes of the various parties have become clear. However, social elites' representatives are still making a final effort all day long. Hu Lin flew from Shanghai to Beijing at 8:30 AM on the 14th. Zhang Junmai, Li Huang, and Jiang Yuntian also flew to Beijing at the same time. They then held a meeting at Jiaotong Bank at 11:00 AM and issued a public announcement at 12:00 PM, stating that they would still make a final effort in the remaining half day to save the critical situation. Zhang Junmai, Zhang Shenfu, Zhang Bojun, Shen Junru, Luo Longji, and Huang Yanpei then went to the Meiyuan New Village to attend a banquet hosted by Zhou Enlai. According to Zhang Shenfu's statement to reporters, they were going to bid farewell to Zhou Enlai. In the afternoon, Luo Longji, Huang Yanpei, Shen Junru, and Zhang Shenfu responded to Wu Tiecheng's invitation and went to Sun Ke's residence to meet with Miao Jiaming, Mo Dehui, Chen Qitian, Lei Zhen, and others, and held discussions until 5:00 PM before dispersing. Zhang Junmai, Li Huang, and Jiang Yuntian took the night train to Shanghai at 11:00 PM on the 14th.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] After Zhang Junmai of the Democratic Socialist Party arrived in Beijing on the morning of the 14th with Jiang Yuntian, Li Huang, Hu Lin, and others, he immediately went to Jiaotong Bank to have secret talks with Huang Yanpei first, and then participated in the "Third Force" talks. According to reliable reports, the party's attitude is that the list of representatives has actually been drawn up. Originally, it was planned to allocate 40 out of the 120 seats in the Democratic League, but it was slightly insufficient, and after pressure from the Communist Party and other members of the Democratic League, although the party said it was not constrained, the situation seemed to have changed slightly again. Zhang Junmai expressed hope for two points: (1) The National Assembly should be postponed again to open on December 1, (2) This postponement period should be used to strive for the full realization of the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, so that representatives can be sent to participate in the National Assembly. The Democratic Socialist Party's expression is tantamount to conditional participation, and other members of the Democratic League will mostly be watching the Communist Party's attitude to change. Since the Communist Party firmly insists that "the National Assembly must be stopped," it is not possible to satisfy them by postponement, so even if they want to participate, it is not convenient to express it directly. Zhou Enlai is probably already accusing some people of betraying their friends.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] Representatives of the Democratic League and social elites gathered again at the Jiaotong Bank at 8:00 PM on the 14th. The Youth Party representatives who were originally scheduled to attend did not attend. At 9:00 PM, Zhang Shenfu, a representative of the Democratic League, said that the overall situation has been settled tonight, and there is nothing more to say. What they want to say is the same as the public announcement issued at noon. Mo Dehui, Qian Xinzhi, Miao Jiaming, Hu Lin, and Li Zhuchen, five representatives of social elites, made a statement to reporters on the registration of the National Assembly, saying that on the evening of the 11th, they felt that the overall situation was on the verge of destruction, and they jointly visited the chairman to request a postponement to make a final effort to strive for peace. At that time, there was a promise. Now that the three-day period has expired, they are approved to register tonight. Qian Xinzhi also said separately that he is a representative of the Shanghai area, and he has his voters, so he cannot but participate. Huang Yanpei said that because school students must attend classes, he must go to Shanghai at noon and night, and he will still do his best for peace if he has the opportunity.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] Zhang Junmai did not make any other statement tonight. The Democratic League also did not make any statement other than the public announcement issued at noon, believing that the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference must be followed. The Communist Party is determined not to participate. Tonight, the spokesman of the Communist Party delegation said that the convocation of the National Assembly is a sign of a break. The withdrawal of the delegation has not been finalized, but it is being prepared.

[Report from Our Newspaper] Zuo Shunsheng of the Youth Party came to Shanghai from Beijing at about 8:00 AM on the 14th, and took the night train back to Beijing at 10:00 PM. He will come to Shanghai again in a few days.

### Huang Yanpei Comes to Shanghai; Prepares to Read Books Behind Closed Doors

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] Huang Yanpei, who had previously made a statement on behalf of the Democratic League declaring "temporary non-participation," yesterday told others that the Communist Party's attitude is now firm and greatly different from before. There is no hope for an agreement for the time being, so he has to retreat and not ask. Therefore, he himself does not want to participate remotely, but stays to work and mediate in the future. He is preparing to take the night train back to Shanghai on the 14th, close his doors to guests, write and read books, but he also does not want to prevent others from participating in the National Assembly. Since the Communist Party now wants to go their separate ways, the government will convene the National Assembly regardless of everything, and they can only listen to it and do it well. However, the most important thing today is the government's measures, so the National Assembly's constitution-making is secondary, and how to reorganize the government is what we are most concerned about.

### There Is Still Hope for Peace

Liang Shuming Discusses the Current Situation in Beiping

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 14th] Liang Shuming told reporters on the 14th: Peace still seems to be hopeful. He said: The current situation has indeed reached a dangerous juncture. Now all parties are groping on the edge of rupture in an atmosphere of rupture. It seems that there is still a way to save the situation, because the United States will definitely not want both parties to break up. The Third Force is also continuing its peace efforts, and the government also seems unwilling to go down the path of rupture. Under this situation, it is quite possible that the National Assembly will be postponed. If the National Assembly is not postponed, he judges that no faction of the Democratic League will submit a list of National Assembly representatives, and there is no sign that the Youth Party will submit a list. He claimed that since coming to Beiping, he has not left his house, but he does not refuse others to visit him. Li Zongren, Ye Jianying, and Zhang Dongsun have all been his guests. On the 14th, he went to Yanjing University to lecture on "Superficial and Profound," and is scheduled to fly to Chongqing on the 21st to preside over his Mianren College.

### Zhang Jia'ao Once Came to Shanghai; He Flew Back to the Capital Yesterday

[Central News Agency, This City] Zhang Jia'ao, Director of the Economic Committee of the Northeast Headquarters, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing at 2:30 PM on the 13th, and flew back to the capital at 6:30 AM yesterday. It is reported that Zhang's visit to Shanghai this time was to take care of personal affairs, and he stayed in Shanghai for only fifteen hours.

### The Government Attaches Importance to Relief in North China; Gu Zhenglun Will Go to Supervise; Hebei Provincial Government Decides to Establish a Relief Brigade

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 14th] The government attaches importance to the relief problem in the recovered areas of the National Army in North China, and will send Minister Gu Zhenglun to North China to supervise. It is heard that Mr. Gu is expected to come to North China around the 20th of this month. In addition to Hebei Province, Mr. Gu will go to Chahar, Suiyuan, and even Jin and Rehe Provinces to inspect. The central government initially approved 500 million yuan for the Hebei emergency relief fund. After Zhang Ji and Lu Zhonglin strongly argued with President Song, the Executive Yuan has increased it to 1.5 billion yuan. In addition, the Pacification District Political Affairs Committee has allocated 4,000 tons of flour and 500 tons of glutinous rice. The first batch of 2,000 tons of flour is expected to arrive in Tianjin on the 20th of this month, and the second batch of 2,000 tons will also arrive before the 5th of next month. In order to distribute the relief funds and flour, the Hebei Provincial Government will establish a relief brigade. The brigade headquarters will be located in Beiping, and will have several squadrons under its jurisdiction. The initial plan is to allocate one squadron each to Tangshan, Cangxian, and Baoding, and it is also planned to set up one squadron in Dongming, southern Hebei. According to personnel who went to Shenyang, the government's allocation of relief grain and funds is not small this time. If this flour is converted into price, it is only about 6 billion yuan. If it is distributed equally among the 300,000 refugees in Hebei, it will only be more than two catties per person, which is still a drop in the bucket.

### Our Chargé d'Affaires in India; The Indian Government Agrees to Mr. Xue Shouheng

Recently, the Indian government has agreed to Mr. Xue Shouheng, the first secretary of our special commissioner's office in India, to act as Chargé d'Affaires in India.

### Communist Troops Deploy and Ambush, Fierce Fighting Erupts in Jinan Suburbs, Communist Troops in Northern Jiangsu Invade and Harass Everywhere

[Report from our Jinan Office, 13th] During their period of standstill, the Lu Communist army continued to reinforce and redeploy, seeking opportunities to attack the National Army. On the evening of the 12th, more than a thousand Communist police brigade soldiers suddenly attacked Xinglongzhuang (ten kilometers south of the city), outside Jinan. The National Army defended itself and fought back. On the 13th, the Communist army was unable to withstand the attack and retreated south. Their "Liberation Seventh Division" main force and "militia," totaling over ten thousand, advanced west from Tao Tangkou, fiercely attacking Qidong County city via Sunjia Town. The National Army was forced to engage, and fierce fighting is still ongoing in the suburbs.

[Report from our Jinan Office, Bian, 14th] The situation in the Jinan suburbs, from the evening of the 12th to the morning of the 14th, was tragic. The Communist army continued to mobilize reinforcements and artillery from the Bohai Military Region, fiercely attacking Qidong (located northeast of Jinan, north of Zhangqiu). The National Army is fighting desperately to defend it. On the night of the 13th, a portion of the Communist Police Seventh Brigade and about six thousand men from the Boxingdian and Rao Independent Battalions fiercely attacked Linzi County city. The National Army fought back valiantly, and after a fierce battle, the Communist army finally collapsed and retreated to the east and west of the ancient city north of Linzi on the morning of the 14th.

[Report from our Xuzhou Office, 14th] Yuan Ye, commander of the Communist Bohai Military Region, recently led more than 20,000 Communist troops, fleeing from Huimin in northern Shandong to Linyi, plotting to attack Jinan. In the Xin'anzhen area of the eastern section of Suihai in northern Jiangsu, thirteen Communist regiments are currently massing, plotting to invade Suqian.

[Report from our Xuzhou Office, 14th] More than 50,000 Communist troops of the "Northeast Democratic Allied Army" are now concentrated at Dayunkou, awaiting transport by boat to Yantai.

[Report from our Zhenjiang Office, 14th] After the ceasefire order was issued, the Communist armies of Lian, Shu, Yan, and Fu continue to stir up trouble from time to time, and intensify their requisition of labor and grain, making life unbearable for the people. Representatives from the aforementioned counties have now gone to the capital to petition the government to quickly send troops to be stationed there, to relieve the people from their suffering.

[Report from our Zhenjiang Office, 14th] After the ceasefire order was issued, the Communist army of Binhai, Dongtai, continuously attacked the National Army in Qizao and Jiuzao counties. The garrison at Qizao was once caught off guard. Later, the National Army stationed in the city rushed to their aid, and after a day and night of fierce fighting, the Communist army was unable to withstand the attack and collapsed. Furthermore, it is reported that fighting occurred near Qizao yesterday, and the National Army stationed there was forced to engage.

[Report from our Zhenjiang Office, 14th] It is reported that a portion of the Communist army in northern Jiangsu recently suddenly fled to Rugao County, where more than a thousand people who were unable to escape were massacred.

[Central News Agency, Huaiyin, 14th] Since receiving the ceasefire order, the National Army in various parts of northern Jiangsu has remained on its original defense. On the evening of the 12th, a portion of the Communist army, numbering over five hundred, launched a fierce attack on the National Army at Dada of Xinghua East. The National Army there is currently steadfastly holding its ground. Also, a dispatch from Huaiyin on the 14th reports: More than three thousand Communist troops fiercely attacked Zhoujing River, southeast of Baoying, at 7:00 AM on the 13th. The National Army there, in addition to holding its ground, did not counterattack.

[Report from our Beiping Office, 14th] It is reported that: (1) Lin Biao and He Long are currently in Yan'an attending a military conference; (2) The Chinese Communists in Yan'an recently recruited thirty-seven regiments and more than twenty thousand militiamen, planning to launch a large-scale attack on Yulin.

### The Communist Side Has Not Yet Responded to the Ceasefire Memorandum

[Report from our Beiping Office, 14th] The Communist side of the Military Mediation Execution Department has not yet responded to the government's ceasefire memorandum, but there is no sign that they are about to withdraw. Communist spokesman Huang Hua told reporters on the 14th that the Military Mediation Execution Department can only accept orders from the military three-person group and take action accordingly. The Communist side of the Execution Department believes that there is no need to consider matters individually raised by Chairman Chiang. The spokesman denied reports that the three committee members of the Execution Department will hold a meeting, saying that neither side has proposed a meeting recently. It is also inaccurate to say that the Execution Department will hold a meeting to restore traffic. As of the afternoon of the 14th, the Communist side of the Execution Department has not received any orders or instructions from Yan'an or Nanjing regarding withdrawal, nor has it made any preparations for withdrawal. The Military Mediation Execution Department still has flights between Beiping and Yan'an every Wednesday. Yesterday's flight only carried Mr. Smorson, representative of the British Liberal Party newspaper, and Mr. Jode Drake, reporter for the Associated Press. Mr. Hurleigh, reporter for the New York Times, was brought back from Yan'an. No Communist personnel traveled back and forth. According to the spokesman, there are still more than thirty Communist personnel working in the Execution Department, and if the personnel dispatched to various groups are included, there are still about two hundred people.

[United Press, Beiping, 14th] Zheng Jiemin, the government representative of the Beiping General Mediation Department, took a plane to Nanjing.

### Regulations on the Disposal of Real Estate Purchased by the Soviet Union in Changchun Stipulate that Purchase Is Permitted but the Land Must Be Leased

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 13th] The Changchun City Police Department recently requested instructions from the Changchun Branch of the Northeast Enemy and Puppet Enterprise Assets Unified Receival Committee on how to handle the fact that the Soviet Far East Trading Company, jointly organized by the Soviet government and the China Changchun Railway after "August 15" last year, had purchased Japanese-owned real estate in Changchun that should belong to the Chinese government. The Changchun Branch of the Unified Receival Committee considered this matter to be of great importance and requested instructions from the General Committee. The General Committee considered the matter to be a matter of diplomacy and telegraphed Foreign Minister Wang Shijie for instructions. A reply telegram was received, stating that the houses purchased by the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Trade from the Japanese should still be leased or borrowed after they are returned. If the Soviet Union refuses to accept this method, in order to show friendship to the Soviet Union, they may be purchased in particular, but the land on which the houses are located must be leased on a regular basis. This is the most favorable treatment that third countries can currently enjoy, etc. Zhang Jiaao, chairman of the General Committee, immediately formulated a plan according to the instructions in the telegram. The main points are as follows: (1) The Central Government, in order to express special friendship, specially allows the Soviet side to have the right to purchase a fixed amount of property in the Northeast. This right is limited to one time and cannot be used as a precedent or a fixed right; (2) In order to avoid disputes, the Soviet side should be asked to specifically and clearly propose the area and location of the property and the attached leased land that it intends to purchase. We will send personnel to conduct a joint survey. If there is no possibility of a dispute over property rights, it will be treated as public property, and then a contract will be signed; (3) The Chinese side of the contracting parties is the agent designated by the municipal government; (4) The lease term is set at ten years. If the lease is to be renewed after the expiration of the term, both parties may negotiate an extension, but the maximum extension shall not exceed three years; (5) After the expiration of the lease term, the houses shall be returned to China at no cost. If the houses are damaged and need to be rebuilt before the expiration of the lease term, the consent of the lessor must be obtained, and they must still be returned to China at no cost upon expiration; (6) The use of the land is limited to the ground, and no digging or installation of electrical infrastructure or military facilities is allowed; (7) The lessee shall bear the obligations stipulated by Chinese law; (8) The leased or purchased houses shall not be transferred, sold, mortgaged, or sublet. According to reporter inquiries, the Soviet Far East Trading Company purchased a total of forty-one houses in Changchun, with a total purchase price of 3,925,000 yuan. The house prices were all paid in Soviet military notes.

Responsible Person of the External Affairs Talks

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] After the announcement of the measures for handling the purchase of real estate by the Soviet Union in Changchun, reporters visited responsible persons of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to understand the truth. It is said that "After Japan surrendered last year, the Executive Yuan announced that all Japanese property within Chinese territory, whether belonging to the Japanese government or private individuals, shall be taken over by the Chinese government as part of Japan's compensation to China. Without the permission of the Chinese government, the ownership of this item shall not be transferred. Our government has notified the Soviet side of this intention. In the future, if the Soviet side wants to purchase real estate in various places, it must still be with the permission of our government."

### UNRRA Far East Regional Conference Concludes, Passes Important Recommendations, Requests the Headquarters to Completely Cancel the Embargo Order

[Report from our newspaper] The UNRRA Far East Regional Committee held a meeting in Shanghai the day before yesterday to elect a chairman and discuss relief work, supplies, and funding. It ended at 5:00 PM yesterday. During the meeting yesterday, the US representative suggested that the conference pass a proposal requesting the Washington Headquarters to completely cancel its order to stop the transportation of supplies to China. The Soviet representative stated that UNRRA Director General LaGuardia had previously decided to announce the suspension of transportation order for two reasons: (1) Because Chinese ports had not been cleared, it was temporarily inconvenient to transport a large number of supplies; (2) Because some of the supplies transported to China had political implications. Therefore, he requested that this suggestion be considered before a decision was made. Li Zhuomin, Deputy Director General of the Administrative Yuan Relief Committee, immediately declared that the ports in the city had been cleared, the supplies had been declared, and he guaranteed that the supplies received would have no political implications. The conference passed a request to the UNRRA Headquarters to completely cancel the suspension of transportation order.

Funding Issues of the Administrative Yuan Relief Committee

During the meeting yesterday afternoon, many opinions were expressed regarding the source of funding for the Administrative Yuan Relief Committee. UNRRA British representative Stant expressed that UNRRA's work in China had not been fully developed due to a lack of funding, and he hoped that the Chinese government could provide assistance to the Administrative Yuan Relief Committee. US representative Gaber Que Lire pointed out that even including all income, the Administrative Yuan Relief Committee was still short of 130 billion yuan by the end of this year. Could this be subsidized by the Executive Yuan? Mr. Shi also said that UNRRA's sale of supplies should not be the main source of income for the agency, but should be a secondary source of income.

Li Zhuomin immediately explained that the Administrative Yuan Relief Committee's funding came from the sale of supplies, government subsidies, and a portion of bank loans. The income from the sale of supplies was actually limited. Not only was it difficult to collect money for the sold items, but the transportation costs were also difficult to meet, and other income was not sufficient to make up for it.

Study of the Situation in Korea

The conference also passed a motion to elect Soviet representative Siminas as chairman of the small group studying the situation in Korea, and requested that the Korean delegation send personnel to report on the group's disaster relief situation in order to actively carry out the work. It was also decided that the next conference will be held on January 15 next year.

### Luo Heng and Zhang Bangzhen Discuss the Sino-French Vietnam Issue

[Central News Agency, Bian, 4th] After the Sino-French negotiations on the Vietnam issue came to an end, reporters specially visited Miss Luo Heng and Miss Zhang Bangzhen, representatives of the Yunnan National Assembly, to ask for their opinions on Sino-French relations. It is said that the friendship between China and France should be enhanced, but the Vietnam issue is related to the interests of overseas Chinese and Yunnan, and should be resolved as soon as possible. At present, the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway has not yet been repaired, which has a great impact on the economic transportation of Yunnan and the southwest. Overseas Chinese have not yet received reasonable treatment, and the public and private property looted and destroyed by the Japanese in Vietnam during the war has not yet been liquidated and compensated, all of which urgently need to be implemented. Because Yunnan borders Vietnam, the people of Yunnan are particularly concerned about the resolution of the Vietnam issue.

### Editorial: A Fair Discussion of the Draft Constitution

--And Congratulations on the Opening of the National Assembly

Since the National Assembly was postponed to today, and the Joint Conference of the Five Committees of the Legislative Yuan did not review the revised draft of the May 5th Constitution Draft Amendment, the issue of the constitution has been of concern to the world. The purpose of convening the National Assembly was to draft a constitution, and the drafting of a constitution requires a draft constitution as a basis. The National Assembly, which is dedicated to drafting a constitution, is scheduled to open in Nanjing today, but the revised draft of the May 5th Constitution Draft Amendment, which was submitted by the chairman to the Legislative Yuan for review and amendment based on the "Political Consultative Conference" amendment principles, has not yet been adopted and reviewed by the Legislative Yuan. Therefore, the focus of the current political situation is undoubtedly on drafting a constitution to establish a solid foundation for the country's long-term stability.

The reason why the Legislative Yuan did not accept the review of the revised draft of the May 5th Constitution Draft Amendment this time is reportedly because the procedure for submitting it for review did not comply with the regulations. This case did not result from a resolution of the Central Standing Committee or a resolution of the Supreme National Defense Council, but was only issued to the Legislative Yuan by the Chairman by telegram. This case is of great importance, and it seems that it does not comply with the regulations. If the Legislative Yuan's review of the revised draft of the Constitution Draft Amendment is only a procedural issue, then it is simple; it also includes a substantive issue, that is, whether the provisions in the revised draft are contrary to the Three People's Principles upon which our country is founded. This is an important issue. As far as the Legislative Yuan is concerned, it already has the May 5th Constitution, which was promulgated by the National Government, unless there are instructions from the Central Standing Committee or the Supreme National Defense Council, it is not appropriate to change it rashly. This position can be understood by the people of the country. Law is not outside human feelings, and we cannot erase the current objective facts with one stroke. Regarding the procedure, it was originally due to time constraints that this expedient measure had to be taken; now that it has been raised, supplementing the procedures may make it comply with the provisions of the legislative procedure in a timely manner. However, the problem is still lurking; the so-called procedural issue is only another manifestation of this lurking problem.

What is this lurking problem? First, the May 5th Constitution was promulgated by the National Government based on the constitution draft passed by the Legislative Yuan. The "Political Consultative Conference" is an organization outside the national legal system, and its resolutions have no binding effect on the National Government; the constitution draft already promulgated by the National Government cannot be rashly cancelled due to the resolutions of the "Political Consultative Conference." This is theoretically beyond reproach, but the distance from the current objective facts is too far. It seems more advisable to accept reality. It is true that the "Political Consultative Conference" is a type of organization outside the national legal system, and its resolutions naturally do not have their legal status and effect; but if this informal resolution without legal effect is accepted by the government through proper procedures, it may be regarded as a kind of will of the government itself, and thus have an effect. At this time, we do not seem to need to adhere to legal principles, and there are many things that are not completely understandable in theory.

But the core of the problem is still: Does the revised Constitution Draft Amendment, which was revised based on the constitutional amendment principles passed by the "Political Consultative Conference," truly conform to the spirit of the Three People's Principles? Here we must eliminate two preconceived notions: (1) Although the May 5th Constitution was drafted in accordance with the spirit of the Three People's Principles, it may not necessarily be the best expression of the spirit of the Three People's Principles, and it is absolutely not allowed to be revised; (2) Although the resolutions of the "Political Consultative Conference" are made by various parties and factions as well as non-party and non-factional people, they may not necessarily be contrary to the spirit of the Three People's Principles. There are no established rules to follow for drafting the Three People's Principles Constitution, and all facts are first created. The drafting of the May 5th Constitution previously took great effort and fully reflected the spirit of the Three People's Principles; but given the evolution of the past ten years, especially in recent years, it is questionable whether the system it established is the most ideal. Therefore, we must absolutely not stick to preconceived notions and think that only the May 5th Constitution is the most ideal expression of the spirit of the Three People's Principles. As for the resolutions of the "Political Consultative Conference," although there are places that are not very closely tied to the Three People's Principles, they are not necessarily entirely contrary to the spirit of the Three People's Principles. According to news reports, the revised constitution draft that the government intends to submit to the National Assembly but has not yet been reviewed by the Legislative Yuan still adheres to the strict position of the Three People's Principles while complying with the resolutions of the "Political Consultative Conference." It is very obvious that its revision is not necessarily contrary to the spirit of the Three People's Principles; moreover, our Chairman and Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke personally gave instructions on the drafting of this amendment, so it can be imagined that its basic position is not contrary to the Three People's Principles. Therefore, this revision of the constitution should be able to serve as the basis for the National Assembly to draft the constitution.

Now that the National Assembly is holding its opening ceremony, the fundamental law of the country, which is the basis for our country's long-term stability, will be formulated by the Assembly and put into effect. What we cannot but state here is that although the National Assembly representatives come from all sides, they should have a common ideal of building a new China of the Three People's Principles. The drafting of this constitution should fully express the spirit of the Three People's Principles. Therefore, we cannot stick to preconceived notions, but since the constitution is the fundamental law of the country, we cannot be hasty and must review it thoroughly before it can be effective. How can we enable our country to have a perfect constitution? This depends on the convening of this National Assembly. On the occasion of the opening of the National Assembly, we extend our sincere congratulations to the National Assembly. May the convening of this National Assembly lay the foundation for our country's long-term stability!

Director Dong of the Finance Department promised to give more instructions, which are of great significance to the financial and tax relations of Jiangsu Province in the future, and have a great impact on the interests of the people. Suzhou will briefly record the following major cases:

Issues Regarding the Handling of Grain Collection

(1) Regarding the handling of in-kind collection of land tax, Jiangsu Province has been ordered to sell all of it to the central government at price, and all counties and cities must not use it without authorization. However, in order to take into account the urgent needs of the localities, the Provincial General Office has drafted two methods: A. Counties that collect public grain should receive 15 percent. This number can be issued by the county and city for consumption by the security police team. If it is still insufficient, a portion can be allocated from 50 percent of the land tax; B. The land tax will be allocated and sold to the central government, and the price will be evaluated monthly to avoid losses to the localities, and the Ministry of Food should first allocate two-thirds of the funds, and the remaining amount will be settled after the grain tax is paid. However, the above methods should be implemented after obtaining the consent of the central government. (2) The management issues of county and city pawnshops shall be jointly formulated and implemented by the Finance and Construction Bureaus. (3) Regarding the public treasury system, county and city deed tax, business tax, business license tax, house rent, banquet tax, entertainment tax, and other tax revenues shall be collected by personnel dispatched by the public treasury to the collection agency. However, rural areas can submit them on a ten-day basis. (4) Regarding the reorganization of public funds and property, the county and city finance section chiefs shall be practically responsible for thoroughly abolishing the previous system of earmarked funds. The clearing period has been extended to June 36. (5) Regarding the issue of township production, according to the principle of national mandatory labor service, the surplus manpower during the agricultural off-season should be utilized, and with the approval of the township people's representative congress, production undertakings such as wasteland reclamation, afforestation, animal husbandry, fish farming, and small-scale handicraft industry should be engaged in without hindering the work of the farmers themselves. If a small amount of working capital is needed, loans can be obtained from the Agricultural Bank. Fifty percent of the income will be used for national education expenses, and the rest will belong to the original township as self-government expenses. Counties and cities are not allowed to use it. (6) The county and city governments must approve and issue the regular expenses of the county-level agencies by the 10th of each month at the latest. (7) If the enemy and puppet materials received by the county and city have been spent, the proceeds should be remitted to the treasury in full.

Issues Regarding Taxation Collection

(8) The collection of donations and taxes should be based on direct inspection and collection as a principle, and the recognition method is only a temporary measure. Once assessed, there will often be refunds. (9) Counties and cities should actively start to complete the survey form of people's economic burden. (10) Loans from the past to localities should be repaid in full before the land tax is fully paid. (11) The financial policy in the future should be to reorganize various legal tax sources, and no new taxes should be created. County and city budgets should not collect income falsely and spend it actually, and a reserve fund should be retained to adjust the salaries of public school employees. It is known that Director Dong and his party will come to Wujiang to inspect on the morning of the 15th, and return to the province that evening. They will go to Songjiang again on the 23rd of this month to convene a review meeting for the fourth district.

### Two Ships Robbed Outside Zhenhai Port

[Ningbo dispatch] Two ships sailing between Ningbo and Jintang Dapu, Lao Da Zhang Afang and Rong Chengliang, carrying more than 30 passengers, including Li Yongchun, departed from Yong at 1:00 p.m. on the 8th. When they arrived outside Zhenhai Port, it was already dusk. Due to the tide, they temporarily anchored in the Qingzhi waters. At the same time, a red and white bottom sailboat (pirate ship) from Zhenhai was heading to Shenjiamen. Ship captain Zhang Afang saw that its actions were suspicious and was about to raise anchor to escape. Unexpectedly, the pirate ship fired a gun to scare them into not moving, and then approached the stern of the ship. Another ship, seeing that the situation was not good, also wanted to escape back. At that time, the bandits fired very fiercely, and there was no way to avoid it, and it was also harmed. At that time, the two ships were dragged to the waters between Jintang and Dapu, and the passengers were looted for three hours, with a total loss of 50,000 yuan in gold and silver jewelry, items, and cash. After the robbery, they left safely.

### Three Bandits Executed in Zhuangxing; Peace in the Border Area of Song and Feng

[Our newspaper's Fengxian dispatch] The three bandits, Mo Degang, Wu Ahai (from Songjiang), and Li Ahong, were remnants of the bandit Yang Kequan's gang.

The remnants are now also subject to the law. From now on, the security of the border area can be assured.

### Commercial Decline in the Punan Area

[Our newspaper's Fengxian dispatch] In the Punan area, agriculture, industry, and commerce have been greatly weakened by the situation in recent years. This year's cotton and rice harvests were poor, and the economy is even more stagnant. After entering winter, agricultural products have depreciated step by step. Cotton is less than 30,000 per dan, and white rice is only about 40,000 per shi. Other daily necessities have risen sharply. As a result, the rural economy is on the verge of bankruptcy. Industry and commerce have been affected in conjunction. The purchasing power of the general public has declined, and the business of various merchants has plummeted. Even the landlords only receive 20 to 30 percent of the rent.

More than a hundred people rushed to Xing's house in Xisha Village, demolished the house, destroyed property, and tied Xing up with ropes, causing serious injuries with iron tools. After his family accompanied him to the city to report, the County Rent Collection Office immediately telegraphed County Magistrate Lu and requested immediate emergency action. Upon hearing the report, County Magistrate Lu believed that this trend must not be allowed to grow and dispatched the County Police Detachment Commander Liu Ren, leading 40 squad soldiers fully armed, to the scene of the incident in the countryside, together with the township office of the district in charge. They immediately arrested Wu Caibao and other five tenant farmers who instigated and incited, and escorted them to the city for detention on the evening of the 12th, pending interrogation and severe punishment.

### Guaranteeing Traveler Safety; Long-Distance Buses Defend Themselves

[Our newspaper's Wuxi dispatch] Long-distance buses running on various highways in Jiangsu Province are often robbed by bandits, and bandits posing as passengers lurk in the car and take the opportunity to rob. The safety of travelers is endangered, and the military and police protection in remote areas of various lines is inevitably inadequate. In order to actively prevent and ensure the safety of travelers, the Provincial Construction Department believes that it is necessary for various long-distance bus companies to establish self-defense armed forces to protect them along with the bus. It has notified various long-distance bus companies operating on each line to comply as soon as possible and ordered the Highway Bureau to instruct other commercially operated long-distance bus companies to comply. The county governments are ordered to supervise strictly.

### Military and Police Conflict in Bengbu; Turns Into a Bloody Case; Murderer Arrested

[Our newspaper's Bengbu dispatch] Soldiers from a certain secret service battalion stationed in Bengbu suddenly clashed with the city police over a trivial matter on the morning of the 11th, resulting in a bloody tragedy. According to the investigation: at about 11:00 a.m. on the morning of the 11th, soldiers from the First Company of a certain secret service battalion were transporting rice bags in a truck, and when they arrived in front of the Traffic Villa on Erma Road, they crashed into a rickshaw and quarreled and fought with the rickshaw puller. Several policemen from the Third Branch of the police happened to pass by and stepped forward to mediate. A certain soldier got angry at the policemen and beat them in the street. The policemen took the offending soldier and the rickshaw puller to the station for interrogation. Before long, many more soldiers gathered and broke into the Third Branch, beating everyone they saw and taking away the household registration officer Yang Mingyi. The offending soldier also left with him. Many policemen chased to Wuchalu, and the soldiers opened fire, wounding three policemen. For a time, soldiers ran around the streets, beating any police officers they saw, resulting in a two-hour strike in the afternoon. Upon hearing the report, the Pacification Commander Xia Wei immediately ordered a stop and detained the company and platoon leaders responsible for the incident.

### A Large Number of Traitors Hide in the Border Area of Jia and Tai

Criminal Police Go to Search and Arrest Three People

[Our newspaper's Jiading dispatch] The Muyi County Government received a letter from the Taicang County Government, stating that a large number of former enemy and puppet personnel were hiding in the border area of the three counties of Jiabao and Tai, oppressing the villagers and committing many evils.

### Suzhou Restricts the Pawnbroking Industry; Absolutely No New Establishments Are Allowed

[Our newspaper's Suzhou dispatch] The pawnbroking industry in this county has heavy profits to be made, so those with idle funds regard it as a way to make money and flock to it. When the guild was established this spring, it was estimated to have only dozens of shops. Afterwards, they were added one after another, almost like bamboo shoots after a rain. Everywhere, whether on the main street or in the alley, only one corner outside Jumen has more than 20 shops according to the survey. It is estimated that there are more than 100 shops in total. However, the interest rate is high, and the poor who trade with them are like drinking poison to quench their thirst. All sectors of society have repeatedly appealed to the government to establish public pawnshops as a remedy. Unexpectedly, according to a recent survey, the entire Suzhou pawnbroking industry is depressed due to too many businesses, and their operations are not flourishing. In addition, the expenses are huge, and there are too many losses. Those who do not have the means to transfer to the point of bankruptcy cause a threat and extreme pain to the poor. The County Government has noticed this and, in addition to actively planning to widely establish public pawnshops, has decided on emergency measures and warned Wang Renchu, the director of the trade guild, that as of today, no new pawnbroking shops are allowed. In order to avoid social unrest, those that have been established are restricted and are not allowed to be merged or relocated, and those that have been closed and are waiting to be redeemed are not allowed to be replaced and reopened, so as to reduce the deeper crisis in the future.

The court has sentenced them to imprisonment. Wu Jiangbai, the president of the local Shenbao newspaper, accused Director Qi of knowingly protecting Wang Guangrun in the case and reported him to the District Prosecutor's Office for corruption. He has been notified to answer the investigation several times. Now that Qi has been ordered to be dismissed and the new director Yuan Bosong has arrived in Songjiang to take office, Wu Jiangbai has filed a complaint with the Prosecutor's Office requesting that Qi Shubiao be detained and prosecuted as soon as possible.

### The Sujia Highway Will Be Fully Open to Traffic Next Month

[Our newspaper's Wujiang dispatch] Since the Sujiahu Long-Distance Bus Company resumed traffic in May last year, it has only been running between Suzhou and Nanxun due to the serious damage to the roadbed and bridges, which has greatly facilitated the communication between Jiangsu and Zhejiang and made it convenient for the people. It is now known that the section of the highway from Pingwang to Jiaxing has been repaired. The company has specially added 12 new-style passenger cars, which have been transported to open the Pingwang-Shengze section first from the 16th of this month.

### The Appeal of the Barber Stall Owners

We are a group of barber stall owners in the alleys of the city. There are more than 4,000 people in the city who make a living from this, excluding family members. Although our business locations are scattered in the streets and alleys, they have all been legally leased, and we have fully considered traffic and hygiene issues. It can be said that there is no situation of "obstructing hygiene and hindering traffic."

Our customers are salaried workers and the working class, because the price we charge is only one-half of that of ordinary shops, so we are deeply praised by the public.

On the 10th of last month, the Barber Industry Guild of this city convened a representative meeting of various districts. They reported a proposal: "Street stalls are crowded, and business in the shops is sluggish. The guild has submitted a request to the police authorities to ban them. A reply from the mayor has been received, approving the ban, and the Health Bureau will send a letter to the police bureau and the health sub-stations to conduct inspections at any time," and so on.

Poor us, a small group, live the most humble lives. Seeing such a shocking message, we were all dumbfounded, as if a thunderbolt had struck on a sunny day. If a ban were to be implemented, we have no other skills, and it is impossible to steal. Apart from "waiting to die," what other options do we have? But as the days passed, we did not encounter a ban.

Seeing that we were still operating as usual, the trade guild was determined to put the lives of thousands of us to death and submitted a supplementary application to aggravate our crime, saying that we "obstruct traffic and harm hygiene." The so-called "if you want to condemn someone, there is no need to worry about finding an excuse." If our stalls had violated the two clauses they mentioned, the police authorities would have already started to ban them without the trade guild submitting a document. Thinking from this point of view, it is entirely a matter of jealousy in business, which is the most obvious fact.

Recently, our misfortune has come. The police bureau has really approved their request to implement a ban and set a deadline for closing the business. We are not capitalists, and we have no backing. We are poor stall owners, who dare to disobey orders. In the absence of any other options, we have no choice but to petition the authorities and ask people from all walks of life to sympathize with us and give us a way to survive. (Zhou Xuequan)

### Why Shanghai Doesn't Ban Dancing

"Dance halls" - what a pleasant and beautiful name. However, their existence, whether directly or indirectly, what benefit do they bring to the nation and society? I can make a firm statement: "They are entirely harmful and bring no benefit." I know many people will think I am exaggerating, but the facts are as follows:

How magnificent is its (the dance hall's) appearance, with waves of exciting and enthusiastic music, and melodious singing, broadcast on the streets every night. But what about its inner reality? Sin, shamelessness, baseness, decadence. How many ambitious young people fall here, how many honest and upright officials become corrupt because of it, how many law-abiding people resort to theft, extortion, and deception because they come here! What is most heartbreaking is that a group of intellectual young people from the highest institutions of learning have abandoned their precious books and are hiding here, wasting their time!

This sinful dance hall - a gold-consuming pit in the city - directly bewitches many clear-headed people, sucks up a lot of ill-gotten money, and indirectly affects the peace of the entire society and the strength of the nation. Since this is the case, why should it exist? Is it a necessary embellishment for a big city? Or is it because this kind of entertainment is popular in the United States, and our poor country should also try to imitate it?

Suppose: if the capital of all the dance halls in the city were pooled together to open a larger factory, imagine how many unemployed workers could be helped, and how many practical goods could be produced? This would be truly embarking on the road to building a new China.

If dance halls are closed, the most serious issue is how to solve the livelihood problems of the dance hostesses. Many, many people say: the dance hostesses are pitiful, their offering of hugs and embraces is entirely out of desperation due to the pressure of life. However, I must solemnly say, "They are not pitiful at all." The reason they engage in this profession is not entirely driven by life; half of it is due to their own wrong thinking and excessive vanity. They also have a pair of all-powerful hands. In the beginning, they could have tried to find another job. Why did they have to step into the circle of sin? Of course, they wanted to be more comfortable and earn more money, so they jumped into the deep pool without hesitation. Imagine, at a time when the country is plagued by war, disasters, and widespread suffering, do we still need to pity these people who have lost their way due to their pursuit of vanity and enjoyment?

In conclusion, dancing is an improper form of entertainment. Moreover, with the nation's destiny precarious and the country's construction difficult, how can we continue to indulge in the intoxicating pleasures of sensual entertainment? We should ban it, eliminate it. What is puzzling is that dancing has already been banned in places like Nanjing and Hangzhou, so why can't it be implemented in Shanghai alone?

Finally, I hope the municipal government authorities can accept my suggestion. (Wang Huang)

### Mail on Behalf

In response to Mr. Renxin's letter stating a case of harsh fines by the Yinghe Tax Office, we have received a letter from Zhu Zhongyan, Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce of Yinghe Town, Shouxian County, and Long Youfu, a merchant, stating: "We read Mr. Renxin's letter in the 'Readers' Opinions' column regarding various matters concerning Director Gao of the Commodity Tax Collection Office in Yinghe, Shouxian, and we are extremely surprised. Since Mr. Gao arrived in Yinghe, he has handled affairs peacefully and has gotten along well with the local community. We have not heard of any cases of punishing merchants. There is also no person named Renxin in Yinghe. We fear it is a fabricated name to damage his reputation, so we specially write this letter to clarify."

In response to the female workers of Fubeikang: The female workers of the Fubeikang Cosmetics Company in this city sent a letter appealing for an adjustment in their treatment. We have received a reply from the company stating: "Since October, wages have been fully adjusted. Although workers do not have days off on Sundays, they receive additional salary increases at the end of the month. If there are any shortcomings, we are working on ways to improve them."

### French Communist Party Demands the Premiership Decides to Negotiate with the Socialist Party to Form a Coalition Government Bidault Convened a Cabinet Meeting to Report on the Situation

[French News Agency, Paris, 14th] The Political Bureau of the French Communist Party met this morning and decided to demand that a Communist Party member be appointed as Prime Minister. This is the result of the Communist Party's recent victory in the general election. At the same time, the Central Committee of the Socialist Party is scheduled to meet on the 17th, and the Communist Party has decided to contact them and propose the formation of a coalition government. This government will be headed by a Communist Party member and will be a democratic, anti-clerical, and socialized government.

[Associated Press, Paris, 13th] According to today's news, French Prime Minister Bidault has urged that the permanent government of the new Fourth Republic be formed immediately after the first meeting of the parliament on November 28, without waiting for the election of the new president. Bidault's reason for advocating the rapid formation of a permanent cabinet is that many diplomatic and domestic issues urgently need to be resolved and cannot wait for two months. In order to support this proposal with concrete actions, the Bidault cabinet will submit its resignation when the parliament convenes.

[French New News Agency, Paris, 13th] The French cabinet held a meeting this morning, where the interim president and prime minister and foreign minister, Bidault, reported on the international situation, followed by the minister of overseas territories, Moutet, reporting on the situation in Vietnam, and finally by the minister of labor, Croizat, reporting on the issue of Italian immigrants.

[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 13th] People here have different views on the French Communist Party's victory in the French general election, depending on the party they belong to. According to what reporters have learned from contacting some French people, most French people in Vietnam believe that it is better to have more contact with countries such as Britain and the United States since their vitality has not yet recovered after the war, and they do not welcome the Communist Party's victory. Vietnamese people, both official and non-official, unanimously welcome the French Communist Party's victory.

### Draft Regulations for the Free Territory of Trieste The Soviets Proposed 14 Revisions The Foreign Ministers' Meeting Encountered Difficulties Again

[This Newspaper News] San Francisco, 14th Broadcast: Since the four foreign ministers resumed discussions on the Italian Peace Treaty, they have apparently reached a deadlock today. Molotov's proposed 14 minimum revisions to the regulations for the Free Territory of Trieste have been opposed by the United States, Britain, and France, and the Soviet Union has insisted on not giving way. If the four powers cannot reach an agreement on the Trieste issue, the British and American troops will remain stationed in the Trieste area indefinitely, and everything will have to be handled by the Trusteeship Council.

[Associated Press, New York, 13th] Today, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov proposed 14 revisions to the draft regulations for the Free Territory of Trieste and told the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France that these measures are the Soviet Union's minimum conditions for resolving the Trieste issue. The main points of the suggestions are to weaken the powers of the Governor of Trieste. The Soviet Union wants to make this governor a formal head and establish a strong parliament. The United States and Britain opposed the Soviet Union's suggestion that British and American troops should withdraw from this area within a certain period after the signing of the Italian Peace Treaty, stating that this point should be decided by the United Nations. The United States and Britain also firmly opposed the suggestion that Trieste should be governed by the Four Foreign Ministers' Meeting instead of the Security Council before the implementation of the permanent regulations.

### South Africa Proposes Annexing Southwest Africa

Smuts Broadcasts Criticism of the Soviet Union

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 13th] The Union of South Africa today proposed annexing Southwest Africa. General Smuts told the Trusteeship Council that the Union of South Africa refused to accept the trusteeship of Southwest Africa. If the proposal for annexation is not passed, South Africa will continue to govern the former German colony under the League of Nations mandate. The Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, Belarus, Ukraine, Poland, China, and India opposed South Africa's annexation request.

[Reuters, New York, 14th] South African Prime Minister Smuts recently broadcasted that the Soviet Union has two standards, one for itself and one for other small countries such as South Africa. For its own security, the Soviet Union annexed vast territories such as the Kuril Islands without seeking anyone's opinion. However, when South Africa made a request to the United Nations for Southwest Africa for its own security, the Soviet Union expressed opposition. Should the world necessarily acknowledge that the security principles of strong and weak countries should be different?

### American Army and Navy Leaders Discuss Reducing the Defense Budget Respond to Republican Accusations with Concrete Measures

[This Newspaper News] Paris, 14th Broadcast Washington News: White House Secretary Ross announced at a press conference: US Army and Navy leaders will hold a meeting today to discuss the reduction of the defense budget. President's Chief of Staff Leahy, Army Chief of Staff Eisenhower, and Chief of Naval Operations Nimitz will all participate. The government will respond to the Republican accusations against the military expenditure budget with concrete measures. According to informed sources, this is a meeting to reorganize and unify the Army and Navy.

[French News Agency, Washington, 14th] Republican Congressman Cole told the press today that the US Army and Navy budget for the fiscal year beginning in July 1947 will be reduced by 20 to 37 percent. Navy Secretary Forrest intends to reduce the Navy budget from 5 billion US dollars to 4 billion US dollars, and the Army budget will also be reduced from 8 billion US dollars to 5 or 6 billion US dollars.

[French News Agency, Washington, 13th] Republican Senator Knutson said that the Republican Party may revise the defense budget and is currently considering reducing the budget of the Army and Navy by 300 million US dollars. The Republicans believe that the current weapons of war have become obsolete due to the development of the last war, and the main military expenditure in the future will be for experimental research. The strength of the Army and Navy may be reduced, and focus will be placed on atomic armaments and other secret weapons. The Army and Navy are currently keeping silent on this matter.

### American Fleet Will Sail to Antarctica Next Month Engage in Cold-Weather Combat Training The Soviet Union Also Declares It Will Conduct Exercises There

[United Press, Washington, 13th] The United States, knowing that its military exercises in the Arctic region have caused unease in the Soviet Union, has turned to the other end of the earth to conduct cold-weather experiments with warships and aircraft. The Navy Department announced today that it will send a fleet to exercise in the Antarctic to prepare for the US Navy to fight in cold climates in the future. The United States chose Antarctica as the training location for two reasons: one is to alleviate the Soviet Union's concerns about exercises near its territory, and the other is that the remote location of the exercises can ensure the secrecy of the exercises to a considerable extent. The Antarctic exercises will be technically guided by the famous Antarctic explorer Byrd. It is said that the Soviet Union has also announced that it will conduct exercises in Antarctica, but the details are unknown. In addition, a British expedition also arrived in Antarctica two years ago, and some personnel may still be staying there. The British base there is about 1,500 miles from the future base of the US expedition to the Ross Sea. That ground faces New Zealand. Byrd's expedition to Antarctica eight years ago was stationed here. Although he briefly mentioned the question of whether the American expedition would find materials for uranium energy and atomic bombs, he said that this expedition should not be regarded as a uranium competition. The American expedition will have a total of 4,000 people, including about 300 pure scientists, including 25 civilian scientists. According to the Navy authorities, no nuclear physicists are accompanying them. Establishing a permanent or semi-permanent base in Antarctica can accommodate the experiments of flying arrows, which are both safe and secret. Byrd's group is scheduled to board 13 ships early next month, with the Olympus Mountain as the flagship. The aircraft will be carried by the aircraft carrier Philippine Sea, and the submarine fleet will conduct sea measurements.

### The United States Will Establish a Strong Base on the Large Ryukyu Islands

Plans to Assist China in Establishing a Strong Navy

[Central News Agency, Washington, 13th, United Press] The United States plans to use the former Japanese mandated islands to supplement Guam, Pearl Harbor, the Aleutian Islands, and Alaska as strong defensive locations. Among the Marshall, Caroline, and Mariana Islands, only Saipan and Tinian are strategically important in peacetime. After a 28,000-mile journey through the Pacific and China with US military leaders, a United Press reporter stated that, for the long-term defense of the United States, all islands other than the aforementioned islands have been relegated to secondary positions and do not need to be urgently expanded immediately. The Guam base is the most important, so it is planned to be completed first in 1951, making it a base that can supply any American fleet in the Pacific. Army and Navy leaders all believe that the United States must establish a strong base on the large Ryukyu Islands in order to complete the "stabilizing force" in Northeast Asia and the Western Pacific region. The United States does not have a permanent naval base in China, but it will assist the Chinese government in establishing the Qingdao Naval Academy and training 110 Chinese naval officers and 1,100 sailors. The American side believes that a strong Chinese navy can allow the United States to withdraw many warships currently deployed in the Pacific.

[United Press, Cairo, 13th] Thousands of members of the Egyptian Nationalist Party marched in a procession to the Royal Palace today, shouting "Revolution, Revolution," demanding the resignation of the Sadat Cabinet, resulting in two fierce clashes with hundreds of police officers.

Earlier, about 8,000 Nationalist Party members met at the club and demanded "the withdrawal of British troops from Egypt, the resignation of Prime Minister Sadat, and the complete incorporation of the Nile River basin into Egyptian territory."

### British Cabinet Faces Crisis Labor Party Members Criticize Current Diplomacy

[French News Agency, London, 13th] The Standard Evening News recently reported that Prime Minister Attlee announced that 69 Labor Party members recently jointly submitted a motion criticizing the government's foreign policy, and if they do not automatically withdraw it, they will be in danger of being expelled from Parliament. Among these 69 members, 54 had jointly submitted a motion to amend the current foreign policy, advocating a policy that opposes American capitalism and Soviet communism at the same time. The remaining 15 had jointly submitted a motion opposing the implementation of mandatory military service. For this reason, Prime Minister Attlee proposed to prohibit Labor Party members from proposing any motions opposing the government's policies. Unexpectedly, 200 Labor Party members expressed their approval of the Prime Minister's motion. The British Labor Party has faced its most serious crisis since coming to power in July 1945, and this can be seen from this.

### Dutch-Indonesian Negotiations Agreement in Sight

### Seizure of Japanese Foreign Ministry Documents Unexpectedly Discovers Deletions

Prosecutors Say It Is Extremely Important to the Entire Case

[United Press, Tokyo, 14th] At the opening of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East today, the prosecution announced that a copy of a telegram from the former Foreign Minister Togo to the former Ambassador to the United States Nomura, which was found in the Japanese Foreign Ministry archives, was discovered to have been deleted. The telegram was sent on November 30, 1941, four days after the Japanese fleet entered the Pacific in preparation for attacking Pearl Harbor, instructing Nomura to make another verbal negotiation to make the United States accept Japanese demands. One of the most important paragraphs in the original telegram stated: "In carrying out this order, please be cautious and do not cause anything that would cause the negotiations to break down." At that time, the telegram was intercepted by American intelligence personnel and made public during the Pearl Harbor Incident investigation. The original manuscript obtained by the International Tribunal from the Japanese Foreign Ministry archives did not contain this paragraph. Deputy Prosecutor Feichli asked the court to pay attention to the importance of the deleted part and said: "We currently have no evidence to prove who made the deletion, but an investigation is underway. Presiding Judge Webb ordered him to continue the investigation, saying that he was dealing with one of the most important documents in the entire case." The prosecution accused the defendants of attempting to prolong the Washington negotiations in order to cover up their military preparations for attacking Pearl Harbor and Singapore, so the deleted telegram is extremely important to the basis of the prosecution.

### Punishing Aggressive War Criminals International Law Should Be Established

Truman Suggests to the United Nations

### Deputy Secretary of State Clayton's Speech Elucidates American Economic Policy Emphasizes the Importance of the Sino-American Treaty of Commerce

[French News Agency, New York, 13th] Director of the State Department's Economic Bureau Clayton delivered a speech at the National Foreign Trade Convention today, stating that the goal of American foreign economic policy is to expand the world economy in order to lay the foundation for peace. To implement this policy, we must increase the production, distribution, and consumption of goods throughout the world, so that people of all countries in the world can have ample food and clothing and live and work in peace and contentment. To achieve this goal, the American government signed the Sino-American Treaty of Commerce with China on the 4th of this month, and the American government is now formulating a plan to negotiate similar treaties with other governments. Although our foreign economic policy cannot claim to be purely altruistic, there is nothing wrong with protecting our own interests on the one hand and taking into account the rights and interests of other countries on the other hand. In fact, these two must complement each other in any case.

### Japan Reparations Conference to Open at Month's End; Pauley's Final Report; Remaining Ships to Be Considered When Drafting Peace Treaty

[United Press International, Washington, 13th] Edwin Pauley, Special Envoy for Japanese Reparations Issues, today submitted his final report to President Truman, supplementing the preliminary report submitted in the spring. It provides a detailed estimate of Japanese assets available for reparations to the Allied nations. A copy of this final report has also been sent to the State Department and will then be submitted to the Far Eastern Commission as a blueprint for discussions to begin at the end of this month or early next month. China, Britain, Australia, the Netherlands, France, India, the Philippines, and New Zealand have all agreed to participate in the conference, but the Soviet Union remains a question mark. The contents of Pauley's report are currently being kept strictly confidential, but it is understood that not only various military factories and auxiliary military factories but also consumer goods factories are included for allocation as reparations. The United States and Canada have not, at least as of now, made any claims regarding preliminary reparations allocations. The Soviet Union, however, continues to show indifference to the Far Eastern Commission and the United States' separate efforts to resolve the Japanese reparations issue, and is therefore also unlikely to make any claims.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 13th, United Press] A member of the Far Eastern Commission told a United Press reporter that the issue of Japanese commercial ships rebuilding Japan's overseas trade will be one of the last issues considered when drafting the peace treaty. Before the Allied nations engage in any discussion of this issue, they will first determine their reparations claims against Japan, and only then will they consider the use of the remaining Japanese ships, and their final disposition, to help Japan's economic recovery and enable Japan to participate in the trade activities of other maritime nations.

### American Invention; Amphibious Vehicle

### Deadline for Reporting Losses Suffered by the People During the War Extended by One Month; Regulations for Victims to Report Based on Value at Time of Loss; Compensation to Be Converted into Pre-War U.S. Dollars

During the first session of the City Council, a proposal was made: "Negotiate for compensation for losses during the war, provide full relief to the affected people, alleviate public hardship, and comfort public expectations." After a public vote, the proposal was forwarded by the City Government to the Central Government for consideration. The City Government submitted the proposal to the Central Government a month ago. Yesterday, the Executive Yuan's Compensation Committee replied: "The investigation and reporting of people's losses may have omissions. The investigation and reporting period may be extended for one month from the date of this document. However, attention must be paid to preventing false reports. The value of losses reported should be based on the value at the time of the loss. This Committee has made this stipulation to calculate the true value of the loss suffered by the reporter. In the future, when demanding compensation from Japan, the value at the time of the loss will be converted into the U.S. dollar value of July 1947. This type of calculation standard is more convenient." It is understood that, for the sake of accuracy and convenience, the City Government will issue a notice to all districts to assist with registration and investigation. Fearing that citizens may not understand the procedures, it has specially prepared forms, including the Property Loss Report Form, the Direct Property Loss Report Form for Industrial Companies, Firms, and Factories, the Direct Property Loss Report Form for Commercial Companies and Firms, and the Shanghai Population Injury and Death Investigation Form. It is necessary to fill in the name, address, date of loss, lost materials, and value. Sufficient documents should be prepared for review. Report promptly within one month for submission to the Central Government to demand compensation from Japan.

[Another Report] The City Council previously proposed that the Central Government allocate a portion of Japanese reparations and enemy-puppet assets to handle the city's construction projects. However, according to the Executive Yuan's Compensation Committee's reply: "How to compel Japan to pay compensation is currently being planned. As for how the compensation materials will be allocated and distributed in the future, it will be handled by the relevant Central Government departments after jointly formulating a plan."

### American Nationals in Shanghai Must Register Losses with the Municipal Government Immediately

[United Press, Washington, 13th] The State Department today announced that, according to a notice from the Shanghai Municipal Government, American nationals in Shanghai who have suffered loss of life or property from December 8, 1941, to the end of the war are requested to register with the Municipal Government for compensation claims. This includes deaths, injuries, property losses, and losses due to increased business expenses and reduced profits. The amount of compensation requested must be calculated in legal tender. The State Department also announced that this action by the Shanghai Municipal Government does not affect the U.S. authorities' future compensation claims. Furthermore, this action by the Shanghai Municipal Government is simply because the Nanjing government wants to know the estimated losses of American nationals and does not imply immediate payment. Other municipal governments outside of Shanghai are also handling the matter in the same way. Payment of compensation is likely to occur after the signing of a peace treaty with Japan.

### Lady Cripps Arrives in Shanghai; Madame Sun and Others Welcome Her at the Airport; Reception for Chinese and Foreign Reporters This Morning

This morning at 10:00 a.m., Lady Cripps will hold a reception for Chinese and foreign reporters at the Mayor's official residence. In the evening, the Mayor and his wife will host a dinner.

Also, at 4:00 p.m., Chinese and foreign relief organizations will hold a tea party at the American Community Church as a friendly gathering. It is understood that Sir Stafford Cripps' family are all vegetarians and usually like to eat fresh vegetables and abstain from meat. The whole family follows this rule for decades, so the banquet for the distinguished guest will mainly be vegetarian. Tomorrow morning, Lady Cripps and her entourage will visit the Military Medical Office in Jiangwan. In the afternoon, the Shanghai Women's Federation will host a tea party. In the evening, the manager and his wife of the British Swire Group will host a dinner at their private residence on Hongqiao Road, and Lady Cripps will also accept their invitation to spend a quiet early winter weekend in Hongqiao, away from the city.

### Improving Loan Methods; Banning Check Discounting

Banking Society Practical Meeting

The Banking Society held a practical meeting yesterday. Attendees included representatives from the Four Banks and Two Bureaus, the silver industry, and trust companies. Several important cases were discussed: (1) Unifying the sample seals of the industry, all signed in Chinese, with signing staff divided into levels A and B. (2) Suggesting fixed-term loans to supplement the application of commercial promissory notes. This case aims to improve the current loan methods and ban the practice of check discounting. It is currently under further study by the Society. It is said that it has three advantages: (A) Account receivables become negotiable receivables, which are easier to recover and can be endorsed for transfer. (B) It can avoid customers' excuses for shadow accounts. (C) It can curb the practice of issuing checks indiscriminately, and bounced checks can be reduced.

### China Merchants Bureau's New Ship, "Lingge," Arrives in Shanghai

The "Dengyu" ship is currently unloading cargo in the capital. The "Lingge" ship also arrived in Shanghai yesterday, entering the port at 11:10 a.m. and departing again at 4:15 p.m. The main reason is that there is no place to berth in the port, so it is temporarily anchored outside the port. It is also reported that the Bureau previously selected surplus American ships in the Philippines. They have now been coming to Shanghai in succession. Tugboats Nos. 106 and 108 came to Shanghai some days ago. They are now ordered to go to the Philippines to tow iron barges to Shanghai, which are expected to arrive within this month.

### Second Public Sale of Enemy-Puppet Properties; Few Applications to Purchase; No One Cares About Weihai Villas, Etc.

Since the Central Trust Bureau's second public sale of 39 units of enemy-puppet properties began registration, more than half a month has passed. As of yesterday, only more than 20 units have been applied for. For various alleyway houses with leasing disputes, except for one or two alleyways in the Hongkou District where applications have been registered, no one has applied for other alleyways such as the Weihai Villas. This is because no one wants to create unnecessary trouble for themselves. It is understood that the deadline for the second public sale registration may be on the 20th of this month. Because of the original tenants' efforts to fight for their rights, those who want to buy have been deterred, resulting in the fact that the alleyways will not be sold in the second public sale. They are able to continue living there for now and will not be in a panic.

### Housing for Public School Teachers; 1,000 Buildings to Be Built in Both Nanjing and Shanghai; Three Banks and Two Bureaus to Form a Loan Syndicate

In order to help the government solve the housing problem for public school teachers and promote urban construction, the Central Trust Bureau is currently discussing with the China Bank, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank of China, and the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau to jointly form a "Housing Loan Syndicate for Public School Teachers' Housing Sales." The plan is to first build 1,000 houses for public school teachers in Nanjing and Shanghai to alleviate the housing shortage in both places. The initial agreement and the regulations of the Syndicate's Management Committee have been drafted by the Central Trust Bureau and are awaiting consultation with the various banks and bureaus. Once decided, the loan syndicate can be established, and it is hoped that commercial banks can also participate in the cooperation. According to a responsible person from the Central Trust Bureau to a reporter from the Central News Agency: "The housing loan syndicate is expected to be established next month, and construction can also begin in the spring of next year. Pre-orders will be publicly registered in Nanjing and Shanghai. The residential houses and the land will be sold separately, but the purchasers are limited to public school teachers from government agencies. The houses in Shanghai will be built on vacant land belonging to enemy-puppet properties in the Hongkou, Zhabei, Nanshi, and downtown areas. The Central Trust Bureau has also surveyed a portion of the vacant land belonging to enemy-puppet properties in this city and submitted it to the Executive Yuan for approval. It will be purchased for the construction of public school teachers' housing. The cost of housing is divided into five categories. The highest, Grade A, is estimated to cost 40 million yuan including the land. Grade B is 35 million yuan, Grade C is 30 million yuan, Grade D is 20 million yuan, and Grade E is a small house with one floor above and one floor below, costing 10 million yuan. According to the plan proposed by the Central Trust Bureau, the total price of the first phase of construction in Nanjing and Shanghai is limited to 20 billion yuan. Those who make reservations must first pay a deposit of 30% of the total purchase price. The remaining 70% will be paid in equal monthly installments over twelve months from the date of delivery, with a monthly interest rate of 2.5%. Therefore, during the construction period, in addition to pre-collecting 30% of the construction cost from the reservationists, the syndicate must provide loans of approximately 14 billion yuan. If the purchasers need to change the Central Trust Bureau's regulations or add additional installations to the style of the building, they can temporarily apply to the Bureau for approval, and the additional costs will be borne by the purchasers."

### Transportation Company Operating at a Loss; Goods Transported Embezzled

[Our Reporter] Zhang Xiaomei, a female worker at Shenxin No. 7 Factory, No. 7-8, Lane 522, Changyang Road, Hudong, recently had 40 pieces of tin foil stacked in her home. Chen Xiwu, a plainclothes police officer from the Tilanqiao Police Station, learned about the matter and suspected something was amiss. He secretly reported it to Branch Director Zhang the day before yesterday, who immediately ordered Section Chief Ma Zhuyu to send police officers to conduct a strict investigation. It was discovered that the tin foil was purchased from Fuyuan Shen Tin Foil Store in Wuxi and transported by Daxin Company. Because the company did not have enough goods to fill a car, it entrusted the transfer to the Meta Trading and Transportation Company (located in Room 103, Shenzhou Hotel, Zhejiang Road). However, Zhang Jigen, the person in charge of the company, was not good at operating the company and suffered huge losses. He colluded with Cai Ping of Shenxin No. 7 Factory to set up a scam. He had the 40 pieces of tin foil unloaded from the truck and hired streetcars to transport them to Zhang Xiaomei's home for hiding, falsely claiming that they were repayment from a friend. Zhang Jigen went to other places to sell them. Later, Daxin Transportation Company received a telegram from Fuyuan Shen in Wuxi saying that the goods had not arrived. It became suspicious and urgently inquired with Meta about the details, but it was not known where the goods had gone. Now, Cai Ping and the tin foil have been seized by the Tilanqiao Branch.

### German Suspected War Criminals Continued to Be Tried Yesterday; Japanese Liaison Officer Takashima Testified; Ohlhaver Smiled Bitterly Frequently; Shen Ke and Others' Request for Release Was Not Approved

[Our Reporter] The American Military Tribunal continued to try the remaining 21 German suspected war criminals, including Ohlhaver, at 8:00 a.m. yesterday, after six people including Shen Ke were acquitted the day before yesterday.

After the court session began, Lawyer Yao Zhaodi, Shen Ke's defense lawyer, argued that Shen Ke had already been acquitted and should not be detained any longer. He stood up and asked the court to release him immediately. The defense lawyers for the rest of the defendants, including Gerisch, Otto, Hormann, Stohrer, and Randow, also made the same request one after another. Presiding Judge Colonel Myron and others announced that they would adjourn the court for deliberation. After fifteen minutes, the court reconvened, but the lawyers' request was not granted.

Throughout the morning, Takashima, the former Japanese military liaison officer with the Ohlhaver Bureau in Shanghai, testified. Takashima testified that the Japanese military had a relationship with the Ohlhaver Bureau since March 1943. The Bureau provided information on the international situation and military affairs and intercepted United Nations telegrams. After the news of Germany's surrender in August 1945, the Japanese military authorities ordered Ohlhaver to dissolve its organization. The Japanese military took over all the Bureau's assets, and the personnel in the Bureau were free to continue serving the Japanese side or not. Takashima recalled the situation when he accompanied his superior to meet with Ohlhaver at that time vividly. Ohlhaver, who was listening attentively on the defendant's bench, smiled bitterly frequently upon hearing this. Takashima also said that the Japanese side gave the Ohlhaver Bureau 130 million yuan in counterfeit money as dissolution fees.

### Enemy-Puppet Properties Used for Offices to Be Sold as State Treasury Properties

The Municipal Government Has Received Instructions from the Executive Yuan

The Executive Yuan has stipulated a uniform method for government agencies that borrow enemy-puppet properties for office use. The enemy-puppet property management bureau will sell them to the Ministry of Finance as state treasury properties, and they will still be leased by the Central Trust Bureau.

It is reported that those summoned this time include Li Lihua, Mei Xi, Chen Yanyan, Zhang Shankun, Yue Feng, Huang Tianyou, Zhou Shimu, and more than ten others. The majority are key personnel from the film "The Remorse of Spring River."

### Board Meeting of the Drama and Film Association; Statement Issued Regarding the Prosecution of Traitors

Recently, regarding the High Procuratorate's summons of film and drama personnel suspected of collaborating with the enemy, there has been much speculation. The Drama and Film Association held a board meeting on the 7th of this month. Attendees included Yu Wen, Luo Xuelian, Gu Zhongyi, Zhou Xinfang, Zhang Junxiang, Shi Dongshan, Fei Mu (represented by Shi), Meng Junmou, Ge Yihong, Wu Renzhi, Zhou Boxun, Xiong Fuxi, Cai Chusheng (represented by Meng), Wu Yonggang, Mei Lanfang (represented by Zhou Xinfang), Ying Yunwei, Ouyang Yuqian, Wu Zuguang, Feng Zi, Zheng Junli, Li Jianwu, Zhang Che, and over twenty others. After discussion, the meeting decided to issue the following statement: (1) The Association previously conducted public opinion surveys and consulted legal experts to investigate film and drama personnel suspected of collaborating with the enemy. After thorough research, it was decided to issue moral condemnations against these individuals. The list of individuals summoned by the High Procuratorate, as reported by several newspapers in this city, was mistakenly reported to have been made by the Association, and a statement should be issued to clarify responsibility. (2) The Association believes that this issue should be handled with clarity, recognizing the severity and importance of the matter, and with speed and caution. It hopes that national law enforcement agencies will prioritize the future of the entire film and drama industry and avoid negatively impacting the burgeoning revival of domestic film production.

### Impersonating the Chief of Military Law; Twice Defrauding People of Valuables; Japanese Victims Seek Information; Li Chunzhen Finally Arrested

[Our Dispatch] The Inspection Department of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters recently apprehended Li Chunzhen (age 35), a Chinese expatriate who had studied in Japan, in a nightclub in Hongkou for impersonating the Chief of Military Law of the department. The suspect had previously, in the middle of last month, using the aforementioned title, defrauded over 300 Japanese expatriates who had evacuated from Beijing to Shanghai of five million legal tender. At the time, their luggage exceeded the regulations of our authorities, and fearing confiscation, they privately hired civilian ships to smuggle the excess luggage to Shanghai in advance. The Garrison Headquarters learned of this and detained the ship upon arrival. The suspect then claimed to be the Chief of Military Law of the Garrison Headquarters and contacted Noshita, the representative of the Japanese expatriates, stating that if five million yuan was given as lobbying expenses, it could be returned within ten days. After the payment was made, there was no further news. Noshita then inquired with the Garrison Headquarters and realized that he had been deceived. Unexpectedly, earlier this month, the suspect, again using the same title, defrauded Kuwahara, another Japanese expatriate, of a cotton cloth warehouse receipt stored at the Jin City Bank. He then altered the name on the receipt and sold it for twenty million yuan. After being arrested, Li Chunzhen confessed to the aforementioned crimes. The Inspection Department has now transferred him to the Military Law Department for legal proceedings.

### Military Police Stationed at Tram Terminals; Passengers Should Not Compete for Priority

[Our Dispatch] Order at tram stops has always been extremely chaotic, with passengers competing to be the first to board and military police forcing their way on, leading to frequent disputes. To guide passengers to obey order, the authorities have dispatched three military police officers to the terminal stations of Tilanqiao, Yangjingbang, and Jing'an Temple, starting yesterday. They are stationed there throughout the day to advise passengers to line up and board the tram in an orderly manner. Even military and police personnel are not exempt. The military police strictly enforce the rules, and those who take "return trams" in order to secure a seat are also ordered to disembark and join the back of the line. Therefore, at the end of the workday yesterday, the lines at Yangjingbang were quite orderly.

### Among Shanghai's Four Million Residents, Three Thousand Suffer from Leprosy; The China Leprosy Association Launches a Fundraising Campaign for 200 Million

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] Leprosy... The mere mention of this name conjures up a terrifying image: swollen faces, enlarged ears, no eyebrows. Another type of neurological leprosy patient... Leprosy is the most dreadful of all diseases. It disfigures patients and subjects them to social rejection and contempt. The physical suffering is endless, and the mental persecution is even more relentless.

Christianity is the only religion in the world that shows compassion for leprosy patients. The story of Jesus healing lepers is well known. The "China Leprosy Relief Association" is dedicated to eradicating leprosy based on Christian humanitarian principles.

Across China, there are nearly one million leprosy patients, with the highest concentrations in the southern and southwestern provinces. This may be due to the hot climate and unsanitary living conditions. According to reliable estimates, there are approximately three thousand leprosy patients scattered among Shanghai's four million residents. Among them are beggars, vendors, department store employees, master chefs, street performers, and shoestore owners. Therefore, we are constantly at risk of coming into contact with leprosy patients. This is extremely dangerous.

Some European and American countries have leprosy laws, and the police have the authority to arrest leprosy patients and send them to leprosy asylums for compulsory treatment because these individuals pose a threat to public safety. However, this is not the case in China, where leprosy patients have complete freedom and are not subject to any interference.

Leprosy is now a curable disease, but first, it is necessary to isolate patients from society for public safety. Therefore, the China Leprosy Relief Association has two main goals: to provide relief to leprosy patients and to protect public safety.

The "China Leprosy Relief Association" was established in 1926. It has established leprosy hospitals in Hainan Island, Hunan, Guangdong, and Jiangxi to provide scientific treatment to patients. In various parts of South China, due to public prejudice, many leprosy hospitals are like prisons, treating patients worse than animals. There have even been cases of leprosy patients being shot.

As for the Shanghai branch of the China Leprosy Relief Association, it purchased one hundred acres of land in Dachang in 1935 and built seventeen houses, becoming the largest leprosy asylum in the country. Unfortunately, after the outbreak of war, the association's headquarters were destroyed by enemy forces and are no longer usable. It is now restricted to a corner of Bailinan Road.

Seventh Fundraising Campaign to Open Today

To actively promote leprosy relief work, the association has launched its seventh fundraising campaign, with Mayor Wu serving as the honorary director-general. The opening ceremony is scheduled for 4:00 PM today at the Kangle Restaurant.

According to the association's director-general, Du Zhijian, who spoke to reporters, it will cost 200 million yuan to repair the buildings in Dachang and 100 million yuan to replenish various facilities, totaling 300 million yuan. One hundred million yuan has already been secured, and the target for this fundraising campaign is 200 million yuan in national currency.

Citizens of Shanghai, for the sake of those suffering leprosy patients and for the safety of society, please donate generously.

### Pre-Pacific War Installment Savings Account, 800-Fold Repayment Case; Juxingcheng Bank Appeals in Disagreement

The High Court Encourages Both Parties to Attempt Reconciliation; Expresses Reluctance to Set a Precedent

[Our Dispatch] The issue of repaying pre-war debts has recently attracted great public attention and has repeatedly led to disputes. Yesterday, the Fifth Civil Division of the High Court heard another appeal case concerning a five-year installment savings account at Juxingcheng Bank, where the lower court ruled that repayment should be calculated at 800 times the original amount. The plaintiffs, Luo Youyuan and the Lu Kun brothers, deposited special installment savings with Juxingcheng Bank on September 28, 1938, and December 14, 1938, respectively, with a term of five years, both expiring in May 1942. Lu Yu's account had a balance of 2,311.43 yuan, and Lu Kun's account had a balance of 2,185.03 yuan. The Lu brothers engaged a lawyer on June 28 of this year to inquire with Juxingcheng Bank, but received no response. They then filed a lawsuit in the lower court in August, requesting repayment at 1,000 times the original amount. The lower court concluded in mid-September, ruling that the depreciation of currency and the increase in the cost of living were well-known facts. If debtors were to repay previous deposits at the original amount, it would be unfair, and it was reasonable and legal for creditors to request increased payment. However, the total deposits were made in installments, with 40% deposited in 1941 and 1942. Therefore, the court considered the circumstances of both parties and determined that repayment should be calculated at 800 times the original amount, awarding Lu Yu 1,849,144 legal tender and Lu Kun 1,748,024 legal tender, both with monthly interest of 9% from the date of filing the lawsuit until the date of execution. The remainder of the plaintiffs' claims was dismissed, and the defendant was responsible for the litigation costs.

After receiving the lower court's judgment on September 19, the defendant, Juxingcheng Bank, argued that installment savings accounts differed from other fixed-term deposits. Banks conducting savings business are subject to strict restrictions on capital utilization under the Savings Bank Law. They are required to deposit one-quarter of the total amount as government bonds in a special vault established by the Central Bank as collateral for repaying savings deposits. Other methods of utilization are limited to low-profit, high-security policies. During the Anti-Japanese War, Shanghai was occupied by the enemy and puppet regime, and the bank's investment and utilization scope became even more restricted, incomparable to those engaging in profiteering. Therefore, it could not bear the 800-fold amount and immediately appealed to the High Court. The hearing took place at 3:00 PM yesterday. The appellant, Juxingcheng Bank's attorney Yao Zhaodi, and the appellee's attorney, Wang Boxian, were both present. After Judge Cheng Ruikun questioned the case, he encouraged both parties to attempt reconciliation, stating that the court was unwilling to set a precedent. If reconciliation failed, the court would collect relevant information and make a decision after careful consideration. He also hoped that both parties would collect statistical materials to assist the court's judgment. The case was adjourned for further hearing.

### Another Savings Deposit Case; 1,000-Fold Repayment; Also Undecided

Furthermore, Chen Jilin, a citizen, deposited 2,000 legal tender with the Four Banks Savings Association on May 6, 1940, for a five-year term. Upon maturity on May 6 of last year, Chen filed a lawsuit with the court, arguing that according to Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Litigation After Recovery and Interpretation No. 3018 of the Judicial Yuan, he requested an increase in payment of 3,000 times the original amount. The lower court ruled that the defendant, the Four Banks Savings Association, should increase the payment by 1,000 times. However, the Four Banks Savings Association, because the Ministry of Finance had already repaid pre-war government bonds at their original value and the Central Savings Association was settling old savings deposits based on the original value, appealed to the High Court. Yesterday's hearing remained unresolved and was adjourned for further hearing.

### Cold Front Approaches; Cold Weather to Continue Today and Tomorrow

[Our Dispatch] Yesterday, the weather in the city was even colder than the previous day, with overcast skies and biting winds, resembling the depths of winter. The highest temperature for the day was 57.6 degrees Fahrenheit, and the lowest was 48.8 degrees Fahrenheit. According to the Meteorological Observatory, this Siberian cold front has a pressure of 780 cm, so the cold air it contains is extremely strong. The cold front is divided into two streams. One is currently moving from North China towards Central and South China, with its outposts already extending to Taiwan. The other is moving from the northwest towards the southwest, so the entire country is under the influence of the cold front. The city will continue to experience cold weather today and tomorrow, with overcast skies, fog, and possibly light rain. After the cold front passes, the weather may become more stable. The report from the Shanghai Meteorological Observatory is recorded below:

The center of the Siberian anticyclone is in northwestern China, covering the entire country, the nine eastern provinces, Korea, and Japan. The tropical low pressure area is near Yap Island in the East Sea, Ryukyu Islands, and the northern South China Sea.

Weather forecast: Yellow Sea, cloudy and cold, strong northerly to northeasterly winds, high waves.

Central China, cloudy, localized rain or fog, light haze, brisk northerly to northeasterly winds.

Shanghai, cloudy, sometimes overcast, brisk northerly to northeasterly winds, light haze.

East Sea, cloudy, rain in the south, light haze, strong northerly to northeasterly winds, high waves. The Taiwan Strait is experiencing turbulent waves.

Temperature on the 14th: Highest 57.6 degrees, lowest 48.8 degrees.

### China National Aviation Corporation Increases Shanghai-Fuzhou-Taiwan Route

Trial Flight to Jinhua is Untrue

To expand coastal air transport, China National Aviation Corporation recently decided to add the Shanghai-Fuzhou-Taiwan route, with round trips scheduled for two days. The first day would be from Shanghai to Fuzhou via Xiamen, and the second day would be from Fuzhou to Taiwan and back to Shanghai. This route is expected to open in the near future, with fares remaining the same. The company's flight schedules on various routes will be partially changed in the coming weeks. The person in charge of the company's business department denied reports that the company was conducting a trial flight to Jinhua.

### Yuan Ludeng Case Remanded for Retrial; Claims He Acted Solely According to His Conscience; Over 3,000 Businesses Jointly Provide Testimonials; Six Witnesses All Claim to Have Been Rescued by the Defendant

[Our Dispatch] The Yuan Ludeng case, involving charges of treason, was previously sentenced to life imprisonment by the Shanghai High Court on May 31. The defendant disagreed with the verdict and appealed to the Supreme Court for a retrial. The Supreme Court ruled that the original trial did not fully investigate evidence favorable to the defendant and hastily sentenced him, which was inappropriate. Therefore, it was remanded for retrial. The High Court originally scheduled a hearing for this morning, but it was postponed to 2:30 PM due to unforeseen circumstances. The questioning concluded at 4:15 PM. Because further investigation of evidence was required, the case was adjourned for further hearing, and the defendant was returned to custody.

The case was presided over yesterday by Judge Qiu Huanrong, assisted by Clerk Tang Quan. The questioning focused on the defendant's role as Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Puppet Shanghai Baobao (Neighborhood) Self-Government and Chairman of the Puppet Rice Control Association. Yuan, dressed in a blue gown, black socks, and black shoes, with black tortoiseshell-rimmed glasses, testified that on February 14, 1942, bomb incidents occurred in six districts of the city, and all districts were sealed off. At the time, the defendant served as a Chinese Director of the Shanghai Municipal Council and used his position in the business community to mediate. The Japanese side made his appointment as Chairman of the Baojia Committee a condition for lifting the blockade. At the time, he thought that it could not be wrong to save people, so he stepped forward. He handled the matter for less than three months and then handed it over to the police bureau. His appointment as Chairman of the Puppet Rice Control Association was also to maintain Shanghai's food supply and distribute rice based on household registrations. In May 1944, the household rice ration was interrupted, and on May 28, he claimed illness and entered the Hongqiao Sanatorium to resign. Only after his resignation was approved did he leave the hospital, he said. The court then questioned the defendant about his pro-enemy statements published in the Puppet New China Daily and other publications. Yuan denied all of them. He also said, "I still have integrity. I will never deny what I have said." He also said, "I was once kidnapped to Hongkou by the Japanese. If they had killed me then, I would have become famous. I have no political ideology, and I don't understand the law. I am a Christian, and all my motives are to save people and seek fairness. Ask He Dehui, he knows everything about my actions in Shanghai and even my private life."

Yu Bingjian and Others Testify

The court then proceeded to question the witnesses presented by the defendant. Huang Hanyuan, former special commissioner of the Relief Committee for Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, Yu Bingjian, current director of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, Mao Geyuan, former member of the Central Relief Committee, Shao Xiushan, a match merchant, Zheng Wuchang, a painter, and Wu Jingbo, a teacher, all testified that they had been arrested by the enemy military police and rescued by the defendant. The defendant's defense attorney, Jiang Yiping, then presented Yuan's record book of entering the Hongqiao Sanatorium in May 1944 to resign as Chairman of the Puppet Rice Control Association (because the government had issued an order to reduce the sentences of those who had left their puppet positions before June 1944). He also presented abstracts of over 2,000 official letters from the Puppet Rice Control Association and a certificate signed jointly by over 3,000 businesses in the city on behalf of the defendant, requesting the court to consider the environment in Shanghai at the time and the defendant's motives for participating in the Puppet Baojia Association and the Puppet Rice Control Association. Attorney Jiang requested that the presiding judge randomly select one or two of these thousands of businesses, all of whom could testify on behalf of the defendant. Attorney Jiang also requested that the court summon Wen Lantao, Lin Kanghou, Tang Shoumin, Chen Guoquan, and Zhou Chunyu, who were in custody, to investigate the situation of the Puppet Rice Control Association.

Request to Extend the Trial Period

He also stated: Tang Shoumin was first sentenced to life imprisonment, followed by Yuan Ludeng also being sentenced to life imprisonment. Then Li Ze was sentenced to three years, Lin Kanghou was sentenced to six years, and Wen Lantao was sentenced to eight years. These five cases are interconnected and have a causal relationship. Because the presiding judge had sentenced one case in that way, he seemed compelled to do the same for the subsequent cases. Therefore, he was subject to many restrictions. This retrial of the Yuan case is to seek the spirit of the rule of law and uphold justice. He requested that the court extend the trial period so that the other cases could be remanded for retrial and judged at the same time, in order to avoid being constrained. On the other hand, the defense team could also have ample time to collect evidence. The court only replied that it would give them time to collect favorable evidence. It then asked the defendant if he had anything to say. Yuan replied: "In my life, I would rather harm myself to benefit others and suffer myself to save others. Please understand this point." At this point, the court adjourned the hearing and adjourned. The defendant briefly spoke with his family members before being returned to Zhonghe.

The Supreme Court's retrial decision for the Yuan case is recorded below:

Supreme Court Retrial Decision

Original text of the Supreme Court retrial decision: "In this case, the original judgment held that the defendant was the General Manager of Ning Shao Shipping Company and had served as a Chinese Director of the former Shanghai Municipal Council for many years. After Shanghai fell, he continued to serve as a Chinese Director and Chairman of the Shanghai Puppet City Chamber of Commerce. In September 1943, the Puppet Nanjing Government's Executive Yuan and the enemy jointly organized the Rice Control Association, with the defendant serving as Chairman and as a member of the Nanjing Puppet Price Control Review Committee, purchasing military rice for the enemy and supplying military needs, until he resigned at the end of June 1944. In February 1942, the Public Concession was bombed by patriots, causing unrest among the enemy. The Concession Center District was divided into six districts and sealed off. The defendant used enemy puppet power to organize Baojia (Neighborhood Watch), serving as Chairman of the Preparatory Committee, clearing household registrations by the Puppet Police Department in two days, hoping to exclude patriotic elements. He also served as a member of the Puppet New National Sports Association, etc. After a thorough review of the entire case by this court, the Rice Control Association was composed of both Chinese and Japanese members. The rice ration was aimed at Chinese and Japanese military rice. There are Shangtong Association publications and the defendant's admission that the association had five Japanese members, six Chinese members, and two deputy chairmen, one being Chen Guoquan and the other being the Japanese representative Zhi Yuan Xian Cilang, which can be confirmed. After the defendant took office as Chairman of the Association, his daily statements stated, "At present, the Greater East Asia War is developing vigorously. Sufficient food and soldiers are important conditions for establishing and protecting the country, and it is closely related to the survival and honor of the future of Greater East Asia. This Association is entrusted by the 'Central Government' and is supported by the people of the whole country, and is responsible for maintaining the people's food supply," as evidenced by the defendant's speeches in many places published in the New China Daily and the Puppet Shenbao. His appointment as Chairman of the Puppet Baojia Preparatory Committee was due to the bombing incident in the Public Concession, which was ordered by the enemy to resolve it. However, if the original judgment has already determined that the defendant committed the above offenses, then his purchase of military rice for the enemy can be considered to be included in his concept of conspiring with the enemy to resist his own country, without the need to independently convict him. The original judgment held that the defendant should be convicted of Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Regulations on Punishing Traitors, as well as Article 5 and Article 3 of the same article, and that the lighter crime of conspiring with the enemy to purchase military rice should be announced in the main text, which is inappropriate. Moreover, the defendant made his best efforts to rescue patriotic elements from danger, and the witnesses were not summoned, etc., so it should be remanded for retrial."

### Two Suspects in the Sun Tianchang Case Interrogated Yesterday

The Korean Sun Tianchangzhi was previously accused of manufacturing military firearms for the enemy. After investigation by the High Procuratorate, he has been transferred to a military court for trial on war crime charges. However, during the investigation of the Sun case, the High Procuratorate believed that Hu Chenggen, the foreman of the Precision Machinery Art Society opened by Sun Tianchangzhi, and Xu Tianxi, the accountant, had been entrusted by the enemy military department since the outbreak of the Pacific War to manage the main branch of the British-owned Motoli Qin Store and manufacture flamethrowers, bayonets, and repair artillery and small tanks for the enemy navy. Xu and Hu were both working with Sun. In 1941, Hu and Sun Tianchangzhi went to Nanzhou at the invitation of the Japanese military to estimate the repair costs of the munitions factory and military machinery for the enemy. Xu Tianxi was in charge of managing confidential matters for Sun Tianchangzhi, personally checking, receiving, and transporting all military supplies and manufactured goods sent by the military department. Therefore, these two individuals also had traitorous crimes. After being legally indicted, the High Court held a court investigation yesterday morning. The testimonies of the two were evasive and they tried to shift responsibility. As the case still requires investigation, it should be adjourned for further hearing.

### Shen Siliang to be Tried This Afternoon

[Another News] The case of Shen Siliang, former president of St. John's University, suspected of being a traitor, will be heard in court by the High Court at 2:30 PM this afternoon, after a public prosecution was brought by the High Procuratorate.

### A Chinese National Colluding with the Enemy: Zhang Yichang's Case Concludes; White Russian Intelligence Agent Sentenced; Xue Jianqiu's Testimony Remains Unchanged

[Report from Our Newspaper] Wuer Taolehefu, the secretary of the White Russian Emigrant Association in this city, was accused of serving as an intelligence agent for the enemy's wireless station on Jing'an Temple Road. After a trial by the High Court, he was sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment yesterday morning. Another defendant, Sun Renmao, a laborer accused of building roads for the enemy, was acquitted because his actions were deemed insufficient to constitute the crime of treason.

Zhang Yichang, 37 years old, from Fuzhou, had been doing business in Manila. He was accused of being ordered by the enemy in March of the 33rd year of the Republic (1944) to investigate sacks and automobile parts in Manila. In June of the same year, he became an intelligence agent for the enemy's naval intelligence department, spying on overseas Chinese information. He was issued credentials by the enemy's intelligence chief, Aoyama, and his monthly salary increased from 500 to 3,000 Philippine pesos. He also purchased scrap iron and privately sold cigarettes for the enemy army, repeatedly reaping substantial profits. He was repatriated to Shanghai by the Philippine government, where he was detained by the city's police bureau. The defendant testified in court yesterday that he was forced to go from Shanghai. However, he denied serving as an intelligence agent. The case is scheduled for sentencing on the morning of the 21st of this month. The case of Wu Yipeng, the secretary of the puppet Suzhou Maintenance Association, was also concluded yesterday and is scheduled for sentencing on the same day.

The case of Xue Jianqiu, a translator for the enemy's Mei Agency in Zhuji County, was heard in the second instance yesterday morning. In addition to serving as a translator for the Mei Agency, he was also accused of being the manager of the enemy's Southeast Company and establishing the Yongming Company on his own to search for and purchase timber, oil, and other items for the enemy. Under the pretext of losing Sugimoto, he led enemy and puppet troops to loot Gengniu properties in Shaojiang, Dalian, Changtai, Changhe, Changyi, and other villages, burned down more than ten houses, beat to death a rural woman named Shou Chen, and injured more than ten people, including Shou Yongsui. During the initial trial, the defendant admitted to serving as a translator for the enemy's Mei Agency, but claimed he participated on the orders of Bi Gaokui of the Military Statistics Bureau. He vehemently denied leading enemy and puppet troops to loot the villages. When the court session opened yesterday, the defendant's testimony remained similar to the above. Bi Gaokui, who was summoned to testify, did not arrive due to other commitments, providing a letter of attestation instead. The court ordered a postponement for further questioning.

### Tap Water Retail: Designated Agents Supply Civilian Areas

In order to reduce epidemics next year, the Municipal Health Bureau has formulated a plan to improve the drinking water in the city's civilian areas. It has decided to install main tap water pipes and connecting branch pipes in designated areas to benefit civilians. The tap water company has been installing 41 such pipes in various locations: nine in the North District, five in the Yimiao District, nine in the North Station area, nine in the Hongkou District, and nine in the South Shanghai District. Following the Public Works Bureau's regulations for retailing tap water, the residences of Baojia chiefs or reputable merchants will be provided with free tap installation and appointed as water selling agents to retail water at prices based on the cost of tap water. The installation locations and agents have been surveyed and designated. The management of water sales will be transferred to the Public Works Bureau. It is expected that the improvement of drinking water in these areas will improve sanitary conditions.

### Social Services: Reader Consultation

Legal Questions

(1) Seeking Compromise

Tang Shuiming asks: A, currently fourteen years old, was betrothed to B at the age of nineteen by his parents. Although A himself did not agree, he did not object. However, a month before the engagement, B attempted suicide by poisoning, stating that it was because B was dissatisfied with the marriage. Subsequently, at the invitation of B's parents and B himself, A directly met with B and explained the process and motivation behind the suicide. It was then learned that B had another boyfriend with whom she had exchanged vows. She was about to be engaged to A, so she felt conflicted and resorted to this tactic. A sought to compromise and agreed to the engagement with B, and they later cohabited. However, the two's personalities were incompatible, and disagreements arose frequently. Now, there are several questions to ask for answers: (1) If A files for divorce from B solely on the grounds of emotional discord and mental damage, will it be valid? (2) As A is the initiator of the divorce but is not married, is there an obligation to pay B living expenses? (3) If B commits suicide after A files for divorce, will A have any legal responsibility?

[Answer by Lawyer Zhu Yakui] (1) Divorce should be based on the reasons listed in Article 1052 of the Civil Code, and cannot be based on vague emotional discord or mental damage. Since A and B are not married, their relationship can only be called cohabitation; (2) According to Article 1057 of the Civil Code, if one spouse is in financial difficulty due to divorce, the other party should provide appropriate alimony even if they are not at fault; (3) If there is no fact or action of threatening suicide, one should not be held responsible.

(2) Voluntary Divorce

Lu Yiyan asks: I work in the education field and have a good reputation in this area. I have a wife and daughter in my hometown. Because I am alone away from home, it is inconvenient, so over the years, I have repeatedly returned to my hometown to bring my family to Shanghai, but they have always refused. When asked why, there is no substantial reason, only stubbornness. Question: (1) According to legal regulations, is a woman obligated to live with her husband after she is married? (2) The two sides have not been in contact for several years and are currently at a standstill. Recently, friends from my hometown mentioned that the other party's behavior is quite frivolous. In order to protect the other party's future and my reputation, I must resolve this quickly. If both parties voluntarily divorce, am I obligated to be responsible for the other party's living expenses? (3) Will my remarriage after the divorce conflict with the law?

[Lawyer Zhu Yakui] (1) Husband and wife naturally have the obligation to live together; (2) If both husband and wife are willing to divorce, they may stipulate the conditions of the divorce themselves. (3) Remarriage is possible and does not conflict with the law.

### Cooking Oil Continues to Rise: Influenced by Visiting Merchants; Distribution is Expected to Get Back on Track After Implementation; Social Affairs Bureau Orders Merchants to Sell Quickly

[Report from Our Newspaper] The oil market continued to rise yesterday. Our reporter visited Mayor Wu to inquire about future policies for cooking oil in the city. He said: Starting next week, the city will regularly have 36,000 dan of cooking oil per month, allocated to various cooking oil retail stores for sale at a negotiated price. The Chinese Cooking Oil Company and the Chinese Vegetable Oil Factory will each be responsible for 10,000 dan. The remaining 16,000 dan will be borne by nine privately-run oil mills. (However, before the private factories return to normal production, they will initially bear 12,000 dan. Efforts will continue to increase production of the remaining 4,000 dan.) The fluctuations in cooking oil prices this week are purely caused by Shanghai merchants from other areas who are inflating the prices of oil from those areas. The cost of oil from other areas is higher, so the asking price is higher than the negotiated price for locally-produced cooking oil. However, the cost of cooking oil from other areas is not within our jurisdiction. In addition, as the private factories have just begun to resume normal oil pressing this week, the distribution of oil is not yet sufficient, and some retail stores may have experienced shortages. However, starting next week, as both national and private oil factories resume normal distribution, the cooking oil retail stores will be able to sell regularly at negotiated prices, so citizens can rest assured. Furthermore, any retailers who resell the allocated oil for profit will be severely punished without leniency if discovered.

According to news from the retail oil industry: the industry registered cooking oil retail merchants yesterday, and more than 400 have come to register. The city's sauce, wine, and sauce garden industries also applied to participate in the distribution of cooking oil yesterday. It is said that the retail merchants' association has, in principle, approved the request but requires them to complete the membership procedures first.

Yesterday, Qingdao raw oil reached 140,000 yuan. However, most of this was the asking price of Qingdao merchants stationed in Shanghai, and the goods were all in the hands of the merchants, so retailers said they had no control. However, at such a high price, transactions were extremely rare. It is said that the Social Affairs Bureau still ordered the merchants to sell quickly. Furthermore, the cost of Qingdao raw oil is currently no more than 120,000 yuan. Therefore, the high price will definitely not last long.

Oil Loans Generally Decided: Manufacturers Hope for Increase

The cooking oil market has not yet stabilized. To thoroughly suppress oil prices, Mayor Wu announced that the city bank would loan 500 million yuan as capital for private oil factories to purchase raw materials. The city bank has already drafted measures. The amount of capital required by each factory will be determined by the oil industry association based on the size of each factory's production capacity. The loans will be for three to six months, with an interest rate of 5%, and an audit committee will be established to make the final decision on each factory's loan. The audit committee will be jointly organized by the city government, the oil industry association, and the city bank, and representatives will be invited from the city council to participate. It is said that the committee may be established within the next week, and the loans will begin to be processed. Currently, raw material prices for cooking oil are rising. Sesame is 45,000 yuan per dan, and soybeans are 28,000 yuan per dan. If only 10,000 dan of sesame are purchased, only 4,000 dan of oil can be produced. If 20,000 dan of soybeans are purchased, only 2,000 dan of oil can be produced. Therefore, the amount of 500 million is not sufficient. Private manufacturers hope that Mayor Wu will increase the amount of the loan. It is said that 2 billion would be enough to operate according to actual needs.

### Western Merchants Still Have Some Concerns: Public Bonds Fall Moderately

Public bonds are still being purchased on behalf of Western merchants by Room 333, which is providing some support in the midst of a market-selling trend. The downward trend has moderated. Unified C opened at 1,350 yuan in the morning, dropping as low as 1,260 yuan before buying pressure emerged, rebounding to 1,420 yuan, and finally hovering around 1,400. As a result, it fell 40 yuan compared to the previous close. A, B, and D each fell 30 yuan, and Unified E fell 100 yuan.

### Spot Yarn Continues to Rise: Dragon Head Cloth Asks 84,000

[Report from Our Newspaper] The yarn market remained stagnant yesterday. 20-count yarn was in demand but unavailable, and prices were particularly chaotic. Generally, it was 20,000 to 30,000 higher. 42-count rose by 100,000, and 16-count remained sluggish. Visiting merchants intended to collect 32-count fine yarn, but the base was extremely scarce. Only Qingdao goods with the Silver Moon brand were brought by northern merchants, with a slight supply of spot goods for sale. The price was about 50,000 to 70,000 higher than last month. Because they already have allocations, practical manufacturers are trading less and less each day. In addition to supplying the goods allocated by the Spinning Management Committee, yarn mills are not selling on the market, so the market is very quiet. The cloth market was flat yesterday morning. In the morning, Fangjian only released the Dragon Head type. The visiting merchants had been watching the market the previous day, but then bought it yesterday afternoon. Dragon Head spot goods are asking 84,000 yuan, and 3A Rainbow Ball is 82,000 yuan. The price of colored cloth has also increased by 3,000 yuan due to the increase in the price of gray cloth and dyes.

### Dye Imports Lacking: Sales Also Very Sluggish

[Report from Our Newspaper] Currently, the city's supply of dyes mostly comes from German Defu dyes distributed by the Enemy Property Administration Bureau. Very few British and American goods are imported. Merchants who specialize in sourcing goods from Hong Kong have very few results. The explanation from business people is that the dye industry was converted to military industry during the war. The major powers have not resumed dye industry due to the tense international situation, so imports are extremely scarce. Some even speculate that the supply will not be sufficient within five years. There are about 180 dye merchants in the city. Their current business is not very prosperous because the dye, silk, and cotton cloth industries are interdependent. The sales can only be expanded if the latter two industries are developed and prosperous. Now that the silk and cloth industries are both sluggish, the demand has naturally declined.

### After Delivery Begins: The Situation is Serious, and People are Apathetic; Chinese Stocks Continue to Decline

Yesterday, Chinese stocks continued to be difficult to rally due to the serious situation and people's apathy. Except for Xinyihe opening flat, the rest opened slightly lower. After the opening, short sellers covered, and 176 and others also advanced. Buying sentiment suddenly increased, and each stock rebounded above the previous close before many sellers emerged. The situation turned sideways. After 11 o'clock, the situation suddenly turned prosperous again. However, most brokers took the opportunity to sell again and adopted a wait-and-see policy. New buying disappeared, and near noon, floating sellers were triggered to sell, and each stock fell again. Except for the three small hot stocks, the other three hot stocks reappeared at low prices. It stabilized slightly near the close. As a result, compared to the previous close, the hot stocks Yongsha, Meiya, Xinyihe, Jingfu, and Xinguang were each down 2-3%. Qinxing fell very little. The cold stocks Datong Cement rose slightly, and Wuhe and Rongfeng were flat. The rest fell slightly to a half or more. In the afternoon, delivery was implemented, and the market was slightly hidden. However, short sellers took the opportunity to pressure Yongsha during the delivery. Therefore, the spot market was even more sluggish due to the lack of profit-making opportunities. This was beyond the expectations of the general public and stock exchange officials. Some stocks had no listed price. Qinxing, which usually considered itself a small hot stock, also announced that no transactions had been made. The situation was even more tired in the middle of the day, and the foot was softened near the close. The future is miserable. As a result, compared to the previous close, the hot stocks Yongsha, Meiya, Xinyihe, Jingfu, and Xinguang each fell 2% to half or more. Qinxing fell very little. Among the cold stocks, Datong Cement rose slightly, and Wuhe and Rongfeng were flat. The rest fell slightly to a half or more. Outside the market, each stock also fell slightly.

Foreign stocks continued to be weak yesterday. New buying disappeared from each stock, forming a situation where the supply side dominated. However, there was a slight rebound after the low. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yipi, Paper, Shipping, Huide, and General each fell by half or more. The rest fell, although not much.

### Rice Prices Rebound After Continuous Declines: Raw Peanuts in Demand, Market Prosperous

Over 12,000 shi of rice arrived from the north and south. After continuous sharp declines, stores took advantage of the opportunity to take in, and southern japonica rice rebounded by over 2,000 yuan. White japonica rice also rose by over 1,000 yuan, and indica rice also rose by 1,000 yuan. Yin yuan followed suit, increasing by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. White yuan was high and profitable, and secondary was sluggish. The southern market closed firmly, and the northern market closed slightly weaker. There was a slight movement of Fuzhou soybeans, and the factories made a slight move. Recently, due to a slight reduction in incoming goods and a decrease in inventory, the price rose by over 1,000 yuan. Soybean cakes continued to come from Taiwan and rose by another 100 to 200 yuan. The source of flour continued to continue, digesting its slackness. Wheat sales were sluggish, and corn sales were weak in other areas. Cowpeas were sluggish, and the price fell by 1,000 yuan. Sesame was clearly fixed and secretly increased, and the price of black sesame rose by 1,000 yuan. Raw peanuts from Nanyang were still in operation, and transactions on this street also increased. Demand exceeded supply, and arrivals were not as good as sales, soaring by 4,000 to 5,000 yuan. Towel stalls also increased by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan, which felt quite lively. The oil market was firm, and the factories distributed a total of 300 dan of soybean oil and rapeseed oil, 3 dan per household.

### Mortgages and Purchases: Two Requests from the Tea Industry

The Shanghai Tea Export Industry Association held an emergency meeting yesterday, chaired by Secretary Ji Shanshan. Two points were unanimously decided: 1. Request the government to handle tea mortgages, intending to request the Chinese Farmers Bank to provide a 70% mortgage based on the production cost of tea, with an interest rate of 3% and an intermediate period of 3 months; 2. Hope that the government will purchase. The association will formally apply to the relevant authorities for the above two items.

### Woolen Fabric Trend Weak: Especially Grass Green Listless

Due to various domestic and international factors, the woolen fabric market has generally been weak recently, with few wholesale and retail transactions. The asking price for grass green, grass yellow, thick and thin serge, yellow cloth, gabardine, riding breeches, etc., continues to be lower, and most are even lower than the original cost. The demand from buyers is still extremely lacking. Because most government agencies have allocations, and influenced by blankets and yellow cloth, it is difficult to get a good price for military and political orders. The labor cost of 200,000 per set is still considered too high (each set of guest clothes with raw materials is estimated at 300,000 yuan). Clothing stores in various ports are tasteless and unwilling to operate.

### Municipal Finance Bureau Approves Exemption: Food Business Tax, Cooking Oil and Soybean Cake Not Included

[Report from Our Newspaper] Director Gu of the Finance Bureau, in response to the Shanghai food industry's request to postpone the collection of business tax, convened representatives from seven industry associations at the Finance Bureau at 3:00 pm yesterday, including the soybean and rice industry, rice number industry, rice and grain sales industry, rice milling industry, flour industry, miscellaneous grain oil cake industry, and miscellaneous grain oil cake retail industry. Director Gu stated that he would approve the request from the food industry to postpone the collection of business tax on food. However, it is said that cooking oil and soybean cake are not included.

### One Million Tons of Soybeans: Exchange for One Million Tons of American Wheat

Our country lacks food, among which the supply of wheat is the most serious. It is expected that there will be a shortage before the wheat harvest next year. The authorities are striving to order foreign wheat to meet the raw material needs of domestic flour. According to reliable sources, in order to enrich the food supply, President Song has, in addition to instructing the food diplomacy department to negotiate with the United States, Canada, and other countries to order foreign wheat, also contacted the US government to exchange one million tons of soybeans from our Northeast for the same amount of US wheat, so that each can get its use. It is said that this suggestion has been submitted to the US side and will be clear soon.

### Import and Export Trade Association to Expand Membership

The China Import and Export Trade Association was established in Chongqing in 1944. After the victory, the general association moved to Shanghai. It held its sixth board meeting yesterday and decided to expand its membership, raise business funds, and actively develop association affairs. It will also compile a directory of national import and export firms and a directory of national trade figures for reference by Chinese and foreign business circles.

### More Buying News in the Gold Market: Foreign Currencies Also Eagerly Bought

Yesterday, the situation worsened, and the price of gold was still stable. It opened at 2,458,000, and buyers were eager, gradually increasing. From 2,452,000, it gradually rose to 2,468,000 before the pressure increased and it fell back. Buyers on the practical sales side are still waiting to see the relationship, temporarily announcing a wait-and-see attitude. It fell to 2,440,000. At 10 o'clock, the Central Bank allocated 200 bars at a price of 2,442,500. Since then, the silver market has remained loose, and various bullish news has been prevalent. At noon, it rebounded to around 2,455,000. The afternoon was extremely flat, up 3,000 compared to the previous close. There was no change in decorated gold, silver ingots, or silver dollars. Hidden interest rates ranged from 11 to 14%, as silver remained flat.

Foreign currencies continued to prosper yesterday. New buying rose, and even the usually deserted Hong Kong tickets were being sought after. Buying sentiment was very strong. The black market for US dollars rose from 4,300 yuan to 4,380 yuan, continuing to advance compared to the previous close. Hong Kong tickets also rose, increasing to over 900 yuan. As a result, it rose another 20 yuan, passively bringing Hong Kong exchange rates up to around 880 yuan. The British exchange rate was 14,150 yuan to 14,250 yuan, the Indian exchange rate was 1,060 yuan to 1,070 yuan, and the US exchange rate remained inactive.

### Business Tax Improves Collection Methods: Avoid Dispatching Personnel to Check Accounts; Industry Associations Responsible for Certification; Tax Rates Being Submitted for Review and Reduction

[Report from Our Newspaper] The collection of business tax has been under the management of the Finance Bureau since its transfer from the Direct Tax Bureau. The autumn tax collection is already underway. The collection method has changed greatly compared to the period when the Direct Tax Bureau handled it. The principle is to call on city business associations and industry associations to participate in the review. Each collection office has no authority to check accounts or estimate increases. The audit section is independent, but can only suspend account books for inspection at the bureau and invite representatives from business associations and industry associations to handle them jointly. A concrete plan has already been drafted and was presented yesterday afternoon at the bureau to solicit opinions from industry associations and explain the bureau's policies. Director Gu and Chief Section Officer He Yiwu personally attended. The City Business Association sent representatives Pan Shihao and Zhu Shangyi to the meeting. Director Gu sincerely expressed that if the City Business Association and industry associations can be responsible for proving that the tax reports of the industry are correct, account checking can be omitted. In the future, after each collection office receives the reports from each taxpayer, the bureau will issue them to the relevant industry association for review in order to ensure accuracy. He hopes that everyone will assist to bring tax administration into order. Section Chief He also gave a detailed explanation of the reporting, review, and investigation methods. He still asks the heads of each industry to be responsible for assisting in order to be open. The business association and representatives of each industry elaborated on the reduction of tax rates and how to clearly define the responsibilities of the industry associations and unanimously expressed their willingness to assist in order to completely eliminate the evil practice of harshness. After the meeting, Director Gu retained the representatives of the business association for a cordial discussion and scheduled to reconvene the various industries that did not attend this time to continue the discussion. After the meeting, someone told others that according to the city government's budget, the business tax for the second half of this year should be 9 billion yuan. If it can be collected without harshness, it should not cause any obstacles. However, industry associations should also act cautiously and take into account both the top and the bottom in order to be successful. According to informed sources, the tax rate is currently 1.5% across the board. The authorities have already submitted a request for reduction, but the autumn tax collection will still be collected at the original rate. Those whose income relies on commissions will also be given discretionary treatment. However, those who conceal their income and do not report it, or those who reverse the facts, will not be tolerated.

### Japanese Silkworm Cocoons Not Coming

MacArthur's Headquarters Does Not Allow Export: Foreign Minister Wang Replied to Chu Fucheng

Regarding the matter of transporting Japanese silkworm cocoons to China, the Three-Area Silk Reeling Association telegraphed the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and MacArthur's Headquarters to expedite the transportation of Japanese silkworm cocoons to China in order to meet the raw material needs of silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. It is learned that Foreign Minister Wang Shijie replied to Director Chu Fucheng of the association yesterday. The original letter is as follows: "Regarding the transportation of Japanese silkworm cocoons to China, I have received your letter. According to the report from the Resident Mission in Japan on the 2nd of last month, the China Silk Company in Shanghai requested that the Allied Headquarters Trade Group be asked to allocate some of the remaining Japanese dry silkworm cocoons for sale to China in order to meet urgent needs. Subsequently, the group replied that the Japanese inventory was only sufficient for domestic use and could not be approved for export. A subsequent letter was sent to the Chief of Staff of the Headquarters, detailing the reasons and requesting consideration. In addition to telegraphing the Mission to report the latest developments in the negotiations, I am writing to you to inquire."

In order to thoroughly resolve the future difficulties of the entire silk reeling industry, the Three-Area Silk Association held a standing council meeting at the China Silk Company at 2:00 pm yesterday to discuss concrete measures for the government to adopt.

### Bank of England Relinquishes Silver Market

[Reuters, London, 13th] It has finally been revealed here that the Bank of England has now relinquished the silver market and is now transferring its US silver purchasing rights to London gold and silver brokers. The ostensible reason for this move by the Bank is that Britain will soon replace silver coins with copper wire coins for use as circulating currency, so the Bank of England no longer needs to act as an intermediary. The underlying reason is that the Bank of England has acknowledged that the purchase of silver by speculators is probably more profitable than by official bodies. Under the new plan, the Bank will no longer buy silver itself, but will instead allocate US dollars to London gold and silver brokers so that they can purchase it directly from the United States and then resell it to users in essential industries here. However, the Bank of England will still control the quantity purchased by controlling the allocation of US dollars for the purchase of silver. But this quantity will not be large, as the quantity purchased with US dollars will continue to be limited to essential industries here, so the official London market will continue to supply at a price of 55.5 pence per ounce.

### Spinning Control Committee Expects Black Market in Cotton Yarn to Be Eliminated; Adjustments to Yarn Allocation by Count Will Begin with Reporting

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Spinning Control Committee held its eleventh regular meeting yesterday at 5:00 PM. A summary of the discussions follows: (1) The black market price of cotton yarn still exists because some merchants who bought in at high prices have not yet cleared their stock. However, it is estimated that after this batch of high-priced goods is cleared by the end of this month, the black market price of cotton yarn will naturally disappear. (2) To date, very few people holding allocation slips have returned them to the factories for refunds. (3) In the past month, over 20,000 bales of Wuhan cotton yarn have arrived. Many of these were transported to Guangzhou via the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, causing a sudden surge in traffic on the railway, and even a black market for transportation prices. (4) Recently, due to price negotiation issues, cotton yarn in Shanghai has been shipped out to other areas, causing the black market price in Changzhou to be lower than that in Shanghai. (5) Regarding the request from the Reproduction Products Guild to adjust the count and quantity of yarn allocated, and the application for yarn allocation from newly joined members, all Reproduction Products Guilds are urged to promptly report the current actual production, equipment status, and actual needs of each factory of their members in detail for review and approval. (6) In principle, there are no more issues with the Central Bank providing foreign exchange for cotton purchases. However, all yarn mills should quickly report their current cotton inventory to the Spinning Control Committee for review and approval.

Additionally, application forms for the Spinning Control Committee's yarn for transport to the south must be submitted before the 25th of each month. Late submissions will be considered as a waiver, and the Spinning Control Committee will allocate the waived amount to other needy manufacturers in the following month.

### Caustic Soda in Chaos: Vigorous Purchasing and Simultaneous Reports of Goods Arriving and Being Distributed

Chemical raw materials in general high demand, including soda ash, rosin, beeswax, and potassium chlorate, have all risen by 10 to 20 percent. Potassium chlorate purchased by merchants from Jiangxi has risen to 95,000 yuan per dan (approximately 50 kg). The price of American caustic soda soared again the day before yesterday, reaching 1.15 million yuan for 300 kilograms. Those holding the goods are still holding out for higher prices. Yesterday, local Shanghai manufacturers were again eager to buy, and merchants from other provinces were planning to raise prices to compete, making the market extremely tight. However, some believe that this soaring price is purely due to speculation, and that actual sales are not that high. Furthermore, goods are continuously arriving from Europe and Hong Kong, with prices half of the market price. A certain foreign firm received 2,000 barrels yesterday and it is said that distribution will begin soon.

### Chen You Cup Basketball Tournament: Shantou Team vs. Green Forest; Three Games in Group A and B Tonight

The Chen You Cup Basketball League continues tonight from 6:00 PM with three games in Groups A and B, still held at the YMCA Gymnasium in Baxianqiao. Tickets are uniformly 1,000 yuan. The first game, between Lianqing of Group B and Youai Green, starts at 6:00 PM. This is followed by the Six Points Team, returning from Taiwan with honors, against Muir. The highlight of the evening, starting at 7:30 PM, is the game between the Shantou Team and Green Forest. The former is a seasoned veteran of the basketball scene, led by Liu Jingxing, Cai Yanxiong, and Lin Weicong, all skilled and combative players. Green Forest, although a rising young team, has fought hard against strong opponents over the past year. However, their chances of winning against Shantou today are slim. The schedule is as follows:

Lianqing vs. Youai Green (Group B Friendly): 6:00 PM
Muir vs. Six Points Team (Group B Cup): 6:45 PM
Shantou Team vs. Green Forest (Group A Sixth Game): 7:30 PM

The total team scores for each category are listed below:

### Black and White Teams Will Show Their True Colors; Tonight They Face the Expedition Wheel Team; Black and White Women's Team Makes Its Debut Tonight; Starting with the Qinglian Team at 5:45 PM

The Philippine Black and White Men's and Women's Basketball Teams, whose men's team made their debut the day before yesterday, narrowly defeated Renyu by one point. Yesterday, the Basketball Committee decided that the second and third games of the visiting team, one men's and one women's game, would be combined into one day. Ticket prices have been increased accordingly, to 4,000 yuan upstairs and 7,000 yuan downstairs. (If there is only one game in the future, the original price will be restored). Today, in the second game, the Black and White Women's Team will play against Qinglian, and the Black and White Men's Team will play against the Expedition Wheel Team. The day after tomorrow (Sunday), the Snow White Team and the Shantou Team will respectively play. Both women's games will be played under women's rules.

US Military Challenge

It is also reported that the YMCA Basketball Team of the US military intends to challenge the Black and White Team. They have sent a letter to the Basketball Committee requesting that a team or two, composed of elite players selected from the 14 US military teams, be formed to compete against the Philippine team in one or two games. It is said that the Basketball Committee has accepted this in principle.

Debut Performance

In today's game, the women's teams will take the court first at 5:45 PM. The Black and White Women's Team will make its debut against Qinglian. The visiting team swept through Hong Kong and Guangzhou, undefeated (losing only to the Hong Kong All-Star Men's Team), and is accustomed to using men's rules. Changing to women's rules this time may prevent them from fully demonstrating their skills. However, given the team's excellent technique, they will certainly give a fantastic performance. Qinglian's women's basketball skills are improving rapidly, and with Wang Wuli joining the team, their strength has been greatly enhanced, and they will certainly put up a fierce fight against the visiting team.

Facing the Expedition Wheel Team

At 6:30 PM, the men's teams will take the court. The Black and White Men's Team will make its second appearance against the Luoyang Expedition Wheel Team. The Black and White Team's initial performance the night before last was not as good as expected. However, Xiao Huatuo, Fu Yongxin, Guo Guoye, Shen Renshou, and Cai Jindian, the "Five Tigers", are technically outstanding and still received good reviews. Furthermore, the whole team will be more familiar with the venue today and will certainly perform better. The Expedition Wheel Team has repeatedly defeated strong opponents in Shanghai, gaining a reputation. Continuing their expedition to Beijing and Wuxi, they have maintained their momentum, dominating southern Jiangsu. Yu Ruizhang, Tu Wenlong, and Cai Zhongqiang, the "Three Musketeers," are energetic and lively. Having waited in Shanghai for a long time to face the Black and White Team, they will finally have their wish fulfilled and will certainly do their best in the game, fighting the visiting team to the death. The schedule for the two days and the rosters of the four teams for today are listed below:

November 15 (Friday)

Black and White Women vs. Qinglian (Women): 5:45 PM

### Jiangsu Provincial Basketball Tournament in Full Swing

[Report from Our Newspaper in Suzhou] Major General Ma Shigong, Commander of the Suzhou Garrison, has initiated the organization of the Wu County Sports Promotion Committee to promote sports and strengthen the national physique. The All-Suzhou Basketball Championship organized by the committee has received enthusiastic responses, with registration reaching a total of 21 men's and women's teams by the deadline of the 11th. After a meeting, it was decided that the competition would be a knockout tournament, and the order of the matches was drawn. At 2:00 PM on the 12th, the Promotion Committee held an opening ceremony at the Dongwu University Gymnasium in Tianshizhuang and began the first day of competition. Thousands of people from all walks of life attended to watch. Commander Ma (concurrently), Commissioner Xu of the Second District, and Secretary Jin of the County Party Committee all delivered speeches. After the ceremony, Commander Ma (concurrently) tossed the ball to begin the competition. In the first game, the 202nd Division's Youth Army Team faced the Dongwu University West Team. The two teams were evenly matched, and the game was full of excitement. The 202nd Division's fast passing and unusual tactics made it difficult for Dongwu to cope. In the end, the 202nd Division won 39-27. In the second game, Nanxing faced Kangle. Although Nanxing had a reputation as the champion of the Fuxing Cup, Kangle had famous players such as sports pioneers Shi Jiuquan, Wang Shoufang, and Li Jianbang. After the game started, Nanxing quickly became overwhelmed and retreated step by step, suffering a crushing defeat of 15-31. In the third game, Taihe faced Jingfan. Taihe was an amateur team, while Jingfan was a school team. Although Jingfan had received good training and rarely committed fouls, Taihe's effective offense and fast coordination ultimately led to a 14-10 victory by one point, and Jingfan was defeated. There will be three more games on the 13th: Dongwu High School vs. 202nd Division Youth Army Ze Team, Yancheng vs. Cuiying, and Pingguang vs. 16th Artillery Regiment. Subsequent matches will be held daily until the champion is decided on the 20th. The atmosphere has been enthusiastic in recent days, and the road to Tianshizhuang has been filled with spectators.

### The Front Line of the Northern Section of the Pinghan Railway

— Special Correspondent Song Shaobo stationed in Beiping for this Newspaper

Beiping Air Mail on the 4th

When the war on the northern section of the Pinghan Railway was at its most intense, I was ordered on October 30th to go to the front line of the Pingbao section to inspect. The places I stopped along the way were Songlin Store, Ding, Beihe Store, Gucheng, and Xushui. Taking advantage of the fact that the communist army and the national army were concentrating their forces in Chahar Province, the communist army launched an offensive on the northern section of the Pinghan Railway starting from September 29th, advancing northwards and capturing cities. After the war in Chahar Province came to an end, a main force of the national army transferred to this line, gradually recovering lost locations such as Songlin Store. By November 2nd, Xushui was recovered, and the communist army's control over the Pingbao section had disintegrated. I returned to Beiping on the evening of the 3rd. The commander of the 94th Army, Mou Tingfang, who commanded the national army's operations in this section, returned to Ping from the front on the same day to report the course of operations to the authorities and to discuss the next step of opening up the Baoshi section.

I met Commander Mou Tingfang and his staff, division commanders, and Wang Lihuan, the division commander of the 130th Division of the 53rd Army, who was temporarily under Mou Tingfang's command and advancing towards the front. This is a soldier who has always stood at the forefront. Commander Mou, who set up the forward command post in Zhuoxian, went to the front almost every day to supervise the army. At 10:30 AM on the 2nd, when Xushui was recovered, Commander Mou entered the city with me and others at 11:30 AM. When Commander Mou shook hands with Commander Wang, who had entered the city with the army, he showed the joy of a soldier after victory.

On the other hand, I spent more time visiting Cui Shichang, the commissioner of the 6th Administrative Region of Hebei Province, who had his office in Zhuoxian (he was the chief of staff when Fu Zuoyi was besieged in Zhuoxian for three months in the 16th year of the Republic of China, and the deputy chief of staff when Liu Zhi was the commander of the 6th War Zone), as well as the county magistrates of each county, and the common people under artillery fire. During the five-day field trip, I got the following impressions: "Fighting the communists is easy and difficult." "Both sides are good, but it's not good for us common people." "Years of construction destroyed in an instant will not be able to be rebuilt by our own existing strength." "The common people are caught between 'traitorous bandits' and 'Eighth Route Army'." "Local administration and military affairs are paramount." "Generals fighting in the war have peace hidden in their hearts."

Fighting the Communist Army is Easy and Difficult

Can military force solve the problem? A definitive answer still cannot be obtained on the front line. Perhaps it can be said this way: those who personally fight the communist army are mostly cautious about this issue. Officers below the rank of regimental commander do not underestimate the communist army. The goals that the national army wants to achieve are almost always achieved, but the energy spent on each stronghold after occupation is no less than during the attack. Every time the national army attacks a target, no matter how fierce the battle is, the communist army ultimately retreats. If the air force cooperates well, the communist army will suffer even more severe losses on the vast plains of the north. In the battle of Xushui County and the railway station, 5,000 communist soldiers were exposed to the air force's machine guns, and the communist army suffered great losses in this battle, but they did not lose their weapons, and the distance of the evacuation was only ten miles. They are ready to make a comeback at any time. One communist soldier is served by three common people. These common people often die on the two grenades he wears on his body. According to a soldier, the communist soldiers who charge are common people (called militiamen by the communist side), and those who sneak into the national army's positions at night to throw grenades and bury mines are also common people. These "militiamen," who have been slightly trained, die by the hundreds and thousands! Because of this, I asked Commander Mou whether he would allow these common people, who hardly know what fighting is, to die in such large numbers? Commander Mou said: "If you don't kill him, he will throw grenades at you!" "Don't those people know they will be killed?" "If he doesn't die under the guns of the national army, he will die in the hands of the communist army behind him. He has to go up!" Among the tens of thousands of common people repairing the railway, I saw that there were indeed few adults!

"Pocket tactics" was a tactic used by the communist army this time between Caohe and Xushui, but under the national army with excellent equipment, the "pocket" was pierced by the iron thorn, and the main force had to retreat to the western mountains. In order to always catch the main force of the communist army, the 94th Army formed a motorized rapid force in the last two days, which gave the communist army a serious threat. The communist army's tactics have always been to hide during the day and attack at night, but the communist army in the Pingbao section turned into retreating during the day. They occasionally attacked the national army's strongholds at night, but not once was successful. However, it is still not easy to eliminate the communist army. According to a chief of staff who commanded the battle, the biggest trouble for the national army is the feeling that the local military force and politics do not cooperate with the military, which makes people unable to avoid worries about the future. The village-level cadres of the government are far less powerful than the village-level cadres of the Communist Party, which is a very simple problem. The security police force and the self-defense regiment are poorly armed and poorly trained, and it is difficult to avoid losing the stronghold under the communist army's concentrated force. Because the loss of the city is too great, Sun Lianzhong, the chairman of Hebei Province, recently issued an order that all county magistrates who lose the city will be dismissed regardless of the reason.

Years of Construction Destroyed in an Instant

In the places I passed, the only job of those common people every day was "digging up the road" and "repairing the road." In the future, there may also be a "watching the road" task to come to their heads. According to a railway worker, he knew that a telephone pole had been cut down more than 500 times. The length of the railway that was dug up in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway this time was as long as 150 kilometers, and more than 80 holes of steel bridges were blown up. In order to dig up the road, the communist army specially organized an engineering battalion. The speed and thoroughness of the destruction can be called the world's first. The 29 holes of the steel bridge in Beihe Store were completely blown up, the bridge foundation collapsed, and the bridge was blown up. According to an old man in his eighties, it took exactly six years to build this steel bridge back then, and it took three nights to destroy it under the communist army's excellent technology. The deafening explosions killed nine infants in the neighboring village who were less than two months old. It may not be possible for our technology to succeed in repairing it again. In order to prevent the roadbed from being built for a while, the communist army drove the common people within dozens of miles to dig deep ditches with curved and staggered lines. Steel rails were placed on the sleepers and burned with fire. The sleepers burned into ashes, and the steel rails became scrap iron. According to the authorities of the Pinghan Railway, the existing equipment has almost been used up. Such a large-scale destruction makes it really difficult to repair. Therefore, the road repair project is only a few miles a day. On the roadbed that has just been repaired, it takes two hours to travel thirty miles. On the road, passengers can get off the bus to urinate and still get back on the bus. All the houses and railway facilities of the Songlin Store, Gaobeidian, Dingxing, Beihe Store, Gucheng and other stations I saw were completely destroyed. The thoroughness of the destruction in Beihe Store made people pass by the place without knowing that it had been a station. Now the railway people work in the iron gate car. The local government is launching "labor service." Every day, 20,000 common people repair the road. Old men in their seventies and eighties and children in their teens each bring two corn rations to do this uncompensated work until it is repaired. An old man repairing the road said with wet eyes: "We already knew when we were driven to destroy that we would still be the ones repairing the road!" Some people who had railway equipment hidden in their homes sent it back, but most of it was no longer usable. Anyone who had a rail spike found in their home was guilty of collaborating with the communists. In addition to the railway, all public buildings in the places that the communist army occupied and evacuated were also completely destroyed. No one has been able to calculate the number of such large-scale destruction. Seeing these remnants of destruction really makes people feel like the end of the world is coming. Commander Mou usually doesn't say much when talking about the communist army, but every time he mentions the communist army's destructive behavior, he will angrily say "Damn it."

Xiao Peisun, the secretary-general of the Zhuoxian County Party Department, told me that when he went to the countryside to inspect, he asked the common people whether the Communist Party or the government was better. The common people replied with sad faces: "The Communist Party is good, and the government is also good, but what is not good is us common people!" He almost burst into tears when he heard this. The kind common people don't understand any ideology, they only know that every army that comes wants them to take things out. The houses were even destroyed by artillery fire before the army arrived. The Communist Party wants to conscript "militiamen." Although they all know and even see "militiamen" being killed by guns, they still have to let their sons be conscripted.

Common People Complain: Secretary Xiao Almost Bursts into Tears

The common people in the areas where the national army is stationed generally say that the discipline of the national army is much stronger than before the War of Resistance. This is the first time these common people have seen the national army. Although the burden is heavier, they hope that the national army will stay. The common people are terrified of the tug-of-war. Therefore, they secretly wish to take out more things. Speaking of the 94th Army, it has won the love of the local common people. The only thing the army takes from the local area is firewood, and there is no difficulty in requisitioning it. At present, each soldier gets enough dry firewood, and the price is 50 yuan, which is half the market price. This is because the public funds issued from above can only afford this amount. In addition, the local burden on the army is to buy coffins for the soldiers who died in battle and requisition them, giving 8,000 yuan a day, which can be called public buying and selling, and the merchants are welcome to station the national army, so their business will be better. What is painful is the subsidy for local teams and administrative personnel, which will kill the merchants. To give an example, a security team has one hundred and one people, and the total public funds are one million per month, which is eight or nine thousand per person. It is not enough to eat a corn bun once a day, but they have to live in order to protect the local area, so the local area has to bear this amount. A merchant in Zhuoxian told me that his store sells about 100,000 yuan a day and has a total of twelve partners, but since this year, he has paid nearly one million yuan in contributions. He said that if this continues, how many stores will close by the end of the year? The shocking burden is even more incalculable. The communist party's conscription, liquidation, and the government's apportionments and land taxes. If one mu of land yields one dan of grain a year, seven dou of rice must be taken out to respond to "official errands." Although it is a national army garrison, it is still impossible not to give grain to the communist party, because except for the county seat, few villages belong completely to the national army day and night. Aside from apportionments, corvee is secondary. After the war started, there were about 10,000 refugees from neighboring counties who fled to Zhuoxian, who could not be saved without help. Although the provincial government issued 10 million yuan in relief funds every time, it is unknown how much was used for emergency relief. These refugees are looking forward to the relief from the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.

### Inspection Record of Chahar, Shanxi, and Suiyuan: Inside and Outside the Great Wall (3)

— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Hang Zhou

I live in Room 207 of the Chahar Hotel. There is a wooden cupboard that the communist army did not take away. When I opened it, I saw a slogan written in chalk: "Go to Democracy!" In Zhangjiakou, such slogans can even be found in the toilets. When the war in northern Jiangsu was fierce, I traveled in that bloody land for three months and had some understanding of the Communist Party's so-called "democracy." This time I came to Zhangjiakou, hoping to get a different impression. I said, I hope to hear some good criticisms of the Communist Party from the people, even if it is one in a thousand or ten thousand, it is enough to satisfy my curiosity.

### Traitors to Democracy

Huang Yuan, the member of the Communist Party Chahar Provincial Government who represents the working class, was originally a worker in the Ping Sui Railway Machinery Depot. He is forty-three years old this year and has only studied for three years. He has been doing work peacefully for eighteen years. When the Communist Party came, in order to show "democracy," they wanted the workers to elect a representative to participate in the government. He was elected in a daze, which he had never dreamed of! He became a member in fear and opened many meetings, but the meetings only ate refreshments or attended banquets, and he was not asked to express his opinions at all, and it was impossible to express his opinions. The Provincial Government Committee has a so-called "three-thirds system," which means that the Communist Party occupies three seats, and the rest belong to various parties and non-parties. This is a puppet show, and Huang Yuan has been a puppet for nearly a year. Well, when the national army arrived in Zhangjiakou, Huang Yuan abandoned his wife and children and surrendered to the national army. He felt comforted in his conscience.

I asked him: "Are you not afraid that your wife and children will suffer?"

"There is no way!" He said with a sad face: "I don't know where they went!" Xu Chenqiu, the commander of the communist army guard regiment, who has defected, now has a new title: Commander of the Chahar Southwest Bandit Suppression. He said: "The Communist Party's democratic logic is like this: the minority obeys the interests of the majority, and the interests of the majority obey the interests of the party." Therefore, violating the interests of the party is not democratic. This is indeed the true spirit of Mao Zedong's "New Democracy."

What the Communist Party can be very relieved about is that there are almost "no" minority interests in the so-called "liberated areas." A worker said: "We have to raise our hands even if we don't agree. What we say is like farting. Once, I said a few words, and they thought it was unpleasant and was hanged for a day and a night." A doctor who was "honorably" elected as a senator by the Communist Party told me: "On the first day of the meeting, I put forward several proposals, and the next day I was warned." "Freedom of speech" is established under such circumstances: when two communists are talking, how can they not eavesdrop? When two friends meet on the street, a communist must be standing next to them to be able to talk. In this way, the Communist Party has completed their "brilliant" "democratic politics."

If all the people are as stupid as cows, pointing east and going east, and never turning north when pointing west, wouldn't the world be settled? Therefore, the Communist Party brought out the policy of fooling the people from the "coffin" of history, starting with the cadres. Farmers, blacksmiths, and Jianghu heroes who kill, set fire, are the most standard talents. Intellectuals, bah! Useless guys, there is a big problem with their brains, they must be thoroughly reformed. A communist army company commander who had defected told me that it was because he had studied for a few years that he could not become a party member, and he was always neglected.

Intellectuals and people over forty years old have to be sent to the "cold palace," and may even suffer the "cha" knife. Because they are "stubborn," easily shaken, and obstacles to their uniform "democratic politics." But the Communist Party also has its one-line education.

A sixteen-year-old first-year junior high school student said: "In school, the teachers always teach us to dance and sing Yangko...A year's time has been wasted, and we have not gained any basic knowledge.

"But in addition to this, we must take political class every day. What Marxism is, the merits of the Eighth Route Army, the bastards of the diehards...A big set of ramblings. Teachers often do not bring textbooks when they come to class, they only teach us to read newspapers."

Zhang Guanxing, a reporter from the Associated Press, asked him a question: "You have taken political class for a year, can you talk about the content of Marxism?"

He laughed: "Everyone must attend political class, and the classroom is so quiet that you can hear a pin drop. It turns out that everyone is tired of sleeping.--So I don't understand at all now."

Then he said: "Dismantling rotten things is a good student. If you study hard, the school will suspect: 'Are you related to Nanjing?'"

The Communist Party's education for workers is also like this. They sing loudly about the "three-eight system," but they still have to work two more hours every day. During the so-called study, it is a political class. There are two workers in the Zhangjiakou South Power Plant, one is called "steamed not cooked" and the other is called "boiled not rotten." The one called "boiled not rotten" said to me: "As soon as the bell rings, you have to lower your head and go. If you don't go, they will call you a 'national agent'. But whether I listen to it or not is up to me. I usually turn a deaf ear to it, so they call me 'boiled not rotten'." This should be the Communist Party's sorrow!

### The Story of Counting Chicken Eggs

"Struggle," "settle accounts," and "turn over." These are the Communist Party's three-in-one "revolutionary" methods. In name, it seems to be striving for the working masses and attacking the bourgeoisie; but tearing down the western mirror reveals it to be the most vicious method of plunder.

For example, the land struggle launched by tenant farmers against landlords, which is attracting worldwide attention, is also a way to absorb land in the so-called "tenant farmer liberation movement."

After the landlords are overthrown, the land is distributed, part of it becomes public land, and part of it becomes the private property of powerful Communist Party members (Communist Party cadres are not corrupt, that is to say to three-year-old children). The tenant farmers get only a small part. And this new "landlord," when he was a tenant farmer, could live by paying rent. Now, of his harvest, he is only allowed to keep one and a half rents of wheat for his whole family. The rest is collected according to "points." The so-called "point" is a unit based on one dan. If the harvest is three dan of wheat, in addition to the one rent and five dou left, there is also one rent and five dou, which is "one and a half points." There is no standard for collection, nor is there a fixed period. Sometimes, one point requires five dou to be collected, and sometimes it has to be collected twice a month. The final result of the collection is: all the harvests, including the one rent and a half left, are collected, or are not enough. Therefore, "If the benefits do not belong to me, why should I love the land?" The common people are all willing to give up the land and let it lie fallow.

Regarding settling accounts, there is a "chicken egg accounting story":

The Eighth Route Army asked a coolie: "Hey! Has that wealthy family ever borrowed money from you?"

"Old man, don't joke! If I had money to lend to others, I wouldn't be like this."

"Then have they ever borrowed wheat from you?"

"There is more wheat rotting in their warehouses every year!"

"Stupid guy! I'm asking you if they ever borrowed chicken eggs from you?" The Eighth Route Army asked impatiently and sternly.

The coolie was stunned and said, "They did borrow a chicken egg."

The Eighth Route Army raised his eyebrows: "How long ago did they borrow it?"

"It's been a few years, maybe four years! They were making a feast and were one chicken egg short. They came to my house to borrow it and said they would return it tomorrow. Tomorrow, uh, they probably forgot. Uh, it's just one chicken egg, it doesn't matter!" The coolie scratched his head and said.

"Stupid guy! One chicken egg is a big deal! Tell you, you have to settle accounts with them! I'll help you earn a living!" The Eighth Route Army showed his jagged yellow teeth.

He was even more confused--how to calculate it? So, the Eighth Route Army told him: One chicken egg can hatch a chick. When the chick grows into a hen, it will lay at least one hundred chicken eggs a year. One hundred chicken eggs hatch into one hundred chicks, and when the chicks grow into hens, one hundred hens can lay 10,000 chicken eggs a year. The eggs hatch into chickens again, and the chickens lay eggs again. After four years, one chicken egg is equal to tens of thousands of chickens. Isn't this number considerable? Why don't you settle accounts with him?

The coolie seemed to suddenly see the light: "That's right! I still have such a big debt outside!"

So, one, two, three, count to ten thousand years!

The wealthy family was ruined, and not to mention repaying the debt for a chicken egg four years ago. They fled. The coolie became the master of this property. The Eighth Route Army, carrying a Mauser pistol, winked at him and said:

"Hey, stupid kid! This time it's enough for you to enjoy. Who gave you such a benefit?"

"The Communist Party!"

"Stupid kid! You should repay Ong Da!"

The new rich man was stunned again: "Old man, what are you saying?"

The one carrying the Mauser pistol took out a slip of paper with the words: "Donate 30% for the living expenses of the soldiers, and 50% to participate in the cooperative fund."

"Look, this is how you are a patriot!"

Okay, he still has 20%--at least it's better than nothing, he is still very happy.

As usual, what Zhang San got has to be donated. After several cycles of liquidation, everything was donated.

### Twenty Minutes' Chat with a Platoon Leader

Ignorant and unlearned people, although they do not understand politics and do not care about dynasties, understand in their hearts. They think over and over about following the Eighth Route Army in their struggles. The result of the liquidation is that the rich have become poor, but the poor have not become rich. The poor only get hatred! The Communist Party attempts to create hatred between people to consolidate their rule and carry out their exploitation. As a result, they are burned by the fire they started: the rich, needless to say, abhor the Communist Party, but what is truly a miracle is that even the poor grit their teeth in hatred!

Within the Communist Party's own ranks, as long as there is still a shred of humanity, they are deeply disgusted with the Party's brutal policies. I had a twenty-minute conversation with an Eighth Route Army platoon leader who surrendered. He said resentfully, "Those who participated in the Long March occupy a special position in the Eighth Route Army. This group of people are arrogant, self-indulgent, and do whatever they want." Non-Long March cadres below the battalion level are restricted in everything, and even marriage is not free. On the contrary, for battalion commanders and above, encouraging marriage is a way to win them over. Once married, they have more worries and are bound to obey orders obediently.

He resented the war, feeling that it was unjustifiable. He told me: Once, when he was going to the front line, he sighed, "Alas! Self-inflicted fratricide!" When the political instructor found out, he was subjected to individual talks, then group criticism, followed by struggle sessions. He said, "I have been in the Eighth Route Army for several years and have made some contributions. To end up like this, why did I come here? Now, many in the Eighth Route Army want to defect, but they are worried about how the Nationalist army will treat them after they defect. If they knew that there would be no hardship, those who are oppressed and used as cannon fodder would defect at any opportunity." From the Nationalist army, I obtained a suicide note from a Communist soldier. It read: "Japan has surrendered, and we should enjoy happiness, but the Eighth Route Army does not let us have a good life, and they arrest young people in every village to fight in the civil war. We made contributions in fighting Japan, for the sake of the people not being oppressed. Now we are fighting a civil war, and even if we die, it is without value. I want to gloriously defect, but I don't know what the Nationalist army is like. If I retreat, I will be shot by the officers, so I commit suicide. Eighth Route Army comrades, defect and escape! Otherwise, you will also be sacrificed on the battlefield. Comrades: Think about who you are fighting for? Who are you dying for!" After talking with many farmers, workers, merchants, students, and defected Communist soldiers, I asked curiously, "Doesn't the Communist Party do anything good for you?"

"Heavens!" an old man exclaimed, "If the Communist Party did any good, wouldn't I follow them?"

A soldier said, "Otherwise, I wouldn't have defected!"...

Commander Fu Zuoyi said to the press corps: "The military failure of the Communist Party can be judged by common sense, but its political failure would not be believed if one did not come to Zhangjiakou, especially the belief that its political failure is so tragic!"

"The Communist Party's propaganda policy can be summarized in one sentence: it is deception!" Fu said again: "The further away people are, the more they sympathize with the Communist Party. People in Kunming or those who sympathize with the Communist Party are more numerous. People in Tianjin are much less so, and in Zhangjiakou, there is a universal hatred of the Communist Party's policies. So some people say: where the Communist Party goes, it is like getting a vaccination, and this place will never have the Communist Party again." Reuters reporter Campbell expressed his feelings: "What I heard in Nanjing has been proven completely wrong here!"

### What is Surgical Treatment?

— Lan Yi

Surgical treatment occupies a special place in modern medicine. Some diseases can only be cured with surgical treatment. However, the general public often has a fearful attitude towards surgical treatment. This is because of the lack of medical knowledge and understanding. It is common to see patients hesitate even after being advised by doctors to undergo surgical treatment, or to seek remedies indiscriminately in the hope of avoiding surgery. As a result, they delay treatment until even surgeons feel helpless. Therefore, to break this fearful attitude, it is essential to have sufficient medical knowledge to avoid unnecessary sacrifices.

What is surgical treatment? Treatment of diseases often uses various methods. Sometimes, instruments are used to perform surgery. This is surgical treatment, or surgical therapy, commonly known as "cutting out the disease" or "surgery." However, the terms "cutting out the disease" or "surgery" cannot encompass all surgical treatments. For example, orthopedic mechanical therapy is also a type of surgical treatment.

The evolution of surgical treatment: Surgical treatment is one of the oldest therapies and is a natural therapy for humans. A thorn or foreign object in the body is always removed. When there is bleeding in the body, pressure is naturally used to stop the bleeding. This is all taught by human nature, which is called surgical treatment in primitive times. Later, as humans gained more experience, understood anatomy, and invented instruments, this treatment gradually progressed, but with little scientific basis, it was still a technical therapy. With the rise of modern science, medical progress has also been rapid. Utilizing the results of scientific research, such as the progress of pathology, bacteriology, physiology, physiological chemistry, and pharmacology, and with the help of sophisticated instruments, and referring to the results of experimental surgery, the scope of surgical treatment is now much wider than it was a hundred years ago.

Scope of surgical treatment

(1) Most surgical treatments are for acute conditions that pose a danger. The body cannot overcome these conditions, and only immediate surgical treatment can save lives. In a wound, bleeding from a major blood vessel can be fatal if hemostasis is not achieved artificially. Injuries to internal organs are even more serious. Without immediate repair or treatment, there is no hope of survival. Sometimes, a person suffers from a disease and suddenly develops a critical symptom, such as intestinal perforation from typhoid fever, gastric ulcer perforation, or diphtheria causing tracheal obstruction. Without immediate surgical treatment to temporarily relieve the fatal danger, life cannot be preserved. This type of surgical treatment does not directly treat typhoid fever, gastric ulcers, or diphtheria, but it removes a major symptom.

(2) In modern cities, everything is done mechanically to save time, which has led to an increasing number of injuries. In early trauma, before infectious bacteria have had time to colonize, a debridement can be performed, which can not only repair the wound and shorten the healing process, but also avoid the sequelae of bacterial infection and spreading to other tissues. Fractures must have surgical treatment. Fractures can heal on their own, but the tension of the muscles can cause the fractured bone to shift from its original position, resulting in shortening of the limb and deformity, eventually leading to disability. Surgery uses mechanical methods to guide and fix the fracture, preventing the muscles from shortening and restoring the normal position, so that the fractured limb can function normally after healing. Surgical treatment can also prevent or correct deformities caused by certain diseases.

(3) Most inflammations in the body are caused by bacterial infection. Some require surgical treatment, which can not only shorten the course of the disease, but also remove the danger. A boil will eventually become an abscess, but the slower the abscess develops, the longer the course of the disease will be. Every suppurating lesion has the potential to allow bacteria to enter the bloodstream and cause blood poisoning. Early incision and drainage can avoid this danger. Surgical treatment is merely following the natural process to shorten the course of the disease and save the patient's strength. Appendicitis (commonly known as appendicitis) may heal on its own without surgery, but it may also suppurate or rupture, leading to peritonitis, which is extremely dangerous. If the inflamed appendix is removed early before suppuration or rupture, the focus of infection can be removed, completely cured, and the great danger of suppuration or rupture can be avoided. Other non-essential organs of the body can also become diseased. If relatively safe therapies are ineffective, surgical treatment can be used as a last resort, depending on whether it affects the body's function.

(4) The body is not without a protective response to the invasion of foreign objects. A bullet in the body can be surrounded by fibrous tissue and remain in the body for decades without causing danger. A splinter in the body can cause suppuration and be discharged with the pus. However, if foreign objects remain in the body and obstruct important organs or functions, surgical treatment should be used to remove them to avoid future problems, such as kidney stones, bladder stones, gallstones, etc., which are all best removed.

(5) Tumors are pathological forms of tissue in the body, similar to foreign objects. However, they grow by relying on the blood supply of the body, so they are very detrimental to health. Benign tumors may not cause patients to feel pain, but if they grow too large or are located in an unfavorable position, they can also obstruct the body and should be removed as soon as possible. Malignant tumors are directly harmful to the body and can endanger life. Most malignant tumors are difficult to detect because the symptoms are not obvious. By the time patients discover them on their own, it is often too late. Therefore, if something feels abnormal in a certain part of the body, it is best to see a doctor for examination as soon as possible. Sometimes, an X-ray examination is needed to make a diagnosis. Regarding treatment, although radium has recently been discovered and can be used to treat malignant tumors, it is not widely used, and surgical treatment is still commonly used. Early treatment can prevent tumor cells from metastasizing to other parts of the body, causing damage to the entire body. Therefore, the success of treatment depends on the earliness of diagnosis.

The safety of surgical treatment? Everyone knows that one should seek medical treatment early when sick. The safety of surgical treatment is also closely related to the time of seeking medical treatment. The earlier one seeks medical treatment, the safer the surgery will be. If one has a surgical illness and still prays to gods, worships Buddha, casts lots, or takes one or two doses of herbal medicine in the hope of being cured, this will only delay treatment and reduce the safety of surgical treatment. Therefore, early medical treatment can lead to early surgical treatment, which solves the patient's safety problem. Once the safety issue is clearly understood, there will be no fear.

### Talking About Menstruation

— Liu Benli

Menstruation in women is a common physiological phenomenon. Readers must be familiar with the term menstruation. But what exactly is menstruation? What are the related circumstances of its occurrence? Even if we ask the ladies who have experienced it themselves, probably few people understand these questions. Simply put, menstruation is a periodic uterine blood discharge, which occurs roughly regularly except during pregnancy.

The Mechanism of Menstruation

To discuss menstruation, we must first understand the source of menstruation. Although menstruation is a uterine discharge, its control is in the hands of the ovaries. Without ovaries, the uterus cannot produce menstruation. The ovaries are two almond-sized tissues in the lower abdomen. After a woman develops, they begin to function, creating a follicle every month. Approximately on the fourteenth day of the menstrual cycle, this follicle matures and automatically ruptures, releasing an egg cell from inside. This ruptured follicle becomes the corpus luteum. The corpus luteum has the effect of maintaining pregnancy. If sperm and egg do not meet at this time, it will also automatically disappear after fourteen days. Then comes the menstrual period. This creates a twenty-eight-day cycle. The follicles and the corpus luteum each have their own endocrine hormones to manage the uterine tissue and regulate the menstrual cycle. An ovary that loses its normal function will affect menstruation.

However, the mechanism of menstruation is not so simple, because the ovaries have a close relationship with other endocrine glands, especially the pituitary gland and the thyroid gland. A disordered endocrine system can affect the function of the ovaries, indirectly disrupting menstruation.

General Phenomena of Menstruation

A normal woman should have regular menstruation. The average is once every twenty-eight days. But few women are absolutely accurate. A difference of two or three days is not considered abnormal. The duration of menstruation also varies from person to person. Menstruation for two to six days is normal. Attention should be paid to a duration that is too long or too short.

Menstruation is a type of blood that does not easily clot. The amount of blood is a very difficult thing to measure, especially since it varies from person to person. From indirect evidence, we infer that normal women excrete thirty to one hundred and twenty milliliters of menstrual blood each time. Too much or too little is often an indication of disease. Many people think that menstruation is a filthy thing, and it does not matter if a little more flows out. But if five milliliters are taken from their blood vessels, they would be afraid of anemia. This is indeed a wrong view. Five milliliters of blood cannot harm a person, but a large amount of menstrual flow will undoubtedly cause anemia.

Some women have no abnormal feelings during menstruation. But many women experience one or more discomforts. The most common is dysmenorrhea. According to statistics in the United States, almost half of women experience this, although the degree of pain varies. The treatment of dysmenorrhea is not simple, because it has many causes. Almost half of primary dysmenorrhea can be cured by a simulated pregnancy.

Other symptoms such as headaches, bloating, fatigue, irritability, and breast swelling are also common.

The Beginning and End of Menstruation

The age at which a woman first menstruates varies, and it often varies from person to person and from place to place. The average age is between twelve and sixteen years old. In hotter places, menstruation occurs earlier; in colder places, menstruation occurs later. Chinese women usually begin menstruating at the age of fourteen or fifteen. It is necessary to consult a doctor if menstruation has not started after this age.

On average, a woman's menstruation lasts for about thirty years. It stops around the age of forty-five. Of course, there are exceptions. According to general statistics, we know that women who menstruate early have a later menopause; women who menstruate late will have an earlier menopause.

Menopause is not a sudden phenomenon. It often takes several months to three years to reach the stage of complete cessation of menstruation. During the transition period, menstruation is often irregular, with the cycle either shortened or prolonged. The amount of menstrual flow may also increase or decrease. This period requires close attention, because potentially fatal uterine cancer often occurs during this period, and its symptoms are the same as those described above.

During the transitional period of menopause, many people feel a variety of discomforts. The most common are mental and circulatory instability, such as pessimism, irritability, fatigue, a feeling of slight heat, and intermittent flushing. A large amount of leucorrhea also often occurs during this period. These are not serious situations, but they add to many life's troubles. Treatment is not difficult, and an appropriate amount of estrogen can solve everything.

Causes of Amenorrhea

Amenorrhea is different from menopause. The latter is an inevitable physiological process, while the former is a sign of pregnancy or illness.

In women of reproductive age, amenorrhea is often an indication of pregnancy. But we cannot say that every woman with amenorrhea is pregnant. There are many other situations that can cause amenorrhea.

Emotional stimuli (such as extreme anger, sadness, joy, tension, and fright) and environmental changes (such as travel, relocation, and changes in climate) are possible causes. These do not require special treatment. Menstruation will often return to normal on its own.

Various diseases such as tuberculosis, pneumonia, and typhoid fever often cause amenorrhea, because these diseases lower health. Women with weakened constitutions will experience amenorrhea. Therefore, the goal of treatment is to strengthen the constitution.

Vaginal obstruction is mostly caused by an imperforate hymen, commonly known as "stone maiden." These women do not not have menstruation, but the exit of menstruation is blocked. The diagnosis of this situation is very obvious. The treatment, of course, is to remove the obstruction.

Imbalance of the endocrine system is also a very common cause. Changes in the main endocrine glands such as the pituitary gland, thyroid gland, and ovaries can all affect menstruation to the point of amenorrhea. An underdeveloped uterus cannot produce menstruation, because the endocrine glands have not given it the ability to grow into an adult uterus. In women suffering from malignant goiter, amenorrhea is a very common accompanying condition. So far, the endocrine system is still an incompletely understood science, so treatment is most difficult.

Irregular Menstruation

It is difficult for the average person to distinguish between irregular menstruation and uterine bleeding. There are two causes of true irregular menstruation: one is endocrine system dysfunction, and the other is uterine fibroids. The problem of endocrine amenorrhea has been mentioned earlier. Under different degrees of dysfunction, these endocrine glands do not cause amenorrhea, but cause irregular menstruation. Uterine fibroids can change the structure of the uterus. The uterus is the source of menstruation, so menstruation is disrupted. The success of treatment depends on the accuracy of the diagnosis, especially to distinguish it clearly from the following situations of uterine bleeding:

(1) Pregnancy complications, such as miscarriage, placenta previa, retained placenta, and hydatidiform mole.

(2) Uterine inflammation, such as cervicitis, endometritis, and salpingitis.

(3) Malignant uterine tumors, such as cervical cancer and endometrial cancer.

(4) Oophoritis and ovarian tumors.

Hygiene During Menstruation

Menstrual belts with soft and absorbent materials are most suitable. Normal use should be limited to external use. Except for short periods of time for convenience, methods of placement in the vagina should be avoided.

It is best to take a hot shower during menstruation, in order to avoid bath water from entering the vagina and uterus and causing inflammation. Prolonged hot sitz baths are not suitable, because they can increase local congestion, thereby increasing the amount of discharge. Cold water baths and swimming should be prohibited, as they may cause sudden cessation of menstruation and chronic lower abdominal discomfort.

Exercise during menstruation is not necessarily inappropriate. However, fatigue and strenuous exercise should be avoided. Especially since many women feel uncomfortable during this period. Such women should rest more.

Sexual intercourse should be avoided during menstruation, as it may also transmit germs. However, its danger is not as serious as commonly imagined.

### The Battle Between Humans and Germs (10)

— Qiao Shumin

Excerpted from "Infectious Disease Management"

Eradication of Harmful Insects

Insects that are most likely to transmit diseases are mainly: (1) flies (especially houseflies), (2) mosquitoes (especially malarial mosquitoes), (3) lice (especially body lice), and (4) fleas (especially rat fleas). They reproduce in large numbers in the natural world, making it difficult for us to completely eradicate them at present. However, by following the methods below, we can achieve a significant inhibitory effect.

A. Eradicating Flies - The breeding grounds of flies are mainly human and animal feces, as well as garbage and filth containing decaying plants. The best strategy for eradicating flies is to prevent their breeding and eliminate their larvae. As for preventing and eradicating adult flies, it is more difficult.

(1) Preventing Fly Breeding and Eliminating Larvae

(1) Centralized and rational disposal of human and animal excrement and garbage.

(2) Regular cleaning of excrement and garbage.

(3) Killing fly larvae.

B. Preventing and Eradicating Flies

(1) Use screens, curtains, and covers to prevent flies from entering.

(2) Use fly swatters and flypaper to kill flies.

(3) Use chemicals to kill flies: such as DDT, pyrethrum, etc.

B. Eradicating Mosquitoes - Mosquitoes breed exclusively in places with water. However, there are many places with water, both in rural and urban areas, indoors and outdoors, making it extremely difficult to completely eradicate mosquitoes. However, the species of mosquitoes that can transmit diseases are not too numerous. In China, the *Anopheles* mosquito, which transmits malaria, is the main concern. The number of species already discovered varies from province to province, totaling twenty-four species and seven subspecies. The breeding grounds and living habits of various *Anopheles* mosquitoes differ. To eradicate *Anopheles* mosquitoes, one should first investigate which species of *Anopheles* mosquito is transmitting malaria in the local area, where its breeding grounds are, and what its habits are. Then, proceed with a planned eradication, so as not to work in vain and spend money with little effect.

There are many methods for eradicating mosquitoes. It is important to constantly assess the local situation and choose appropriate methods. The main points of mosquito eradication methods are as follows:

A. Preventing Mosquito Breeding and Eliminating Larvae

(1) Draining stagnant water.

(2) Filling in depressions and covering water storage containers.

(3) Killing mosquito larvae: using chemical agents.

B. Preventing and Eradicating Adult Mosquitoes

(1) Use mosquito nets, screens, and curtains to prevent mosquitoes from entering. A mesh with sixteen holes per inch is sufficient to prevent *Anopheles* mosquitoes.

(2) Use mosquito swatters to kill mosquitoes, or use livestock as a decoy - some *Anopheles* mosquitoes prefer the blood of livestock to human blood.

(3) Use chemicals to kill or repel mosquitoes: such as DDT, etc.

C. Eradicating Lice - Lice are external parasites of the human body and can transmit diseases such as relapsing fever, typhus, and trench fever. If we can bathe and change clothes frequently and maintain cleanliness, lice will not be able to establish themselves on the human body. However, due to the poor socio-economic conditions in general, the difficulty of water supply in the southwest, northwest, Mongolia, and Tibet, and the difficulty of maintaining cleanliness in some military units and prisons, lice are very common. Improving cleanliness is a fundamental solution. Methods for eradicating lice as a temporary measure can be divided into two categories: head lice and body lice.

A. Eradicating Head Lice

(1) Shave the hair.

(2) Comb to remove fleas - Lice eggs adhere to the hair. They can first be washed with diluted borax water or Lysol to eliminate them.

(3) Use chemicals to kill them - D.D.T. preparations are very effective.

B. Eradicating Body Lice - Body lice attach themselves to clothing and bedding. After bathing and changing into new clothes, the body will be free of lice. However, bedding and other items should be treated to kill insects to avoid future problems. Generally, heat or chemicals are used to kill them.

C. Eradicating Fleas - Among fleas, rat fleas are the most dangerous. To eradicate rat fleas, rats should also be exterminated at the same time (see previous section) for effective results. DDT preparations can be used to eradicate fleas, with very good results.

Enhancing Resistance

It is difficult to completely suppress the source of infectious diseases. The routes of transmission may not all be cut off, especially for respiratory infectious diseases. Therefore, enhancing the body's resistance is the last and most important line of defense for us to overcome germs. This can be divided into two categories: strengthening general resistance and developing specific resistance.

(9) Strengthening General Resistance - Improving Nutrition and General Health

A. Resisting the Invasion of Germs - We already know that the main routes of germs invading the human body are the mucous membranes, skin, and insect vectors. The skin can be kept intact, and insects do not belong to the human body, so there is no need to discuss them. Only the mucous membranes (respiratory tract, digestive tract, etc.) are always the main gates for germs to invade. How can we prevent and block them, so that germs cannot establish themselves on the mucous membranes or penetrate the mucous membranes and invade? Unfortunately, people's research in this area is still insufficient. What is known is that good nutrition, especially a sufficient amount of vitamin A, is related to the local resistance of the mucous membranes, and the removal of lesions (such as tonsillitis, etc.) is sufficient to restore the original reduced resistance of the mucous membranes.

Spring and Autumn

### English Translation of Fan Chengda's Poems

— Zhao Jingshen

Fan Chengda's "Four Seasons of Rural Life," a collection of sixty poems by the Southern Song pastoral poet, has recently been translated into English by Gerald Bullett. The small book is titled "The Golden Year of Fan Cheng-Ta," published by Cambridge University Press in England, and is said to be "a translation of Chinese agricultural procedures into rhyming English poetry." Because the original poems are arranged in seasonal order, with twelve poems each for rural life in spring, late spring, summer, autumn, and winter, and each poem is a seven-character quatrain. It is accompanied by annotations by Zhu Xi (? Tsui Chi) and calligraphic decorations. Perhaps the original Chinese text or titles were also written by Zhu Xi and printed using a plate? A. Waley's translation of Li Bai's poems adds the Chinese titles on the side.

Fan Chengda served as the prefect of Mingzhou in the twelfth century, which is now Yinxian County in Zhejiang. The reviewer for the London Times Literary Supplement said that he had served as "the military governor of Sichuan, gathered many poets and employed them, and he himself was the greatest poet among them." That is probably confusing Fan Chengda with Lu You, isn't it? The article also said: "This was written by Fan Chengda at the age of sixty, when he retired from office and was in leisure." According to the preface to the poems: "In the Bingwu year of Chunxi, after a slight relief from a long illness, I returned to my old retreat in Lake Stone, and wrote poems based on events in the countryside," resulting in sixty poems throughout the year, titled "Four Seasons of Rural Life." The Bingwu year of Chunxi corresponds to 1186 in the Western calendar. He was born in 1126. According to the Western way of calculating age, he could be said to be sixty years old, while the Chinese way of calculating age would be sixty-one. This cannot be considered a mistake.

Bullett himself says that his translation of the poems is based on experience. He has introduced to the English-speaking world Fan Chengda's clear and beautiful textual paintings of the agricultural year. What he has introduced to them are the phenomena of the four seasons, the various residents and customs of the countryside. He speaks with great enthusiasm and sincerity, and he focuses more on food than English and American pastoral poets.

Because of Fan Chengda's meticulous study of nature, he created his extraordinary poetic style. The reviewer believes that it is impossible not to introduce a little of it. Fan Chengda can turn anything into delightful poetic material. The following poem can serve as a representative work of Chinese agricultural life:

"In the midst of many acres of lotus flowers,

I row my boat, releasing the oars.

What obscures the path is a pile of flowers,

Until evening I forgot to go home.

The people waiting there are very clear

Although they cannot see where the boat is.

There, they always look there,

A small water bird suddenly startled and flies up."

In fact, these eight lines of poetry are only four lines in the original Chinese, found in the tenth of the "Rural Life in Summer" poems:

"Thousands of acres of lotus, I loosen the oars and play,

Flowers deep, I lose my way, forgetting to return late.

My family knows where the boat is going,

Sometimes there are startled little ducks flying."

Not long after the May Fourth Movement, Ye Shaojun, Gu Jiegang, and Wang Boxiang, three people from Suzhou, jointly compiled a textbook for introductory Chinese language (this is what is called Suzhou people speaking Mandarin, a joke). They first selected more than ten poems from Fan Chengda's sixty poems, breaking the former practice of only selecting classical prose. Later, people followed suit, and various textbooks adopted them, so middle school students also had the opportunity to appreciate the poems of this pastoral poet. Now that Bullett has translated them into English, it can be said that the poems of Lake Stone have become more widespread, and even English and American people know about them. Because before this, A. Waley's translation of "One Hundred and Seventy Poems," H. Giles's translation of "Gems of Chinese Literature," and Fletcher's translation of "Selections from Tang Poetry" and "Further Selections from Tang Poetry" all paid special attention to poets of the Tang Dynasty and before, and rarely paid attention to Fan Chengda.

### On Simple Living

— Xi Xi

A thesis was published in the bustling city of Paris in the late nineteenth century, specifically discussing simple living. At that time, it was already felt that world civilization had gone too far, and to return to simple living was simply foolish and insensitive. However, the author of this book thought otherwise. According to his meaning, simplicity is the practice of moving towards the highest goal of life, and not running counter to reality. Modern life, from the moment of birth to the moment of death, is constantly in intense tension, binding itself. Even games have no true joy, and even death cannot be peaceful. Especially the wealthy class is driven and manipulated by vanity, ambition, and abnormal enjoyment, which is truly pitiful. It is true that one must struggle for food and clothing, but what is the purpose of bustling and disturbing oneself beyond what is necessary? He put forward several items: simple thoughts, simple words, simple desires, simple entertainment, and simple aesthetics. It is truly like a clear, sweet, and gentle spring gushing out in the street of paper drunk and gold obsessed, washing away people's dusty feelings.

Who is the author? Charles Wagner. He was born in 1852 in Alsace, which was later merged by Germany and then returned. He was raised in a religious family, in a beautiful natural environment. He himself often said that wild flowers, mountain birds, white stones, and flowing springs were the fishing grounds of his childhood that he could never forget. He lost his father early, and at the age of fourteen went to Paris to study. After graduating, he went to Germany for further studies and was greatly influenced by German philosophers. After the annexation of Alsace, he devoted himself to French language and literature. He was engaged in religious education, lecturing, and writing throughout his life, diligently and tirelessly. His profound observations benefited from the experience of suddenly entering the city from the countryside in his childhood, and his sincere sympathy benefited from his inherited faith. Therefore, his discussion of the various falsehoods, changes, obsessions, and sufferings in the human world has a keen understanding, and he expresses it with a gentle and honest nature, issuing kind and moving exhortations, not arbitrarily criticizing people, but giving people lively warmth. He sympathized with the working class and was suspected of organizing and gathering workers, but he did not believe that opposing forces could not be reconciled. He once had the following famous saying:

"I am very fortunate that in my soul, I can reconcile many seemingly opposing forces into one. I live with the poor and the rich, the wise and the foolish, the city people and the villagers, the believers and the atheists, the Germans and the French, the people of the past and the people of the present. I understand them all, and I love them all equally."

In the preface to this masterpiece, he said:

"Those who suffer from fever dream of immersing themselves in the joy of a sweet spring. Modern life is so tense and disturbed that one should also dream of simple living. Simple living is not created by the external environment, nor is it a thing of the past. Rather, it can be a more lively and varied life, so it can be taken as the highest goal of life. Although our way of life is different from our ancestors, the spirit is the same. What exactly are people seeking in life? Today is still the same as yesterday! It is a pity that we are misled by divergent paths, resulting in self-inflicted troubles."

In his first chapter, discussing the troubles of the dusty world, he has a very humorous description.

"A certain lady is scheduled to get married on Tuesday. Today is already Friday. Tailors, dressmakers, house decorators, caterers, jewelry sellers, all kinds of people, are coming and going. It is hard to arrange things properly, and then you have to rush to change clothes and attend various ceremonies and banquets. (According to French customs, there are things similar to our old customs, such as betrothal gifts, etc.) Returning late at night, exhausted, there is another pile of letters waiting to be opened. Some are congratulatory, some say that the things entrusted are too late, and some say that it is difficult for the best man or master of ceremonies to fulfill their duties. There are various kinds of letters, enough to make one laugh, and enough to make one hesitate. This situation has been going on for almost a month, and there is simply no moment of peace and rest. Alas! Isn't this living in hell? Fortunately, the old grandmother is nearly eighty years old. She has her own bedroom, and she has suffered all the troubles of life and can now sit quietly to spend her remaining years. The chaos of this family temporarily disappears at the door of her room. Because everyone is afraid of disturbing her old lady, they have to speak and walk quietly. A pair of newlyweds finally managed to hide in the old lady's room, only then breathing a sigh of relief. The old lady said: "Poor children! You are too tired. Rest for a while, talk to each other, don't worry about those meaningless things, they are not worth it. This world is too complicated, it cannot add happiness to people, it only makes people more worried! "These words truly make the pair of newlyweds feel like they have been awakened by a morning bell. Indeed, in the past few days, they almost affected their love for a trivial matter, and it was not just once!

Who can not sympathize with the pain of the couple who are getting married and are entangled in the customs of vanity?

### Feng Menglong's "Extensive Collection of Jokes"

— Fu Jun

There are indeed many joke books in our country since ancient times. Starting from the earliest two joke books: "Laughing Forest" by Handan Chun of the Later Han Dynasty and "Record of Opening Smiles" attached to Hou Bai, there have been more than dozens of them up to the present. However, among these dozens of joke books, Feng Menglong's "Extensive Collection of Jokes" of the Ming Dynasty is the most impressive. Whether in terms of compilation or the selection of materials, Feng Menglong's joke book is the most in line with our ideals.

Feng Menglong's pen name is Mo Han Xiao Zhuren. The Jinxia Pavilion edition of "Extensive Collection of Jokes" is signed with this name. It is listed as the seventh kind of the first collection of the National Studies Treasure Text Library, published in the 25th year of the Republic of China. The preface to "Extensive Collection of Jokes" says: "From ancient times to the present, it is all talk, and talk is all laughter. The mixed beginnings and opening of the two instruments, the abdication and conquests of the successive sages, who sees them? It is also just talk. Later talk about the present is just like present talk about the past. To talk about it and doubt it is laughable. To talk about it and believe it is also laughable. The history of the canonical texts is ghost talk, and they are competing to spread it. Poems and essays are light talk, and they are competing for excellence. Praise, criticism, expansion, and suppression are chaotic talk, and they are competing to advance. Some laugh at people, some are laughed at by people. Those who laugh at people are also laughed at by people, and those who are laughed at by people also laugh at people. When will people stop laughing at each other? "Extensive Collection of Jokes" is a collection of jokes. Thirteen volumes are still considered thin. If you read it and like it, please don't like it. If you read it and get angry, please don't get angry. Yao and Shun, you abdicate the throne. I laugh at Tang and Wu, you seize the throne. He said that there was no one nearby to watch. If you see through this meaning, it is just a small business at the crossroads. What are Long Bi, Peng Gan, Yi He, and Lu? What are Chao Fu, Xu You, Yi, and Qi? Just like this chattering, I don't have the time to laugh at you. I laugh at Lao Tzu's five thousand words of Tao Te Ching, I laugh at Sakyamuni's five thousand volumes of text. It only provokes those Taoist priests to beat the cloud gongs, and the monks to beat the wooden fish, making a poor living. What kind of green ox reason and white ox taste have they ever had? Strangely, it provokes that Dharma old stinky Hu to chew and chew and wash and wash these dregs of dried dung. I also laugh at that old man Confucius, you chatter about what is thorough learning and writing, and you also kill many living people for nothing. I also laugh at Zhang Daoling and Xu Jingyang, even if you ascend to heaven in broad daylight, what is the use? These unfinished spirits in the end are just a bunch of wronged ghosts. Stop, stop, stop! There is also a great laughing palace of the ancient and modern world. You and I are all in it as talking points. Without talking, one cannot become a person. Without laughing, one cannot become talk. Without laughing, talking cannot become a world. The Laughing Buddha, my teacher, my teacher, inscribed by the Mo Han Zhai master."

"Extensive Collection of Jokes" is divided into fourteen volumes. The first thirteen volumes are jokes, and the last volume is called "Hidden Talk," which is "riddles," and is actually an appendix to the book. Volume 1, "Confucian Admonitions," contains 49 articles; Volume 2, "Official Admonitions," contains 27 articles; Volume 3, "Nine Schools," contains 23 articles; Volume 4, "Beyond the World," contains 15 articles; Volume 5, "Appetite," contains 68 articles; Volume 6, "Romantic Feelings," contains 24 articles; Volume 7, "Greed and Swallowing," contains 9 articles; Volume 8, "Emphasis on Temperament," contains 25 articles; Volume 9, "Bias and Rebuttal," contains 38 articles; Volume 10, "Mockery and Teasing," contains 41 articles; Volume 11, "Satirical Admonition," contains 19 articles; Volume 12, "Physical Form," contains 16 articles; Volume 13, "Miscellaneous Records," contains 9 articles; Volume 14, "Hidden Words," contains 39 articles. Except for Volume 14, "Hidden Words," which are "riddles" and cannot be said to be jokes, the thirteen volumes contain a total of 363 jokes. The longest jokes have as many as eighty or ninety characters per article, and the shortest are only about ten or twenty characters.

Concise wording and natural grammar are the characteristics of "Extensive Collection of Jokes." And every time we read an article, we not only smile, but also feel a strong sense of irony. Here are a few examples:

"A new official took office and asked the clerks: How should I do my job as an official? He said: Be clean in the first year, half-clean in the second year, and mixed in the third year. The official sighed and said: How can I manage to get to the third year?" (Volume 2, Official Admonitions, Article 12, "New Official Taking Office Practice")

"An official's birthday was celebrated. The clerks heard that he was born in the year of the rat, so they pooled gold to cast a rat as a birthday gift. The official was pleased and said: Do you know that my wife's birthday is also coming soon? My wife was born in the year of the ox." (Volume 2, Official Admonitions, Article 26, "Born in the Year of the Ox")

"A newly married woman was crying sadly on the way. The sedan chair carrier couldn't bear it and said: Little lady, how about I carry you back? The woman replied: I'm not crying anymore!" (Volume 6, Romantic Feelings, Article 15, "Not Crying")

"When a woman first left her boudoir, she was crying sadly. The sedan chair carrier couldn't find the carrying pole, so he cried and said: My lady, the carrying pole is in the corner of the door!" (Volume 6, Romantic Feelings, Article 17, "Finding the Carrying Pole")

After reading these jokes, how can we not say "If you read it and get angry, please don't get angry"?

Therefore, in my opinion, many of the short and concise jokes in Feng Menglong's "Extensive Collection of Jokes," when compared with modern so-called Western humor, are really no less than it.

### Poetry and Reality

### An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of River, an Inch of Blood 93

— Ye Jingfeng

What to do? After a little thought, I immediately ran to the car park, trying to find a small rope or something; I was going to twist the gunpowder from the pistol bullets into the rope to make a fuse, like the fuses the locals used to light beeswax. Although it wasn't possible to accurately calculate the exact moment of combustion, it would have to do. I didn't expect that after searching and searching, I just couldn't find such a thing. I hurriedly signaled, calling Hu also to help me find it.

Who knew that just as my younger brother Hu ran over, I suddenly heard the loudspeaker "dong, dong," sound a few times. Just as it was making a strange sound, shouting "ah, euh," at the same time, several searchlights suddenly shot out from the top of the multi-story building. The barracks on the eastern side opposite also began to stir, and in addition to the sounds of people, there were also the sounds of dogs, as if there were more than ten dogs howling softly. What was especially hateful was that wailing, ghost-like alarm, also sounded. Fortunately, none of those searchlights shone on us here.

In fact, we only needed to release one or two cans of gasoline to cause a big fire. But I hated the Japanese devils so much in my heart; I thought that wasting one more pool of their oil would also make their hearts ache even more. I didn't know that in doing so, we also wasted at least twenty minutes of our precious time. With these twenty minutes, we could have taken our time, probably done everything, and left already. But what was the use of regretting it now?

Once this alarm sounded, even the most experienced people would inevitably feel a bit frightened. In this critical moment, we absolutely couldn't make a wrong move. If we were confused, perhaps we would really have to grab a car, fire a gun, and rush out. But it hadn't reached that point yet, so I still calmed down, thought for a while, and used my eyes and ears to find out the direction of their search.

"Little Aunt, why are you looking for that rope? ... There are a lot of rags here, twist them into strips, ...

This child's mind was so agile, and his thoughts were so clear, it was really adorable. However, he didn't know that rope burns easily and is not easy to extinguish. A rope twisted from strips of cloth, even with gunpowder, would either burn too fast or easily go out; but it was still the only way, we could try it. Within three minutes, we made the fuse, picked the most suitable place, and set it up. A small pile of gunpowder was also piled up at the end of the rope. Seeing that everything was arranged properly, I took out my lighter and lit the fuse. I looked at my watch, it was exactly 10:05.

"Let's go!" I pointed to the west. I estimated that crossing the coal heap, traversing a section of open space, drilling through the jungle, crossing the road, going over the stone wall, and crossing that stream would take at least ten minutes.

"Halt ... Add!" Just as we were about to move, we suddenly heard a coarse and brutal voice shouting from behind us, like thunder.

The actions of the Japanese were probably almost always "deceptive." Looking here, the searchlights were all concentrated on the front of the building; the people, dogs, row after row, team after team, also walked forward along the road to the front, thinking that they were targeting the front of this garrison area, conducting a search. Although they activated all the alarm search equipment - searchlights, loudspeakers, alarm horns, people, dogs, etc., we still thought that the Japanese always liked to make a fuss over nothing, so we still concentrated on working here; who knew that this thing would pop out from here?

As soon as I heard the shout, my younger brother Hu and I immediately drew our guns and turned around. Who knew that the guy had a hand-held machine gun.

### Cold

— Shao Fu

The season has entered early winter, and the signs of cold are gradually spreading. Thinking of this year's snowy season, my heart is heavy, and I fear there will be no shortage of problems.

Shanghai is blessed by nature, and a woolen sweater and an overcoat are enough to cope with the cold here. However, in Peiping, which is still within the pass but not the coldest area, the temperature is already four degrees below zero. As for beyond the pass, and in another month, it is truly unimaginable!

Can those of us in warmth extend a hand to help our compatriots shivering in the wind and snow? This year's winter relief efforts will not be small in scope. We must prepare as soon as possible, because by the time people are frozen stiff, relief will be too late.

The sudden cold is particularly stimulating. These past two days, when people meet, their greetings are almost unanimously, "It's so cold!" But in a few days, everyone will get used to it. This phenomenon certainly illustrates the human capacity to adapt to the environment, but it also shows the frightening power of habit formed over time.

For the timid and the lazy, it is a threat and a terror, leading to prostration, regression, decline, and inaction. But for the brave and self-reliant, it is an encouragement, a spur, and a stimulus from nature.

### The Enemy of Secret Radio Stations: Radio Wave Detection Machines

— Mai Ye

The top headline on the city news page of this newspaper on the 21st of last month reported that the Songhu Garrison Headquarters recently used a small radio wave detection machine to uncover an illegal secret radio station on Jiangning Road.

Everyone knows that radio waves are merely vibrations in the "ether" that fills the universe, invisible to the eye and intangible to the touch. So, how does a "radio wave detection machine" actually detect them? The principle is easy to understand, but first, we must remember that what is usually detected is the transmitting station, not the receiving station. Fortunately, 90% of secret radio stations both receive and transmit. When they are transmitting, the "radio wave detection machine" can track the source of the radio waves like a hunting dog and eventually find the location of the transmitting station—or, more precisely, detect the location of the "antenna" connected to the transmitter. The "antenna" of a secret radio station may be disguised as a regular radio antenna, extending outdoors or on the roof, but it may also be hidden indoors, what is called an "indoor antenna."

Readers may recall how different radios were fifteen years ago, when radio broadcasting first appeared. At that time, the loudspeaker was not hidden inside the radio, and the antenna used, in addition to the current "outdoor antenna," also included the then-popular "indoor antenna," which consisted of a long copper wire wound around a small cross, looking rather like a spider web or our unique "Bagua Diagram." This ring-shaped "indoor antenna" had a certain mystery, because the cross was mounted on an "axis" that could be rotated left and right, so that the "Bagua Diagram" could easily be turned to face any direction of the compass. However, we must note that when rotating its direction, for a particular broadcasting station or transmitter, it only faces in one direction that the music or Morse code heard is clearest and loudest. Why? Because (according to the direction that the antenna is facing), with the location of the receiver as the origin, if one draws a straight line in the same direction on a map, then the broadcasting station or transmitter is on that straight line. The principle of the "radio wave detection machine" is similar.

However, using only one antenna and one receiver can only give a rough idea of where the broadcasting station or transmitter is located. In other words, at this time, one can only know that the transmitting station is on a straight line drawn on the map. Whether it is in front or behind, to the left or right of the receiving station is still unknown, because front and back, or left and right, are all on the same straight line. Thus, it is still impossible to tell exactly "which point" (location) on that "infinitely long" straight line the secret radio station is located.

The complete solution to the problem is very easy: simply set up a second receiving station and an antenna whose direction can be changed. Relying on the same principle, the direction of the strongest radio wave is searched for by the second antenna, and a straight line is drawn on the map through the base point of the second receiving station. The two straight lines will definitely not be "parallel." Then, according to the principles of geometry, these two lines must have an "intersection point," and the "intersection point," that is, the center of "X," is the location of the secret radio station!

Simply put, the so-called "radio wave detection machine" actually only includes an antenna whose direction can be rotated, and a receiver that is somewhat similar to a regular radio, except that in addition to the "earpiece," that is, the "headphones," it also has an extremely precise and sensitive "microammeter." From the pointer on this meter, one can see which direction the antenna is rotated that the received radio signal is strongest, thereby inferring in which direction the secret radio station is located.

Most "radio wave detection machines" used for detection have a set of instruments and an antenna installed in a small car, so it can move. Before going out to detect, the first step is to discover the "wavelength" of the secret radio station, because every legal radio station has a "wavelength" designated by the authorities, which cannot be changed privately. Also, the "wavelength" of each station is different. If the agency responsible for investigating illegal radio stations hears a radio wave "wavelength" on the receiver that is not on the registration list, it must immediately "track" it. Second, every legal radio station has a unique "call sign," just as every person has a different name, and this "call sign" is also designated by the telecommunications authority. According to regulations, the transmitting station must state its "call sign" several times at the beginning or end of a telegram to comply with international procedures. If one hears a radio station that does not "introduce itself" in this way by stating its name (i.e., "call sign"), it is undoubtedly an illegal radio station, and further "tracking" is necessary.

The "radio wave detection machine" is dispatched to investigate suspicious radio stations. Usually, two or three "detection machines" are dispatched separately, and they communicate with each other at any time using short-range small radios, because this can "achieve twice the result with half the effort." There are also some in which several radio wave detection machines and several rotating antennas are installed in the same small car. However, whether the car is equipped with one or more sets of instruments, the exterior of the car looks no different from ordinary cars.

Precise and skilled detection can sometimes uncover the location of a secret radio station in a matter of minutes, not only knowing the street, lane, and house number clearly, but also easily detecting on which floor of that building, in the front hall or the back pavilion, the secret radio station is hidden. The secret lies in changing the "angle of elevation" of the "detection machine's" antenna to obtain this information.

Besides the "radio wave detection machine" mentioned above that detects illegal radio stations, the use of this principle also includes guiding ships into port in thick fog by using radio wave direction, or informing lost aircraft of their location, and even guiding them to safely return to base.

It is said that the United States used many aircraft without pilots controlled by radio waves in its two atomic bomb tests on coral reefs. The ability of these squadrons of aircraft to fly back to base was also achieved by using radio signals to guide their direction. Also, the principle of "radar," one of the new weapons of World War II, is partly similar to the "radio wave detection machine" described here.

Abandoning Politics to Focus on Art

News Figures

### Abandoning Politics to Focus on Art: Zhang Daofan, Disciple of Qi Baishi

— Fan Fu

Mr. Zhang Daofan, Director of the Central Cultural Movement Committee, recently announced that he would abandon political activities to concentrate on art, and became a disciple of the famous painter Qi Baishi. Zhang Daofan, courtesy name Weizhi, is a native of Ran County, Guizhou. At the age of twenty, he left his hometown to study in Tianjin. In the eighth year of the Republic of China (1919), with the help of his uncle, he studied in England. At that time, Zhang was twenty-three years old. He initially studied literature in England, and later switched to calligraphy and painting, obtaining a diploma from the Fine Arts Department of the University of London. He then went to the National School of Fine Arts in France and participated in the famous "Paris Spring Art Exhibition" with his works.

After returning to China, Zhang's political career began immediately. At that time, the Chinese art world was still in a state of decline, making it difficult to develop his art. Not being able to practice his art was a last resort. From being the secretary of the Agricultural and Industrial Department of Guangdong Province to being the secretary and deputy minister of the Central Organization Department, the Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, and to his current position, twenty years have passed. During that time, he assisted Mr. Chen Lifu in promoting party affairs, which was very effective.

Mr. Zhang is humble and sincere, a cultured artist. It is said that Zhang once wrote two scripts, "Self-Help" and "Self-Mistake," and solicited criticism from all walks of life. One young student wrote to Zhang, pointing out the errors in the script, concluding that Zhang was not qualified to talk about spoken drama. Zhang replied, acknowledging that the student's comments were insightful and deeply ashamed. He then published an advertisement in the newspaper, asking the student to provide his contact information so that he could ask for advice. After a month, he finally received a reply, but only if Zhang showed his sincerity would the student comply. Zhang wrote a letter according to the student's wishes, and the student then provided his address, requesting only written communication and refusing to meet. Zhang respected the student's opinion and successively mailed the written scripts to the student, who annotated them with his own opinions and mailed them back. Zhang adopted many of these suggestions. Later, he learned that the student was a poor and hard-working young man, so Zhang sent a large sum of money to help him, expressing his gratitude and encouragement.

Mr. Zhang not only understands Cantonese, but is also proficient in French. His wife is also a French lady. Zhang has a daughter named Liyun, who is seventeen years old this year, and is much loved by Zhang.

During his twenty years in politics, Mr. Zhang never ceased to care about the situation in the cultural world, and often maintained contact. In the midst of his busy schedule, he also stole time to write scripts and other literary works. Mr. Zhang is emotional and possesses a broad-mindedness that is lacking in many artists. In reason, he is more suited to being an artist.

Mr. Zhang's actions today are a loss in the political sense, but a welcome gain in the cultural world.

### Talking About KISS

— Jiang Pingqing

I have searched through all the unofficial histories, anecdotes, and legends of China, seeking to find the character for "kiss," but they are as rare as morning stars. I have checked the vocabulary of modern novels, and while the character exists, it is not common. Not only that, but even if I were to wear an invisibility cloak and actually investigate the romantic behavior of Chinese men and women, apart from the occasional lazy kiss between couples hiding and dodging, or the bolder performances between adulterers and adulteresses in the lower classes, open and frank expressions of kissing are rarely seen. Even in the "kiss repository" of movies, one would expect to see a real performance, but alas, it is still just a trick of the camera! Very few Chinese films have kissing scenes, and these are influenced by foreign films.

Most Chinese people regard Confucius's precepts as sacred mottoes. Emotions must still be tempered by propriety and righteousness. Since ancient times, men and women should not touch each other's hands, let alone their mouths? If we were to point out a semi-enlightened young girl now and tell her to go herself, no! To see, no! To hear that a certain couple, at a banquet or on the sidewalk, press their lips together and make a "smack" sound, oh my! She would be so ashamed! So ashamed that her earlobes would blush all the way to her jaw!

Chinese romance is accustomed to the exchange of spiritual and mental longings. Even when they meet, they remain aloof, welcoming and rejecting each other. The most used physical feature is the eyes, and the most expressed posture is the smile. (The Chinese only have "spending a thousand gold pieces to buy a smile," but not "spending a thousand gold pieces to buy a kiss.") Everything is a transmission of souls and a connection of spirits. This noble and pure path is not to be compared with the rough-hewn style of the West.

In the lyrics of our Li Houzhu, there is a line: "Chewing the red velvet, she smiles and spits it out to her lover!" Just this one line! Look! The charm in this line is enough for you to describe in what way? Enough for you to savor how many times? Its meaning, its delicacy, its liveliness, is it something that you mechanically embracing, hugging, kissing and kissing, kissing and kissing, can compare to?

But in the books of our country, it is not impossible to find a word similar to kiss, "Let me have a whiff!" This word "whiff" is the broad sense of the word kiss, because I can sniff your cheeks, sniff your temples, or sniff at the hairline and eyebrows, but our sniff is from man to woman, not woman to man; (alas, there is no beautiful woman who will automatically come to sniff our stinky men!) Sniff! Sniff! I suddenly thought of the ugliness of the two fools pursuing Qiuxiang in Mr. Cheng Zhanlu's "The Tale of the Four Talents of Tang, Zhu, Wen and Zhou," and I couldn't help but burst into laughter.

The Story of the Psychoanalyst

### The Innocent Murderer 3

— Xu Guiting

When Luson first met Mi En, his behavior was very strange. He took out a golden cigarette case from his pocket and said to Mi En, "I stole this from a shop on Regent Street. I suddenly liked this thing, so I stole it. Didn't you know I would steal things?"

Mi En nodded and said, "Oh, I knew that. The cane you're holding is the 'poker' from my place. You accidentally took it away."

"Really?" Luson's face turned red, and he said awkwardly, "I swear, I have one of those at home too."

"Forget it. It's getting late. I want to know some things about you. Are your parents still alive?" "They're both dead." "Please tell me more about it." "My father was a lawyer." Luson paused, closed his eyes, and then laughed absentmindedly before continuing, "My mother was his wife."

The next day, Mi En returned the cigarette case that Luson stole to a shop on Regent Street.

The next time, Luson came again. Mi En took a syringe from the medicine cabinet, filled it with saline, and said to him, "I want to get you to talk more, so I'll quickly inject you with this saline. After the injection, you will feel slightly dizzy, but you may not fall asleep immediately."

So, Mi En injected Luson. Then, Mi En counted one, two, three, four... until seventy, Luson began to get confused. The psychoanalyst calmly urged him to speak, saying, "Hey! Talk! The last time, you were piloting the Spitfire, and below were the Japanese devils. So, what happened?"

Upon hearing this, Luson suddenly shouted loudly, "It's on fire! I must calm down, calm down. I have to parachute down. I don't know how long I stayed on top of the tree. After waking up, I climbed down at great risk. Somehow, I lost consciousness. When I regained consciousness, I opened my eyes and saw many Japanese devils surrounding me. I don't know how they suddenly appeared. A burly devil struck my waist with the butt of a gun, and I fell down. Later, they took my water bottle and wouldn't give me a drop of water. They were still surrounding me, grinning non-stop. At that time, I passed out again.

"When I woke up, the Japanese interpreter smiled at me, and then gave me a cigarette. He said that he had lived in London for five years. I found his condescending attitude unbearable. He always asked me, asking all sorts of irrelevant questions, such as how old I was, whether I was married, and so on. Later, two other devils got impatient with the questioning. One punched me in the face, and the other hit my waist with the butt of his gun. I screamed and fell down again. I really couldn't take it anymore, so I finally told them."

Mi En immediately asked, "You told them what?"

Luson held his face in his hands, his whole body trembling, and stuttered, "Our air force unit, where it was stationed, where it came from, our mission, our activities, everything."

His voice grew louder and louder, eventually becoming a shrill scream. He ended up passing out, burying his head in the sofa and crying bitterly. Mi En quickly comforted him, saying, "It's okay, have some water."

After a while, Luson woke up, looked around, and said, "What exactly did I say?" Mi En told him everything. He took a breath, smoked a cigarette, and continued to describe his terrifying experience:

"Later, those Japanese devils felt satisfied, but they still didn't let me go, fearing that I would escape. One morning, they walked into my shed. One of them was holding a wooden stick, and the other used a piece of wood to prop up one of my legs, and then struck my knee with it. Oh God! I screamed, and it was over." (To be continued)

National Assembly Inauguration Anniversary Special

### Wishing the National Assembly a Smooth Progression

— From Our Newspaper's Archives

The convening of the National Assembly was decided at the Political Consultative Conference in January of this year to be held in Nanjing on May 5th. The Central Government meticulously prepared, specially appointing Shao Lizi as the Chairman of the National Assembly Preparatory Committee. By mid-April, preparations were largely complete. The National Government issued an order for the assembly, stipulating that representatives from various regions should begin reporting from April 25th. Chairman Chiang invited the Comprehensive Group of the Political Consultative Conference to a tea party on April 15th, requesting that each party submit its list of National Assembly representatives by April 20th. However, by April 24th, the lists from the various parties had still not been submitted, and the Communist Party of China (CPC) representatives reiterated that they could not consider the matter. At 4 PM on the 24th, Chairman Chiang once again invited representatives from various parties of the Political Consultative Conference and prominent social figures to a tea party at the National Government to discuss the National Assembly issue and other related matters. As a result, in order to consider the facts and respect the opinions of the various parties, it was decided to temporarily postpone the session and, at the same time, hope that all parties would expedite the consultative work in order for the National Assembly to be held as soon as possible.

After the postponement order was issued, the first group of 130 National Assembly representatives who had already arrived in Nanjing initially expressed opposition, telegraphing Chongqing and arguing that even if the CPC and the Democratic League did not submit representatives, the National Assembly should still be held as scheduled. Subsequently, National Assembly representatives from various regions arrived in Nanjing one after another, unanimously striving for the National Assembly not to be postponed, and on May 1st, they convened a preparatory meeting on their own. More than 200 representatives attended, with Lin Hu from Guizhou Province serving as the temporary chairman, jointly expressing that even if the National Assembly was postponed, there should be a definite limit. On May 6th, government representative Shao Lizi hosted a tea party for the National Assembly representatives at the Central Auditorium, elaborating on the government's difficulties and sincerely persuading the representatives to share the burden. The representatives collectively raised criticisms. By May 13th, the National Assembly Preparatory Committee finally adjourned its session, accepting Chairman Chiang's advice and establishing a steering committee to study the draft constitution.

The National Assembly was postponed, but the timing of its convening was not decided at the time, leading to diverse speculations, with some saying it would be in early June, others saying it would be after the autumn coolness, with no consensus. It wasn't until July 3rd, at a meeting of the Supreme National Defense Council, that Chairman Chiang raised the issue of convening the National Assembly, seeking opinions. The majority believed that it could not be delayed any longer and had to be held on a fixed date, otherwise there would be no way to gain the trust of the people. Therefore, it was decided that the National Assembly would be held on November 12th. The method of convening it was decided to proceed in accordance with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. If representatives from some parties did not participate at that time, the National Assembly would still be held as scheduled, and there would be no further changes.

After the order to convene the National Assembly on a fixed date was issued, the CPC claimed that it had no prior knowledge and would not be bound by this decision in any way. However, the government, adhering to its consistent policy of returning power to the people, made every effort to hold peace talks before the convening of the National Assembly, hoping to reach an agreement. On the one hand, the preparatory work for the National Assembly was resumed. The National Assembly Election Office officially issued a notice on September 24th, urging various parties to submit their lists, with Zhang Lisheng's name affixed, requesting that the parties submit their lists by early October. The government decided to issue the National Assembly convocation order on October 2nd.

On September 28th, Chairman Chiang summoned Hong Lanyou, Secretary-General of the National Assembly Preparatory Committee, to inquire about the progress of the National Assembly's preparations. On the same day, the CPC delegation officially replied to the National Assembly Preparatory Committee, refusing to submit a list of representatives. According to the CPC's letter, "There is currently no constitution available for the National Assembly to discuss, therefore it is inconvenient to participate." The Democratic League also adopted the same stance as the CPC. On September 30th, Zhang Lan, Shen Junru, and eight others wrote to Chairman Chiang, believing that the National Assembly could only be convened after national peace was restored.

For the sake of thorough consideration, the convocation order, originally scheduled to be issued on October 2nd, was not issued until the 11th, when it was officially issued by the National Government's Secretariat, and simultaneously delivered to each representative, notifying them to convene as scheduled, reporting by November 2nd. After the convocation order was issued, the preparatory work in Nanjing suddenly became tense. The venue was being arranged day and night, and various reception methods were also finalized. The preparatory office specially established six reception centers to cope with the housing shortage in Nanjing. The national transportation lines also assisted in the work, providing representatives with transportation convenience.

At the same time, the Nanjing peace talks focused on the two themes of the National Assembly list and the ceasefire. The government side, in order to achieve constitutional government as soon as possible, urged the various parties to submit their lists of representatives as scheduled.

Representatives from various regions enthusiastically reported at the Social Service Center on Xin Jiekou in Nanjing from the 2nd. However, the lists of the CPC and various parties were still not submitted. The government authorities, in order to promote peaceful reunification and return power to the people, did not hesitate to make the greatest concessions. Therefore, on the 8th of this month, Chairman Chiang resolutely announced an order to stop the fighting of the national army inside and outside the pass! Wishing the National Assembly a smooth progress and the nation an unlimited future!

### Impressions of the National Assembly Reception Center

— Our Newspaper's Special Correspondent

The National Assembly Reception Centers are divided into five locations, the most beautiful of which is of course the Second Reception Center! That is, the original Overseas Chinese Reception Center. Painted beams and carved pillars, newly painted, the red is especially red, the green is especially green, bright and dazzling, with a bit of Beijing's atmosphere. In Nanjing, where the field atmosphere is too strong, this building adds some bright touches.

As soon as you enter the door, there are glass counters dedicated to representatives to buy small daily necessities, arranged in two rows on the left and right. The left row is full of "American equipment", toothpaste and toothbrushes are the most, followed by cigarettes, cigars, chocolate, and the like. There are also food boxes that Shanghai has allocated to public educators. As soon as you see it, you think of those United Shopping Centers in Shanghai, the only difference perhaps is that the price of things here is two or three percent more expensive than in Shanghai. The right row of counters is all domestic products, and there are fewer types of things, nothing more than socks and towels, but a small sign on the counter is very interesting, saying that these are all domestic products, and representatives can enjoy a 10% discount on the listed price. I think this boss is very smart, because many of the representatives who live in this reception center are overseas Chinese, who have competed with foreign businessmen abroad, and their psychology of loving domestic products is naturally particularly strong. However, the business on these two rows of counters is very deserted.

Each reception center has some temporary facilities for the convenience of the representatives, such as temporary post offices, telegram long-distance telephones, savings and remittances, and also accepts the representatives' entrustment to handle various matters - from booking hotel rooms to booking theater tickets. According to the staff of the reception center, this part of the work is the busiest. I may also mention a very good way to deliver letters here, which Shanghai can imitate in the future. That is, the temporary post office has set up a system of delivering letters by machine bicycles. Senders do not need to affix stamps. The post office sends postmen by machine bicycles to deliver them throughout the city several times a day. The postage is always paid by the reception center according to the weight.

However, if you want to visit a representative, it is not easy, because there are armed military police at every corner of the stairs, with a frosty look on their faces, which makes you retreat. It is useless to take out your business card, you must go downstairs to find the staff of the office to go up together. When the staff takes you up, the military police will salute you when you go up and salute you when you come down. Hu Shih and Fu Sinian are both National Assembly representatives. If they are asked to live in such a place, I don't know what they would think?

Each representative is given two towels by the conference, but there are no toothbrushes or toothpaste. The conference provides white porcelain washbasins and shoe shining services.

The representatives' rooms are like student dormitories, with five or six people living in each room, so there is not much room for maneuvering. There are also about 200 representatives living in the hotel, and the rooms are all booked by the reception center. If you live in the Central Hotel or the like, it will be a little more comfortable - so the staff of the reception center are on the phone all day long to ask for rooms from various hotels. At present, the total number of representatives living in various reception centers is about six or seven hundred.

The Central Political University of Hongzhilang is the first reception center. The road is narrow and uneven, and it is very uncomfortable to sit in the car. However, most of the representatives live here. Because the Overseas Chinese Reception Center is only for overseas Chinese representatives and regional representatives from Guangdong and Guangxi.

Mr. Zhu Pinsan, the person in charge of the reception center, said that when the representatives of various parties come, we still have houses, and we can immediately establish several more reception centers.

The representatives live in the same room with their fellow villagers in principle. Not many Shanghai representatives live in the reception center. In a very small room, I saw four or five rather fat representatives, all wearing sky blue satin robes and black vests, wearing leggings, shaving their heads, with mustache, and elegant salutes, it can be seen that they must have come from some country of etiquette.

There is only one overseas Chinese representative from South Korea, and he lives alone in a room. This old gentleman is Mr. Zhou Shenjiu, originally from Shandong, who has lived in South Korea for thirty or forty years. Talking about the oppression of overseas Chinese by the Japanese in the past, I can't help but feel emotional, but the current situation seems to be still somewhat far from ideal. The most noteworthy sentence is: The Japanese are still painstakingly trying to influence the local authorities, and they are doing everything they can. South Korea is now a US military defense zone, and the order is relatively good, but overseas Chinese are still in a state of being unattended - the delegation remains in North China and does not enter, and the consul general has not yet left.

Representatives spend more time going out to visit the capital during the day. The footprints of the National Assembly representatives are all over Nanjing City, and many restaurants and restaurants are posted with "National Assembly Representatives Special Restaurant". If we follow the example of "Victory Fast Food" and "New Fortune Rice", there should be "National Assembly Representative Rice". In fact, the set meal that the representatives eat in the reception center may be regarded as "National Assembly Representative Rice". If one person eats it, they can eat a stir-fried dish, a cold dish, and a soup, but the diameter of the pot for serving the dish probably does not exceed five inches. According to the meaning of the canteen boss, the business is very good, and the business may get better in the future.

Do you want to ask me about my impression of the National Assembly Reception Center? Very simple: the staff are extremely busy; the representatives are extremely idle. (13th)

### Mr. Lou Tongsun Discusses the Draft Constitution

— Our Newspaper's Special Correspondent

The emergence of the National Assembly is the harbinger of China's democratic politics. The guarantee of the democratic system in the future lies in the confirmation of the constitution. Therefore, a long time ago, many people have been enthusiastically discussing the issue of the draft constitution. The Legislative Yuan has been fiercely debating these days on how to revise or supplement the May 5th Constitution. On the one hand, Chairman Chiang has ordered the Legislative Yuan to submit the draft constitution within a limited time. Therefore, how to revise or supplement the May 5th Constitution is not only the focus of discussion among political figures, but also the concern of compatriots all over the country. Therefore, the reporter specially visited Mr. Lou Tongsun, the original drafter of the May 5th Constitution draft, to solicit his opinions on revising or supplementing the draft constitution. Mr. Lou met the reporter in his study with the calm attitude of a scholar and frankly stated his personal opinions on the revision of the draft constitution.

He said: The May 5th Constitution has been announced for ten years. It is true that due to the passage of time, there are inevitably some places that need to be readjusted. Especially regarding the section on provinces (Chapter 5, Section 1), not only are the articles simple (a total of only five articles), but the status and nature of the provinces are not very clear. Compared with the political situation at the time of drafting the articles, there have obviously been major changes in the current situation. In order to adapt to the current situation and implement the legacy of Sun Yat-sen's system of equal rights, there must be considerable revisions or supplements. We, the original drafters, can also frankly admit this. Other issues such as the appointment of the presidents of the Judicial and Examination Yuans, the complexity of the articles in the chapter on the national economy, especially Articles 129 and 130 at the end of the chapter, which in fact can be said to have lost their effect, and Article 143 in Chapter 8 regarding the transitional provisions on the method of generating legislators and supervisors, which should no longer exist, of course, all need to be revised, but the most important thing is that the basic principles and principles of the May 5th Constitution all strictly abide by Sun Yat-sen's legacy, have been carefully studied by the drafting committee of the Legislative Yuan for a long time, and have been publicly solicited from the people all over the country for their opinions before being announced by the National Government. For example, the organization and powers of the National Assembly are to make it truly become the organ for the people to exercise political power in the central government. Whether the president and the president of the Executive Yuan are actually held by one person or by two persons, they can only exercise one power - executive power - in the principle of the five-power constitution (so Article 56 stipulates that the president of the Executive Yuan is appointed and dismissed by the president). Although the forms of the five Yuans of administration, legislation, judiciary, examination, and supervision (whether to establish a Yuan or not) can be unfettered, they must be divided into five powers without any doubt. In recent years, a few contemporary sages have expressed many opinions on the powers of the president and the relationship between the Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan, and have proposed revised drafts. The main purpose is nothing more than to reduce the president's power, or even have no power at all, roughly equivalent to the president of France, and to make the Executive Yuan responsible to the Legislative Yuan, so that the Legislative Yuan is roughly equivalent to the lower house (House of Representatives) of the general national congress, and the Supervisory Yuan becomes the American-style Senate. In a word... All kinds of changes are nothing more than imitating the parliamentary politics of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, and using the cabinet system as the central idea of the design. Frankly speaking, this is far from the spirit of Sun Yat-sen's legacy. The difficult focus of our current constitution draft issue lies here.

Mr. Lou is a scholar, the original drafter of the May 5th Constitution, and a political figure who has witnessed the changes in China's political situation. His frank and sincere opinions are worthy of attention by contemporary sages who are enthusiastic about discussing the constitution and compatriots who are closely concerned about the constitution.

### Distinguished Guests in the Capital

— Our Newspaper's Special Correspondent

National Assembly representatives are now arriving in Beijing one after another to report and prepare for the meeting. The total number has reached more than 1,360, accounting for the majority of more than half of the total of 2,050. They come from different regions, represent different occupations, and even in terms of the representatives themselves, each has their own religious beliefs and lifestyle preferences. But one thing is common, that is, they are all figures who can live up to expectations and can speak for the people. These days, you can see these representatives wearing bright representative badges strolling the streets or visiting scenic spots everywhere in the capital, which can be described as "distinguished guests in the capital", a grand occasion for a while! After they arrive in Beijing, they enjoy convenience in almost all aspects of life. Many large stores also automatically posted the sign "Welcome National Assembly Representatives, Discounted Offers", willing to serve the representatives with low profits. Now let the author describe the lives of the representatives and observe them!

When the representatives arrive in Beijing, the first thing they will consider when they step off the transportation is the accommodation problem. "It is not easy to live in Beijing", this is something everyone knows. It is said that if the National Assembly were to be convened before the war, at least half of the representatives would live in their own private houses in Beijing or in the homes of relatives and friends in Nanjing. However, it is different now. The vast majority live in the reception centers prepared by the National Assembly Preparatory Committee. A total of five reception centers have been prepared. The first reception center is located in the Central Political School, which can accommodate more than 500 people. In order to accommodate the National Assembly representatives, the students of the Political School had to be assigned to various agencies for internships. The second reception center is in the Overseas Chinese Reception Center, which is the most magnificent and is mostly inhabited by overseas Chinese representatives. The third reception center is in Chengxian Street, which was temporarily set up by the National Assembly Preparatory Committee. The fourth reception center is in the YWCA, which can be said to be exclusively for female representatives. There is also a fifth reception center, which is located in the Land Administration Research Institute, which has a limited capacity. In total, these five reception centers can only accommodate more than 1,000 representatives. For the shortage, the Preparatory Committee has rented rooms in major hotels in the city as a supplement. Each reception center is equipped with waiters, clerks, health offices, entrusted agency offices, post offices, banks, telecommunications bureaus, reading rooms, stationery and magazine supply departments, laundry, sewing, and daily necessities supply departments. Even if the representatives want to shine their shoes, there is also a shoe shining department to serve them. As for the representatives who do not live in the dormitory, they can also receive a housing fee of 150,000 yuan.

The representatives' meals are also very convenient after arriving in Beijing. The Preparatory Committee provides meals from the day the representatives report to Beijing until five days after the closing of the conference. However, because the representatives have different provincial origins and different religious beliefs, it is also very inconvenient for the Preparatory Committee to prepare meals. Now the committee has agreed with 48 major restaurants in the capital that the representatives can go to eat at will with meal tickets. These 48 restaurants represent various flavors of Beijing, Cantonese, Sichuan, Halal, Pingjin, Suhu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Henan, Hunan, Fujian, vegetarian, and Western cuisine. One of them is the "Liu Huachun" Beijing restaurant in Confucius Temple, where Mrs. Chiang went to dine. Therefore, as long as you mention the three words "Liu Huachun" in the capital, there is no one who does not know this glorious history. It is said that the Mongolian and Tibetan representatives who have arrived in Beijing are not used to the dishes of these special restaurants and have taken care of their own meals.

Because the representatives live in different places, except for those who have private cars and can move freely, the rest of the representatives have to use the "National Assembly Special Car" to attend meetings and eat. These large special cars, a total of 60, are all painted in bright colors. As long as the representatives wear their badges, they can ride freely. There are also five traffic cars that stop at various places and run throughout the city, almost non-stop from 7:30 in the morning to 9:30 in the evening, making it very convenient to ride. The National Assembly Preparatory Committee has also ordered 20 small Jeep cars from Shanghai Xiang Sheng Company to be quickly transported to Beijing and parked near the reception centers of the representatives to provide services to the representatives at reduced fees. In this way, if the representative has any personal activities, they do not necessarily have to take the large special car.

Finally, I cannot but mention the staff of the National Assembly Preparatory Committee. The highest principle of their work is: "Everything is for the representatives". The scope of their work is: "All-inclusive". All things that can make the representatives comfortable and convenient are the responsibility of their preparation. According to the current count, the number of full-time transferred staff of the National Assembly has reached more than 1,000. They have never experienced such a big scene in their lives, and our country has never convened a large gathering of thousands of people, so that the current staff has an example to follow. Therefore, all preparations can only be done by imagination. Once it is found in fact that there is inconvenience, it will be modified again. This is commendable in the spirit of doing things, but whether many defects will occur after the opening of the National Assembly will have to be tested by future facts. (Letter)

### How the National Assembly is Prepared

— Our Newspaper's Special Correspondent

The preparation for the National Assembly, we have been counting from the 25th year as ten years, with the six postponements, the preparatory work is more and more tense, the scope of preparation is getting bigger and bigger, this time the preparatory work, the one of the 55th has laid the initial foundation, because of the postponement, there are six months of preparation, naturally perfect and thoughtful, we see: the meeting industry is so majestic and majestic, the reception is so comfortable and convenient, the action is so agile and fast, the scene is so solemn and great, the use of scientific mind, here fully shows the greatness of the Republic of China!

### Hu Shih Arrives in Nanjing

— Our Special Correspondent

According to Mr. Hu Shih, newspaper reporters are probably just busybodies who meddle in other people's affairs. He said, "The other day, a few of us flew to Daxiaochang Airport in Nanjing and were overjoyed to see that there wasn't a single reporter! We rushed to the registration desk to register, but to our surprise, there wasn't a single reporter at the National Assembly registration either! Later, we found out that you were all busy with your own affairs—trying to get entrance passes from the news group, weren't you?"

You see, if you look for him, he finds it a bother; if you don't, it seems like we reporters are being impolite. I secretly made up my mind: I'd stick to Mr. Hu like a "mushroom" for three hours!

Mr. Hu was wearing a long gown, looking very relaxed. He said that the National Assembly had given him three days off, and he was thinking of taking the time to read a rare edition of the "Commentary on the Water Classic." He politely took out a pack of newly opened Morris cigarettes to offer his guests. We politely declined, saying that we didn't smoke. Mr. Hu was very surprised and said, "A reporter who doesn't smoke? That's rare!"

Actually, everyone had cigarettes in their pockets.

Mr. Hu leaned comfortably on the sofa, smoke rings disappearing one by one in the quiet room, and leisurely began to talk about Peking University. Peking University officially started classes on November 4th, but the medical school had already started because it didn't have any returning students from the inland areas. This time, the new student entrance exam was announced a bit late, so the registration deadline was also a bit later, but now it's getting close, on the 15th."

Mr. Jing Xi published an article in the newspaper on Sunday entitled "Self-Funded Overseas Studies Must Not Be Restricted." Today, people are discussing this issue again, and I thought this was a question that Mr. Hu couldn't avoid answering, so I lightly brought it up.

Mr. Hu said he hadn't seen that article and didn't know what Mr. Wang had said. However, he did have some opinions on the matter of self-funded overseas studies.

He said that during the War of Resistance, self-funded students could apply for foreign exchange, and one US dollar was legally worth 20 yuan, so naturally, foreign living expenses seemed much lower than in China. Moreover, government-funded students could only apply for US$1,800 per year, while self-funded students could apply for US$2,400 per year, plus a travel allowance of US$2,000, totaling as much as US$4,400. As a result, everyone chose self-funded overseas studies, lived quite luxuriously, and didn't necessarily go to school, the main thing was to avoid military service. Mr. Hu said that when Germany surrendered, he was in the United States and saw self-funded students taking their whole families with them. Moreover, after Germany surrendered, gasoline became more readily available, and some of these self-funded students bought cars, bought black market gasoline, and had a great time in the United States. This situation was naturally not good.

However, Mr. Hu said that his usual view is that self-funded overseas studies should, in principle, not require an exam. If there is an exam, it must be very strict. Why? Because the qualifications for government-funded overseas study exams are very strict, requiring a university degree and two years of work experience, so the admitted students are mostly in their thirties. When a person reaches their thirties, their ability to learn languages is diminished.

Mr. Hu's conversation became more lively, and I listened quietly. I really wanted to smoke, but I was too embarrassed to. If a business card hadn't been delivered at that moment, Mr. Hu's conversation might not have been interrupted. The guest who came in was Mr. Zang Qifang, the white-bearded, spirited president of Northeastern University.

Mr. Hu said to Mr. Zang, "They are reporters. But they don't talk politics with me, so I'm very happy." Old Mr. Zang laughed and said, "That's right, how can you talk about politics!"

So, they continued to talk about overseas studies, and Mr. Zang became very interested.

Mr. Hu said, "Language is the most important tool for seeking knowledge. Government-funded students in their thirties, after going abroad, are sufficient in their academic fields. They get to know two or three professors and five or six classmates, and they busy themselves until they write a thesis. They don't care about the big events in society. They don't care about other people's social systems, general elections, or small elections. They are busy doing their thesis, seeking a doctoral or master's degree. In fact, the original intention of sending them out was not their degrees."

Mr. Zang completely agreed, saying that looking at other people's social systems is much more meaningful than focusing solely on getting a degree.

At this point, Mr. Hu started talking about the positive side of self-funded overseas studies. He advocated that self-funded students should be younger. He wanted to send young people around the age of twenty out so that they could study for a few more years. Because students around the age of twenty can learn languages well, and they will definitely develop a great interest in foreign culture, politics, and society. The impact they have after returning to China will be immeasurable. Therefore, if there are young children in the family who can be nurtured, it may be worthwhile to let them study at a domestic university for a year or two first, and then go to a foreign university as transfer students. People over the age of twenty-five really shouldn't learn languages anymore, and those who study sociology, literature, and history must also go abroad early.

Government-funded exams are strictly limited, and it's not easy for younger people to pass, so it's better to loosen up on self-funded students—but, of course, there will definitely be many drawbacks. Mr. Hu said that if there must be an exam, then it must be strict, at least to get good students.

Mr. Zang said that it's not good for overseas students to be unsupervised abroad, so should we send someone to supervise them?

Mr. Hu said, "Overseas student supervisors? No, no. The place is too big, you can't control them. Look, the United States is three thousand miles from east to west, and there are more than seven hundred universities, how can you supervise them? American universities are not managed by the government, students transfer from this school to that school, they do what they want, what can you do? Besides, setting up overseas student supervisors also has the suspicion of interfering with thought. If you supervise them for not studying hard, foreigners will suspect something else, it's really inappropriate."

Mr. Hu thought for a while and said, "Thirty years ago, I wrote an article called 'A Non-Overseas Study Talk.' This article was not included in 'Wen Cun' later. The main idea was that the country should invest more in running universities, and they should be run well, to a level that can satisfy domestic students—then there would be no need for overseas study. Between 1936 and 1937, the universities in China were at their most developed, comparable to foreign universities, at least more than ten of them. Although they suffered losses during the war, as long as the country is stable, I believe that in just two or three years—at most four years, they will definitely be able to recover. Not only the undergraduate programs, but also the graduate schools, it won't be a problem."

A chubby gentleman pushed open the door and entered, wearing small glasses, with a large pipe in his mouth, wearing slippers, and his hair disheveled like a small pyramid hastily molded from plaster—it was, of course, Mr. Fu Sinian. Mr. Hu smiled and invited him in to talk, but Mr. Fu didn't even finish hearing the phrase "They are reporters" before hurrying away!

I smiled and asked Mr. Hu if it was okay to talk about "a little bit" of politics, what his views were on the constitutional amendment draft. I knew that this question would definitely lead to awkwardness, but since it was time to leave anyway, I might as well try. Of course, I hadn't forgotten that Mr. Hu was also a diplomat. Mr. Hu smiled and came over and said, "This is difficult to talk about. Didn't I say four months ago that I was going to be an elementary school student when I came back this time? Students should have textbooks, and I always thought that the National Assembly Preparatory Committee would provide us with some reference materials—but there were none at all, I simply don't know anything."

At that moment, I thought about how to write the title of this interview: "Interview with National Assembly Delegate Hu Shih" didn't seem as good as the current title, so I gladly walked out of that warm room in the Institute of History and Philology. (14th)

### Enthusiasm of Women Representatives at the National Assembly

— Our Special Correspondent

Women representatives at the National Assembly account for a fraction of the total number of 2,050. Although female compatriots make up half of the compatriots nationwide, it is true, as Secretary-General of the National Assembly Preparatory Committee, Hong Lanyou, said at a press conference, "Other countries have been constitutional for a long time, while we have only just begun, so we are naturally lagging behind." This inevitable lag is naturally manifested here. There is no need to explain how many female compatriots exerted themselves and ran around shouting to fight for female participation in the National Assembly before the list was released, and how many female compatriots were ridiculed for only knowing how to fight for rights. Now that the list has been released, from a woman's perspective, we can still feel somewhat at ease, because whether they are officially designated female representatives by the National Government, directly selected female representatives, or regional female representatives, they are all worthy of being representatives of female compatriots. Each of them earned their position with the talents they have demonstrated in the past or present.

We have a feeling that women are always more enthusiastic about things, especially when it comes to things that matter. For example, in terms of representative registration, they all rushed to complete the procedures as soon as possible, and they are particularly hopeful for the National Assembly. If you visit each female representative and ask for their opinions on national affairs and their hopes for the National Assembly, each of them will definitely tell you that they hope everyone will be open and honest, calmly resolve the issues, and allow the National Assembly to be held in an atmosphere of peace, unity, and solidarity.

Each female representative has her own career, whether in education or science, or in various departments that serve the country. This time, the representatives gathered in the capital from various places, sightseeing the capital and visiting old friends. At the same time, they also held several tea parties, introducing the living conditions of women in various regions, the regional economy, and their careers to everyone, so they were able to achieve the practical effect of exchanging opinions and learning from each other.

Among the representatives, some were originally in Nanjing, such as Chiang Soong Mei-ling, Liu Hengjing, Chen Yiyun, Zhuang Jing, Tang Guozhen, Xie Yifang, Shen Huilian, and Lu Yunzhang, who are all members of the Central Women's Movement Committee and chairpersons, directors, and supervisors of the Women's Guidance Committee. They are in constant contact with the broad masses of women and also serve the broad masses of women. They know the hardships of female compatriots, and they practically relieve the suffering of female compatriots, so they can truly represent the opinions of the female masses and are qualified to be representatives of women.

There are also female representatives from various places, such as Wu Jingbin, Deng Meizhu Na, Tao Jitian, Zhang Bangzhen, Feng Yunxian, and Luo Heng, who all have outstanding career achievements in Xinjiang, Xikang, Yunnan, and other places. They walk around the streets all day carrying a large leather bag in a hurry. If you want to know their extraordinary talents and outstanding demeanor, just pay attention to their various active postures at the upcoming National Assembly. (13th)
