### Guo-Gong (KMT-CCP) Reopen Political Negotiations; Both Sides Express Willingness to Promote the Realization of Ceasefire and Transportation Resumption

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 25th Dispatch] Striving for a comprehensive peaceful ceasefire and negotiations on restoring transportation have become concrete after several meetings between Special Envoy Marshall, Yu Da-Wei, and Zhou Enlai. On the morning of the 25th, Zhou Enlai, upon invitation, went to No. 5 Ninghai Road to continue discussions with Envoy Marshall on the government's important precondition of promptly restoring transportation on the Jinpu (Tianjin-Pukou) and Pinghan (Beijing-Hankou) Railways to save the more than ten million distressed refugees in northern and southern Henan. It is also heard that representatives from both the Kuomintang (KMT) and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) will hold sincere discussions this afternoon to resolve various important issues concerning the current ceasefire, transportation resumption, and reopening of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC). It is said that the opinions of both sides are closer than before, but the CCP is still considering the restoration of transportation on the Jinpu and Pinghan Railways. It is also rumored that the CCP delegation is urgently telegraphing Yan'an for instructions to cope with the current new situation.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 25th Dispatch] The door to KMT-CCP negotiations reopened today. At 5 PM, government representatives Shao Lizi, Wang Shijie, and Zhang Lisheng, along with CCP representatives Zhou Enlai, Dong Biwu, and Lu Dingyi, as well as PCC Secretary Lei Zhen, held a historic meeting in the reception room of a small Western-style house at No. 8 Jingzhi Road, Langya Road, in the capital. It is said that the meeting lasted nearly three hours.

[Central News Agency Nanjing 25th Dispatch] Political negotiations, which had been dormant for a long time, have now reopened. Government representatives invited CCP representatives to a meeting at Secretary-General Shao Lizi's residence at No. 8 Langya Road at 5 PM today. This is likely the first formal negotiation between government and CCP representatives on issues related to the PCC after the return to the capital. Government representatives Wang Shijie, Shao Lizi, and Zhang Lisheng, and CCP representatives Zhou Enlai, Dong Biwu, Lu Dingyi, and Secretary-General Lei Zhen all attended. It is reported that today's meeting involved an exchange of views on three issues: cessation of military conflict, restoration of transportation, and cessation of mutually provocative propaganda. Finally, both sides expressed their willingness to work hard to achieve these goals as soon as possible.

[United Press Nanjing 25th Dispatch] The political stalemate of the past month has shown a glimmer of hope for resolution tonight due to the informal exchange of views between representatives of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party.

[Associated Press Nanjing 25th Dispatch] Senior officials from both the KMT and the CCP held talks at Shao Lizi's residence today. This is the first formal negotiation of its kind between the KMT and the CCP since the National Army recovered Changchun.

[Central News Agency Local Dispatch] Wu Tiecheng, Secretary of the Central Party Headquarters, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing the night before last. Yesterday, he met with reporters and said: "This trip is for a weekend holiday to rest in Shanghai and take care of personal matters. I will return to Nanjing in two days and have not met with any parties." When reporters asked about his views on the current overall situation, Wu expressed great optimism. He said: "The government and all parties and the people equally hope to achieve peace, unity, and solidarity. Recently, the National Army recovered Changchun, which is the recovery of sovereignty. This is of course very beneficial to the overall situation, but whether it can break the stalemate in negotiations for the realization of thorough peace and unity depends entirely on the second step of the CCP's actions."

### National Army Advancing Towards Haji; General Sun Liren Sympathizes with Suffering People

[United Press Peiping 25th Dispatch] According to authoritative sources today: The National Army under General Du Yuming, after occupying Changchun, is reportedly advancing towards Harbin. The National Army encountered some resistance from the Communist forces under Lin Biao and has now crossed 25 miles beyond Changchun.

[Central News Agency Fanyang 25th Dispatch] Zhao Chen, commander of the 91st Division of the 71st Army, was wounded in the head while leading his troops in battle during the fierce fighting at Taipingcen, Lishu, on the 17th, and has been sent to Shenyang for treatment. Lishu is the location of Lin Biao's headquarters. Taipingcen has a dangerous terrain, and the fortifications built there are extremely strong, with several layers of deep trenches. The National Army only managed to recapture it after three days of fierce fighting.

[Associated Press Peiping 25th Dispatch] After Du Yuming's troops cleared the remaining Communist forces from Changchun, they continued north along the railway line towards Harbin today. Liu De, commander of the Second Security Brigade, reportedly escaped a few hours before Changchun was captured by the Communist forces on the 18th of last month. Liu and approximately 1,000 other National Army officers and soldiers were surrounded by the Communist forces at the Datong Assembly Field headquarters in Changchun. Liu personally led 100 men to repel the Communist forces before breaking out of the encirclement.

[United Press Gongzhuling Military Headquarters 24th Dispatch] (Delayed) Lieutenant General Sun Liren, commander of the New First Army, stated: "The Chinese civil war may end in Changchun because the government forces, after occupying this northeastern capital, 'will halt their advance and await instructions.'" Speaking at a meeting hosting journalists from the United States, France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and China, Sun said: "We hate civil war. We fought the Japanese for a long time, and the people suffered deeply. If these people (implicitly referring to the Communist Party) have any conscience, they will not want to destroy the country and put the people in a more miserable situation." General Sun attacked the poor discipline of the "Soviet Allied Forces" during the occupation of the Northeast. He said: "Soviet troops raped Northeast women over the age of twelve. The Soviet 'Allied Forces' dismantled and took away all the best vehicles, locomotives, and industrial equipment. Compared to the development of industry in the Northeast by the Japanese, there is a huge difference in the Soviet Union's plunder." General Sun's troops have been feeling the shortage of military supplies since the end of Lend-Lease. Now they are practicing thrift. The New Sixth Army, which participated in the India-Burma campaign and was equipped with American equipment, is in the same situation.

[United Press Changchun 24th Dispatch] By noon today, the entire urban area of Changchun was in the hands of the National Army. The people enthusiastically cheered and welcomed the American-equipped New First Army as it entered the city. The people also cheered the journalists who arrived here today from Sipingjie. Changchun itself suffered little damage from the war. Water, electricity, and telephones in the city are still available as usual. Several light locomotives and about 200 vehicles at the station were not destroyed by the Communist forces. The main force of the National Army column has advanced ten miles north of Changchun.

### Chairman Jiang Inspects Tiexi Factory District in Shenyang

[Our Newspaper Peiping 25th Dispatch] Chairman Jiang, in Shenyang, summoned Sun Yueqi and inquired in detail about the situation of taking over various large and small factories. He also personally ordered that preparations be actively made for the resumption of work in the factories and that business be restored quickly. After receiving the order, Sun is stepping up preparations for the start of work in the factories. His return to Peiping and going to Nanjing has been postponed. Also, it has been said that Marshal Marshall will fly to Shenyang, but this has not been officially confirmed.

[Central News Agency Shenyang 25th Dispatch] Chairman Jiang took a car to inspect the Tiexi factory area for a week at 4 PM on the 25th, and then went to the Eastern Headquarters and the Northeast Security Commander's Headquarters for inspection.

### Two Soviets Killed in Changchun; National Army Takes Emergency Measures

[United Press Changchun 24th Dispatch] Two Soviet citizens were killed here today by Chinese rioters during a mass riot. This act reflects their resentment towards the actions of the Soviets before the National Army recovered Changchun. The National Army immediately took emergency measures, moving the 160 Soviet citizens residing in Changchun into the Yamato Hotel, where five American journalists were detained half a month ago, and warned them that the National Army could not be responsible for their safety if they ventured out of the hotel. The killings occurred while the National Army was still conducting mopping-up operations in the city.

### Lu Dingyi's Statement

[Central News Agency Nanjing 25th Dispatch] Lu Dingyi of the CCP delegation issued a statement saying: "The withdrawal of the Democratic Allied Army from Changchun was carried out in accordance with orders prepared by Yan'an." Observers here believe that Lu's statement was issued to save face for the "Democratic Allied Army." Moreover, this statement is too late. Observers further pointed out that if the purpose of Lu's statement is to explain that the CCP will automatically withdraw from various areas in the Northeast that the government has already taken over but were occupied by the Communist forces, such as Harbin, Qiqihar, etc., and will not hinder the government's actions to recover sovereignty, then it depends on whether Yan'an will also order a withdrawal from these areas, which can be tested by facts.

### Yang Chuo'an, Peng Jiqun, and Others Leave Vladivostok for Shanghai Yesterday; Personnel for Northeast Takeover Stationed in Peiping Depart for Shenyang

[Our Newspaper Peiping 25th Dispatch] According to a source: Yang Chuo'an, Mayor of Harbin, Peng Jiqun, Chairman of Nenjiang, and more than 40 takeover personnel withdrawn from Changchun, are scheduled to take a ship from Vladivostok to Shanghai today.

### Legislative Yuan Meeting Passes Bills to Abolish Wartime Military Laws, etc.; Urges Premier Song to Report on Financial and Economic Policies

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 25th Dispatch] The 300th meeting of the Fourth Legislative Yuan was held in Nanjing at 9 AM this morning. Sixty-six legislators including Sun Jiulu, Hong Rui, Lou Tongsun, Jian Guansan, Chen Xun, Chen Chang, Chen Haizheng, Tan Wu, etc. attended. Chairman Sun Ke first had the Secretary-General of the meeting report on the minutes of the previous meeting and the five items including the instructions of the National Government that the China-Ecuador Friendship Treaty should be approved, and that the Executive Yuan has been ordered to instruct the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to handle it as usual. Then, the discussion began, and the following motions were passed: (1) Draft amendment to the Organization Law of the Ministry of Communications, (2) Draft regulations on the organization of the National Border Culture and Education Center (Huang Youchang, Lou Tongsun, Zhao Naichuan, and others had some extensions on the word "Borderland"), (3) Reply approving the abolishment of the Military Law of the Republic of China during wartime, (4) Reply approving the extension of the Regulations on Handling Cases Involving US Military Personnel in China for one year, (5) Reply approving the abolishment of the Regulations on the Management of Nitrate and Sulfur, (6) Review of the 12th supplementary budget of the ordinary national expenditure of Xikang Province for the 34th year of the Republic of China, (7) Review of the operating budget of the Steel Allocation Plant under the Ministry of Communications for the 35th year of the Republic of China. B. Items retained: (1) Draft Regulations on the Organization of the Capital Police Department. The reason for the retention is that committee members such as Tan Tianxin raised that the current police district system implemented in various places is related to this case, and it was then decided to discuss it together with the case of the Police General Administration, and submitted it for review, and discuss at the next meeting, (2) Draft Regulations on Unified Commodity Tax, (3) Draft Regulations on Domestic Tobacco and Alcohol Tax. The reason for retaining the above two cases is that the items of goods subject to the commodity tax have not been perfected, and should be submitted for review again, and the items should be increased before revision. C. Temporary motion: (1) The Legislative Yuan resolved at the last meeting to request Premier Song of the Executive Yuan to attend the regular meeting to report on financial and economic policies. Premier Song replied that the financial and economic situation after the war is complicated, and asked for the items to be opened to provide written answers. However, the committee members believed that the Legislative Yuan is the highest legislative body of the government, and all national measures should have explicit regulations before all laws and regulations can be approved. Therefore, it was decided to write to Premier Song again, urging him to attend the next regular meeting and report and consult on financial and economic policies. (2) The President designated several people to specifically investigate the current financial, monetary, and economic situation. Before Sun's mention of the title of President: The multiple of the salary increase for civil servants decided by the last regular meeting of this committee was 600 times the original salary, plus a living allowance of 150,000 yuan. However, the Central Social News issued a news release on the same day saying that the increase was 1,000 times, plus a living allowance of 200,000 (this newspaper's special dispatch is correct). It is actually a misrepresentation and will be corrected. Then Li Qing, Jian Guansan, Dai Xiujun, and other committee members made speeches to explain the misunderstandings of the general public, and the meeting was quite intense, and it did not end until 1:00 PM.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 25th Dispatch] Regarding the increase in salaries for civil servants, legislators Sun Jiulu, Lou Tongsun, etc. said: The current salaries of civil servants are indeed too low. The Legislative Yuan approved 600 times the base salary plus a living allowance of 150,000 yuan, which is not too high. The employees of China Textile Corporation are paid 2,000 times their base salary of 80 yuan, and those with a base salary of more than 80 yuan are paid 1,000 times. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company pays all employees 2,000 times their base salary. Therefore, one employee can earn more than 100,000 yuan. As for the claim that this new regulation will increase the national budget by 690 million yuan and stimulate price increases, it is unbelievable. Because civil servants' salaries have only increased by 160 times to date, while prices have increased by 3,000 or 5,000 times.

### Jinan People's Volunteer Training Team Formally Established

### Rehe Provincial Three-Person Executive Group to Depart Immediately to Mediate Conflicts; 30,000 Communist Troops Attack Yebaishou

[Our Newspaper Peiping 25th Dispatch] Zhu Jiewu, the representative sent by the military government to Beipiao in Rehe Province, has returned to Peiping today. According to reports, as a result of his liaison, the three-person executive groups in Chengde, Chifeng, and Chaoyang in Rehe Province will depart immediately to begin mediating the conflicts in Rehe.

[Central News Agency Chaoyang 24th Dispatch] On April 13, tens of thousands of Communist troops in Rehe launched an offensive, launching successive attacks on Beipiao, Gushan, Reshui, Pingzhuang, and other places, and carried out large-scale destruction, causing the general public to be displaced and nine out of ten houses empty. Recently, the situation has worsened, and more than 30,000 Communist troops have been assembled to besiege Yebaishou. According to reliable reports, there are the 22nd, 27th, and 30th Brigades and the 1st and 3rd Brigades, among which there are Japanese people, and there are many cavalry.

### Wang Yaowu Sends Personnel to Linyi to Invite Sun Yi to Discuss Shandong Situation; Shandong War Enters Stalemate

[Our Newspaper Jinan 25th Dispatch] Military sources: The Communist forces have gathered more than 20,000 troops near Yucheng, with the intention of attacking Qihe and Jinan. Also, more than 3,000 Communist troops have increased from Longshan to Guodian, with 40 vehicles attached, and are now advancing towards Shili, claiming that they will attack Jinan.

[Our Newspaper Jinan 24th Dispatch] Wang Yaowu, commander of the Second Pacification Zone, specially dispatched Deputy Chief of Staff Luo Xingli to accompany Davis, the American representative of the Jinan Group, and Wen Ze, the government representative, to fly to Linyi by special plane on the morning of the 24th to invite Chen Yi, commander of the Communist New Fourth Army, to Jinan or to Peiping. According to semi-official sources, this negotiation is about the future of peace and war in Shandong.

[Our Newspaper Jinan 24th Dispatch] The offensive of the Communist forces against the Jiaoji Railway line and the Jinan Outer Corps has been quelled due to the emergency measures taken by the National Army, which effectively blocked them. As of yesterday, the battles in various places have mostly entered a stalemate. Only Guodian has had minor conflicts, and the tense atmosphere in Shandong in the past week has obviously eased. However, the Communist forces besieging Tai'an, Yizhou, Liaocheng, and Dexian have continued to increase their strength, and the Communist forces' mobilization near Qingdao is still very frequent. Around Zhucun and Zhangdian, more than 40,000 Communist troops have gathered, with a rather opportunistic appearance.

### Recent Traffic Situation on Jiaoji and Jinpu Railways

[Our Newspaper Jinan 24th Dispatch] Since the Communist forces occupied Mingshui, Longshan, and other stations on the Jiaoji Railway, eastbound trains have been suspended.

The Jinan-Tai'an section and the Jinan-Yancheng section of the Jinpu Railway are still maintained as they were.

[Our Newspaper Jinan 24th Dispatch] According to military and political authorities here, the Executive Group will continue to negotiate with the Communist forces regarding the Shanshui and Sishui areas occupied by the Communist forces on the Jiaoji Railway, hoping that the Communist forces will follow peaceful methods and withdraw voluntarily.

[Our Newspaper Jinan 23rd Dispatch] There was a small contact in Guodian on the 23rd, but the Communist forces increased their troops in Liaocheng, Dezhou, and Tai'an, and intensified their blockade. The situation is dangerous and serious. The Lu military and political authorities stated that they are determined to use reasonable methods to make them retreat voluntarily.

The Second Rong Division, originally waiting in Haiphong to go to Japan, will continue to be transported north according to the original plan.

### Trial of Traitor Lin Bosheng Concluded in Nanjing, Sentencing Scheduled for the Morning of the 31st of this Month

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] The pseudo-Minister of Propaganda, Lin Bosheng, was publicly tried at the First Tribunal of the Capital High Court at 10 AM today. The arrangement of the courtroom and the support of the audience were the same as during the trial of Mei Siping. The Central Broadcasting Station's on-site photography team also arrived to broadcast and film newsreels. Presiding Judge was Zhao Chen, with Judges Ge Zhishang, and Jin Liewen. Prosecutor was Li Shihang, with clerks Xu Yizhen and Hua Shisheng. The traitor Lin was wearing a light gray paletot robe and yellow leather shoes, with silver-rimmed toric glasses on his nose. He entered the courtroom swaying and looking around under the watchful eyes of the crowd, appearing calm. Lin, a native of Guangdong, is 45 years old. Before the war, he served as a legislator, director of the Institute of International Studies, special commissioner of the Central Propaganda Department stationed in Hong Kong, and president of the Hong Kong Nanhua Daily, among other positions. Prosecutor Li read the indictment. The Presiding Judge then asked why he did not go to Chongqing. Lin replied that he only went to Hankou, and was then assigned to Hong Kong as the Director of the Institute of International Studies. Asked when he became involved with Wang Jingwei, he replied that he originally worked with Mr. Liao Zhongkai, and after Mr. Liao's death, he followed Wang Jingwei. Regarding the telegraph incident, Lin vehemently denied any involvement, claiming that he did not know the content of the telegraph beforehand. It was given to him by Chen Gongbo on the 28th, and he only learned about it when it was published in the Nanhua Daily and sent to the Central News Agency. He claimed that he had published it under orders, just like the traitor Mei Siping, indicating that the theories of traitors are generally similar. Lin also claimed that Wang Jingwei was the Vice President of the party at the time and had given him a letter saying that "peace negotiations" were merely suggestions. It was full peace or full war, peace by the central government, war also by the central government. Therefore, he believed that he had not deviated from the party's stance. As for the secret negotiations with the enemy, Lin vaguely skirted the issue and kept it a secret. However, he confessed to attending the pseudo Sixth National Congress and the pseudo Political Conference with Wang Jingwei to meet with Emperor Showa and others. Regarding the theft of the national orthodoxy, Lin cunningly argued, "Because the country cannot be divided, and the national system cannot be changed." The Presiding Judge sternly asked, "Is there a real National Government in Chongqing, do you know that or not?" Lin reluctantly replied, "I know, but ours is in the occupied area." This was immediately exposed by the Presiding Judge, "Then it is clearly a fake." This caused a burst of laughter in the courtroom, and Lin also shrugged and frowned, revealing his ugly state.

### Condemning the Central Government in Writing, Lin Pleads Guilty in Court

The Presiding Judge also presented the secret peace plan, basic treaty, and Sino-Japanese alliance, etc. that the pseudo-government had boldly signed with Japan, treaties that would destroy the country and exterminate the people, to interrogate Lin. Lin strongly argued, "Diplomacy has advances and retreats. This is a technique. In the circumstances at that time, we had no choice but to compromise." When the Presiding Judge asked about the article he wrote, "Thinking of September 3rd from September 9th," Lin suddenly felt guilty and remorseful, and said in repentance, "That article was defamatory of the central government and Chairman Chiang. I admit my mistake." The Presiding Judge also mentioned that when Lin was the "pseudo-Governor of Anhui Province," he publicly sold opium and collected fees from opium dens, etc. Lin flatly denied this, saying, "If Bosheng ever took money from opium, please have the government execute me for this. If the government does not execute me, the people can also execute me." The continuous use of "execute" might be his way of expressing his repentance. After asking about his property and family, the court announced the beginning of the debate. Lin used his glib tongue to deliver a torrent of sophistry, repeating his set of theories to fool the people, and even gave a vivid speech, as if he had forgotten that he was in the defendant's dock. No matter how skilled his speech was, the distorted content could not gain him any sympathy. He vigorously emphasized the pseudo-Youth League's anti-drug campaign, believing it to be an "achievement" that could not be ignored. His defense lasted for one hour and ten minutes. After Lin finished speaking, the court-appointed defender Liu Xiancai stood up to defend three points: (1) The defendant had worked with Mr. Liao Zhongkai before the war and had contributed to the country. (2) During his tenure as the pseudo-Minister of Propaganda, he still had a national concept and promoted the anti-drug campaign. (3) He was able to admit his mistakes and was frank and sincere. The debate ended at 2:25 PM. The court will announce the verdict at 10:00 AM on the 31st of this month. Lin was remanded in custody. Lin's cousin Zhang Xushu and nephew Lin Jia also attended the hearing. According to them, Lin's family has a large population and is currently living in poverty in Shanghai, relying entirely on friends to survive.

### Review of Chen Bijun's Sentence, Ruling Sent to Nanjing

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 25th] Chen Bijun's application for review after being sentenced to life imprisonment by the Suzhou High Court was rejected by the Supreme Court, and the original verdict was approved. The original text of the ruling was delivered here today. The reporter read the contents and stated that Chen's defense of preserving cultural relics, helping refugees, and stabilizing grain prices, etc., was considered irrelevant to the establishment of the crime, even if true. As for presiding over the South China Special Affairs, because the grounds were not clearly stated, it was not considered. Moreover, considering that the defendant and the traitor Wang were husband and wife, and she agreed with her husband's claims and stepped into the legal net unknowingly, her criminal intent of conspiracy was slightly different, so sparing her death was not inappropriate and the original verdict should be approved.

### Enemy Spy Zhang Xiaolong Arrested in Nanjing

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] The traitor Zhang Xiaolong, who served as the chief spy of the enemy's gendarmerie in Shanghai and the enemy's translation organ, committed many evils and was well-known. Recently, he was active in the logistics department after the capital's return and served as a receiving officer in Zhenjiang. After verification by a certain institution, he was captured in Nanjing at 6:00 PM tonight. At that time, he resisted arrest, but was disarmed and taken into custody. He is currently being interrogated.

### Wang Yaowu Orders His Subordinates to Donate Grain to Aid Staff and Students

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 25th] General Wang Yaowu, Commander of the Third Pacification Zone, has always been extremely concerned about the suffering of the people in Shandong. Recently, upon hearing that students in Jinan's schools have been affected by the Communist Party's struggle, and their families are on the verge of bankruptcy and their sources of support have been cut off, he issued a hand-written order to the three armies under his command to donate 479,885 catties of grain saved from reduced rations to provide relief to staff and students of various schools.

### Truman to Visit the Philippines in Early July, Inviting Chairman Chiang to Meet, Invitations to Independence Ceremony Sent

[Central News Agency, Washington, 24th] This reporter has learned from well-informed sources that President Truman is eager to meet with Chairman Chiang in Manila on July 4th, when the Philippines declares its independence. President Truman plans to first fly to Guam, and then take a warship from Guam to Manila. The President's trip depends on the resolution of some major domestic issues in the United States. It is reported that formal invitations have been issued, inviting Chairman Chiang to attend the Philippine Independence Ceremony on July 4th, but currently there are no concrete plans that can be announced officially.

### Failure of US and Soviet Union to Reach Understanding Causes Instability in Far East Politics, Welles Says US Should Strive to Catch Up

[Associated Press, Washington, 24th] Former US Undersecretary of State Welles declared today that there is little hope for establishing a "peaceful rule" in China, India, and other politically unstable areas in Asia. The great powers have failed to reach an agreement on post-war solutions, and they should be directly responsible for most of the events in the Far East today. The incessant civil strife in China will continue until the US and the Soviet Union can reach some kind of understanding. This will encourage the political unity of the Chinese people, rather than hinder it. The entire Far East is suffering from the scourge of civil war due to the conflict of interests between the Soviet Union and the Western powers, with unrest everywhere. It has been almost a year since the end of the war in the Far East after Japan's defeat. However, in Vietnam, France is only temporarily suppressing the resistance of the local people by force. Korea is currently divided into two tightly sealed areas, one controlled by the Soviet Union and the other managed by the United States. The failure of the US and the Soviet Union to reach an agreement has prevented the Korean people from making any progress toward the independence promised at the Cairo Conference in 1943, and they cannot begin the reconstruction of their country. Of particular concern is the situation in India, which is at a critical juncture. It seems almost impossible to reach an agreement to allow the Indian people to regain their independence in the near future. Unless Indian political leaders can reach some agreement soon to establish a provisional government in preparation for eventual independence, the most serious unrest may occur at any time. Therefore, I believe that the US government should strive to catch up and urge the United Nations to take on joint responsibility and ensure that the Eastern nations striving for freedom can obtain assistance as soon as possible to move toward complete independence. This is probably the only way to prevent widespread disaster and ensure that the dependent nations of the East are protected in their pursuit of freedom.

### Chongqing Labor Issues, Proposed Solution

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 24th] The Chongqing Social Affairs Bureau's proposed solution to the Chongqing labor problem has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for review and will be implemented step by step after approval.

Now we are starting to repair the mud pond. When the tide comes, it will weaken the impact on the stone seawall, and the mud pond can effectively resist it. The Hangzhou-Haining, Shaoxing, and Pinghu three-section project is scheduled to be completed before July 15th.

### Rice Prices in Nanjing Expected to Fall, Mayor Ma Tells Reporters

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] Nanjing Mayor Ma, when hosting reporters this afternoon, spoke about the rice situation in Nanjing: The city's rice prices have already fallen. If we can ensure that rice is not detained along the way and use passenger ships to transport rice exclusively, the source will naturally be smooth. Furthermore, if the rice prices in the areas near the city, such as Wuhu and Dangtu, are similar to those in the city, the rice source will not be obstructed. Also, the imported rice that our country purchased from the West is expected to arrive in Shanghai soon, so rice prices in Nanjing are expected to fall.

Zhenjiang

County Assembly Standing Committee Resolution

The Standing Committee of the County Provisional Assembly held its third meeting on the 23rd and resolved: 1. This county is not a rice-producing area, and recent food reserves have been depleted. The supply from other areas is scarce, leading to soaring rice prices and public panic. With a surge of refugees from northern Jiangsu, we earnestly request Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to allocate a quantity for emergency relief and order a halt to military grain purchases to relieve the county. 2. The County Water and Electricity Consolidation Committee is not well-organized and its measures are inappropriate.

Request for Relief from Stagnant Sales of Boiled Salt

Since the victory, the authorities of the Bao Lang and Haisha Salt Fields in Zhejiang, in order to improve the livelihood of salt workers and eliminate the contractor system, allowed merchants and citizens to freely compete in sales and entrusted the Minsheng Salt Industry to advance warehouse prices. They ordered sundried salt from the Yuyao Salt Field for direct distribution to salt merchants and soy sauce shops in the Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou area. Consequently, the cost of boiled salt from the Bao and Hai fields was higher, affecting sales and the livelihoods of the salt workers. In addition to completely halting production, they have jointly applied to the authorities for relief.

Weekly Forum

### A Humble Proposal to Revise Import Tariffs

— Xu Jizhuang

(1) The Impact of the Current Exchange Rate on Trade

The foreign exchange rate recently set by the central government is relatively high. Taking the US dollar as an example, each US dollar is worth 2,020 Chinese yuan. Compared to the pre-war rate of three yuan per US dollar, this is only an increase of about 670 times. However, the value of the Chinese yuan domestically has recently fallen to less than one two-thousandth. Therefore, the prices of goods at home and abroad are deviating from the norm, and the value of the Chinese yuan has increased too much internationally. Under such an exchange rate, import values will inevitably far exceed exports, resulting in a huge import surplus. In international trade, the following phenomena will occur:

(A) Due to the higher exchange rate of the Chinese yuan, not only is the market wide open, but it is also artificially favorable to imports. Countries are vying to promote exports in order to compete for the post-war market and will inevitably sell large quantities of goods to our country. Chinese merchants, due to profit motives, will also abandon domestic goods and order foreign goods. As a result, the increase in the trade deficit will put pressure on the exchange market, making it difficult to maintain the exchange rate.

(B) Due to the high price of raw materials, high wages for workers, coupled with transportation difficulties and inferior production technology, the value of Chinese-made products, converted at an exchange rate of 2,000 to 1, is higher than that of foreign goods, making it difficult to sell them abroad. The export industry will be unable to operate. Chinese export goods are now among the most expensive in the world market, and the future is very bleak!

(C) China's industry was not developed before the war and has been devastated by the war, bordering on bankruptcy. After the war, raw materials are expensive, and production technology will be difficult to improve for a while. At an exchange rate of 2,000 to 1, manufactured goods cannot compete with foreign goods. This inherently weak industry will also have no day of recovery under artificial exchange rates.

(D) Although cheaper imports may temporarily alleviate the pressure of prices on the people, for those who have endured hardship for a long time, this is not necessarily beneficial. However, if this continues, more and more imported goods will drive domestic goods out of the market. Not only will imports and exports be unbalanced, and industry bankrupt, but the country will inevitably become poorer and poorer, and its purchasing power will weaken. Eventually, imports will also shrink, and only a few wealthy classes will still be able to consume some imported luxury goods. With the decline of national industry and the decay of machinery and equipment, what will become of the very essence when the skin is gone? The entire economy will inevitably be unable to recover.

In view of the above-mentioned disadvantages that may occur in international trade, some people advocate changing the exchange rate as a remedy. Their reasoning is that a lower exchange rate has the effect of promoting export trade. After the development of export trade, the agriculture and industry producing export goods will also recover, and people's employment and income can be increased accordingly. Especially in the interior, after the population and economic strength move to the coast, there may be a phenomenon of falling prices and economic recession. Promoting export trade to enable inland production to shift to the production of export goods is the most effective and natural remedy. Such arguments have their reasons, but after the exchange rate is lowered, although it can promote exports, it is extremely unfavorable to imports. At a time when China urgently needs foreign materials for economic construction, if the necessary import costs increase due to the exchange rate, it will greatly hinder the construction work. More importantly, a lower exchange rate is sufficient to stimulate domestic prices, causing them to rise. The rise in prices is already very obvious, and further stimulation by devaluing the exchange rate will inevitably increase price fluctuations.

The author believes that in order to use foreign materials for construction and at the same time prevent imports from hindering the development of domestic industry, it is better to use tariff policy as a manipulating tool than relying on the exchange rate. Tariff policy is more effective and flexible.

(2) The Import Tariff Needs to Be Revised Immediately. Using tariff policy can make international trade more balanced and the national economy slightly more stable. The import tariff needs to be revised immediately.

China's current import tariff was promulgated in the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934). At that time, unequal treaties had not yet been abolished, and tariff policy was not fully autonomous. The last revision of the tariff, although seemingly automatic, was in fact constrained by Japan. Moreover, since the late Qing Dynasty, it has survived in a semi-colonial state for a long time. At that time, European and American countries used their dual political and economic power to protect the dumping of their large quantities of goods in the Chinese market and used trade treaties to prevent China from establishing a good tariff system. Although tariff autonomy was later obtained, it was still difficult to change the deeply rooted problems. The domestic production base was not established, and tariff revenue was the largest source of revenue for the government at the time. Therefore, the import tariffs that China has formulated in the past often focused on the amount of tax revenue and could not fully meet the requirements of the national economy. During the War of Resistance, the coast fell, and import and export trade plummeted. When the Yunnan-Burma Road was cut off, there was no way to communicate at home and abroad, and tariffs became a secondary problem. A group of economists began to concentrate their efforts on discussing how to open up financial resources to cope with the military and political expenses of the extraordinary period, and had no time to study import tariffs. Now that victory has come, nine months have passed. The Supreme National Defense Council at that time passed a resolution to open the foreign exchange market, with foreign exchange and trade being equally important. The Central Bank's Interim Measures for the Management of Foreign Exchange and the Interim Measures for Import and Export Trade were promulgated simultaneously, and lists of goods that were "freely imported," "licensed for import," and "prohibited for import" were also compiled separately. The spirit of promulgating this trade method was influenced by the global wave of reducing trade barriers, especially the American advocacy of free trade. Except for a few imports that require a permit or are prohibited, all are freely imported. Although this principle is not easy to change, the level of tax rates for freely imported goods still has considerable room for flexibility. If the tax rates are revised, the stimulus of foreign exchange advantages for imported goods can be offset or reduced by the tax rates, thereby remedying the disadvantages of excessively high exchange rates.

Moreover, the rise and fall of the exchange rate affects the entire international trade, and its impact on imports and exports, and on various types of imported and exported goods, is generally consistent and cannot be differentiated. Tariff policy does not have this difficulty. Different tax rates can be set for various imported and exported goods. For imported goods that are necessary and should be encouraged, extremely low taxes or even tax exemptions can be levied to allow them to enjoy the advantages of the exchange rate and be imported. Imported goods that are not needed or do not need to be encouraged can be subject to higher import taxes so that although the import price is very low due to the exchange rate advantages, it will not be too far from domestic products after adding tariffs. Such differential treatment can only be remedied by revising import tax rates.

(3) Principles for Revising Import Tax Rates

China's industry is backward. In order to promote production and development, the import tariffs promulgated in the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934) should be abolished under the principle of not hindering international cooperation, and new import tax rates should be formulated based on the following principles:

A. Machinery and equipment related to industrialization should have low tax rates or be exempt from tax.

B. Raw materials that cannot be produced domestically should be taxed at a low rate.

C. Daily necessities for the people's livelihood, which cannot be manufactured for the time being before domestic industry has recovered, should have their import taxes reduced. However, these tax rates should be flexible and should be increased or decreased at any time according to the development of domestic industry.

D. The tax rate on luxury goods should be increased as much as possible, so that except for a few wealthy classes, the general public has no ability to purchase them.

E. The import tax rate for goods that compete with national products must be specially increased so that national products have the possibility of competing in the domestic market.

F. Subsidize exports or add other incentives.

In this way, the value of imported goods should be reduced in the future, the value of exported goods can be increased, the balance of international trade should be closer to equilibrium, the demand in the exchange market will not always have a one-sided trend, and the stability of the exchange rate must be better maintained. Although domestic import prices will increase due to tariffs, the exchange rate does not move, so people's hearts are stable, and there is no need to worry about stimulating general prices and leading to ignorant speculation. Domestic production can compete with imported goods under reasonable conditions without being sacrificed by artificial exchange rates, and the equipment for reconstruction can still be imported at extremely favorable exchange rates. Therefore, revising import tax rates can take care of all aspects, and the future of economic construction relies on it.

### Unprecedented Severity of the US Railway Labor Strike, Truman Orders Return to Work by Deadline, Otherwise Will Have Army Take Over Trains, Says Strikers Are Challenging the Government and Should Be Responded To

[United Press International, Washington, 25th] President Truman addressed the striking railway workers nationwide today from the White House, demanding they return to work by 9 PM Standard Time today, otherwise he will order the army to take over the trains. The President likened this strike to the Japanese sneak attack on Pearl Harbor, stating: the strike has made the government face an unprecedented challenge, we must stand up and fight it, otherwise it would be an admission of incompetence. Railway union leaders Johnston and Whitney said they do not believe that strikes put private interests above the happiness of the country. If an adequate number of people do not return to work when the deadline expires, he will order soldiers to drive the trains and send troops to protect the returning workers. After the President's broadcast, telegrams of support poured in. However, railway union leaders refused to comment, and the response of the striking workers is still uncertain. The President told the strikers: I have advised Johnston and Whitney to search their conscience and consider the deaths and starvation caused by the strike. Congressional leaders said: The House will continue to meet after the President's speech in order to pass any bill that the President may propose. The Senate also agreed to temporarily suspend debate on the labor bill after the President's broadcast. However, Majority Leader Barkley said he does not believe the President will submit "definite specific" recommendations to a joint session of the House and Senate on Saturday night.

(Another dispatch) President Truman broadcast to the striking railway workers nationwide today, saying: I doubt whether the members of the two railway unions have thought about the unfortunate consequences caused by the strike when they went on strike. The transportation of relief food has now been interrupted. One hundred thousand tons of grain cannot be shipped due to the strike. People in various countries can barely make ends meet, and their daily needs depend on American relief. A small number of people in the United States are on strike, which prevents this relief food from being shipped out. How can they know that the lives of tens of thousands of people depend on this? This situation is tragic. If the American railways do not resume operation immediately, tens of thousands of people at home and abroad will starve to death.

### Special Meeting Held at the White House, General Eisenhower Also Recalled to Participate, Trains to Be Driven by Soldiers

[US Information Service, Washington, 24th] President Truman held a special meeting this afternoon, attended by the Secretary of State, Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary of the Army, Secretary of the Navy, Secretary of the Interior, Secretary of Labor, Attorney General, Director of Mobilization, and Director of the Defense Transportation Administration, as well as Dr. Stillman, the President's railway strike mediator. Army Chief of Staff General Eisenhower has shortened his trip. He declared: He has received orders to immediately go to Washington to attend the meeting. An Army Department spokesman said: The Army is on standby, ready to protect the railways if necessary, but there is no news of rioting amid the strike. The Post Office announced that only parcels weighing sixteen ounces or less can be sent to other cities, with the exclusion of airmail. UNRRA Director LaGuardia said here today that the railway strike has completely disrupted the food relief transportation plan.

The President's mediator negotiated with railway labor and management for eight hours yesterday, and negotiations only broke down at 9 PM last night, and the railway strike officially began. Union leaders formally expressed their opposition to the President's proposal, demanding a uniform hourly wage increase of 18.5%, which is their condition for withdrawing the workers' demands to revise new regulations and improve working conditions.

[United Press International, Washington, 24th] After the US railway workers went on strike, some factories have been affected and closed. According to government officials familiar with the strike situation, the government will consider dispatching soldiers with driving experience to drive trains after taking over the railways, with personnel from the Army Railway Corps as the backbone. Veterans who served in the Army Railway Corps and have now retired are also being considered for recall. The Marine Corps has also been ordered to stand by. In this way, there will be enough people to ensure that the major railways in the country do not come to a standstill, but it will take some time to summon these veterans, and it may not be until next week that the railways can maintain the minimum required train service.

[United Press International, Oakland, California, 25th] After the US railway workers went on strike, 24 four-engine US Navy transport planes are now returning from bases in the Pacific and Asia, for urgent dispatch. According to the US National Air Transport Office, air transport between Honolulu, Guam, Tokyo, Manila, and Shanghai will be reduced by 40% as a result.

[United Press International, Washington, 24th] Government mediator Stillman declared after negotiating with railway workers for several hours today: "The strike situation is grim." Today, the number of strikers nationwide has reached 960,000, and tens of thousands more are idled at any time due to the railway strike.

### Relief Materials Frozen

[Reuters, Washington, 25th] UNRRA and US Department of Agriculture officials said: the railway workers strike makes the United States unable to export the food needed by foreign countries for several weeks, if the strike continues to be prolonged in the famished areas of Europe and Asia, a great calamity will occur this summer. According to the spokesman for the UNRRA headquarters, most of the relief materials at ports on the east and west coasts have been frozen, and it is reported that dockworkers will go on strike at the beginning of next month. UNRRA officials are now consulting with labor leaders, requesting permission for UNRRA ships to continue loading.

### Two Thousand Dockworkers in Singapore Went on Strike Yesterday

Ship Activity Halted

[United Press International, Singapore, 25th] Two thousand dockworkers in this port went on strike today because a Chinese worker had his leg injured for unknown reasons. The dockworkers went on strike to express their support. Port ship activity has been halted. Port authorities have declined to comment on the efforts to stop the strike.

### Original of the Treaty of Versailles Lost

[Central News Agency, Paris, 24th] The original of the Treaty of Versailles of 1919, with the signatures of the conference representatives, after the First World War, has been lost or destroyed by the Germans. This was announced by the French Foreign Ministry when the ministry's diplomatic archives committee was established. With the exception of one copy retained at the French Embassy in Washington, all copies of the 1919 treaty have been destroyed or lost. When German troops approached Paris in June 1940, French officials burned some relevant political and diplomatic documents from that period. The Germans obtained the remaining part and transferred it to Berlin, and later moved it to Riesia. By July 3, 1940, it was moved to Elbertode and was found by the American army in the same year and returned to France.

### The British Cabinet Delegation to India Issues a Second Declaration: British Troops to Remain Stationed in India During the Transition; The Congress Party Reaffirms its Position on British Proposals

[Report from this newspaper] London, 25th Broadcast: Two hours ago (11 PM Shanghai time), the British Cabinet Delegation to India issued a second declaration in response to talks with the leaders of the Muslim League and the Standing Committee of the Congress Party. The main points can be summarized as follows: (1) During the transition period (it is hoped that the transition period will be extremely short), the British side will still be responsible for India's security; therefore, British troops will not withdraw from India for the time being. (2) After the establishment of the interim government, all administrative leadership positions will be filled by Indians, and Britain will never infringe upon Indian sovereignty.

On the other hand, the declaration stated that the British side requested the Indian side to fulfill two points: (1) The Indian side should conclude an agreement with Britain. (2) The Indian side should protect ethnic minorities.

[Reuters, New Delhi, 25th] The Indian Congress Party yesterday issued a resolution of 2,000 words, indicating that although the party wants to amend the Indian regime through peaceful cooperation, it still cannot have a final opinion on the suggestions of the British Cabinet representatives. The main points of the full text of the Congress Party Executive Committee's resolution are that the interim government and the final constitution must fully recognize the principle of Indian independence. All factors hindering independence must be removed immediately.

### British Foreign Secretary Bevin Defends Policy Towards Egypt in the House of Commons: Stationing Troops in Other Countries is Considered Outdated; Mutual Defense of the Suez Canal is Under Negotiation

[Reuters, London, 25th] Foreign Secretary Bevin defended the government's Egyptian policy in the House of Commons yesterday, saying that the Egyptian issue is extremely difficult, and the government made this policy decision after careful consideration. After the war, all countries, large and small, recognized that they had acquired new status, and the United Nations General Assembly and small meetings also confirmed this change. The era of regional defense has begun after the war, unlike the previous defense that was the sole responsibility of one country. They believe that national security is closely related to the regional defense system. Since I have been Foreign Secretary, all the countries I have contacted hold this belief. Regarding the withdrawal issue, I feel that stationing troops in other countries is an unpleasant thing in any case, and it feels particularly outdated today. Therefore, at the beginning of the treaty revision negotiations, I suggested fulfilling our promise when we first entered Egypt, that is, to withdraw troops. We should first determine this principle, and then discuss how to replace the defense deployment. I feel that this promise is a sign of goodwill, and it is better for us to propose it today than to be forced to accept it in the future. Any country occupied by a foreign country inevitably has a sense of inferiority, and one of our primary tasks is to eliminate this sense of inferiority in the Egyptians. Unfortunately, our past relationship with Egypt was only aimed at a few people, without regard to the feelings of the general Egyptian people, and the basis for true understanding lies in understanding with the general people. We must admit that the trend has changed, and it is not what it used to be. Maintaining contact with Arab countries can only be based on friendship and can no longer rely on force. Islam is scattered throughout the Middle East and reaches the Indian peninsula. I dare to assert that since we have changed to a policy of trusting the Muslim nation, our reputation in the Muslim countries has indeed increased compared to the past. Regarding the defense of the canal zone, I dare to assure the House of Commons that after the withdrawal of troops, we will make proper defense arrangements and will not just ignore it. I have represented the British government in proposing new constructions to achieve the purpose of mutual defense, which is intended not only to protect the interests of Great Britain and its Republic, but ultimately to hope to contribute to the world security plan of the United Nations organization.

Chaotic Scene

[Reuters, London, 25th] During the debate on the Egyptian issue in the House of Commons yesterday, the two major political leaders in Britain, Foreign Secretary Bevin and opposition leader Churchill, had a fierce argument, and the order was disrupted for more than ten minutes. Bevin and Churchill stood at one end of the long table. Behind the two were their supporters, and the latter cheered and cursed, causing a commotion throughout the venue. Churchill wanted to interrupt Bevin's speech, but Bevin did not allow it. The speaker shouted "Order," but it was to no avail. Later, Foreign Secretary McNeil lightly tugged on Bevin's collar, and Bevin finally allowed Churchill to speak. Suddenly, a faction supporting the government shouted that Churchill should not act like a primary school student, and the order became chaotic again. After a long time, Bevin was able to continue speaking.

Prospects for Negotiation

[Reuters, Cairo, 25th] After British Foreign Secretary Bevin announced in the House of Commons yesterday that the Egyptian negotiations would not be interrupted or stalled, those who had been pessimistic about the prospects for treaty revision negotiations were filled with hope again. The Egyptian Nationalist Party is now seizing Eden's proposal that all parties should participate in the negotiations on Egyptian independence. A representative of the Egyptian delegation said that the negotiations are expected to achieve satisfactory results, and what is now being disputed is that Britain wants to obtain all practical conveniences.

### The Northwest University Disturbance Subsides; President Liu Jihong Submits Resignation; Ministry of Education Repeatedly and Sincerely Urges Retention

[Special Dispatch from Chenggu by this Newspaper] Liu Jihong, President of Northwest University, went to Chongqing to discuss the issue of relocating the university with the Ministry of Education and attended the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee. In mid-March, upon learning that a small number of students at the university, using the pretext of the student union organization issue, had incited a strike that lasted nearly a month, resulting in significant academic losses, he immediately submitted his resignation to the Ministry. He was not granted permission to resign and was temporarily allowed to return to the university to handle the disturbance.

Returning to the University to Persuade

He returned to the university on March 26th to persuade the students, and classes soon resumed in full. In early April, a guidance committee for the student union was established, resolving to provide reasonable guidance for the student union. It was believed that the student union issue could be brought to a close with this guidance. He then submitted his resignation to the Ministry a second time and temporarily refrained from going to the university to work. Upon hearing this, all faculty and staff of the university sent a telegram to Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Education, urging him to retain Liu Jihong. The student representatives of each class also passed a resolution to retain President Liu. Subsequently, Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Education telegraphed back to the university's faculty and staff and also telegraphed Liu Jihong, urging him to shoulder the difficult task and not entertain the idea of resigning again.

Outbreak of Riot

Unexpectedly, on April 15th, a small number of students started a riot. At that time, about a hundred people stormed into the university headquarters, forcibly confiscated the weapons of the university police, seized the official seals, forcibly occupied the offices, surrounded the president, and coerced him to leave the university. They also issued announcements and declarations without authorization and broke into the College of Law and Commerce, seizing guns and seals. That evening, the deans, department heads, and faculty representatives of the university held an emergency university affairs meeting and decided to collectively resign from their positions in support of the president, standing with the president through thick and thin. All the professors also signed their names to express their unified stance with their colleagues in the university affairs meeting. After the president left the university, the school fell into a state of chaos. These students took it upon themselves to guard the gates, collectively occupied the auditorium, opened the storage rooms, used public property, posted absurd slogans everywhere, confused public opinion, stabbed classmates, and created terror. The seriousness of the situation and the cruelty of their actions were unprecedented in student unrest.

Rising Up to Protect the University

However, the majority of the pure-hearted students, seeing that the established principles were being destroyed and the university was in imminent danger, expressed deep indignation. That evening, they spontaneously gathered and resolved to protect the university. On April 17th, a general meeting was held to establish the university protection group, and over eight hundred students signed up to protect the university, accounting for more than half of the entire student body. On the morning of the 19th, members of the university protection group set off in two groups. One group went to the city to post slogans, and the other group went to the College of Law and Commerce to defend it. The alumni association also actively assisted. When the university held registration at the College of Law and Commerce, all except for the students who had left the university and a few malcontents enthusiastically registered, totaling over a thousand people (the total number of students at the university was one thousand one hundred and seventeen). The dozens of malcontents, who occupied the university headquarters for a week, eventually disintegrated internally due to lack of support and fled on the night of the 22nd.

Investigating in Accordance with the Law

Among them, twenty people were arrested on the 23rd and transferred to the court for investigation in accordance with the law. When this disturbance occurred, the faculty and staff of the university resolved to unanimously support the president and stand with him through thick and thin, and they expressed their opinions to the Ministry of Education. At that time, the Ministry responded in a telegram, saying: "To Dean Zhao and all the teachers of Northwest University in Chenggu, your deleted telegram has been received. Regarding the disturbance at the university, Inspector Zhou Hongben and Cai Ruoshui have been dispatched to handle it, and President Liu has been telegraphed to return to the university as soon as possible to investigate the ringleaders and punish them severely. It is hoped that you will assist the president in resolving the disturbance and not entertain the idea of resigning again. [Signed] Ministry of Education, Mao You." Currently, President Liu has returned to the university, everything has returned to normal, and the semester and graduation exams are being held as scheduled. The relocation of the university is also underway, and the morale of the teachers and students is exceptionally united. They all hope that President Liu will continue his efforts and develop the university's affairs.

### The Student Strike at Two Classes of the National Capital Provisional University; A Resolution is Expected; Remedial Classes Have Already Taken the Exam as Scheduled; Preparatory Classes Will Reschedule the Exam for Another Day

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing by this Newspaper] In the remedial classes and preparatory classes of National Capital Provisional University, a small number of students in each class have been on strike demanding solutions to the distribution problem, while also coercing other students to do the same, creating opposition between students who did not want to take the exam and students who wanted to take the exam. The professors of the remedial classes, protecting the general body of students who wanted to take the exam, took appropriate measures, and on the afternoon of the 24th, everyone took the exam peacefully. The faculty and staff of the preparatory classes have been holding meetings with students for days, mediating the situation, and it is expected that the exam will be held soon. The situations of the two classes are described separately below:

Remedial Classes

A small number of students, several dozen, in this class insisted on not participating in the exam until the distribution problem was satisfactorily resolved and attempted to coerce the entire student body. They planned to hold a general student meeting at the auditorium at 8:00 AM on the 24th. The professors, considering the auditorium to be the examination hall, made preparations in advance. The several dozen students who did not want to take the exam originally planned to break into the auditorium, but they were stopped by the professors. They only shouted slogans, saying that the students taking the exam had no conscience. The students taking the exam were not stopped by the students who did not want to take the exam in front of the Jinling University gate. Because the professors and the inspectors sent by the Ministry of Education, Ding Xianzeng, Sun Aitang, and Chen Zongying, were exam proctors, they gave sincere guidance to these few students on the spot, and the students were moved. The professors' association also allowed students who did not participate in the exam in the morning to take a make-up exam. When the reporter arrived at the class in the afternoon, he first saw a public notice from the student union stating that the food problem had been resolved and that the distribution problem had been guaranteed by Professor Liu Ying on behalf of the professors' association (according to the professors, students who pass the exam can naturally be guaranteed distribution). They hoped that students who did not participate in the exam in the morning would come to register for a make-up exam. Subsequently, he saw candidates lined up in the auditorium, all taking the exam. The three inspectors from the Ministry of Education were supervising the exam in the examination hall, and the order was excellent. According to Director Wang Shulin, two-thirds of the students took the exam at 8:00 AM in the morning. After the professors' persuasion, the students expressed their acceptance, and the number of students taking the exam in the afternoon was even more enthusiastic. It is expected that the examination schedule will be completed by June 1st, and it is believed that it can be carried out to the end.

Preparatory Classes

For several days, over sixty students in this class have been taking the exam, while the rest, the majority who wanted to take the exam, were coerced and unable to take the exam. Only a very small number did not advocate taking the exam. On the evening of the 23rd, the faculty and staff proposed that students who had already taken the exam for two days should, starting next week (the 27th), take the exam together with the other students. The intention was to temporarily suspend the examination work on the 24th and concentrate their efforts to provide concrete guidance to the striking students in order to have the entire class take the exam on the 27th. However, the sixty students who had already taken the exam for several days believed that they had taken risks, been scolded, and left their dormitories to take the exam, so they should continue to take the exam. How could they accommodate those who had not taken the exam? Therefore, the order in which students took the exam and whether or not they took the exam created opposition. All the professors spent the entire day of the 24th talking and persuading the students about this matter. At 5:00 PM, the director of the class, Luo Yizeng, went to the Ministry of Education and invited Inspector Peng Baichuan to the class to hold a meeting with the professors to discuss solutions. According to general observation, since the students in the remedial classes have already completely taken the exam, the preparatory classes may also be able to continue the exam soon. (Foolish)

### Five Professors of Guangxi University Go to Wuzhou Together to Persuade Students; The Majority of Students are Willing to Obey Government Orders

[Special Dispatch from Liuzhou by this Newspaper] Previously, due to the relocation of the university, a portion of the students of National Guangxi University advocated returning to the old site in Wuzhou and automatically left the university to go to Wuzhou. The university administration had previously stated that it was ordered to designate Guilin as the permanent site and could not make its own decisions. Since the new President Chen Jianxiao took office, he immediately actively carried out the relocation work, aiming to have all classes return to Guilin by the end of May. In order to take into account the academic future of the students in Wuzhou, he requested the Dean of the College of Law and Commerce Wang Qin, the Dean of the College of Science and Engineering Zheng Jianxuan, the Dean of the College of Agriculture Wang Zhenru, the Head of the Department of Electrical Engineering Qiu Xianzun, and Professor of Public Subjects Huang Xianfan to go to Wuzhou together to persuade them properly and distribute travel expenses for returning to Guilin.

### Alumni of the College of Agriculture of Peiping University Launch a Movement to Restore the College; Alumni of the Medical College Also Express Interest in Restoring the College

[Dispatch from Peiping by this Newspaper] Following the movement for the independence of the College of Engineering, alumni of the College of Agriculture of Peiping University in Peiping have launched a movement to restore the college. Their reason is that the qualification of the president of Peiping University has not yet expired, and the colleges have never received a clear order of dissolution. They advocate for the simultaneous restoration of the colleges with universities such as Tsinghua and Nankai.

Peiping Side

On the 20th of this month, they sent representatives to visit Director Li of the Peiping Military Headquarters to request that he forward their request to the Ministry of Education for permission to restore the college. They were received by Secretary-General Xiao, who was particularly willing to convey their request. It is learned that the alumni association of the Medical College of the university is also planning to request the Ministry of Education to restore the Medical College for the same reason.

[Dispatch from This City] The College of Agriculture of National Peiping University, formerly Beijing Agricultural University, has been operating for over forty years. After the outbreak of war, the school moved west and temporarily merged with the Northwest Agricultural College. The Ministry of Education has repeatedly stated that it will decide to restore the school after the end of the war. Now that victory has been over a year, there is still no concrete plan for restoration, which has caused great concern among alumni everywhere.

Shanghai Side

Over seventy graduating classmates of the school who remained in Shanghai, including Mei Xuefang, Li Zhengyi, and Li Xiangyuan, recently gathered to discuss ways to restore the school and decided to respond to the school restoration movement of alumni everywhere. Their emotions were very strong. They also sent representatives to Beijing to petition and make three requests to the Ministry of Education: (1) Restore it as an independent College of Agriculture or Agricultural University; (2) All former faculty and staff should be invited back to the school; (3) The original school site must not be encroached upon by other schools.

### Reply to Readers: Legal Questions

(1) Zhu Buyun asks: I have been in the army for ten years, and lost contact due to the fall of Wuhan. This time, my wife sent a letter saying: "Last year, on the orders of my father, I gave my eldest brother's son to you as your heir," etc. Now I have several questions, please advise! (1) Is the previous situation legally valid? (2) If, after demobilization from fighting the enemy, I have children, how should the inheritance of property be exercised? (3) Are there any separate laws that exempt me from the above restrictions due to being in a war zone or a soldier on expedition? (4) What kind of procedures should be followed to break this relationship?

[Lawyer Zhu Yakui answers] (1) The current Civil Code has abolished patriarchal inheritance, so there is no such thing as an "adopted son." As for adopting a child, if you have a spouse, you should do it together. Your wife adopted one for you without your consent, which is naturally invalid. (2) If you have children in the future, when the inheritance begins, the estate will naturally be inherited by your children. (3) There are no such separate laws. (4) To terminate the adoption relationship, if the requirements listed in Article 1081 of the Civil Code are met, you should seek a court judgment.

(2) A loyal reader from Wuxi asks: Mr. So-and-so died in 1939 at the age of 50, leaving behind a house. In 1941, his wife sold it with a written agreement. At that time, his eldest son was in military academy, participating in the war at the front; the second son was at home; and the youngest son was in middle school. None of them signed the agreement. Now the three brothers intend to deny the sale of this house and plan to negotiate: (1) The mother sold the estate of the father, and the sons are all of legal age, but did not sign the agreement on the spot. Can they raise an objection? (2) Originally, the sale of this house was supposed to be an exchange for farmland, but it was later changed to a cash payment. Due to the delay in payment, the high inflation rate caused a significant loss. Can they now seek compensation? (3) The acquirer is a Buddhist follower and uses evil forces, suspected of coercing signatures and bullying the orphaned and widowed. The house has now been demolished and rebuilt as the site of a Buddhist transportation association. At that time, it was impossible to appeal during the enemy occupation. How should they start negotiations now? (4) The eldest son is now working in the Ministry of Military Affairs and has sent a letter instructing us to publish a warning in the newspaper and raise an objection. Is it legal and effective?

[Lawyer Zhu Yakui answers] (1) The estate is jointly owned. If the consent of all joint owners is not obtained, the disposition is invalid. (2) Since the contract is invalid, there is no question of compensation for damages. (3) Seek a court judgment. (4) A lawsuit should be filed according to law to resolve the matter.

(3) Zhang Hao asks: A neighbor's daughter in my hometown has reached the legal age for marriage. After three years of marriage, due to disagreements between the couple, they cannot grow old together. She ran away last winter and has been hiding elsewhere for more than three months, living as someone's mistress. The husband has been unable to find her. Recently, I heard that the woman and her lover have asked lawyer Chen Wenju to represent them in suing the Shanghai District Court, claiming abuse, etc., and requesting a divorce. The defendant received a court summons and immediately hired a defense lawyer to attend. The first hearing was held, but the defendant did not appear in court. Now I have several questions: (1) Both parties reside in Qingyi, can the Shanghai District Court transfer the case to the Qingpu County government for mediation? (2) Can the plaintiff's mother and brother be implicated? (3) Can the defendant claim compensation for all losses from the plaintiff and her mother and brother?

[Lawyer Zhu Yakui answers] Since the matters you inquired about have already been sued and both parties have entrusted lawyers to act as agents in the litigation, you should wait quietly for the court's judgment, and it is not convenient to provide speculative answers.

Around 10:00 AM, the Bank of China allocated 256 taels of gold to gold businesses and silversmiths at the original price of 1.845 million. It was extremely stable afterward. In the forenoon, it slightly rose to 1.86 million, but at noon it still fell to around 1.84 million. The afternoon was even quieter, and the final price was down 20,000 from the previous closing. Gold ornaments were 194,000. Silver sycee and silver dollars slightly rebounded. The underground money market was even more rampant, with interest rates as low as 1.2 fen.

The US dollar weakened slightly. It opened at 2350 yuan in the morning and was offered for sale, once falling to 2325, before rebounding slightly. However, it was difficult to exceed the morning's high. At noon, it struggled below 2340 yuan, and there were no special changes in the afternoon. The final price was down another 20 yuan from the previous closing. Hong Kong dollars still had difficulty gaining momentum, and the final price was down another 5 yuan. Hong Kong Telegraph was 415 to 425 yuan, Rupees were 525 yuan. The exchange rate between US dollars and US Dollar remittances was stable.

### Amid Positive News, Government Bonds Reach New Highs

Government bond prices continued to be bid up. The market deeply expected the release of various positive news at the beginning of next month. Series C opened in the morning and immediately continued the momentum from the previous day, jumping to above 7600 yuan, before some people took profits. After the opening, it once fell back slightly to 7400 yuan, but it was soon boosted again. At noon, it rose again to above 7800 yuan. The final price was up 500 yuan from the previous closing.

### Yarn Market Sales Are Very Brisk: Spot Cotton Trading Begins

Yesterday, the yarn market was stable and the line plain yarn was firm. Because customers from Hankou and Jingwu had a strong appetite for 20-count yarn, brands such as Double Horse, Fengnian, Flying Boat, and 16-count Guangming all rose by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Due to the fact that the Fangjian Company slightly offered 42-count double-strand thread on Friday, there was no power to increase the price, and the price was very mediocre. There were not many transactions throughout the day.

The New York cotton market rose by 15 to 18 points. The near-term American dollar price was 27.78, the forward price was 28.42, and the Mittling spot price was 28.38. Spot cotton trading began in this port. Private yarn factories such as Shenxin No. 1 Factory, Jiafeng, Dasheng, etc., all made purchases.

Ordinary five-dan goods traded at 1.8 million to 1.85 million yuan. Dried warp transactions were sparse. Bids were 40,000 to 50,000 yuan lower than the previous day. The silk fabric market was more solid. Since today is Sunday, payments must be made the day after tomorrow, so selling prices were slightly higher.

### The Rice Market Forms a Stalemate and Prices Are Not Easy to Lower: The City Government Will Convene a Meeting Tomorrow to Discuss Ways to Smooth Rice Supply

It is reported that in addition to strictly controlling food transactions and investigating warehouse stocks, the municipal government specifically scheduled a meeting to encourage the purchase and transportation of food at 3:00 PM on Monday, the 27th, in the municipal government conference room to discuss solutions.

In order to formulate countermeasures, the Rice Market Management Committee has scheduled an emergency joint meeting of the directors and supervisors of the Bean and Rice Industry Association, the Rice and Food Distribution Industry, and the Rice Shop Industry at 9:00 AM today (the 26th) to discuss effective measures.

Spot Checks on Businesses

Yesterday, a reporter visited Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, and inquired about matters related to food. He said: The numbers of grain merchants and warehouse stocks registered have been compiled and sent to the bureau by the relevant associations, but the numbers are quite complicated and have not yet been completely sorted out. There are also a small number of reports that have not been submitted yet, and are still being urged. In order to ensure that the information reported by the grain merchants is accurate and without concealment, the bureau will conduct spot checks and reward citizens for reporting. Once the city's inventory registration is completed and the numbers are compiled, the bureau will report to the municipal government.

Rice Price Stalled

Yesterday, the rice market was stalled because customers believed that the cost of producing rice in the producing areas was too high and transportation was not smooth, and shops believed that prices were too high and sales were difficult. Flour sales were sporadic, rising again by 500 to 600 yuan to 700 to 800 yuan. The new wheat may be harvested within two weeks. The oil market had a large supply, but sales were normal, and prices were weak, falling by more than 1,000 yuan. Corn in Qingdao suddenly became disinterested and fell back by 1,000 yuan.

However, the total amount arriving was said to be around 15,000 shi. These rice merchants only publicly registered one-third of their total arrivals with the market. Although the other two-thirds were not registered, they were still traded in the market. Although this situation is not of great concern, it affects the rice market's arrival statistics to some extent.

### Chinese Stock Black Market: Yongsha Unmatched, Rumors of One Free Nine After Capital Increase

Yongsha is still the target of speculation in the Chinese stock market. The market frequently spread the good news of "one free nine" (the market price is expected to be 700 yuan after the capital increase). In the future, the amount of offsetting will be relaxed, because the floor price has been reduced to one-tenth, ranking it among small stocks. It should be welcomed by the public. Buying sentiment is pervasive, with no retreat. Other stocks remain in a passive position, and small stocks feel even more inadequate. Yongsha and American Asia both closed higher than they opened. Jingfu and other three small stocks could not sustain high prices and fell back slightly at closing. As a result, Yongsha rose by 10% alone, American Asia was up 350 yuan, and Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing rose slightly. The rest also rose slightly. However, the veteran stocks remained the same. The bidding price after the close was still upward. Foreign stocks had risen for many days. Yesterday, there were many floating profits and they were closed. Yisha fell from 14,500 yuan and British United fell from 13,100 yuan, but the results were still more stable than the previous closing. The less popular stocks had mixed fortunes.

### The Cloth Market Is Increasingly Strong

The sales of grey cloth to the north are still strong, and the dyeing factories in this street are also purchasing, so the market atmosphere is becoming stronger. Colored cloth is being purchased sporadically from Hunan, Shanxi, Sichuan, Fujian, Guangdong and other places, so people's hearts are firm. Yesterday, Fangjian Company listed 12-pound fine cloth up 2,000 yuan, and other Shi Lin bleached cloth increased by 1,000 yuan. However, except for popular goods, there was not much change in printed cloth. The market situation continued to be strong in the afternoon. The price of 12-pound Longtou cloth was 52,000 yuan, and the price of 3A colored balls was 49,500 yuan, an increase of 1,000 yuan compared to the morning.

### Sugar Spot Is Scarce

Yesterday, the goods opened by the new company could not be released until next Tuesday, so spot goods were still scarce and prices were tight again. The association's market price for medium white sugar was initially 71,000 yuan, then 1,500 yuan and 2,000 yuan, and in the afternoon it reached 73,000 yuan, an increase of more than 2,000 yuan. Raw sugar was 60,000 yuan.

### Brazilian Tea Production Increases

[Reuters, Brazilian Capital, 25th] Because the global tea supply continues to be short, Brazil's increased tea production is particularly important. The 1945 output is estimated at 1.5 million pounds, three times the average output between 1935 and 1939. In the past five years, output has been increasing year by year. More than half of last year's tea exports were sold to South American countries. The tea industry in the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil is particularly developed.

### Tianjin Exchange Industry Is Not Allowed to Buy and Sell US Dollars

Tianjin News, there are a total of 63 exchange businesses in Tianjin. They used to buy and sell currencies and securities of various countries under the name of cigarette shops or ticket shops. Recently, they have mainly engaged in the buying and selling of US dollars. The Central Bank believes that the buying and selling of foreign currencies is related to foreign exchange and should be strictly managed to prevent malpractices. All exchange businesses have not obtained the Class A permit to operate in accordance with the Provisional Regulations on Foreign Exchange Management. It is specially stipulated that from the 20th of this month, they are not allowed to engage in the buying and selling of foreign currency banknotes. From now on, the buying and selling of US dollars and other foreign currency banknotes is only permitted to be operated by the 22 banks that have obtained the Class A permit.

### Double-Scented Jasmine: Tianjin Merchants Have Strong Demand, Market Prices Soar

Fujian jasmine is double-scented with excellent quality, and is most favored by the Tianjin area. Although the demand is currently strong, due to the fact that the inventory in this city is very small and the traffic is bad, activities have been weak in recent days. At present, in order to respond to the urgent need, merchants from that area have come to Shanghai specifically to find goods. As a result, only Dadi Tea Factory sold more than 30 loads, and the price soared to 560,000 yuan per load. The same kind of goods in the store and warehouses in this street and in Suzhou and Wuxi are being sought out, but the supply and demand are balanced, and the overall situation is still lacking in change. As for the foreign tea market, foreign firms such as Indian firms Ruichang and Nianmazhi, although they have the intention to purchase, the owners insist on their prices, and it is difficult to reach an agreement.

### American Hog Bristle Price Falls: US$2.80 per Pound

It is specially engaged in studying methods to improve silk. The committee attaches particular importance to the improvement of silkworm cocoons. It is said that the silk currently in use is only suitable for wartime needs. The fibers are coarse, reaching a thickness of three deniers. However, ordinary demand is only 2.8 deniers. It is expected that when wartime inventory is used up, the reeling industry will adopt a better silkworm cocoon. It is said that the silkworm cocoon is made from silkworms of a better breed.

[Our Newspaper's Report] The classification of industrial and commercial groups has standard regulations issued by the Ministry that can be used as a basis. However, the economic sector in this city is particularly complex. There are many trade unions, and many have a long history. Within an industry, there are often several groups coexisting. Their business objects are either simple or complex, and it is often difficult to match them with the standard regulations issued by the Ministry. After the victory, the Social Affairs Bureau began to reorganize the various public groups. Firstly, the procedures were too complicated, and there was no time to reorganize them separately. Secondly, due to the election, they did not want to spend too much time, which would hinder the election. Therefore, the above situations still could not be eliminated. Now that the election is over, and the reorganization work has basically come to an end, it is scheduled to convene the relevant groups on a daily basis from tomorrow to discuss reasonable merger or analysis methods. At the same time, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce will be invited to send representatives to participate and discuss together in order to seek compromise.

### Changchun Twenty-Nine Days (8)

—Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, Shao Dianzhi

Since we eight reporters have lost our freedom, we have no choice but to stay indoors. We still have to wait for the facts to prove whether the Communist army's concern for our "safety" is in good faith. Behaviors such as the Communist army shooting at our residence and threatening us with bayonets do not seem to be intentional orders given to them by superiors, as they said, "protection." The nerves of journalists are quite sensitive. We are closely watching the new changes.

### A Record of Collective Starvation

Communist soldiers and political instructors barge into rooms at will, constantly disturbing work. Whether they have business or not, they always want you to keep them company and chat. Because of the language barrier, it was a minor inconvenience to the five American colleagues, but it was a thorough nuisance to us.

After Rick came back, everyone heard that we were going to move and felt that this kind of change was not a favorable omen. Since we already felt "safe" enough with the guns protecting us for the sake of our "safety," there was no need to move. We didn't know where we were moving to, and on one hand, we felt suspicious, while on the other hand, we felt calm because we had good reasons to refuse his proposal. We also blamed each other for being too paranoid, misinterpreting good intentions, or that it was just casual talk that shouldn't cause unnecessary concerns. The next day, everyone forgot about it.

We found a copy of *Steamed Longevity Records of the Three Kingdoms* and *Notes from the Thatched Hall of Close Observation* in the house to amuse ourselves. Each person's work was just writing some notes, reading a few pages, and eating three meals. The sound of gunfire outside never stopped. Every American colleague learned to say "eat" and shout "kid," and the accurate pronunciation of our handyman's name was the most important thing.

In the afternoon, Liu Qiren came and said that it was already 4:30 PM, and Zhou Baozhong had originally invited everyone (including Rick and his driver, Pont) to dinner at 4:00 PM to talk to everyone. Now half an hour had passed. The car was waiting outside, so please get in the car. He also said that Mayor Zhao Junyu would also be invited. Liu Qiren would not attend due to other business.

We asked him where we were having dinner, and he replied that it was at the Yamato Hotel. We did not know the time and place of Zhou Baozhong's dinner beforehand. Since it was a "banquet," everyone had to shave and wash their faces. Abena had to put on some lipstick, so we had to ask Liu Qiren to wait ten minutes.

Liu Qiren said goodbye to us, and we took two cars straight to the Yamato Hotel, guarded by Communist soldiers. The driver of one car drove to another hotel without a guide, going to the wrong place. Rick, who originally lived in the Yamato Hotel, saw that it wasn't far away, so he got out of the car and walked three or four hundred meters. There were several Communist soldiers guarding the entrance of the Yamato Hotel. When we got out of the car, we saw one of the Communist soldiers who had escorted us wearing a mask made of a torn American flag. Lippmann watched for a while, wanting to say something, but he stopped because of the language barrier.

Walking into the Yamato Hotel, it was quiet and desolate, not at all like there was a banquet going on. A resident, the TASS reporter Petrov, was still there. He was very free. We ran up and down the stairs but didn't see anyone, even though according to Liu Qiren, we were already late, but the host hadn't arrived yet.

Rick said that everyone could rest in his room. We told the Communist soldier who escorted us to notify us when Zhou Baozhong arrived.

Rick's room faced a north-facing window, with two bullet holes in the window and bullets lodged in the wall. This was the result of the battle a few days ago. Rick arrived on the 13th on Stimson's small plane, and the pilot Pont lived in the same room as him. They originally planned to go to Harbin but unexpectedly got stuck here. Now ten people were crammed together in this room, making it difficult to move around. After waiting for a while, an adjutant came in and said that Commander Zhou was busy and had already driven back to pick him up. After waiting for a while, a letter signed by Zhou Baozhong was suddenly sent. The letter was addressed to the world and said:

"I believe it would be more convenient for you and the other American journalists to move to the old Yamato Hotel. It should have been moved this afternoon at 4:00, but the receptionist I sent to the hotel didn't make contact. Therefore, I troubled you to make an empty trip. Now, I still request that you and the other American journalists move to the 'Yamato' Hotel!"

Changes came, but we didn't make an empty trip at all; we were all waiting in Rick's room. We said, "Zhou Baozhong invited us to dinner, not to move. We didn't bring our belongings. We hope this matter can be decided after dinner."

The adjutant said, "Each of your rooms is already prepared. You can go and rest first. You don't need to go back. Your belongings can be moved for you. We will settle you down and then invite him over."

We said, "No, nothing can be touched without our permission. Lawman needs to see Zhou Baozhong now."

The adjutant said, "It can be left untouched. Commander Zhou is completely responsible for your safety. What attitude do you have towards this kindness?" His tone was completely threatening.

We said coldly, "We are only prepared to come for dinner now."

"Okay, I'll drive back and find him again."

Half an hour later, another Communist soldier came and said that refreshments had been prepared in the reception room downstairs. Please go downstairs to have some refreshments first because they knew everyone was hungry. Commander Zhou would be here right away. At this time, Rick went downstairs to take a look and came back and said there were no refreshments. The adjutant insisted on asking everyone to leave here and said that everything would be prepared once we went downstairs. Everyone was extremely annoyed, but they had to calm down and endure.

Lippmann, who was lying on the floor at this time, slowly got up, lit his pipe, and said, "According to American rules, guests shouldn't eat before the host arrives. We'll eat when Commander Zhou comes."

Rick was talking to everyone at this time, and the adjutant interrupted again, making Rick angry:

"Shut up! I'm talking to other people." After finishing what he had to say to everyone, he said to the adjutant who came over, "I am an American diplomat, you should be more polite to me, do you understand?"

"Understood," he replied.

"Good, then I'm telling you now," he looked at his watch and continued, "General Zhou Baozhong invited guests today, but we American children have been waiting for four hours. We are all extremely hungry. I am now expressing to you that I am very unhappy," Rick, as an American official, protested on behalf of all Americans.

We Chinese reporters were more tolerant than the Americans. We only hoped to see Zhou Baozhong so that we could exchange opinions directly with him. The adjutant saw that we didn't agree to move, didn't agree to go to the "prepared" rooms to rest, and didn't agree to go to the reception room to "have refreshments." Everyone insisted that because Zhou Baozhong invited us to dinner, we had to wait for the host. We just squeezed into Rick's room, playing word association games. Beckett fell asleep in bed. After a while, Abena was also silent. Shen Zhi, Shi Xun, Lippmann, and the driver Pont lay on the floor, their stomachs aching from hunger, but no one said they were hungry. There were no lights, only a candle, its light dim. Everyone talked about fun things, ignoring the adjutant. The adjutant stood for a while and said to himself, "Okay, I'll drive back and pick up the commander."

### A Midnight Meal

After another hour, the adjutant came and said that Zhou Baozhong was downstairs, asking everyone to come down.

Some had already fallen asleep and were awakened one by one, their eyes drowsy, not knowing what time it was. Everyone was overjoyed as if they had been granted amnesty and ran downstairs happily. Rick was the last to leave, as if he was leading him.

We walked to a small restaurant on the second floor. There was a pile of soldiers at the door. We couldn't see clearly how many there were in the dark. They were probably on guard duty. Only one of the two doors of the restaurant was open. When we walked in, we saw a man of medium build wearing a black Zhongshan suit with a long, round face and many blemishes. It shone darkly in the candlelight. This was General Zhou Baozhong, the current garrison commander.

He shook hands with each of us, and we exchanged names. Food had indeed been prepared in the restaurant, and it was Russian Western food (the Yamato Hotel always served this kind of Western food). We sat down immediately. Zhou Baozhong and Abena sat at one end, Shen Zhi and Beckett sat at the other end, and the rest sat on either side, three on one side and four on the other, as shown in the diagram:

Most of the food on the table was pickled, cold and hard. Shen Zhi and Beckett didn't wait for the host to speak and started eating preserved meat first. After eating half a plate, Zhou Baozhong stood up and gave an opening speech, saying that he was very happy to meet the American friends and Chinese brothers because he was busy. He then expressed his condolences to everyone for being frightened during the war but didn't say why this "banquet" was held so late at night. We raised our glasses and drank vodka, followed by beer, and ate cold food.

Lippmann, a mischievous guy, suggested that Abena represent everyone in proposing a toast to Zhou Baozhong. Everyone agreed, but Abena said, "I don't drink alcohol from a young age, but I'm very happy to meet General Zhou today and I'm willing to drink a glass."

Then Zhou introduced himself, saying that he was a Communist Party member who had served as a regimental commander during the Northern Expedition and fought in Nanjing. After 1927, he studied and researched some issues. He had been to San Francisco and Moscow. He obtained a radio in San Francisco. Before the September 18th Incident, he went to the Northeast and had not left for fourteen years. He used this radio to listen to San Francisco broadcasts. The Anti-Japanese Allied Army he led, although blockaded by the Japanese army and even completely hiding its armed activities, could not block the news of the world from the United States. After more than ten years, he saw American friends for the first time today. The United States contributed the most in this war, so he wanted to toast to the United States and Truman, especially Abena, who traveled across the ocean from the West to the East as an American woman. He thought she was brave, so he also wanted to toast to American women.

Abena shook her head and said, "No, not brave at all. It's brave to drink a toast."

Zhou Baozhong believed that we Chinese reporters were important. The Americans were outsiders after all, and no matter what, they were separated from the Chinese people's own affairs. We also toasted.

We were hungry but drank cold wine, which was extremely uncomfortable. Our stomachs felt like they were cut open with a knife, and eating cold food felt like adding salt to the wound.

At this time, Beckett fell asleep next to Shen Zhi, snoring loudly. He once claimed to be a cat. Shen Zhi and Lippmann made faces at each other but finally woke him up. From then on, he kept his eyelids open to maintain a posture that didn't look like he was sleeping, but his expression was sad, making others feel sorry for him. He would show this sad face whenever something bored him.

Rick asked Zhou Baozhong that he planned to hunt in the Northeast and wondered what kind of wild animals he could get.

Zhou replied, "There are many forests in the Northeast, and there are many wild animals. In the past, when we were besieged by the Japanese army, we often hunted to feed ourselves."

Abena asked, "Have you hunted tigers too?"

"Yes, we have." This was the answer.

Zhou also talked about the unforgettable experience of hunting deer, saying that this was the time to hunt deer. The male deer grows antlers. The doe is in front when traveling to protect the male deer's antlers. When the antlers are fully grown in winter, the male deer protects the doe. Then they talked about the types of wild animals and Rick's plane. Rick's Stinson plane was not destroyed.

Zhou told the reporters that we lost our freedom entirely for our safety. Otherwise, the Communist Party couldn't bear the responsibility. He also announced: "The Democratic Allied Army formally occupied Changchun on the 19th." Zhou commanded this attack on Changchun. Regarding Guan Yaqu's use of trains to transport troops from Dehui, Zhou's response was already included in the "Seeing Off Erno" section above. Zhou also said, "We don't go where the Soviet army is, for fear that others will think we are colluding with them. The Soviet army once confiscated our guns, and the relationship was extremely bad."

After talking about this and that for two hours, it was almost time to leave. We were just waiting to hear the final conclusion. When we were eating, the door was crowded with Communist soldiers, and there were also seven or eight in the restaurant. The conclusion finally came. Zhou Baozhong said:

"Tonight, I hope you will stay at the Yamato Hotel. It will be more convenient for us to contact each other in the future, and at the same time, it would be inconvenient for us to send another group of people to protect you there, saving trouble. What do you think?"

Everyone immediately shook their heads and said, "No." Shen Zhi pulled Beckett, whose eyes widened slightly at this time.

"Then what about you Chinese brothers?"

We shook our heads again and said, "No." So Zhou Baozhong immediately asked for the reasons. Here are our reasons:

(1) The original house is very comfortable, like living in our own home.

(2) There is hot water, cold water, you can take a bath, and there is a kitchen to cook Chinese food. The chef used to be Wu Dasuai's chef, and the food is extremely well made.

(3) Today is a dinner invitation, and nothing has been packed, everything is casually thrown there.

(4) We also hope to invite you to dinner at our own home once.

But Zhou Baozhong hesitated for a while and said:

"I'm afraid there have already been some changes in your residence, right?"

Everyone felt that this sentence was very strange but said:

"We believe there won't be."

So Zhou Baozhong agreed to send us back to our residence. We invited him to eat at our "home" at 8:00 PM on the 24th. He agreed, and we still took the car he sent back to our residence. It was exactly 12:30 AM, and nothing in the house had changed.

We had all acted in a play again.

Zhou Baozhong did not come to the reporters' residence on the 24th. At 5:00 PM, we received a letter from him, which read:

"I will leave Changchun City for Siping Street at 6:00 PM tonight. I may return tomorrow. I am grateful for the kindness of the Chinese and foreign reporters, and I am sorry for the cancellation of the dinner at 8:00 PM due to official business. Please forgive me. I will come to pay my respects again when I return from Siping Street. Today, a special agent set fire to a warehouse at the train station. A landmine exploded at the Xiehe Hall, which was buried by the puppet army's Tieshi unit. Civilians triggered it, causing a major disaster. Last night, I received a message from the Northeast Bureau of our Central Committee, forwarded from the US Consulate in Shenyang, inquiring about the safety of Major Rick and the American reporters and how their lives are guaranteed. I have also reported to our Northeast Bureau regarding my own responsibilities. I hereby inform you."

On the evening of the 25th, from 8:00 PM, we talked until 12:30 AM. He brought a secretary surnamed Zhou who could understand English. This was the first time he brought a translator. Later, we learned that he was a reporter for the Xinhua News Agency. Xinhua News Agency reporters naturally worked freely.

On the morning of the 21st, which was also the day we sent the protest letter to Zhou Baozhong, Captain Liu, wearing civilian clothes, quietly went upstairs and said, "The Eighth Route Army guards in our small house have suddenly all left. Should we take out the guns we buried in the coal?" He asked Shi Xun for his opinion. Shi Xun translated this to several American colleagues, and they rushed downstairs like a swarm of bees to visit the small house where we had been concerned about our safety. Sure enough, all the guards inside had left, but we saw large pancakes as hard as iron left on the table.

We cautiously walked out of the gate, but we heard the sound of emergency assembly everywhere. At the same time, there was sporadic gunfire in the west. We knew this was another "change." Beckett went to the high point of the balcony upstairs to see, but he saw many "Eighth Route" soldiers with bayonets running urgently in all directions, running from Datong Square. We couldn't hear anything. Two Eighth Route soldiers hurrying past our wall shouted as they walked, one saying, "Damn it, it's flooded again." "Flooded" meant that a certain part had been attacked again.

### At the Xunyang Riverbank

— A Dispatch from Jiujiang, 19th [of the month] by Liming

At the Xunyang Riverbank, gusts of river wind are busily welcoming and sending off passengers. Every pier and every ship is always crowded with people coming and going. Here, there are newly appointed officials arriving, honorable people returning to their hometowns, and dejected Japanese prisoners of war being sent back to their country. All kinds of people come and go in droves.

In the southern corner of the city, there are two lakes, an inner and an outer: one is Gantang, and the other is Nanmen, which is the only scenic area in the city. There is a small dam between the two lakes, and slender willows sway in the wind on the dam. The lake water is as clear as a mirror, surrounded by the city area and the original dam. The lake water is just a silence. Looking at the mountain area, the lights are like fishing fires. Under this scene, it is easiest to arouse people's infinite thoughts. The entire Gantang Lake undulates in silence.

Jiujiang—the only commercial port in Jiangxi Province, the throat of the whole province, was once one of the three major rice markets and one of the three major tea markets in China. Since being brutally ravaged by the Japanese invaders, it has suffered tremendous losses. Although there are already some government staff recovering the situation, it may take a considerable period of time to restore it to its former glory. On the surface, it seems that commerce is still prosperous, but in reality, it is far from what it used to be. In terms of industry, it can be said that there are no factories. There are only a few small-scale handicraft businesses.

Take the only viable porcelain industry in the city as an example: the main street along Binjiang Road and near the pier can be said to be full of porcelain shops. The number is certainly surprisingly large, but the business is extremely sluggish. Even when ships arrive, some shops are still cold and unable to get customers to visit. The rest of the various businesses are also unusually quiet. Even so, merchants are still struggling hard.

Since Jiujiang's recovery, the rise in special prices has been on the rise. The price of rice rose from two to three thousand yuan per stone after the recovery, and now it is more than thirty thousand yuan per stone. The prices of other commodities have also risen several times or even more than ten times. In addition, various donations and taxes are heavy, and the people are crying endlessly. There are many troops passing through, and the food supply seems to be in short supply, so that people are starving to death due to lack of food. Meningitis has also infected the city recently, and there are many patients. It can be said that they are suffering from poverty and illness.

Let's talk about the cultural circle. Jiujiang will also gradually embark on the road of recovery. Now there are gradually several small newspapers appearing. Of course, this is only a temporary supply, and there should be a large increase and improvement in the future. In the early days of victory, there were no bookstores. Now there are finally one or two. School institutions have also gradually moved in, and a library has also been set up. This has given the people of Jiujiang a unique spiritual food store and medical library. As for entertainment, I heard that there will be a movie soon, and there is only one Peking opera theater. Everything else has just begun to enter the germination period.

### Rice Prices and Salary Increases for Civil Servants

Respected Editor: History's reflection and the evolution of reality both prove that the causes of fortune and misfortune in all human affairs stem from either correct perception or misperception. The former can bring fortune, while the latter can lead to disaster, as the saying goes, "One word can uplift a nation, one word can ruin a nation." Therefore, newspaper reports must be handled with utmost care. Setting aside other matters, please allow me to discuss the recent issues of rice prices and salary increases for civil servants.

Currently, regardless of the individual, when discussing the rice problem, they invariably add a few phrases, such as "lack of supply," "inconvenient transportation," "production not yet recovered," and "high interest rates." Indeed, these are standard formulas in economics. However, a few nights ago, while walking past several rice shops, I saw their goods piled high to the rafters. Overnight, they surged in price like crazy. The next night, walking past again, the situation was the same, but overnight, prices surged again like crazy. The situation on the third and fourth days, of course, need not be mentioned. I ask, which of the above formulas does the current rice price hike conform to as a justification? In reality, they are simply using the facade of the above formulas to exploit opportunities for price fluctuations and satisfy their lust for exorbitant profits. In short, the dire living conditions today are largely caused by human actions. I have also witnessed firsthand how, during a certain instance of speculative fervor, goods suddenly piled up like mountains on sidewalks on both sides of the road, with shouts and entreaties, practically dragging pedestrians into becoming customers. Once the fervor subsided, the situation transformed into a landscape of ruins. But the day before, transportation wasn't completely restored, and the day after, transportation wasn't completely cut off. The day before, factories weren't fully operational, and the day after, factories weren't completely shut down. Those formulas were continuously exploited by them in this manner. Not long ago, our wise measure of rice loans reappeared. As a result, the rice price of 24,500 yuan broke free like a kite with a severed string, drifting further and further away from its intended level, ultimately becoming unrecoverable. And rice merchants even shouted during their meetings: "Cancel the rice loans, and rice will become cheaper!" This alone suggests the underlying complexities. Once the rice loans were indeed canceled, the rice price soared again! The rice loan policy, wavering and indecisive, under the misguided measures of those in charge, ruined a good thing, and the harm has already deepened before the benefits could be seen.

Now, the salary increase for civil servants is one issue, and the competence or incompetence of civil servants is another issue. They should not be confused. If they are redundant staff, they should be eliminated. If they are corrupt, they should be dismissed. If they are superfluous organizations, they should be abolished. Supervision has its own department, and sanctions have their own legal code. As for integrity, diligence, and incorruptibility, these are what public servants should possess. If salaries are increased for these reasons, it is a routine assessment within the normal system, not the salary increase issue we are discussing now. These are two separate matters, not one. The current salary increase issue is about the livelihood of civil servants, which can also be said to be a matter of life and death. It shouldn't wait for requests from below but should be considered by those above in a timely manner. Don't wait until the children are crying from hunger before the parents reflect on their own obligations. This is not about human sentimentality but about responsibility. If you treat life and death as secondary and expect work to continue as usual, then it's hard to justify yourself! Studying on an empty stomach or serving the public on an empty stomach is a spirit of self-encouragement and cannot be expected of everyone. If you cite insufficient financial resources and express sympathy, this is not the tone that those holding the reins of the nation should use as a way to console themselves. As for the argument that salary increases stimulate price increases, why have prices already risen to such an extent when salaries haven't even been increased yet? Let's be frank: it's not that civil servants want salary increases; it's that they are demanding to recover the value lost due to continuous, invisible salary cuts. The other day, a newspaper also published an opinion advocating for layoffs, even if it means disregarding consequences and cutting half the staff first, so that those who remain can immediately receive double the salary. Would this be enough to maintain their livelihoods, or would prices not continue to rise afterward? If prices continue to rise, will another half be cut? If prices continue to rise under the current laissez-faire approach, of course, civil servants' livelihoods will become even more difficult, and of course, there will be more demands for salary increases. It can be seen that this approach may be feasible on one hand, but the livelihood issue on the other hand still needs to be considered.

The authorities should quickly establish effective measures to strictly manage essential goods. Otherwise, a portion of unscrupulous merchants will never stop the merry-go-round of price increases and salary increases in this difficult short period. The last drop of blood from civil servants and the remaining vitality of society will be sucked into the rotating wheel of the merry-go-round without leaving a trace. If they drag the remaining good urban areas into the abyss of unbearable hell, then besides "nationality," I don't know how to resolve "civil rights" and "people's livelihood." The current urgent situation doesn't require extravagant talk of other high-sounding theories. I dare to ask for a concentration of correct understanding, effective measures, and a complete spirit, allowing only correct perception and not allowing misperception, to jointly address the imminent dangers to life.

Xu Xingchi, May 21st

Provision of American Rice: Planning Ahead

Respected Editor: The soaring rice prices in this city are mostly caused by human factors, by collusion between officials and rice merchants, who manipulate prices to their own benefit, leading to this current phenomenon. It is painful to speak of. Rice loans were originally a kind intention of the government. But unfortunately, the handling was not done properly, benefiting only unscrupulous people who profited from them. Every time rice loans were issued, rice prices soared. I wonder if those in authority ask themselves with their hands on their hearts: have they lived up to the poor and suffering people? "Use harsh punishments to govern a chaotic state." A thorough investigation must be conducted, and several people must be executed to appease public anger. Unfortunately, the government is too lenient! Lenient! Lenient! Lenient to the point where the country is unrecognizable! Corruption is rampant everywhere, until we all perish together, which satisfies everyone! According to what your newspaper reported on the 19th of this month, a large shipment of American rice is arriving soon. Whether this is true or not is unknown. If it is indeed the case, please join forces with major newspapers and organizations to vigorously support Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau's proposal to use the Baojia system to provide citizens with rice at low prices. We must not repeat the mistake of throwing it into the tiger's mouth of rice merchants, who receive ten bags of allocated rice, sell half of them, and hoard the other half for profit. In this day and age, gentlemen are in decline, and petty people are in power. A conscientious proposal will often be destroyed by a group of villains who collude to seek private gain. Therefore, major newspapers and organizations must unite to support Director Wu's proposal to prevent it from being undermined by villains. Furthermore, Baojia leaders who handle the allocation of rice to the poor should be given a certain amount of handling fees, which should be included in the rice selling price. This can both curb corruption and prevent those who are willing to serve the public from shrinking back. However, any instances of corruption, adulteration, or adding water, once discovered or reported, will be severely punished and will not be tolerated. (The method: order the village chief to carry a long bamboo pole with a long cloth banner hanging from it, on which is written "Corrupt Bao Leader" or "A Leader" and parade through the city and this Bao for three days, then dismiss them from their position.) Everything succeeds if you plan ahead. If American rice is indeed arriving, convene a meeting of all parties before it arrives to avoid being caught off guard at the last minute. Otherwise, even if there is American rice to help the people, what can be done about the rice merchants who collude with each other and take advantage of the situation! I currently have a slight grasp on my living expenses and am pleading for the people and making a small contribution.

Respectfully, a survivor of hardship, May 20th

Collection of Exit Rice Tax in Qingpu

Respected Editor: Not long ago, the Yaocheng Town, a vital waterway between Qingpu and Shanghai and Songjiang, collected transit taxes from rice merchants, causing opposition from all parties and leading to clashes with boatmen. As a result, this tax was implicitly abolished. Unexpectedly, the Qingpu County authorities recently demanded money on rice again. They established construction promotion committees in various districts of the county. If rice is leaving the area, a tax of two sheng per shi must be paid to obtain a grain transportation certificate. This tax is collected by the rice industry on behalf of the authorities from their customers. Amidst the soaring rice prices, I have several thoughts regarding this tax: (1) The Qingpu District Construction Promotion Committees have achieved considerable success in collecting taxes from grain merchants, but the committees have not shown any progress or plans for "construction." What exactly is being "constructed?" It remains a mystery. (2) The certificates issued by the district committees have a sentence that says, "Hope that the patrol personnel along the way will protect and release." However, the effectiveness of this "protection and release" is somewhat subtle. One of our friends went to Zhujiajiao (the second district of Qingpu County) to purchase rice. He paid the tax and obtained the certificate as required. However, when his rice boat passed through Songze Village on the Shanghai-Qingpu Road, several armed comrades chased after them, inspected the boat, and insisted that his tax payment was insufficient. As a result, they had to offer four dou of unmilled rice before they were allowed to proceed. So much for "protection and release!" (3) Donating two sheng per shi of rice means that the common people who buy rice have to pay for the tax. Isn't this increasing the burden on the common people? On one hand, we want to stabilize rice prices, but on the other hand, we are increasing costs. What is the rationale behind this!

Sincerely, Wensheng

### Lanzhou Weekly

— (May 12th to 18th, Special Correspondent Bingzi)

After the Shanghai Shen Bao newspaper's reprinted edition arrived in Lanzhou, readers generally found it to be light, lively, and very welcome. Daily subscriptions have been extremely enthusiastic.

The price of gold in Lanzhou has risen this week, from 174,000 yuan per tael to a peak of 200,000 yuan. On the 18th, it fell back to 192,000 yuan. The Executive Yuan's allocation of disaster relief grain to Gansu Province has increased to 5,000 tons, and agreement has been reached with the Ministry of Food to have it allocated from Chang'an and other counties in Shaanxi Province.

The Tian-Lan Railway officially commenced construction, decided to start from the 25th.

Gansu-Ningxia-Qinghai Inspector Gao Yihan, Gansu Provincial Chairman Cai Mengjian, Gansu High Court President Ye Zaichou, and others traveled together by car to inspect the counties in southern Gansu. After inspecting Lintan, Zhuoni, and other counties, they arrived in Minxian on the 15th.

The establishment of the Northwest Headquarters greatly inspired various clans. The Jamyang Hutuktu of the Labrang Monastery specially sent the monastery's Grand Zasso Abbot Cang Living Buddha to Lanzhou to offer congratulations.

### Kunqu in Chongqing

— Zhu Taichi

Kunqu opera originated in the Southeast. From the mid-Ming Dynasty to the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods of the Qing Dynasty, it was popular throughout the country. After holding the leading role, it gradually declined. Only in the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang did some of its style and influence remain. Sichuan, located in the remote West, originally had Sichuan opera, which was sharp in tone and refined in lyrics. People in Sichuan flocked to it. People from other provinces preferred Beijing opera. As for Kunqu, few knew its name, let alone learned it. During the war years, Chongqing was not only the center of politics and economics but also a place where culture gathered. Therefore, those who were skilled in this art formed societies with like-minded people to sing and harmonize together in their spare time, so as to maintain this art from decline. It was a grand event. Initially, there was the organization of the Yu Society. In the 30th year of the Republic of China, it was reorganized into the Chongqing Kunqu Society, which gathered many talents and was prosperous for a time. In addition to holding regular monthly gatherings, they also performed several times at the Guotai Theater, the Bank Club, and the Jiangsu Fellow Association. It was rare to hear this heavenly elegant music amidst the turmoil of the war. Therefore, each performance was highly praised. As for the figures in the Kunqu world, the industrialist Mu Ouchu, as an experienced veteran of this art, encouraged the younger generation, and his enthusiasm was no less than in his youth. Unfortunately, he soon died of cancer, leaving the Kunqu friends in Chongqing with a sense of loss. Fan Chongshi and He Jingyuan were two gentlemen who were as enthusiastic about promotion as Ouchu. Both gentlemen were from Sichuan, and at that time, they were both scholarly and fond of Kunqu. They devoted themselves to learning and became masters after several years. Fan played old male roles, and He played young male roles. Although their pronunciation was limited by the local dialect, their vocal strength was experienced and skillful, no different from veteran Kunqu performers. Other Kunqu performers, such as the Xiang Yuancun brothers Shengwu, Zhang Chonghe sisters Yunhe, Xu Yanzhi and Zhang Shanxiang, Ding Zhixiang, Qian Yiyu, Cheng Yunian, Shen Kezhuang, Gan Gongsan, Wang Daozhi, Wang Ziji, and others, were already famous in Beijing and Shanghai and renowned in the Kunqu world. Now, reuniting in a foreign land, they felt even more obliged to contribute. Ni Zongyang and Yao Shengshu were the core members of the Kunqu Society. Both gentlemen were originally disciples of the Xianni Society. Although they have changed professions, the rehearsals and arrangements were impossible without them. As for playing the flute, in addition to the two gentlemen, Xu Yanzhi, Gan Gongsan, and the Xiang brothers could also occasionally share the burden. In addition, due to the reputation spreading, many earnest scholars and ladies from prominent families came to learn, too many to list. Therefore, during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, Kunqu opera became popular in the capital of Chongqing and became a fashion for a time, allowing people from all provinces to appreciate this unique national music. This is all thanks to the members of the Chongqing Kunqu Society. When victory came and people returned to their homes, the Kunqu community in Chongqing scattered, and the grand gatherings were no more, which is very regrettable. It is said that Ni Zongyang is still in Chongqing, presiding over the arts. Mr. Ni will probably have to shoulder the burden alone.

Theater Review

### Watching the First Performance of the "Maple Forest Troupe"

— Wu Ping

The name "Maple Forest Troupe" seems unfamiliar to readers. Indeed, the "Maple Forest Troupe" has not performed in any theater. It is neither a professional troupe nor an amateur troupe but purely a extracurricular troupe formed by students.

The "Maple Forest Troupe" is sponsored by students of the Agricultural Science Department of Linjiang University. They haven't been founded for long, but every student is willing to work hard. Therefore, on the afternoon of the 18th, they finally met the audience for the first time at the "Maple Forest Theater" in the school dormitory at Maple Forest Bridge. Moreover, the performance was very successful.

The preparation for this performance was quite difficult. They didn't have sufficient financial resources, and all the props were borrowed. It is said that the front-of-house director, Mr. Yuan, couldn't sleep well for several nights because of it.

All tickets were complimentary and assigned seating. Therefore, most of the audience were relatives and friends of the students, and the order was very good. The scheduled start time was 7:00 PM, but it was delayed by two hours due to makeup and other reasons. Around 9:00 PM, the curtain was raised amidst enthusiastic applause from the audience.

This performance consisted of three one-act plays. The first was "Suzhou Nocturne" written by Tian Han. The content is: an old calligrapher suffered the ravages of war, destroying his family and all his artistic works. Later, he took up a gun, but in the end, he picked up his writing brush again and took his students to Suzhou to sketch. In Suzhou, he accidentally encountered his lost daughter, who had become a flower girl. When he learned that his old wife had passed away due to poverty, he was overcome with grief and joy, embraced his reunited daughter, and couldn't help but deeply curse the evils of war and poverty.

The second act, "Unmarried Couple," was written by Cao Yu. It tells the story of an engaged but unmarried couple who moved inland with the Anti-Japanese War. The man pretended to be married because the landlord wouldn't rent to single people. The woman wanted to claim to be unmarried because the company wouldn't hire married women. At that time, the woman's superior came to visit, and a dispute arose with the landlord over whether the couple was married or not, and thus a comedy unfolded.

"Tragedy on the Lake," written by Tian Han, was performed last. A passionate young poet reunited with his former lover, who had attempted suicide, on the shore of West Lake. However, when the woman learned that the man already had a wife, she was deeply disappointed and resolutely committed suicide again, unwilling to ruin her lover's happy family.

The above three plays had already received good reviews, so there is no need to elaborate. What needs to be reviewed now is the performance of the "Maple Forest Troupe." Generally speaking, the entire performance was successful. Every actor and staff member was willing to work hard. In particular, the appropriateness of the props, lighting, and makeup was quite remarkable.

Speaking of acting skills, the students, without any stage experience, collaborated and performed for the first time without any stage fright. On the contrary, they showed very experienced acting skills and lifelike expressions, which is commendable. Among them, only one or two actors spoke too softly, and there were a few lines that were said incorrectly or omitted in a hurry, but we cannot erase the entire achievement with these minor flaws.

Finally, with the greatest sincerity, we look forward to every promising actor and staff member of the "Maple Forest Troupe" continuing to work hard and hope to see another more satisfactory performance in the near future.

Play Introduction

### "Old Grievances, New Sorrows"

— He Wei

Playwright: Tao Xiong

Publisher: Wenjiang Bookstore

I remember when Tao Xiong's debut work, "Anti-Spy," was published in Chongqing in the 30th year of the Republic of China, it was widely performed by theater groups in various places and was well received by audiences. Five years later, his second work, the four-act tragedy "Old Grievances, New Sorrows," was published as a single edition in Shanghai. The content, technique, dialogue, characterization, structure, and plot of this play are all better than "Anti-Spy." The theme is also timely, depicting old lovers before the Anti-Japanese War who were separated during the eight years of war. When they reunited after victory, the situation was no longer the same, and they could only feel increased sorrow and hatred. After reading it, I had many thoughts, deep impressions, and was very moved. Therefore, I would like to introduce it to readers!

Film Introduction

### Top Ten Films of 1945

— Ya Qing

The American daily film newspaper has a grand election every year. It hires hundreds of designated representatives and film critics from various newspapers and magazines to jointly and solemnly vote to select the most perfect top ten films to encourage and reward the directors, screenwriters, actors, and staff of these films.

Last year, 1945, was the 24th year of the election, and its history can be said to be very long. In the past five years, due to the war, the blockbuster films that were listed as champions could not be announced to fans as scheduled. Here, I would also like to report the film titles to you readers: 1940 "Rebecca", 1941 "Gone With the Wind", 1942 "Mrs. Miniver", 1943 "Random Harvest", 1944 "Going My Way". The first three films have been shown in Shanghai one after another, and the latter two have not yet been shown.

As for the top ten films of 1945, let me introduce them to the readers one by one as follows:

(1) "Wilson"—A color biographical film produced by 20th Century Fox, which was recently shown in Shanghai. Completed on August 2, 1944.

(2) "A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"—Produced by 20th Century Fox.

(3) "The Keys of the Kingdom"—Produced by 20th Century Fox. It will be shown at the Majestic Theater in this city.

(4) "The Valley of Decision"—Produced by MGM, a literary film starring Greer Garson.

(5) "A Song to Remember"—A color musical biographical film produced by Columbia, starring Paul Muni, Merle Oberon, and Cornel Wilde.

(6) "Laura"—Produced by 20th Century Fox, starring Gene Tierney.

(7) "The Story of G.I. Joe"—A war film produced by United Artists.

(8) "The Corn Is Green"—Produced by Warner Bros., a literary film starring Bette Davis.

(9) "National Velvet"—A color horse film produced by MGM, starring Mickey Rooney.

(10) "Anchors Aweigh"—A color musical film produced by MGM, performed by the original cast of "Thousands Cheer".

Because the films they select are based on films officially released in American theaters from November 1 of the previous year to October 31 of the following year, "The Bells of St. Mary's" and "The Lost Weekend" were not included, while "Wilson" was included in the 1945 film list for this reason.

Film City News

### "The Garden of Eden"

— Hua

"The Garden of Eden" is a new film that has recently caused a sensation in Film City, but it may face difficulties in passing censorship.

This film and "The Bells of St. Mary's," which was recently shown at the Grand Shanghai, are from the same producer—Leo McCarey. According to his recent remarks: "This film cannot be made according to the original story of the Bible, although the Bible has several passages describing:" We know that Adam and Eve never thought of wearing clothes until after Eve stole the fruit of knowledge," but the censorship office said that filming is not allowed without clothes."

"The actors also expressed the same: The film was originally intended to have Ingrid Bergman and James Stewart play the two ancestors of mankind, but Stewart refused to accept the offer because he had tumors on his scalp and skin and could not film this kind of film."

"The company considered using leopard skin to cover the waist, but Adam never killed any wild beasts in the Garden of Eden. Someone suggested using fig leaves to make coverings because there are such trees in paradise, but they are still unwilling to try this."

"Fig leaves are continuous and can be loosely separated after braiding, which is very suitable for this purpose, but how can this form allow Miss Bergman to work?"

Mr. McCarey is a giant of religious films. He has now built the Garden of Eden on 300 acres and raised hundreds of wild animals. Historical experts are also studying and designing solutions to clothing problems.

### The Movie King: MGM

— Xin Ming

With a history of just over twenty years, in terms of reputation, dedication to production, and talent scouting in Hollywood, MGM has always been a pioneer and leader, the "trust" of the entire Hollywood. However, a large part of its success is due to its manager, Louis B. Mayer. His skillfulness in managing affairs, competence in doing things, and remarkable achievements have earned him the title of "Movie Manager of the Year" by the American "Fortune" magazine last year. Congratulations on his success.

At the same time, you only need to see MGM's neat "cast list" for 1945—they were all promoted by Mayer. MGM currently has more than 20 leading male and female stars, whose names are as follows: Van Johnson, Myrna Loy, Robert Taylor, Spencer Tracy, Clark Gable, Gene Kelly, Walter Pidgeon, Ward Bond, William Powell, Robert Montgomery. Greer Garson, Judy Garland, Katharine Grayson, Margaret O'Brien, Hepburn, Hedy Lamarr. Among the top ten highest-grossing stars of 1945, MGM stars accounted for five. Every movie fan must be amazed and undeniably acknowledge that MGM truly deserves to be the king of Hollywood and even the king of the global film industry.

This year, Louis B. Mayer has even more passionate hopes. He said, "We are like racehorses. In 1942, we were the top stable in America in 1945, so this year we still have to find good horses to fill the ranks and strive for first place." This shows how humble and not arrogant he is, which is why he can attract so many stars.

Finally, let me introduce some of MGM's best films of 1945 for movie fans to choose from, so as not to miss the masterpieces. First, "The Valley of Decision," a literary film starring Greer Garson. Second, "Anchors Aweigh," a Technicolor musical extravaganza performed by the original cast to great acclaim. Third, "National Velvet," a Technicolor horse racing film starring Myrna Loy. Fourth, "Meet Me in St. Louis," a Technicolor musical starring Judy Garland and Margaret O'Brien.

### Short-Lived Song and Dance Actresses

— Ya Feng

The careers of movie stars are usually limited by age, especially song and dance girls on the screen. Their "career life expectancy" is only three to five years.

Jack Cole, the dance director of Columbia Pictures, his lover is a girl in a song and dance troupe. She left there after the age of twenty-one.

Cole said: "Nine out of ten song and dance actresses on the screen are between the ages of eighteen and twenty-one. It is almost certain that no one in Hollywood is over twenty-five. This sentence is of course not applicable to special dancers, then she can dance even after thirty or even forty years old, like artistic programs perform."

Cole believes that the fatal wound of the short career life of song and dance girls is for the audience to welcome their "novelty" and charmingness", and this "novelty" and charmingness often disappears quickly after a strict rehearsal schedule.

"Since the advent of color films, the need for young girls has been greater." He said. To clarify this statement, Cole mentioned that in the musical "The Story of Jolson" (based on the life of Jolson), the female stars he accommodated were almost all under the age of twenty.

"Like this kind of color film, because there are many individual close-up shots of female stars, the average age is further reduced," the dance director said.

Many girls are suitable for dancing at the age of fifteen to seventeen, but before the age of eighteen, they still have to go to school, because the company's stars or special awards help them enter school.

"But don't feel sorry for their short careers," Cole said with a warning tone; "because they themselves don't feel sorry. In fact, they are the happiest in the film. Almost none of them need a career, what they want is a husband, and it seems that they have all found ideal people."——Originally published in the Shanghai Free West News on April 2nd

### Film Industry News

Zong You, the author of the famous play "The Jade Kirin", after changing his career to writing and directing, still participates in acting from time to time, playing "old male roles". Now, in order to seek new development, he has returned to Nanjing to organize a new drama troupe, planning to stage a play in Nanjing first.

Sun Jianbai, a famous actor who became famous for playing "old male roles", has now officially left "China Film Studio" and joined the "Drama Academy Alumni Troupe". He will arrive in Beijing soon and will assist Mr. Wang Ruilin in rehearsing three or four plays in preparation for a tour of Shanghai, Hangzhou, Pingjin and other areas.

The National Academy of Drama has been restored and decided to move back to Nanjing. From mid-June, students who pay their own expenses can go east first. The entire school will move to Nanjing in mid-September, and it is expected to resume classes in Beijing before the end of the year.

### Family Entertainment

— Lei Yun

Entertainment is innate and a right in human life. However, Chinese people have always not paid attention to this. In their spare time, they have no normal entertainment except playing cards and turning on the radio. This is actually a very serious problem in the family that cannot be ignored.

Entertainment should be proper, with not hindering it as the first priority, and should have the qualities of increasing knowledge, taking care of health, and being interesting.

For babies or children of two or three years old, the choice of toys should be based on nobility and cleanliness. Such as beautiful dolls, colorful pictures, and sounding musical instruments, can form his meaningful feelings. Avoid using puppets, Guanyin, Maitreya Buddha, etc. to induce superstitious impressions.

As for children aged six or seven to twelve or thirteen, playing with balls, kicking shuttlecocks, and jumping rope at home are also promoting normal exercise. Parents should save some money to purchase some children's reading materials for them to read after class and after meals. A beautiful and noble family should avoid children reading boring comic books, or letting children stand by the table and watch card games, or playing marbles and spinning sugar with other children, as well as all similar gambling games.

For young people over the age of fourteen or fifteen, they should develop their proper hobbies, such as collecting stamps, which can allow them to explore the customs and cultures of various countries and regions, as well as historical patterns, at the post office. Or, for those who like music, teach them to practice singing, learn musical notation, or simple instruments such as harmonicas and accordions. For those who love art, give them some practice painting models and drawing tools to engage in imitation and exploration. If children want to participate in outdoor sports, such as football, basketball, rowing, swimming, etc., parents should not prohibit them.

It seems that adults have no entertainment at home! No, people who like to read can subscribe to some beneficial books and newspapers, so that they can both relax and seek knowledge, so that their thoughts can keep up with the times and not become outdated and stubborn. Some people like to practice calligraphy, some people like to write books, and some people like to carve seals. Although they do not hope to become famous, the meaning of entertainment lies in it! Growing flowers and raising birds are also suitable entertainment, just do not spend two hours every morning looking at flowers, and raise seven or eight birds at home. Playing with things becomes a loss of ambition and loses the meaning of entertainment.

Don't girls and wives have no entertainment! No, women specialize in needlework and cooking. When doing needlework, they can strive for exquisiteness and originality; or when cooking, pay attention to deliciousness and make famous dishes. This can be said to be integrating entertainment into work. For the arrangement of the home and the arrangement of utensils, a woman with an artistic concept will also feel interested when she starts working.

Playing mahjong is one of the most undesirable forms of entertainment for women in Shanghai. If listening to the radio, they should also choose noble music, beneficial lectures, and educational broadcasts that inspire knowledge. If you only listen to low-level, nonsensical, and superstitious ghost stories, then the thoughts of the listeners will naturally become humble and dirty, which is truly unhelpful and harmful.
