### Government Organization Reaches Tense Agreement, Decides to Establish Political Committee in Executive Yuan, Three Agreements Reached on Military Reorganization Principles

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 23rd] The Political Consultative Conference's subcommittees have been negotiating for days. Although partial agreements are reached daily, they are still far from resolving all issues. Negotiations continue today, and the work of the comprehensive subcommittee has begun to break the deadlock and avoid further delays to the conference. The achievements of each group on the 22nd are recorded as follows: (1) Government Organization Group: The fifth meeting was held at 10:00 AM on the 22nd. The Communist Party insisted again that the National Government Committee should be the highest authority and demanded the reorganization of fourteen important ministries. They forced the government to make promises, almost making negotiations impossible. The Youth Party then proposed a compromise to first discuss the organization of the Executive Yuan, deciding to establish a political committee within the Executive Yuan to allow participation from all parties. The political committee would consist of seventeen to nineteen members who could also serve as heads of ministries, but with equal powers. The distribution of their quotas is under negotiation. The Communist Party advocated for the reorganization of local institutions with the participation of all parties, but this was not approved. (3) Military Group: The meeting was held on the morning of the 22nd, and negotiations proceeded smoothly. Three major agreements were reached on the principles of military reorganization: A: Separation of military and party: All parties are prohibited from engaging in open or secret activities in the military. Active-duty soldiers must leave the party, military education must be independent, and no political party may use the military as a tool for political struggle. B: Separation of military and civilian affairs: Active-duty soldiers may not hold administrative positions, and a military district system will be implemented, with divisions different from administrative regions. Strict prohibition of military interference in politics. C: Reorganization of the army: The three-person group will implement the planned reorganization. Regarding the reorganization of the Communist Party's army, the central government indicated that the two-month deadline still needs consideration. The National Army will complete the reorganization of the Ministry of Military Affairs into ninety divisions within six months. By the 36th year of the Republic, the national army will be mixed and reorganized into sixty or fifty divisions. D: An assessment committee for reorganization plans will be established within the Military Affairs Committee, and all parties can send representatives to participate. (3) Program Group: The meeting was held at 3:30 PM on the 22nd. Because the parties were far apart, only the foreign affairs and overseas Chinese affairs were discussed. The result was a decision that China's foreign policy should be equal and friendly with the United States, the Soviet Union, and Britain, implementing the Atlantic Charter to safeguard world peace and promptly sign new commercial treaties with various countries to protect the interests of overseas Chinese. (4) Constitution Drafting Group: When the meeting was held on the afternoon of the 22nd, the atmosphere was extremely harmonious. Because all parties unanimously agreed with the spirit of the Five-Power Constitution and were able to look at things from an objective standpoint, many agreements were reached. A: National voters should exercise the four powers in the Second National Congress. B: Before the implementation of universal suffrage, the president will be elected by electoral organs composed of county, provincial, and central public opinion institutions. C: The appointment and removal of the president will follow the same method. D: The exercise of the rights of initiative and referendum will be clarified in separate laws. E: The Legislative Yuan is the highest legislative body in the country, equivalent to the parliament of other countries, and its members are directly elected by voters. F: The Control Yuan is the highest supervisory body in the country, composed of elections by provincial-level institutions and the parliaments of ethnic autonomous regions, exercising the powers of consent and impeachment. G: The two judicial Yuans are the highest courts in the country, not concurrently handling judicial administration, and composed of several grand justices nominated by the president and approved by the Control Yuan. H: The Examination Yuan is a committee system. All members should be independent of party affiliation, and their duties focus on the examination of civil servants and professionals. I: The administration is responsible to the Legislative Yuan, but it does not include motions of no confidence. Also, the military second group will continue to meet this morning, and the policy program group will continue to meet this afternoon.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 23rd] The Comprehensive Subcommittee of the Political Consultative Conference was established today, holding its first meeting at 4:00 PM. It conducted a thorough discussion of various issues and reached some agreements. The meeting is scheduled to continue on the 24th. The committee members are as follows: Wang Shijie, Wu Tiecheng, Chen Qitian, Wang Yunwu, Fu Sinian, Zhang Bojun, Zhang Dongsun, Zhou Enlai, Dong Biwu, convener Sun Ke.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 23rd] A press conference for foreign reporters was held at 3:00 PM, hosted by Minister Wu Guozhen, Vice Minister Liu Chi, and Councilor Zhang Pingpan, who answered questions, stating that the date of the Political Consultative Conference's general assembly will depend on the progress of each subcommittee. The military three-person group has met once in the past. Now that General Marshall has agreed to serve as an advisor, consultations will continue.

### Large-Scale Conflicts Gradually Decreasing, Communist Party Transfers Staff Officers of Military Regions to Peiping to Receive Orders and Methods from the Executive Headquarters

[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 22nd] Although the sound of gunfire can still be faintly heard throughout the country, the work of the mediation department and the ceasefire order are not completely ineffective. Government and Communist Party personnel of the Executive Headquarters unanimously acknowledged the following facts today: (1) Large-scale frontal conflicts in various places have gradually decreased. The flames of war in Jining and Datong have been extinguished, and the Nationalists and Communists in Taian have even established an association. (2) Incidents of traffic disruption have basically decreased compared to before. However, because a few disruptions occurred after the ceasefire order took effect, they have received special attention from the public. However, amidst this optimistic atmosphere, another noteworthy piece of news is that the Communist Party's army is frequently moving and gradually concentrating along the railway lines. Its intention may be to maintain its control over the railway after traffic is restored. Regarding the restoration of traffic, Communist Party personnel here also showed their eagerness. Miss Gong Peng, the spokesperson for their news group, told a Peiping reporter that the Communist Party also hopes that traffic will be restored as soon as possible. The Communist Party has suffered deeply from traffic difficulties for several years. In the past, the Communist Party personnel in Yan'an and Chongqing felt infinitely isolated, let alone the communication between Yan'an and various war zones. Therefore, when Zhou Enlai negotiated with government representatives on the Chifeng issue, he was at a loss and unable to answer questions from foreign reporters about the Communist Party's army situation near Chifeng. The failure to quickly and universally implement this ceasefire was also due to traffic difficulties, which prevented the orders from arriving on schedule.

[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 22nd] In the past week, eight groups of peace angels have descended from the sky to the areas with the most intense gunfire throughout the country. The place names are Jining, Chifeng, Datong, Zhangjiakou, Jinan, and Xuzhou. Six groups departed from Chongqing, and another group is a reserve group, ready to be sent to areas where major conflicts occur temporarily. The mediation work of each group is proceeding smoothly. According to the third public notice issued by the Executive Headquarters today, the work in Jinan is nearing success, Jining and Datong have ceased fire, and the situation in Chifeng will also be announced soon. The supply of each peace group is entirely undertaken by the Executive Headquarters. In recent days, airplanes have been delivering equipment, supplies, and all necessary tools to these peace angels every day, and foreign reporters are accompanying them to observe. Local reporters here are also planning to organize a reporter group to visit important areas where peace has been restored.

[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 22nd] The most optimistic people in the Executive Headquarters predict that before New Year's Eve, the sound of gunfire all over North China can be replaced by the sound of firecrackers. It is reported that the Communist Party plans to transfer staff officers from its thirteen military regions to Peiping to receive orders and methods from the Executive Headquarters to stop conflicts, and then return to their respective military region headquarters to command their subordinates to earnestly comply. As of now, the deputy chief of staff and his entourage from the Ji-Re-Liao and Ji-Cha-Jin military regions have arrived in Peiping. The method of stopping conflicts announced in the second public notice issued by the Executive Headquarters yesterday is generally considered to be quite practical because it not only specifies the steps to stop conflicts in detail but also clearly indicates its purpose. The judgment of right and wrong and various adjustments will be carried out in the later stages of stopping conflicts and withdrawal. The war seems to be still ongoing in the Gubeikou area not far from Peiping. It is said that the Communist army in that area is very well-equipped, the soldiers are all wearing woolen uniforms, and the guns are also sharp, probably taken from the Japanese. One regimental commander of the National Army was killed in action there. After the issuance of the second order of the Executive Headquarters, the conflict there is also expected to be completely stopped in accordance with the order. The situation in Suiyuan is still quite tense. General Fu Zuoyi has sent Jia Wenshu, the chief of staff of the 35th Army, to Peiping to report and coordinate. The three parties in the Executive Headquarters, amidst the constant gunfire from various places, are still moving towards the goal of a ceasefire in a harmonious atmosphere. As the office of the Executive Headquarters, the gate of Xiehe Hospital has been guarded by one soldier each from the government and the Communist Party since yesterday. The first to take turns yesterday were Sergeant Lu Qingfu of the 20th Regiment of the Military Police and Hu Guiping, the instructor of a certain guard platoon of the Communist Party. When reporters asked them what they thought about standing guard together, they both smiled and replied: "We have already talked, and there is absolutely no problem between us."

### Yunnan Highway Branch Takes Over Chinese-Indian Pipeline, Domestic Section

[Our Newspaper, Kunming, 23rd] The issue of the Chinese-Indian pipeline's external placement has now been resolved. The domestic section, consisting of a thousand kilometers of pipeline and oil pools in various places, has been taken over by the Yunnan Branch of the Highway Administration. The personnel handling the handover and acceptance of the bureau and the pipeline engineering office are scheduled to conduct on-site inspections and acceptance along the pipeline line at the beginning of next month. As for the current approximately 200 employees of the Pipeline Engineering Office, some will be transferred to work in the Beijing-Shanghai-Tianjin area, and some will be laid off.

### Madame Chiang Bestows Medals on Soviet Soldiers in Changchun Yesterday, Broadcasts Comfort to the Masses in the Northeast Today

[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 22nd] Madame Chiang arrived here at noon on the 22nd, and senior Chinese and Soviet officials went to the airport to greet her. On our side were Zhang Jia'ao, Chiang Ching-kuo, Dong Yanping, Zhao Junmai, Jin Enxin, etc., and representatives of women from various places. On the Soviet side were General Leonov, the representative of Marshal Malinowski, the commander of the military region, and the regional commander, etc. We also had a guard of honor and a military band. The Soviet representative expressed to Madame Chiang that Marshal Malinowski was returning to his country for elections and did not know the exact date of Madame Chiang's arrival, and was rushing back here. Madame Chiang came here on behalf of Chairman Chiang to comfort the Allied forces and bestow medals and appease the people. Rest on the afternoon of the 22nd, the central personnel here held a dinner for Madame Chiang on the 23rd, and the medal awarding ceremony for the Allied soldiers was held on the same day. Marshal Malinowski hosted a banquet on the 24th. It is reported that the food prepared by the Soviet side was airlifted here from the Soviet Union. Madame Chiang will stay here for several days and will meet with people from all walks of life and women representatives.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 22nd] After Madame Chiang landed in Changchun, General Leonov delivered a welcome speech on behalf of Marshal Malinowski, which read in substance: I only represent the Soviet Red Army stationed in the Northeast and Marshal Malinowski to express my warm greetings to Madame and her entourage. We are extremely fortunate to meet the outstanding social activist of the great Chinese people. Whether in the past, present, or future, we are willing to cooperate with the Chinese people who are fighting for their own liberation and who are friendly with the Soviet Union. I believe that Madame's presence here can also prove that the Soviet Red Army and the entire Soviet Union have always been good friends of the Chinese people and are willing to work side by side with the Chinese people to consolidate the victory over Japan and guarantee peace in East Asia. I wish Madame a successful mission here, long live the great people of China and the Soviet Union, long live Chairman Chiang, long live Marshal Stalin.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 22nd] Madame Chiang is scheduled to broadcast at 1:20 PM on the 24th at the Changchun Central Bank to comfort the people of the Northeast. The Changchun Radio Station call sign is "XGOC" and its wavelength is [560] kHz.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 22nd] When Madame Chiang entered the streets of Changchun from the airport, she was surrounded by welcoming citizens, and the cheers rose one after another like a raging tide. Madame, together with Chiang Ching-kuo, etc., Miss Kong Lingwei rode in the same car. When they were surrounded by the welcoming crowd, Madame got out of the car and walked on the snow, nodding and smiling frequently to show her gratitude to the crowd. Madame is visiting the Northeast for the first time. In addition to comforting the Soviet army, she is also comforting the people of the Northeast. A month ago, news of Madame's visit had been heard here. Women's circles in Harbin, Shenyang, and other places had already sent representatives to wait here at the beginning of the month. Now that they have seen Madame's demeanor in person, many in the cheering crowd shed tears along with their voices. Such touching scenes are the only ones the reporter has seen since arriving in Changchun.

### Repair and Traffic Conditions of Highways in Henan and Anhui Provinces

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] The National Highway Conference has been held for four days. According to the reports of representatives from various provinces, Henan and Anhui provinces are the most impoverished and the hardest hit. According to Li Wuqiao, Director of the Henan Provincial Highway Bureau, who attended the meeting, the greatest difficulties in repairing the highways in Henan Province are the shortage of funds and the lack of manpower. In terms of sections, western Henan is easier, eastern Henan is more difficult, and northern and southern Henan are even more arduous. At present, after repairs, driving from Didongzhen to Luoyang and Zhengzhou in western Henan is safer than before. The Shaanxi-Henan Joint Transportation Office has daily buses traveling between Luo and Zhengzhou, and there are no security problems along the way. Due to financial difficulties, the Henan Provincial Highway Bureau only has 150 employees. After the Japanese surrendered, the bureau received dozens of military vehicles, but they are still shelved due to lack of money for repairs. According to Ma Yimin, Director of the Anhui Provincial Highway Bureau, told our reporter that only more than a dozen counties in eastern Anhui and a few counties north of the Wo River are still in the hands of the Communist army. Approximately 2,662 kilometers of highways have been repaired in Anhui Province, and they are barely passable now. However, the road surface and bridges are far from standard. Although the Provincial Highway Bureau has several punts, a total of 24, only 15 are actually usable.

### Increase Gasoline Tax to Allocate Road Maintenance Fees

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] Road maintenance fees for national highways will be allocated from the increased gasoline tax in the future. This is a major resolution passed at today's Highway Conference and will be implemented once approved by the government. It was also decided that a National Highway Exhibition will be held in Peiping on August 1,000th of this year.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] The Highway Conference continued yesterday morning and afternoon. More than 80 proposals in the engineering category of the conference were all discussed and completed, including the approval of the plan to divide various highway improvement and road maintenance projects, and how to deal with pre-war private highways damaged by the war.

### Hefei to be Established as a City, Preparatory Office to be Established Immediately

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] Hefei News: The relocation of the Anhui Provincial Government from Lihuang to Hefei has become a reality, and the provincial government is moving. Hefei will be established as a city, and the municipal preparatory office will be established immediately, but the candidate for director has not yet been determined. There is a lack of housing in Hefei, and the construction cost of each department of the provincial government is estimated to be more than 30 million yuan.

### Nationalist Army Transported North by Sea from South China, Advance Troops Arrive at Goubangzi, Chairmen of Hejiang and Heilongjiang Provinces Depart to Take Over

[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 23rd] The Nationalist army that has entered Shenyang is still stationed in the historically significant Beida Camp and has not yet implemented the takeover. Xing Ying Commissioner Xiong Shihui is also temporarily staying in Jinzhou. The road between Peiping and Goubangzi can now be opened to traffic, and the roads between Ping, Chang, and Ha are expected to be opened soon. Therefore, most of the high-ranking officials of the Northeast provinces and cities who remained in Peiping will travel by train. More than 20 people from Xing'an Province will depart by train on the 23rd.

[Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 22nd] After our army took over Xinmin, there are still more than 20 Soviet troops stationed there, and there are still 50 in Zhangwu. On the 17th, the number of Soviet troops in Xinmin increased by more than 300, and the number in Zhangwu increased by 150. At present, we and the Soviet side can cooperate in maintaining local security. According to the person in charge of the Soviet army, in order to promote friendship between the two countries, they are willing to assist the National Army in clearing the surrounding bandits to ensure local peace. Based on the above situation, it is sufficient to show that the Chinese and Soviet troops are living together in the same city, and their relationship is extremely harmonious. Our troops transported by sea from South China to Qinhuangdao have arrived in the area one after another, and they have been dispatched to designated locations. The advance troops arrived at Goubangzi and nearby areas on the 22nd.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 23rd] Wu Hantao, Chairman of Hejiang Province, and Han Junjie, Chairman of Heilongjiang Province, together with the takeover personnel and security team of the two provinces, left for Harbin by special train at 9:00 AM this morning and will go to Jiamusi and Bei'an to take over the provincial administration of the two provinces.

### National Government Renovation Project Underway, Chairman's Office Simple and Unadorned

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] According to Shen Mianhou, Secretary of the National Government, told reporters that the severe desolation of Nanjing City will not delay the government's return to the capital. The arduous and trivial National Government renovation project will take about a month. The interior layout of the National Government will be represented by the four words "solemn and clean." Today, reporters from this newspaper were escorted by two soldiers from the National Government Guard to view the entire building. In a guest room, they saw several simple tables and chairs and three or four simple cloth-covered sofas that will be used in the Chairman's office in the future. This simple and unadorned equipment in the Chairman's office is far inferior to the enjoyment of some officials in Shanghai today. However, it is predicted that the head of state, who works hard day and night, will never be treated lightly because of his simplicity. The National Government office, which had been occupied by the traitor Liang Hongzhi for many years, was destroyed in its third and fourth years. Standing water was still seen when it was taken over, and weeds were growing on the roof. What is most regrettable is that small trees actually grew on the railings. Liang Hongzhi probably predicted that his treacherous political life would be very short, and everything was perfunctory. On the wall of the West Garden of the National Government, there is a "West Garden Elegant Gathering" inscribed by Jiang Kanghu, whose handwriting is as filthy as the man. Liang Hongzhi's "Record of the Reconstruction of the West Garden" was inscribed, but it is thought to have been removed by the gardener with a knife.

The official explanation is that the Committee on Political Security was unable to prepare a report on atomic energy for submission to the General Assembly this afternoon, hence the cancellation of the meeting.

[United Press London, 23rd] United Nations agencies today temporarily set aside the issues of Iran, Greece, and East India, and proceeded to deal with basic issues, especially the organization of an atomic energy management committee to ensure world security. A special proposal on this matter has been submitted to the United Nations General Assembly for discussion. Its content advocates first establishing a committee to study various issues of atomic energy management, and then submit concrete recommendations to the Security Council. US Secretary of State Byrnes announced today that after the formation of this British committee, he must return to Washington. At the same time, United Nations agency officials believe that cases such as Iran, Greece, and East India are only temporary side issues and do not believe that they are enough to cause a crisis. According to General Assembly President Spaak, there is no need to be either pessimistic or optimistic about the future. We must identify our goals and not repeat the mistakes of the League of Nations, reversing priorities and ignoring fundamental and important issues.

### United Nations Committees Hold Separate Meetings

[Reuters London, 23rd] The six committees of the United Nations and the Economic and Social Council are all scheduled to meet today.

[United Press London, 22nd] The United Nations Economic and Social Council has established a Narcotics Management Committee. According to the chief representative of the committee, the first step of the committee will be to collect statistics on the production, sale, and consumption of drugs around the world, and will stipulate the allowable consumption limits for each country. China is one of the main producing countries. Before the war, opium addicts accounted for 3% to 10% of the total population of that country.

[Reuters London, 23rd] At a meeting of the United Nations Economic and Financial Committee yesterday, the United Kingdom moved that countries that signed the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) agreement should continue to contribute 1% of their national treasury income to subsidize the expenses of the agency. Peace-loving countries that have not signed the agreement may also be invited to join. The Soviet representative put forward some amendments, and the Greek representative said that this first experiment in international cooperation had achieved amazing success. The Argentine representative said that he believed that participants in the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration should not be limited to United Nations member states. For example, Sweden and Switzerland, although neutral countries during the war, their moral authority has been widely heard.

[Reuters London, 23rd] The United Nations Legal Committee held a meeting yesterday afternoon and passed the proposal of Lebanese representative Couri by a vote of 22 to 21, resolving that there is no need to nominate candidates when electing officials of United Nations agencies in the future. The secret ballot system is used, the same as the procedure for the election of General Assembly President Spaak. If this proposal is passed by the General Assembly, the "nomination" of candidates will be decided outside the meeting.

### Syrian Representative Accuses France of Colonial Policy

[United Press London, 22nd] Syrian representative Zini Ting delivered a speech in the United Nations Trusteeship Committee today, attacking France for granting the status of autonomous regions to the mandated territories of Togo and Cameroon, and denouncing it as a disguised annexation action. It is said that France seems hesitant and unwilling to immediately hand over its mandated territories to the United Nations for management. If this action is accepted, the purpose of the United Nations will be undermined. France is now putting forward its unilateral annexation action and demanding that various countries recognize it. The Syrian delegation once refused, and its reasoning is clear. The Syrian government's position is the same as that of New Zealand, advocating that all countries with mandates should fully comply with the United Nations trusteeship plan. The League of Nations sometimes puts illegal actions under the cloak of legality, and this should not happen in the United Nations today. British representative Jones declared that there are still some suspicions between some countries regarding the United Nations' management of mandated territories. The Trusteeship Committee should immediately ask the mandated countries whether they are prepared to hand over their mandated territories to United Nations agencies.

### Development of Atomic Energy Can Accelerate Cancer Research and Help Women with Infertility

[United Press Washington, 22nd] An official from the US Public Health Service said today that the development of atomic bombs during the war "can accelerate cancer research," but there is no hope of treating cancer. Dr. Spencer, director of the National Cancer Institute of the Public Health Service, believes that the fission products of atoms will become "painful new research tools." He continued: "At present, no one can determine whether this new development in atoms can initiate a new revolutionary method in the treatment of cancer." Dr. Spencer warned: "We must not be overly optimistic, because it is still difficult to obtain definitive evidence that the fission of atoms can help treat cancer. The mortality rate of cancer patients in the United States is about one in eight. Currently, surgical treatment and X-ray treatment are still the methods used by doctors. Only the mortality rate of heart disease exceeds the mortality rate of cancer. The cancer of atomic fission products can develop into a considerable number of radioelement molecules, which are extremely helpful for biological exploration and cancer research.

[French News Agency Tokyo, 22nd] It is said that atomic bombs still have surprising physiological effects on humans. Tokyo newspapers reported that gynecologists in Hiroshima reported that about ten women who were originally infertile now have hope of having children, and middle-aged women also have signs of regaining their youth. Hens that did not lay eggs in June have also resumed laying eggs.

### Seeking to Resolve the Situation in East India, British Envoy Will Act as Mediator; Independent Government Hopes British Troops Can Withdraw Soon

[United Press Washington, 23rd] According to reliable sources here: Dutch people sincerely welcome the appointment of Sir Kerr, the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, as the special mediator in Indonesia. It is heard that British Foreign Secretary Bevin told Dutch diplomats in London: "Kerr is the most suitable candidate." Informed sources believe that Kerr will arrive in the Dutch East Indies after Deputy Governor-General Van Mook returns to office.

[United Press Batavia, 22nd] Prime Minister Skarir of the East India Independent Government issued a declaration today: Expressing gratitude to all countries in the world for their concern about the situation in Java. It is said that if the Soviet Union does not object, it is willing to have British troops stay in Java until the Japanese troops are completely withdrawn. If the British troops withdraw immediately, the Japanese troops may refuse to surrender their weapons or even resist. Skarir hopes that the United Kingdom will fully trust the East India Independent Government, and that British troops can withdraw from Java after the Allied mission is completed. The East India Independent Government has not appealed to the United Nations. This move will be reserved until all other solutions have proven ineffective. If any country wants to raise the issue of the stationing of British troops, the Soviet Union would be the most appropriate, because it has the least direct interest in East India among the major powers and can raise this issue from a moral standpoint.

[United Press Batavia, 23rd] A British military patrol today used heavy artillery and tanks to clear out the East India Independent Army near Surabaya. Four British soldiers were injured. Suburbs of Batavia were searched, and a total of 350 East Indians were detained for questioning.

### General Shang Zhen and Others Depart Chongqing for England to Attend Chiefs of Staff Conference

[Central News Agency Chongqing, 23rd] The head of our delegation to London to participate in the United Nations Chiefs of Staff Conference, Shang Zhen, along with Sun Liren, Zhao Guisen, Gong Zuoren, Zhou Yingtong, Huang Panyang, Secretary Chen Hongzhen, Zhang Baoling, and others, left Chongqing on the morning of the 23rd. Gui, a member of the delegation, Yongqing will transfer to London from Germany.

### Zheng Tianxi Nominated as Candidate for International Court of Justice

[Central News Agency Geneva, 22nd Special Dispatch] Groups from several countries have nominated Dr. Zheng Tianxi, the Chinese judge of the Geneva International Court, as a candidate for judge of the new International Court of Justice. According to the decision of the Yijinshan Conference, the election is conducted by the United Nations General Assembly. Zheng Tianxi told reporters that he recently expressed to the United Nations Logistics Committee his willingness to waive his candidacy to help other Chinese candidates get elected. He is willing to use his experience to contribute to the cause of national construction. Zheng plans to return to China in July. If the new International Court of Justice has not yet been established in March, the current judges of the International Court of Justice will submit their resignations to the United Nations General Assembly, which is scheduled to be held in Geneva.

[United Press London, 23rd] The Republic of the Philippines today nominated four judges for the International Court of Justice, including Dr. Xu Mo, Chinese Ambassador to Turkey, Judge Horton of the Harvard Law School in the United States, former Philippine Commissioner to the United States Tergado, and Judge Tchaye of the Philippine Supreme Court.

### On the Strategic Islands of the Pacific, Acheson Issues Statement: No Change in Control Without US Consent

[Reuters Washington, 23rd] US Undersecretary of State Acheson said yesterday: According to the San Francisco Charter, the control of the former Japanese islands in the Pacific region that are of strategic importance may not be changed without US consent. President Truman recently declared that he will apply to the United Nations agencies to establish a separate trusteeship system in each of these island towns. This application should be made to the Security Council. Even if one of the five major powers uses its veto power to oppose this trusteeship system, the islands will inevitably maintain the status quo and remain occupied by the US military. If the Security Council approves the US application, the US will be free to deploy defenses on these islands. Applications for trusteeship in strategically important areas should be made to the Security Council, and applications for other lands should be made to the Trusteeship Council. After passing, it will be submitted to the General Assembly for discussion. When reporters raised the question that if the Security Council fails to pass it due to the use of veto power, will the United States continue to occupy and defend the islands regardless of the will of the United Nations agencies. Acheson declined to comment on this, only saying that this question should be answered by higher-level people. Acheson continued that before applying for trusteeship, negotiations should be conducted through normal diplomatic channels with countries directly related to the military strategic areas. There are also islands in the Pacific region that were formerly mandated to be governed by British dominions and liberated by the US military during the war. This issue should be discussed directly between the United States and the dominions, and also discussed within the Security Council. Before applying for trusteeship, there is no need to hold a peace conference to transfer the former Japanese islands to the United States. This matter can be decided by normal diplomatic negotiations or other methods.

[United Press Washington, 22nd] US Undersecretary of State Acheson told reporters today that the three powers established an agreement at the Yalta Conference, allowing the Soviet Union to occupy the Kuril Islands during the war, but the Soviet occupation was temporary and only for occupation purposes. Acheson said that although the agreement did not stipulate that the Kuril Islands would eventually be transferred to Soviet control, the result would inevitably be so. He said that there were no other secret agreements at the Yalta Conference regarding the disposition of pre-war Japanese territories. If the United States decides to retain the conquered territories for strategic reasons, such as Okinawa, Iwo Jima, or Saipan, it must submit them to the Council of the United Nations agencies for decision. Acheson pointed out: If this request is rejected, the United States still has the right to militarily occupy these islands.

### Puppet Envoy Wang De Yin Still in Spain

[United Press, Madrid, 22nd] Japanese diplomatic personnel are currently en route from Spain to Manila, but Wang De Yin, the puppet Chinese government's ambassador to Spain, is still permitted to reside in Spain. Wang, who is fifty years old, stated today that he accepted this position in 1942 because his father resided in the Japanese-occupied areas of China. If he had refused, he feared the Japanese would take retaliatory measures. Personnel at the Chinese Embassy in England told the United Press today that Chongqing wants Wang to be tried as a traitor, and that since the Chinese government has no representative stationed in Spain, the minister to Portugal will have to handle the extradition.

### US, UK, and India to Send Personnel to Investigate Japanese Textile Industry

[Reuters, London, 23rd] The international textile delegation organized by the US State Department and the War Department departed for Japan on January 15th. The governments of China, Great Britain, and India have now accepted the invitation to send observers to join the delegation. Their names are as follows: Yang Xizeng (transliteration) (Ministry of Economic Affairs) for China, Winterbottom (United Textile Committee Commissioner) for Great Britain, and Ram for India. The delegation will report to Supreme Commander General MacArthur and assist him in collecting information on the Japanese textile industry.

### American Oil Experts Arrive in China

[United Press, San Francisco, 23rd] Oil experts Egerov, Scanless Moore, and Robe, at the invitation of the Chinese government, flew to the Far East from here on the night of the 21st to conduct a preliminary survey on the development of Chinese oil.

### MacArthur Arrests More Japanese War Criminals, Matsuoka Yosuke Recovers and Surrenders to Await Trial

[United Press, Tokyo, 23rd] MacArthur today ordered the arrest of another forty-eight war crimes suspects, ordering them to report to Sugamo Prison as soon as possible. The list includes three lieutenant generals: Nakano, former commander of the Japanese army in Batavia; Teshima, former commander of the Second Army; and Yoda, former commander of the Fifth Division. The list also includes many naval officers, most of whom belonged to the former garrison in Luzon.

[United Press, Tokyo, 23rd] Matsuoka Yosuke was previously ordered to be arrested by MacArthur for war crimes, but he was ill at home and allowed to be treated at home by the authorities. He has now recovered and surrendered to Sugamo Prison yesterday to await trial.

[United Press, New York, 22nd] Five British members of the committee for indicting Japanese war criminals departed from England today and arrived at LaGuardia Airport, en route to Japan. The group, led by British King's Counsel Storey-Teale, will travel to Washington tomorrow to consult with British officials and personnel from the US State Department. They are scheduled to leave the US for Tokyo on February 1st.

### US Secretary of the Army Arrives in Berlin

[United Press, Berlin, 23rd] US Secretary of the Army Patterson arrived here during his world tour and will stay for one day. He said that he sympathized with the homesickness of American soldiers, but he believed that Americans were gradually recognizing their responsibility to maintain peace in the future. The War Department hopes that in the future, all American occupation forces in Germany and Japan can be staffed by volunteers. The authorities of the four countries, Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France, are still in consultation on the issues of determining the western border of Germany and organizing the central administrative institutions for the management of Germany. In order to break the deadlock, concessions may be made to France.

### South African Indians Appeal Against Property Freeze

[Reuters, London, 23rd] The Executive Committee of the Natal Indian Congress of South Africa has decided to appeal to the United Nations to oppose the proposal to freeze property transactions between Indians and other ethnic groups in South Africa. However, this resolution has not yet been conveyed to the Indian delegation to the United Nations here. The group's leader, Mudaliar, said that he had not yet paid attention to the matter. This freezing proposal was announced by South African Prime Minister Smuts in the South African Parliament on Monday.

### France to Succeed the President, Gouin Expected to be Elected, Unanimously Supported by the Three Major Parties

[This Newspaper] According to a broadcast from London on the 23rd, the French Constituent Assembly convened a meeting today to discuss the election of a new president of France, but it adjourned without result because the three major parties (Communist Party, Socialist Party, and Catholic Party) failed to reach an agreement.

[United Press, Paris, 23rd] The speaker of the French Constituent Assembly, Socialist leader Gouin, resigned from his position as speaker today in order to run as a candidate for the interim president of France. Socialist leader Auriol has been nominated as a candidate for speaker.

[United Press, Paris, 22nd] The French political turmoil seemed to have been resolved today, with Socialist leader Gouin, the speaker of the Constituent Assembly, being nominated as the interim presidential candidate to succeed de Gaulle, and the Socialist Party also announcing its support. The Assembly held a short meeting and then adjourned until Wednesday to elect an interim president, but it may be postponed until Thursday. The Communist Party originally nominated Thorez as its presidential candidate, but withdrew it this morning and proposed Gouin as the presidential candidate to the Socialist Party. Gouin was initially unwilling to run, so the Socialist Party nominated Auriol, a minister without portfolio, but the Communist Party immediately expressed its opposition. The People's Republican Movement also supports Gouin. The Communist Party suggested that Gouin's nomination was a "partisan" action because Gouin was unanimously elected as speaker by all parties in November last year, so his election this time is almost inevitable. Gouin agreed to run only after the Assembly convened. The Assembly expects that Gouin's cabinet can be established tomorrow evening, with only a few changes to the old cabinet. According to Communist Party authorities, the party may not object to Bidault continuing as foreign minister. Bidault is the leader of the People's Republican Movement and has proposed to the Communist and Socialist parties that a meeting of the three-party committee be held tomorrow morning, which is expected to formally establish coordination. The Assembly is scheduled to meet at 2:00 pm tomorrow. If the People's Republican Movement does not object, Gouin can be elected.

[French News Agency, Paris, 22nd] The three right-leaning French parties, namely the Republican Unity Party, the Independent Republican Party, and the Peasant Party, held a joint meeting today to discuss how to coordinate the activities of the three parties in the Constituent Assembly. It is generally believed that no matter who the three major parties nominate as a candidate, the representatives of the moderates will not vote in favor. It is reported that some moderates may vote for Michel Clemenceau, the son of World War I Prime Minister Clemenceau, as a candidate. The Republican Unity Party intends to still vote for de Gaulle in order to praise General de Gaulle's service to the country in French history.

### British Malaya, Enhancing Work Efficiency to Adapt to Wartime Needs, British Government Issues White Paper

[Reuters, London, 23rd] The British government issued a white paper yesterday, announcing the plan to reorganize the Straits Settlements and the Malay Federation. It is planned to establish the colony of Singapore and the Federation of Malaya, including the nine Malay states, Penang, and Malacca. In October last year, the British government made a similar statement in Parliament, and the plan in the white paper has expanded on that statement. The white paper suggests that the Federation of Malaya and the colony of Singapore should have two independent governors and independent administrative and legislative bodies. This reorganization can enhance work efficiency to meet post-war needs and rapidly advance towards the establishment of self-government. The adjustment of the Straits Settlements can begin after the "Straits Settlements Act" comes into effect, which has now been submitted to Parliament for review. Regarding the Malay states, the new law will empower the British monarch to legislate for each state. After friendly discussions, the heads of the Malay states have agreed to grant all jurisdiction of each state to the British monarch. The rulers of the Malay states are still the traditional and spiritual rulers of the Malay people, so each state will establish an advisory committee, chaired by the head of the state, to handle various issues related to religion. Each state head is also a member of the Federal Central Advisory Committee, which is chaired by the Governor of the Federation of Malaya, to review all legislation related to Islam and may discuss other issues with the consent of the Governor. Therefore, the heads of the Malay states will not only assume responsibilities related to their own states, but also assume responsibilities related to the future development of the entire Malaya. The central authority of the new Federation of Malaya is the Governor, the Legislative and Executive Committees, and a state committee is set up in each state, which is given appropriate powers by the central authority. An important provision of the new policy is the establishment of Malayan Federation citizenship, and anyone born in Malaya will be granted Malayan citizenship. Singapore, with its economic and social interests differing from those of the peninsula, will not be incorporated into the Federation for the time being, but merger may be considered in the future if necessary.

### Zeiss Factory Equipment Emptied by Soviets

[Reuters, Dresden, Germany, 23rd] According to the Potsdam Agreement on reparations, the Soviet Union has transported all or part of the machinery of 403 large and small factories in Ponxsoni back to the Soviet Union. Among them, there must be very important factory equipment, but since it is impossible to obtain a list of the disassembled parts, its value cannot be estimated. It is not known whether the world-renowned Zeiss Ikon factory, which is located in Dresden and specializes in manufacturing cameras, optical instruments, and telescopes, is also among the disassembled factories.

### General Hodge Issues Statement Denying Rumors

[United Press, Seoul, 23rd] The rumor that the troops of General Hodge, commander of the US occupation forces in Korea, expressed opposition to the Moscow Conference's resolution to establish a five-year trusteeship system, was formally denied by General Hodge today. He said: "The rumors about incidents arising from his troops are all baseless." After seeing the TASS news report, General Hodge said that he would work hard to clarify the current situation and at the same time enable the Korean people to have a correct understanding of the issue of international trusteeship. He said that freedom of speech, publication, and assembly are permitted in areas under US jurisdiction, and he believes that this may have caused misunderstandings.

### Serious Labor Strikes in the US

[Reuters, New York, 23rd] US Assistant Secretary of Labor Gibson announced last night that after 263,000 meat canning workers went on strike, the government may take over the striking factories today. Treasury Secretary Vinson and Attorney General Clark consulted with President Truman yesterday, probably to discuss the detailed procedures for the takeover. President Truman's press secretary, Ross, said that the White House had no definite new plan to deal with the steel industry strike, which affected over 1,200 factories. The current steel strike has affected the national railway utilities and the construction industry.

### Local Dispatches

Suzhou: Gangsters Rob Liner and Shoot Passengers. The Yuanhe steamboat of the Tongyuan Shipping Bureau, which departed from Huzhou at 6:00 AM on the 20th, was robbed by bandits at 9:00 PM that day, when it was passing the Jiapu Bridge in Wujiang. Suddenly, ninety bandits came, riding five or six bandit boats, each holding guns and weapons, and firing shots, ordering the ship to stop. The bandits swarmed onto the ship, first disarming the escort soldiers, then shooting and robbing at will, shooting and killing a female passenger, Luo Tingbao, who was shot twice and died on the spot. The bandits then fled. After the ship returned to Suzhou, it reported to the military police and the local court for inspection. It was said that the loss from this robbery was extremely large.

Wuxi: Investigating the Economic Situation in Rural Areas. After the victory, the economic situation in rural areas in the Jiangnan area has not improved. The prevalence of usury has left farmers, who have suffered for eight years, still unable to catch their breath. In view of this, the government authorities are actively planning countermeasures to provide agricultural loans. It is reported that the Zhenjiang branch of the China Farmers Bank has sent Yao Gonglv, director of the Agricultural Loan Department of the bank, to Wuxi to investigate the economic situation in rural areas and collect relevant information in order to handle agricultural loans in the province. He has also sent an official letter to the Wuxi County Government to assist in the process.

Changzhou: Chairman Su Sends Telegram Welcoming Supervising Commissioner Cheng. On the day after Supervising Commissioner Cheng Zhongxing arrived in Changzhou on his inspection tour (the 21st), a forum was held at the Chamber of Commerce with local public organizations, attended by representatives from 53 units and more than 160 local elders. Commissioner Cheng said in his speech: "Inspecting the counties is not to engage in propaganda, but to be determined to put it into practice. When I was in Wuxi, I inspected the detention room and found that suspects were being detained arbitrarily. I immediately instructed the court to handle it. I once pointed out that a general social phenomenon is a cause for concern. I hope to assist in the investigation." After the speech, representatives of various public organizations expressed their opinions, and Commissioner Cheng instructed most of them to submit written requests for further action. In a separate conversation with reporters on the evening of the 21st, he said: "The spirit of the people in Changzhou seems to be quite depressed." Cheng is scheduled to inspect the judiciary on the 22nd. Chairman Su Wang Maogong sent a "special telegram welcoming" him to Zhenjiang to "inspect the customs and law." He is scheduled to leave Changzhou at 1:00 PM on the 23rd.

Songjiang: Tangqiao Robbery Causes Heavy Losses. In Tangqiao Township, Sijing District, Songjiang County, on the night of the 19th of this month, four bandits, speaking with a foreign accent, three wearing uniforms and one in civilian clothes, holding box guns and handguns, swarmed into the house of Tang Kunsheng in Xidongjing, forcing him to guide them. They then robbed the houses of Qiang Liu successively, taking away 15 million yuan in puppet currency, Zhang Boxing, taking away more than 200,000 yuan in puppet currency, the Zhang family, taking away ten large boxes of cigarettes, and more than 10,000 yuan in legal currency, the Zhu Shukun family, taking away a coat. Later, they also robbed pedestrian Huang Musheng of 8 million yuan in puppet currency, Wang Ergong of more than 12 million yuan in paper money, and Zhang Heshang's wife of 3 million yuan in paper money. When the villagers saw that the situation was bad, they beat gongs and shouted for help, and the bandits fled with their loot.

Qingdao: Allied Forces Assist in Disarming Japanese Troops. In Laoshan, Jiaoxian, Chengyang, Jimo, and other areas, the troops of the Japanese Independent Mixed Brigade No. 5, with the assistance of the headquarters of the 6th Marine Division of the Allied Navy, have been carrying out disarming operations under the responsibility of Wang Yuzhi, commander of the 166th Division of the National Army's 8th Army, since the 13th of this month. All Japanese troops were disarmed on the 16th. The remaining materials left by the Japanese troops in the Jimo area were also transported and concentrated on the 19th. The unarmed Japanese troops have now been sent to concentration camps to await repatriation.

### Azure Waves, Distant Mountains Verdant: Like Stepping into Paradise - From Keelung Port to Taipei - Our Newspaper's Shipping Report

— Sent from Taiwan by Hu Weichang, Yao Jiguang, and others

Sailing for three days on a route where naval mines had not yet been completely cleared, we arrived safely at Keelung, truly fortunate! Rising at seven o'clock this morning, I gazed from the ship's bow. Soon, a picturesque scene unfolded, with one or two sailboats on the vast ocean, the tide rising and falling, the azure blue of the sea contrasting beautifully with the verdant green of the distant mountains. The ship rocked violently, but as the steamer entered the harbor, it felt like stepping into a painting. Surrounded by green hills and clear waters, with warships and sailboats arrayed in the bay, and houses scattered on the mountainsides, the beauty of this place can truly rival the paradise of legends.

Like American Soldiers in Shanghai - Strolling in Taipei

After disembarking, we and the other Taipei-bound passengers boarded a motorboat to cross the bay, then took a train. The seats were very comfortable, and as we passed through the Sanshandong (Three Mountain Caves) area, the continuous mountains and rivers along the way were a feast for the eyes, so beautiful that I had never seen such scenery in my life. Upon arriving in Taipei, a special car from the Industrial and Mining Affairs Office picked us up and took us to the Water and Electricity Committee's club for temporary accommodation. Upon leaving the station, wide avenues and towering buildings stretched before our eyes, though many had been destroyed. The trees along the way were lush and lovely. The population here is sparse, far less than Shanghai. The club is located beside a main road, facing mountains and rivers, backed by Yizheng Mountain. The scenery is beautiful, and the air is fresh. Climbing the stairs for a panoramic view is invigorating and pleasant. The climate is warm like spring, and there is no need to wear heavy coats or cotton underwear. After buying a street map of Taipei, we wandered around the city, feeling like American soldiers in Shanghai, not knowing where to go. Passersby looked at us with curious eyes.

Wooden Clogs Predominate over Leather Shoes - Linen Uniforms

Here, a haircut costs six Taiwanese dollars, peanuts cost ten dollars a pound, a mat costs two hundred and fifty dollars, pork costs thirty-four dollars a pound, and fruit is especially cheap. We took a detour to inspect the magnificent buildings of the old Governor-General's Office and other government buildings, regrettably destroyed. We only saw American sailors selling "Camel" cigarettes. The result of the local people being squeezed by the Japanese is a severe shortage of supplies, especially cloth and clothing, which are very expensive. There are very few well-dressed people on the streets, and few wear leather shoes. Most wear wooden clogs, and some wear rubber galoshes. Some clothes are even made of linen.

Feasting on Oranges and Jackfruit - Delicious and Inexpensive

In the evening, we went to the "New China" restaurant for dinner. The restaurant was very elegant, the food was excellent, and there were four Taiwanese waitresses who were very attentive. They wore qipaos with medium sleeves, were slender, barefoot, and wore old leather shoes. After dinner, we feasted on oranges and jackfruit, which were cheap and delicious, costing about two Taiwanese dollars per pound. Nearby was the "Carbinel" dance hall, located in a room on the third floor. There was no band, only records playing softly, but it was constantly welcoming guests. The dancers were far inferior to those in Shanghai. The dancers consisted primarily of American soldiers and compatriots from Shanghai. We slept on "tatami" mats. There were many mosquitoes, so we had to use mosquito nets.

I have only been here for two days and have hastily written the above simple report amidst the chaos. Tomorrow, I may go to Beitou Hot Springs. I will describe my travels in detail later, so I will not elaborate further here. (Sent by Hu Weichang)

Starting with Special Industries - New Price Limits

Recently, prices in Taiwan have risen sharply, with merchants fueling the trend, seemingly without end. The Taiwan Provincial Administrative Governor's Office has instructed the Civil Affairs Department, the Police Department, and municipal governments to urgently seek countermeasures to suppress prices. They have repeatedly convened discussions with relevant industries and decided to start with special industries to conserve consumption. The regulations are as follows: (1) For hotels, the daily rate per room shall not exceed thirty dollars, and for ordinary hotels, it shall not exceed eight dollars. Hotels are not allowed to accommodate prostitutes, except for small inns. (2) Haircuts: The maximum price is six dollars, and electric perms are ten dollars. (3) Dance halls: Dance tickets cost twelve dollars for two books of ten. (4) Movie theaters: New films cost four dollars or less, old films cost two dollars or less, and children and soldiers pay half price. (5) For geishas pouring wine and singing ceremonial songs, a session with one geisha shall not exceed one thousand dollars. For a "heavenly official" (ceremonial performance) with five people or less, each person is five dollars per session.

Grade A Local Cuisine Limited to Five Hundred Dollars per Table

(6) Restaurants: Divided into three grades: A, B, and C. For local cuisine, the maximum price per table is five hundred dollars for Grade A, four hundred dollars for Grade B, and three hundred dollars for Grade C. Tips are limited to a maximum of 10%. The standard for each table is ten people. Western food: Limited to seven courses per person, divided into two-dollar and one-dollar options. Tips are limited to 10%. Diners eating in the dining hall are exempt from giving tips. (7) Rice dishes: Regardless of vegetarian or meat dishes, the maximum price for each dish shall not exceed one to five dollars.

Province Re-divided into Eight Counties - "Gun" and "Street" Changed to District Offices

Taiwan originally used place names such as "State," "Gun," and "Street." From this day forward, all will be changed to the "County System." The province is now divided into eight counties: Taipei, Taichung, Tainan, Hsinchu, Kaohsiung, Taitung, Hualien, and Penghu, with the eight "States" becoming eight counties. Next, "Gun" and "Street" will also be changed to District Offices. If the names already decided are inappropriate, research is currently underway. January 16th. (Sent by Jiguang)

Although Taiwan's railways were developed and operated by the Japanese, their initial construction was by the Chinese. The construction of China's railways began in the early years of the Guangxu Emperor with the Shanghai-Wusong section. However, after the completion of the line, it was opposed by the officials and gentry of Shanghai. Although the line was completed, it was shelved and even regarded as scrap iron. At that time, Liu Mingchuan was governing Taiwan and adopted the policy of developing and revitalizing industry. Seeing that the railway materials were abandoned and useless, he submitted a memorial in the thirteenth year of Guangxu, requesting that the railway be dismantled and moved to Taiwan, where it was rebuilt as the Taipei-Keelung section. Later, it was extended from Keelung to Hsinchu, becoming China's second railway.

Our Country's Earliest Railway - Built in Taiwan Province

After the signing of the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in order to control all of Taiwan and strengthen its exploitation, Japan vigorously developed Taiwan's transportation, making its roads accessible in all directions and completing its military occupation. Military occupation was followed by economic exploitation. In Taiwan, Japan not only completed various monopolies but also encouraged large enterprises and the private property system. Taiwan's private railways were developed and established under the support of this policy. Today, the length of private railway lines exceeds that of government-operated lines, and the reason lies in this.

Before Japan's surrender, the management of all of Taiwan's railways was under the jurisdiction of the Railway Department of the Taiwan Governor-General's Office's Transportation Bureau. Under the department were the Taipei, Kaohsiung, and Hualien Port offices, as well as the Kaohsiung and Taipei repair workshops. Currently, all are taken over by the Transportation Department of the Taiwan Administrative Governor's Office, and a Railway Committee has been established to be responsible for their management.

Government-Operated Railways, East and West - Showing Signs of Congestion

Taiwan's government-operated railways are divided into eastern and western sections. The operating mileage of the eastern section's main and branch lines is 725.3 kilometers, the operating mileage of the western section's main and branch lines is 175.9 kilometers, and the total length of double-track siding is 724.9 kilometers, with a total length of 1626.1 kilometers.

After Japan's surrender, the various vehicles taken over by the Transportation Department include:

Locomotives: 240 - Currently repaired and in use: 199

Passenger cars: 518 - Currently repaired and in use: 36

Freight cars: 5892 - Currently repaired and in use: 5043

Due to the damage to Taiwan's railways caused by wartime bombing, railway transportation cannot be restored to its pre-war peaceful transport capacity, resulting in congestion. At the same time, the progress of repair work is encountering some difficulties due to the lack of materials and workshop machinery.

Taiwan's railway tracks are different from those of the mainland and other railways. The eastern section's tracks are two feet six inches wide, while the western section's are three feet six inches wide. Some private railways even have tracks as narrow as two feet wide. During the repair work, the first thing felt was the lack of parts and materials. During the Japanese rule of Taiwan, all important material supplies relied on Japan. Taiwan had no ability to be self-sufficient. The blockade imposed on Taiwan in recent years by the war has exhausted the materials accumulated in the past. Now, domestic production is impossible, which has created the phenomenon that Taiwan's railway transport capacity exceeds its own carrying capacity.

There are a total of 189 railway stations in Taiwan. However, the number of personnel taken over today is too small, the number of train trips has also been reduced, and the number of travelers has increased after the suspension of automobiles. These are also factors contributing to the congestion of Taiwan's railway transportation.

In the past, the revenue and expenditure of Taiwan's railways had an annual surplus. Even in the Japanese-drafted annual budget for the past year, there was a slight surplus: revenue was 65,166,760 Japanese yen, and expenditure was 48,436,903 Japanese yen.

Although the destruction of the war reduced the revenue of this budget by 30%, it was still able to maintain its balance. Up until Japan's surrender, we were unable to obtain accurate figures. However, after the Transportation Department took over all of Taiwan's government-operated railways, the revenue for October of the past year was 6,948,003 Taiwanese dollars, the revenue for November was 6,931,911 Taiwanese dollars, and the revenue for December was 7,338,834 Taiwanese dollars. However, the expenditure for December of the same year reached 17 million Taiwanese dollars, a difference of 10 million from the revenue. If the cost of repair projects is added to the expenditure, the difference would be even more staggering. The main reasons for the imbalance between revenue and expenditure are that employee salaries have increased, ticket prices are too low, and there are too many passengers without tickets. Currently, the Transportation Department is rectifying order and is also planning to petition the authorities to increase ticket prices to make up for the deficit.

Private Railways Are Very Developed - 9,000 Kilometers Long

The construction of Taiwan's private railways was initially for the purpose of transporting raw materials for the sugar industry. At first, it was limited to the construction of railways between sugarcane fields and factories. Later, to facilitate the transportation of products, it was extended to connect with government-operated railways. Part was used for its own operations, and part was used to sell passenger tickets and operate commercially. Later, the industrial and mining industries followed suit, resulting in the development of Taiwan's private railways.

According to statistics from September of the 34th year of the Republic of China, the situation of private railways in the province is as follows: (Due to war damage, two-fifths of each line was lost.)

Total operating lines are 673.9 kilometers, and dedicated lines are 2351.5 kilometers. Currently, the private railways have not yet been taken over by the Transportation Department and are still being reorganized by the associations themselves. Some have been restored and are open to traffic, but all depend on the start of operations in factories. (Sent by Jin Dezhang on January 15th)

### Winter in Fuzhou

— Our Newspaper's Shipping Report on the 17th, Sent by Zeng Jinke

Fuzhou seems to have no winter.

The winter climate in Fuzhou seems to be like the late spring in Jiangnan. It is rare for Fuzhou to have snow in decades. Although it is now winter, not to mention Beijing, Shanghai has already turned on the heat or lit stoves. In Fuzhou, not only have I not seen anyone wearing fur coats or fur overcoats, but even those wearing lined overcoats are few.

But Fuzhou is not a tropical place.

The Climate Is Too Good - Women Do Not Marry Men from Other Provinces - Perhaps because the climate is too good, most men in Fuzhou are unwilling to work in other provinces. Some who go to other provinces cannot get used to it and soon return. Most women in Fuzhou are also unwilling to marry men from other provinces. Even if they marry men from other provinces, if her husband wants to return to his hometown or work in another province, she is unwilling to go with him. There are even those who are forced to go halfway but escape back to Fuzhou. This is truly an interesting and inexplicable thing.

During the Anti-Japanese War, Fuzhou was occupied twice, but apart from the concrete fortifications built on the streets and the provincial hospital that was deliberately destroyed by the enemy with explosives and has not yet been repaired, there are no traces of war in the entire city of Fuzhou. Compared with other major cities that have experienced war, Fuzhou can be said to be blessed.

Men and Women in Military Uniform - Their Footprints Are Everywhere - Coming to Fuzhou again in winter, it seems particularly lively. First, the 208th and 209th divisions of the Youth Army came to Fuzhou. Young men and women in military uniform can be encountered everywhere. The 208th Division held an exhibition of soldiers' works at the New Life Club, as well as a morning review and performance, which many people visited. It also held a viewing party to entertain the parents of the Fuzhou conscripts. The 209th Division also held an evening party to entertain people from all walks of life in Fuzhou and had drama and film performances. The 208th Division held the National Construction Cup and Army Building Cup ball games at the Youth Association ball field, which was lively for several days. Then, the provincial government moved back to Fuzhou from Yong'an, and welcome arches were erected on all the major streets. The provincial party headquarters and the Youth League branch also moved back to Fuzhou soon after, and it was lively again as usual. A few days ago, the Fujian Regional Direct Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance was established. The directors of the branch offices and tax collection offices of all counties in the province, as well as some tax officials, came to Fuzhou to pay respects to the new director, and the hotels and restaurants were especially lively.

Hot Spring Bathhouses - Can Improve Human Health - Fuzhou has many hot spring bathhouses (all in the east of the city). The water contains sulfur minerals, and frequent bathing can improve health. (This is something that Shanghai does not have.) Among these bathhouses, "Baihe" and "Mingyuan" have the best facilities, but the water in those two is not as good as "Fulongquan" and "Letianquan," which are far away in the suburbs near the airport, and are often visited by couples. The larger bathhouses all have dining rooms attached. Business is even more prosperous in winter.

The Commercial Market Is Prosperous - Unusually Active in Secret - Although prices are thousands of times higher than before the war, Fuzhou's commerce is becoming increasingly prosperous. The large businesses in Shanghang Street and Xiahang Street are all wholesaling or hoarding in large quantities in secret and do not do retail business. Merchants from western and northern Fujian who come to Fuzhou to buy goods stay in those businesses and do not need to stay in hotels. Since the restoration of transportation between Shanghai and Taiwan, Fuzhou merchants (a portion of whom are civil servants) have become even more active. Restaurants and dance halls are their major customers.

During the Winter Defense Period - Eleven Pairs of Leather Shoes Were Stolen from a Suitcase - It is now the winter defense period, and the provincial government has even issued an order prohibiting traffic after 10 PM. As a result, the business of dance halls has been greatly affected. I don't know what happened, but the ban was lifted the next evening! Does that mean that there are no problems with public security in Fuzhou? Not really. One night, eleven pairs of leather shoes were stolen from a suitcase in the store of Cai Youlan, chairman of the Fuzhou Chamber of Commerce. The value is said to be over ten million.

The death of the young woman Zhang Yuzhen due to an abortion has been heavily reported in all Fuzhou newspapers, which is also a reflection of Fuzhou society.

### The Plight of Farmers in Changshu

Editor: We, the passionate people of Changshu,

With the utmost sincerity, beg to borrow your esteemed newspaper's precious

Space to publish the following letter. We will be immensely grateful.

Changshu has long been calling for "revitalizing the countryside" and "universalizing education." What wonderful terms! However, education has not improved, and the countryside has instead been ravaged. Looking back at the past puppet organizations, there were military rice, grain rice, military wheat, business fees, cattle donations, pig donations, and boat damages. Almost everything the common people owned became the object of donations. - Especially Changshu, with its countless exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous donations, ruthlessly extracted the blood and sweat of farmers by various means. The compatriots under the iron heel endured it. Although they dared not openly resist at that time, they cursed in unison, and complaints filled the air. We poor farmers could not support our parents above nor provide for our wives and children below. Although we toiled throughout the year, we could not avoid hunger and cold. In the blink of an eye, eight years passed, and the invaders had surrendered. The people all looked up in anticipation, believing that the various oppressions suffered by farmers, workers, and laborers could be liberated from now on. However, reality has disappointed us. Look! The Communist Party is again killing on a large scale, and thieves have reappeared on a small scale. Let us return to Changshu. The "Merchant Four, People Six Loan" of the previous day was vigorously supported by the people. Although government funding is needed, how can it only be dependent on the haggard farmers? Recently, military grain is again being collected, and rent rice is again being pursued. Although rent rice is calculated at 60% of the normal rate, they are daydreaming and calculating it at the market price, which is actually higher than last year's "100%." We farmers are kind and cannot resist the order, so we have to endure the pain and pay the rent. We are afraid that if we delay, the "Rent Collection Office" will calculate it at 75%. I saw with my own eyes the other day that more than four thousand yuan (national currency) was paid per stone (unit of volume), which actually exceeded the value of one stone of rice. It turns out that the official price is 4,550 yuan in legal tender, and calculated at 75%, each stone of rent is 3,187.5 yuan in legal tender, plus 400 yuan for miscellaneous expenses and 400 yuan for certificate fees. The deliveryman's snack money and the local thank-you money! Alas! How can our farmers' labor of a year, with the limited autumn harvest, fill the endless desires? Especially in Changshu, the "tax collectors" wear coats and carry suitcases, acting in a grand manner and claiming to be officially appointed. They make trouble at every turn, and a group of "account managers" abuse their power and bully people. The "lackeys" also strut around and show off. This makes our farmers hate farming very much. Although this year we can barely support ourselves by selling rice to pay the rent, our parents, wives, and children will not have enough to eat at the beginning of the year! (The writer has been in this situation year after year, suffering unspeakable hardship.) If the price of rice goes up a lot, we will have to measure every grain we eat and will definitely suffer from hunger and cold. At that time, we will look at our own fields and cannot but plant them. If we do not plant them, we will lose our jobs, and if we lose our jobs, we will starve to death. So we have to endure it, hold back our tears, tighten our belts, sometimes "breathing like a cow" and sometimes "sweating like porridge." We then use human power to "draw water" and "divide the fields." The writer will again compare the cost of planting each acre of land, labor, fertilizer (about 1.6 stones of rice) and the autumn harvest (about 1.7 stones). Then it will be known that the farmers' income does not meet their expenses. If you add the rent, wouldn't they lose a lot of capital? However, the men in our village go out to work (as partners, servants, or peddlers to make a living), and farming is done entirely by women and children, so production is greatly reduced. Moreover, they often conform to this poem - "Silkworms in February spin new silk; mulberry leaves in May are newly destroyed; curing the immediate pain, cutting out the flesh of the heart." Living like this, "eating the grain of the year of the Rooster before the year of the Rabbit is over", is even more overwhelming. As one who claims to "govern the world through knowledge and cultivate the land through strength," I have also reached a dead end because I am unwilling to do things under the puppet organization. - Now I hope that the government will earnestly reduce rent, level prices, and open up sources of income. This is what is beneficial to the countryside. The grain purchased by the provincial government the other day, although a large amount of 60,000 stones, was handled by rice merchants, so there was not much direct pain, only indirect impact. Now the county government is going to handle grain, but it is focusing on the township and village chiefs, allocating it according to the land. The price is 4,500 yuan in legal tender, and a deposit of 10% is paid first. The rest is flying in the sky, I will not discuss it for the time being. I heard that the first district is handling 6,000 stones. Think about it: the towns in the city cannot produce rice. At the township chief meeting the other day, each household had to pay at least five dou (unit of volume), and some even had to pay several stones. How can our farmers afford it? It can be said with certainty that this method must be improved. Otherwise, it will definitely lead to turmoil and theft. The urgent task of "universalizing education" and "revitalizing the countryside" cannot be delayed any longer. Then there will be no room for corrupt officials to exist! The young man who is plowing and sighing, having eaten some thin porridge on the morning of the tenth day of the first month, wrote this in the cold and desolate rural under the dilapidated thatched roof.

### Political Consultative Conference Snippets: Zhang Shenfu Discusses "Spoils System" Jokes, Co-Discusses Huang Yanpei's "Piglet" Logic

— Special dispatch from Chongqing by Pu Dejie

The fourth meeting of the "Political Consultative Conference" (PCC) was held at 9:00 AM on the 15th. Zhang Junli, Mo Dehui, and Ye Jianying were absent due to matters of importance. Wang Shijie and Deng Xianchao were on sick leave. Thirty-three members attended. Chairman Sun Ke announced that the secretariat had not received any proposals that could be used as a basis for discussion. He requested that everyone express their opinions on the programmatic issues. Members from various factions expressed their opinions at opportune moments. Zhang Shenfu spoke first and mentioned the People's Liberty Protection League in order to reassure the audience and let the people know that the meeting was for the benefit of the people, and not for some people to seek official positions and divide the spoils. When Wu Tiecheng spoke about the form of the program, he said that he attended a symposium last night and heard people criticize the Political Consultative Conference as a factional meeting, even a spoils-sharing meeting. He stated that it was better to have a political agreement like the parties in the United States during wartime, instead of beautifying the name with some kind of program to impose on the common people. He conveyed this to everyone for reference. After Dong Biwu of the Chinese Communist Party and Chang Naihui of the Youth Party expressed their detailed opinions, Fa Ji suggested, "Do not use harsh words like 'spoils system' in the meeting. In foreign countries, 'Spoij Syete' means a one-party dictatorship dividing spoils and titles." Regarding the opinion that it was a factional meeting, he said that the important document of the English constitution, the "Magna Carta" of 1215, was originally only an agreement between nobles and the emperor. Luo enumerated the provisions of the "Magna Carta," saying that it did not matter that outsiders said that party agreements had no legal basis, as long as they could represent the interests of the people, they could be regarded as a "Magna Carta." Chen Bulei then agreed with Zhang's opinion, saying that "spoils system," "coalition government," "secret agents," and other "harsh" terms should not be used in this harmonious meeting. Subsequently, Zhang Shenfu admitted that the members of the conference were not elected by the people, but recommended by various parties, but the parties should represent the people, so it was an indirect representation of the people. He emphasized that the will of the people was not difficult to know. Afterwards, industrialist Li Zhukang presented his economic plan for the country, farmers, and workers, saying, "The government should solve the difficulties of farmers, and industry should make people work harder." He spoke about many methods of constructing farmland irrigation and passionately appealed for the party to withdraw from factories, so that labor disputes would not remain unresolved, affecting production. By this time, it was almost one o'clock. Fu Sinian gave up his chance to speak, but Huang Yanpei stood up and loudly presented his "piglet" logic, saying, "How can the dignified power of the National Government be called spoils?" While advocating that "from today onwards, everyone must not use the word 'spoils system'," he used the phrase a few more times. Then, Wu Tiecheng stood up again and solemnly stated, "The spoils system is the opinion of outsiders. He was only telling a joke for everyone's reference." At this point, the chairman announced that the issue would be handed over to a small group for discussion. The Secretary-General reported the list of small group assignments. Wang Yunwu suggested that Fu Sinian, a non-party member nominated as a drafter of the program, be added to the second group, which everyone agreed to. As Fu was about to speak, Zhang Qun stood up, waved his briefcase, and shouted, "Isn't there not enough time! Why bother!" and adjourned the meeting. The word "spoils system" will not appear in the Consultative Conference, but in order to prevent it from appearing among the common people, the members of the conference should engrave these two words in their hearts. This is the opinion of the general public, and also the hope of the people across the country. (Night of January 15th)

Editorial

### Basic Understanding That Should Be Present When Discussing the Constitutional Draft

The Political Consultative Conference has had heated discussions on the draft constitution, and it is said that the differences in opinions between the various parties are quite large. As the constitution is the fundamental law of the country, it should be carefully studied. However, there are a few points worth noting in regards to the discussion of the constitutional draft: Firstly, the "May 5th" constitutional draft, drafted by the Legislative Yuan and promulgated by the National Government, is, as the name suggests, merely a draft proposal and is not absolutely unmodifiable. After the National Assembly is convened, it can certainly make necessary amendments to the draft proposal to accommodate the valuable opinions gathered from all sides. Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan and representative of the government, stated at the PCC meeting, "If there are any places in the constitutional draft that need to be amended, they can certainly be accommodated," which has shown the government's frank attitude. Some people believe that the Legislative Yuan drafted the constitution before the current war, and the situation is very different from today, so it must be modified. Others say that the Legislative Yuan is a government agency and cannot represent the will of the people in drafting the constitution, so it must be amended. Still others say that the constitutional draft was drafted under a one-party dictatorship and should adopt the opinions of all parties and factions, and cannot impose the concept of one-party rule on all parties and factions. Whether these arguments are completely correct is worth paying attention to.

The constitution is the fundamental law of the country, and it should not change frequently due to changes in the times. If we say that our country's constitutional draft was drafted before World War II, and the current situation is different, so it must be modified, then we might as well ask, the US constitution was drafted in 1788, and has gone through many wars, so it should also be modified frequently. However, the US constitution is still largely the old thing drafted in 1788. As for the Legislative Yuan's drafting of the constitutional draft, it was originally based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings; it is not a constitution-making body, but only a body for drafting a constitutional draft, and constitution-making is the business of the National Assembly. If it is said that the concept of one party cannot be imposed on all parties, then that is also an unreasonable statement. Today's parties, including the Communist Party, have all publicly recognized the Three Principles of the People as the supreme principle of nation-building. The Three Principles of the People are no longer the private property of one party. The Legislative Yuan, based on the spirit of the Three Principles of the People, drafted the constitutional draft, and did not forcibly impose the concept of one party on all parties. All of the above cannot be regarded as reasons why the "May 5th" constitutional draft must be modified. However, as mentioned earlier, the Legislative Yuan's drafting of the "May 5th" constitutional draft, although it has been carefully studied and considered repeatedly, is still afraid that there are shortcomings. For the sake of gathering ideas and benefiting everyone, if all parties have valuable opinions, they should humbly adopt them, so that the constitutional draft can reach the realm of "supreme good," and there is no need to come up with any big reasons, as if the "May 5th constitutional draft" must be completely overthrown.

In the discussion of the constitutional draft, we must first have a basic understanding, that is, the "May 5th" constitutional draft is the embodiment of the spirit of the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution, and the Three Principles of the People are the supreme principle of our nation-building, and have been recognized by all parties. Therefore, the discussion and amendment of the constitutional draft should be based on the premise of not going beyond the spirit of the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution evolved from the Three Principles of the People. Any amendment that can make the constitutional draft more perfect, and at the same time better promote the spirit of the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution, can be adopted as the basis for amendment. When we talk about the National Assembly, we will say: "Today, the members of the PCC are gathered in the capital. Do not think that you are reforming the law or carrying out a political revolution that is bleeding or preparing to bleed. Rather, it is under the publicly recognized leadership of the Kuomintang and under the supreme principle of adhering to the Three Principles of the People for nation-building, on the basis of the political system established by the Kuomintang, frank and public consultation and negotiation on certain current political issues are carried out, seeking further coordination after discussion." We must first have this basic understanding, and then study the constitutional draft, so that we can proceed calmly and achieve the effect of striving for perfection.

The Three Principles of the People has its own political system, and this system should be expressed in the Five-Power Constitution. The formation of this political system is the result of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's years of research and revolutionary experience. The "May 5th constitutional draft" is a constitutional draft produced by the "Five-Power Constitution" theory. It does not adopt the representative system and parliamentary politics popular in Europe and the United States in their entirety, but extracts the essence of Western European democratic politics, and integrates it with our country's inherent excellent traditions, creating a political system unique to the Three Principles of the People. In addition to political power, there is also the power of governance. Under the power of governance, in addition to the three powers of legislation, administration, and judiciary, there are also the two powers of supervision and examination. This is a new political attempt, and we should cherish this attempt very much. Western political scholars, limited by their own political experience, have failed to make a detached and objective review of the political system that the Three Principles of the People wants to establish, which is understandable, but we Chinese should liberate ourselves from the political prejudices of Westerners. Because the power of the five branches is a new invention in politics, and there are no established rules in Western Europe to follow, this has already been mentioned in Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings. Therefore, if we only know how to follow the representative system of Western Europe, or the "Soviet" political system established in the Soviet Union, and insist on comparing it with the political system that the Three Principles of the People wants to establish, then it can really be said to be irrelevant, just like the American law PhD who studied in the United States thirty years ago said to Dr. Sun Yat-sen that he "only knew about the separation of three powers, and never heard of the five-power constitution," which is laughable.

Some people said a few days ago: "The powers of the National Assembly could be exercised by the Legislative Yuan, why is there a need for such a huge organization?" Others said: "The Legislative Yuan can be used as the lower house, and the Control Yuan as the upper house, and the powers of the two-house system of various countries can be used. The names of the two houses remain the same, but the powers are expanded. There is no need for the name of the congress, but the reality of the congress." We listened, and could only admire the death-defying skills of political commentators. We believe that if the Three Principles of the People has shortcomings, these shortcomings are not in the political system it wants to establish. The political system that the Three Principles of the People wants to establish has a consistent system, and the links within it are strict, like a large building, and no brick or stone can be removed or arbitrarily patched. For example, the National Assembly and the Legislative Yuan are clearly two different things. The former is the body that monopolizes "political power," and the latter is part of the five "governing powers." Under the system of the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution, the series are clearly defined, so how can they be mixed up? To be honest, if the members of the PCC are determined to overthrow Dr. Sun Yat-sen's precious theory of "separation of functions," and want to abolish Dr. Sun Yat-sen's proposition of the five branches of government standing side by side, then why not simply and boldly overthrow and abolish it, and instead want to steal the sky and change the sun, move flowers and connect trees, pretending to have the "tiger skin" of the Five-Power Constitution, and secretly attacking the "donkey body" of parliamentary politics, to deceive others and deceive themselves? If Dr. Sun Yat-sen knew in the afterlife that the theory of "separation of powers and abilities," which is the essence of the "Five-Power Constitution" spirit, was discarded like worn-out shoes by some politicians who only read Western books, and that those who believe in Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings also turned a blind eye, I really don't know how sad he would be!

### Any Labor Disputes: Municipal Government Hopes for Self-Coordination; All Agencies Resolving Labor Disputes Must Register with the Social Affairs Bureau

(Reported by this newspaper) The municipal government authorities, in view of the frequent labor disputes recently and the numerous agencies involved in mediation, which in fact have not achieved satisfactory results, have decided that in the future, any labor disputes should preferably be resolved through self-coordination. If it is necessary to apply to agencies at all levels for mediation, in order to unify procedures and comply with administrative laws and regulations, the agencies must submit a document to the Social Affairs Bureau for application or registration. In the future, when similar events occur again, the Social Affairs Bureau can invite the agency to participate in mediation in order to achieve practical results.

Electric Workers Propose Conditions: The Shanghai Electric Power Company's labor dispute has been mediated by the authorities many times, but it has not yet been resolved. Recently, when the company increased salaries at the end of the year, it failed to do so according to the length of service and the standards of work attendance. Some received more than 200 yuan, while others received only one and a half yuan, which caused dissatisfaction among the employees. The union raised the matter, but there were no results, and the company fired ten union directors. It is also rumored that a large number of workers will be suspended, causing panic among all workers. The employees of the Nanjing Road Main Company and the Fielun Road Distribution Station went to the Yangshupu Power Plant in formation yesterday morning to attend a general meeting and decided to propose eleven conditions to the company, demanding that the company agree to all of them. Otherwise, all 2,800 workers will not leave the factory. Workers in the electricity sector organized a protection team to guard various locations. However, the union declared that it would abide by the intentions of the authorities and not cut off the power. As of last night, there was no news of a resolution. When the factory workers gathered at 3:00 PM yesterday, the company invited a large police detachment with three machine guns to enter the factory to suppress them. However, a company of soldiers was already stationed at the factory for protection, and the police had not notified them in advance, so they could not enter the factory. After negotiations between the responsible officers of the military and police, and after the union telegraphed the party and government agencies to guarantee that the power would not be cut off, the police were ordered to withdraw.

Department Store Employees Slow Down Work: All employees of the city's six major department stores, Wing On, Sincere, Sun Sun, The Sun, China National Goods, and Xunhua, have repeatedly requested improved treatment, but have not been allowed by the company. The employees sent representatives to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition the day before yesterday, but there were no results. Yesterday, from 2:00 PM, they slowed down work for three hours, and business resumed as usual after 5:00 PM. The labor side declared that if the company cannot provide a satisfactory response, they will slow down work for three hours every day.

Barber Workers Strike Yesterday Morning: At about 8:00 AM yesterday, more than 20 barbershops in the Central District began to strike. By the afternoon, the number had increased to more than 100. The workers demanded that the split of the income between the workers and the owners be increased from 40/60 to 35/65, and that the night porridge be changed to night meals. The authorities have begun mediation.

### US Air Force Training Command Celebrates Fourth Anniversary

The US Air Force Headquarters in China announced yesterday that yesterday was the fourth anniversary of the establishment of the US Air Force Training Command. During the four years of World War II, the trained pilots made indelible contributions to defeating the Nazis. The Training Command was headed by General Orland, Commander-in-Chief of the US Air Force, and Generals Strattemeyer, Walter, Carson Smith, and Clumman served as four commanders. Later, General Smith succeeded as Chief of Staff of the US Air Force and in 1943 became Commander-in-Chief of the China-India-Burma Air Force. Last summer, he came to China to serve as Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force. On the fourth anniversary of the establishment of the US Air Force Training Command yesterday, General Smith issued a statement praising the achievements of the US Air Force in the current war and encouraging the Air Force to continue its efforts.

### US Industrial and Commercial Products to be Collected for Exhibition

Lu Jingshi, US commercial attaché and special representative of the State Department in Beijing and Shanghai, believes that American industrial and commercial products are exquisite and novel, and there has never been a systematic display of them in China. He plans to build a site in Shanghai to extensively collect products from major American factories, classify them, and hold a grand exhibition. Preparations have begun. Yesterday, he hosted Chinese and American industrial and commercial leaders. Attendees included American business leaders Frankling, Vonderwarth, Allen, etc., and Chinese business leaders Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, Wu Yunfu, Liu Hongsheng, and Yu Zuoting, etc. Lu Jingshi and Kelley successively delivered speeches, and Frankling, Vonderwarth, Wang Xiaolai, and Wu Yunfu successively delivered speeches, unanimously praising the move and believing that it was a meaningful cooperation between Chinese and American business circles.

### Expanding Nanjing West Road: Horse Racing Club Wall Set Back

[Reported by this newspaper] The road widening project currently being implemented is the area around the Horse Racing Club on Nanjing West Road (Jingan Temple Road). The wall of the Horse Racing Club has been set back, and the river outside the wall will also be filled in the coming days. The formal project to widen the road will begin on March 1st. The widening of Zhejiang Road will be implemented only after all parties have properly planned.

### Supervisory Yuan Inspection Group Attaches Importance to Accusation Cases

The First Inspection Group of the Supervisory Yuan recently made three suggestions to the central government: (1) The authorized agencies handling traitor cases should strictly abide by the provisions of Articles 2 and 3 of the Regulations on Punishing Traitors. (2) Clear and unified implementation procedures and investigation procedures should be specified, and the implementation rules should be strictly observed.

The Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Districts has been in operation for more than two months since the establishment of the investigation and seizure team in mid-November last year. The enemy and puppet concealed properties and materials seized through tipoffs from various parties or by the team itself are quite large in number. The recent acquisitions are even more numerous, and the value is astonishing.

Enemy and Puppet Materials Worth Hundreds of Millions: For example, the team recently seized a large number of enemy and puppet materials in three warehouses in Tianzhu Church, Father King Road, and Jiazhiyi Road, with an estimated value of more than 834.4 million yuan. Among the important materials are more than 2,770 pieces of artificial silk fabrics and silk fabrics, more than 990 pieces of cotton cloth, more than 1,059 pieces of cotton fabrics, more than 1,400 pieces of cotton yarn, more than 100 pieces of wool, more than 800 cans of kerosene and oil, and more than 5,000 pieces of other glass sundries.

### Commemorating the January 28th Incident: The 88th Division Holds Exercises; Division Commander Hu Jiaji Hosts Reporters Yesterday

The Third Front Army Headquarters Office in Shanghai, and the residence of 88th Division Commander Hu Jiaji, will hold exercises on this day in the city center where the January 28th Incident war broke out, in commemoration of the incident. At that time, invitations will be sent to military and government leaders of this city and Chinese and foreign journalists to observe.

Reporting on the Division's Combat Achievements: Division Commander Hu Jiaji hosted reporters from various newspapers in the city at the division headquarters in Jiangwan at 3:00 PM yesterday, with over 40 people attending. Division Commander Hu reported that the division failed to fulfill its responsibilities in the Jinghu Road area during the early stages of the War of Resistance, expressing his regret. He will encourage officers and soldiers to serve the people of Jinghu Road in the future, and at the same time, he hopes that the local elders will regard the officers and soldiers as their own children and cooperate with each other. The division has been established for 18 years. After the August 13th Incident, it was transferred to Nanjing and later participated in the defense battles on the outskirts of Wuhan. Subsequently, it firmly defended the Nujiang River, counterattacked Longling, captured Zhefang, and recovered Wan 町, repeatedly achieving extraordinary feats. On June 21st last year, the National Government specially awarded a silk banner to commend the division for its功 in capturing Longling.

Distributed in the Suburbs of Songhu: Currently, the 88th Division troops are distributed in more than ten locations in the urban suburbs of this city, including Baoshan, Wusong, and Longhua. The Jiangwan city center sports field is also stationed by the division's regimental headquarters. The internal facilities are very neat and tidy, and the equipment is the latest weaponry.

### The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Cables Authorities Requesting Improvement of Land Registration Procedures; Simplification and Reduction of Fees Should Be the Principle

The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent cables to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Land Administration Department of the Executive Yuan, requesting improvements to the land registration procedures in this city and a reduction in fees. "The gist is, Shanghai is the financial center of the country, and land titles represent a large portion of the city's wealth and are the largest chips for financial circulation. If the registration procedures are slow and the tax burden is too heavy, these chips will be frozen and unable to circulate, and the industry will fall into a state of stagnation and collapse. The disastrous drop in real estate prices and the decline in the market after 1932 can serve as a profound lesson. Moreover, this city has just been recovered, and the currency system has changed, which has greatly affected the financial resources of the people. The class of stagnant real estate, especially real estate companies, is particularly affected. If they are ordered to pay excessive cash, their assets will not be enough to cover the expenses, and bankruptcy will follow. This impact should be taken into consideration. In particular, local authorities should strictly abide by the principle of not changing laws and regulations when handling government affairs, so that the previous and subsequent government orders do not conflict, which is enough to make the people jointly abide by them. Based on the above reasons, the current registration methods of the Land Administration Department have been repeatedly invited to the Industrial and Commercial Laws and Regulations Committee, and experts have been gathered to conduct detailed research. The research and suggestions are as follows: (1) All items should be determined as much as possible in accordance with the law, and the levy rate should not be increased under the pretext of increasing municipal financial revenue. (2) The registration deadline is approaching, please approve an extension. (3) The registration procedures should be agile and convenient in principle. (4) The standard for estimating land prices should be changed. (5) Multiple plots of land should be exempt from the fee increase. We hope that you will review and adopt them one by one."

### Three Minor Suggestions

-- Hangzhou · Jiang Yuqing

(1) In Chongqing, whenever the national flag is raised or lowered at the spiritual fortresses, national music must be played, which invigorates the spirit. I believe that in a city as large as Shanghai, this should not be lacking. I now propose that in the circular area at the intersection of Xizang Road and Racecourse Road, a flagpole should be erected in the middle. Every morning and evening, the municipal government should send police officers to play national music and perform the national flag raising and lowering ceremony at the same time. This is a small detail, but it is also a way to educate the public.

(2) According to reports, the Municipal Bureau of Education has a compromise solution for private school fees, which will only increase the burden on parents. Standing in the position of a parent, I would also like to propose a compromise solution: pay fees on a monthly basis. I believe that schools use tuition fees as operating expenses, which are of course paid on a monthly basis. Then students can also pay fees on a monthly basis. This solution is beneficial to parents, and it seems that it is harmless and feasible for schools.

(3) It is reported that the iron gate connecting Shanghai and Nanshi has been removed, which is to eliminate the legacy of the "concession." However, Shanghai is a whole, and everything should be uniform. For example, the use of 110 volts by the French Electricity Company and 220 volts by the American Electricity Company should not be allowed in a single city. I think the municipal authorities should find a way to improve this, so as to show uniformity.

(Editor's Note) The three suggestions made by Mr. Jiang seem ordinary, but they are actually very meaningful. I hope that the responsible officials of the Municipal Police Bureau, the Bureau of Education, and the Bureau of Public Utilities will implement them as soon as possible to live up to the expectations of the readers.

### Spot Transactions Are Few; Gold Market Rises Weakly; US Dollars and Hong Kong Dollars Also Rise

Yesterday, the gold market was stimulated by the sharp rise in northern gold prices, but because of the tight silver supply in the Stock Exchange Building, major players mostly stayed on the sidelines.

In the early morning, it rose slightly to 895,000, with supply exceeding demand. Under the scramble to buy, it broke through the 900,000 mark and rose to 917,000. At this time, the spread for arbitrage of US dollars had widened to 625 yuan per ten taels, causing arbitrage sellers to come out and the price to fall back. The process after entering was mediocre, hovering around 910,000. Until noon, there was no dramatic change. In the afternoon, there were not many spot transactions.

Arbitrage traders came in slightly to absorb the supply, and the price fell from 1,478 yuan to around 1,465 yuan. There were few changes in the middle. In the afternoon, due to the rise in gold futures, the price hovered at 1,480 yuan at the end, resulting in a rebound of 32 yuan. There was gradual arbitrage buying of Hong Kong dollars. Old Hong Kong dollars rebounded by 5 yuan, and although there was a gradual increase in interest in new Hong Kong dollars, there was a lack of sustained momentum. As a result, the price continued to rise by 2 yuan.

According to news from the producing areas, the mountain prices of red and green tea in Hangzhou and Tunxi and other places have also been affected by貨　 in recent days, and have been rising continuously, almost on par with the prices in this city, so people's hearts are becoming more秀, and貨方 are gradually萌非, unwilling to give up their goods without a good price, so although去化 is still smooth, it is not easy for buyers to採納, so the transactions that are being made are also turning reduced, but the market is still俏利 as before, and the market is巍然站挺.

### The Confusion of Hong Kong's Monetary System: Authorities Feel Quite Baffled

(Reuters, Hong Kong, 23rd) The confusion of Hong Kong's monetary system is the most baffling problem for the administrative authorities. Although it is not considered serious at present due to the authorities' promulgation of the suspension of exchange order, this matter must be resolved before the resumption of pre-war trade. During the effective period of the suspension order, old depositors before the Pearl Harbor incident can only withdraw HK$200 per month. There is no solution for pre-war commercial accounts and local stock transactions. Although the Hong Kong dollar is supported by the pound and the US dollar, it has no stable purchasing power. Hong Kong has close ties with China, and the stability of China's politics and finance should help stabilize the Hong Kong dollar. In recent weeks, the Hong Kong dollar has fluctuated with the black market for legal tender and the US dollar. The revival of overseas remittances is also a reason for the depreciation. Superficially, the currency does not seem to depreciate due to needs, but because recipients of remittances do not have normal investment channels, they mostly purchase gold bars and goods, which reduces the purchasing power of the Hong Kong dollar. The inflow of funds is a good phenomenon, but if it is not brought into line, it is enough to induce currency inflation. It is expected that the confusion will be more obvious after the suspension of exchange order is lifted. Recently, some banks have notified those who have made pledges that pledges settled with the Japanese and Tai clearance agents in the past cannot be recognized, and the banks still retain their mortgage rights. The destruction of document records after the Japanese invasion will make it impossible for major import and export companies to sort out their debts and obligations. Furthermore, regarding the issuance of Hong Kong banknotes, at the beginning of the Japanese occupation, the directors of the banks that issued banknotes had to issue a large number of new banknotes under the threat of force. These banknotes have not yet been recognized by the issuing banks, at least for the time being. However, there are informal quotations in Shanghai. Whether these banknotes can be exchanged at a certain exchange rate in the future, the authorities have not given any instructions. The Hong Kong government is making every effort to stabilize finance. The resumption of the stock exchange can absorb a large amount of floating capital and guide it into the right track of investment in enterprises and real estate.

### Border Education After the War: Continuous Improvement of Textbooks in Various Leagues and Banners; Border Schools Will Re-establish in Beijing

(Our Newspaper, Nanjing Special Dispatch) Regarding border education, the Mongolian and Tibetan Education Department of the Ministry of Education was in charge before the war. During the Anti-Japanese War, this education was still actively carried out. Now, at the time of repatriation, it is heard that Nanjing is planning to set up a Border Education Center to prepare for research and compile border writing work (such as Chinese translation comparison texts and dictionaries for Mongolian, Hui, Tibetan, etc.) to assist in the development of border education. At the same time, the Mongolian and Tibetan Department of the Ministry of Education is still continuing to improve the textbooks used in schools in various leagues and banners on the border, in addition to those that have already been published. It is also heard that the Mongolian and Tibetan School, formerly established in Xiaozhuang Central Political School in Nanjing before the war, has long been renamed the Border School and has come to Beijing to try to re-establish.

### Paying Attention to Girls' Education Amidst the Sounds of Zhejiang's Repatriation

(Our Newspaper, Hangzhou) Xu, the Director of the Education Department of Zhejiang Province, is very concerned about the education work after this repatriation. As for the repatriation of girls' education, the department originally planned in December of the 33rd year of the Republic (1944) to stipulate that the Provincial Hangzhou Girls' Middle School should be re-established in Hangzhou in the semester following repatriation. However, because the central government approved the budget for Zhejiang Province in the 35th year of the Republic (1946) according to the large numbers in the previous year's budget, the education funds of the province in the 35th year of the Republic (1946) can only barely maintain the existing business and cannot be restored immediately. In order to thoroughly implement the repatriation plan, Director Xu has compiled another repatriation expenditure budget and submitted it to the provincial government for compilation and to the central government for approval. Once approved, the Provincial Hangzhou Girls' Middle School can be restored. At the same time, in the repatriation expenditure budget, Director Xu not only seeks to restore the Provincial Hangzhou Girls' Middle School, but also plans to add two more provincial girls' middle schools and two girls' normal schools, distributed in eastern Zhejiang, hoping to popularize girls' education in Zhejiang.

### Zhejiang Province Conducts General Registration of Elementary School Teachers; Education Department Sets a Five-Month Deadline for Completion

It is also learned that after the results of this general registration are published, those without a registration certificate will not be allowed to serve as teachers. The Education Department also set a deadline for all counties and cities to complete the work within five months. (Butterfly)

### Salaries of Elementary and Secondary School Teachers in Beijing Adjusted

Municipal Schools Increase Salaries Starting in January; Increased Tuition Fees of Private Schools Adjust Salaries

(Our Newspaper, Nanjing Special Dispatch) Before the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the salaries of elementary and secondary school teachers in Nanjing were extremely meager, barely enough to make a living. After the repatriation of the Social Affairs Bureau of the Nanjing Municipal Government after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, it immediately began to rectify the teaching staff. In mid-October of last year, it held an examination for elementary and secondary school teachers, with approximately 2,000 registered. In late November, the results of the examination were announced, and qualified teachers were admitted. The middle school section had fewer than 200 people, and the elementary school section had more than 700 people. Most of the principals of elementary and secondary schools were changed, and a few were retained and reappointed. Among the teachers and staff of various schools, those who had participated in the examination and were qualified were either retained in their original schools or transferred. Those who were not qualified were eliminated. After employing qualified teachers, the living salaries of teachers and staff were also gradually increased. It is learned that the salary for October was calculated by multiplying the original basic salary by 40 times, plus a living allowance of 5,000 yuan and a rice loan of 3,000 yuan. Therefore, the highest salary for elementary school teachers was no more than 12,000 to 13,000 yuan, and the highest salary for middle school teachers was no more than 16,000 to 17,000 yuan. In November, the "Provisional Standards for the Salaries of Elementary and Secondary School Teachers and Staff in Beijing" were revised. The basic salary of middle school teachers and staff was determined based on the depth of academic qualifications and experience. The basic salary of elementary school teachers and staff was determined based on the number of grades and the comparison of the courses they taught. For example, the highest basic salary for middle school principals was 360 yuan, and the lowest basic salary for vocational teachers was 80 yuan. The highest basic salary for elementary school principals was 240 yuan, and the lowest basic salary for ordinary vocational teachers was 60 yuan. It was calculated by multiplying by 60 times, plus a living allowance of 7,000 yuan and a rice loan of 6,500 yuan (changed to 7,000 yuan in December). Therefore, the highest salary for middle school teachers was more than 20,000 yuan, and the lowest salary for elementary school teachers was more than 16,000 yuan. Starting from January of this year, the "Standard for the Salaries of Public Teachers and Staff Revised by the Executive Yuan" will be followed, and the calculation will be based on multiplying the basic salary by 80 times, plus a living allowance of 28,000 yuan. In this way, the lowest salary for middle school staff will be more than 35,000 yuan, the lowest salary for teachers will be more than 40,000 yuan, and the lowest salary for elementary school principals and head teachers will be more than 35,000 yuan, and the highest can reach more than 40,000 yuan, which is higher than before, and the living can be maintained. It is also heard that after the winter vacation, private middle schools will increase tuition fees. The tuition fee for junior high school will be between 10,000 and 12,000 yuan, and the tuition fee for senior high school will be between 13,000 and 15,000 yuan. Therefore, with this injection, the salaries of teachers in private schools can also be increased to between 20,000 and 35,000 yuan. (Fool)

### Letter of Clarification

To the editor: The letter of clarification published by the Mingxing Perfume Factory in your newspaper on January 20, 35th year of the Republic (1946) is entirely fictitious and not factual. The ownership of our school building has changed hands as many as eight times, resulting in no one to receive the rent. After Zhou Bangjun of Mingxing Perfume Factory purchased the house, he was first threatened by several members of the Special Higher Division of the police bureau, and then commissioned the enemy lawyer Rong Muzhao Chang and the enemy education director Ueno to send letters of intimidation, forcing us to move out. In the end, the Zhongzhina Zhendian Co., Ltd. notified us to take over the disputed property. The facts are all there, and the evidence is conclusive. During the enemy and puppet period, we were harassed repeatedly and suffered greatly. We refused to accept the rent, and there are letters to prove it. The deposit in the court was entirely due to the environment. The so-called rejection by Japanese teachers is purely a fabricated slander after the fact. We are deeply afraid of confusing the public, so we specially request that you correct the facts as they have occurred. This is written by Jingqi, Principal of the Zhong Women's National Elementary School.

Free Talk Special Issue on Women and Family

### Introductory Remarks

— Editor

Starting today, "Free Talk" will be dedicated to publishing articles on women and family every Thursday. At the time of launch, it seems that we should talk about our purpose.

The women's movement has not had a long history in China, but thanks to the efforts of all parties, it has achieved considerable success. In the future, we should refer to the domestic and international situation and strive for further progress. Because in the future, no one can abandon his responsibility to the country and society, and there are many things that require the efforts of the women's community.

Regarding the family, from self to family to clan, it was originally the procedure for building a country in China throughout the ages. Now, when we are starting to build a country, we can devote ourselves to the work of regulating the family, because the work of regulating the family must start with self-cultivation, and extend to the way of governing the family. If Chinese families can get on the right track, every Chinese person will be an excellent citizen; every society in China will be perfect and healthy; so that the work of building a country can be done with half the effort.

The articles published in this journal strive to suit the trend of the times, and also strive to adapt to the national conditions. Because if it suits the trend of the times but does not adapt to the national conditions, it will inevitably become empty talk on paper; if it adapts to the national conditions but does not suit the trend of the times, it will inevitably stick to the old ways. At the beginning of this publication, we sincerely hope that all sectors will give criticism and readers will give correction.

Children

### Preventing Children's Inferiority Complex

— Yang Tongfang

To hope to succeed in anything, the first thing is to have a strong self-confidence. A person without self-confidence, feeling that he is not as good as others in anything, will be discouraged by disappointment and dare not try any work. Anyone without self-confidence will definitely not face reality and will not have the courage and determination to create any career.

The lack of self-confidence will lead to a feeling of inferiority. The formation of an inferiority complex not only affects one's own career, but also has the danger of becoming a psychological aberration. Many mental patients initially start with a sense of inferiority. Originally, everyone has a tendency for "self-expression," and there is no such thing as an inferiority complex. But why do some people have a feeling of inferiority? Most failures easily make people feel frustrated and disheartened, and eventually develop an inferiority complex. It is common for parents not to understand their children's interests and abilities, and to place their hopes too high. The results shown by their children often differ greatly from their parents' hopes. Because children are hit by failure, they lose their self-confidence and develop an inferiority complex. Therefore, the stimulation of success can often encourage children's efforts, and the reaction of failure often causes a feeling of inferiority. Some parents are too doting on their children and do not allow them to feel any difficulties at ordinary times. They do not teach their children to do anything independently. Even ordinary homework practice is done by their parents. This develops an incorrect feeling in children, that is, "everything is easy to succeed." They never know the true meaning of "success." When their children leave their parents and there is no one to help them, they often feel frustrated and disheartened due to failure, to the point of doubting themselves. The bad mentality of timidity and cowardice is formed under such circumstances, and the inferiority complex naturally arises.

We also often see that some teachers, who think they are serious about mathematics, give children overly difficult homework, not understanding the impact of "success" on psychology. Children often encounter failure and rarely have the opportunity to gain the satisfaction of "success." These teachers believe that the more students who fail in a class, the more it shows that they are serious about mathematics and not careless. They do not know that the more students who fail in a class, the more inferiority complexes are formed. Because children all have a competitive psychology of "self-expression," failing, repeating a grade, or being punished has a great impact on their psychology. They feel ashamed and humiliated even if they have some small failures.

Professor Buting said, "Children who fail in school are the backups for mental hospitals." We must pay attention to this widespread and serious problem, and try to give children more opportunities to succeed, and do not injure their enterprising and upward-looking hearts. We must make the work that children do be consistent with their actual abilities, age, and interests, and do not wantonly destroy their innocent, lively, brave, and competitive nature!

Parents and teachers should encourage and guide children to engage in learning, and should not easily scold or punish them, let alone treat them with contempt. Frequent or easy implementation of punishments does not necessarily have an educational effect. It only increases their resistant attitude of not approaching or trusting their parents or teachers. Moreover, their self-esteem is lost, and they will not work harder or be more attentive in the future, and even no matter how much they are persuaded, it will not work. We must deeply understand that blame, sarcasm, and contempt only cause children to feel frustrated, disappointed, and inferior.

An excellent parent and teacher can understand the personality and psychology of children, avoid all stimuli that can develop an inferiority complex, and often guide children to the road to success. A reasonable educational method is based on the scientific research methods of children's psychology, and trains children's adaptability with a sympathetic attitude. It educates and guides children according to the normal state of children's physical and mental development.

We should certainly try to give children more opportunities to succeed, so that they will be less likely to be hit by failure, so as not to develop an inferiority complex. But we should not let children always be in a "smooth" environment without feeling any difficulties. A person cannot completely avoid failure in his life. In some cases, failure is precisely the stimulus for success. It is very important to let children know how to work harder because of failure and to overcome difficulties by striving hard because of failure. Parents and teachers should enable children to learn in practical work based on the principle of spontaneous activity, and only be in a guiding and encouraging position, without having to do everything for them.

It is also very important to find ways to help children develop the courage to do things and learn. To prevent the occurrence of feelings of inferiority and to establish self-confidence, if parents find that their children have physical or mental defects, they should try their best to develop their strengths and make positive and reasonable compensation.

We need the embrace of a loving mother to deal with children who already have a sense of inferiority. We also need to study the causes of the inferiority complex using the diagnostic methods of doctors. Children's personalities must be respected in any way. Their fragile hearts cannot withstand the humiliation and contempt of adults. We should always think more for them. If we can maintain a sense of self-esteem for them, we should maintain a sense of self-esteem for them. I think that if adults can comfort the hearts of children and warm the hearts of children with a sympathetic, kind, sincere, and genuine attitude, then they will definitely work bravely and learn earnestly, and will never develop an inferior and cowardly mentality.

### Introducing the Nursing Profession

— Xue Lin

Our nation's victory in the War of Resistance was a comprehensive victory achieved alongside the entire Allied nations. Among the Allied nations, our country was one of the four or five major powers. We are one of the five permanent members of the United Nations. Post-war, as our international standing rises, so does our responsibility to the world. But how do we become a strong nation, and how do we fulfill our responsibilities? We should strive to study the situation in all aspects. I will now only talk about one aspect, related to my own profession. A nation's strength lies entirely in the hard work of each of its citizens. If the people are not physically healthy, how can they work hard, how can they produce? How can they invigorate their spirits to work diligently? Without a strong body, one can only consume, and there is no way to talk about production. Therefore, the progress of a nation is closely related to medicine. Strong nations must have developed medicine. Look at countries like Britain and America, and you can see the importance of medicine. Facts have already told us that we can no longer ignore it. To make the country advance, to seek happiness for mankind, we must pay attention to our issue—health. Especially after the war, those who survived endured indescribable hardships, economic bankruptcy, malnutrition, and mental trauma. How can we restore everyone to a normal state to participate in the work of reconstruction? This is the current urgent task. Governments of various countries and our government attach great importance to this issue, and there are plans to seek reforms. The newspapers have published the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's plans for medicine, which is to open 655 hospitals of various sizes, requiring a particularly large number of nursing staff. Therefore, I am here to discuss the nursing profession, so that people in the community can understand its true nature and give it their support and cooperation. The nursing profession is a social one, sacrificing oneself for the happiness of the masses. The scope of contact and work is very broad, treating people of all classes, men, women, old, young, rich, and poor, equally, providing them with the best possible care so that they can recover their health as soon as possible, and instilling them with general health knowledge so that everyone can prevent diseases and maintain health.

The nursing profession is a profession in which one must handle life's most important problems. In addition to receiving specialized training and education, nurses should have a noble character and recognize the spirit of service. Love is the main driving force of a nurse, like an atomic bomb, vast and powerful, serving others regardless of everything.

The nursing profession is a science and is advancing with the times. Various nursing techniques must apply scientific principles to ensure safe implementation and achieve appropriate or desired results. Science is advancing, and there are often new inventions. Science is the foundation of medicine and nursing. Therefore, they advance in tandem and have a very close relationship.

The nursing profession can be said to be a women's profession, because her character is gentle and considerate, which men cannot compare. Now is the time of our country's construction, and there are many places where men are needed. Isn't it good that we women can have a profession to promote our nature and fulfill our duty as citizens?

Currently, some nurses in society are not representative of the profession. On the one hand, it is because they do not have a real understanding of the nursing profession, but think of it as a way to make a living, so they do not have the spirit of service. On the other hand, it is because their general knowledge is too shallow, and they have not received adequate vocational training and education. As a result, the general public despises the nursing profession, so some young women are unwilling to choose this great profession of serving humanity. The number and quality of nurses in our country are not sufficient to meet our country's needs. I hope that this brief introduction can give the community a considerable understanding of the profession, and also arouse young women's interest in the profession, and join the nursing profession to strengthen our forces. This would allow them to make a greater contribution to our country's reconstruction, and at the same time make our country worthy of being one of the five major powers among the Allied nations.

Every morning, nurses in the nursery prepare milk according to each child's individual needs, using sterile methods, for their use throughout the day.

Seasonality

### Eliminating Bad Habits at the Start of the New Year

— Li

Soon we will encounter the Lunar New Year again. At this time, we can engage in a review. There are several bad habits that can be eliminated. We may as well remove meaningless actions and replace them with meaningful measures.

For example, because parents love their children, they give them so-called "lucky money" at the beginning of the year. After the children receive it, they either buy some nonsensical things or buy a lot of unsanitary food. We don't give them anything meaningful, such as books. If we use toys, then we should choose toys with educational significance. If we use candy, then we should choose high-quality and clean candy.

When we meet friends and relatives, we usually have to say "Congratulations on getting rich." In fact, getting rich is not the most important thing in life, and it seems that we can change to more meaningful congratulatory words.

Many superstitious actions, such as thanking the gods for the year and welcoming the god of wealth, can also be eliminated, because these actions only waste money and actually have no benefit.

The life we want to live now is a simple and clean life, no longer a hypocritical and corrupt life.

### Assisting in the Completion of the Baojia System

— Suwen

The Shanghai Municipal Government has announced that from the 15th of this month, the entire city will simultaneously reorganize the Baojia system and check the household registration. This action, as explained in the municipal government's announcement, is the basic-level organization of local self-government. Whether it is sound or not is related to the success or failure of national construction, which is extremely important.

Every one of our families should use great sincerity to assist in the completion of the Baojia system. Many people are unwilling to fill out the forms according to the real situation in order to avoid responsibility. In fact, this is unnecessary, because China is moving towards democracy. If we individuals want to get the protection of the country, we must ask ourselves what work we have done for the country. If we cooperate with the government's measures, we can get the rights we deserve.

At the same time, as a modern citizen, we can no longer adopt the attitude of "sweeping only the snow in front of our own door." We must do our best to assist in social affairs.

The Baojia system is quite related to the work of managing the family. We also hope that the government can use the Baojia system to create statistics and determine the direction of policy implementation.

For example, using the Baojia system, we can investigate how many illiterate people there are in Shanghai, and then we can start to work on how to eliminate illiteracy within the prescribed time limit.

In fact, the Baojia system can be said to be a general hub between the government and the people, so assisting in the completion of the Baojia system can be said to be the duty of everyone.

Toys

### Homemade Toys

— Xiao Shufang

Although there are many toys on the market now, the prices are quite considerable, and ordinary people cannot buy them at will. But we may as well use our spare time to sort out the leftover scraps of fabric from making clothes, and use these kinds of waste materials to make some interesting little toys, which will definitely be welcomed by children.

The method of making it is not difficult. According to the picture of the little pug (below), cut the cloth pieces to the size of the dimensions. First sew the body and the inner layer together according to the solid lines to form a cylindrical shape. Open the opening under the belly and make it hollow in the middle. Then sew the face (preferably with white cloth) and fill it with cotton (the exposed part of the face should be smooth). Sew and tie the lower end. Then attach the two ears to the head and sew them tightly in conjunction with the head (the position of the ears should be placed evenly). Sew all four legs, fill them with cotton, and then place them as shown in the picture (above). Draw the face, tie a ribbon around the neck, and finally tie a small bell on the ribbon. The whole thing is completed. It doesn't have to be made of velvet, ordinary cloth can be used.

The method of making a small dog is extremely simple and very exquisite and lovely. Children will definitely like this little toy. You may wish to try making it.

### Visiting the YWCA Nursery

— Dong Yan

If you have children who are not yet of school age, and you have to go to work every morning until dusk before you can go home, and there are no servants at home or you are not comfortable leaving them to her, then how to place your children will inevitably become the biggest problem. In the Soviet Union and in various countries in Western Europe, there are nurseries everywhere to take care of your children for you. After you finish work, you can pick them up, just paying a small fee. But in China, even in Shanghai, it is difficult to find such an ideal nursery where you can leave your children and work with peace of mind. Even if there are, the limitations of the number of places and the remoteness of the location cause many inconveniences, so we hope that nurseries will gradually increase in the future. This is a sacred service work.

It is said that there are only two nurseries with relatively large scale in the entire Shanghai. I visited the nursery at 66 Daxi Road, affiliated with the YWCA. Ms. Zhen Shanming, the clerk, sincerely answered many trivial questions for me. She said: The predecessor here was the nursery for working women, founded four years ago. Last March, due to economic reasons, it merged with the fully obligatory labor nursery. Now there are ninety-five children under their care. The oldest is seven years old, and the youngest is only ten months old. 30% of them pay a monthly fee of 7,500 yuan (including room and board), and the remaining 70%, except for a few who receive reduced fees, are completely free, and even their clothes, shoes, and socks are provided. Most of these expenses are raised by the YWCA, and recently donations have gradually decreased, and the future is uncertain. The landlord has also repeatedly urged them to move out. For these two points, Ms. Chen hopes that all parties will provide assistance.

The Relief and Rehabilitation Administration originally had flour rations, but later, because they heard that a part of them were charged, they notified them that they would stop the rations. This has had a great impact on them. Ms. Chen said that she would explain in detail to the Administration, explaining that most of them are completely free of charge. Then calculate for them that the monthly fee they receive is just enough to buy vegetables, so there is still no solution for the expenses of staff salaries, fuel, clothes, shoes, socks, water, electricity, and rent. They currently have 20 nannies and teachers, 6 servants, plus Ms. Chen and the doctor, a total of 28 staff members. Some people think there are too many, but please think carefully: If you have four children at home, an ordinary servant may not be able to cope. So it is really not too many, and to take care of the children safely and comfortably, this is not the most ideal ratio.

Afterwards, Ms. Chen led me to visit the entire nursery. The two rooms downstairs are where the children play, rest, and eat snacks. There is a large balcony in front of the window, and twenty or thirty lively and clean children are playing around at will, not shy, and call everyone "teacher" when they see them. There is also a large open space in front of the house, fenced off with wire mesh. The second and third floors are mostly children's bedrooms, with a dozen or so people sleeping in each room, with uniform short-legged small beds and white sheets. In the classroom, there are small tables and small buildings, distributed according to the size of the children. For the convenience of education and management, the children are divided into five classes. The largest class is about six or seven years old, and gradually smaller, the smallest class is ten-month-old infants, standing on the bed and crawling on the bed railings to practice their leg strength.

They have general medical equipment. If they suffer from skin diseases, they will be isolated and live separately. If they have colds and coughs, they will sleep quietly in the sanatorium. If unfortunately the illness is serious, they will be taken back by their parents, or they will be sent to the hospital, and then come back after they recover.

The children's daily life is as follows: They get up at six or seven in the morning to eat porridge. In the morning, they learn to read, tell stories, play games, and eat lunch. The lessons in the afternoon are the same as in the morning. The older class does arithmetic, eats soy milk at four o'clock, and eats noodles or steamed buns in the evening. They have to go to bed and sleep soundly at seven o'clock. They have to wash their feet once a day, and bathe once a week. Under the regulated life management, the children all grow up white and fat, energetic and energetic.

This kind of organization of nurseries is not new in our country, but there are indeed not many that are run successfully. If we want to promote women's occupations and increase family happiness, then nurseries are indispensable. Moreover, this is also extremely beneficial to the children themselves. At a young age, they are taught to learn group life and develop a lively personality, which is very important for their lives when they grow up. The new generation should be lively, endowed with a strong personality, and able to integrate into society as teenagers.
