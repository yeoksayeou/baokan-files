### Central Standing Committee of the National Defense Council Passes Resolution: Heads of Three Departments - Communications, Economy, and Publicity - to be Changed; Yu Dawei, Wang Yunwu, Peng Xuepei Appointed to New Positions; Ministry of National Defense to be Established on June 1

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 15th] The Central Standing Committee held its 30th meeting at 11:00 AM on the 15th in the State Council Conference Room.

### Yining Incident Agreement: Clauses Still Being Sorted Out

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 15th] Amidst reports that the Yining Incident is about to be resolved satisfactorily, according to a relevant person who recently flew from Dihua to Nanjing, there was a twist in the story that is worth tracing. It is said that since General Zhang Zhizhong received the order to concurrently serve as the Provincial Chairman in early April and returned to Dihua, he has been negotiating with the Yining representatives based on the agreement he was responsible for responding to in January of this year, specifically on Appendix 2 (i.e., the issue of reorganizing the troops involved in the incident), which still needed to be further discussed. However, after two months of delay, no result was achieved. The reason was that the Yining representatives insisted that the incident troops should be reorganized into at least thirteen regiments and demanded that these troops be stationed throughout Xinjiang. They also requested that the Deputy Commander of the Xinjiang Garrison be appointed by the Yining side. Zhang only agreed to consider the last point, while he only allowed a maximum of four regiments to be reorganized, leading the negotiations into a stalemate. At the beginning of this month, Zhang became anxious and uneasy, his daily life and diet were disrupted, and on May 8, he issued a letter to all compatriots in Xinjiang, clarifying the government's sincerity in seeking peace and the reasons for the prolonged negotiations. The letter pointed out that although he assumed the position of Provincial Chairman on April 8, government decrees could not be extended to the entire province, and construction work could not begin. However, he still stated that he would maintain the greatest patience to seek a peaceful resolution to the Yining Incident. On May 11, after Zhang's efforts and the mediation of the Soviet Consul, the Yining side reduced the original demand of thirteen regiments to eight regiments, and the requirement to station troops throughout Xinjiang was changed to stationing them in Dihua, Hax, and Aksu. At this point, the foundation for the agreement was finalized.

[Central News Agency, Dihua, 15th] The agreement to resolve the Yining Incident was not signed today, reportedly because the clauses are not yet complete. This afternoon, both parties had some time to discuss this, but the clauses were still not finalized by the time of the dispatch.

Pauley was unable to enter the nine northeastern provinces and the Soviet military-occupied part of Korea to carry out his investigation mission.

### Communist Army Intensifies Blockade of Jinan: Severe Coal Shortage, Food Prices Soar, Power Supply Stopped, Turning City into Dark World

[Our Jinan Correspondent, 15th] Due to the tight blockade of land and water transportation by the Communist army in the surrounding areas, the source of supplies is gradually nearing exhaustion. Currently, only vermicelli and straw can be allowed to pass through by the Communist army. Food and coal are absolutely prohibited, resulting in soaring prices in the past week, especially food prices. The threat of coal shortage is also becoming increasingly serious. The Jinan Power Company is running out of coal. The transportation of coal has been intercepted by the Communist army. With the approval of the military authorities, the power supply has been temporarily suspended since last night, and the city is dark and without light, a dark world.

[Our Jinan Correspondent, 15th] The Communist army in Shandong has recently increased its troops in Liaocheng, Zhangdian, Dezhou, and Yanzhou, but there are no major conflicts in various places. Zhangling is still occupied by the Communist army. The Jinan group will go to Linyi to meet with Chen Yi to discuss matters. The CCP has intensified its blockade of Jinan's supplies. Coal transported from Zhangdian to Jinan has been detained by the Communist army in Zaoyuansi. The price of coal and food in Jinan has soared. The coal shortage is particularly serious, with each ton rising to 200,000 yuan, which is still not easy to buy. The power company's coal storage is exhausted. Except for important institutions, power was cut off on the 14th. The Jinan group's government representative, Wen Ze, invited CCP representatives Kuang Rennong and others on the 14th to discuss matters and decided to send someone to Zaoyuansi to negotiate the release of coal.

[Another Telegram] Semi-official Soviet personnel said: "Thousands of Soviet personnel on the Changchun Railway" have either already withdrawn or will withdraw in the short term because the situation in Northeast China is unstable. It is also said that according to the Sino-Soviet Treaty, although the Changchun Railway is a joint venture between China and the Soviet Union, due to the current conflicts and "anti-Soviet sentiment," Soviet personnel are unable to take into account the rights and obligations stipulated in the treaty regarding the Changchun Railway at this time.

### Wu Guozhen Offers Farewell Remarks at the Capital Journalists' Association: Government and the Press Should Trust and Cooperate Seamlessly

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 15th] The new Mayor of Shanghai, Wu Guozhen, provided three key points of advice at a farewell dinner at the Capital Journalists' Association at 7:00 PM on the 15th: (1) With our joint efforts, the freedom of the press that the world needs can be said to have reached 99%. This is a beautiful result of mutual encouragement and assistance between the government and the press, and we should cherish it. (2) The development of China's press symbolizes a bright future for the country, but in terms of the entire country, it is hoped that those who are dedicated to the press will pay more attention to and promote journalism in provinces and regions lacking newspapers. Take New York as an example. The population of New York State is as high as 12 million, and the population within New York City is 6 million. However, there are only seven newspapers in New York. Even in the developed press of the United Kingdom, the number of newspapers in London is not much larger. If we hope that China's press will develop normally, we should take this as a lesson. (3) "Freedom of the press" and "democratic politics" are treasures of civilized countries and essential conditions for establishing modern countries. We will have both. The responsibility of the press in the future is extremely important and great. It is hoped that the government and the press will trust and help each other and cooperate seamlessly to promote political progress. Finally, Wu said that in the future, the government should trust reporters and inform the press of its achievements and difficulties at any time to provide the public with faithful reports. At the same time, he hoped that the press would trust the government and carefully consider its choices in selecting news to facilitate interviews. After the speech, everyone happily dined together and dispersed around 8:00 PM.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 15th] It is reported that the new Mayor of Shanghai, Wu Guozhen, will go to Shanghai after handing over his affairs as Minister of Propaganda on the 21st of this month.

### Marshall Arrives in Shanghai from Nanjing for a Private Visit at the Invitation of Madame Chiang

[Our Newspaper Report] Marshal Marshall, the U.S. Special Envoy to China, has been extremely diligent in presiding over the Kuomintang-Communist mediation efforts for the past few months. Yesterday at 11:20 AM, he arrived in Shanghai by special plane, accompanied by Lieutenant General Gillem, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Forces in China, and others. It is reported that Marshal Marshall's visit is purely at the invitation of Madame Chiang Kai-shek, in the capacity of a private guest for a visit. Therefore, neither the municipal authorities nor the U.S. military headquarters personnel were fully informed in advance. Those who welcomed him at Jiangwan Airport were only General Matthews, Chief of Staff of the U.S. Forces, General Eaker, Commander of the Air Force, and a few others. At Madame Chiang's request, Marshal Marshall and his wife will be staying at the Chairman's residence on Dongping Road for a short period. He will return to Nanjing in the next few days and will decline all meetings and social engagements.

### Supreme Court Upholds Original Verdict: Traitor Chen Gongbo Cannot Escape Death; Traitor Li Shengwu Prosecuted by the Capital High Court

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] After the Jiangsu High Court sentenced the arch-traitor Chen Gongbo to death on April 12th, the case was submitted to the Supreme Court for review. On the 14th, the Supreme Court announced the result of the review, with the main text stating, "The original verdict is approved." The Supreme Court also approved the death sentence in the case of traitor Miao Bin on May 3rd. Thus, the death sentences of the two traitors have been finalized and are awaiting execution.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] Li Shengwu, the puppet Minister of Education, has been prosecuted by the Capital High Court after being transferred there and repeatedly investigated by the prosecutor in accordance with the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors. The indictment is summarized as follows: Facts of the crime: The defendant, Li Shengwu, is a member of the Kuomintang, and has served as a specialist member of the Central Political Committee, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Counselor of the Executive Yuan. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, he moved to Hong Kong with the Commercial Press, serving as the chief editor of the press and a member of the National Political Council. When Wang Jingwei issued his infamous telegram and was persuaded by him, he went to Shanghai in the 28th year of the Republic to serve as a member of the Puppet Central Executive Committee and a standing committee member, as well as a member of the Puppet Central Political Committee. In March of the following year, the puppet government was established under the protection of the Japanese invaders, and the defendant was appointed as the Puppet Minister of Judicial Administration. In the spring of the 30th year, Chu Minyi, the Puppet Minister of Foreign Affairs, was transferred to serve as the Puppet Governor of Guangdong Province, and the defendant concurrently served as the head of that ministry until he resigned after the Japanese invaders surrendered last year. The defendant was captured by the Military Commission's Bureau of Investigation and Statistics and sent to the court for investigation. It is found that although the defendant Li Shengwu repeatedly defended himself during the investigation, it is found that (1) If the defendant opposed Wang Jingwei's betrayal of the central government and the establishment of another government, why would he accept his invitation to go from Hong Kong to Shanghai? Moreover, it is not uncommon for Jiang's confidants to refuse to participate in the puppet organization. Now, claiming that there would be a danger to his life if he did not hold a puppet position, its untruthfulness can be generally seen. Moreover, the defendant has held a puppet position for more than five years, during which time there was no lack of opportunities to avoid it, which is sufficient to show that the claim is a decoration. (2) It is known to all enlightened people that the Japanese invaders have been plotting to destroy our country day and night for decades. The puppet National Government was created by the Japanese invaders because they were unable to control the occupied areas, and they had no choice but to create this puppet organization to drive and spur them on, in order to achieve their goal of consolidating the occupied areas, so as to facilitate a full-scale attack on our central government. Although the defendant cunningly claimed that according to international law during wartime, the occupied areas are temporarily occupied by the enemy, not ceded, and the preservation of the culture of the occupied areas should be the responsibility of our own people, it is not known that the defendant held an important puppet position in the puppet National Government, followed the instructions of the Japanese invaders, and promoted anesthetic youth enslavement education. How can it be said that it is preserving culture? (3) After Wang organized the puppet National Government, he plundered resources, blocked rural areas, recruited bandits, issued puppet currency, publicly sold opium, and enslaved young people in the occupied areas. Almost none of these were not harmful to the country and the people. The defendant successively headed the departments of justice, administration, education, and foreign affairs, promoted his government decrees, and helped him commit his crimes. However, he still lavishly talked about preserving the national vitality and the Three People's Principles of resistance war education. In view of the facts, it is just the opposite. As for not participating in important meetings of the puppet party, it is found that the defendant was a standing member of the puppet Central Executive Committee and a member of the puppet Political Conference, and he has served as a puppet minister for many years. Who would believe that he did not participate in important meetings of the puppet party? In summary, none of the defenses are false and cunning, and they are not worthy of adoption. His behavior is a violation of the first item of the second article of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors. Therefore, a public prosecution is filed in accordance with Article 1 of the Special Criminal Cases Procedure Law and Article 230, Paragraph 1, of the Criminal Procedure Law.

### Qi Xieyuan and Others Transferred to Military Law Office; Dong Kang, a Traitor, Indicted

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 14th] The third batch of military traitors, Qi Xieyuan, Shao Wenkai, Huang Nanpeng, Zhao Jinshan, Ye Hua, Wang Bin, and 17 others, have been investigated by the military organs here, and it has been decided to transfer them to the military law office of the headquarters on the morning of the 15th.

[Another Telegram] The prosecutor of the Hebei High Court has filed a public prosecution against Dong Kang, a major judicial traitor in North China. The main points of his indictment are (1) After the enemy invaded and occupied North China, he cooperated with Wang Kemin and others, participated in the puppet North China Political Affairs Committee, and served as the chairman of the Judicial Committee. Although he has changed his position since then, he has served in puppet positions for eight years. (2) Conspiring with the enemy and betraying the motherland is a clear fact. (3) The defendant claims to have been induced by Tang Erhe, but how could he have been induced by him every day for eight years? (4) The defendant claims to be 80 years old, but according to the annual calculation, he was born on the 22nd day of the Yin month of the Dingmao year of the Tongzhi reign, so he is not yet 80 years old. (5) The defendant is highly suspected of violating Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1, of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors. A public prosecution is filed in accordance with Article 230, Paragraph 1, of the Special Criminal Cases Procedure Law.

### Former Corrupt Puppet Officials in Shanghai Sentenced for Treason

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 15th] The major corruption case of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Consumption Special Tax Bureau, which once shocked the whole country, involved more than 30 officials. At that time, it was investigated by the puppet Nanjing Higher Court, and they were sentenced to two years and six months in prison. Before they had served one year, the Anti-Japanese War was won. After the restoration of the judicial system in Nanjing, the prisoners in the case were released without continuing their sentences at their request. Later, on suspicion of being traitors, Guo Shaoji, the puppet section chief in the case, and Xu Gui, Wu Songlin, Zhu Junqing, Wang Beishui, Zhu Lianming, Chen Kaiyuan, Shi Renji, Zhu Hanjie, Hua Guozhong, Shen Jingmao, Qin Zhongyi, Zhou Guangyao, He Bailin, and Lin Jianxiang, were arrested and transferred to the Suzhou High Court Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution.

[Central News Agency, Our City] General Sun Liren, commander of the New Army, previously attended the United Nations Military Staff Committee meeting in the United States with General Wen Zhen, and jointly discussed and drafted the International Security Force plan with military staff members of the Allied countries. He completed his public duties and arrived in Tokyo from the United States by plane on the 13th. Yesterday at 12:00 noon, he departed from Tokyo on an A.T.C. No. 5511 special plane and returned to China, arriving in Shanghai at 3:55 PM. The welcomers at Jiangwan Airport included Shen Shihua, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, Jiang Zhuyi, Secretary-General of the National Diplomacy Association, Colonel Cullen of the U.S. Military Headquarters, and many of Sun's friends. Sun wore an army uniform, high boots, and the "New First Army" designation on his shoulder, with the U.S. Army Medal on the corner of his upper pocket, and a light yellow overcoat in his hand. He looked radiant. The reporter first asked Sun about his impressions of attending the United Nations Military Staff Committee meeting and the drafting process of the International Security Force plan. He smiled and replied: "I am a soldier, and I am unwilling to express too much until the time for publication." The reporter then asked about the New First Army's garrison plan and whether Sun planned to go to the Northeast. Sun also smiled and did not give a definite answer. Finally, Sun stated that he was very grateful for the convenience provided by the U.S. military along the way on his return to China. He arrived in Tokyo on the 13th and met with MacArthur. He was originally scheduled to depart for China on the 14th, but was delayed by one day due to a plane malfunction, so he was able to attend the International Military Tribunal's observation of the Japanese war criminal Kiyose. Tokyo is currently experiencing a shortage of food, and prices are rising, but order is still good due to encouragement and restraint. After Sun finished speaking, he took a car to his residence at the Broadway Mansion for rest. It is reported that Sun will stay in Shanghai for a short time before going to Nanjing to report to the highest authorities.

### Representatives of the Democratic League and the Political Consultative Conference Invite Newspaper Reporters

[Our Newspaper Report] Huang Yanpei, Liang Shuming, Zhang Bojun, Zhang Junmai, and other representatives of the Democratic League to the Shanghai Political Consultative Conference, invited newspaper reporters yesterday afternoon. However, Zhang Junmai was not present temporarily. Chairman Huang Yanpei, Liang, Zhang, and others spoke successively and answered the questions raised by the reporters. The event lasted for one hour. The main idea was that the purpose of the Democratic League is to unite the whole country and hope to realize democratic politics. Its primary task is to strive for peace. This effort has never been slackened. The four of them have four appeals regarding the current situation: (1) Compatriots from all walks of life across the country should unite to stop the civil war and save the critical situation. (2) In accordance with the words announced in the Kuomintang-Communist negotiations record of the Double Tenth Festival last year, it is recognized that the civil war is a violation of their original intentions. (3) The authorities on both sides should voluntarily make greater concessions, jointly respect the implementation of the ceasefire order of the Military Mediation Department, and a ceasefire order should be implemented uniformly throughout the country. (4) Reopen the consultative conference to resolve the unfinished issues of the previous time, and urge the implementation of various agreements, and embark on the road of peaceful nation-building that was paved a hundred days ago.

Short Commentary

### Further Explanation of the Four Appeals

Huang Yanpei, Liang Shuming, Zhang Bojun, and other representatives of the Democratic League at the Political Consultative Conference, hosted reporters in Shanghai yesterday, and reported that they had made an appeal with regard to the current situation: (1) We request all compatriots across the country to unite to stop the civil war; (2) We request the Kuomintang and the Communist Party not to make the mistake of civil war; (3) We urge that the ceasefire order in the Northeast and other places be thoroughly implemented; (4) Reopen the Consultative Conference. The good intentions of appeasement are worthy of our admiration. However, we would like to give the representatives of the Democratic League a further explanation.

"Civil war" is hated by everyone, the ceasefire is an order that the government and the Communist Party have long issued, and consultation is a work that the representatives of the Democratic League personally participated in. At that time, there seemed to be an agreement, so why do we still have to trouble everyone to appeal today? We want to ask everyone: Which side provoked the "civil war"? Which side first violated the ceasefire order? At the Consultative Conference, it was agreed that the Northeast would be taken over by the National Government and was not within the scope of military mediation. Which side is the first to not implement the agreement and insists on using troops to seize Changchun? In addition, which troops are attacking cities and destroying railways everywhere in the interior? Since the representatives of the Democratic League are compassionate and appeal for peace, I wonder what their feelings are about the troublemakers who are determined to undermine peace? Everyone is urging both sides to make concessions. Can they guarantee that the central government will continue to make concessions, and will the Communist Party be able to achieve true peace from then on? If you don't ask right and wrong, then after the robbery, should you also call on the robbed and the robber to make concessions to be fair and worthy of appeasement?

Forget it! Please don't forget that you are also the masters of the country and participants in the consultation. Troublemakers simply look down on you and don't take the agreements you have participated in seriously. Not only can you do nothing about it, but you still have to follow them and shout "ceasefire" after they have occupied some territory!

To be honest, just appealing is not useful. You must have your eyes open to see clearly which side is violating the ceasefire order, and then use your power to punish those who violate the ceasefire order to truly stop the civil war. The representatives of the Democratic League ask themselves: Where are your eyes? Where is your power?

Wuxi

Large Numbers of Black Insects Found in Wheat Fields In Zhangjing Bridge, Hongsheng Town, Nanmiao Lane, Nanmen, and other places in this county, large numbers of black insects have been found in wheat fields. When first born, they are only a little over a fen [unit of length, approx. 1/3 cm] long, but within a week, they are almost identical to silkworms in shape. Their bodies are covered in black hairs, and they crawl on the wheat stalks, chewing on the leaves. They are everywhere within a fifty-li [unit of distance, approx. 50 km] radius, which is alarming. In recent days, there are no intact wheat leaves, and they have already started eating the wheat ears. This is enough to form a disastrous famine. At the same time, they have also been found in Xinzhuang on the border of Cheng and Yu, and in Houtai, Dafang Bridge, Jian'an Bridge, and other places in this county. It is predicted that this summer's harvest will be at most two dou [unit of volume, approx. 20 liters] per mu [unit of area, approx. 1/15 hectare], and the farmers are all lamenting their suffering to the heavens.

More than 100 stores and more than 20 large households in the entire town were not spared. The loss exceeded 20 million yuan. The town office's self-defense light machine gun, three wooden-cased rifles, and ten rifles were also seized. After the robbery, they retreated in formation to Zhoujiawei. On the 11th, Jiang, chairman of the Hushao Bridge Town Chamber of Commerce, reported to the county. The county government dispatched the Second Company and the Independent Company to suppress them, but unexpectedly, on the night of the 12th, the mutinying soldiers again ransacked Xinmiao Town, about five li northeast of Xincang Town, losing more than ten million yuan. After the robbery, they retreated towards the border of Jinshan County. In order to eliminate future troubles, the county government telegraphed the province for permission to dispatch the Youth Army to the county and jointly suppress them with the Jinshan County government. It is predicted that they will be annihilated soon.

Municipal Hospital Reopens

The outpatient department is scheduled to open on June 1. In addition to 100 new American-style hospital beds, the hospital also has dental equipment, X-ray examination equipment, microscopes, blood microscopes, sterilizers, new-style surgical and obstetrical instruments, and hospital vehicles.

The inpatient department will open after preparations are complete.

Material Distribution for Public Educators and Civil Servants The Zhejiang Provincial Cooperative Enterprise Management Office recently received instructions from Chairman Shen to actively promote consumer cooperatives for public educators, civil servants, and workers in the provincial capital. The board of directors of the consumer cooperative for employees of provincial capital agencies has been reorganized and will be responsible for the distribution of materials to public educators and civil servants in the provincial capital.

This month, the quota distribution of edible oil, cloth, matches, and soap will be added. However, the cooperative's capital is currently too thin, and the Cooperative Supply and Marketing Office is preparing a plan to submit to the chairman for financial assistance. As for worker consumer cooperatives, the General Labor Union has been mobilized to organize them.

Editorial

### The Unification and Division of India

According to news from Shimla, the roundtable conference attempting to resolve the Indian situation has failed because the Congress Party and the Muslim League could not reach an agreement. The British and Indian sides will issue a formal document today (the 16th). This document will touch upon the issue of Indian independence. It seems that the British cabinet delegation to India has revealed its intention to abandon its rule over India. Therefore, before leaving Shimla for New Delhi, Gandhi urged Indians to prepare to fight for freedom. Another report said that Indian Governor Wavell is considering establishing an interim government as soon as possible, and establishing a constitutional institution with the support of all the people. Since this news came out, the Indian situation has once again become the concern of the world. According to various indications, how the British government will attempt to break the deadlock in India after the end of the three-party roundtable conference, and seek another way to resolve it, remains to be seen in the British government's official announcement. But the reason why the Indian situation is difficult to reach an agreement, and how the future Indian situation will unfold, we, as a friendly neighbor, would like to express our views.

First of all, what we want to say is that although China and India are friendly neighbors with historical friendship, the understanding of the current situation of each other between the Chinese and Indian nations is really not enough. India is an extremely complex place, and what we know is really limited. China's understanding of India is closely linked to the introduction of Buddhism. Some people think that India is still a Buddhist country today, but they do not know that after traveling through India, it is impossible to find a follower of Sakyamuni today. Our understanding of India is too insufficient. Although the Chinese and Indian nations are both ancient civilizations in Asia, the historical development of these two nations is completely different. China is a nation with a strong sense of history, while India can be said to have no sense of history at all. China has the treasure house of the Twenty-Four Histories, while the historical records of India are almost entirely dependent on foreign countries, especially China. China is a geographical unit, and it completed political unification as early as two thousand years ago, while India has never been unified since its history until now. At present, there is British India, French India, Portuguese India, and native emperors under British protection. The Maurya Dynasty can be said to be a "great unification" situation of pure Indians, but its power does not extend to the south of India. Emperor Akbar of the Mughal Empire came from Central Asia outside India and devoted himself to the unification of India, but he also died with his ambition, and his long-cherished wish was not fulfilled. Since the beginning of history, there has never been a unified India! This is the historical destiny of the Indian people!

Since the Indian people had a national awakening, under the leadership of Gandhi and Nehru, they actively launched the national liberation movement, and the Indian people have yearned for the establishment of a modern, independent, and unified India. The unfolding of this movement has also prompted the awakening of the Muslim people; in order to protect the interests of the Muslim people, they have also launched their political actions under the banner of the "Muslim League" and under the call of "Pakistan"? Because of the accumulation of historical reasons, the residents of northwest and northern India, and even Bengal and Assam in the east, are almost entirely or mostly Muslim people. Although they and the Hindus are both in India, the differences in language, religion, and living habits make them seem like two different nations. Indians have an extremely strong concept of class, and there are lowly untouchable classes, while Muslims have no distinction between rich and poor, and all worship in the same mosque. Indians regard cows as sacred and inviolable, while Muslims often use beef as food. With these various differences, where Indians and Muslims live together, often minor incidents lead to major changes. For example, if a Muslim throws beef on the land where Indians live, the Indians think it is blasphemy, and they will definitely start a major fight with the Muslims; similarly, if an Indian throws pork on the land where Muslims live, it will also lead to equal consequences. The hatred between Indians and Muslims is extremely deep, and it does seem difficult to cooperate. The failure of this three-party conference is due to the fact that the Congress Party represented by Gandhi and Nehru advocated that India should establish a unified India under the leadership of Hindus, while the Muslim League represented by Jinnah insisted on the separation of India and Muslims, and the Muslim people must establish their

Standing on the standpoint of the Chinese National Revolution, we certainly hope that a unified and independent India can emerge. But if we objectively examine the Indian situation, if Britain withdraws from India and establishes an independent and unified India under the leadership of the Indians represented by the Congress Party, it will inevitably lead to the opposition of more than one-third of the Muslim people in India, and make India, Asia, and even the entire world unstable. The different ideas between the Indian and Muslim people are too deep, and no one can simultaneously play the role of leading the Indian and Muslim people. In the two thousand years since the Maurya Dynasty, the Indian people have often been ruled by foreign ethnic groups; in these two thousand years, foreign populations and foreign religions and other historical factors have established an unshakable foundation in the northwest, north, and east of India. We cannot ignore this point. Here, we want to particularly state that our country also has a Muslim population that is not small, but the Muslim problem in India is fundamentally different from the Muslim population in China. The Chinese people who believe in Islam are constituent members of the Chinese nation, and they are completely integrated with the non-Muslim Chinese people in terms of history and culture. This is not comparable to the Indian Muslim independence movement. The backgrounds are different, and they cannot be regarded as the same. The Chinese nation is one, but India is not like this.

The independence of India is an extremely arduous task. Currently, the Labour Party is in power in Britain. The Labour Party's policy towards India has always been more enlightened than the Conservative Party led by Churchill. The British government led by Attlee sent a cabinet delegation to India to promote the independence of India and conducted negotiations with the Congress Party and the Muslim League. We are naturally very pleased with this wise move by the British government. Now that the three-party conference has failed, it goes without saying that the British government will continue to work hard to find a solution. A divided India will of course easily lead to future dangers; but a unified India also has the current realistic obstacles. How to reconcile the respective wishes of the Indian and Muslim people, so that the ideals of both sides can be realized without harming the external unity of India, is hoped to be achieved through the forbearance of the leaders of both sides, and especially through the wise mediation of a third party. An unstable India is closely related to China's security. We hope that the people of the three parties can use their wisdom to break the current deadlock.

### Differing Opinions Difficult to Eliminate Foreign Ministers' Conference Ends Within the Week US Proposes to Reopen on the 15th of Next Month Discussion of German Issues Yesterday, Soviet Union Opposes Our Participation

[This Newspaper Report] San Francisco, 15th Broadcast: The four-power foreign ministers' conference, which has been meeting for three weeks, is now coming to an end and should be over by the end of this week. The foreign ministers are scheduled to discuss the German issue today in an attempt to reach an agreement so that the conference will not be a complete failure. The British and American delegations will state that although the talks have reached a stalemate, they have not been completely fruitless. At the same time, thanks to the frank discussions of the four foreign ministers, agreements have been reached on a number of minor issues.

[This Newspaper Report] London, 15th Broadcast: This morning, the four foreign ministers held an informal meeting in Paris to discuss the German issue. Bevin suggested that each foreign minister appoint a special representative to study the entire German issue and try to draft a peace treaty to be submitted to the peace conference, which will be held on November 12. Bevin also suggested that the representatives should review the relevant issues related to Germany at the next meeting. The French foreign minister proposed to promote the internationalization of the Ruhr and Rhineland regions, pointing out that the separation of these two regions from Germany is the best way to prevent Germany from aggressing again.

[United Press Paris 14th Dispatch] US Secretary of State Byrnes revealed today that China has sent a memorandum to the four foreign ministers, requesting that in accordance with the decisions made at the Potsdam Conference, when the discussion of the German issue begins (which will likely be held on the 15th), a representative be allowed to attend the meeting. Byrnes, Bevin, and Bidault all agreed, but Molotov objected. Molotov said that the current meeting is only a preliminary consultation and should be limited to the occupying countries. (Note: According to the Central News Agency London 14th Dispatch, the BBC's news broadcast said that our country has been invited to participate.)

[Central News Agency Paris 14th Dispatch] US Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the American-occupied zone of Germany, Lieutenant General Clay, and political advisor Murphy have arrived in Paris to participate in the four foreign ministers' conference regarding the discussion of the German issue. Clay and Murphy participated in this morning's foreign ministers' meeting.

[French News Agency Paris 14th Dispatch] The four foreign ministers held a meeting today. US Secretary of State Byrnes, in an effort to save the conference from complete failure, suggested that the meeting be adjourned immediately after the discussion of the German issue and reopened on June 15. At the same time, the four deputy foreign ministers should continue to meet and try to eliminate various differences so that the four foreign ministers can easily compromise with each other when they reopen the meeting next month. Byrnes also put forward three suggestions as follows: (1) Immediately decide to convene a 21-nation peace conference, with the opening date set for July 1 or July 15. If an agreement cannot be reached on this, the opening date of the peace conference will be decided by the four foreign ministers at their next meeting; (2) Immediately revise the armistice agreement with Italy; (3) The draft peace treaty with Austria can be placed on the agenda of the foreign ministers' meeting on June 15, and the other issues to be discussed at that time should be agreed upon by the deputy foreign ministers of each country. The British and French foreign ministers expressed their agreement in principle to these suggestions, but they jointly requested the Soviet foreign minister to consider them at length. The foreign ministers' meeting today decided to refer the issue of the disposal of Italian colonies and the issue of the border between Italy and Greece to the deputy foreign ministers' meeting for discussion.

[United Press Paris 15th Dispatch] People close to the Soviet delegation predicted today that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov will agree to the US proposal to convene a 21-nation peace conference in July after the four foreign ministers meet again next month. US Secretary of State Byrnes' suggestion has four items in total, and Molotov is expected to agree to three of them, but he is determined not to include the Austrian peace treaty on the agenda of the four foreign ministers' meeting on June 15. Judging from the situation, the current meeting may end its work on the 16th, but a basic agreement on the peace treaty has not yet been reached. It is said that President Truman's special plane has already set off for Paris to pick up the US representatives to return to Washington.

[Reuters London 15th Dispatch] British Prime Minister Attlee told the House of Commons yesterday that I will be able to issue a document on India before the end of this week. Opposition leader Churchill asked the Prime Minister whether, for the sake of convenience, a motion to adjourn could be moved when the document is issued, so that questions and comments could be raised in accordance with the procedure. According to the procedure, if a motion to adjourn is not moved, the opposition party can only raise questions in the House of Commons. Attlee seemed to tacitly approve this request, but everyone opposed it. Conservative figures now expect Churchill to be waiting for this opportunity to attack the domestic policy of the British government again. The Conservative Party is also waiting for Churchill to return to the House of Commons to lead the matter, but the direction of the attack is still unknown.

Franco-Siamese Negotiations Underway

[United Press, Washington, 15th] - Government officials announced today that the United States and the United Kingdom have made a "suggestion" to France that French forces in Vietnam should not invade Siamese territory. It is reported that a week ago, French forces fired machine guns and rifles across the Mekong River at the Siamese town of Makong Phanom, causing considerable damage to the town's houses. Allegedly, the Siamese residents refused to hand over Annamese people who had fled there, leading to the French attack. These Annamese people oppose Vietnam remaining under French rule after the war.

This was the report obtained by government representatives and British and American observers after investigating the area. He expressed deep regret over the matter and stated that negotiations have begun.

[United Press, Tokyo, 15th] - The Far East International Military Tribunal adjourned today after abruptly interrupting the defense counsel's complaints, announcing that the trial was suspended indefinitely. At the hearing today, American legal counsel Clement, representing five Japanese defendants including former Prime Minister Kiichiro Hiranuma, again accused the eleven judges of lacking the qualifications to judge the various charges in the indictment. He also stated that international law does not stipulate the various charges in the indictment. The defense also requested the prosecution to clearly state the charges, locations, and circumstances of the alleged conspiracy to launch a war of aggression and other crimes. Clement also declared that it was inappropriate for the defendants to be tried as "ordinary murderers." The complaint also demanded a list of all witnesses and the names of witnesses interviewed by the prosecution, as well as all physical evidence for the 55 charges upon which the indictment was based. British Assistant Prosecutor Karr opposed the defense counsel's request, stating that the requested information had already been announced. Chief Justice Webb also stated that Clement's arguments were not very helpful. The court then temporarily adjourned for private deliberation, and soon after, the bailiff announced an indefinite suspension of the trial.

### Allied Council for Japan: Soviet Representative Raises Questions

[United Press, Tokyo, 15th] - At today's meeting of the Four-Power Allied Council for Japan, Soviet representative Telefyanko proposed that the Supreme Commander of the United Nations should include draft directives for the implementation of the occupation in the Council's agenda. American representative Atcheson, the chairman of the committee, immediately replied that pre-discussion by the council of important directives proposed by the Supreme Commander to the Japanese government would impede the occupation and would be unreasonable. Such a procedure would transform the Control Council into a negotiating body for the four interested countries. The authority of the committee is nothing more than to provide opinions and assist in the implementation of policies already negotiated between the governments. However, the Supreme Commander can notify the Control Council 48 hours before issuing the directive. The Soviet representative also raised the issue of the repatriation of Japanese soldiers and the possible secret activities of retired Japanese officers. A spokesman for the Supreme Commander replied that 226,599 Japanese army and navy officers had been repatriated. So far, under close surveillance, there is little evidence to suggest that Japanese officers are attempting to engage in underground activities.

### British Troops to Withdraw from Cairo and Alexandria Before End of July; Britain and Egypt Are Currently Discussing Completing the Deadline for the Withdrawal of Troops; Canal Defense Plan Will Be a Thorny Issue

[Reuters, Cairo, 15th] - This question has received orders from senior British authorities, instructing British troops in Cairo and Alexandria to withdraw before the end of July. At the same time, according to authoritative sources, Britain estimates that the value of military equipment in Egypt is about £160 million, and intends to transfer it to Egypt, but the Egyptian side said that the value of this equipment is at most only half of it, or £80 million. This is also one of the problems facing the representatives of the amendment negotiations. Although British troops in Cairo and Alexandria have been ordered to withdraw before the end of July, the question of when all British troops in Egypt can withdraw remains. Egypt believes that the withdrawal of troops cannot be delayed until after one year, while the British side said that it will take two years to complete the withdrawal. Some representatives even said that it would take five years. The date of complete withdrawal is the main agenda of the negotiations, and it is reported that the two sides have agreed that British experts will accompany the Egyptian military advisory group to inspect the British military facilities to determine a reasonable deadline for the completion of the withdrawal of troops. There are many other issues that need to be discussed, such as how Egypt can protect British interests in Egypt in the event of war or a threat of war, and the defense plan of the Suez Canal. The latter issue is particularly thorny. Britain regards the canal as the lifeline of the empire, so Britain should participate in the defense. However, Egypt believes that Egypt's defense performance in the last war was very good, so there is no need for the British to worry. The Egyptians are determined not to jointly defend Egypt with other countries. The Sudan issue will be discussed at the end of the meeting.

One of the Three Old Men of the Sea

### Yuan Ludeng's Public Trial Yesterday Morning; Speaking Fluent Shanghai-ized Ningbo Dialect, He Claimed: "Household Rice" Rationing Was Unreliable, Insisting on Resignation; Feigning Illness at a Sanitarium to Gain "Approval"

[Special Report] Yuan Ludeng, who, during the enemy puppet period, was known as one of the "Three Old Men" of Shanghai, along with Wen Lanting and Lin Kanghou, was first investigated yesterday morning at 8:40 AM by Xiao Luo Changfen of the High Court's Second Special Criminal Tribunal. The defendant retained three lawyers, Chen Tingrui, Li Baosen, and Chao Jimei, as defense counsel, who claimed that the points in the indictment were contrary to the actual situation; his assumption of puppet positions was entirely for the benefit of the people and not at all a collaboration with the enemy. After Presiding Judge Xiao inquired about each point in the indictment, he announced that the hearing would be rescheduled. Because the hearing yesterday morning was not publicly announced beforehand, only a few people were present in the audience; not many of Yuan's family members attended either. Yuan did not request to see his family; only defense lawyer Chen Tingrui spoke with the defendant for three minutes after the court adjourned.

Yuan is from Ningbo, 68 years old, and lives at 4, Alley 16, Beile Road. He originally served as a Chinese director of the Shanghai Former International Settlement. After the fall, he continued to serve as a Chinese director of the Public Works Department. In July of the 31st year [of the Republic, i.e., 1942], he also served concurrently as the Chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce; in September, he also served concurrently as the Chairman of the Rice and Grain Control Committee of the Puppet Executive Yuan and as a member of the Nanjing Puppet Materials Review Committee, purchasing rice and grain on behalf of the enemy. In February of the 32nd year, Shanghai was bombed by our planes, and the enemy was uneasy, dividing the central area into six major districts and implementing a blockade policy. The defendant even organized the Baojia system on behalf of the enemy, serving as the Chairman of the Baojia Preparatory Committee, responsible for the preparations; the task was completed in June and handed over to the Baojia Section of the Puppet Police Department, which conducted household registration checks. In the winter of the same year, Shao Shijun organized the Dahua Bank, and the defendant served as the General Manager of the bank, as well as serving concurrently as a member of the Puppet New National Movement Committee and other positions. After the victory, he was arrested and prosecuted by the court.

Yesterday morning, the defendant wore a half-old purplish-bronze small floral silk robe, white socks, and black shoes, with black-rimmed reading glasses on his nose and a shaved head with white hair, but his demeanor was calm, and his spirits were still good. When answering questions, he spoke fluent Shanghai-ized Ningbo dialect, often with a smile. After Presiding Judge Xiao asked the defendant about his age and origin, he immediately asked what property he had. He replied that most of his property was stocks and that he had submitted a list to the Military Intelligence Bureau; as for the house he lived in, it was rented. He asked, "Who else is in your family?" He replied, "Both my parents are dead. I have one wife, one son who is married and 33 years old, and three grandsons and one granddaughter; the oldest is fifteen years old, and the youngest is only seven years old." Yuan then stated that the indictment written by the prosecutor did not match the defendant's actions because his

assumption of puppet positions was entirely for the benefit of the people and not at all a collaboration with the enemy. Before the incident, in addition to his own business, he had co-founded the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association with Yu Zhiqing and served as a Chinese director of the Public Works Department for more than ten consecutive years. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, all Chinese and Western directors were falsely accused of corruption. In the first half of the 30th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1941], the puppet government wanted to reorganize the Public Works Department, and all four Chinese directors wanted to resign. Three of them went to Hong Kong, and only he was forced to remain by the Japanese. In the second half of the 31st year, the British and American directors were all imprisoned in concentration camps, and he remained in his position until the recovery of the concessions. In July of the 31st year, the Shanghai trade associations petitioned the puppet government to reorganize the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and unanimously recommended him as chairman. After the expiration of his term in the 33rd year, he was still unanimously recommended for reappointment, until November of last year. In September of the 33rd year, Zhou Fohai, the Premier of the Puppet Executive Yuan, appointed him as the chairman of the affiliated Rice and Grain Control Committee, and he raised

two conditions: (1) Increase the purchase price of rice and grain to benefit farmers; (2) Guarantee the rationing of household rice. Zhou said, "As long as you come out, it will not be a problem," so he took the position. The committee had two deputy directors and seven or eight members, overseeing: (1) District A, including twelve counties in Jiangsu and three counties in Zhejiang; (2) District B: northern Jiangsu and Anhui. However, the purchase of rice and grain was handled by the Japanese army. As for the purchase price, it was handled only after being approved by the Japanese army. He had raised the purchase price from two hundred yuan per dan to eight hundred and twenty yuan. Later, due to the excessive rise in prices, the household rice could not continue to be rationed, so he insisted on resigning without success. Later, he feigned illness at the Hongqiao Sanitarium and was finally approved. He also said, "If I had intended to be a traitor, I could have used my power to make a fortune; but I am still very poor. My procurement of rice and grain was entirely to fulfill my obligation, and all public funds were returned to the puppet government, treating it as refugee relief work." It was done for a total of eight months, and the first three months went well, but later

it gradually declined. By the last two months, the rationing of rice was unreliable, which really saddened me, so I had to pretend to be sick and resign." At the same time, he denied attending the Materials Review Committee meeting on November 3 of the 33rd year and serving as the chairman of the joint meeting of the Rice Control Committee on October 13 of the same year. The presiding judge asked, "Were there any Japanese on the Rice Control Committee?" He replied, "There were four or five Japanese members, all representatives of Japanese trading companies such as Mitsubishi, Mitsui, and Dahua." He asked, "On September 15 of the 32nd year, the newspaper reported that the committee made a statement saying that the Rice Control Committee's purchase of grain had to "trouble our friendly nations for assistance," is that correct?" He replied, "No, no." He asked, "On October 11 of the 32nd year, the Rice and Grain Procurement Trade Union held a preparatory meeting, and you gave a speech?" He replied, "No, no." He asked, "On May 7 of the 33rd year, did you go to Nanjing to report on the procurement of grain?" He replied, "I went to resign." He asked, "Are you also a member of the National Diplomacy Promotion Committee?" He replied, "This is a tangential matter, and the purpose is still to seek local interests." He asked, "You made many 'Greater East Asia' remarks?" He replied, "I still have my thoughts. As chairman, I can only speak for one or two minutes at most and have never delivered

lengthy speeches. What is published in the newspapers is all fabricated by others, and there was no way to correct it at the time." He asked, "Many prominent people left Shanghai at that time, why did you stay in Shanghai?" He replied, "I myself had to stay in Shanghai to support friends, relatives, and charitable organizations, but I advised Xi Yushu and Xu Jixun to leave Shanghai. Du Yuesheng, Wu Kaixian, and He Dekui all know this." As for the matter of being a sponsoring member of the Puppet Air Force Movement Committee, he claimed that he had never been to the airport. At this point, Yuan could no longer stand and swallowed several Ren Dan pills. Presiding Judge Xiao ordered him to sit down and rest for three minutes and then continued the interrogation. Regarding the organization of the Baojia system, he stated, "On the evening of February 14 of the 31st year, explosions occurred in various parts of Shanghai, and the Japanese army blockaded two-thirds of the concessions, causing great harm to the people. Therefore, the Baojia system was implemented to benefit the people and not to eliminate underground workers." As for serving as the general manager of the Dahua Bank run by Shao Shijun from December of the 32nd year to July of the 34th year, it was because he and Shao were old friends. As for the position of member of the Puppet New National Movement Committee, it was a nominal position, and he never attended meetings. At this point, Presiding Judge Xiao announced a postponement for further hearing.

[Special Report] Yesterday morning, the First Special Criminal Tribunal of the High Court, presided over by Judge Liu, tried four more traitor cases: (1) Xu Jiang, from Hangzhou, 60 years old, worked in the Telegraph Department of the Ministry of Transportation before the war.

In the 29th year, he served as the director of the Special Tax Office for Silkworm Construction of the Puppet Ministry of Finance. In January of the 34th year, he served as the director of the Puppet Shanghai Economic Bureau.

In August of the same year, Wang Jingwei convened the Puppet Sixth Plenary Session, and Tang also participated, being elected as a member of the Puppet Central Executive Committee. Later, he was ordered by Wang Jingwei to go to Nanjing to prepare for the takeover of the Puppet Provisional Government agencies. In December of the 29th year, he served as the Permanent Vice Minister of the Puppet Police Department, and later as the Director of the Puppet Jiangsu Construction Department.

Liang Shi, the chief writer of the Puppet苏日报, claimed that he first edited the literary supplement and then served as the chief writer, so he joined the newspaper for livelihood. After Judge Liu questioned each of the above four cases one by one, he announced a postponement for further hearing.

[Our Dispatch] The military tribunal of the First Pacification Zone Command publicly tried Shimoda Jiro, sergeant of the Jiangyin Military Police, yesterday afternoon. Shimoda was one of the chief culprits in the Jiangyin Massacre after the victory. He and Yuasa Torakichi were brought from the Tilanqiao Detention Center at 2:40 PM, remaining silent and sitting quietly in the defendant's waiting room. At 3:00 PM, Presiding Judge Liu Shifang, Judges Qu Zengze, Lu Qi, Jiang Baoli, Jiang Baolian, Prosecutor Lin Wopeng, Clerk Feng Junyue, Translator Luo Jing, and designated defense lawyer Qian Naiwen arrived and took their seats. Shimoda was then brought into the court.

After questioning his name, age, origin, and occupation, Prosecutor Lin began reading the original indictment (see this newspaper on the 9th), and the trial began. (Question) Do you have any response to the indictment? (Answer) I was drunk on the day the incident occurred (i.e., during the massacre) and didn't know anything. What the witnesses said is not true. I hope for an investigation. (Question) What year did you come to China? (Answer) 1939. (Question) What did you do in Japan? (Answer) I worked in a naval factory. (Question) After coming to China in 1939, where did you work and in what position? (Answer) I served in the army in Hankou, as a guard. (Question) Where did you go afterwards? (Answer) I went to Yichang, Nanjing, and received military police training in Nanjing, and then I was assigned to the Wuxi Military Police to handle legal, administrative, and special high-level work. (Question) When did you go to Jiangyin? (Answer) In 1942, I was transferred to the Jiangyin Military Police, serving as a military policeman, and later handling special high-level work. (Question) Isn't special high-level work about killing people? (Answer) No, it's about investigating guerrillas, sometimes using those arrested to gather information. (Question) Who was in charge of the Jiangyin Military Police? (Answer) Captain Nagaoka and Squad Leader Saito. (Question) You confessed in Wuxi that you were next in command after Nagaoka and Saito, didn't you? (Answer) I was a sergeant and didn't know about big things. (Question) How many Chinese did the Jiangyin Military Police kill? (Answer) Except for the last time, there were none. (Question) How many people have you killed? (Answer) Absolutely none. (Question) Have you ever seen anyone killed? (Answer) No. (Question) Then why did you say you did during the prosecutor's investigation? (Answer) Early the next morning, Sergeant Shimizu told me that several Chinese had been killed on the night of August 15th. (Question) When did you learn about Japan's surrender? (Answer) At noon on the 15th, we were notified by Wuxi. At that time, we were ordered to burn and destroy all important documents and statistics, which was completed by 7:00 PM. (Question) Did you know if this procedure was legal? (Answer) I didn't know, I was just following orders. (Question) What did you do after 7:00 PM? (Answer) Drank alcohol, because that day was a Japanese memorial day. (Question) Since you knew you had surrendered, why did you drink alcohol? (Answer) The food and drinks were prepared earlier. At first, I was very unhappy when I heard about the surrender, but later I thought about drinking alcohol and going to fight guerrillas. (Question) How many Chinese were arrested at that time? (Answer) About fifteen or sixteen. (Question) How did you feel when you heard about the killing of Chinese people? (Answer) I didn't feel anything. (Question) How does the witness feel about you? (Answer) It was very good in the past. Two days before the peace, I arrested him, which caused his hatred. (Question) Why were the feelings so good in the past? (Answer) Because he was arrested before and I released him. (Question) Have you ever arrested anyone? (Answer) No. (Question) Then did you arrest the witness? (Answer) Yes. (Question) How many people have you arrested? Tell the truth! (Answer) Only three, named Zhang, Shi, and Yu. The rest have been released. (Question) Why was the person named Zhang arrested? (Answer) On August 10th, there were rumors outside that Japan had surrendered. After investigation, it was Zhang who was the main culprit, so I arrested him.

At this point, the witness Jiang Shoutong was brought to the court for confrontation. Jiang is a professor at Fudan University who was arrested in Jiangyin on July 20th last year and released on August 12th. What he saw and heard in prison was appalling. He stated that he witnessed a young man in his twenties, covered in injuries, being carried in by military police on the evening of August 5th, and only learned the next morning that his name was Shi Akang. However, Shi was eventually stabbed to death by Saito during the massacre. He continued to describe the horrific scene of the massacre on August 15th and pointed out that the defendant, in addition to serving as a sergeant, also served as an instructor for the special operations of the Jiangyin puppet organization. The military police arrested at least five or six hundred compatriots in Jiangyin over the past three years, most of whom were brutally murdered. At this point, the court ordered that the case be further investigated and adjourned for another trial.

After a five-minute recess, the court resumed and brought in Yuasa Torakichi, administrator of the Longhua Prisoner of War Camp. Because Yuasa requested that the two points he raised be investigated: (1) his non-military status; (2) the prisoner food supply was not under his management, and proof that he did not kill prisoners. However, because witnesses could not be summoned, the court ordered another adjournment.

### City School Building Problems: Joint Petition for Relief, Telegram to Chairman Chiang, President Song, etc., Calling for Assistance

[Our City News] During the Anti-Japanese War, municipal middle school buildings in this city were either destroyed or occupied by other organizations for extended periods. For example, the buildings of Wuben Girls' Middle School, Jingye Middle School, Xinlu Normal School, and Wusong Middle School were completely destroyed. Jinyuan Middle School and Xinbei Middle School were occupied by other organizations. Although schools have勉强(biǎn qiǎng: to do with difficulty) commenced classes, the school buildings are not their original ones. Moreover, the Executive Yuan either intends to allocate the current school buildings used by these schools to the private Guanghua University, or to Tongji University, or to return the property to the owners, leaving the schools in a state of uncertainty. It is learned that at the recent meeting of municipal middle school principals, it was decided that the principals would jointly send telegrams to Chairman Chiang, President Song, and Minister Zhu, etc., requesting relief. The original telegram sent to Chairman Chiang is recorded below:

Telegram to the Chairman: To Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the National Government in Nanjing: During the nation-building period, education is paramount, as clearly instructed, with profound significance. Shanghai is an international metropolis, a hub of commerce and industry, with a dense population and a large number of young people gathered here. Nurturing and educating them is of utmost urgency. Since the restoration of the city, the municipal middle schools have been the first to resume operations. We are striving to fulfill this mission under the leadership of Director Gu, deeply aware of the immense responsibility. However, the school buildings have either been destroyed by war or occupied. Very few schools have a secure location, leading to constant displacement, making it difficult to continue. Recently, we have learned that the central government intends to reallocate some of the former Gongdu Bureau elementary school buildings and enemy properties, which the municipal schools have taken over and opened, to some public and private universities. This will cause problems for many municipal middle schools in the next semester, and the impact will be severe. While university education is indeed essential, there is a difference in urgency between opening institutions of higher learning and rescuing those who have lost the opportunity to receive basic education. It is best to achieve both goals in a mutually beneficial manner, rather than sacrificing one for the other. Therefore, we earnestly request Your Excellency to understand the situation and swiftly provide relief by allocating all the former Gongbu Bureau school properties and Japanese enemy school buildings to the municipal schools, to maintain education and cultivate the foundation of the nation. In urgent anticipation of your decision. Respectfully submitted by Jin Tongyin, Chen Baotai, Yang Minghui, Zhao Dingxin, Zhou Cheng, Dong Renjian, Zheng Zhifan, Tao Guangchuan, and other principals of Shanghai municipal middle schools.

### The Re-Erection of the Bronze Statue of the School Founder at Chengzhong Middle School in this City

[Our Newspaper News] Since returning to its original address on Tangshan Road after the victory, Chengzhong Middle School in this city, through the joint efforts of the school board, alumni association, and current faculty and students, has made some progress in the past three months. However, due to the extensive damage, it is difficult to restore its former appearance in a short time. It is reported that the bronze statue of the school founder, which was stolen by Japanese ronin in the past, has recently been retrieved and will be re-erected. The unveiling ceremony is scheduled to be held at 10:00 AM on the 19th of this month, with Director Gu of the Municipal Education Bureau and others attending to preside over the ceremony.

### Villagers in Qingtian County Oppose Jian Teacher Training School, Demolish the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall: Incident Originates from the Use of Skull Bones as Specimens

[Our Newspaper Hangzhou News] A conflict recently erupted between the Qingtian County Jian Teacher Training School in Zhejiang Province and the residents of Zhongyi Township, resulting in the demolition of the school's Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall by the residents. The details are as follows: The school has been using the Tianfei Temple in the county seat as its school building. Students previously found skull bones in the suburbs and used them as specimens for hygiene classes. When local villagers learned of this, they believed that the sacred Buddhist site had been defiled and sought to cause trouble for the school. On March 23rd, when over a thousand residents of Zhongyi Township returned the Buddha statues to Tianfei Temple, they demolished the school's Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, destroyed all the furnishings inside, and forced Principal Zhou of the school to restore Tianfei Temple to its original state and perform a Qingjiao Buddhist ceremony for three nights. Principal Zhou, under the threat of the crowd, had no choice but to comply and performed the Qingjiao ceremony for one night. Now, the school's student union believes that the school is a place for training teachers, and students are the teachers who enlighten the masses. In this era of scientific advancement, the foolish policies of religious superstition should be eradicated. Why should the school come forward, invite Taoist priests to perform a Qingjiao ceremony at the original site of the memorial hall, and be forced to take such absurd actions? This cannot be tolerated any longer. Therefore, the entire student body is opposed to it, no matter the cost. In addition to demanding that Principal Zhou refuse to fulfill the conditions accepted under duress, they have also petitioned the county government to prevent the recurrence of violent threats from the villagers. At the same time, they have sent petitions to the Zhejiang Provincial Government and the Education Department, requesting them to immediately send telegrams to the county to provide protection and emphasize education. Yesterday, they also sent letters to the Hangzhou press, narrating the facts and requesting disclosure, urging all enlightened individuals to uphold justice. (Butterfly)

### Sales Not Strong, Rice Prices Still Rising, Sichuan Grain Shipped by Minsheng Steamship Company

Yesterday, both arrival and sales in the rice market were not strong. Gengxian rice increased by over 1,000 yuan compared to yesterday. Baiyuan rice temporarily lacked fluctuations, but the closing felt weak. This is because the market price was too high after continuous increases, and the output from the stores decreased, so the flow of sales was reduced. In addition, foreign rice has already been ordered, totaling approximately 200,000 bags, causing people's minds to soften. Flour sales were sluggish, falling by 200-300 yuan. Wheat bran followed suit, decreasing by 200-300 yuan. The soybean cake market was also mediocre. Transactions in the wood street countryside were average, and guest gangs only handled small amounts. The arrival and departure of soybeans were both scarce, and the market was stable. Red beans were scarce, and the price increased by 1,000-2,000 yuan. Corn from Nanyang remained unchanged, and a small amount from Qingdao in the north was handled. The market was stable. Red sorghum was active in sales due to the rising price of liquor, increasing by another 1,000 yuan. Due to the surge of goods from Qingdao, the oil market was unable to rise and was weak. According to rice market news yesterday, a total of over 5,000 shi of seven types of rice arrived in the city, including 3,436 shi of Baijing rice, 465 shi of thin rice, 62 shi of early rice, 45 shi of Yangxian rice, 540 shi of Duxian rice, 75 shi of Baiyuan rice, and 15 shi of Yinyuan rice.

According to news from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, it has been decided to use all of the passenger ships of the Minsheng Industrial Company to ship the stored grain from Sichuan. Passengers will be carried as usual. If the amount of cargo increases, the number of passengers and their luggage will be restricted.

### Yarn and Cotton Transactions Scarce, Fabric Market Relatively Stable

Yesterday, the yarn market was weak and sales were slow. The Tianjin and Guangdong customer groups had very little appetite, so 20-count yarn decreased by around 20,000. Transactions of 42-count double-strand yarn were lively. Pure weaving factories also absorbed some, so the price was able to maintain the 2 million mark. At noon, Fangjian opened yarn as usual, offering 20-count Zhiyunpeng and Shuangnv brands. Although there was a Baoguang brand of 42-count yarn listed at 1.95 million, it was limited to lingerie and dyeing factories, so yarn merchants and knitting and cotton weaving factories could only sigh and were unable to purchase it. In addition, seven types of yarn were put up for tender, and it was reported that six companies, including Zhendachang, Shunfeng, Rongyang, Hengxing, Shuixing, and Zhenfengchang, won the bids. The bid prices were as follows: 1.88 million for 42-count Jiuyu, 1.975 million for 42-count unbranded, 2.02 million for 42-count Riguang, 1.67 million for 32-count Yanghe, 1.835 million for 40-count Riguang, 2.38 million for 60-count Yanghe cone yarn, and 1.66 million for 40-count Caiwuzi.

The fabric market was more stable than yarn prices. Most varieties were comparable. Twelve-pound fine cloth, Chuji Shilin, and gray oblique cloth were more popular. In the cotton market, New York American cotton fell by 9 to 18 points, with recent US dollars at 27.17, forward at 27.77, and Miterlin spot at 27.97. The current cotton market in this port is still strong, but transactions are still scarce. Only the Suzhou Sulun Yarn Factory had some transactions.

### Public Bonds Slightly Weaker, Stocks Weakly Lower

After some large investors in public bonds took profits, the market lacked excitement yesterday. At the opening, Category C bonds had already fallen slightly to around 7,150 yuan. Floating shorts were slightly replenished, and after the opening, they once rose to over 7,400 yuan. However, there were more sales again, and the price fell to around 6,850 yuan, causing short positions to cover their profits. Before noon, the price rose again to around 7,300 yuan, and the overall situation turned sideways. As a result, the closing was slightly weaker by 100 yuan compared to the previous day. Miscellaneous brands fell more because of the earlier closing time, with Categories A and B down 350, and Categories D and E down 300 yuan. Retail investors and floating capital in Chinese stocks are eagerly seeking to retreat, and large investors are waiting for opportunities. The market is devoid of stimulation. Since the opening, all stocks have gradually weakened. The process was quiet, and the situation was slightly calmer after noon. As a result, the two most popular stocks continued to decline slightly compared to the previous closing, and Jingfu and Xinguang fell by about 5%. Qinxing, on the other hand, saw a slight increase. Other stocks also declined slightly. Foreign stocks were unfavorable and fell slightly again. Yisha fell from 12,600 yuan to around 12,100 yuan before slightly recovering. Other stocks saw lower prices, with the continued decline about average compared to the previous closing.

### Tea Market Active, Industry Players Buying Yushan Fried Green Tea

Recently, wood street stores, seeing that the price of fried green tea produced in Yushan, Jiangxi, is still relatively reasonable, have been showing interest. Traders are offering around 30,000 yuan per dan. In Hangzhou, merchants from Tianjin and Nanjing are frequently purchasing Xinqi tea in the production area, so people in this city are becoming firmer and reluctant to sell, and the supply is becoming tighter. The supply and demand for aged tea are equal, and there is little change. As for needle-like eyebrow green tea exclusively sold to Morocco in Africa, the British Jardine Matheson is still very interested, and holders are taking the opportunity to sell, pushing the market forward again.

### Floating Long Positions Gradually Liquidating, Gold Prices Continue to Fall, US Dollars Also Affected

Yesterday, the long position in gold collapsed. The market opened lower in the morning, and floating longs gradually liquidated from 1.78 million after the opening. Around 10:00, it fell below 1.74 million and struggled. The Bank of China distributed over 100 taels to the industry, and after several rounds of negotiation, a compromise price of 1.735 million was set. Afterwards, buyers lost interest, and the 1.7 million mark was finally broken at noon. In the afternoon, floating longs were cleared, and money was loose. After falling, it slightly recovered, and finally hovered below 1.75 million. As a result, it continued to fall by 30,000. Decorative gold was 186,000, and shredded silver and silver dollars were flat. The implied interest rate was slightly lower due to loose money, from 1.5 to 1.8 cents.

Foreign currency US dollars were affected by the gold market and decreased slightly. After opening at 2,300 in the morning, they gradually decreased to below 2,250 yuan, and then stabilized slightly. In the afternoon, the gold market stabilized slightly, and there were continued purchases of US dollars, rising to around 2,270 yuan, but it ultimately failed to surpass the morning opening price. As a result, it fell slightly by 10 yuan. Hong Kong dollars were stable, and the buying and selling prices were slightly separated, similar to the previous day. The Hong Kong exchange rate was 45 yuan, and the Robbie exchange rate was 520 yuan, with limited transactions.

### Jiangsu Goods at 700 Million, Promoting Silkworm Cocoon Baking Cooperatives, Undertaking Loan for Stove Repair Costs

With the silk cocoon season approaching, the Shanghai branch of the Small Farmers Bank is holding mortgage loans worth 700 million yuan in various counties of Jiangsu Province. The cost for farmers to raise silkworms this year is estimated to be the equivalent of 5 dan of rice for 1 dan of fresh cocoons, and the price is unlikely to increase. The Shanghai branch of the Central Farmers Bank, in conjunction with the Wuxi Silkworm Breeding Improvement Zone, is organizing silkworm cocoon baking cooperatives to bake and sell cocoons together. The bank has sent special personnel to each county to promote the business of handling cooperative mortgage loans. All members can apply for loans from the Farmers Bank, using the dried fresh cocoons stored in the Farmers Bank or in warehouses designated by the Farmers Bank as collateral for the loan. If a member's existing furnace needs to be repaired, they can also apply to the Farmers Bank for a reasonable amount of repair costs, calculated based on the amount of cocoons received, for a term of two years, with a monthly interest rate of 4%. It is reported that the silkworm cocoon baking cooperative business is being promoted, and a meeting of silkworm farmers is scheduled to be held in Wuxi on the 15th to estimate the actual amount of loans required.

### Silk Slightly Weak

Yesterday, silk was slightly weaker again. The factory silk's high uniformity asking price did not decrease, but foreign firms were unwilling to absorb it, so there were no transactions. Users' high-grade short silk fell by around 50,000 yuan, and dried warp yarn fell by around 20,000-30,000 yuan. 120-count Tianqiao brand rayon opened at 1.38 million, and closed at 1.35 million and 1.36 million, down 20,000 yuan from the previous day. The remaining types were at the same price as the previous day or down 20,000-30,000 yuan. Silk fabrics continued to show weakness. Meiya quilt covers fell by 40,000-50,000 yuan per 100 pieces, and Dacheng lattice fabric fell by 100 yuan per piece.

### Saving to Relieve Famine, US Bans Wheat for Liquor

[United Press, Washington, 14th] Agriculture Secretary Anderson announced today that he will continue to restrict the waste of domestic wheat, restrict the milling of wheat into flour for domestic consumption, and ban the use of wheat for brewing beer and whiskey until June of next year in order to relieve famine abroad. The United States should provide at least 250 million bushels of wheat to famine-stricken areas. The current automatic wheat conservation plan will remain in effect, and the use of wheat as livestock feed will be further restricted. The government will requisition a quarter of the wheat purchased from warehouses and merchants for export. Farmers must sell at least half of the wheat they bring into warehouses for storage.

### Foreign Cloth Arrives in a Steady Stream, Private Textile Factories Request Staff Reduction

Recently, a large quantity of cotton cloth from Mexico has been shipped to Shanghai, and it is being sold by the China Textile Corporation. Its price is lower than that of the Shanghai factories, and the quality is excellent. It is reported that a large quantity will continue to arrive this month and will continue to be sold on the market. It is expected that cotton cloth prices will continue to decline. Recently, private textile factories in this city have requested permission from the authorities to reduce staff because their products are selling poorly, and their production costs are too high to compete with foreign goods.

### British Car Prices Increase

[Reuters, London, 15th] British car and commercial vehicle prices are rising due to rising wages and materials costs. Yesterday, officials from the Austin Motor Company announced that the company's car prices have increased by 6% to 11%. Other manufacturers have also generally increased the average price of vehicle models by 6.5%. British manufacturers can automatically increase prices and need only consult with the government beforehand, unlike the United States, which must first obtain the approval of the Price Management Bureau.

### Sharp Retreat of Sugar Prices

Yesterday, the sugar market suddenly retreated due to rumors of a large amount of goods arriving and the establishment of a new company. The initial price of white sugar at the Sugar Association in the morning was 65,000 yuan, a drop of 3,000 yuan. It then fell slightly to 64,500 yuan to 4,000 yuan. In the afternoon, it fell further to 63,000 yuan, a drop of 5,000 yuan. Other types of sugar also fell accordingly. Three and a half vehicle white sugar was 67,000 yuan, and raw sugar was 55,000 yuan. There were only scattered transactions. Yuanzhou white sugar opened at 70,000 yuan, but no wholesale transactions were made.

### US Actively Storing Hog Bristles, to be Sold by the War Assets Administration

The US government accumulated a large quantity of hog bristles from Chongqing and Calcutta during the war and has now declared them surplus materials. They will soon be sold by the War Assets Administration within a few months. The amount of hog bristles in storage is currently being kept secret, but the business community estimates that it is over one million pounds.

### Shortage of Flannel Inventory

Sales of woolen fabrics remained limited yesterday. However, due to internal market buying, prices slightly increased. Gray flannel for Western-style clothing had some transactions, and inventory is extremely scarce. Timely sales have led to demand exceeding supply. Furthermore, due to the lack of Western goods and Renli Tianma brand fabrics, there's an opportunity for lower-end goods from Zhenfeng and Gongda to sell well. Yesterday, Zhenfeng flannel sold for 40,000 yuan, Gongda old stock for 35,000 yuan, new stock for 30,000 yuan, and miscellaneous brands sold for 27,000 to 28,000 yuan.

### Japan's Import and Export Trade Under the Full Control of MacArthur

Reuters, Washington, 15th dispatch: The U.S. State Department recently announced that control over Japan's import and export affairs is the full responsibility of General MacArthur, the Supreme Commander in Japan. All goods exported to the U.S. must be distributed by a commercial company managed by U.S. officials [a subsidiary of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation]. Regarding international trade matters, informal consultations will also be held with other countries in the shortest possible time. It is understood that Japan's main exports this year are raw silk, cotton textiles, tin, antimony, rubber, tea, silk, etc., which will be supplied to countries urgently in need of these goods.

### Rice Surplus Reaches Over 3 Million Tons; U.S. and Britain Order from Allied Headquarters; Overseas Chinese Raise Funds to Relieve Famine

Siam, known as the granary of the Far East, had an average annual rice export volume of 1,546,124 tons from 1934 to 1938. Since the outbreak of the European War in 1939 and the Japanese landing and occupation in 1941 until 1945, rice exports from Siam were limited due to the intense European and Asian wars and international transportation obstacles. The accumulated rice over these five years is estimated to total 7.5 million tons, according to unofficial statistics. During the Japanese occupation, about 2 million tons were privately transported out by the Japanese army over five years. Flooding in central Siam in 1941 and the spring drought this year resulted in losses of over 1 million tons. This year's rice export volume is estimated to be no less than 3.5 million tons based on accumulated reserves. When Siam fell to the enemy, railways and highways were severely damaged. Currently, domestic transportation and fuel are in short supply. Although the Allied Headquarters has continuously provided assistance, it is still insufficient. The main transportation lines are currently being repaired by Japanese prisoners, but due to a lack of materials, it cannot be remedied in the short term. Therefore, transporting Siamese rice from the interior to the coast is a major challenge. Siam hopes that the United Nations can provide more transportation equipment to facilitate early recovery and food transportation.

It is also reported that after British forces took control of Siam, the government issued a new order restricting the export of four materials: rice, rubber, tin, and teak. Since the victory, statistics show that the Siamese government has donated 200,000 tons of rice to Britain for free to cover the costs of British occupation. Britain has also purchased over 1.2 million *qian* (a unit of weight) of rice from Siam at a price. Currently, both British and American units in Siam are ordering rice from a Siamese government-private joint rice purchasing company on behalf of the Allied Headquarters. The stipulated purchase price is 65 baht (Siamese currency) per 100 *jin* (equivalent to 120 *jin* in Shanghai) for top-quality rice and 35 baht for second-quality rice (each baht is worth 185 legal currency). It is reported that over 100,000 tons have already been purchased.

Mr. Zheng Wulou, Chairman of the Siam Overseas Chinese Relief Committee for the Motherland's Famine, which was formed by overseas Chinese in Siam, took the opportunity of returning to China to attend the National Congress to negotiate with the government on shipping rice back to China for famine relief. It is reported that principles have been agreed upon. If the British and Siamese authorities continue to restrict our purchase and transportation, the 3 million overseas Chinese in Siam plan to launch a food-saving campaign to spare grain for the motherland's famine. According to Zheng, this approach will not affect Siamese rice consumption and should be adopted by the British and Siamese authorities. Zheng also stated that since its establishment last year, the committee has planned to raise 20 million baht to purchase rice to relieve the famine in the motherland. It has already raised over 10 million baht and purchased over 7,400 tons of rice, which has been shipped back to the motherland in three batches since March 15th this year and has been handed over to Guangdong Province for relief. Fundraising is still ongoing, with the goal of raising 20 million baht.

### High Production Costs: A Fatal Blow to Export Industry; Domestic Prices Exceed Foreign Prices; Labor and Interest Burdens Are Not Light; Raising Exchange Rates Is Definitely Not a Good Strategy

(Report from this newspaper) To understand the current situation of the export industry in Shanghai, a reporter visited Mr. Zhang Huanzhang, Chairman of the Shanghai Import and Export Chamber of Commerce. According to him, domestic production costs have been increasing recently. Among China's exports, apart from machine-made products that cannot compete with foreign products, even handicrafts cannot be developed. The reasons are nothing more than: (1) High wages. It is said that the work efficiency of Chinese workers requires three people to equal one foreign worker. However, the current wage level in China has exceeded that of foreign countries. Therefore, China, which was known for its low labor costs, has even fallen behind in this innate advantage, let alone others. (2) Stagnant domestic transportation and high freight costs indirectly increase the cost of exports. (3) High interest rates. Hidden interest rates are often around 20%. If ordinary exports are left in Shanghai for a month, the loss of interest and the additional rent together increase the export cost by 30% per month. Therefore, the trend of exports and general prices is still upward, while the U.S. raw silk market has recently been declining. Exporters are invisibly attacked from both sides and are at a loss. The reporter then inquired whether some people's suggestion to raise the current official exchange rate would help the export industry. He said that raising the exchange rate would not solve the current difficulties of the export industry. Once the exchange rate is raised, general prices will inevitably follow, resulting in export costs not only failing to decrease but instead increasing due to the general rise in prices, which is definitely not a good strategy. Zhang also suggested that the Central Bank should strive to stabilize the price of gold supply, preferably without fluctuating with the market, so as not to be exploited by speculators. Finally, he said that the current situation of the export industry in Shanghai is one of complete helplessness. Even if the government is called upon for relief, the government will feel there is no way to start. The fundamental solution lies in making every effort to reduce production costs so that exports can compete in the international market. If this problem can be solved, other minor problems will be easily resolved. Zhang then stated that the Shanghai Import and Export Chamber of Commerce has 400 to 500 members, but less than 1% are actually engaged in export business. Most of the others are engaged in import business. However, most of the imports are consumer goods. He cited the price list of export goods recently sent from the United States as an example: leather shoes ranging from US$3.40 to US$5 per pair, felt hats ranging from US$3 to US$6 per piece, new woolen suits (three pieces) ranging from US$45 to US$50 per set, women's spring coats ranging from US$24 to US$34 per piece, etc. The above prices are retail prices, and the quality of each item is selected to be the best. If we take the prices of shoes and clothing in the United States, they are not enough to cover labor costs in China, let alone raw materials. Recently, due to the undesirable production conditions in Shanghai, the U.S. company Weili Han has planned to move to Hong Kong, and the British-American Tobacco Company also intends to move to Japan to start production. Therefore, to improve the production conditions in Shanghai, it is essential to reduce production costs first.

### General Du Yuming in the Flames of War - Reported on the 13th by Our Newspaper - Special Dispatch from Reporter Zhao Haosheng from Nanjing

Looking towards the Northeast, I miss General Du Yuming.

Time has not diminished my memory of General Du. I saw General Du in Chongqing as far back as half a year ago, when he had just been appointed as the Commander of the Northeast Security Headquarters and was preparing to depart in a day or two. At that time, the chairmen and mayors of the nine provinces and two cities in the Northeast, as well as Mr. Liu Zhe, the director of the Changchun Railway, were present. They were giving General Du a farewell dinner and exchanging views on the security issues in the Northeast.

First Impression

General Du arrived ten minutes before the agreed time. He was wearing a grass-green woolen military uniform, and the first impression he gave was that he was energetic, robust, and full of vitality. He was not tall, nor did he have the general-type stoutness. His face was plain, but his eyebrows were sharp, and the light in his eyes and the muscles at the corners of his mouth fully showed the tension peculiar to a soldier. General Du's appearance, his thoughts, and his courage were all a concrete manifestation of "power." He greeted everyone with his pure Shaanxi dialect, which sounded simple and homely and was completely in harmony with General Du's personality.

Every Northeasterner present expressed their welcome and good fortune that General Du had been sent to the Northeast.

The Victorious General

Bishop Yu Bin called General Du "the victorious general." During the conversation, everyone had a few suggestions for General Du: first, because the Northeast had suffered the longest, they hoped that General Du would provide more comfort and use less force after the overall victory; second, because people from Guannei (inside the passes) were relatively unfamiliar with the Northeast, they needed people familiar with the local situation to assist in the implementation of relief work, so they hoped that General Du would employ more Northeasterners under his command.

The National Army Is the Motherland

General Du said that he went to the Northeast entirely with a service mentality. He hoped to get assistance and guidance from the people of the Northeast. He deeply felt the arduousness of this mission. When talking about military-civilian cooperation, he said that in the eyes of a commander, as long as there were disputes between the military and civilians, regardless of who was at fault, the soldiers should be punished. He repeatedly emphasized that the responsibilities of the National Army in the Northeast, both psychologically for the people and in terms of practical tasks, were extremely arduous. The people of the Northeast saw the National Army as seeing the motherland. The National Army should bring happiness and stability to the compatriots in the Northeast who had lived in suffering for fourteen years. General Du's words were sincere, and they were extremely touching in the absence of any embellished rhetoric.

New Heroic Epic

The elderly told General Du about the climate in the Northeast and hoped that he would prepare winter clothing for the soldiers early. Young people hoped that General Du could write a heroic epic in the Northeast that could be passed down for generations. The atmosphere at that time was like a family sitting together, chatting intimately. No one imagined, and no one wanted to imagine, that the Northeast would evolve into the chaotic situation it is in today.

General Du's Efforts

A beautiful dream of peace and stability has turned into a tragic nightmare. Just as the reporter once heard Mr. Liu Zhe talk about his feelings about Changchun in Chongqing: "Being trapped in Changchun is like standing at the door of your home but not being able to go in. There is nothing more cruel in the world."

Half a year ago, General Du Yuming went to the Northeast with the hopes and dreams of the people of the Northeast. Today, General Du Yuming is fighting for the realization of the hopes and dreams of millions of people in this chaotic situation. Looking towards the Northeast, I miss General Du Yuming, the general galloping through the flames of war.

### How to Eradicate Opium? - Zhu Zonghai

Opium contains narcotic properties, and anyone who becomes addicted finds it difficult to extricate themselves. Morphine, cocaine, heroin, and other narcotics are even more harmful than opium. Our national government promulgated the "Provisional Regulations for Punishing Opium and Drug Offenses" on February 19, 1941, as a special criminal law to punish those who violate opium and drug bans. Since the implementation of the "Morphine Punishment Law" in 1914, various opium prohibition laws, "Provisional Regulations for Strictly Prohibiting Highly Addictive Drugs," "Provisional Regulations for Punishing Opium Offenses," and "Provisional Regulations for Punishing Drug Offenses" have been promulgated, up to the current "Provisional Regulations for Punishing Opium and Drug Offenses." The process has taken over 20 years, which cannot be considered short. The punishments range from death or life imprisonment to imprisonment for more than one year, which cannot be considered lenient. Despite such strict laws and severe punishments, the opium ban has been in place for over 20 years, but it still cannot be eradicated, and the number of opium addicts has increased rather than decreased. Is it really that people are not afraid of death and enjoy it, or is there something to reflect on in the implementation of the opium prohibition policy?

The crime of opium is different from ordinary crimes. For ordinary crimes, such as murder, robbery, theft, and other offenses, the state enacts strict laws and diligently apprehends offenders. Those who have committed crimes are imprisoned, and those who have not committed crimes are deterred. This is sufficient to achieve the effect of punishment. However, this is not the case for opium offenses. The amount of opium smoked increases over time, and the addiction grows stronger over time. The bodies of addicts are harmed by opium, and symptoms such as constipation, insomnia, tremors, reduced appetite, and mental depression appear. If their addiction is not satisfied, symptoms such as vomiting, tearing, runny nose, and palpitations will worsen, and some may even die from withdrawal. Therefore, ordinary criminals only need to be imprisoned, deprived of their freedom, and educated to develop a sense of repentance and reform. This is the expertise of prison scholars. However, simply imprisoning opium addicts without providing them with detoxification drugs is tantamount to putting them to death. Therefore, for opium addicts, medical treatment is more important than imprisonment, and rehabilitation is better than punishment. The ultimate goal of the national opium prohibition policy is to help smokers quit, prevent non-smokers from developing this habit, and improve the health of the nation. However, everyone is lazy, especially opium addicts. Without external pressure, few are willing to endure the pain of detoxification and commit to quitting. To enable addicts to commit to quitting, widespread detoxification hospitals and detoxification drugs are needed. However, hoping is not enough and is of no practical use. Establishing such widespread detoxification hospitals faces both manpower and financial difficulties. Shanghai is a concentrated area for opium addicts. Recently, a large number of addicts have been arrested, and prisons are overcrowded, while the lack of detoxification hospitals remains the same. If Shanghai is like this, the situation in other places can be imagined. If the national opium prohibition policy continues on this path, it will probably be difficult to eradicate opium even after another 20 years. For example, if there are 100,000 opium addicts in Shanghai, is there a prison that can accommodate 100,000 people? Since there is no prison that can accommodate 100,000 people, it is impossible to imprison all 100,000 addicts. Therefore, among the addicts, some are lucky and some are unlucky; some are arrested and some are not. Once arrested, the prison is unable to accommodate everyone and has to release them on bail. In this way, arresting and releasing at the same time, treating opium offenders as ordinary criminals, imprisoning and punishing them, but failing to provide them with medical treatment and rehabilitation. Inevitably, addicted smokers cannot quit, and non-smoking compatriots, seeing that there are still many smokers in society, believe that it is harmless to develop this bad habit. They start by playing around and then become addicted. How can this achieve the effect of eradication? Therefore, I propose to supplement the opium prohibition policy with criminal policy and formulate the following implementation plan:

1.  Opium offenders who have been arrested and who are genuinely willing to quit and can afford the detoxification expenses should be allowed to provide reliable guarantors, designate a hospital, and set a time limit for quitting. Those who fail to quit within the time limit should be severely punished within the scope of the statutory penalty to deter those who are playing games.

2.  Impoverished opium offenders who have been arrested should be sent to public detoxification hospitals for free rehabilitation.

3.  Opium addicts who have not been discovered but have entered hospitals for detoxification should not be arrested because they are taking detoxification medicine in the hospital instead of smoking opium. This allows them to follow through with their commitment to quit. After they quit and are discharged from the hospital, this point can be interpreted in two ways in law: (a) Opium addicts who have not registered by the end of March are in violation of the "Provisional Regulations for Punishing Opium and Drug Offenses," regardless of whether they have entered a hospital for detoxification, and should be arrested. (b) Since they have entered a hospital for detoxification, what they are inhaling is detoxification medicine and not opium. To implement the national opium prohibition policy, they should be allowed to reform and should not be arrested again to interfere with their good intentions to quit. I prefer the latter interpretation.

4.  Where does the opium that addicts smoke come from? It is obtained from four types of people: those who grow opium, those who manufacture opium, those who traffic opium, and those who run opium dens. If the above four types of opium offenders are severely punished, the source of opium can be cut off, and the actual effect of opium prohibition can be quickly achieved.

5.  According to Article 8 of the "Post-Purification Opium Suppression Measures" promulgated by the Executive Yuan, "Autonomous organizations, social groups, and public-spirited individuals should jointly organize an Opium Prohibition Association to assist in propaganda, reporting, rehabilitation, and relief." Shanghai should organize this Opium Prohibition Association, raise funds from society, and establish widespread detoxification hospitals, or solicit large donations directly from wealthy opium addicts with status. In short, since the national treasury cannot afford this huge detoxification expense, and the government is determined to eradicate opium, we cannot bear to see a large number of opium addicts die in prison due to the lack of detoxification drugs. Soliciting donations from opium addicts will inevitably lead to abuses and be criticized. However, when choosing between two evils, it is better to choose the lesser evil. It is better to donate a few more dollars so that more people can quit opium.

The above points are my opinions expressed from the standpoint of a citizen and are not related to my current position as a public official. I hereby declare this jointly.

### The First Voice of Democracy in Hangzhou: A Quick Sketch of the Municipal Assembly Election Scene

— Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng, Hangzhou Correspondence from This Newspaper, 12th

Following Shanghai's election of municipal assembly members, Hangzhou City also elected its municipal assembly members on May 12th. Half a month before the election, this reporter interviewed the person in charge of the Municipal Provisional Assembly to ask for their opinion on this municipal assembly election. They said, "Hangzhou cannot be compared to Shanghai. Shanghai is vigorous, but Hangzhou is always calm and steady."

Campaign Activities: Not Enthusiastic Enough

The government announced a total of 114 candidates from various regions and professional groups. The number of regularly elected formal and alternate municipal assembly members was 84, which meant there were fewer than two candidates for each seat. However, according to what this reporter knows, there were quite a few people lobbying and socializing behind the scenes, but they rarely gave public speeches to the citizens or boldly announced their views on municipal construction. Only in the two days before the election did some candidates host a press conference. They particularly emphasized the reasons why Hangzhou was not enthusiastic enough, saying that it represented perseverance and simplicity. At that time, they put forward their proposals, which included the need for housing, good roads to travel on, attention to hygiene, and promotion of domestic goods. Some even attacked other candidates, claiming to represent a certain sector.

After the candidates' tea party, Hangzhou Mayor Zhou Xiangxian also held a tea party to entertain the press. During the meeting, he explained the election law. Someone said, "We haven't received our citizen certificates yet." Zhou took out an identity card from his suit pocket and said, "I have already received mine." The person in charge of education in the municipal government, after explaining the election of the Educational Association, added, "If I vote, I will definitely vote for so-and-so."

Citizen certificates were rarely processed in the few days prior to the election. My office is on Qingtai Road. Some citizen certificates in the Qingtai Road area were only received on the eve of the election. At a certain residence on Xiaxi Street, the household registration had already been investigated and completed, but they had not received their citizen certificates on the day of the election. Citizen certificates were printed on small pieces of white newsprint. Everything was printed on it, only the citizen's name and residence information were written in, along with the date of issuance. In Hangzhou's election of representatives of public opinion organs, the most enthusiastic performance was by the press. For nearly a week, newspapers promoted the candidates daily, but some newspapers slightly favored the promotion of certain candidates, which was barely noticeable. On the eve of the election, Mr. Wu Wangji, the president of Zheng Bao, initiated the organization of a municipal assembly election reporter tour. The next day, a jeep was borrowed, and reporters from various newspapers who volunteered to go could gather and set off. Participating newspapers included Southeast Daily, Zhejiang Daily, Datong Daily, and Zheng Bao. This reporter was also invited to participate. First, we went to the Municipal Farmers' Association. Professional groups elected through initial election representatives. The election method was to elect one person in the first round, requiring more than half the votes, and the next highest vote-getter would be the alternate. However, the first alternate could still be elected in the second round. We arrived at the Farmers' Association and saw many farmers sitting on benches listening to explanations of the election methods. Later, we went to the first district polling station in Tongcheng Temple. District elections are direct universal suffrage, where people go directly to vote, and the majority wins the election, with the next highest vote-getter as the alternate. However, Tongcheng Temple did not seem very enthusiastic. Coming out of Tongcheng Temple, we drove to Nanxing Bridge, seeing the dilapidated houses burned and destroyed by the enemy, and thinking about how the people have gained sovereignty today, we were truly overjoyed. Arriving at the polling station, a sign was posted at the entrance saying, "Those who are not voting are not allowed to enter." Inside the ballot distribution point, many farmers from the fields crowded around, some very young, some holding babies, and some elderly ladies over sixty years old. It was quite enthusiastic. One candidate was speaking loudly, saying, "The district chief wants to get elected himself, so he personally distributes citizen certificates."

Rickshaw Pullers and Tea Servers: Representatives of Public Opinion

We went to the Chamber of Commerce, where they had already finished the election, and who was elected had already been announced. One of the elected alternates was laughing heartily. After all, they were all business tycoons, so there was a lot of courtesy and deference. Later, we hurried to the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions. They had already elected their representatives. We heard that one of them was a tea server, and another was a rickshaw puller, which are truly representatives of public opinion. Then we went to Huixing Middle School, which was one of the polling stations in the second district. Director Ruan had already come to vote. In the corner of the classroom, someone was writing intently. I went over to take a look and realized they were rushing to write out "citizen certificates." We also went to Hongdao Elementary School, where a clerk was dozing off. The director of the polling station said, "The voting situation hasn't reached the saturation point yet."

Which One to Choose? Choose the First One

We crossed several roads and thought about going to East Street Road to see the third district election. We asked a policeman, but the policeman didn't know anything about the polling station. It was the same as "asking a policeman in Nanxing Bridge where the election was and the policeman saying he didn't know." In the end, a primary school student led us to East Street Road Central Elementary School. We saw many women voting. The ballot writer asked which one they wanted to choose. The women said, "Choose the first one." The first one was the district chief's name. Walking out of the elementary school gate, many people told us that a certain lawyer had posted a red paper strip on the gate of Central Elementary School, writing: "Vote for so-and-so today." We were ashamed of his usual behavior, so it was torn off.

We proceeded to the free professions' polling station, which had also concluded. Lawyer So-and-so and pharmacist So-and-so were elected as formal assembly members, and journalist So-and-so was elected as an alternate.

Circling around the lakeside and climbing onto Broken Bridge, we went to the Zuo Jiang Er Gong Temple on the outer West Lake. In the morning, a reporter told us that there had been some minor disturbances there. When we arrived, the disturbances were gone. We heard that Mayor Zhou had also come to vote. Bamboo poles were used to create entrances and exits to maintain order. One account of the morning's disturbances said that it was caused by a slight delay in issuing ballots. Another account said that someone had obtained twenty-four citizen certificates and exchanged them for thirty-five ballots, which caused the dispute.

Circling around Su Causeway, we listed the polling station near Jingci Temple. There, the people were still enthusiastically voting. When we arrived, the staff appeared particularly nervous. Someone went to vote, and we asked him which one he was going to choose. He said, "I don't know." The clerk read out the names to him, emphasizing "so-and-so" when he got to that name. The voter then seemed to realize and chose "so-and-so."

Intellectuals Are After All Different

Coming out of Jingci Temple, I felt extraordinarily emotional. I turned to the Provincial People's Education Museum by the lake to see the election of the Educational Association, which was a direct election and was handled in an orderly manner and on a large scale. Intellectuals are different after all.

On the way back, we thought that this was the first time after all, and that even if there were some mistakes, they should be forgiven. However, once we know the mistakes, we should correct them immediately. For example, the delayed issuance of citizen certificates and the lack of caution on the part of the ballot writers can all serve as lessons for the next election. At the same time, the candidates in this election were not enthusiastic enough. Even though the candidates exaggerated that Hangzhou was "sincere, simple, calm and steady," they should raise the importance of their own rights and political interest to the highest degree. The speeches made by the candidates also lacked stimulating content. We hope that there will be more and more candidates, and more and more voters. The more there are, the higher the understanding of democracy will be. If we are afraid of enthusiasm causing trouble and only want the election to pass "peacefully," then that is not right.

I heard that several well-learned scholars were not elected this time, and that Li Peien, the vice chairman of the Provisional Assembly and president of Zhijiang University, was only elected as an alternate. These are all things that need special attention.

### Plague Invades Zhuji

— Feicun, Zhuji Correspondence, 5th

Besides food causing panic here, the plague is threatening people's lives. In this post-eight-year war situation, people's livelihoods are still not guaranteed. Black news is continuously coming from the countryside, first the Black Death, meningitis, followed by smallpox, etc. Smallpox has already taken the lives of many lively children, and even adults have died from it. Especially in schools, the contagiousness of the disease is even greater. Almost every school has students "absent due to smallpox." In one particular bao school, half of the fifty students have contracted smallpox.

Newspapers are shouting almost every day, "Pay attention to the plague!" But the health authorities are too poor and cannot bear the responsibility. They can only save one side while neglecting the other, resulting in a completely unmanaged situation. Human power is clearly unable to extinguish it. To the villagers, everyone can only beg for blessings from the gods. Various villages are holding grand welcome ceremonies for the gods to ask for protection. Some opportunistic elements who do not do honest work are taking advantage of this situation to profit from the chaos, using festival competitions as an excuse to perform plays and gamble, ultimately leaving the villagers impoverished, while the plague god still bares its fangs and claws, demanding lives. Speaking of which, this is quite tragic. For the sake of festival competitions and asking for the protection of the bodhisattva, apportioned donations are being universally enforced.

### Loyal, Ardent and Brave: Martyr General Zhang Zizhong

— Pingzhai

When Yin Rugeng was organizing a puppet regime in eastern Hebei, I was studying in Beijing. At that time, the defense of the Beijing-Tianjin area was entirely the responsibility of General Song Mingxuan of the Twenty-ninth Army. Next to the majestic and solid walls of Beijing, the brave soldiers of the Twenty-ninth Army stood quietly, among the weeds growing on the parapets. The harsh north wind carried the yellow sand of the North China Plain, blowing their thin gray cloth uniforms, blowing the red tassels on the handles of the broadswords on their backs.

The people felt a little more at ease. Although Wangfujing Street was filled with staggering Japanese soldiers, although the streets and alleys were filled with white-faced shops run by Koreans, and although corpses of unknown cause often floated on the Hai River, everyone clearly remembered that the Twenty-ninth Army were the heroes of Gubeikou and Xifengkou. Those shining blades had once been dipped in the blood of countless Japanese soldiers! However, the situation was getting worse and worse. Patriotic students were repeatedly arrested. "Independent Review" was ordered to cease publication because it published an article opposing the special status of North China. The author of that article, Professor Zhang Xiruo, was ordered to be arrested. The slogan "Down with Japanese Imperialism" became the most dangerous taboo.

Only Qin Decun spoke passionately and generously to everyone, saying, "I, Qin, will never sell out the country!"

Everyone else kept an embarrassing silence.

Finally, the Anti-Japanese War began at the beautiful Lugou Bridge! The people of all of China roared for resistance against Japan, and the mountains and hills of all of China echoed with earth-shattering sounds: Resist Japan! However, who knew that Zhang Zizhong did not leave!

Could it be that this hero who fought to the death at Xifengkou had changed his mind?

On the sixth anniversary of General Zhang's martyrdom, recalling the thoughts at that time, I feel infinitely ashamed and infinitely regretful! I should quote Chairman Jiang's comment on General Zhang: "He is not disturbed by the rights and wrongs and praises and criticisms of the world, this is the mind of an ancient minister planning for the country, which is not something that ordinary people can understand, nor is it something that ordinary people can undertake!" Who knew? At that time, General Zhang had already left a will, ready to die for the country!

When the all-out war of resistance began, General Zhang finally secretly sailed across the sea and arrived in the capital. Chairman Jiang knew his painstaking efforts and resolutely appointed him as the commander of the Fifty-ninth Army. In February of the 27th year, he reinforced the Huaihe front, and made several fierce counterattacks, recovering many strongholds, causing the enemy to suffer the first setback at a time when their fierce flames were spreading. In March of the same year, the enemy's most elite "iron cavalry" Itagaki Division pounced on Linyi, preparing to enter He'erzhuang and invade Xuzhou. General Zhang was ordered to rush to the aid day and night, traveling one hundred and eighty li in one day! After seven days and nights of fierce fighting, the enemy's planes, artillery, and tanks densely bombed, but General Zhang personally commanded the machine guns amidst the hail of bullets and rushed

At the beginning of the second phase of the War of Resistance, General Zhang was the commander-in-chief of the Thirty-third Group Army and the commander-in-chief of the right-wing corps of the Fifth War Zone, stationed in Jingmen, permanently protecting Xiangfan, and completed the victories of southern Henan and northern Hubei three times, until the 29th year of the Republic of China, when the enemy dared not look west.

On May 1, 29th year of the Republic of China, the enemy's Third Division, Thirty-ninth Division, and two temporary detachments launched a fierce attack. On May 9, General Zhang wrote to Deputy Commander Feng Zhian: "Crossing the river, I am determined to fight to the death. This separation may be forever." He also conveyed to the generals: "When the enemy attacks, brother will go to the east bank of the river to sacrifice with my brothers. The country has reached this point, and there is no other way but for us to die for the country. Brother's determination to die for the country and the nation will never change, even if the sea dries up and the rocks crumble. I hope you brothers will encourage each other!"

It was with this state of mind that he personally led a small number of troops across the river.

Amidst the bloody rain and wind, General Zhang only ate a little broad beans to satisfy his hunger every day.

At dawn on the sixteenth, the enemy was getting closer. General Zhang had been surrounded layer upon layer. At noon, the bullets became denser and denser. General Zhang had already been hit by a rifle bullet in his left arm. In order to stabilize the morale of the army, he did not bandage it, and let the blood flow!

He refused to move his position, only ordering his subordinates to disperse, so as not to become the enemy's shooting target. At two thirty, all the officers and soldiers on the right wing were sacrificed. General Zhang was filled with grief and indignation, and led the last remaining few people to rush towards the right wing!

This was the last charge! General Zhang was hit by six machine gun wounds in a row, and his right chest was also pierced. He drew out the sword given by the leader and committed suicide, but his adjutant Zhu Zengyuan hugged him, but he had lost too much blood and finally could not hold on. Amidst the sound of cannons and machine guns, he hoarsely said, "To the country, to the nation, to the leader, to my conscience, I am at peace!"

In this way, he used facts to show his loyalty to the country, and he used his hot blood to write a glorious history of the Chinese nation.

General Zhang's loyalty, bravery, and benevolence deeply moved the enemy. They treated General Zhang's remains with the honor of a general, and all officers and soldiers attended the ceremony. But finally, six days later, the officers and soldiers of our Thirty-eighth Division found the coffin and carried it back to the defense area. Deputy Commander Feng led all the officers and soldiers to welcome him dozens of miles outside the city, crying bitterly over the coffin, their sorrow shaking the heavens and the earth!

The coffin arrived in Chongqing on May 28th. Chairman Jiang personally led all the central authorities to welcome him at the Jianggan wharf, tears falling like rain!

Our victory is not accidental. From now on, let us forever commemorate this heroic national hero who dominated the battlefield every year on May 16, the anniversary of General Zhang's martyrdom, with the most pious and sorrowful sincerity, and let us pay tribute to the thousands of military and civilians who sacrificed in the War of Resistance! Once, he was only a hundred steps away from the enemy's tanks, he lay in the roadside fortifications, commanded the pistol team, and attacked the enemy with hand grenades! The soldiers burned with the blood of the Great Wall War of Resistance. Although their weapons were not as good as others, and their training was not as good as others, they still followed one another and repeatedly charged, and finally repelled the stubborn enemy!

When the Battle of Wuhan began, General Zhang was ordered to advance into Huangchuan to cover the main force of Xinyang. This was an isolated army, and the situation was very dangerous. The order from the command was to defend for five to seven days, but he personally braved arrows and stones, fighting fiercely for eleven days and nights. Even the enemy's radio admitted that they had encountered a strong enemy they had never seen before. In the army, General Zhang once telegraphed to his younger brother Ziming, saying: "As long as I am not dead for one day, I will fulfill my responsibility to kill the enemy for one day. If the enemy does not leave for one day, I will be loyal to the death!" He crossed the river.

The battle line was really long, and General Zhang could only draw on three regiments and two battalions. But the enemy added more than 20 planes and more than 10 heavy artillery pieces. A bloody battle unfolded in the drizzle. On May 11, there were more than a dozen repeated melees! On the 12th, he advanced to Zaoyang. General Zhang personally went to the front line to supervise the army, and the Japanese army finally retreated.

Starting on the 13th, General Zhang was ordered to turn to attack the enemy's 13th Division, which was advancing south. The battle line was in the Fangjiaji Nanguadian area. But at that time, not only were the generals and soldiers trapped, but even the food and ammunition were gradually running out. The enemy changed their plan and specialized in encircling General Zhang. The planes bombed densely, and General Zhang's troops were less than 3,000 people.

### The Problem of Children Lying

— Fanxi

"Lying" is clearly in conflict with the inherent honesty of children. Why most children have a habit of lying occupies a very important research position in child psychology. Stern conducted many experiments, and the results all proved that lying is not the nature of children, but is due to the influence of acquired real-life environment. Therefore, to prevent children from lying, we must first understand the inner impulses of children's psychology and various emotions. Sometimes, because children do not correctly understand things and are easily influenced by suggestions, they say words that are contrary to their thoughts. If it is considered that this is lying, it is the biggest mistake. When a young child does not know the difference between a tiger and a leopard, he will say to his mother: "Mom, there was a big tiger in the movie!" In fact, what he saw was just a leopard; or he would see a lamb and call it a curly-haired dog. Such facts are often found in the conversations of young children. Children themselves are not lying, but because their understanding of things is too low. They do not have the ability to correctly distinguish things, and often regard large animals as tigers, or they often hear the term curly-haired dog, and then apply it to every small animal. Therefore, children's lying sometimes evolves from this type of fact and gradually becomes a habit. Moreover, children's imaginations are lively, and they fabricate facts and objective imaginations together, without feeling at all that they are being deceived by fictitious facts. Below are some common reasons for children's lying, which smart parents should pay attention to at all times:

(1) Driven by Selfish Ideas—Selfishness is human nature. When children first start social life, they want to monopolize all the toys of their companions. Therefore, children often want to lie to get a little benefit, or lie to satisfy their desires.

(2) Imitating Adults—Children have the greatest tendency to imitate. Children of four or five months old know how to learn the gestures and facial expressions taught by adults. Children can try to learn the appearance of their grandfather getting angry, and the posture of their grandmother eating. More obvious is that when one baby cries, another baby cries along; or when they see a child eating a pear, they would rather give up the orange in their hand and eat the pear. Therefore, parents often become examples of children lying due to temporary negligence. For example, to avoid seeing a guest, they tell their children: "Go tell Uncle Zhang quickly that Mom and Dad are not at home. Good baby, be obedient." Or they have children say they are a few years younger in order to get free rides, etc. These subtle facts can arouse children's motivation to lie; such facts are simply rewarding lying invisibly.

(3) Due to Greed or Laziness—This is also a tendency of selfishness. Children always hope to get a little more candy than others, so they often have to put on a straight face and show a pitiful appearance, saying: "I didn't eat a single pear today." or "All four candies were eaten by my brother, and I didn't get any." This kind of lying is entirely for the sake of getting more food. Children in elementary schools often say "My stomach hurts" because they haven't finished their homework or don't want to do cleaning work.

(4) Due to Fear—Fear is the main reason for children's lying. Most parents often find that when children have a little mistake, they will ask loudly and sternly, or even beat and scold them, which greatly affects the child's self-esteem. For the sake of self-esteem, children often lie to deceive their parents to avoid the punishment or beatings at the time.

(5) Due to Vanity and Cunning—Children have strong self-esteem, and at no time are willing to show their weakness or unreasonableness. Low-energy children, even if they are bullied by their companions, still boast how heroic and powerful they are in front of other companions. Lying with cunning is rare among young children. Children's cunning is usually fully revealed after the age of ten.

How to Prevent Lying?

Since we know that the reasons for lying are entirely due to acquired environment and habits, then teachers and parents must be particularly careful about the environment in which children are located. In addition to paying more attention to the cultivation of character and the formation of upright and friendly character, we must also pay attention to the following things:

(1) Loyalty—Whether it is a teacher or a parent, the attitude towards children must be loyal, set an honest example for children, and use honesty to gain children's faith. Every move must win the children's worship and respect.

(2) Gentleness—Love is the driving force of all educational behaviors, so smart teachers and kind parents should always maintain a gentle attitude towards children. Even when a child is found to have a mistake, he should be persuaded gently, not beaten or scolded, because intimidation and temptation can cause lying.

(3) Fairness—Treat children with absolute fairness, because children have strong self-esteem, and do not let them suffer undeserved insults. Pay more attention not to reward children for success obtained by cunning, and do not criticize a certain child for being stupid or a certain child for being smart in front of many people. Nor should you use punishment to correct his mistakes. This is not only useless, but also increases the child's desire to lie. You should also create an honest environment for children and secretly reward honest behavior. The most important thing is not to make children apologize in public. Use an honest, fair, and loving attitude to make the children repent themselves.

The above-mentioned points, of course, cannot include all educational methods, but if smart parents can truly implement them, then your children will not develop the habit of lying.

### How to Commemorate Mother's Day

— Geng Xing

A few days ago, when we celebrated Mother's Day, I discussed with several friends: How should children commemorate it? How to commemorate it meaningfully?

I think work is the best way to commemorate it.

Mothers are as Jarvis, the founder of Mother's Day, said: "Suffer more and enjoy less." Think about it: from ten months of pregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding to raising them to adulthood, which one is not the mother's business, which moment does she not worry about? Especially in China, where the social children's nursery industry is still in its infancy, and the unscientific nature of all equipment in the family, coupled with the increasingly high level of life today, mothers in general middle and lower families are really the most hard-working and even the most painful. They cannot afford servants. In addition to taking care of their children, they have to handle all the affairs in the family. The heavy burden of work makes them breathless. They get up early and go to bed late, and there is no moment of peace, let alone any entertainment.

Therefore, due to the lack of rest and adjustment in body and spirit, their bodies become weak and their youth quickly disappears. The spirit is stimulated by physical fatigue and even pain, the annoyance of children, the busyness of family trivial matters, and the heavy economic pressure, which often makes them become depressed, irritable, and easily angry; in this way, not only does she feel pain herself, but also the entire family atmosphere becomes tense and gloomy, which also has a bad influence on the children's spirits.

Therefore, if the children are old enough and physically able to do something, then in their spare time from studying, try to help their mothers do something and share some of her labor! And try to do it well, do the work with a playful mood, and do the work as happily as a game. Because excellent work results not only make you happy, but also make your mother happy, increase the atmosphere of harmony between families, and give the gift of happiness to young siblings.

For example, if you sweep the dusty room clean, wipe the dark glass windows bright, and arrange the cluttered objects in an orderly manner, when the work is completed, you will definitely feel infinite comfort and satisfaction with this refreshed scene in front of you, and your mother will definitely praise your ability, making her feel that her life's hard work for you is not in vain, but has received great comfort!

I know that you are all deeply loved by your mothers, so your mother's happiness should also be your happiness. What can make your mother happy is helping her operate and reducing her hard work. So every year when you commemorate Mother's Day, you have to find something that can make your mother the happiest to do.

### Meaningful Commemoration

— Hu Bei

A week before Mother's Day, I suddenly received an English letter from a stranger, and what the letter said aroused my interest very much. Now I will make this letter public so that readers can appreciate it together. The letter said:

"I have always been thinking about my mother, thinking about her gentleness, thinking about her great sacrifices, thinking about her kindness, thinking about her... well, you know all those countless precious memories of mothers. I suddenly remembered that May 12th is Mother's Day, and on that day, all people in the world will respect their mothers, some will wear a carnation flower on their chest, and some will send flowers or candy or other things to their mothers. I think maybe some friends would like to commemorate Mother's Day like I do. The greatest suffering and sacrifice of a mother's life is childbirth. We who can get the best medical equipment still feel uneasy when giving birth, so what about those who cannot afford the best doctors to deliver their babies? Isn't helping poor mothers get proper medical care the best way to express our gratitude to our mothers? Therefore, I donated money to the Shanghai Civilian Women and Children's Hospital at 995 Kang Nao Road, because this is a place to help poor mothers get the best medical equipment before and after childbirth. After the baby is born, the medical expenses for the mother and newborn baby to stay in the hospital for ten days cost 20,000 yuan in national currency. I thought you might want to commemorate your mother in this way on Mother's Day."

Later, after investigation, I learned that this hospital is presided over by the famous doctor Dr. Wang Yihui, and the equipment is quite complete. It is really a good place for poor pregnant women who want to be mothers. If any readers want to commemorate their mothers in this meaningful way, they can donate directly to the hospital.

### Little Dress

— Shufang

This is a small dress suitable for wearing now, preferably made of cloth. The top uses about one yard of white poplin material. The skirt uses four feet of material. The ones with a big red background and small white flowers or a sky blue background are beautiful.

Cut the size according to the style in the picture. Cut the skirt diagonally into a semi-circle, install a waistband, and then add suspenders to make a very beautiful and simple small skirt. The making of the top is very simple, and it can also be made with long sleeves, which looks very elegant when matched with skirts of any color.

### Mother's Day After Victory

— Xu Baiyi

I remember that on May 10, 1942, this newspaper published a special Mother's Day issue. At that time, it was the second Mother's Day, and a program was made to formulate three meanings, namely, 1. Promoting filial piety, 2. Promoting parental education, and 3. Relieving distressed parents.

On the twelfth of this month, we celebrated the first Mother's Day after victory. I think the above three points are still suitable. Regarding the first point, filial piety was originally considered a virtue by Chinese people, but some people were paralyzed by impure thoughts and thought that filial piety was outdated. At this time when morality urgently needs to be revitalized, it should be corrected and paid attention to.

Regarding the second point, I think it is even more important, because my country has a very short history of parental education, and most people do not know how to be parents. They cannot understand what the relationship between parents and children should ultimately be. Therefore, there cannot be a harmonious life between parents and children, which becomes a great obstacle to the work of managing the family.

The third point, relieving distressed parents, is of course a passive move, but for the sake of the entire society, being able to use extra strength to engage in relief can also promote the happiness of general families and make the entire social order more perfect.
