### National Troops Advance to the Outskirts of Changchun; Communist Troops Retreat Towards Jilin Last Night; Deputy Chief of Staff Bai Departs Shenyang by Plane to Transfer to Beijing

[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 22nd] Xiong Shihui and Du Yuming jointly hoped that the Chinese Communists would voluntarily withdraw from Changchun and Andong via telegram, but the Central News Agency has yet to broadcast it. It is generally speculated that this is to avoid provoking the Chinese Communists and affecting the Nanjing negotiations. The telegram was sent from Shenyang on the 20th. Xiong and Du's proposed solution to the Northeast problem in the telegram was: "As long as the Communist Party troops abide by the agreements such as cessation of military conflict and troop reorganization, voluntarily withdraw from Andong and Changchun and other places already received by our government, and withdraw from the Zhenkou railway line, prioritize restoring transportation, and allow the three-person group or the Executive Headquarters to be responsible for mediation."

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 22nd] At 12:00 AM on the 22nd, an urgent telegram from Fanjiatun reported that the National troops had approached the outskirts of Changchun. According to reports from the vanguard troops, the entire city of Changchun was dark, with the power supply clearly cut off. At dusk on the 22nd, the Communist troops had already begun to retreat towards Jilin.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 22nd] Deputy Chief Bai recently went to Sipingjie with Commander Du, Deputy Chief Liang, and the Military Affairs Department to inspect. He returned to Shenyang this morning and departed Shenyang by plane this afternoon with Director Li Jiaolong to transfer to Beijing.

[United Press, Beiping, 22nd] Today, authoritative sources here reported that one of the five columns of National troops advancing towards Changchun had outflanked the main Communist forces at Gongzhuling and engaged them in battle.

[United Press, Nanjing, 22nd] The Ministry of Military Affairs announced that National troops had recovered Gongzhuling between Changchun and Sipingjie yesterday, and recovered Xi'an, 37 miles east of Sipingjie, and Chaoyangpo (transliteration), 7 miles from the city. National troops are currently gathering in Yitong, 26 miles east of Gongzhuling, and are advancing towards Liusangzi (transliteration), the second station town behind Gongzhuling, 50 miles from the final target, Changchun.

[United Press, Shenyang, 22nd] A military dispatch received here last night reported that National troops are advancing towards Changchun in five routes. The Central Route of the New First Army entered Gongzhuling at 7:00 PM last night, which is 120 li south of Changchun. The vanguard troops of the National Army are pursuing the retreating Communist troops and have reached 21 li north of Gongzhuling. The Western Route of the National Army has reached Zhujadian and Liaoyang, and the Eastern Route has reached 90 li east of Gongzhuling. The Southeastern Route has recovered Xi'an, 120 li east of Sipingjie.

### Communist Troops Reinforce Ping-Sui Railway, Threaten to Attack Nankou

[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 22nd] Official sources report that Communist troops are reinforcing the Huairou-Changping area in the middle of the Ping-Gu and Ping-Sui Railways. Yesterday, five regiments arrived in Ma Ling and Heng Ling, which are under the jurisdiction of Huairou County. The Communist representative in the Military Mediation Department openly stated that the Communist troops were preparing to attack Nankou on the Ping-Sui Railway for some reason. A new regiment of Communist troops has arrived at Qiaozicun, 10 li west of Huairou County seat, preparing for the attack.

[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 22nd] Conflicts near Beiping are gradually escalating. A person from Xixiang today said that there are sporadic conflicts in the Xishan area. However, the 33rd group of the Executive Headquarters, originally intended to be dispatched to mediate the conflicts near Beiping, has not yet departed today due to entanglement in the Jehol mediation dispute, and there is no definite date for departure. This group was expanded from Executive Headquarters personnel responsible for inspecting the periphery of Beiping. The government representative is Lieutenant Colonel Li Jingjun, the Communist representative is Lieutenant Colonel Song Shaode, and the American representative is Colonel Mali. The original inspection route was to go to Anci and Panggezhuang for mediation first, and then transfer to Huailai for inspection. It is now unknown when it will be possible to depart. The military conflict north and south of the ancient capital is currently intense. It is said that 2,000 peasant soldiers were captured after Anci. Official sources claim that the strength of the National troops is sufficient to consolidate the security of Beiping, Tianjin, and Baoding.

### Military Three-Person Group Preparing to Reconvene

[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 22nd] The Military Mediation Department received a long-distance call from Nanjing yesterday, stating that the Military Three-Person Group is preparing to reconvene.

### Strengthening Mediation Efforts; Agreement Not Yet Signed

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 22nd] It is reported that Special Envoy Marshall, given the frequent difficulties encountered in implementing mediation work, believes that the authority of the Executive Group must be strengthened and its prestige should be increased. He recently consulted with Zheng Jiemin, the government representative who flew in from Beiping, American representative Robertson, and representatives from both the KMT and the CCP at the three-person conference, and obtained five supplementary measures, which have been seen in previous reports. This agreement was originally intended to be issued under Order Hezi No. 7, but it was temporarily shelved because the CCP representative in the Three-Person Committee was unwilling to sign it. It is widely believed that Marshal Marshall's two-hour talk with Zhou Enlai on the 21st was related to this matter.

### City Security Well-Ensured; National Troops in Jinan Await Mediation; Zhou Zhirou Arrived in Jinan Yesterday for Inspection

[Our Correspondent in Jinan, 22nd] The Communist troops deliberately tore up the ceasefire order and have recently mobilized large armies from various places in an attempt to invade Jinan in four routes. In order to strictly abide by the ceasefire agreement, the National troops have always been patient and await the Executive Group to conduct mediation in order to turn hostility into friendship. However, the authorities have taken thorough measures for the security of Jinan City, ensuring that there will be no danger.

[Our Correspondent in Jinan, 22nd] Director Zhou Zhirou of the Aeronautics Committee arrived in Jinan by air today for inspection.

[Our Correspondent in Jinan, 22nd] More than a thousand Communist troops from Jiyang attacked Shijiawu, 40 li northeast of Jinan and north of the Yellow River, on the 21st. They encountered National troops at 4:00 AM, and the battle was still in progress until late evening.

[Our Correspondent in Jinan, 22nd] According to military sources, approximately 30,000 Communist troops of unknown designation recently landed in Yantai via sea from the Northeast and are currently crossing Pingdu, pressing towards Weixian.

[Our Correspondent in Jinan, 22nd] It is reported that the Communist troops in Shandong Province have ordered the registration of all green crops in various counties, townships, and towns. Once the wheat is ripe and the autumn harvest is over, they will implement a system of grain allocation based on population, with each person receiving one and a half catties of new grain per day, and the remainder will be confiscated for military use.

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 22nd] According to a certain government official who told our reporter, Jinan has been surrounded by Communist troops for more than half a year. Recently, the Shandong Communist troops received secret orders from Yan'an to launch a widespread offensive and have been shrinking the encirclement of Jinan on the east, west, and south sides since last week, attacking the provincial capital. Their intention is clearly to support the Communist troops in Changchun, who are on the verge of collapse, in order to save their inevitable defeat. It is remembered that when the Communist responsible person issued intimidating propaganda last week, he said that if the government insisted on recovering Changchun, once the Changchun Communist troops failed, the Communist Party would launch an offensive elsewhere to compensate for the losses of the Northeast Communist troops. This shows that the Communist military conspiracy to expand the civil war has been premeditated for a long time. The current siege of Jinan is also their usual tactic of attacking in the east and west. Judging from the recent provocative actions of the Communist troops on the Jiaoji, Jinpu, Pingsui, BeiNing, and Tongpu railways, as well as in northern Anhui and northern Jiangsu, it can be seen that the Communist Party's goal is not limited to Jinan alone. The government is now deeply aware of the suffering of Special Envoy Marshall in mediating a comprehensive peace and respects the statement made by Marshall the other day calling on both sides to stop the propaganda war. It does not want to comment much on the Communist atrocities, but it fears that it will no longer be able to tolerate the Communist military conspiracy to expand the civil war to various parts of China, regardless of the destruction of national vitality and the sacrifice of the lives and property of the people. The situation is facing a crucial juncture. It is hoped that the Communist Party will pull back from the brink and quickly stop its attempt to besiege Jinan in order to thank the people of the country.

### Situation in Jehol Gradually Stabilizing; Mediation Work Difficult to Start Currently

[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 22nd] Official sources state that National troops have arrived in Jehol as reinforcements, and the situation is gradually stabilizing. However, the mediation work of the Military Mediation Department is still difficult to start. Official sources claim that the groups dispatched by the Executive Headquarters to Chengde and Chifeng lost their freedom of work and movement before the Communist troops launched their offensive. In order to restore their peace work, the Executive Headquarters sent Colonel Zhu Jiewu (government), Major General Li Jukui (Communist) and an American representative to Chengde on the 19th to negotiate with senior Communist generals. However, after they arrived, the Communist representative Li Jukui refused to meet with the government and American representatives, resulting in the suspension of the negotiation. The Executive Headquarters is very anxious about this.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 22nd] Jin County News: The Communist troops occupying Beipiao suddenly began to withdraw on the evening of the 18th.

### Communist Troops Shell Tai'an; Defending Troops Did Not Retaliate; Abiding by Ceasefire Order

[Our Correspondent in Jinan, 22nd] Communist troops in Tai'an and Yanzhou are moving frequently, and the stationed troops have been repeatedly shot at, suffering casualties. The 123rd Regiment of the 1st Brigade of the 4th Division of the New Fourth Army, led by Liao Zhengguo, with approximately 3,000 troops, fled north from near Yanzhou. More than 2,000 of them forced the people of An station on the 16th and constructed fortifications in an attempt to launch an offensive. Zhang Zhenwu, commander of the Luzhong Military Region of the Communist Army, led more than 7,000 troops and arrived in the area 30 li east and west of Tai'an on May 15. On the evening of the 16th, they fled to the area south of Wand and on the border of Tai'an and Fei counties. On the 15th, the Communist troops also fired two mortar shells at the positions of the defending troops in the west gate of Tai'an. The shells fell in empty areas, and we suffered no casualties. The defending troops strictly abided by the orders and did not retaliate.

[United Press, Our Correspondent] General Gillen, commander of the U.S. forces stationed in China, said that the Moscow broadcast that American planes had been shot down in the Northeast was "very suspicious."

### Shao Lizi Tells Our Reporter: Situation May Improve; Cessation of Propaganda War to be Implemented

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 22nd] The current situation has reached a critical juncture of rapid change. Halting the spread of the war inside the customs, and the cessation of the propaganda war between the KMT and the CCP is about to be put into action. Tonight, Shao Lizi, in his busy schedule, received our reporter with an unusual smile. He said: "First, resolve the Changchun issue, then talk about other issues.

### Changchun Twenty-Nine Days (5)

— By Our Special Correspondent Shao Shenzhi

Heavy Artillery and Tanks Attack the Bank of China

This is the last battle situation of the Central Bank, which Shenzhi personally experienced.

On the afternoon of the 17th, Zhu Zhou drove Mayor Zhao, Beckett, Ebner, Shixun, Zhuo Zhi and the other five back to their residences. Surprisingly, he drove back to the Central Bank. Shenzhi was waiting for the driver to return. He saw him running into the basement in a sweat, saying that the situation outside was that the car could not go out anyway.

From then on, all external transportation of the Central Bank was completely cut off. Shenzhi liked to wander around. Although bullets were flying, he went to the Central Bank twice a day. He had a special philosophy, thinking that if bullets could find you, they could find you anywhere. Now that he was stuck in the Central Bank and unable to move, Zhu Zhou said to him: "You are destined to live in the Central Bank." He had nothing to say.

We sent out the last English telegram that day. After we arrived in Changchun, we sent telegrams to the Central News Agency and the two newspapers every day. We still don't know if they were completely received.

The ammunition delivered this time was all 79 rifle bullets, which were of the wrong caliber and completely useless. The defending troops were happy for a while in vain, and the situation became urgent due to the loss of the State Council and Mantan. As usual, the Communist troops attacked once at dawn and once in the evening these past two days. On the 16th, a shell landed at the Sanzhongi Yoko Company three meters north of the Central Bank, and more than a dozen shells landed on Datong Square. This was clearly aimed at the Central Bank, but the Central Bank had not been hit by a single one yet. Tonight, shells may start to hit.

The State Council caught fire after being shelled, so the defending troops had to retreat. The defending troops have been in contact for six days since the 12th. The Security Team has never retaken the lost strongholds, and the battle line is shrinking. Yesterday, the northwest corner of the New Imperial Palace and the Imperial Household Ministry were abandoned. At noon today, the State Council was abandoned. During the evening attack by the Communist troops, the Museum, Telegraph Office, Baishan Park, and Datong Park area were also abandoned. The defending troops on the north retreated to Fengle Road, and the defending troops on the south retreated to the Xiehe Guild Hall (formerly the Soviet Army Command), the Municipal Government, and the Police Department.

At this time, many civil servants were discussing the issue of breaking through the siege. They proposed it to Chen Jiazhen, but Chen did not intend to do so.

Although the gunfire was very dense on the morning of the 18th, it was not a fierce battle compared to the previous days. The Central Bank was becoming more and more crowded. The wounded came here for medical treatment, and those who had not eaten for several days hoped to get some food here. However, there was no so-called rear here. Thousands of people were crammed in, and there was artillery fire outside. These problems were not easy to solve.

At noon, the Communist troops adjusted their heavy artillery positions and bombarded the Central Bank, the Municipal Government, and the Dongtuo Building from the east and west. Fires broke out everywhere. The Municipal Government was hit with rocket shells, and it was clear that incendiary bombs were being used. This was the beginning of the general attack. Communist tanks also came out, driving from the direction of the railway station and stopping at the entrance of the Daxing Company. The tanks coming from the south stopped at the entrance of the Xiehe Guild Hall. No one knew that the Communist troops had tanks. It was unimaginable that the Communist troops would use tanks. According to reports, a Japanese tank driver was killed, but we could not see the body at this time.

Although the Central Bank was very strong, it was still shaking. The Communist troops dragged explosive packs to the side of the building and detonated them. One heavy mortar shell fell on the roof. Some shells broke through the glass windows and exploded inside.

At this time, the plane delivering ammunition came and circled above. The Communist fire temporarily weakened and did not fire machine guns at it desperately as it did yesterday. However, after it was identified as a transport plane, the shells continued to be fired. Most of the ammunition delivered that day fell into Datong Park and was all carried away by the Communist troops.

The Municipal Government had already caught fire, and the rear of the Central Bank also caught fire. The battle reached its climax. The battle was in the Datong Square area. The Central Bank fought to the end because it had a generator, so there were still lights and water. Although there were several fires, it was easy to put them out. The fire in the Municipal Government and Dongtuo Building was getting bigger and bigger.

Shenzhi still wanted to climb to the roof to take a look, but he could not do it anyway. The soldiers on the upper floors also crowded into the basement. Shells and bullets were flying around in the building.

At this time, Chen Jiazhen began to discuss how to break through the siege.

As mentioned above, this matter had been proposed on the 17th, and many people had already prepared for it, because it seemed that there was nothing else to do but fight until completely annihilated. In fact, it had reached the point where ammunition was exhausted and assistance was cut off. Documents and codes began to be burned, and the radio station began to be destroyed. Therefore, when the plane came this afternoon, there was no way to contact it. The Central Bank only had a small radio station from the Ministry of Communications to report to Shenyang.

### The Current National Situation Has Reached a Critical Stage; The Government's Policy Remains Unchanged; Hoping the Communist Party Will Leave a Glimmer of Hope for the Nation

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] This newspaper's reporter has been frequently meeting with people from all walks of life, both Chinese and foreign, in the capital these past few days. The conversations often touch upon the current national situation. The impressions gained can be summarized as follows: The general public's concerns regarding the current national situation revolve around two major issues: politics and economics. These two major issues are, in fact, a single, purely political problem. Overcoming the current economic difficulties hinges not only on economics itself. Factors such as the destruction of transportation infrastructure and the instability of the current situation are all contributing factors, both factual and psychological, to the obstruction of production and the rise in prices. Therefore, since the victory last autumn, the government has repeatedly compromised in an attempt to seek complete accommodation, holding political consultations, reorganizing the government, increasing the number of National Assembly representatives, etc., all in an effort to find a peaceful resolution to the problem. Only in this way can national transportation be restored, local order be stabilized, and the path to economic construction be embarked upon, truly reaping the rewards of the victory in the War of Resistance. Unfortunately, the Communist Party has consistently lacked sincerity, especially regarding the Northeast handover issue, further violating the ceasefire order. Therefore, those third parties, our Allied friends, who previously held high hopes for negotiation, now, while still expressing optimism verbally, have gained a new understanding of the true face of the Communist Party in their hearts. However, the above does not mean that the current political problem has reached a stage where a peaceful resolution is impossible. Some individuals have specifically pointed out that the government's consistent policy remains unchanged to this day. The crux of the problem lies in whether the Communist Party still possesses a national consciousness and is willing to leave a glimmer of hope for the nation and its people. However, this requires concrete action. Currently, what all parties are hoping for from the Communist Party is, first, that the handover of Changchun in the Northeast will not repeat the mistakes of Sipingjie. The key to reopening peace talks lies in this. Second, that military actions will not be expanded to various parts of Guannei, which would only complicate the situation and be of no help in reality, and would certainly not be a way to resolve the problem. As for the government, all parties believe that those in power should be responsible for the nation. This responsibility lies not only in the present but also must take into account the historical criticism of future generations for thousands of years. The indecisive style of decision-making, if continued for a long time, is something the people can no longer endure. This reporter has silently observed that some individuals within the government seem to share this sentiment. The current situation has reached a decisive stage.

### The Resources Committee Establishes a Petroleum Company in Shanghai to Unify the Management of Petroleum Operations; Initial Construction Expected to be Completed Within Three Years

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] Regarding the Resources Committee's establishment of the China Petroleum Co., Ltd., the person in charge of the Committee recently issued the following statement: Petroleum is of great importance to national defense and people's livelihood. Therefore, the governments of all countries pay close attention to petroleum operations. China's petroleum operations are still in their infancy and urgently need to be strengthened and actively promoted. China's Mining Law officially stipulates that oil mines should be state-owned. The Resources Committee, as its duty lies, established the China Petroleum Co., Ltd. on the 18th of this month to unify the management of the production, refining, transportation, and sales of petroleum operations in China. The Resources Committee's original petroleum organizations, such as the Gansu Oil Mine Bureau, the Sichuan Oil Mine Exploration Office, as well as the Taiwan Oil Mine, the Shanghai Refinery, the Jinzhou and Juexi Refineries, and the oil grain storage and transportation facilities in various places, which were recently taken over in the recovered areas, will all be incorporated into the company. It is expected that initial construction can be completed within three years. In Gansu, production and refining will be given equal importance. In Taiwan, attention will be paid to purchasing foreign crude oil for refining. At the same time, exploration work on oil fields in Gansu, Qinghai, Sichuan, and Taiwan provinces will also be intensified. It is planned to invite a well-known American engineering company to assist in the implementation of the above work. Weng Wenhao will serve as the chairman of the company. Sun Yueqi, Wu Zhaohong, Xu Benchun, and Sun Zheng have been appointed as directors. The company's location will be in Shanghai for the convenience of contact with all parties.

### The Truth About the Communist Party's Destruction of Postal Services; Relevant Authorities of the Ministry of Communications Speak to Reporters

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] In recent months, there have been repeated reports of the Communist Party dividing postal services, destroying postal services, and issuing stamps in various places. Yesterday, this reporter made a special visit to the relevant authorities of the Ministry of Communications to inquire about the truth. According to their statement: Before the victory of the War of Resistance, the Communist Party had blocked postal routes and interfered with postal services, but the formal division of postal rights and the destruction of the postal system began after the victory. The Communist Party's destruction of the postal system takes the following six forms: (1) Unauthorized establishment of postal organizations, with different names in different places. For example, those in the Hebei-Beiping and Henan postal districts are called "Transportation Bureau," those in the Shandong postal district are called "War Postal Bureau," and those in northern Jiangsu are called "Huaibei Border Area Transportation Bureau," which are "under the jurisdiction of the Commissioner's Office." In addition, there are postal administration bureaus in Zunhua and Hejian, and "transportation stations" in various places in northern Jiangsu. Although the names are different, they all openly operate postal services and deliver mail. (2) Unauthorized issuance of stamps. According to investigations, the Communist Party has issued at least three types of stamps. One is the stamp issued in Yantai with a photograph of Mao Zedong, the second is the "Anti-Currency" stamp issued in the Qidong and Haimen areas of Jiangsu, and the third is the "Mengjiang Stamp" issued in Yixian, Hebei. (3) Taking over existing post offices. As of now, although there is no detailed investigation or statistics on the number of postal offices that have been taken over in the Jiangsu, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, and Beiping postal districts, it is believed that there are at least more than two hundred. Most of the takeovers took place after December 1945. (4) Detaining postal employees. It has been investigated and confirmed that the directors and employees of the bureaus in Chengxian, Qingxian, Gaoyang, Handan, Xiuwu, Yantai, and other places total more than three thousand people. (5) Blocking postal routes. (6) Forcing all postal employees to withdraw within a specified period. Based on the above facts, the article "On the Postal Problem in the Communist Area" written by Mr. Chen Guangzhao and published in the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao on the 7th of this month, which stated that because the postal service withdrew from the Communist area, giving the people and the Communist Party an excuse, the Communist Party's "Transportation Bureau" had to expand its organization and replace it, is contrary to the facts. For example, the takeover of the Yantai Post Office took place on August 26, 1945, and the takeover of the post offices in various counties in eastern Hebei took place in December of this year. Before this, the post offices in these places had not withdrawn. Furthermore, the Communist Party's replacement of postal personnel, blockade of postal routes, and illegal issuance of stamps not only did not provide convenience to the people but also inconvenienced them. As for the attitude towards this matter, in short, there are two points: (1) The postal organization should maintain its consistent unity, and there should be absolutely no destruction or division. The establishment of the postal service aims to serve the people and should not be changed due to changes in the political situation. Therefore, in the past, during many civil wars, there was never any "takeover" of the postal service. Even during the enemy-puppet period, it was able to abide by the international postal conventions and maintain the inherent system of the postal service. Now, the Communist Party's unauthorized establishment of organizations and issuance of stamps not only destroys the postal system but also violates the spirit of the international postal conventions and the postal law. If it is said that the postal offices in the "liberated areas" have not been universally established, and the Communist Party has had to resort to this strategy, then as long as the Communist Party can provide convenience and guarantee, this Ministry is willing to universally establish them according to their needs. (2) The postal personnel system should maintain its independent spirit and should not be destroyed by selecting people for positions. The appointment of postal personnel, "senior personnel are examined by the Examination Yuan, and intermediate personnel are authorized by the Higher Examination Yuan to be handled by the various regional administration bureaus." There is absolutely no such thing as selecting people for positions or seeking advancement by flattery. This has been the most sound personnel system in our country for decades. However, after the Communist Party took over the postal offices in various places, they have been appointing personnel one after another, even promoting mail carriers to directors, which not only destroys the sound personnel system but also will create a trend of seeking advancement by flattery.

### Shen Honglie Returns to Hangzhou; Will Inspect Western Zhejiang Again

[Central News Agency, Washington, 21st] UNRRA Director La Guardia is expected to submit a proposal to the United Nations today to abolish the agency. Officials of the agency said that Truman's food envoy Hoover had suggested establishing a new United Nations agency that includes the powers of UNRRA. La Guardia expressed his agreement. Before delivering a speech at the World Food Conference convened by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, he may announce in that speech his support for transferring the agency's powers to the United Nations. La Guardia has ordered his staff to prepare for the termination plan to be submitted to the agency's board meeting in August. He told his assistants that this work is still needed globally after being transferred to a permanent organization. The agency's legal existence in Europe will end in June, and in China, it can continue until March of next year.

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 22nd] George Muller wrote in the "Hong Kong China Mail" that speculation in UNRRA goods in Shanghai "seriously hinders the work of UNRRA and constitutes a threat to the territorial integrity of the Chinese government." He also said: "The unconstrained buying and selling behavior of speculators in various ports of China has forced UNRRA to stop its low-priced sales of relief goods. The Ming government is seeking a plan to save face and take back its distribution rights from Chinese officials. The public funds for flour are almost entirely obtained by employees and relatives of black market merchants, and speculators interfere with UNRRA shipments to various ports along the Yangtze River." Muller also said that before February 1, only 30,000 tons of the 200,000 tons of relief goods were shipped out of Shanghai, but by March 22, the amount shipped out of the 247,000 tons of relief goods had increased to 146,000 tons, mainly because the transportation work was entrusted to the US Navy.

The main points of the questions and answers are recorded below: Q: What is the latest situation regarding the negotiations on the Soviet Union's removal of factory equipment from the nine northeastern provinces? Vice Minister Liu replied: The Chinese government has reiterated that the Japanese industrial equipment in the nine northeastern provinces cannot be regarded as war booty and given to the Soviet Union. As of now, this issue has not been resolved. Q: Did the Soviet Union request punishment for the killing of 18 Soviet citizens in Changchun? Vice Minister Liu replied: Some time ago, the Soviet ambassador protested to our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting an investigation into this case. The Chinese government has ordered a detailed investigation into this matter, but the issue of responsibility for this case is still unclear. Q: What is the main reason for General He Yingqin's transfer? Minister Peng replied: I would like to ask you to review the report made by General He at his headquarters press conference on May 9 regarding this matter. Q: If Changchun is recovered by the government, does the National Army plan to advance and recover Harbin? Minister Peng replied: It is the responsibility of the National Government to take over the entire Northeast, but if it can be resolved peacefully, the government sincerely wishes for it. Q: Does the Minister believe that if the National Army directly attacks Changchun, it will cause the Communist Army in the Northeast and other parts of North China to retaliate? Minister Peng replied: We hope that the Communist Army will voluntarily withdraw from Changchun. The government has never wanted to use force. Q: Is there any more detailed confirmation about the rumors that Chairman Chiang will visit the United States? Minister Peng replied: Regarding this matter, I have nothing to say except for the speech made by the Chairman himself in Shanghai. Q: Are there any plans to separate the Central News Agency from the government? Minister Peng replied: The Central News Agency is planning to reorganize into an independent organization, and I am willing to fully support this matter. Q: What is your department's reaction to Marshal Marshall's recent statement? Minister Peng replied: We admire the efforts of Marshal Marshall and his staff, and Marshal Marshall will certainly receive our sincere cooperation. Q: For the sake of a peaceful future, if the Communist Party agrees to do the same, is your department willing to issue an order requiring all newspapers in the country to stop reporting rumors and sentiments that may be harmful? Minister Peng replied: This department has encouraged all newspapers in the country to ensure that all editorials and news are accurate and truthful. We will continue to advise all newspapers, including Communist Party publications, not to violate this principle. Q: Does the government still control the buying and selling of newspapers? Minister Peng replied: No, the government does not control this at all.

Lu Zhixing, a thirteen-year-old student at Lianxi Elementary School in the west gate of this city, was heading to school after lunch when suddenly a convoy of over ten military trucks from the 1st Company, 1st Battalion of the 24th Regiment sped towards him. The student quickly sought refuge under the eaves. The first three trucks passed without incident, but the driver of the fourth truck was careless and struck Lu's leg with the front wheel. He fell to the ground, and his head was run over by the rear wheel, killing him instantly. The driver, realizing the accident, disregarded the shouts of bystanders and the student's parents, accelerating to escape. Police officers, upon hearing the news, attempted to stop him, but he resisted with force, nearly resulting in a physical altercation. Only when personnel from the county government arrived was the driver, Sergeant Zheng Jian, taken into custody and will be prosecuted.

Murderer Who Strangled Rival in Love Arrested

Liu Adai, a nineteen-year-old girl from Yaogang, about one mile outside the north gate of this city, is reasonably attractive. In October of last year, she became involved with Tianhuo Zhou Changqing. The two were secretly intimate and quite fond of each other. Recently, a neighbor named Ji Yibin (23 years old) became enamored with the girl's beauty and sought to have his way with her. Soon, he succeeded. Zhou, upon learning of this, was resentful and plotted to get rid of his rival. On the night of the 14th of this month, Zhou Changqing returned to the girl's house for a secret rendezvous. Ji Yibin, learning of this, decided to strike first. He gathered Qian Yulin and Zhu Xiaohuaizi and went to catch them in the act. Zhou Changqing was unable to escape and cried for help. Ji Yibin, fearing exposure, was seized by murderous intent. He strangled Zhou with a rope, tied a large stone to his body, and dumped it into the river. Several days later, Zhou's father, not seeing his son return, searched everywhere and learned that Ji and others were suspected. He reported this to the detective team, who arrested Ji for interrogation. Ji confessed to the crime, admitting that he initially dumped the body in Gangzhong, but moved it on the night of the 16th to the nearby Shizi Gang.

Jiaxing

Cocoon Factories Open, Dates Set

The silkworms in Jiaxing's four rural areas have largely passed the dormant stage, and the early ones have reached the stage of spinning silk. However, due to weather conditions, only 20-30% of the silkworms are producing silk. Inspecting mulberry trees in rural areas, the leaves are still on the trees. According to silkworm farmers, this situation is unprecedented in decades. Cocoon merchants, hearing this news, have also tightened their cocoon purchasing plans. Surveys show that out of the originally planned twenty factories to be opened, only about ten have decided to open. Some rural areas are hesitant due to security concerns. Recently, the local silk cocoon industry association has held a meeting of silk cocoon merchants to discuss issues such as security and taxes. These issues have not yet been resolved and will require another meeting to decide. The opening date for cocoon purchase is set for the 25th of this month in Jianan, and the 26th of this month in Jiabei. The cocoon price is temporarily set at 100,000 yuan per market dan, and further negotiations with silk factories are scheduled for the 24th to increase the price as much as possible.

Commentary

### Arise, Ye Who Refuse to Be Slaves!

— Xie Yunyi

"Arise, ye who refuse to be slaves!" This is the tragic song cried out by the late Mr. Nie Er, the Chinese national composer, for the liberation of the Chinese nation at a time when the Chinese nation was facing a life-or-death crisis. When the late Mr. Nie Er composed this song, it was after the "Mukden Incident," when Japan was stepping up its aggression against China; "Ye who refuse to be slaves" are those who refuse to be Japanese slaves! After eight years of arduous struggle, the Chinese nation, inspired by Nie Er's song, rose up and finally overthrew Japan's warlords and their aggression. In the past eight years, Yunnan, Nie Er's hometown, has been our important base of resistance and the lifeline of our nation. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, the Japanese warlords have been defeated; Nie Er, knowing this in the Pacific, would surely be smiling with joy. However, the crises facing the Chinese nation are even more serious than those Nie Er faced in his day; we have defeated Japan, but we are facing an even more serious crisis of national life and death. At that time, it was an overt crisis of national life and death, but now it is seemingly intangible and tangible, or seemingly intangible but tangible, and precisely because of this, it is more "dangerous" and more serious than the "most dangerous time" back then; this national singer, knowing this in the afterlife, would not hesitate to cry out again the magnificent cry of "Arise! Ye who refuse to be slaves!"

What is this more dangerous time? The war against Japan has been won, and the National Government has returned to the capital in triumph; but from the Northeast and Rehe to northern Jiangsu, war is still going on, the transportation on the national railway trunk lines has not yet been restored, and the prices of grain and even general commodities across the country are rising steadily, making people's lives increasingly difficult. How did this situation come about? Any objective observer would unanimously point out that it is due to the disruption and destruction of the Communist Party. In order to take into account the post-war hardship of people's livelihood and the necessity of China's unification, the government has not hesitated to compromise and seek peace, and sincerely negotiated with the CCP and other parties and non-party members, hoping that the negotiations would be fruitful, and China could be at peace, transportation could be restored, and wars could be stopped, in order to devote ourselves to the development of national construction. However, just as the negotiations were about to succeed, dark clouds gathered again, and war broke out again. Not only was transportation not restored, but the destruction of roads became even more intense. The facts before our eyes clearly indicate that all of this is due to the actions of the CCP, and the CCP should bear full responsibility. Some frivolous politicians are calling for both sides to cease fighting, which is tantamount to supporting the destruction of the CCP, assisting the wicked, and abetting evildoers. Some citizens, without making a judgment, are dissatisfied with the government's current policies and are echoing them from afar, and their impact is enough to shake the foundation of the country. If this situation is not corrected, not only will our eight years of hard struggle be in vain, but it will even make our nation slaves; by that time, it will be too late to regret. This is another critical moment for the survival of our nation, and at this time, we must re-propose the call of "Arise, ye who refuse to be slaves!"

Indeed, the government's current policies have things that make us dissatisfied, but we cannot transfer our loyalty to the government because we are not satisfied with the government's policies. Grain prices have risen to nearly 70,000, and people's livelihoods are deteriorating. It is true that this is due to the government's failure to take appropriate measures, but if we investigate the current economic crisis, we can find that the reason why the economic danger has not been reduced or even resolved is partly due to the government's improper measures, but the main reason is the current political environment in the country. The Communist Party destroys transportation, making it impossible for goods to flow smoothly. In the areas controlled by the Communist Party, "anti-currency" is issued, making the currency system even more chaotic, making it even more difficult for the government to consolidate the already inflated currency, and making prices rise step by step. In order to take into account the post-war hardship of people's livelihood, the government is eager to carry out post-war reconstruction, so it has not hesitated to compromise; hoping that the whole country will be united to relieve the people from their suffering. However, this good intention of the government has been sabotaged by the Communist Party, making it impossible for the government to actively launch various measures to promote people's well-being and start anew, and turning the current economic crisis into a serious one. Therefore, the Communist Party should be held responsible for the formation of this situation.

This is a strategy of the Communist Party, to make China uneasy, to deepen China's economic crisis, to expand the destruction of China's transportation system, to make the government more difficult, and then it hopes to get more people to be its slaves and to build its ideal socialist Soviet China. The pursuit of ideals is human nature; it is not uncommon to be dissatisfied with the current policies and be self-intoxicated with unrealized ideals. Using this political and psychological capital, the Communist Party calls for "democracy," calls for "socialist construction," and calls for "New China." The "democracy" under the Soviet system insults Mr. "De," and we do not need to point this out. As for "New China," the "New Republic of China" under the Communist Party's rule will no longer be China, and will turn our entire China into the "Manchukuo" after the "September 18 Incident," becoming someone else's puppet. China will have no national industry, and will join another "co-prosperity sphere" that is in progress. "Agricultural China" and "Industrial ××" will make our national economy have no day of development, and 450 million Chinese free people will be reduced to slaves. What a terrible strategy! Arise, ye who refuse to be slaves! Put our flesh and blood to defend our China!

The April issue of "Harper's" magazine published an article about the Soviet Union, which mentioned how the Soviet Union officially announced the implementation of the Fourth Five-Year Plan on the day Japan surrendered. According to this plan, by 1950, the Soviet Union must produce 35 million to 40 million tons of pure copper per year, actively expand its navy, establish strong naval bases in the Far East, and add merchant ships, etc. The reason why the Soviet Union implemented the Fourth Five-Year Plan, according to the published communique, is: "The Soviet Union must have the ability to supply the countries within the Soviet sphere of influence in Europe and Asia with capital equipment." Soviet political commentators believe that the Soviet Union's security will be threatened if its neighboring countries do not obtain capital goods from the Soviet Union; if the Soviet Union and its neighboring countries want to maintain close political cooperation, they must be based on a solid foundation, that is, close political cooperation must be based on close economic cooperation, and in economic cooperation, the Soviet Union must be the center. From the Baltic Sea to Korea, the Soviet Union must be the center of capital goods in this vast area. Isn't this a "co-prosperity sphere"? Knowing this, we know why the industrial and mining equipment in our Northeast must be moved away. In today's world where the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" has been defeated, there are countries attempting to build another new "co-prosperity sphere," and in our country, there are some "progressive elements" calling for "national liberation," attempting to drag us into another "co-prosperity sphere." Are we prepared to be slaves? Arise, ye who refuse to be slaves!

### Iran's Civil War Suddenly Stops; Disputes Over Iranian Issue Arise Again in the Security Council; Soviet Troops Have Indeed Completely Withdrawn from Azerbaijan

[Our Newspaper] London, 22nd - Broadcast: The Iranian Prime Minister declared: The war between the Iranian government forces and the Azerbaijani forces has ended, and the government expects the Azerbaijani issue to be resolved.

[Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 22nd - Broadcast: At today's meeting of the Security Council, after the Iranian representative presented a report, the US representative, Stettinius, stood up and declared: "This report is incomplete. The pressure currently exerted on Iran has not clearly diminished. Therefore, the Iranian issue should remain on the agenda." The British representative, Cadogan, expressed full agreement, but the Polish representative opposed it. It is said that since Iran has requested the Security Council to remove the country's issue from the agenda, the Security Council should accept it. It is regrettable that this has not been done. The Soviet representative has not yet attended.

[United Press International] Tehran, 21st - Iranian Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs and Director of Propaganda, Firoz, officially declared today: The delegation sent by the government to Azerbaijan to investigate the withdrawal of Soviet troops has completed its mission. After inspecting the main areas and cities recently occupied by Soviet troops in the country, it has submitted a report stating that all Soviet troops in the province have completely withdrawn on the specified date of May 6th. The government authorities have notified Ambassador Ardal in the United States of this matter today by telegram and ordered him to inform the United Nations Security Council. The British, American, and Soviet embassies in Iran have also officially received notification.

[Central News Agency] Tehran, 21st - United Press: Tabriz has been placed under martial law again, with reports suggesting "the situation has eased." The "Prime Minister" of the Azerbaijani government, Bishvari, recently told reporters that the Iranian representative, Ardal, attending the United Nations conference is a "traitor and criminal who should be promptly dismissed and investigated." According to various sources, although Soviet troops have withdrawn from Azerbaijan, the Soviet side and the Azerbaijani Democratic Government maintain close contact, providing spiritual support to the opposition of Azerbaijan against Tehran.

[Reuters] Tehran, 22nd - Yesterday, it was announced that the military governor of Tehran ordered the arrest of three former MPs: Hutti, Jamal, and Said. It is heard that this matter is related to Prime Minister Sadana's statement last Saturday that "reactionaries are spreading rumors of resignation." Sadana stated at the time that "in order to protect the national interest, we are determined to eliminate these pests."

### US Acknowledges Spain's Economic Strength Cannot Wage War Against Major Powers; Memorandum Submitted to the Security Council Has Been Published

[United Press International] New York, 21st - The memorandum submitted by the United States to the investigation committee on the Spanish issue of the United Nations Security Council was published tonight. It is said that Spain is economically unable to wage war against major powers, and the US has been unable to confirm the rumor that Spain is secretly researching atomic energy. The Spanish army currently lacks materials and trained personnel, and is unable to engage in modern warfare. Spain's potential for work warfare is also limited by a shortage of raw materials and industrial equipment, as well as transportation difficulties. In the event of war, it can only rely on its extremely simple and ordinary military equipment.

[French News Agency] New York, 21st - The memorandum submitted by the US government to the United Nations agency, explaining the state of Spain's national defense, said: Most of the defense fortifications built by Spain in the Pyrenees Mountains (bordering France) are improved bunkers. It is doubtful whether the effectiveness of these bunkers can withstand well-equipped troops. Spain has stationed approximately 150,000 troops along the French border, and 325,000 troops in other parts of the mainland and Spanish Morocco. According to the Spanish government, the country's air force has a total of 300 aircraft, of which 65% are fighter jets. The training level of the Spanish army is ranked second. As for the importance of local war materials, in 1943, only 700,000 tons of copper and iron were produced. The Spanish navy includes five cruisers, fourteen destroyers, and a small number of submarines.

[French News Agency] Mexico City, 21st - The Prime Minister of the Spanish Republican Government in exile, Giral, took a plane to New York today in response to a telegram from the Secretary-General of the United Nations agency, Lai. Giral's trip included a second batch of reports on the Spanish issue, including 600 official documents.

### Security Council Past Meetings Have Been Made into Gramophone Records

[United Press, New York, 21st] The proceedings of all past meetings of the United Nations Security Council have been completely made into gramophone records and sound films. Every word spoken in the meeting hall has therefore been preserved for future reference. The recording and filming device resembles a cross between a film camera and a portable radio receiver, similar to those used by wartime radio communicators and in the military to record battlefield sounds.

### Stalin to Make Historic Decisions on Foreign Policy, Indicating the Extent of Cooperation with Britain and the United States

[United Press, Washington, 22nd] Washington diplomatic authorities predict today that before the Council of Foreign Ministers reconvenes in Paris on June 15th, Soviet Premier Stalin and Foreign Minister Molotov will make several historic decisions regarding foreign policy. These decisions will influence the trends of the post-war world and determine the extent to which the Soviet Union will cooperate with Britain and the United States to maintain peace. The Kremlin is apparently close to a decision on the following three issues: (1) Do Soviet leaders consider it more important to maintain a long-term occupation of all of Eastern Europe, or will they conclude normal treaties with Eastern European countries to restore them to a peacetime basis? (2) Are they willing to resolve the Trieste dispute by not ceding the entire Trieste area to Yugoslavia? (Some officials believe Trieste has become a symbol of whether the Soviet Union can transport goods to friendly communist governments.) (3) Will Stalin dismiss Molotov's opposition to U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes' proposal for a four-nation treaty to control Germany for 25 years?

He will ask mine owners to negotiate a plan to ensure that all coal mines continue to operate under government supervision until an agreement is reached that is consistent with the wage and price stabilization policies. At the same time, the coal mine owners have jointly written to the President, guaranteeing full cooperation in continuing coal mining, but hoping to be given the opportunity to express their opinions on the labor contract mediated and signed by the government, and further hoping that the Office of Price Administration will raise the price ceiling for coal to compensate for the increase in miners' wages.

[This Newspaper's Report] San Francisco, 22nd Broadcast: According to the U.S. Department of State, President Truman has for the second time appealed to Stalin to provide some Russian grain to relieve the current world famine. The request was conveyed to the Soviet government by the U.S. Embassy in the Soviet Union.

The US made the request to the Soviet Union in mid-May, by which time the Soviet Union had already allocated considerable relief food to France and other countries, and was no longer able to bear the burden. Stalin replied that he did not object to this in principle, but that if the Soviet Union wanted to make a practical contribution, "special consideration" was still required.

[United Press, Washington, 21st] Republican Senator Vandenberg, the U.S. representative to the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference, declared to the Senate today that the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference has developed a "constructive and peace-seeking bipartisan foreign policy" for the United States. He did not explain the various difficulties encountered by the U.S. delegation at the meeting, as had been rumored, saying only that he wished to temporarily limit himself to what Secretary of State Byrnes announced in his broadcast last night. Vandenberg acknowledged that the Foreign Ministers' Conference failed to reach agreement on most major issues, but said that the conference had solidified U.S. policy to draft permanent peace treaties based on justice, not revenge. The United States' new bipartisan foreign policy not only calls for peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland, but also wants to conclude a treaty with Austria, whose status is close to the heart of the European continent's problems. Vandenberg also listed other goals of the U.S. bipartisan policy as follows:

(1) Resolve to unify Germany and abolish the current four military occupation zones. (2) Prevent the resurgence of Axis aggression as much as possible. (3) The peace plan must be based on justice and disarmament, not for the purpose of revenge. (4) National borders should be based on race, and no longer trade in the lives or destinies of helpless people. (5) Draft "people's peace treaties," with all United Nations participating in the discussion, not "secret great power cooperation."

Short Comment

### America's Peace Offensive

After returning from Paris, U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes delivered a broadcast address to the American people the day before yesterday, reporting on the failure of the recent Council of Foreign Ministers meeting. He emphasized the peace offensive adopted by the U.S. government, stating that the United States is determined to strive for political and economic peace in Europe, Asia, and the rest of the world, and must achieve this goal. The specific plan he proposed, in essence, is that if the next Council of Foreign Ministers meeting still fails to reach an agreement on convening a twenty-one-nation peace conference, then the United States will bring the matter to the United Nations General Assembly. Regardless of whether the Soviet Union agrees or not, the peace conference must be convened in the shortest possible time.

We have always admired Secretary of State Byrnes' efforts to promote and lay the foundation for world peace. We also agree with the new plan they have put forward. However, there is still a need for further explanation.

After the war, all countries in the world, especially the United States, hoped that the post-war world would enter a new era of democracy and peace. Through international cooperation, a century-long plan for world peace would be established. Unfortunately, international contradictions cannot be resolved, and each country's "sense of security" is different. Therefore, this hope is difficult to realize. The Five-Power Foreign Ministers' Meeting ended in discord last September, and the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Meeting failed this May. Even a peace conference cannot be convened. What international cooperation can be discussed? There is even less talk of lasting world peace. This is enough to prove that Byrnes' efforts for peace have failed and have reached a dead end. However, Byrnes is unyielding and still wants to take a peace offensive to achieve his goal. This spirit of fortitude and determination is truly admirable.

We study the international situation and deeply understand where the crux of the situation lies. In short, it is that there is no mutual trust and tolerance between Britain, America, and the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union believes that Britain and America's keeping the atomic bomb secret is a threat to the Soviet Union, so it accuses Britain and America of adopting a policy of power diplomacy. As for Britain and America, they attribute the responsibility for the failure of all post-war international conferences entirely to the Soviet Union's stubborn and unyielding attitude. Therefore, the two sides attack and slander each other endlessly. As a result, the international situation becomes increasingly chaotic.

Therefore, we believe that only if the next Foreign Ministers' meeting can unanimously agree to convene a European peace conference will there be hope of breaking the international deadlock. Otherwise, regardless of whether the Soviet Union participates or not, if Britain and America proceed to convene a peace conference, even if it is successful, it will be of no benefit to the future of world peace. Byrnes' speech the day before yesterday was a warning to all countries in the world. On the one hand, it urged the Soviet Union to realize its mistake and immediately change its attitude, agreeing to the British and American proposal to convene a peace conference this summer at the next Foreign Ministers' meeting. On the other hand, it showed that the United States has great determination for the peace offensive. Even if the Soviet Union does not participate, the United States will convene a peace conference and will not consider any consequences. If so, then the future development of the international situation will add a new factor. It is hoped that the American peace offensive can achieve final victory.

### British Tram Company Resumes Operations Today, Labor Disputes Resolved One by One, Director Wu and Zhu Xuefan Mediate to Reach Agreement, Customs Employees Resumed Work Yesterday

[Report from Our Newspaper] The labor disputes involving the British Tram Company, Jianghai Customs, the Western clothing industry, and others, which had been turbulent for many days, took a sharp turn yesterday and have become calm.

The British Tram Company decided to resume all operations starting today. All employees of Jianghai Customs also started working again at around 2:00 PM yesterday. The Western clothing industry also has news that it will resume operations starting today or tomorrow. These three labor disputes can be said to have come to an end. The details are reported as follows:

British Tram Company

Through the mediation of Wu Wenxian and Zhu Xuefan for several days, the employees resumed work yesterday afternoon and also dispatched several fixed-price trams. However, because the procedures for tickets, uniforms, etc. could not be completed in time, it was only able to officially resume operations today. Wu and Zhu both believe that this labor dispute was caused by the employer's unreasonable increase in the basic salary of employees. Zhu personally went to the Hart Road factory at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon to persuade and explain to all the employees. The employees requested that the company's move to increase the basic salary of employees be overturned, and that the fair method of seniority-based salary increases be restored, and that it should be implemented from March 1st. Zhu expressed his responsibility to negotiate with the company's authorities and respond within three weeks. In addition, because prices have soared in recent days, employees have requested a loan of 100,000 yuan per person to help with their urgent needs. Wu and Zhu also agreed to take responsibility for this. The employees also stated that in order to comply with government laws and regulations, they would stop the strike and be willing to sincerely negotiate with the employer to resolve the issue.

Jianghai Customs

Customs Director Zhang Fuyun temporarily approved the prepayment of one month's salary to all employees, which coincided with the employees' request for one month's relief fund. Therefore, the labor dispute, which had been deadlocked for many days, took a sharp turn. After hearing the news, all employees convened a meeting and immediately resumed work at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon, and everything returned to normal. According to Deputy Chief Inspector Ding Guitang, the funds required for the prepayment of one month's salary to all employees of Jianghai Customs are huge. We are currently borrowing from the Central Bank in order to raise the funds. As for the method of adjusting customs officers submitted to the Ministry of Finance a few days ago, approval has not yet been obtained.

Western Clothing Industry: After Zhu Xuefan took the post of mediator, the employees followed Zhu's advice and resumed work first. The labor union notified its members to prepare for the resumption of work. If they can catch up today, they will resume work today; otherwise, it will have to be postponed until tomorrow. At the same time, the Social Affairs Bureau also sent a letter to the employer's trade association, notifying them of the employees' resumption of work. Regarding the thirteen arrested employees, one has not yet been released. Zhu agreed to take responsibility for bail. As for the various conditions and the destruction of store names, Zhu will be responsible for negotiating with the employer to seek a solution. Yesterday, the labor union also hosted the press, reporting on the low wages of employees, so that the outside world could understand the truth. They also stated that they would resume work first and wait for a reasonable solution.

### Clerks and Recorders Who Borrowed a Month's Salary Resumed Work Today

[Report from Our Newspaper] More than 200 clerks and recorders from the city's High Court, District Court, and Prosecutor's Office, due to soaring prices and meager salaries, making it difficult to maintain a living, requested emergency relief from the judicial authorities and demanded an increase in salaries.

The presidents of the two courts approved the prepayment of one month's salary to each person, which means that they can receive one and a half months' salary at the end of this month. Therefore, it was decided that all clerks and recorders would resume work starting at 8:00 AM this morning.

Also, during the total leave yesterday, only Clerk Yang Daqi was firmly invited by Judge Liu Yugui to appear in court to handle official business out of consideration for Liu's face. Afterwards, feeling that he had violated the agreement with his colleagues, he resolutely submitted his resignation. However, it is reported that the authorities are making every effort to retain him.

### Yuan Ludeng's Retrial Held Again, His Son Submits a Petition Requesting Investigation of "Good Deeds," Court Orders Postponement of Debate After a Brief Interrogation

[Report from Our Newspaper] The High Court Special Criminal Tribunal originally scheduled the debate for Yuan Ludeng, one of the "Three Elders" of Shanghai, to begin yesterday afternoon. However, Yuan's family informed the defense lawyers Chen Tingrui, Li Baosen, and Chao Jimei in advance that Yuan was ill in prison and unable to stand trial and needed to be postponed for another hearing. Therefore, none of the defendant's defense lawyers were present when the court opened yesterday. When Yuan was escorted to the court by bailiffs, he was wearing a coffee-colored robe, black cloth shoes, gray socks, and black-rimmed glasses on his nose. His hair was already gray, and he looked very old, but his spirit was still good and his attitude was calm. He stated that the puppet rice control association had five Japanese members, including Ueta Kenjiro. His son, Yuan Senqi, submitted a petition requesting an investigation into Yuan's "good deeds" in Shanghai to prove that Yuan's defection did indeed benefit the people. The matters he requested to be investigated were three: (1) The price of rice purchased was indeed higher than before, (2) Efforts were made to maintain the distribution of household rice, and (3) Soup kitchens were established to relieve the poor. After Judge Xiao Xiefen briefly questioned him, he ordered a postponement of the debate.

Shao Hongzhu, 48 years old, worked at the Bank of Communications before the war. After the puppet government reorganized the bank after the occupation, Shao resigned and became unemployed. In January of the 30th year of the Republic (1941), he was introduced by his friend Ren Nidao to the puppet Central Reserve Bank, where he served as the deputy director of the Issuing Bureau. In February of the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), he was promoted to the puppet director, and under the orders of Zhou Fohai and Qian Tian, the "president" of the Central Reserve Bank, he was responsible for the receipt and payment of puppet currency, the allocation of funds, and the custody of reserves.

Gu Jiren, from Shanghai, 44 years old, resided at No. 8, Lane 119, Seymour Road. He ran a grain business before the war. Starting in September of the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), he was introduced by Chen Ziyi to the puppet rice control association and served as the deputy director of the Reserve Office. After one year and seven months, the puppet Reserve Office was merged into the puppet Business Office, and Gu was appointed as the deputy director of the Business Office. According to the High Prosecutor's Office, Gu supplied 2 million shi of military rice to the Deng troops and other enemy troops and 400,000 shi of military rice to puppet troops and police. He was prosecuted and, when the trial opened yesterday, Gu completely denied providing the enemy and puppet troops with rice. According to him, "What I did in the rice control association was to win back rice under the pretense of helping others and distribute it to the common people." He seemed very pleased with himself.

Sun Zuji, from Jiangsu, 47 years old, resided at No. 30, Mingcun, Wangxi Road. He graduated from the Law Department of Soochow University in the 18th year of the Republic (1929) and studied in the Philippines. Before the 20th year of the Republic (1931), he successively served as the section chief of the Jiangsu Civil Affairs Department, the magistrate of Wuxi County, and the counselor of the Hainan Provincial Government and the director of local administrative personnel education. Starting in the 21st year of the Republic (1932), he engaged in lawyer business in Shanghai, but later defected to the enemy, resulting in his arrest. When the court opened yesterday, the defendant hired lawyer Chen Tingrui to appear in court to defend him, claiming that he had not engaged in "work that betrayed this country and benefited the enemy and puppets." He also claimed that during his tenure as the puppet Finance Director of the Huaihai Province, he had exempted land taxes and reduced donations and taxes, and had reduced the increase in land taxes. During his tenure as the mayor of Hangzhou, he had raised winter clothes and set up factories in Guanzhen and at the site of the Sanqiao Bridge. He requested the court to summon witnesses Li Wenjie, Dong Hancha, and Deng Dongming to prove that he had not harmed merchants during his tenure as the puppet Insurance Supervision Bureau Director. The above three cases were all ordered to be retried on a later date.

### Huang Yuan Sentenced to Three Years

The High Court Special Criminal Tribunal sentenced Huang Yuan, the puppet Ministry of Finance secretary and the puppet Central Trust Company Board of Directors secretary and deputy general manager, to three years of imprisonment for disrupting the market and harming merchants and the people during his tenure in the puppet government. He was also deprived of his civil rights for three years, and all his property was confiscated, except for the necessary living expenses for his family. Liu Xingchen, the puppet Shanghai Municipal Commodity Distribution Director, Zhang Haoran, the puppet Incense and Candle Tax Bureau Director, and Tan Shenjiang, the puppet Executive Yuan secretary, were also debated and concluded regarding being traitors. The sentences will be pronounced at 2:00 PM on May 29th.

### Bizarre Assassination in the Ningbo Road Gauze Association: Deputy Captain of the Defense Corps and Accountant of the Association Found Dead in the Same Room

[Report from Our Newspaper] The fifth company of the third brigade of the Shanghai Municipal Defense Corps in the central district of Shanghai was located at Room 44 of the Ningbo Road Gauze Association. Tian Weiren, a Zhejiang native who was over forty years old, lived across the street at No. 46. Tian served as the accountant of the Gauze Association, and had two sons. The eldest son, Jianzhong, was an engineer in the Bureau of Public Works and lived elsewhere. The younger son, Jianmao, was still studying and lived with his father. At 8:00 PM the night before last, Jianzhong and his father attended a banquet somewhere and were driven back to their residence by car. Jianzhong then returned home. When Jianmao woke up yesterday morning, he could not find his father and was very surprised. He called his brother to inquire. Jianzhong replied that he had personally escorted his father home the night before and immediately rushed back to his father's residence to investigate. Sure enough, he could not find his father. He then knocked on the door of the Defense Corps office at No. 44 across the street to inquire about his father's whereabouts. However, the door was tightly closed and there was no response after knocking for a long time. He broke down the door and entered.

Suddenly, two corpses

were shockingly presented before his eyes. One was identified as Xu Zhan (25 years old, from Hebei), the deputy captain of the fifth company of the Defense Corps, who had a gunshot wound to the back of his head. The other deceased was Tian Weiren, who had been shot in the right eye. Both fell to the floor, and blood splattered everywhere, a truly tragic sight. Upon receiving the report, the Huangpu Police Bureau, led by Criminal Division Chief Zhou Guanghui and officers Wang Kecheng and Fu Lianfeng, along with Major Staff Officer Chen Mingjian of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, Li Shiqian of the Second Detective Team, and Wu Mingyong of the Defense Corps, conducted a detailed investigation. They saw a package of legal tender, totaling more than 100,000 yuan, and a watch, still placed on the desk,

Completely intact.

There were also 27 Japanese-made rifles, more than 20 rounds of ammunition, and several pieces of clothing. However, three wooden holster bags and four pistol holsters were left behind. According to Staff Officer Chen, the deceased Xu Zhan had served in the Sanmin Zhuyi Youth League Action Corps during the war, and later joined the puppet army. After the reorganization and downsizing, he served as the camp adjutant of the third battalion of the Garrison Regiment and was assigned to the company as deputy captain, responsible for training work, for almost four months. His death may have been caused by a grudge. As for Tian's tragic death, it was clear that he was attacked by thugs after hearing the sound and investigating, in order to silence him. According to general speculation, this shocking murder case seems to have

Political implications.

After achieving their goals, the murderers remained extremely calm, and except for breaking the light bulbs, they did not touch any of the valuables and collected all the bullet casings, so there were no traces to be found. The District Prosecutor's Office sent personnel to examine the scene yesterday afternoon and ordered the corpses to be claimed by their families. The police authorities have ordered a strict search for the murderer and are determined to bring him to justice.

### Shanghai's Three Women's Organizations Welcome Mayor Wu's Wife: "First, Strong Mothers; Then, Strong Children." Mayor Wu Encourages Women to Focus on Hygiene.

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Women's New Life Movement Promotion Association, the Medical and Pharmaceutical Women's Association, and the Women's Department of the Jingwu Athletic Association jointly welcomed Mayor Wu's wife at the Servi Naxi Restaurant on Albert Road yesterday at 3:00 PM. Approximately 70 representatives from each association attended.

The meeting began with a speech by the chairperson, Ms. Qian Jianqiu, who stated: "Mrs. Wu is well-versed in both Eastern and Western knowledge and assists the Mayor in all aspects of his work. Her virtue and achievements are admired by the citizens of Shanghai. In this great era, women bear a great responsibility and cannot be neglected in the future path of national construction. The women of Shanghai have long been eager to contribute to the country, and we are fortunate to have Mrs. Wu come to Shanghai to lead us. We believe that Mrs. Wu will surely provide us with much help and guidance in the future. Although the environment in Shanghai is complex and promoting work is more difficult, Mrs. Wu has extensive experience in leading women's work in Hankou and Chongqing. If she applies her past experiences in Shanghai, it will surely yield great results. I would like to express my gratitude on behalf of the women of Shanghai and extend a warm welcome."

Zhang Xiangwen Ms. Zhang Xiangwen, the director of Renhe Hospital, then reported: "Many schools in Shanghai were destroyed during the occupation, and the number of out-of-school youth has increased dramatically. Although the Women's Movement Association's activities have been suspended, we are still striving to maintain compulsory schools and offer medical and poverty assistance grants. Later, we organized an infant care department to take in abandoned or impoverished infants. However, all of this is limited by finances and cannot be expanded. Now that we have Mrs. Wu to lead us, various tasks can be smoothly advanced."

Liu Jianqiu Ms. Liu Jianqiu, the president of the Medical and Pharmaceutical Women's Association, said: "For decades, Chinese women have been in a passive position, but now they are gradually reforming. Women have the right to vote and be elected. We hope that we will no longer be in a passive position and should assume 50% of the country's responsibility. Under the leadership of Mrs. Wu, we should work even harder to serve. Homemakers have the greatest responsibility for creating healthy minds and strengthening the nation because prevention is always better than cure."

Mrs. Wu Mrs. Wu, the Mayor's wife, immediately gave a reply, expressing her great joy at meeting both old and new friends. She also expressed three points: "(1) Women should pay special attention to medical knowledge, family hygiene, and their own physical health. The past practice of foot-binding was a completely unreasonable system. How can there be a healthy nation without a healthy body? Only strong mothers can have strong children. (3) I am very happy to see so many female doctors and pharmacists today. In addition to their professions, women also have to take care of household affairs. This is something I am very proud of. Women have a dual responsibility, not only to serve in society but also to take on the responsibility of the family. Women must pay attention to hygiene at all times. Summer has arrived. In foreign countries, cholera has become a thing of the past, but it is still prevalent in China. Everyone should take precautions early."

Socializing and Entertainment Should Not Be Considered

(3) Thinking of the Women's Movement Association, there are many women in society who, once married, do not care about anything and indulge in socializing, entertainment, and playing cards all day long, putting national affairs behind them. This should also be reformed. It is most appropriate to start promoting social work from homemakers. I hope that the women of the city can work hard to implement the New Life Movement so that nation-building will surely succeed."

Xu Rui, a member of the Women's Movement Committee, had previously worked with Mrs. Wu in Hankou and Chongqing. She stood up to introduce Mrs. Wu's spirit of service, calling her an "unsung hero" because Mrs. Wu always buried herself in hard work and never engaged in verbal publicity after completing tasks. In Hankou, when enemy planes were bombing Hankou wildly, Mrs. Wu was in charge of childcare, rescuing refugee children brought in from the front lines. She personally met them at the station, placed them in prepared houses, and personally took care of their food, clothing, and shelter, even sewing children's clothes by hand. When the air raid alarm was not lifted, she often went to various places with Mayor Wu to offer condolences. This kind of spirit is what our country needs most."

Subsequently, Dr. Su Zufei, Lu Lihua, Yao Jilang, Zhu Su'e, and others gave speeches, mostly encouraging words, and expressed their willingness to work hard under the guidance of Mrs. Wu.

### Mayor Wu Attends the Housing Allocation Committee for the First Time: Illegal Occupants Must Be Evicted; Eleven Lane Neighborhoods in Hongkou to Be Processed First; Yeguang Company Still Has Not Registered.

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Executive Yuan's Shanghai Agencies Housing Allocation Committee held a routine meeting yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, attended by Director Wu Guozhen and Deputy Director He Deqiu to perform their inauguration ceremony. At the meeting, Director Wu gave a speech, encouraging all colleagues to continue to work hard, increase work efficiency, and cooperate to handle matters reasonably. Because Mr. Wu has been busy with official duties recently, he did not extend the meeting time, so there was no other discussion. At the same time, to facilitate future meetings, starting next week, the routine meeting every Wednesday will be changed to the City Hall Auditorium.

It is reported that the committee will process eleven lane neighborhoods in the Hongkou district inhabited by Japanese residents and other residents in the coming days.

### A Batch of Chinese Laborers Returns to Shanghai Today; Currently, 300,000 Japanese Prisoners of War and Residents Await Repatriation

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday, Mr. Ling of the port command, told our newspaper's reporter that the repatriation of Japanese prisoners of war has been slightly affected due to the outbreak of cholera. However, he firmly believes that it can be completed by the end of June. Currently, there are approximately 300,000 Japanese prisoners of war and residents awaiting repatriation, including 160,000 in Hankou (10,000 of whom are Japanese residents), 60,000 en route, and 80,000 concentrated in Shanghai. In the future, Japanese residents arriving in Shanghai will be concentrated in Fuxing so that the Japanese puppet houses in the designated Hongkou district can be used by the Housing Allocation Committee. Starting at the end of this month, the number of repatriations per day can be increased to more than 10,000. As for the National Restoration Army, a batch of 2,600 returned to China yesterday, and only a little over 1,000 remain in Shanghai.

It is also reported that a batch of 1,400 Chinese laborers illegally recruited by Japan during the war may arrive in Shanghai this afternoon on the Liberty Ship. The municipal authorities have sent personnel to greet them at that time.

### Lovers' Suicide in Mingde Lane: Gunshots Heard

[Our Newspaper's Report] Last night at 10:30 PM, a shooting occurred in Mingde Lane on Luoyang Road. Wu Jiechi, around thirty years old, usually dressed in a suit and wore glasses, had fallen deeply in love with Yuan Lixiu, a woman from Wujiang (26 years old), last autumn. Unexpectedly, Yuan had a fiancé, Shen Yuqing (30 years old), who returned to Shanghai from Chongqing a month ago and planned to hold a wedding. Wu, out of hatred, harbored malicious thoughts. He learned that Shen had a relative living at No. 101 Mingde Lane, where Yuan often visited. Wu ambushed himself beside the lane. When he saw Yuan coming out of that house, he drew his gun and shot her, hitting her right eye, penetrating her left neck, and she fell to the ground. At the same time, Wu fired a shot into his own right brain, fatally wounding himself. Afterward, Section Chief Xue Minjie and police officers Gao Xiancai and Feng Bojun from the Lujiawan Precinct went to investigate. Yuan was rushed to the hospital, where her life was said to be in danger. A six-inch handgun was found at the scene, with five bullets inside. Five pawn tickets, a pair of socks, and two letters were found on the deceased's person. One letter was addressed to his rival in love, Shen Yuqing, stating that Lixiu had pledged herself to him as early as last August and was two months pregnant. The other letter was addressed to his elder brother and sister-in-law, saying that he suffered from a chronic blood disease and would not live long.

### Female Employee of the Health Bureau Poisons Herself Before Her Wedding

[Our Newspaper's Report] Chen Bingyu, also known as Zhenrong, (23 years old, from Songjiang), a female employee of the Second Health Station of the Municipal Health Bureau, lived at No. 13 Caiyang Lane, Dongjiadu, Nanshi. At the age of thirteen, she was betrothed to Lei Jiajun, from the same town, by her parents. The wedding was to be held soon, and the two were deeply in love. Her fiancé currently works at the Engineering Department of the Nanjing Highway Administration and they often corresponded. Last month, her fiancé came to Shanghai to visit and stayed at Chen's house for more than ten days. Unexpectedly, Chen Bingyu suddenly poisoned herself at home at 5:30 PM the day before yesterday and died. According to the investigation results of the police station in charge, the reason for the suicide was that, apart from the fact that the wedding was to be held soon and both she and her fiancé were financially distressed, which led to melancholy and constant pessimism, her mother also had misunderstandings about her daughter. Chen was angered by this dual stimulus and committed suicide.

### Jiang Yiping Expresses His Views on Labor Unrest, Prices, and Other Issues

Mr. Jiang Yiping, a jurist, recently returned to Shanghai from the rear. Our reporter visited him at his residence and asked for his opinion on general issues in the city. Here is a brief record of Mr. Jiang's remarks: (1) Rising prices are all about supply and demand. If the municipal government can unleash the power of the people, allowing free collection and transportation in various industries, and assist them whenever difficulties are encountered, then goods will flood in and prices will naturally fall. (2) Regarding the issue of labor unrest, both labor and management must work together to increase production in order to seek stability in life. Therefore, factories must understand the hardships of workers, and workers should also understand the difficulties of the factories' overall planning. If they oppose each other, the closure of factories will inevitably lead to unemployment problems, which is detrimental to both labor and management. It is best if the factory authorities can inform the workers of the true situation within the factory in advance and put themselves in the workers' shoes to evoke the workers' sincere sympathy, then labor unrest will definitely not occur. I independently supported two alcohol factories in Sichuan. In the most depressed times, I was still able to cooperate thoroughly with the workers because the workers regarded the factory as their home and the factory owner as the head of the family, so there was no question of labor unrest. (3) Regarding the design of the police control zone, on the police bureau's side, I believe that they have no malicious intent to infringe on the people's freedom. However, the police's duty is to serve the people, and now that the people generally feel uneasy about this system, the police bureau should follow public opinion. If we do not investigate the police bureau's motives and give the police bureau a sharp critique, it will hinder the promotion of the spirit of cooperation between the citizens and the municipal authorities."

### The Famine in Hengyang is Unprecedented; A Fasting Movement for Merchants is Launched; The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Calls on All Industries to Respond

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce received an urgent telegram from the Hengyang Chamber of Commerce in Hunan Province stating that the famine in Hengyang this time is unprecedented. More than 10 million compatriots have no way to find food, and starvation is rampant, causing a scene of utter horror. The severity and extent of the disaster are shocking to hear. The Hengyang Chamber of Commerce witnessed the scene with heartache, as if sitting on pins and needles. At this critical juncture of the lean season, a fasting movement for merchants has been launched, urging the Shanghai business community to respond quickly in order to save the dying people in the disaster area. After receiving the telegram, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce submitted it to the Standing Committee, which unanimously resolved to respond and urged all industries in the city to implement a fasting movement for merchants. Donations of cash, no matter how much or how little, can be handed over to the chamber for transfer.

### Thoroughly Investigate the Seizure of Civilian Property by the Enemy and Puppets as Soon as Possible

Inspector Cheng Zhongxing, in view of the fact that although the government has repeatedly stipulated and supplemented methods for the takeover and use of enemy and puppet property, there are still many differences in handling, resulting in the failure to return the part of the property originally owned by civilians that was seized or forcibly used by the enemy and puppets during the occupation, causing the people to feel the most disappointed and painful. He specially telegraphed the Supervisory Yuan, requesting the central competent authorities to strictly order their subordinates to pay attention to rectification and thoroughly investigate as soon as possible.

### Students in the Capital Provisional University Preparatory Class Demand Unconditional Admission; Petition to the Ministry of Education Rejected; Students Stay Overnight at the Ministry Before Dispersing; Professors Advise That Exams Are Still Required

[Our Newspaper's Special Report from Nanjing] The Capital Provisional University Preparatory Class, which borrows the Jinling University campus for classes, originally agreed to return the campus by the end of April. After Deputy Minister Hang's mediation (Hang is the brother-in-law of Jinling University President Chen Yuguang), the loan was extended to the end of May. Therefore, the class was able to extend its term to the end of May and is scheduled to start exams on the 20th. A portion of the students in the class advocated extending the term by another month and put forward five points: (1) Extend the term to the end of June, (2) The credits earned should be recognized by all the schools to which they are assigned (In the past, some universities, when diagnosing poor grades in new students' previous studies, could order them to retake the credits, but those who passed the exam could be exempted from this problem), (3) Retain the right to assignment for one year (that is, those who are assigned but do not go to the school temporarily can still enter the school within one year), (4) Announce the names of the assigned schools and the number of students from this class that each school will allocate and accept, (5) Those who fail the exam should be assigned unconditionally, not according to the standards set by the Ministry. The most important thing is unconditional assignment. They organized a disciplinary team to prevent students who did not agree from taking the exam and blockaded their dormitories.

Petition to the Ministry of Education

At 9:00 AM on the 20th, more than 400 people gathered to petition the Ministry of Education. Wang Shulin, the director of the class, went to the Ministry of Education with them, but his attempts to stop them were ineffective. Several student representatives requested to meet with Zhou Hongjing, Director of the Higher Education Department. Zhou explained that the staff and students of Jinling University needed the campus to return to Beijing, so it had to be ended in time. The Ministry of Education had promulgated assignment methods, and schools would never admit students regardless of their grades. He explained and reasoned on each of the requests, urging them to uphold righteousness and take the exams in accordance with the law. The students were dissatisfied and gathered in the Ministry of Education's auditorium and the open space in front of the Lotus Pond, declaring that they would not achieve their goals unless their demands were met. They shouted slogans, demanding that Minister Zhu speak, Deputy Minister Zhu speak, and Deputy Minister Hang speak. Because it was raining, the staff of the Ministry of Education went to the scene, seeking righteousness, and advised the students to leave the rain and not seek trouble. The students moved to the auditorium for a while. Student representatives and Director Wang Shulin repeatedly requested the Ministry of Education.

Deputy Minister Hang Speaks

By the time the lights were on in the evening, Deputy Minister Hang spoke to the students, mentioning several points: (1) After repeated requests, Jinling University's campus was only available until the end of May, and Jinling University and Central University will have 6,000 people coming to Beijing. It is inevitable that the preparatory class will end by the end of May. (2) The universities have not yet submitted the forms, so it is impossible to pre-allocate the number of students assigned to each school. (3) The assignment methods for entering school, the assignment of returning students who joined the army as educated youth, and the assignment of outstanding students in the preparatory class all have standards to follow. This is not unique to students in the preparatory class. The methods set by the administration should be followed and cannot be changed. (4) The Ministry of Education should find ways to help students who are trying to make progress but whose families are in bandit areas. (5) I have always paid attention to student welfare, such as initiating the World Student Service Society. I hope that the students will not be swayed by temporary feelings and will follow the law. If anything happens, they can make suggestions in writing and not abandon the crowd to petition. After Deputy Minister Hang finished speaking, it was past 7:00 PM. The students felt that their goals had not been achieved and remained in the ministry, while a small number left without saying goodbye. Most stayed overnight in the ministry's reception rooms and dispersed at 6:00 AM on the 21st.

Professor's Association Advises

The Executive Council of the Professor's Association of the class convened an emergency meeting, stating that it was unreasonable to ask for something without examination (no matter what school, even elementary school students must pass an exam to enter). They urged the students to take the exam before talking about assignment. The students had no objection. On the 21st, Director Wang Shulin issued a notice: "With the approval of the suggestion of the Executive Council of the Professor's Association, the end-of-term exam of this class will be postponed by three days, starting from May 24 (Friday), and will be held according to the original procedure, so that students can review their studies." A joint meeting of all professors was held at 4:00 PM to prepare for the exam. This matter can be said to have come to an end. (Fool)

### Peking Provisional University of Engineering Students Oppose Joint Management and Demand the Restoration of an Independent Engineering College

[Our Newspaper, Peking] The Fifth Branch of the Peking Provisional University was originally the College of Engineering. All the students of this branch, in order to oppose the joint management by Peking University and Tsinghua University, and to demand the establishment of an independent engineering college, marched in formation at 9:00 a.m. on the 16th of this month with over nine hundred students. They first went to the General Branch of the Provisional University to visit Director Chen Xueping. The student representatives demanded that Director Chen immediately telegraph the Ministry of Education to approve the independence of the College of Engineering and requested a response from the Ministry within three days. Director Chen expressed that he did not have this authority but showed great sympathy for the students' demands and was willing to do his best to advocate for them. Finally, he said that the term "joint management" seemed to imply "merger," and he was willing to represent Peking University in assuring that there was no intention of merger, only to act according to government orders. The group then went to the Military Headquarters, but Director Li was not present, so Secretary-General Xiao Yishan received them, explaining that the Military Headquarters deeply sympathized with the independence of the College of Engineering and showed them a draft of their opinion report to the Chairman. The students expressed general satisfaction and then left to petition the Executive Yuan's office in Peking and the Office of the Censor, both of whom received them and promised to forward the telegram to the Ministry of Education. It was not until 2:00 p.m. that the entire student body returned to the school in formation. Shortly thereafter, the students of the college, in order to oppose joint management and demand the restoration of independence, issued the following declaration:

To Our Fellow Countrymen:

Dear fellow countrymen, our branch has nearly nine hundred students. By numbers, it is the largest engineering college in the country, and its level of education is not shallow. Moreover, the campus is the old site of the former Peking College of Engineering, which certainly has the conditions for an independent engineering college. However, at the beginning of this nation-building, the government intends to have our branch temporarily jointly managed by Tsinghua and Peking Universities, which is alarming. Since Peking University has no experience in running an engineering college and Tsinghua's engineering college can only accommodate four hundred students, they are unable to care for our nine hundred students, so joint management is clearly only a temporary measure. The predecessor of our branch was the Peiping University College of Engineering, founded during the Guangxu reign of the late Qing dynasty. It has a long history and obvious achievements. Since the War of Resistance, although it has suffered all sorts of oppression from the enemy, there have been no major changes in equipment, teachers, and curriculum. For several years, the entire faculty and student body have maintained the school spirit of the old Peiping University College of Engineering without any change. Today, after the victory of the War of Resistance, this school should be restored to continue to cultivate useful talents. Now, being temporarily jointly managed by Tsinghua and Peking Universities cannot continue for long. In other words, it cannot permanently cultivate talents for the benefit of the country and society. The state uses the same campus and equivalent funding, but it does not restore a permanent engineering college; instead, it creates a jointly-managed temporary university, which makes no sense. If our country's industrial education is not rapidly developed, how can underground treasures be mined? How can our beautiful mountains and rivers be utilized? If industry is not prosperous, the foundation of the nation will not be firm. How can we keep pace with the allied nations? The students of our branch, recognizing this, have convened a general meeting and unanimously passed the following resolutions: (A) Resolutely oppose unreasonable measures. (1) We should enjoy the same treatment as other engineering colleges (such as Tsinghua, Jiaotong, Beiyang, and other engineering colleges, all of which will be restored). (2) Of the eight branches of Peking Provisional University, seven already have proper destinations. It is inappropriate for the College of Engineering to be temporarily jointly managed. (3) Joint management of universities is an unprecedented measure in Chinese and foreign history. (B) China needs a large number of industrial talents to build the country. Only an independent engineering college that develops according to needs can meet this requirement, and our branch is qualified to become an independent college. (1) It has a long history, from the late Qing Dynasty to the present. (2) Its graduates are all over the country and have made outstanding contributions to the War of Resistance. (3) Our branch has nine hundred students, the largest of any engineering college in the country, and no university can accommodate it. (4) The existing equipment can be the foundation for developing China's industrial education. The nine hundred students of our branch, with twelve points of enthusiasm, call on our fellow countrymen across the country, hoping to receive strong response and support, to urge the government to accept our reasonable demands as soon as possible. The Student Self-Government Association of the Fifth Branch (College of Engineering) of Peking Provisional University.

### Peking China University to Reopen; Americans Eager to Study in China; Some American Students Have Already Arrived in Peking

[United Press, Peking, 22nd] "China University" here may reopen on October 1st of this year. This famous university, run by Americans, was closed by the Japanese after the Pearl Harbor incident. The enrollment list now has more than one hundred entering students. Dr. Feng Henry has been here for three weeks and is currently studying various issues related to the rapid reopening of the school. He hopes to complete his investigation by June 1st. Dr. Feng has been teaching at Xiangya Medical College in China for the past three years. He said that there are many Americans who are eager to study in China, and some have already arrived in Peking because they believe that the school has reopened. China University is funded by fifteen different American church units, as well as the China Education Fund's University of California. The number of church units supporting the school has tripled compared to before the war. Plans are now being drawn up to fund American students studying Chinese, so that they can stay in China for further studies.

### Respect Teachers Movement Committee Plans to Solicit Donations from Industrial and Commercial Circles; Yesterday's Tea Party for Middle School Principals

[Our City News] The Respect Teachers Movement Committee of this city held a tea party at the auditorium of Yucai Middle School yesterday at 4:00 p.m., gathering principals of middle schools from the entire city. More than one hundred units, including school principals, attended. First, Deputy Director Li reported the purpose of the meeting and requested the principals of each school to assist in guiding the student fundraising committee to launch a full-scale fundraising campaign to all factories, merchants, and firms in the city. Subsequently, Deputy Secretaries-General Chen Heqin and Pan Chuantong reported that the original plan was to solicit donations from the guilds, but this was still far from the target. Therefore, students from each school were requested to launch a fundraising campaign to the industrial and commercial circles on Saturday and Sunday. The results should be excellent, but because time is tight, there may not be enough time for preparation, and most major stores are closed on Sundays. Due to these two reasons, it is hoped that the campaign can be extended to Monday and Tuesday (the 27th and 28th), and students who participate will not be marked as absent or truant. The discussion then turned to the distribution method. Principals of various private schools in the city successively expressed their opinions, believing that the city schools have already received 80,000 yuan, while the private schools have not received this amount, so the distribution situation is very complicated. Finally, it was decided that representatives from the city's private school principals, the Respect Teachers Movement Committee, industrial and commercial circles, and students should be sent to discuss the matter together, so that the distribution problem could be resolved satisfactorily. The discussion was very lively, and the meeting adjourned at 6:30 p.m.

### Second Act of the Final Four Basketball Tournament: Lianghua vs. Shantou Tonight; Prelude Interlude: Journalist Team and Tongfa Team Meet

The Final Four Basketball Championship kicked off the other day. Lianghua made a winning start, defeating the invincible Xinhao team, while the Shantou team unfortunately lost to Xiqing by one point. The second act will begin this afternoon at the City Gymnasium. Tickets are still sold for 2,000 downstairs, 1,000 upstairs, and 10,000 for honorary seats in the arena. Previously issued long-term gift certificates will no longer be used. Military and police must purchase tickets to enter the arena. In addition to the original two programs, a prelude will be added at 6:00 p.m., with a match between the Tongfa team, organized by journalists and famous actors. At that time, in addition to the band from the refugee and orphaned children's shelter still playing music, the Boy Scouts of Gezhi Middle School will maintain the order. The three games are as follows:

Tongfa - Journalists (Friendly Match) 6:00 p.m.

Xinhao - Xiqing (Championship Game) 7:00 p.m.

Lianghua - Shantou (Championship Game) 8:00 p.m.

Famous Actors Take the Stage

The battle between Tongfa and the Journalists will take the stage first. Tongfa is organized by famous actors, such as Lao Sheng (old male roles) Li Zongyi, Wu Sheng (martial male roles) Li Shengbin, and Xiao Sheng (young male roles) Gao Weilian. Not only are they famous on the stage, but they also have great interest in basketball. Li Zongyi and the Lianghua generals are very familiar with each other and used to be on the same team, so his basketball skills are superb. The team recently defeated the Pang team, which shows its abundant fighting power. The journalist team has had good results since its formation, repeatedly defeating strong enemies and shaking the sports world. Players such as Wang Weijun, Zhou Jun, Qian Xucang, Xu Guiqiang, Cao Xizhen, and Jin Jiabiao have also fought in the arena for a long time and have a strong lineup, which should be able to compete with the famous actors.

Championship Competition

The championship game will start at 7:00 p.m., with Xinhao and Xiqing competing. The two teams have different skills. Xinhao's offense is fast and the shooting is prepared, but the defense is more lax. Captain Seymour, short and agile, is the most formidable. After being humiliated by Lianghua the other day, they should try to cheer up and seek revenge. Xiqing is a combined force of Giants and Encas. Giants lost to Xinhao by one point in the Mayor's Cup final, so this is a good opportunity for revenge. I hope the athletes will rise up and fight hard to wash away their previous shame.

Lianghua Enters the Battle

The last game, Lianghua vs. Shantou, will start at 8:00 p.m. In the battle the other night, Lianghua defeated Xinhao, raising their eyebrows and restoring their former fame. Li Zhenzhong's command was decisive, and he is the soul of the three armies. Shen Yu won the point. Liu Fushan and Zhang Shaoqing are good materials from the Southern faction, and their performances are excellent and complement each other. Tonight, they will make their second appearance, and there will be an even more wonderful performance. This time, the Shantou team's generals have returned to reorganize their forces. Relying on their fast blocking tactics, they showed it without reservation in the previous battle against Xiqing, which is a pity. Although the competition will be tough, they will fight hard. The tension of the performance can be predicted.

In addition, the Basketball Committee hopes that enthusiastic people will enthusiastically donate money to increase funding income. The other day, Mr. Cheng Bo'an generously donated one million yuan. In the future, a bronze plaque will be cast in the gymnasium, listing the names of the donors as a permanent memorial. The six teams playing tonight are listed below:

(Journalists) Qu Yaokang (Leader), Zhang Guochun (Captain), Wang Weijun, Qian Xucang, Zhou Jun, Cao Xizhen, Qiu Guoxiang, Jin Jiabiao, Xu Guiqiang, Chen Yinshan, Zhang Zhengwei, Di Xian, Ma Youyu, Li Houcheng.

(Tongfa) Li Zongyi, Li Shengbin, Zhang Shitong, Li Zongcheng, Li Zongqi, Zhang Chuntie, Zhang Xupu, Wu Xianyun, Zhao Zongzheng, Gu Geng, Gao Weilian, Zhou Ji.

(Xinhao) Peigan, Telam, Mann, Angeli, Max, Seymour, Slavaf, Jackson.

(Xiqing) Taoblinji, Funik, N Sasijin, T Sasijin, Steven, Carson, Katie Milov, Chochinson, Qiang Dulai, Botuo.

(Lianghua) Qian Xulun (Coach), Xu Song (Manager), Tang Bao (Captain), Li Zhenzhong, Shen Yugong, Wu Bishun, Zhang Shaoqing, Tao Lin, Wang Xuewu.

(Shantou) Lin Zuozhan (Leader), Ma Xi (Captain), Chen Qingjiang, Lin Cong, He Lide, Ji Nanlian, Zhou Bin, Chen Mingyi, Lin Ziliang, Xu Yougai, Tang Wenjun.

### Professor Jiang Xiangqing Discusses: Shanghai as China's Sports Capital; The Dynamics and Development of Sports Must Emphasize Psychological Construction; Learning from the West Requires Mastering Practical Application, Not Merely Enjoying its Benefits

Professor Jiang Xiangqing, the founder of sports in this city, has returned to Shanghai on leave from [Chengdu] after a nine-year absence. Director Gu, upon learning of this, immediately offered him the position of director of the Municipal Sports Field, urging him to stay and serve in Shanghai. He is currently taking the exam [for this position]. After presiding over Wuhan University for five years during the war, he went to the National Guizhou Normal College to establish a sports department, cultivating teachers for the rear area and developing sports in the Southwest, making significant contributions. He is the author of "Sports and Life," a book of two hundred thousand words, which, in addition to receiving a special publication grant from the Academic Review Committee of the Ministry of Education, was also officially approved by the Ministry as proof of his professorial qualification. This makes him the first person in the Chinese sports world without foreign study experience to obtain a professor's certificate. In recent years, he has continued his research, supplementing and revising his work, hoping to publish it after the political situation stabilizes. The Board of Directors of the China Education and Culture Foundation has granted him a special research grant to fulfill his ambition. His appointment as a member of the qualification review committee for the promotion of teachers in independent colleges, achieving a lofty academic status, is also due to this. It is truly an encouragement to his peers that a sports professor has received this honor. According to him, Shanghai is not only China's economic capital but also its sports capital. In industrial cities, the value of recreational education naturally surpasses all else, but in addition to entertainment, one must not forget its greater significance—reforming the next generation to bear the heavy burden of modern citizenship. Therefore, its development must not be detached from or run counter to education. Since the whole country looks to Shanghai as a leader, it must set a good example for others to emulate, so as not to be criticized by discerning people. A nation of third-rate physiques cannot build a first-rate country. The title of one of the "Big Four" cannot be made to match reality through mere lip service. Therefore, cultivating people is even more important than creating wealth. How to cultivate people? There are only two ways: (1) One must recognize sports as a form of labor. What distinguishes it from general labor is merely that it is dressed in a happy garment and can only produce indirectly rather than directly. So-called indirect production means that after learning sports, one must improve one's work efficiency, produce invisibly, and reap tangible rewards. If one is a student, then one must be able to enhance one's academic performance and moral character. In short, there should be a bridge between the sports field and the workplace. If this bridge is cut off, then sports is a waste, and sports people are consumers rather than producers, which, in terms of social problems, is a crime. It is like having a sick person in a family, who not only reduces the number of producers but also requires some healthy people to provide medicine, sharing in the consumption of manpower and resources. Wasteful sports is not what China, which is currently in extreme economic poverty, needs. We learn from the West to innovate, but we must learn how to "apply" it, not merely how to "enjoy" it. At least until China embarks on the road to modernity, this proposition must be emphasized, because we do not yet have the qualifications to enjoy sports. (2) Mere physical health does not benefit the nation. Only when the mind is equally healthy can one contribute to both the individual and the greater good. Physical ill-health is a crime, but mental ill-health is an even greater crime. This is why Dr. Sun Yat-sen's emphasis on psychological construction is something that our sports community and sports enthusiasts must strive for. Therefore, the title of sports capital carries a heavy responsibility and a long journey, a high reputation and a distant abode, which is truly thought-provoking.

### Answering Readers' Legal Questions

(1) Cui Lin asks: During the war, my father was forced by the enemy and puppet forces to sell his house at a low price. I have recently returned from the rear, but I do not know what legal basis I should use [to reclaim it]. Please advise.

[Lawyer Duanmu Kai replies:] If you have concrete proof that you were forced by the enemy and puppet forces, you can submit it to the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau for review.

(2) Xia Ru asks: (1) Does Article 12 of the Supplementary Measures for Civil Litigation, regarding remedial measures, refer to "leases and loans that have undergone drastic changes in circumstances, and whose effectiveness under the original relationship is obviously unfair," or does it refer to "private debts and the redemption and return of all real estate sales, mortgages, and leases"? Or does it refer to both? Please explain in detail. (2) During the enemy and puppet era, what method should be used to redeem a mortgage contract established using puppet currency, now calculated in legal tender? (3) If a mortgage contract was established using puppet currency, and the other party still refuses to allow redemption even when legal tender is used to redeem it at the appropriate rate, what should be done? (4) Please explain the text of Article 12 of the Supplementary Measures.

[Lawyer Duanmu Kai replies:] (1) (4) According to the Interpretation of Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Litigation After Recovery, legal acts are not limited to leases and loans, but include all legal acts. (2) (3) Puppet Central Reserve Notes should be converted to legal tender at a rate of two hundred to one. If the other party disputes this, you can seek a court decision to resolve it.

(3) Chen Kechang asks: I previously rented a shop from Mr. B, who is a sub-landlord. It was agreed that the stove room would be shared by seven tenants. The stove room was originally built with lead sheeting, which has not been repaired for eight years and is in disrepair. I asked Mr. A and Mr. B to repair it, but Mr. B replied that he could not afford to repair it, and Mr. A said that he would demolish all the lead sheeting and floorboards, estimating that it would cost 500,000 yuan, which he proposed to be shared by all the tenants, but this was rejected. I ask: (1) If I repair it at my own expense, and Mr. A insists on demolishing it and preventing me from doing so, what should be done? (2) If the repair cost is very high, and I repair it at my own expense, but it is still for public use, can I ask for the stove room to be transferred to me for residence? Does Mr. A have the right to prevent this?

[Lawyer Duanmu Kai replies:] (1) If the stove room is necessary for use, you can only ask Mr. B to repair it. (2) If Mr. B has been using the stove room, then there is no problem since Mr. B has agreed.

### Enthusiastic Disaster Relief by Employees of China Textile Mill No. 17; Earnestly Requesting Donations from All Sectors

To the Editor: From the newspapers, the famine in Hunan and Guangxi is becoming increasingly serious. Eating clay, gnawing on tree bark, and cannibalism—all kinds of horrific scenes are being enacted day by day and spreading day by day. Faced with this situation, all of us compatriots, reading about it, should ask ourselves, can we remain unmoved? We are a group of workers in the textile mill, working day and night, heads down, toiling diligently. News of the famine in Hunan and Guangxi has reached everyone's ears, and the most fervent cries are coming from the depths of everyone's hearts! We need to provide relief for the famine in Hunan and Guangxi; we cannot be numb. Although the literate among us are a definite minority, compassion is something everyone possesses. We need to provide relief for the famine in Hunan and Guangxi—regarding others' drowning as our own, regarding others' hunger as our own. Moreover, since we are all descendants of the Yellow Emperor, how can we stand idly by and not care? Those with money should contribute money, those with strength should contribute strength. Disaster relief is like putting out a fire; we hope that all people of goodwill will rise up together to help, so that the disaster-stricken people of Hunan and Guangxi can be spared from death. It's not only the disaster-stricken people who will be saved, but the safety of society is also at stake.

### Wounded Soldier Pleading for Relief

To the Editor: I am a wounded sergeant from Huarong County, Hunan Province. In the 31st year of the Republic [1942], I went on an expedition to India and Burma and was wounded in the war. This February, I returned to the country with honor and reported to the Army Headquarters. I then returned to Huarong to recuperate, only to find that my old home had been destroyed by enemy aircraft, and my family members had all died. I have no relatives or friends, and I am destitute. I did not hesitate to travel to Shanghai, hoping that the military and political authorities in Shanghai would provide relief. I have described my plight in detail to the municipal government, the garrison headquarters, the social bureau, and other agencies, requesting relief and placement, but all of them said that they had no authority to handle it. I have no relatives or friends here, and I have been in Shanghai for many days, and I am about to become a vagrant. I have no choice but to implore your esteemed newspaper to show sympathy and publish my situation in the newspaper to appeal to all sectors of society. I also earnestly hope that the compatriots in Shanghai will act with love and sincerity to provide relief to prevent me from becoming a vagrant. I would be eternally grateful. Hereby wishing you good health. Respectfully, Tang Xiangqing

### Allocation Price Rises with Black Market; Gold Market Atmosphere Cheerful; Continues to Rise by 40,000 Compared to Previous Closing

Following yesterday's continued prosperity, the Central Bank allocated 221 bars to colleagues, and the price rose to 1.91 million. People's apprehensions have been swept away, and the market price has continued to rise steadily. The morning opened flat, and after opening, many floating positions were closed, causing a slight dip to 1.89 million.

Generally, people believe that the allocation price is always comparable to the black market. Based on past examples of forward foreign exchange and cloth allocations, the future of the Central Bank's control of gold prices is not underestimated. Everyone believes that the floor price may rise further. The psychology of retail investors is fluctuating. After the allocation was completed, the market gradually improved, rising to around 1.96 million at noon before stabilizing slightly. In the afternoon, same-day delivery still stood at around 1.95 million, up 40,000 from the previous close.

In the afternoon, the price suddenly rose to 1.4 million yuan. The miscellaneous brand Blackbird asked for 40,000 yuan more than yesterday, and the rest were similar to the previous day, but there were no transactions.

The lower grade identity was softer and the color was worse, returning 42,000 yuan, not opened. Miscellaneous red was 56,000 to 57,000 yuan.

Dried lily flowers are trending firmly due to shortage. Yesterday, the market price at the Te Gao Xiangzhuang vegetable shop was 160,000 to 170,000 yuan, ordinary 140,000 to 150,000 yuan, and the next best 120,000 to 130,000 yuan.

Recently, longan has been short of stock, especially Xinghua longan, which is even rarer, leading to repeated price increases. Several dozen loads of miscellaneous large goods were opened, rising another 10,000 yuan compared to the previous day, so the market price also followed step by step, climbing up the ladder.

### Fifteen Minutes of Market Activity; Few Yarn Transactions

Yesterday, the yarn industry market was virtually suspended because the 5th Company of the 2nd Brigade of the Central District Regiment of the Shanghai Municipal Defense General Corps was stationed on the fourth floor of Tonghe Guli Yarn and the association. The night before, it was suddenly visited by rioters who attempted to seize the team's firearms, and the association clerk Mr. Tian and the team's instructor, who were staying on the fourth floor, were killed, and several handguns were snatched away (details can be found in the local news section). As a result, the front and back doors of the association were closed yesterday morning, and colleagues had no way to gather. Although it was opened for fifteen minutes at 10:15 AM, the association announced at 11:00 AM that the market would close early, so there were very few transactions. In the alleyway trading, Da Sheng Factory sold more than 100 pieces of 20-count Cai Kuixing yarn, priced at 1.11 million. The supply of other 20-count spot goods was not much. Zhejiang, Fujian, and Beijing-Wuhu merchants slightly reduced their inventory, and prices rose by about 10,000 to 20,000 compared to the previous day, with a very firm foothold. At noon, Fangjian opened yarn as usual. Among them, 10-count double-strand and 20-count coarse yarn rose by 50,000 to 70,000 compared to the previous period, while 32-count and 42-count thread decreased by 20,000 to 100,000. It was also heard that another set of 12 kinds of fine yarn and thread were sold by bidding. The development of spring silkworms in Xiangchun is early. The early batch has already spun cocoons, the large batch is shedding leaves after the big sleep, and the late batch is in the third sleep stage. The early batch of spring silkworms in Houzhai, Shengli Fang, Qiaodong, and other places have all had their big sleep, and the silkworms are healthy. However, the price of mulberry leaves has soared. The price was previously 6,000 yuan per load, but now it has risen to 11,000 yuan due to the influence of rice prices.

### Situation Gradually Improving; Stock Market Sentiment More Stable

Chinese stocks began to compete between bulls and bears. Small stocks, due to the overall situation improving, attracted some speculative funds, and retail investors' panic gradually stabilized. The process was much better than that of large stocks. Yongsha opened at 5230 yuan, Meiya at 4200 yuan, and closed at lower prices. Jingfu's midpoint was at the highest 365 yuan, Xinguang at 300 yuan, and Qinxing at 265 yuan. At noon, it was influenced by the fatigue of large stocks and was also brought down. As a result, large stocks Yongsha and Meiya only rose slightly compared to the previous close, while small stocks continued to rise by half a percentage. The rest were slightly better. Foreign stocks had balanced supply and demand. A certain trust company cut more, and the securities firms filled the short positions. The process was in a stable state, with slight gains. As a result, except for Jardine Matheson, which was flat, large stocks rose very little, while small stocks rose by half a percentage.

### Bituminous Coal Rises; White Coal Falls; Fuel Management Committee Continues to Allocate

The sales of bituminous coal lumps are slightly more active, and sellers want to raise prices slightly, and the market price has risen slightly by 10,000 yuan. The arrival of white coal lumps in the north continues smoothly, but sales are still limited to lower-grade goods such as small coal, and the market price is hovering in a soft range. There are two main reasons for the current sluggish sales of white coal: (1) because the season for coal stoves has passed, and (2) most restaurants previously used mud coal as a substitute due to the interruption of the source of white coal lumps and the high price. Now, if they reuse white coal lumps, their bellows and stoves will have to be completely refitted to be suitable, and the refitting cost is huge, so the sales of white coal lumps to the restaurant industry are difficult to promote for a while.

[Another Report] In order to completely stabilize fuel, the Fuel Management Committee continues to purchase on a large scale from various places. On the one hand, it still allocates coal to the actual users of various industries according to their actual needs. According to the daily spot needs of each coal merchant in the city, the committee assigns the Minsheng Coal Management Office to be responsible, and the allocation price is 160,000 yuan per ton of No. 1 bituminous coal dust and 140,000 yuan per ton of No. 2 bituminous coal dust. As for trains, ships, and industrial factories, the management committee directly assigns them: (1) Trains: 70,000 yuan per ton, (2) Ships: 70,000 yuan per ton, (3) Industrial factories: 135,000 yuan per ton. It is heard that the merchants are afraid that it will be difficult to sell in the future due to the high allocation price.

### Active Spot Cotton Trading

The New York American cotton market reported a decline of six to eight pound coins, calculated as 27.38 for near-term US dollars, 27.91 for long-term, and 27.97 for Mitchell's spot goods. The local spot cotton trading is lively. The Fangjian Company smoothly handled Mitchell's price from 94,000 to 97,000, and Qielila's second-grade was 70,000 yuan, for a total of 2,670 bales. China New No. 7 Factory imported 103,000 yuan of super Mitchell.

### Indian Merchants Purchasing Extracted Tribute

In the foreign tea market, recently, only Indian merchants are still trading for high-quality special extracted tribute tea. Unfortunately, this variety was mostly converted by tea factories in the city into domestic tea during the war due to transportation issues. Although the new goods have been on the market for a long time, they have not been made yet, so there are still a few stocks of old goods in the market, and holders believe that they are rare goods to be sold. As a result, the trend tends to be good. Yesterday, about 100 loads were dragged in by Qianyi Foreign Company, and the price was 38,000 yuan per load, which was more than 1,000 yuan higher than the previous day. Other firms such as Ruichang Nianmazhi are still negotiating with the cargo side. Looking at the current situation, the 40,000 yuan mark is very easy to break through. As for the American New York market, although there are telegrams asking about prices, the offered prices are harsh, and there is no hope for transactions to develop. Domestic routes, Tianjin merchants are moving ineffectively, while this street and Suzhou-Wuxi and other places are very smooth, and the situation is firmly unchanged.

### Wuxi Silkworm Season is Still Good; Mulberry Leaf Price is 11,000 Yuan

[Wuxi News] The weather has been warm for several days, and the development of spring silkworms in the countryside is good. The early silkworms have already spun cocoons, the large batch is shedding leaves after the big sleep, and the late batch is in the third sleep stage. The early batch of spring silkworms in Houzhai, Shengli Fang, and Qiaodong have all had their big sleep, and the silkworms are healthy. However, the price of mulberry leaves has soared. The price was previously 6,000 yuan per load, but now it has risen to 11,000 yuan due to the influence of rice prices.

### Social Bureau Has Agreed Yesterday; Regulated Price Flour Sales Method; Preparation Ready to Go into Effect Soon; List of Sales Points Decided

In order to relieve the people's food shortage, the Social Bureau has agreed with the office of the Special Commissioner of the Grain Department to sell regulated-price flour on a regular basis. Fifty rice shops in the city have been designated to sell it widely. The bureau specially convened the persons in charge of each of these rice shops at 10:00 AM yesterday to discuss the implementation method. It was decided that each store should sell flour at a regulated price at a rate of 20 bags per day, until it is sold out. Every morning, the Grain Administration Special Commissioner's Office will send the flour to each rice shop by car for sale that day. The time is from 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM. Each household should purchase based on their household registration card, up to six catties per household, at 250 yuan per catty. The proceeds from the sales of each store should be submitted every five days to the Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank and its branches for collection and forwarding. If the amount of flour purchased by each buyer is short or if there is corruption, the bureau is allowed to report it for investigation. The fifty designated rice shops are mostly located in Guomin districts such as Nanshi, Zhabei, and Huxi. Each shop will be given a handling fee of 1,000 yuan per bag. The retail price will be reviewed and announced once a week, and each sales point must display a sign for public knowledge. The names of the rice shops have been found out as follows: Gongyi, Tongfeng, Wanxiang, Zhihe, Desheng Gong, Hongsheng, Tongfaxin, Yongfu, Hongshengtai, Hetai, Hengkang, Huang Changsheng, Yinchang, Baocheng, Mintai, Tongtai, Jiahejiang, Hefeng, Shanghai, Hongfutai, Wufu Company, Xinfeng, Hengchang, Shixing, Huasheng, Yuantai, Wanchangxin, Yonghengchang, Wanyuxin, Hengyigong, Fulong, Hongtaiyuan, Shenyuanchang, Xiefeng, Ling Wantai, Wanxing, Chenghongxing, Daxing, Wantai Xing, Yihe, Tongmao, Dong Sanyang, Longsheng, Tongsheng Taiji, Wanchangfu, Jintai, Yuanchang, Yong'an.

### Inactivity of Tung Oil Export

[Report from this newspaper] White tung oil has been fluctuating and stagnant, showing no signs of improvement. Recently, large quantities of Han tung oil have continued to arrive, leading to a weak and sluggish market. While the prices of other vegetable oils, especially cooking oils, have repeatedly increased, tung oil prices have remained unchanged. People are understandably dissatisfied. However, the problem lies in different sales channels, as tung oil relies entirely on export. Currently, export trade has not been adjusted, leaving exporters unable to develop, and the market with little change, creating a situation of long-term stagnation and short-term spurts. The local selling price has recently decreased slightly, with white tung oil at 66,000 yuan, West Fuhongjiang tung oil at 82,000 yuan per barrel, and local Hong oil at 63,000 to 4,000 yuan.

Before the war, the annual export volume of tung oil consistently reached over 70,000 tons. The price of tung seeds for producing tung oil before the war was twice that of grain. During the war, it was only one-third. In the provinces of Sichuan, Hunan, and Hubei, farmers increased grain production and cut down tung trees.

Although there are no accurate statistics on China's tung oil production in recent years, according to the export figures from Shanghai since the victory, the output is less than 2,000 tons. The export from Sichuan, Shaanxi, Guangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Zhejiang, and Anhui has been cut off for the past eight years, and the stock in each place is also very weak. Domestic transportation is not smooth, and shipping is difficult. However, without export activity, the market cannot improve even if freight is unimpeded. Furthermore, tung oil export is more difficult than other materials because of its low price and heavy weight. Therefore, exporters were active at the time of victory, but are now experiencing a return to inactivity. Most exporters are now shrinking their operations or switching to import trade, waiting for future developments.

The United States has a great need for tung oil, and the price in New York has increased three times compared to pre-war levels (currently 38 cents per pound). However, given the high value of general agricultural products in our country, this price is still far from the domestic price.

### Loan and Deposit Businesses

Must Not Be Operated Without Authorization

Shanghai Branches Are Considered Branches

[Report from this newspaper] According to Article 2 of the Banking Management Regulations issued by the Ministry of Finance, any commercial bank establishing a branch must first apply to the Ministry of Finance for approval. Before approval, it must not be established without authorization, nor should it cleverly create other names to conduct loan and deposit businesses. Although the regulations are strict, some branches in Shanghai are operating deposit and loan businesses under the guise of Shanghai Branches, which has come to the attention of the Ministry of Finance, which has wired orders to the relevant authorities in Shanghai to strictly prohibit this.

### Mayor Wu Earnestly Informs Rice Merchants to Sincerely Comply with Emergency Measures; Legitimate Transactions Will Be Protected by Law

[Report from this newspaper] After Mayor Wu Guozhen took office, he announced four emergency measures to stabilize grain prices in the city, which gradually led to a decline in rice and grain prices. Yesterday afternoon at 3 PM, Wu met with Wan Molin, the chairman of the Bean and Rice Industry Association, to hear reports. It was reported that rice prices in the city continued to fall by 5,000 to 6,000 yuan yesterday, and the bean and rice industry sincerely supports the government's measures. Mayor Wu told them that the government will fully protect legitimate merchants, and he hopes that legitimate merchants will also do their best to assist the government. The four emergency measures announced the day before must be thoroughly implemented to stabilize grain prices and ensure the people's livelihood. He asked Wan to inform all bean and rice industries in the city to comply with the measures. Wan said that he would inform all bean and rice industries in the city to comply.

### Social Affairs Bureau Explains the Purpose of Registering Rice Stocks

Registering rice stocks is one of the emergency measures adopted by the authorities to stabilize rice prices. The Social Affairs Bureau is gradually promoting this. A reporter from the Central News Agency, in order to understand the current situation and future handling of this matter, visited Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau and was granted an interview. The following are excerpts from the questions and answers at that time:

Question: How is the registration of rice stocks being handled by your bureau?

Answer: Very smoothly. Many people come to the bureau every day to inquire about the filing procedures.

Question: Should rice stock owners report to their respective industry associations, or can they apply directly to your bureau for registration?

Answer: The principle is to report to the respective industry associations first, and then have the association report to us. However, if they are not related to any association, they can register directly with our bureau.

Question: What will be done after registration?

Answer: First, we will conduct random inspections; second, we will make public announcements; and third, we will appropriately observe the market supply and demand situation and supervise sales at any time to maintain the people's food supply.

Question: If the public reports on national rice but cannot clearly understand the situation, can they be allowed to consult the registration book in your bureau?

Answer: Of course, they can be allowed.

Question: What will be done with the rice that arrives daily after the registration period expires?

Answer: Newly arrived rice is still allowed to be registered at any time, without any restrictions.

Question: If there is a sale or movement after registration, should permission be applied for in advance, or should a movement permit be issued?

Answer: There is no need to apply for permission in advance, and our bureau will not issue movement certificates. However, the transaction price, quantity, and the names of the buyer and seller should still be reported to the association and then to the bureau for verification. It should be understood that the purpose of this registration of rice stocks is to: (1) clearly understand the exact amount of stocks; (2) crack down on hoarding; and (3) prohibit non-industry individuals from operating in grain, in order to bring rice prices down naturally. That is all. There are no other effects. Our bureau will still protect legitimate transactions and the procurement of grain by rice merchants in accordance with the law, and there are no new restrictions or special procedures.

Question: Are there any fees for registration?

Answer: There are no fees.

Question: Has a period of implementation been predetermined for this measure?

Answer: No. Once rice prices return to normal and the market returns to normal, we can report to the municipal government and end it at any time.

### Sales in Stores Greatly Reduced; Rice Prices Continue to Fall

Yesterday, the rice market remained stagnant, with a sharp decline in sales by stores. People were weak and uncertain, and more rice continued to plummet by 5,000 to 6,000 yuan. Xian rice also fell by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Flour sales in stores decreased, and there was little trading, resulting in a decline of 700 to 800 yuan. There was no export route for soybeans, and the local market was weak. High-quality goods remained stable, but medium and low-quality goods fell by another 1,000 yuan. Soybean cakes followed suit and continued to weaken by 200 to 300 yuan. Bran sales were sluggish, and prices gradually declined, dropping by another 200 to 300 yuan. After a small price drop in the oil market, some activity resumed. However, the market was weak in the morning and stabilized at noon. Yesterday, according to the rice market information, a total of more than 6,000 piculs of rice arrived in the city, with the following types and picul numbers: White Geng 3,155 piculs, Bo Dao 730 piculs, Early Rice 82 piculs, Yang Xian 615 piculs, Du Xian 509 piculs, Wu Xian 420 piculs, Bai Yuan 55 piculs, Yin Yuan 85 piculs.

### A Sketch of Dr. John Lucian Savage, the Great Designer of the Yangtze River Dam

— Special Translation by the Editorial Department of This Newspaper

If you are looking for an engineer to build a dam on the Mississippi River, the Amazon River, or other large rivers, and to use hydroelectric power to supply homes and industries, you must find Dr. Savage. Only he can solve this problem.

He looks like a strict and kind grandfather, but in reality, he is a welcome companion to many young people everywhere. He does not smoke, drink, or swear, but he has hiked or ridden over the Rocky Mountains, the Himalayas, and other treacherous mountain ranges.

Sixty-Six Years Old, Still Diligently Serving

Dr. Savage has designed more dams than anyone else in history. Many countries are now eager for his guidance. At least sixty dams have been built according to his plans, with a value of over one billion US dollars. The power generated by the hydroelectric power plants he designed and built is likely beyond Edison's dreams.

Dr. Savage presided over the design of the Boulder Dam in Colorado during President Hoover's term. This was an unprecedentedly difficult dam project at the time. Later, Savage designed two even larger power generation and irrigation dams for President Roosevelt: the Grand Coulee Dam on the Columbia River—the largest man-made structure in the world today—and the Shasta Dam in California.

You may think that Dr. Savage has achieved so much and, at the age of sixty-six, should retire. Indeed, from 1903 until last year, except for an eight-year hiatus, he has diligently served the US Reclamation Bureau and has never stopped working. However, this giant of dam construction is now concentrating on an unprecedentedly great plan.

A Massive Project, Excavating Twenty Tunnels

This plan involves placing millions of pounds of cement in the Three Gorges of the Yangtze River, generating five times the power of the Grand Coulee Dam. The idea of using the Yangtze River's water power was first initiated by the founding father of China, Dr. Sun Yat-sen. President Chiang Kai-shek was greatly inspired by Dr. Savage's grand plan and decided to enlist the help of this American dam expert to assist China in developing all of its natural resources.

Dr. Savage's Yangtze River dam project is almost equivalent to channeling the Mississippi River into the Grand Canyon and then blocking it. Compared to it, the Boulder Dam in Colorado is like a small wizard seeing a great wizard.

At the site of this massive project, there are steep cliffs above and turbulent waves below. Dr. Savage estimates that the amount of water that needs to be discharged is five times that of the Boulder Dam, so he has to excavate twenty tunnels, each fifty feet in diameter, through the mountains, because the Boulder Dam has four similar tunnels.

The cost of the Yangtze River dam project is estimated at one billion US dollars. Once the dam is completed, ocean-going vessels will be able to sail upstream for more than a thousand miles, reaching the capital Chongqing.

The world's largest lock gate can only lift ships by fifty to sixty feet at most. Now Dr. Savage plans to build an unparalleled gate and tunnel system, allowing giant ships to enter the tunnel and then be lifted by huge cranes up to the top of the gate, 530 feet high.

The Yangtze River dam's power distribution area is inhabited by 140 million residents, equal to the entire population of the United States. Once Savage's plan is realized, this vast and backward region of the East will initially benefit from industrialization. Modern irrigation systems will give new life to millions of acres of old-fashioned fields, and the Yangtze River's floods will be eliminated from now on.

Savage's Plan Benefits Both China and the United States

This matter clearly has a significant impact on the global political and diplomatic landscape. Some people think that even if backward China has huge industrial potential, it does not know how to use it. Others feel that a strong China will pose a threat to American manufacturers, and therefore do not approve of the US government or bankers funding China's Yangtze River plan. Before this plan can receive the help of the American financial community, officials in Washington must carefully study whether this plan to develop the Far East is beneficial to the United States.

Those who support this plan say that it is beneficial to the United States. They say that building a strong China and bringing the 450 million people who are friends of the United States out of misery is beneficial to the United States, because the United States needs China's cooperation to maintain peace in the Far East. Furthermore, if China remains poor and starving forever, the American business community will not be able to obtain trade benefits. After China industrializes, the United States can have 450 million good customers.

The late President Roosevelt specially dispatched Nelson, the former director of the War Production Board, to visit China to assist China in solving wartime production problems. Nelson met Dr. Savage in Chongqing and, after hearing his plan, was greatly excited and immediately wired Washington, strongly recommending Savage's plan. When Savage's engineering drawings arrived in Washington, some officials in the State Department did not seem very interested. However, after Nelson's constant advocacy, the US Reclamation Bureau and the Chinese government finally signed a $500,000 contract last fall. The engineers of the US Reclamation Bureau stationed at the Denver headquarters began to study the details of the plan based on this contract, and Chinese engineers in Denver assisted. Dr. Savage officially serves as the design engineer for China.

White Hair, Gentle and Humble Attitude

Dr. Savage has a tall figure, a white beard, and an exceptionally gentle and humble attitude. A pair of bright blue eyes are embedded in a face that has become dark due to years of outdoor work. Until last year, his annual government salary never exceeded $8,750, but Savage did not mind. He said, "I am not a shrewd businessman. I am not very interested in money."

Savage was born on Christmas Day in 1879 on a small farm near Kirksville, Wisconsin. After growing up, he studied engineering at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. Shortly after graduating, he joined the US Reclamation Bureau.

Savage's first project was the water management project on the Snake River in southern Idaho, where working fourteen hours a day was a common occurrence for him. Several years later, a famous engineer named Whaley invited him to join his company, and the two jointly designed and built dams, inventing many novel ideas. Savage often tells people to this day, "Whaley taught me my engineering knowledge."

In 1916, Mr. Savage rejoined the US Reclamation Bureau. A few years later, he became the chief design engineer of the Denver headquarters. Savage's experience in building dams gradually became richer. In 1920, he was ordered by the government to build the Boulder Dam on the Colorado River. This was the first large dam in the world, jointly invested by the six major construction companies in the western United States, which shows the greatness of the scale. In this difficult project, Savage invented a new method of cooling 3.5 million cubic yards of cement.

During the Roosevelt era, construction plans sprung up everywhere like bamboo shoots after a rain. Savage and his colleagues intensified their work to rush out designs to meet the needs. When he was in Babbitt, he was suddenly summoned to preside over the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), serving as the chief design engineer for the Norris and Wheeler dams. He then presided over the design of the Coulee and Shasta dams. Soon, Savage's name spread all over the world, and governments around the world sent telegrams to Washington, inviting Savage to provide guidance.

The state of New South Wales in Australia was afraid that the Burrinjuck Dam there would not have an expert to manage it and that it would collapse, so it specially telegraphed Savage to attend an emergency meeting of engineers in London. Just as he was about to leave, someone discovered that there was a US law prohibiting US civil servants from accepting foreign salaries. Savage telegraphed his superiors, stating that he was willing to accept no remuneration, and then set off for London.

Later, the US Congress passed a bill in 1941 allowing the President to select Savage to go to Australia and India. He went to Australia to survey the Burrinjuck Dam. At this time, the Japanese army attacked Pearl Harbor. On his way back to the United States from Australia, Savage encountered the danger of submarines several times, but because he was busy writing reports, he did not notice these dangers.

Dam Expert Concerned About China's Problems

In 1944, Savage set off for China, passing through India and Afghanistan, and finally arrived in China's capital. He saw the possibility of the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River—which could generate 10.05 million kilowatts, ten times the power of the Boulder Dam—and all the construction projects he had undertaken in his life (including the Boulder Dam project) were insignificant.

This worldwide dam expert has always been concerned about China's problems. In his report, he said: The Yangtze River development plan can be listed as one of the great achievements in human history. He firmly believes that the completion of this plan will turn China from weak to strong.

However, those who doubt this plan say that the Chinese are too incompetent and will never be able to build this dreamlike dam. Even if they can build it, they will not use it well. However, if you ask Savage what he thinks of the abilities of Chinese engineers, he will take out the four reports he wrote in China and frankly tell you: "These reports were able to be written so completely and so quickly, entirely thanks to the help of twenty or thirty young Chinese engineers. Some of them have had construction experience in the United States, and others are still helping to complete the final design in Denver."

He also said, "There is no doubt that China has stepped into the doorway of industrial development, just like the situation in the United States decades ago. Who says that China will not succeed like us?"

### A New Strategy for the Yellow River Project: Combined Governance of the Huai River and Water Transport – A Prerequisite for National Prosperity and the People's Well-being

— Jinan Correspondence, 14th [Day of Month Unknown] - Meng Ming

The Question of the Existence or Abolition of the Southern Transport River: The transport river was the grain route used by past emperors for water transport. Since the southward move of the Song dynasty, fearing that the river route would supply the enemy, orders were issued to destroy it, and the regulations were completely abandoned. In the early Ming dynasty, the Yuan system was followed, utilizing maritime transport. Many ships were damaged, so the Earl of Pingjiang, Chen Xuan, and the Minister Song Li were assigned to manage the north and south transport rivers, with the sole purpose of transporting grain from the Jiangnan region to the capital. At the beginning of the river's construction, the terrain was not carefully examined, nor were water conservancy and the people's livelihood considered to create a perfect plan. Thus, reliance was placed on artificial manipulations, forcibly connecting the Yellow River, Huai River, Wen River, and Ji River into a single line, using the lakes of Weishan, Hongze, and Gaobao as temporary stops. The courses of the various rivers were inconsistent, with different storage and discharge capacities. Therefore, dikes, weirs, and dams were interspersed throughout, with officials and soldiers stationed to guard them day and night. However, the nature of water is difficult to control and cannot be subdued for long. Breaches, silting, and changes occur frequently, and repairs and bribes are used. Large-scale projects are repeatedly undertaken. Crossing the river, middle dikes, old dikes, the Clearwater Pond, the Gaojia Weir, the Jia River, the Middle River, the New River – famous ministers specializing in water management emerge one after another. Each project involves tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of laborers, using hundreds of thousands or millions of taels of silver, only to be repaired and destroyed again, ultimately failing to remedy the damage and blockage of the transport route. Now, with giant ships capable of sailing at will and land routes of railways already open, and the emperor's granary system no longer in place, the value of this transport river, which burdens the people and wastes resources to supply the court, really necessitates re-evaluation. The section of the transport river from Jiangdu to Huaiyin is called the Southern Transport River, and the section from Huaiyin to Weishan Lake is called the Middle Transport River. These two sections of the transport river are closely related to the management of the Yellow River. Opinions on the management of water transport are attached to this discussion. The remaining sections, being further away from the Yellow River, will not be discussed.

The West Transport River

For hundreds of years, Hongze Lake has been the tail end of the Huai River. The lakebed has become shallow due to siltation, and the water storage capacity has decreased year by year. Whenever the Huai River swells, Hongze Lake cannot contain it, and the surging waters gather into a vast inundation. Combined with the lakes of Gaobao and Shaobo, the boundless expanse stretches over three hundred *li*, reaching the horizon. Not only are the fields near the lake at risk of being submerged, but the transport dikes are often breached, flooding the Lixia River area, causing severe harm. Therefore, it is appropriate to take advantage of this time of combined governance of the Yellow and Huai rivers to thoroughly reorganize Hongze Lake and other lakes. From Yiyu (an appropriate location in the center of Hongze Lake, northeast of Dingyi) to Jiangdu, following an industrial plan, a transport river should be opened, passing through the centers of Hongze and Gaobao lakes, entering the Yangtze River in the south and connecting to the Yellow River in the north (a new route), named the West Transport River. This will allow the water from the lakes to flow into the rivers, turning the drained land into fertile soil, increasing farmland. The income from agricultural production and land prices can be used to fund the river opening. If demobilized soldiers are used to manage the river, the drained land should be allocated to them.

The East Transport River

East of the Southern Transport River, the lands of the seven counties, including Gaoyou and Shiyang, were formerly known as the Xiahe area. Therefore, there are thirty-six lakes, such as Sheyang and Guangyang, shaped like the bottom of a pot, serving as the tail ends of the Huai River and the waters from Chuzhou, Si River, and Tianchang. When the autumn water rises, all the waters flow into the Xiahe area as a ravine, day and night, flowing east beyond the transport river. However, along the coast of the East Sea, there is the Fan Gong Dike to block the sea tide. The water of the Xiahe area is then blocked and cannot enter the sea, stagnating and flowing horizontally, flooding fields and submerging villages, becoming a waterlogged area forever. Therefore, the Xiahe area suffers the most from flooding. Statistics show that the Xiahe area covers approximately 300,000 *qing*, of which 40% can be cultivated and 60% is lake area. Now that the new route of the Yellow River has been completed, and the waters of Chuzhou, Feng, Huai, and Si rivers are diverted by the West Transport River and the Yellow River into the Yangtze River and the sea, the Xiahe area will not suffer from the harm of the upper rivers. However, the accumulated water in the local area still needs to be drained. It is appropriate to connect the Yangtze River and the Yellow River (new route) by opening a new transport river, named the East Transport River, to guide the accumulated water in the Xiahe area, diverting it into the rivers. The long-term marshy land will be transformed into a land of abundant rice crops. Not only will the East Transport River be the primary thoroughfare connecting the rivers, but it will also drain over one hundred thousand *qing* of fertile land. The national revenue will also be considerable.

The Southern Transport River

The riverbed of this river is six *chi* higher than Hongze Lake and other lakes, and several *zhang* higher than the Huai River. The transport river has no source, so the water force is difficult to maintain and requires human effort to dredge. In this day and age, focusing on the management of water transport is actually more loss than gain. If the east and west transport rivers have been opened, and dredging water for navigation proves obviously effective, then there is no need to expend vast amounts of manpower and money to undertake large-scale construction. Only slight dredging should be done to maintain the passage of small boats. However, the salt-producing areas of Gaobao and Xingtai have traditionally relied on the opening and closing of culverts in the transport dikes to irrigate their fields. Therefore, it is appropriate to utilize the transport dikes to regulate the water volume to increase the benefits of irrigation. The Yellow River, Yangtze River, East Transport River, and West Transport River form a square area. Surrounded by these four rivers, there must be abundant water conservancy. Within this square area, several east-west parallel canals should be excavated, starting from the West Transport River and ending at the East Transport River. Branch canals and ditches should extend throughout the fields, drawing water from the West Transport River and transporting it into the canals to irrigate all the fields. The culverts on the Southern Transport River dikes should be opened and closed in a timely manner to regulate the water volume in the Lixia River area. Rain and drought should be managed according to the situation, with storage and discharge controlled by people. The area of thousands of *li* between the Yangtze and Huai rivers, which used to suffer from continuous flooding, will now have intersecting canals, with fertile land visible everywhere, becoming a prosperous land of fish and rice, with abundant wealth, comparable to Jiangnan.

The Middle Transport River

During the Ming dynasty, the transport route from Huaiyin to Weishan Lake utilized the Yellow River to facilitate water transport. In order to avoid the dangers of the Lüliang area, Li Hualong opened the Jia River during the Wanli era, from Hanzhuang to Shuzhi River Estuary, avoiding over three hundred *li* of danger on the Yellow River. Ultimately, the section of the Yellow River from Zao River to Qingkou remained dangerous and difficult, causing congestion in transport. During the Kangxi era, the Middle River was also excavated. The Jia River and the Middle River combined to form the Middle Transport River. Observing the motivation for opening the river, it was entirely supplementary in nature. Dredging and silting occurred repeatedly, and the dredging was extremely labor-intensive. Moreover, between Hanzhuang and Tai'erzhuang, a distance of eighty *li*, nine gates were placed, which is evidence of the uneven terrain. Artificial manipulation makes navigation inconvenient. It is also inadvisable to undertake large-scale construction projects, which would burden the people and harm the country. Slight dredging to allow small boats to pass is sufficient. However, to connect the north and south transport rivers, it is appropriate to open a transport river northward from the mouth of the West Transport River in Yiyu, utilizing the waters of the Bian River, Si River, and their tributaries, passing through Xuzhou to enter Weishan Lake. The old mouth of the Hanzhuang canal should be dammed to allow Weishan Lake to store water throughout the year, to facilitate water transport. Further north, the waters of the Wen River and Si River should be used to connect to Linqing and Tianjin. The area between Hanzhuang, Huaiyin, and Yiyu forms a triangular area surrounded by the Yellow River (new route), the Middle Transport River, and the New Middle Transport River. Several east-west canals can also be opened to facilitate irrigation and drainage. Between Xuzhou and Si River, for hundreds of *li*, mulberry and hemp fields, rice and japonica rice fields are intertwined, transforming the desolate area into a prosperous region.

The place where the transport river and the Yellow River meet is called the Yun Kou (Transport Mouth). The water of the transport river is weak, and the water of the Yellow River is strong. Therefore, the water of the Yellow River often backflows into the Yun Kou. When the Yellow River water enters the transport river, the water force is dispersed, the downstream flow slows, and silt accumulates, causing blockage. When the downstream is blocked, the upstream breaches. The backflow of the Yellow River into the Yun Kou causes great harm and must be prevented. At each location where the transport river enters the Yellow River, the use of an upward angle should be avoided, and a downward angle should be used instead, so that the water of the Yellow River and the transport river converges and flows downward, preventing backflow and its associated harms.

### Recruiting Labor: Three Sources

The Yellow River management plan includes the management of the Huai River and water transport. The project is grand, requiring a large number of laborers for long-term work. For the method of recruiting laborers, special provisions should be formulated to ensure organized structure, flexible command, and efficient work. The sources of laborers are divided into the following three categories:

(A) Demobilized Soldiers

The current military restructuring has already begun. Demobilized soldiers can be assigned to river management work. In the future, the success of river management will lead to the reclamation of a significant amount of new land upstream and downstream. Land should be allocated to individuals so that demobilized soldiers have land to return to.

(B) Conscripted Labor

Several tens of thousands of laborers should be conscripted from within a certain number of *li* on both sides of the river. They should provide their own tools. The *baojia* system should be used as the organization for conscripting labor. Work time should be limited to the morning. The work area should be limited to the completion of river works near their residence. The government should provide subsidies to show consideration.

(C) Disaster Relief Labor

If a certain area in the country suffers from water or drought disasters, resulting in famine and food shortages, residents who lack food can be recruited and transported to the worksite. This is disaster relief labor. The tools they use should be brought by the disaster relief laborers as much as possible. The government should provide food and lodging, which is a form of work-for-relief. When the fields in their original hometown are ripe, they should be allowed to resign from work and return home to harvest, without being detained.

In ancient times, river management was mostly overseen by officials who sought to achieve results in order to be recommended for promotion, without regard for the suffering of the people. The laborers they recruited were treated like cattle and horses, and supervision was strict, with the sole aim of completing the project as soon as possible. The food, drink, and lodging of the laborers were not the concern of the officials. Consequently, many suffered from diseases due to hunger, cold, and overwork, and died in the workplace, without anyone paying attention. Every time I read history to this point, I am deeply saddened. Now, our country is called the Republic of China, and the world is moving towards great unity. When large-scale projects must be undertaken, and the people are made to work hard, enduring the elements, it is all for the benefit of the nation. Therefore, the nation should provide appropriate protection for the health of the laborers. The establishment of river work hospitals and the like is necessary.

The Yellow River management project is vast, and the required funds are enormous. Some may doubt that the country has the financial capacity to bear such a large sum after the great war. This concern is clearly inappropriate. Now, I will offer further explanation to dispel their doubts. After Da Yu tamed the floods, the Yellow River remained peaceful for over a thousand years. By the Zhou dynasty, there were instances of breaches. During the Han dynasty, there were eight breaches of the river. The breach at the Huzi estuary during the reign of Emperor Wu was the most severe. Wang Jing's management of the Yellow River during the Eastern Han dynasty was quite effective. During the Three Kingdoms, the Two Jins, the Sui, and the Tang dynasties, river disasters were rare. During the Five Dynasties, the river breached more than ten times. During the Northern Song dynasty, there were forty-seven or eight breaches. During the Yuan dynasty, there were nineteen breaches. During the Ming dynasty, there were thirty-six breaches. River disasters were also frequent during the Qing dynasty, ultimately leading to the diversion of the river at Fenglan, returning to the Bohai Sea. The above are all large-scale breaches recorded in historical records. Among them, there were also instances of several breaches in one year or one breach in several years, requiring the mobilization of tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people to block them. Some breaches took one or two years to close, while others took several years to close. The longest took more than twenty years to close. In addition to blocking breaches, there were also annual repair projects. As the saying goes, "Treasury funds are wasted on annual repairs, and the people dread blocking breaches," yet even then, one year of peace cannot be guaranteed. It is truly lamentable. If we thoroughly calculate the losses of life and property caused by river breaches, as well as the waste of materials, labor, and levies during river closure, we will know how enormous the losses from river disasters are and how deep the suffering inflicted on the people is. Moreover, since the late Qing dynasty, with the corruption of politics and the deception of superiors and subordinates, river official positions have become lucrative posts, and river works have become sources of profit. As a result, river defenses have deteriorated greatly, with dangerous worksites everywhere. It is even more impossible to ask about them. If repairs are not made in a timely manner, it is simply treating human lives like grass. The harm is unimaginable. At this time when the whole country is advocating for construction, the Yellow River should be thoroughly repaired once and for all.

Yellow River management is a century-long plan for the nation. Combined governance of the Huai River and water transport, stretching for thousands of *li*, is also one of the world's major projects. Because the project is grand, detailed investigation, research, surveying, and measurement should be conducted first, with technical discussions to compare gains and losses, advantages and disadvantages. Then, a plan should be formulated, a construction schedule should be prepared, and progress should be made step by step, following the proper order. Without seeing small profits, without rushing for immediate results, success will not be difficult to achieve, benefiting the country and the people, and providing endless benefits. Now, I will add a few points below: (1) Since the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, the focus on the Yellow River has not been on river management, but only on river defense, which can be called a river defense policy, far from the true meaning of river management. The discussion in this article aims to thoroughly manage the entire river from beginning to end, once and for all. However, individual intelligence is limited. I sincerely hope that social elites will rise up to discuss and research, so that the river management plan is sound and usable. (2) The discussion in this article is all about principles. As for detailed plans, such as whether the Yellow River's mouth into the sea should use the Guan River estuary or the old Yellow River estuary, and whether a certain section of the Huai River should be straightened, etc., experts must be waited on to formulate them. (3) Since the War of Resistance, the trenches dug by the national army in various places, the traffic trenches opened by local troops, and the obstruction ditches dug by the enemy puppets in railways and towns, if the total number is calculated, may be larger than the Yellow River diversion project. Also, the mountain caves dug by the enemy army in various important strongholds to store military supplies are larger in scale than the project of excavating the Niaoshu Mountain. It can be seen that as long as the Yellow River management project concentrates its forces, it will definitely succeed. The above plans should not be made difficult to do because the project is huge, and the psychology of complacency should not be generated. It must be given great wisdom and great courage, and put into practice. It must be known that if the Yellow River is not managed for a long time and the Yellow River breaches, the losses to the country will definitely be no less than the river management funds.

This time, I went to Beijing to report and attend the preparatory meeting for the National Assembly, which was held twelve times and adjourned on the 13th. An adjournment speech was given. During the adjournment period, all affairs are handled by the secretariat. A second preparatory meeting will be held when necessary. In other words, before the opening of the National Assembly, the organization of this preparatory meeting will not be eliminated. "Adjournment" only means that the general meeting is not open for the time being.

### Report from Beijing

— Zhu Fengwei

Approximately 500 National Assembly representatives have reported to Beijing this time, exceeding half of the total number of popularly elected representatives. Their regions include overseas Chinese, Tibet, Mongol Banners, Gansu, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Henan, Fujian, Shandong, Xikang, Jiangxi, Qinghai, Anhui, Xinjiang, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Shanghai Municipality, Nanjing Municipality, and 30 national-level units for lawyers, accountants, doctors, journalists, and educators. Each unit nominates one chairman and one to three executive officers to form two organizations: the presidium and the executive committee. The executive committee operates under the direction of the presidium, handling affairs through seven groups, including general affairs, documentation, and finance. The presidium meets one hour before each general assembly session to organize the agenda for the day, appoint seven chairmen to preside over the session, and then those seven chairmen appoint one overall chairman (on a rotating basis, cyclical and repetitive). These four to five hundred representatives have come from all over the country, traversing thousands of mountains and rivers. Although the official opening date of the National Assembly remains pending, the preparatory meetings are sufficient to demonstrate the spirit of unity and the powerful capabilities of the representatives of the entire nation, and the results are excellent, which is truly fortunate.

Since the assembly has been adjourned, everything is in the past. However, one matter seems worth further recounting: the visits. The visits were divided into two groups: one group to visit General Marshall, with Zhu Jingnong, Xi Yushu, Zhang Jingyu, and Hu Jingan nominated as the four representatives. Apparently, the collection of evidence of the Communist army's ravaging of Shandong and northern Jiangsu was incomplete, causing a delay in its implementation. The other group nominated Lin Hu, Huang Zhida, Su Cunpu, He Bingru, Jia Hongzhu, and myself (I, the undersigned, being the convener) to visit Shao Lizi, Wu Tiecheng, Chen Cheng, Chen Lifu, and Zhang Lisheng. (These five seem to be government representatives to the Political Consultative Conference, with Sun Ke, Zhang Qun, and Chen Bulei as three others, all not in Beijing at this time. If I am correct, it should be Wang Shijie instead of Chen Cheng.) The objectives of the visit included: (1) The reasons for the postponement of the convocation of the National Assembly. (2) If the postponement is indefinite, to what date or time will it be extended? (3) Should the representatives who have come to Beijing continue to report and be accommodated? (4) To urge the government to set a date for the convocation of the assembly as soon as possible, and to appeal to the government to immediately recover the northeastern provinces, quell the war in Shandong and northern Jiangsu, unify the country, return power to the people, and implement constitutional governance. Due to time and business constraints, the visits to the five individuals were spread over three days: The first day was a visit to Zhang Lisheng, Minister of Interior and Chief Supervisor of National Assembly elections. The second day involved visiting Shao Lizi, Chairman of the National Assembly Preparatory Committee and Central Standing Committee Member Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General of the Central Party Headquarters. The third day was a visit to Chen Lifu, Minister of Central Organization and member of the National Assembly Preparatory Committee, and Minister of Military Affairs Chen [blank].

Minister Zhang's Words were Gentle and Sincere

We visited Zhang Lisheng at the Ministry of Interior, and Minister Zhang's attitude and language were exceptionally sincere. He spoke excellent Beijing dialect, crisp and clear. All six of us representatives spoke in turn. Zhang listened attentively to the statements of the six representatives and then provided a comprehensive response. He said:

"Representatives, you have come to Beijing to report, traveling arduously and enduring great hardship. On the 25th, we suddenly saw the government's order indefinitely postponing the assembly date, which naturally caused resentment. This action, from the government's perspective, certainly has unavoidable difficulties, but losing faith with the representatives is difficult to excuse. Therefore, it would be best if the representatives could forgive the government; otherwise, if you wish to condemn the government, the government will accept it without argument. However, please do not condemn other parties, as that would increase the government's difficulties and would not benefit the National Assembly itself. Although the National Assembly has been postponed indefinitely, judging from the situation, it should not be too far off. Your opinions will naturally be conveyed to the government, and the government will certainly find ways to resolve the difficulties and obstacles so that the National Assembly can convene as soon as possible. Now that representatives from various provinces have already arrived in Beijing, the government would be embarrassed to ask the representatives to return and cannot simply stop providing accommodations. On this point, you can rest assured. I am one of the responsible individuals handling this matter and must express my apologies to you all!"

We felt that Minister Zhang's words were gentle and sincere. After listening to his response, we could not help but express partial satisfaction amidst our dissatisfaction. We then left the Ministry of Interior and headed to Langya Road to visit Shao Lizi, Chairman of the National Assembly Preparatory Committee and the government representative to the Political Consultative Conference who had the most contact with the Communist Zhou Enlai.

Chairman Shao's Answer Missed the Point

Mr. Shao and I are old friends, and Lin Yinqing (Hu) is also well acquainted with Shao. However, today we are discussing official business, so let's speak seriously. We reiterated to Shao what we had said to Zhang Lisheng, particularly emphasizing the tone, and questioned the government's concession to the demands of a small number of parties, even to the point of indefinitely postponing the National Assembly, losing faith with the people of the entire nation, and the failure of the Political Consultative Conference. How will the government handle the Communist army's occupation of Changchun and harassment of northern Jiangsu and Shandong? Will it allow them to run rampant and tolerate them to the end? However, Mr. Shao's response addressed the first part of the matter by speaking about the past, while the second part of his answer missed the point. He said, "Of the 38 representatives to the Political Consultative Conference, only 10 supported the validity of the representatives elected in 1936. The government worked painstakingly to give up 260 of the 460 Central Committee seats and added 440 more, totaling 700, to be distributed among the various parties, in order to gain recognition of the validity of the old representatives. As for the indefinite postponement of the National Assembly, it was because the various parties had not submitted their lists of representatives by April 24th, which forced the government to announce the postponement. At the same time, it instructed election offices nationwide to notify the representatives to halt their journeys and temporarily postpone reporting. Now, the representatives are coming to Beijing one after another and holding preparatory meetings, which is really without legal basis. Judging from the situation, it seems unlikely that the assembly can be convened before autumn. The government cannot provide long-term accommodations and should ask the representatives to return temporarily. It's like inviting guests, but the host's dishes are not ready, so he asks for a postponement. It's also like a company calling a shareholders' meeting, but too many shareholders are absent, so the manager announces a postponement. Both are normal and not surprising. As for the Political Consultative Conference, it was absolutely successful, and the future of the political situation is absolutely optimistic..."

The six representatives, having heard this, were extremely indignant. What Shao said did not sound like a member of the Kuomintang Central Committee, let alone the Chairman of the National Assembly Preparatory Committee. We refuted Shao's words one by one. The main point was that the preparatory meeting was based on the government's scheduled convocation of the National Assembly. To prepare everything before the assembly, how could it be described as "without legal basis"? Then, how could the Political Consultative Conference be considered to have legal basis? Representatives from various provinces and cities cannot be summoned and dismissed by the government at will. The representatives will not return until the assembly is convened. People across the country see the Political Consultative Conference as a failure, yet you alone arbitrarily claim it to be a success, truly possessing a unique perspective. The analogy of inviting guests and holding shareholders' meetings is inappropriate. Even with inviting guests and holding meetings, one cannot simply break faith. The Communist army is attacking and seizing territory everywhere, slaughtering the people, yet you do not mention it at all, which is truly unexpected. The two sides debated back and forth, but ultimately we achieved no resolution. The six representatives returned to report to the assembly, all indignant, which led to the scene of accusations erupting during Mr. Shao's tea reception for all the representatives on the afternoon of the sixth.

Chairman Chiang Adopted the Opinions of the Masses

At 7:00 a.m. on the morning of the sixth, Mr. Shao visited me at the Political Academy dormitory. Having been friends with Mr. Shao for thirty years, I informed him that the overall impression of him among the representatives was extremely negative. I advised him to consider his words carefully when speaking at the afternoon tea reception. Shao agreed and visited Representative Lin Yinqing (Hu) for tea, and Lin also advised him in the same way. Unexpectedly, Shao still stubbornly insisted on his own views at the tea reception and reiterated what he had said in response to the six representatives. (Mr. Chen Lifu was sitting next to me at the time. Hearing Shao's words, he stamped his feet and said repeatedly, "This is terrible, what should we do?") This aroused the resentment of all the representatives, and accusations erupted, creating a tumultuous scene that shook the roof tiles, almost preventing Mr. Shao from escaping. In all fairness, Shao insulted others and was then insulted himself, bringing it upon himself. (At 4:00 p.m. on the afternoon of the seventh, Chairman Chiang held a tea reception for all the representatives at the Lixing Society. The Chairman's attitude was gentle and sincere. He did not advise the representatives to return, nor did he say that the preparatory meeting was without legal basis. He also said that the convocation of the National Assembly would not be too far off. If the representatives had any opinions on national affairs, they could submit them in writing, and he (the Chairman, referring to himself) would do his best to adopt and accept them within the scope of what was possible! This shows that Shao's stubbornness was indeed a misstep.)

Minister Chen Dedicated Himself to National Affairs

At 3:00 p.m. on the afternoon of the sixth, we visited Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng at the Central Party Headquarters. Wu's attitude was modest, and he expressed acceptance of the representatives' statements. His key words were, "If there is peace, the National Assembly should convene. If there is no peace, the National Assembly should still convene. Therefore, the date of the National Assembly's convocation will not be too far off..." The six representatives felt satisfied and left.

At 8:00 a.m. on the morning of the seventh, we visited Minister of Central Organization Chen Lifu at his residence for a two-hour conversation. Mr. Chen Lifu was refined and elegant, and his discussions of the current situation were insightful and to the point. He deeply agreed with what the six representatives had stated and promised to convey it to the government and adopt it as much as possible. He also deeply believed that the "Political Consultative Conference had failed" and was anxious about the impending unmanageable turn of events, and he considered the government's repeated tolerance to be a misstep.

At 7:00 p.m. on the afternoon of the seventh, we visited Minister of Military Affairs General Chen Cixiu (Cheng) at his residence on Pudu Road for a long two-hour conversation. General Chen, not yet fifty, already had graying temples, showing his hard work and dedication to national affairs. He said that an army general's monthly salary was 120,000, and his wife (Miss Tan Zu'an's daughter, named Xiang) pawned her jewelry to help with household expenses, barely making ends meet. He said that the military downsizing and reorganization was being strictly implemented, and even the units of Yan Baichuan in Shanxi and Lu Han in Yunnan had been greatly reduced, which involved a great deal of trouble. Chen studied land administration and had gained considerable insight. He accepted all the statements of the six representatives and lamented the Communist Party's ambition and the Communist army's attacks and harassment, deeply fearing that mutual tolerance would not serve the nation.

### Shanghai Boys Town

— Zifang

——A big family for homeless children

The eight-year-long war destroyed countless peaceful and sweet families, and as a result, many homeless children living on the streets increased, in addition to begging for food, many of them were engaged in criminal activities. They not only hinder the appearance of the city and disrupt social order, but are also a great loss to the country; because there are no incorrigible bad children in the world, as long as these children are reasonably educated and taught life skills, they can become good and useful citizens. In the United States, this cause of educating and nurturing homeless children has achieved excellent results, and this organization is called "Boys Town."

In Cleveland, Ohio, there are six Boys Towns, with three thousand citizens aged eight to ten. They were all abandoned by their parents, their parents are either dead or divorced, and there are many who cannot afford to raise their children.

The village has police, courts, mayors, newspapers, music teams, factories, clubs, sports fields, ballrooms, and photography associations, all of which are staffed, organized and managed by teenagers or children. The teenagers and children in the village work and play together in their spare time every day, practicing cooperation and learning to abide by the law. In Boys Town, they gain new interests, new habits, and form new personalities and good social adaptability.

In 1937, there were 2,111 juvenile crime cases in Cleveland, but since Boys Town, the number of juvenile crime cases has been reduced to an average of 235 cases per year.

This is a miracle, but this miracle can happen in the United States, why can't it happen in China, in Shanghai? Therefore, recently, the Huisheng Charity Society and the Jingye Nursing Home jointly initiated the establishment of the "Shanghai Boys Town", and invited Lu Meiseng, Bi Fanyu, Zhao Puchu, and Tian Gengxin to be preparatory committee members to actively carry out the work. The Huisheng Charity Society allocated more than 100 mu of land in Dachang as the village site, and received support from Madame Chiang Song Meiling, General Wedemeyer, Deputy Mayor He De'kui, etc. On the 16th of last month, a board of directors meeting was held at the YMCA to discuss and approve the charter of Boys Town, and Lu Meiseng was elected as the chairman and Zhao Puchu as the village chief. It is admirable that Dong Hefu Guangsheng donated 20 million yuan on the spot as the funds for Boys Town, and Mr. Dong Shixu Guomao generously agreed to take on the salary of the director of education for a long time.

In the past and present, all children's nurseries in Shanghai only provided ordinary and outdated education to those homeless and criminal children they adopted. This kind of educational work is not enough. Boys Town has specially hired experts to organize an education committee to study how to implement education and determine the education plan. Their educational principles are to reduce forced indoctrination and encourage inspiration, to replace strict supervision with trust and love, to eliminate the existing bad behaviors and habits of homeless and criminal children, as well as anti-social and inferiority complexes, and to cultivate the spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation, so that they can become self-respecting, self-reliant, and autonomous good citizens.

In the Baohua Temple in Dachang, Shanghai Boys Town is now being pioneered by two teachers and six children. It is believed that in the near future, these more than 100 mu of barren land will be reclaimed into a paradise for homeless children, and a sweet and warm big family will be built.

Family

### From a Family Tragedy to Establishing a Sound Family Life

— Furen

According to a local newspaper report on the 20th, Ms. Cheng Wang, a young woman from Anhui Province, 29 years old, married Mr. Cheng, a bank clerk from the same hometown, in 1937. Their relationship was quite harmonious after marriage, and they had two sons. Unfortunately, this good time did not last long. Cheng went to cabarets and dance halls and met a hostess named Zhu. He rented a house to live with her. His wife found out and tried to dissuade him, but to no avail. The other day, they had an argument over this matter again. Wang became angry and bought four opium pills, took two privately, and ordered her two children to take the other two. The younger child died of poisoning, and Ms. Wang is still in critical condition, it is said.

From the family tragedy performed by Cheng, we can think of social and ethical issues. The main cause of this tragedy was Cheng's undisciplined behavior and improper associations, which led to the wife's suicide attempt due to her husband's affair. If he could have thought that he was a married man, and should have devoted all his energy to his career and family, loved his wife, and increased the joy of family life, then this unfortunate event would not have happened. Moreover, Cheng already has two children, shouldn't he have thought about the importance of his responsibility for raising his children, and still be able to seek new love?

I remember Dr. Zhang Boling said in a speech: "To build a happy family, both husband and wife must be able to coordinate, understand, and forget each other's shortcomings, and always think of each other's strengths." This is indeed experienced advice that can be used as a good saying for modern families. Take Cheng for example, his relationship with his wife was not bad at first, and they lived in peace, but eventually he became tired of his wife over time and could not resist the temptation of the bad social environment, and embarked on the wrong path. It is human nature to like the new and dislike the old. Many husbands can still love their wives at first, but later they often change their original intention and turn to love other women. In this unreasonable society, women seem to be seen as playthings for entertainment and recreation in the minds of most men. A man can love several women without being criticized or sanctioned by social opinion. This poisonous influence of "valuing men over women" is often enough to destroy the organization of a sound family. Why are women willing to associate with or even cohabitate with married men? That's because a man can love several women without being regarded as a crime, and at the same time, due to the lack of true equality in knowledge and skills between men and women, women's fate is always more miserable. Marriage or cohabitation with men is sometimes the only way for a woman to solve the problem of life. One is to exchange money for "love" (such love is certainly not true love), and the other is to exchange beauty for supplies. In this case, the moral standards of society are lowered, and the happiness of families is deprived.

To remedy this defect, on the one hand, we must change people's incorrect and unreasonable views on both sexes and promote the realization of a true monogamous system. We not only hope that the law stipulates a monogamous system, but also have to shift the bad social customs in ethical concepts. Establish appropriate and normal relationships between the sexes. On the other hand, we demand the establishment of a sound family life, improve the adaptability of both sexes to family life, and enable husband and wife to maintain eternal harmony and continue their love life. To achieve this, we must first cultivate a sound psychology between husband and wife and strive for adaptation and improvement in life. The words of Dr. Zhang Boling mentioned above are worth remembering, especially for husbands, to recognize the profound responsibility they bear to society and family, and to look farther and bigger, and never covet temporary happiness and leave eternal regret!

As for wives, they should also put the entire family first. If the husband has an affair, they may sincerely advise the husband and try to increase the atmosphere of harmony and happiness in the family, and shift the husband's interest to his career and family. An ideal wife can certainly make her husband have a concern for his children and can make her husband satisfy the needs of family life. There are many women who often quarrel with their husbands. Even if the husband has done something wrong, if you want to persuade him with anger, the result will not only be ineffective, but will also cause resentment. I think sincerity can move people, as the saying goes, "Sincerity moves even metal and stone." If you use true feelings to transform a person, you are not afraid of not being able to make his heart moved. Also, wives must carefully study why their husbands are indifferent to them, why they are dissatisfied with their current family life, and why they want to have an affair. If these parents are considered, at least they can also try to remedy them and seek closeness and understanding between each other.

Like Cheng Wang, who sought suicide due to a momentary quarrel and driven by a fire of resentment, and even poisoned her two children to death, she may not have thought it through. This is really not a smart way. This is a "settled" passive behavior, and an extreme expression of weakness. It is even more unspeakable to commit suicide oneself and also commit suicide with children. The biggest of her motives is to reach silent resistance by "dying together" due to resentment. There is really a kind of revenge in it. There is no mother who does not love her own children, but when she is desperate (in fact, that can be regarded as despair) she can only endure the pain to sacrifice and disregard everything. And she may also think this way: You go and have fun with the newcomer, I am not worthy of your love, the children are born by me, I will leave you and accompany them to leave you together. When a person's emotions are particularly agitated and stimulated the most severely, emotions cannot control emotions, and a big mistake will be made. Anger, jealousy, disappointment, and frustration destroyed a young woman in her prime, and even destroyed her children. But she never thought about how tragic this was. The husband is certainly not good, but the children are always innocent.

In short, in order to avoid the occurrence of similar tragedies, we must not entrust this responsibility to the law. We must create a strong public opinion in society, shift social customs, and establish a correct and harmonious relationship between husband and wife in ethical concepts. At the same time, we can also more believe that establishing a sound family life is the most effective way to solve all family disputes and unfortunate events.

### Buddhist Grandma

— Baling

"Buddhist grandma, really confused; doesn't eat meat, only eats vegetables; lights candles in the morning; does homework at night; uses copper coins, doesn't count; in the end, the family property is broken; the husband is sick, worships mud goddesses; the son is sick, eats incense ash; the husband is dead, the son is also gone; can't think of a way, goes to drown in the river; Buddhist grandma, asks for hardship."

This is a very accurate nursery rhyme describing the superstition of women. In Chinese society, due to the underdevelopment of women's education, most women, especially women in rural areas, are unwilling to trust doctors for medical treatment, and only worship mud Buddhas, and as a result, not only spend a lot of unjust money, but also send the patient's life, which is really an extremely pathetic thing.

Profession

### Suzhou's Female Sedan Chair Carriers

— Junyi

Anyone who has visited the Dengwei and Tianping Mountains in Suzhou knows that there is a type of mixed-gender sedan chair service there, soliciting tourists going up the mountains along the way. Those engaged in this profession are all farmers from the nearby foothills. During the period when plum blossoms bloom and peaches fall, before the fields become busy, they take advantage of this free time to use carrying sedan chairs as their sole side business in the spring, in order to supplement the family's income for the year. Among them, there are not a few who carry a single sedan chair as a family unit, such as father-in-law and daughter-in-law, mother-in-law and daughter, or husband and wife. With the pairing of male and female, locals call it the "Bagua (Eight Trigrams) Chair." Although the structure of the chair is simply a rattan chair installed between two bamboo poles, adding the weight of the passenger, it also weighs between one and two hundred catties. Because these women usually work in the fields and wade in water, they are accustomed to the training. When carrying the chair, they appear effortless. Even robust women with abundant hair can often support a load of over a hundred catties on their shoulders, walking swiftly between the city and the countryside. It can be seen that the pampered upbringing of Suzhou women does not apply to rural women.

When I went to Suzhou last month, I took a trip to Tianping Mountain. According to a female sedan chair carrier, since the War of Resistance, this year has been the most prosperous in terms of tourists. The price they charge is calculated by mileage, and they must also collect snack money along the way. Each person earns approximately fifteen to sixteen thousand yuan per day. If there is not much rain, they can even earn twenty to thirty thousand. Speaking of their demands for snack money, it is akin to extortion. If one refuses to pay, they will stop you halfway and not proceed, forcing the sitter to grudgingly pay a certain amount. Some tourists who are familiar with the situation specify in advance that the fee includes everything, and they can do nothing about it.

In the midst of the high-pitched promotion of women's occupational movement, we should naturally admire these female sedan chair carriers who are hardworking and resilient and rely on their own strength to earn a living. Although tourists inevitably feel resentment due to their unreasonable demands, they are ultimately much more refined than the general unearned-gain merchants. Moreover, they have not received any education at all and should be forgiven leniently!

### Taiwan's Massage

— Naifan

The twilight in Taiwan is relaxing and cool. The quiet asphalt road, the yellow sand that flew during the day, has already been cleansed by the tropical wind. Tall coconut trees stand tall in the night, like giant statues. At this time, there will be short flute sounds, light, clear, and melancholic, passing into your ears. These sounds rise and fall, and are definitely not the chanting of poets, nor the playing of wanderers. They are a group of professionals, and their profession is massage.

Just like those fortune tellers who wander the streets of Jiangnan towns, the masseurs in Taiwan are all blind. There are men and women, and they wander the streets like ghosts, relying on a cane or being led by a child.

Taiwanese people bathe in their own homes. After bathing, massage is a kind of enjoyment. The technique of the masseurs is exceptionally skillful. They squat beside you like cats or eagles, and with their two skilled hands, delicately and precisely, knead all the joints of your body. This makes you feel like you have done a strenuous exercise, and also like you have had a comfortable sleep.

Each massage takes about half an hour. With the rise of prices, the price of each session has also risen from ten yuan to thirty yuan.

### Mother is a Green Lawn

— Zhang Saifu

Mother is a green lawn,

Children are lambs at play.

Even with insatiable demands,

She is willing to contribute

As much as possible, as much as possible.

Until withered and yellow!
