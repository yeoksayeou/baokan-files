[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] It was learned here today that the National Army recovered Xifengkou and Qian'an County, southeast of Xifengkou, on the 8th. On the 9th, Gubeikou was also recovered, and the remaining Communist troops are currently in retreat.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 10th] Sources familiar with the matter report that, as the Communist troops are still not ceasing their attacks on Datong, the National Army has decided to recover Zhangjiakou in three routes. One route is the Zheng Dongguo unit, advancing west from Rehe, which has already begun its actions. Another route is the Sun Lianzhong unit, advancing from Nankou, currently awaiting orders. The other route is the Fu Zuoyi unit, from Suiyuan, to relieve the siege of Datong and advance east in support.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 10th] Sources familiar with the matter report that an air force reconnaissance report states that the National Army, having overcome Zhuozishan in eastern Suiyuan, is continuing to advance east and has approached Jining. The vanguard troops are only five li from Jining city, where fierce fighting is currently taking place. The Jining group is still inside the city. The Military Mediation Department dispatched planes yesterday to deliver supplies. Another unit of Fu Zuoyi's National Army is heading straight for Fengzhen from Liangcheng, with the vanguard troops only tens of li from Fengzhen.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] The National Army in the areas of Zhuozishan and Dongbasumu in Suiyuan continues to advance, and arrived at the outskirts of Jining city on the afternoon of the 9th, and is now intensifying the siege.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] Refugees outside Datong city, unable to bear the Communist troops' brutality, are now continuously fleeing back into the city in large numbers.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 10th] A telegram from Datong today states that although the Communist troops continue their attacks, the situation in Datong has eased as a part of the main force of the Communist troops has gathered in Fengzhen. However, if the siege of Datong continues for a long time, there will still be a crisis. The city is about seven li in diameter, with a circumference of more than twenty li. The defending army is less than 20,000 people and has been fighting hard for more than a month, with casualties. The Northeast Advance Army of six to seven thousand people has suffered nearly two thousand casualties after hard fighting. Furthermore, there is not much food in the city. It is estimated that the military food supply can only last for another month at most, and the civilian food supply is even more difficult. Previously, the highest authorities ordered the allocation of 10,000 bags of flour to assist the military and civilians of Datong, but after transporting 1,000 bags by air, they were unable to continue transporting them. How to assist the military and civilians of Datong with food is a serious problem.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 10th] A certain military officer stated that order has been restored around Chengde, and the Jin-Cheng Railway is being repaired westward. Currently, trains can reach between Lingyuan and Pingquan. Zheng Dongguo will go to Chengde to inspect in the coming days.

### Zhang Qun Flies to America for Medical Treatment, Leaves Shanghai Yesterday on a Military Special Plane

[Our Newspaper] Chairman Zhang Qun of Sichuan flew to America yesterday morning for medical treatment. Zhang's family told reporters that Zhang had a small tumor below his right ear, and later learned that it was cancer, so he went abroad for treatment. According to Zhang's family, Zhang had surgery for this disease, and the pain was not very severe. Although Zhang has taken a three-month leave for his trip abroad, it still depends on the treatment situation.

It cannot be cured without deep X-ray examination. There is no such equipment in the country, so he had to go to the United States for treatment. According to those close to Zhang, although he felt pain after the tumor in his head was removed, his spirits were still good and his diet was normal. After arriving in Shanghai on the evening of the 9th, he had a very pleasant meeting at his private residence on Avenue Albert with important guests who came to visit, including President Song Ziwen, Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng, Wu Dingchang, and Zhang Junmai, Qian Xinzhi, and Du Yuesheng.

### American Journalists Discuss the Chinese Communist Party, Which Has Always Been a Constituent of the Third International and Has Close Ties with Moscow

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] The Washington News published an article by columnist Lamar on August 28 entitled "Is the Chinese Communist Party Really Communist?" The main points are as follows:

Some people think that the Chinese Communist Party is not a communist party, but a combination of liberals, democrats, and land reformers. However, judging from the letters from readers in the newspaper, it is generally believed that Moscow has recognized the communists in Yan'an as qualified communists. This can be proved by Moscow broadcasts and Soviet newspapers, which never recognize those who are wandering and indecisive as communists.

Until the Third International pretended to dissolve during the war, the Chinese Communists had always been a powerful constituent of the organization. Mao Zedong also served as the organization's executive committee member. In November and December of last year, the pamphlets distributed by the New York State Communist Party headquarters even listed Mao's "On New Democracy" and "Struggle for a New China" as required reading for communists, along with the works of Lenin and Stalin. Recently, Li Lisan was appointed as Lin Biao's political adviser, which is enough to show the close connection between Moscow and the Chinese Communist Party. Li came to the Northeast with the Soviet occupation army, and the Chinese Communist Party obtained the Japanese prisoners' ammunition and weapons at that time, which are now being used to carry out their war against the government. The Central Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party issued a notice, of which we have recently obtained a translation, stating that the Bureau agrees with the opinions of the Far East Bureau of the Third International, which indicates that the Third International is becoming active again.

### Jiangnan Begins to Eliminate Scattered Bandits; First Pacification Zone Conference Formulates Steps

[Our Suzhou Correspondent, 10th] The first pacification zone security conference was held in Changzhou on the 6th of this month.

### Japanese Nationals and Ryukyuans in Taiwan Province to be Repatriated This Month; 660,000 Japanese Nationals in Northeast Arrive in Japan

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 10th] The Japanese Nationals Management Committee of Taiwan Province has ordered approximately 1,800 Japanese nationals who evaded repatriation and were not approved for requisition in April to report to the county governments before the 15th to participate in the organization and await repatriation. The Committee also stipulates that those who fail to report by the deadline will be arrested by local police. According to the Committee, there are a total of 24,000 Japanese technicians and their families who are retained. Among them, 1,000 technicians and their families, totaling 5,000, will continue to be retained. The remaining 19,000 have also been decided to be repatriated in four batches, with 5,000 people transported in each batch. For several months, the issue of repatriating Japanese nationals has been discussed with the US to dispatch ships, but there have been no results. It has now been decided to use the "Tainan" ocean liner, which was repaired and docked last month, for transportation. The ship is currently sailing to Hainan Island to pick up Taiwan compatriots and will begin transporting Japanese nationals after returning to Taiwan at the end of this month.

[Another Dispatch] The 10,132 Ryukyu residents currently staying in Taiwan will be repatriated to the Great Ryukyu Island in their entirety. In April of this year, 4,000 people were transported back to their hometowns by US warships, but the US military authorities refused to allow them to land due to a food shortage on the Great Ryukyu Island, so the repatriation was stopped. The second repatriation will still be transported by US warships and is expected to begin this month, transporting 2,000 people per month. Among these 10,000 Ryukyuans, some are still residing in the Sales Center camp, and the supplies are provided by us. The remaining part mostly serve as servants here and maintain their livelihoods themselves.

### Marriage Issues Involved Amidst the Repatriation of Japanese Nationals; Executive Yuan Promulgates New Regulations

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 10th] Regarding the issue of whether Chinese-Japanese interracial couples can reside within our country's borders, the Executive Yuan has sent a telegram to this place stipulating: (1) Chinese women who marry Japanese men and lose Chinese nationality are allowed to choose to go to Japan with their husbands or stay in China themselves. (2) Chinese men and Japanese women, regardless of whether they married before or after the war, are allowed to choose to stay or leave. The same applies to Chinese men who are sons-in-law to Japanese women. The Taiwan Provincial Government previously stipulated that Japanese women who married Chinese men after August 15th of last year would still be subject to repatriation.

[United Press, Tianjin, 10th] Reports state that most of the largest Fushun Coal Mine in the Far East is currently shut down, and more than 30,000 miners are unable to make ends meet.

### Improve Facilities on Guangdong-Hankou Railway

Hou Jiayuan Suggests Loans from the United States

[Our Hankou Correspondent, 10th] According to Hou Jiayuan, head of the Executive Yuan Engineering Planning Group, who returned to Hankou from Hunan, the prospects for improving the Guangdong-Hankou Railway facilities are very optimistic. Only by strengthening the roadbed, replacing it with heavy steel rails, and rebuilding bridges can 50-ton trains be run, making it a model railway in our country. It is estimated that the total cost of improving the entire line will only be over 10 billion yuan. Therefore, it is proposed to suggest that the government borrow from the United States in order to cooperate with the bureau's renovation plan and actively implement the improvement work.

### Postal Rates Will Not Increase Before November This Year

Xu Jizhuang Firm in His Resignation

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 10th] People in the postal sector say that the post office has suffered huge losses, losing 10 billion yuan last month alone. However, postal rates are unlikely to increase before November. When they do increase in the future, the rate for regular letters may increase to 400 yuan, because according to cost accounting, this is not enough to make up for the losses. And it is not a long-term solution to rely on government subsidies. Regarding the transfer of the director, Xu Jizhuang is very firm in his resignation. The difficulty is that there is no suitable successor at the moment. It is rumored that the post and telecommunications will be merged. There may be some difficulties in implementing this. Amid the calls for layoffs from all sides, there is also talk of tightening postal services. However, the general treatment of postal workers is lower than that of ordinary civil servants, and their work is very burdensome (it is said that the current workload in the Jiangsu region has increased by 400% compared to the beginning of the rehabilitation), while the increase in personnel is only 12%, which is really not enough. Therefore, it is hoped that the authorities will carefully consider this.

### Verdict Announced in the Chang Donge Case; Two Perpetrators Sentenced to Imprisonment

[Our Suzhou Correspondent, 10th] Huang Zhaochuan and Yu Jishan, former section chiefs of the Suzhou Direct Branch of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau, were guilty of dereliction of duty and corruption, leading to the suicide of the young woman Chang Donge.

More than 100 people were in court to listen, including the Women's Association, the Chang An Aftermath Support Association, reporters from various newspapers, and the public. Judge Wang rose to the bench and ordered Huang and Yu to be brought forward. Their faces were pale, their expressions fearful, and they stood respectfully before the public case, listening quietly to the verdict. Judge Wang stood up and read the main text: Huang Zhaochuan took advantage of his position to defraud property and was sentenced to three years and six months of imprisonment and deprived of public rights for three years. Yu Jishan helped to take advantage of his position to defraud property and was sentenced to one year and nine months of imprisonment and deprived of public rights for two years.

### Negotiations on Manufacturing Railway Vehicles in Japan Completed Pending Approval; China to Supply High-Grade Industrial Coal

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 9th] Negotiations on the mass production of railway vehicles for China in Japan have been completed and are awaiting final approval from the Chinese Ministry of Efficiency. The negotiations stipulate that China will export high-grade industrial coal for use by Japanese factories and foundries. The railway vehicles they produce should be sold to China first. The Chinese government has requested that the railway vehicles be delivered within one year, but the Japanese Ministry of Commerce and Industry estimates that production and delivery will take two years, but the Chinese government still hopes that delivery can be completed within one year. The railway vehicle manufacturing plan is completely separate from the various compensation measures, and the compensation measures will take considerable time to implement one by one. According to the Chinese Mission in Japan, the plan to manufacture railway vehicles is by no means intended to allow China to take Japanese factories from Japan as compensation, keep them in Japan, and then use them to manufacture the goods needed by China. All negotiations were conducted by the Chinese Mission in Japan and the Industrial Section of the Economic and Scientific Group of the Allied Headquarters. Which Japanese company and factory will fulfill the Chinese government's orders has not yet been decided.

Editorial

### How to Dispose of a Defeated Japan?

Foreign Minister Wang Shijie, head of the Chinese delegation to the peace conference, prioritizing official duties, departed yesterday to return to China. Before his departure, he met with American and French journalists and issued a statement clarifying China's policy toward Japan. The main points are sixfold: (1) Peace in the Far East depends greatly on the success of the Paris Peace Conference; (2) Although China suffered significant losses during the war, it will not demand reparations exceeding Japan's ability to pay; (3) When drafting the peace treaty with Japan, China will not adopt a policy of retribution; (4) The policies of China and the United States toward Japan are generally the same; (5) China supports the 25-year disarmament treaty for Japan proposed by the United States; (6) Peace cannot be maintained for long if it is not based on justice; the military defeat of the defeated country is not enough to guarantee world security.

Foreign Minister Wang's statement is full of a sense of justice. His ability to be so magnanimous toward a defeated enemy has garnered the attention and respect of countries around the world, and serves as a profound satire to the representatives of certain countries in Paris who want to impose harsh conditions on the defeated nations. However, the motive for Foreign Minister Wang's statement is merely to illustrate how concerned the Chinese government is about the success or failure of the Paris Peace Conference. Because under the current international relations, if the stalemate in Europe cannot be broken, the Far East problem cannot be solved independently. In other words, if this Paris Peace Conference cannot sign peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland, then the peace treaty with Japan cannot be drafted. Although peace with Japan is theoretically simpler than peace with Germany, it will not be easy to solve if the relations between the great powers, especially between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, cannot be improved. The reason why Foreign Minister Wang supported the postponement of the United Nations General Assembly to October 23 at the Foreign Ministers' Meeting was nothing more than to urge politicians and diplomats from all countries to pay special attention to the Paris Peace Conference and concentrate their efforts so that the Paris Peace Conference could be successfully concluded as soon as possible.

Japan formally surrendered to the Allied forces on September 3 of last year, and surrendered to China on September 9. It has been exactly one year since then. Under the control of General Douglas MacArthur, Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, defeated Japan has been able to steadily move towards the goals of the Allied control of Japan. Whether it is the dismantling of military forces, the elimination of defenses, the closure of munitions industries, the reorganization of heavy industry, the democratization of politics, or the re-education of the people to completely eliminate the aggressive ideology of the Japanese people, considerable achievements have been made. However, the problems that arise are: first, the Japanese people have not fully awakened and still do not admit defeat, and still believe that they can make a comeback in a few decades and appear on the international stage. Second, the peace treaty with Japan has not yet been drafted. Although the U.S. State Department has been collecting materials to prepare for the drafting of the peace treaty with Japan, looking ahead to the future of the world, it is not known when the Far East Peace Conference will be opened. Third, the policies of the United States and the Soviet Union toward Japan are completely diametrically opposed, even incompatible. The United States' control of Japan has been remarkably successful, and China and the United Kingdom have unanimously praised it; however, the Soviet Union has consistently expressed dissatisfaction and often attacked MacArthur for condoning Japan and fueling the rise of Japanese aggression. Fourth, the Korean issue, according to the declaration of the three foreign ministers in Moscow, Korea has been divided into two, with the north under Soviet control and the south under American control. How to achieve unity in the future in terms of economy and politics is indeed the most difficult problem.

China does not adopt a policy of revenge against defeated Japan, but can be magnanimous, which is commendable in terms of morality; however, we must pay attention that "magnanimity" is not "indulgence", let alone "appeasement". If we want to maintain peace in the Far East, we should always guard against Japan's rearmament and always pay attention to the rise of Japanese aggression. The most urgent problem for people is how to control Japan after the signing of the peace treaty with Japan. All of this should be considered before drafting the peace treaty. In particular, MacArthur issued a message on the first anniversary of Japan's surrender on September 3, saying: "Will Japan's position in the world in the future be a fortress of peace? Or will it become a springboard for war?" This warning is aimed at the four-power control commission of China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and it is worthy of our deep consideration.

### The Future of the Palestine Problem is Pessimistic. The London Conference Opened Yesterday. Neither Arab Nor Jewish Representatives Participated. It Has Become a Conversation Between Britain and the Vassal Arab Chiefs.

[This Newspaper Report] Paris, 10th - London dispatch: The Palestine Conference opened this morning under clear skies. The area around Lancaster House was heavily guarded. Moments before 11 o'clock, the representatives of the Arab countries entered the venue, and Foreign Secretary Bevin also entered soon after. The conference began at precisely 11 o'clock. British Prime Minister Attlee delivered a speech first, receiving continuous applause that lasted for a long time before subsiding. The representatives then went to a lounge opposite the venue to rest. The lounge was decorated with a large rectangular table, adorned with a blue velvet tablecloth, red chairs, and filled with coffee cups and pots. The air was thick with the aroma of Turkish tobacco, creating a truly grand and luxurious atmosphere. As the representatives left the hall, Bevin commented, "The coffee tastes quite good." He was the first to return to the venue. A spokesperson for the Colonial Office announced at the end of this morning's meeting: The doors of Lancaster House remain open, and Jewish representatives are welcome to decide to participate at the last possible moment. The Executive Committee of the Jewish Agency met in London today. Local sources believe that the door to informal negotiations will remain open until the British government refuses to accept the Jewish counterproposal. These informal discussions can be seen as the basis for future formal meetings. However, British government officials stated that there have been too many informal talks, and the repeated holding of such informal talks should not cause people to doubt Britain's impartial and fair attitude in the Arab-Jewish conflict.

[Reuters, London, 10th] The Palestine Conference opened here today, with Prime Minister Attlee giving a speech, expressing the belief that the Palestine problem is not unsolvable. However, it requires the actions of highly skilled politicians to achieve a resolution. Representatives from neither the Palestinian Arab nor Jewish groups participated. A spokesperson for the Jewish Agency expressed doubt this morning that Jewish representatives would subsequently join the conference. When the representatives drove to the venue at Lancaster House this morning, there were few spectators, and the atmosphere was cold. The first to arrive were the representatives of Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Transjordan, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, and the United Kingdom. After Attlee finished his speech, the chief representative of Syria stood up to thank him, and the meeting was immediately adjourned for a break.

[Reuters, London, 10th] The Palestine Conference opened here today in an atmosphere of pessimism, which British officials did not attempt to conceal. While it cannot be determined at this time whether representatives of the Jewish and Arab communities in Palestine will continue to refuse to attend, this possibility is extremely high. The current question is whether any positive results can be achieved simply by exchanging views between the British government and representatives of the Arab countries. British officials believe that exchanging views with influential representatives of the Arab world may yield beneficial results. The stark reality at today's meeting is that the conference cannot be considered a success if it concludes with an agreement between Britain and the Arab countries without the presence of Jewish representatives. However, even if this conference breaks down, it will only be a formal breakdown, as Britain can still seek opinions from all relevant parties and take the most practical administrative measures. The Arab countries can also file complaints with United Nations agencies, but if this stage is reached, it would be contrary to the purpose of this conference.

[United Press, Paris, 9th] Maurice, Secretary-General of the Hebrew National Liberation Association, who is participating in the peace conference as a journalist, said: The Palestine Conference that opened in London today has been reduced to a conversation between the British government and its vassal Arab feudal chiefs. British Foreign Secretary Bevin invited Atum, the Secretary-General of the Arab League, which cannot exist under international law. How can its representatives participate in the Palestine Conference? Its resolutions must be worthless.

[Reuters, Jerusalem, 9th] Jamal al-Husseini, Deputy Chairman of the Palestinian Arab Higher Committee, went to Amman, the capital of Transjordan, at the invitation of the King of Transjordan to discuss attending the London Conference. Al-Husseini remained resolute in his intention not to attend.

### Terrorist Activities are on the Rise. Martial Law is Declared Throughout Palestine. British Troops Arrive in Haifa to Conduct Searches.

[United Press, Jerusalem, 9th] Terrorist activities in Palestine are on the rise. The British military headquarters here received a telegram from Tel Aviv tonight stating that the press office there had been destroyed. At the same time, Jewish terrorist groups announced to the newspapers today that they were responsible for yesterday's sabotage, aimed at opposing the London Conference and the British government's Palestine plan, saying that this plan would only bury peace in Palestine. Explosions and shootings occurred in various places in Palestine on the day the London Conference began, apparently as part of a large-scale Jewish terrorist operation.

[United Press, Jerusalem, 9th] Martial law has been declared throughout Palestine, and curfews are strictly enforced. Private cars are prohibited from traveling on highways. Railways have been cut and destroyed in more than fifty places, disrupting railway operations.

[Central News Agency, London, 8th, United Press] British troops are now heading to the port of Haifa in large numbers to search for the terrorists who killed a British army sergeant. 80,000 troops are now stationed in all key points in Palestine and can be mobilized at any time if necessary. Terrorist squads have been stationed at major railway stations to intercept the terrorists who widely attacked the railways early this morning and are now on the run.

### Ukraine's Accusation Rejected by British and American Representatives

[United Press, New York, 9th] The United Nations Security Council today voted nine to one to invite the Albanian representative to attend the meeting to present his views on Ukraine's accusation against Greece and Britain. British representative Jebb cast the sole dissenting vote, and Jebb criticized Ukraine's suspicion of the recent referendum in Greece as "utter nonsense." American representative Johnson also firmly rejected Ukraine's accusations with surprising actions, believing that the accusations against the Greek referendum were "not true." According to the report of the American inspectors, there were very few illegal votes, which were not enough to change the outcome of the vote.

### US Aircraft Carrier Roosevelt Sails West to Malta

Aircraft performed in Athens

The Roosevelt, weighing 45,000 tons, was docked more than 40 miles offshore. After the planes took off, they first formed another pattern and then formed the letters "F.D.R." The ship left the port of Athens yesterday morning, passing through the minefield south of Athens, and docked at sea.

[This Newspaper Report] Paris, 10th - Broadcast: The Paris Peace Conference has tentatively set October 5 as the date by which the draft peace treaties with the five former enemy countries must be completed, so that the United Nations General Assembly can be convened on October 23.

[United Press, Paris, 10th] It was learned today from reliable sources that although the Soviet Union still believes that Trieste should belong to Yugoslavia, it will abide by the agreement of the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference and internationalize the port of Trieste, and divide the Italian-South border according to the so-called French line. At the same time, it is also learned that the United States will soon notify the Italian Political Committee of its views, and it is believed that the tense stage of the Italian-South border issue is about to arrive. Yugoslavs privately admit that it is impossible to implement the country's claims, and they are well aware that the Soviet Union cannot support them.

### Committees of the Peace Conference Meet, British and American Groups Take the Offensive, Britain and Brazil Abandon Reparation Claims Against Italy, Bulgaria's Demand for Territory from Greece is Criticized as Shameless

[United Press, Paris, 9th] The peace conference has entered its seventh week, and the United Kingdom and the United States began a general offensive in various committees today, accusing the Soviet Union of wanting to give Greek territory to Bulgaria as a reward for aggression. Britain and Brazil also abandoned their direct reparation claims against Italy. Representatives from the United States, the United Kingdom, Brazil, and the Dominions spoke first in the various committees. The peace conference must end before October 20 in order to continue holding the United Nations General Assembly. Therefore, all peace treaty committees are meeting except for the Political Committee of the Finnish Treaty. South African representative Jordan praised Greece for its heroic resistance and called Bulgaria's territorial claims shameless. The British representative said that this was no different from Hungary's request for the port of Trieste as an outlet. U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith opposed the Czech encroachment on Hungary in the Hungarian Treaty Political Committee, saying that the Czech proposal to expel Hungarian minorities should be discussed, as this would establish a dangerous principle of relocating minorities. When the United Kingdom canceled its reparation claims against Italy, it reserved the right to implement Article 69 of the Italian Treaty (according to this clause, all Allied countries or their allied countries have the right to claim compensation from Italy, and may withhold or otherwise dispose of the property rights and interests of Italy or the Italian people in their own countries, and the Italian government should compensate for the property of Italians that is disposed of as a result), allowing the United Kingdom to confiscate Italian assets in Allied countries and their colonies to offset war damages. The amount has not been announced, but some British sources estimate the value of Italian assets at only £2.5 million. The peace conference continued to discuss the Italian-Yugoslav border issue at the same time, seeking to quickly complete the draft treaties of the five major Axis powers. South African representative Eichelon, Chairman of the Italian Treaty Political Territory Committee, said that although there had been a lot of talk last week, the four-power proposal to make Trieste an international free port had not changed. Eichelon argued that the issue of determining the size of the boundaries of this free port should be resolved by a subcommittee. Yugoslav representative Pable said that the South delegation intends to divide its boundary issue into four parts and suggested that another subcommittee be established, consisting of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, China, Yugoslavia, Belarus, and Brazil, to handle this issue.

### Greece Proposes Amendment to Article 1 of the Treaty with Bulgaria

[French News Agency, Paris, 9th] The Political and Territorial Committee of the Peace Conference on Bulgaria met today to discuss Article 1 of the treaty. Greek representative Pipinelis declared that, "We believe that the demands made by Bulgaria are unfair and have no basis. Regarding 'Bulgaria's outlet to the Aegean Sea', when the Lausanne Conference was held in 1923, our country had intended to grant Bulgaria certain conveniences, but this was rejected by the country. In any case, this outlet is not indispensable to Bulgaria, because its entire economic structure is tending towards Central Europe, and the Danube River and Black Sea ports are sufficient for its export needs. Our country proposes the following amendment to Article 1: 'The map attached to this treaty has indicated that the borders of Bulgaria will be the borders that existed before January 1, 1941, that is, the line from Belim - Palania - Dospat - Galek Balkan - to Dabesktipol to the Arda River Basin, which is the basis for the discussion of this committee. As for the 'freedom of the Macedonian people' claimed by Yugoslavia, it is similar to 'Hitler's terminology'." At this point, Belarusian representative Kiselev, the chairman of the committee, stopped him, saying that the last sentence was obviously insulting to the Yugoslav representative, and hoped that he would use more diplomatic language in his future speeches.

### Boundary Disputes Between Czechoslovakia and Hungary to be Studied by a Subcommittee

[Reuters, Paris, 9th] The United States today supported the Czech demand in the peace conference that Hungary cede the Cakov region on the south bank of the Danube River across from the Slovak capital Bratislava. U.S. representative Smith said that the area of the region should be slightly smaller than that demanded by the Czech Republic, so that some villages inhabited by the Magyar people would remain within Hungarian territory. He further suggested that this matter should best be negotiated directly by the Czech and Hungarian governments, and the peace conference should postpone discussions on the matter for the time being. Czech representative Clementis added that the desire to expand Bratislava also had security implications, and he denied Hungary's claim that Czechoslovakia intended to break into Hungarian territory as a result. On the contrary, Czechoslovakia's intention was to amend Czechoslovakia's original protruding border. Clementis said that he did not object to an investigation of the matter by a subcommittee. Finally, it was decided to establish a subcommittee composed of Australia, New Zealand, Ukraine, Canada, and Czechoslovakia to study the Czech request.

### US Refuses to Publish the Situation of Overseas Troops

[This Newspaper Report] Washington, 10th - The United States has flatly opposed the Soviet Union's request that all countries publish the strength and deployment of their troops stationed abroad (excluding former occupied areas).

### Foreign Minister Wang's Remarks Before Leaving France: Peace Should be Based on Justice. Peace Between Germany and Japan is Difficult to Expect Without Improving Relations Between the Great Powers. Our Internal Problems Should be Resolved Through Political Means.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 9th Special Dispatch] Our Foreign Minister Wang Shijie yesterday separately met with a reporter from the French semi-official newspaper Le Monde, saying that peace in the Far East depends greatly on the success of this peace conference. On the eve of his return to China, Foreign Minister Wang separately met with interviewers from the French newspaper Le Monde, the British London Times, and the American New York Times, and issued statements. Wang spoke a lot to the Le Monde interviewer, from his impression of France after liberation, his views on the Paris Peace Conference, to the Chinese Communist Party issue, and so on. Le Monde placed Wang's remarks on the front page of its newspaper today. Wang said in his remarks: If the five-nation treaty can be signed and established, then the relations between the great powers can be improved. If the politicians of the above-mentioned powers can understand at this moment how to benefit from this situation and can redouble their efforts to create sincere cooperation, then I can assert that it will not be too difficult to reach an agreement when dealing with the more important and more difficult issues of Germany and Japan in the future. Wang continued: Peace with Japan is easy, the issue of compensation is less complicated, and the issues of territory and others are the same, but Wang reiterated that peace with Germany and Japan cannot be achieved without an improvement in relations between the great powers, because without an atmosphere of mutual trust, everything is impossible. On the contrary, if this kind of good atmosphere is created, everything can become simple. When the Le Monde interviewer asked what China's attitude towards Japan after the defeat was, Wang replied: China does not believe in a policy of retaliation. China provides assistance to Japanese democrats and allows them to consolidate their positions. The interviewer then asked whether he was satisfied with the current US policy towards Japan. Wang replied: The policies of China and the United States towards Japan are generally the same.

Regarding his impression of France after liberation, Wang said: The speed of France's political and economic recovery is unexpected. He was very pleased that Paris and other major French cities were not damaged. When mentioning the Chinese Communist Party issue, he said that the central government's position is that China's internal problems can only be resolved through peaceful and political means. I personally believe in patience, because time can help solve the problem. Wang's topic shifted from the Dutch East Indies to the Vietnam issue, saying that he also hoped that the Dutch East Indies and the Vietnam issue could be resolved peacefully. Wang concluded: I firmly believe that France knows how to express its historical spirit of justice and freedom. Although the difficulties ahead are great, they are not impossible to overcome.

[French News Agency, Paris, 9th] Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Shijie recently issued a statement to a reporter from Le Monde, saying that peace in the Far East depends greatly on the success of the Paris Peace Conference. Looking at the main issues faced by the representatives of various countries in the Luxembourg Palace, it can be seen that peace cannot last if it is not based on justice. The so-called justice is that all countries, both small and defeated, should be treated fairly. If there are still hidden dangers in the defeated countries, then their military defeat is not enough to guarantee European security. I think the Paris Peace Conference has respected this principle. Although there have been heated debates at this conference, I think the solutions proposed by the four powers are generally good, but it is regrettable that the conference's discussion of the problem of Italy's former colonies has been decided to be postponed. The Chinese delegation suggested that the peace conference should immediately make Libya, Italy's former colony, independent. If this is not possible, it should be submitted to the United Nations for trusteeship for several years before declaring independence.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 10th] The famous afternoon newspaper Tokyo Shimbun today published Foreign Minister Wang Shijie's statement in Paris in a very prominent position, saying that China's demand for reparations from Japan will not exceed Japan's ability to pay. The small newspaper Minpo also published Wang's remarks in a prominent position.

### International Tribunal Exposes Japanese Conspiracy: Behind-the-Scenes Establishment of Puppet Regimes; Konoe's Broadcast Provides Clear Evidence of Warmongering

[Kaizo Sha, Tokyo, 10th] Prosecutors at the Far East International Tribunal today presented records held by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, revealing the behind-the-scenes work of Japan in establishing puppet regimes in China. According to the records, regarding North China, in the 26th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1937], the Japanese side conspired to induce Wang Kemin to form a puppet regime in North China. At that time, Wang was living in Hong Kong, and after being incited by Ki Tada, head of the special agency stationed in Peiping [Beijing], and Yamamoto Eiji, Wang finally decided to take on the position in the puppet regime, and the puppet Provisional Government was established on December 14th. Regarding Central China, the puppet Dadao Government was formed through the efforts of the puppet mayor Su Xiwén, Japanese army attaché Colonel Kusumoto, and staff headquarters Colonel Kagezuo. The puppet Shanghai War Zone Relief and Rehabilitation Committee, with Zhang Xiaolin's Green Gang forces as its background and with Yu Qiaqing and others as its center, attempted to establish a puppet regime, but failed. Kan’no Osato, Yamada Junzaburo, and others conspired to support Tang Shaoyi, and Ju Zheng and others of the Xishan faction to establish a puppet regime, but also failed. Secondly, Zhou Zuomin and other figures in the Shanghai financial community plotted to probe President Chiang's intentions towards Japan in order to make contact with the Japanese side, but it did not materialize. In addition, Xiong Bin was active in Shanghai, plotting to form the so-called "Jiangsu Public Security Maintenance Association" and conspiring to contact He Yingqin. Moreover, Kobe overseas Chinese from the Wang Jingwei faction also conspired to contact Japanese people in Shanghai. Later, Liang Hongzhi, Ren Yuandao, Chen Qun, Wen Zongyao, and others formed the puppet Reformed Government on March 28th of the 31st year [of the Republic, i.e., 1942].

[United Press, Tokyo, 10th] The Far East International Military Tribunal continued its trial of Japanese war criminals this morning. The prosecution presented numerous pieces of evidence proving how Japan carried out economic aggression in Manchuria and North China, and explained that Japan possessed almost superhuman power in intelligence and military affairs. According to the broadcast speech by former Japanese Prime Minister Konoe, which was presented by the prosecution, the Japanese domestic public absolutely trusted the soldiers on the front lines, silently engaged in wartime production, and prepared for a long-term war, at which time we could repeatedly demonstrate the inherent spirit of Japan. History shows us that the rise and fall of our national fortune depends on whether our entire nation can recognize the Japanese national polity. Konoe's speech also mentioned the fall of Guangzhou and Hankou, and stated, "From now on, the Chinese government will only be a local regime, and Japan has not exhausted its military strength, yet has already achieved this effect. This is due to the sacred virtue of His Majesty the Emperor, which makes us feel extremely moved."

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 9th] Zhu Shiming, head of our delegation to Japan, has cabled the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission suggesting that Gao Yuzhao (transliteration), a Taiwanese millionaire residing in Tokyo, be stripped of all titles and honors, because Mr. Gao is engaged in various illegal activities in Tokyo and has not stopped despite repeated warnings.

### British Communist Party Leads "Squatting" Movement: Cabinet Discusses Countermeasures

[United Press, London, 9th] The British Cabinet held a special meeting today to discuss strategies to deal with the Communist Party-led "squatting" movement. The aim of the squatters is to seize vacant houses, especially luxurious apartments, the rent of which is more than 10 pounds per week. Even as Prime Minister Attlee and his cabinet members were meeting, four houses were invaded in the Kingston area. Yesterday, 800 squatters occupied several luxurious apartment buildings in the Kingston area and two houses in the Feltham area, with 1,000 men, women, and children moving in during the 24 hours. This large-scale squatting movement is part of the Communist Party's new movement of "direct action." There are at least 250,000 households in London still looking for housing. According to those in charge, occupying private property is different from occupying public property, and the owners should legally evict the squatters.

### Successful Determination of a Large State-Run Enterprise: The Grassroots System of the United States (Part 1)

—Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing's Dispatch—

[Knoxville, Tennessee, August 15th] During my ten-day stay in Tennessee, I was most interested in two things: first, the great dam construction and its inexhaustible source of power; second, these noisy American children who felt an unparalleled freshness and interest in state-run enterprises. This is a miracle. From the founding of the United States to now, it is the first time that such a large-scale enterprise has been run by the state. When I was in New York and Chicago, I heard many American friends talk about it, half of whom were still dubious about the success or failure of the TVA. Many Americans slandered the TVA as the most foolish act in the world. They said: How can enterprises be run by the government? Politicians themselves do not understand "the way to create wealth!" On my first day in Knoxville, I directly asked Mr. Tingli, the deputy director of the information department, and he said: The slander of the TVA from the outside is not just one or two isolated opinions. "They have organized groups. You are a news reporter, so you naturally understand what propaganda is." He picked up a booklet and shook it, saying: "Enough to see, the power of propaganda is very great!" This small book is called "Dangerous TVA," written by a man named Edwin Vernate. Afterwards, I learned that Forgett was the "spokesman" for the Midwestern electric power company in the United States. Forgett wrote this book and has already become a multimillionaire in the United States. People in the TVA want to spit on the name of Forgett, but American capitalist trust giants are reading Forgett's book like the Bible, introducing and promoting it. Henry sent me a TVA mimeograph, a full twenty pages and thousands of words of "Rebuttal," which was only published in April of this year and was the TVA's first rebuttal to external insults. It began by saying: In the United States, there is a force that is attacking the TVA's state-run enterprises. They fabricate rumors and slander out of thin air to promote the failure and collapse of the TVA. He also listed the members of this opposing force, including: Edison Electric Company, National Electric Power Company Federation, US Chamber of Commerce, Water Power Committee, Federation of 31 Water Companies, and many other agencies with conflicting interests. In addition to commercial agencies jointly opposing the TVA, the rebuttal also listed an article in Harper's Magazine, written by Clayton, an editor of Harper's Magazine and a social economist. After examining the TVA, Clayton believed that this state-run enterprise would fail. He looked at it from an economic point of view and listed many figures, saying that the TVA's management methods were unreasonable, saying: "The power company bosses must be clapping and cheering after seeing my critical article, but I declare: I am not writing it for their applause, I am simply discussing the matter as it is." The rebuttal, from the current financial situation, management methods, and preparations for repaying principal and interest, was written in detail, stating that the TVA's management was not only beneficial but also benefited the people. I do not intend to copy these figures, because I think that more worthy of our attention than repaying principal and interest is the management and organization of state-run enterprises. Since its establishment in 1933, the TVA has undergone one change after another in its organization. Even now, senior TVA officials dare not say that their current system is a perfect and ideal system. However, because of the TVA's continuous improvement and experimentation, Americans have begun to understand what state-run enterprises are all about. At the same time, the TVA's own repeated attempts and improvements have promoted the growth of its business. In Tennessee, you can hear the word "grassroots" everywhere. The meaning of grassroots is not the so-called "bark and roots" in Chinese dictionaries, but a symbol of the form of an organizational structure. The roots penetrate deep into the soil, develop around, and leave a root system that is independent and unconnected. This is the organizational spirit of the TVA. For thirteen years, the TVA has grown from a very small unit to its current scale, thanks to the organizational principle of the so-called "grassroots system." Who started using the word "grassroots?" I cannot investigate. However, I know that the current chairman of the TVA, Mr. Li Lingsu, is a proponent of the grassroots system. Before Li Lingsu Han served as a director of the TVA, he advocated a system of political decentralization. He opposed the federal government's system of centralization of power in the United States. He said: If the administrative efficiency of the United States is to be enhanced, it must realize "democratic politics of the grassroots system." Last year, Li Lingsu wrote a book called "Democracy on the March—TVA." In addition to describing the construction of the TVA, this book particularly emphasizes the economic democracy of the United States, that is, the national socialization of the economy. He said a lot about administrative management and administrative efficiency, and explained a lot about the principles of the grassroots system. I talked about the "grassroots system" with many friends of the TVA. I feel that the concept of the grassroots system is very similar to China's system of tiered responsibility. For example, under the TVA, there is now a very large section called the "Power Department." When it was first established, the unit managing electricity was very small and was originally attached to the board of directors. Later, as the dams were completed one after another, electricity became the main part of the TVA. Due to needs, it gradually expanded and developed to become the large organization that the Power Department is today. The director of the Power Department is the dictator of all power-related matters of the TVA. The director is responsible to the general manager, and the general manager is responsible to the chairman, but the director of the Power Department does not need to "request instructions," "submit judgments," or "authorize" for matters related to electricity. For example, under the Power Department, there are now three sections: the Power Utilization Section, the Power Management Section, and the Engineering Construction Section. The section chief has full authority to handle matters within the scope of one section. The section chief has the right to send documents externally. Sometimes, a section chief's phone call, without any official documents at all, does not require the section chief to review and authorize it. The result of tiered responsibility is that responsibility is clear, each other cannot shirk responsibility, administrative efficiency is fast, and business development is easy.

### Second Day of the City Council General Assembly: Councilors Raise More Than 100 Questions; List of Ten Review Committees Approved; Listening to Reports from the Land Administration and Finance Bureaus Today

[This Newspaper] Yesterday morning was the third meeting of the first general assembly of the City Council, with 151 councilors in attendance. In the morning, Police Chief Xuan Tiewu reported for one hour and ten minutes. After a ten-minute break, councilors raised a total of 84 inquiries, which was not economically viable due to reading each item aloud. Zhan Wenhú temporarily moved that it was not necessary to read the questions aloud, and the questions could be submitted to the responsible officials for consideration. Except for those requiring oral answers, the rest would be answered in writing. The motion was passed by the assembly. While Director Xuan was reviewing the inquiries, Mayor Wu first answered all the questions from the previous day.

It was also resolved by the assembly that future answers to inquiries would be held after the afternoon report in the morning, and after the morning report in the afternoon. Before adjourning at 11:45, Speaker Pan reported on the list of small group review committees (a total of ten groups). Any special proposals not belonging to any group would be reviewed by the first group. The secretariat would appoint one secretary to each group to take minutes.

Regarding the administrative reports of the bureau chiefs, councilors expressed that they took up too much time, affecting inquiries and answers. It was resolved that when the bureau chiefs reported, the oral supplementary report should be limited to one hour in addition to the written report. Therefore, at the fourth meeting in the afternoon, Health Bureau Chief Zhang Wei reported that since the actual work overview had been published in writing, only two additional points were supplemented. A total of 68 written inquiries related to health were received, which will be answered after the report from the Land Administration Bureau Chief this morning. Director Xuan then answered inquiries, and any that could not be answered orally would be answered in writing.

Councilors Tao Baichuan, Qu Yuè, Zhan Wenhu, and Lu Shidao expressed different opinions on the issue of the letter from the Suzhou-Zhejiang-Anhui Region Receiving Work Investigation Team requesting the dispatch of one city councilor to participate in the investigation, and it was decided to leave it for discussion today.

Today's agenda includes: the fifth meeting in the morning will be a report from Land Administration Bureau Chief Zhu Ping, and the Health Bureau Chief answering questions. The sixth meeting in the afternoon will be a report from Finance Bureau Chief Gu Chunfan, and Director Zhu answering questions, with time for discussions and reports in between.

### Police Chief Xuan Tiewu's Administrative Report: Three Principles, Eight Sections, Five Key Points

Police Chief Xuan Tiewu's report on the work of the Municipal Police Bureau from September 1945 to August 1946 stated: From the beginning of our takeover, the Bureau has been based on the duties of consolidating security, maintaining order, improving customs, and implementing administrative orders, in order to eliminate chaos, transform the environment, and lay the foundation for a new administration. Based on the national policy guidelines and the actual needs of the locality, the following three policy principles were formulated: 1. Strengthen police force, enrich equipment, eliminate bandits, and stabilize social order. 2. Prohibit opium and gambling, ban private prostitution, eradicate bad habits, and create a good atmosphere. 3. Improve the quality of the police, strengthen the training of new police, and promote remedial education in order to fulfill their responsibilities.

The Police Bureau, in accordance with the above policy principles, formulated core tasks. The implementation overview is divided into eight sections: security, social customs, fire prevention, opium prohibition, traffic, city appearance, organization and training, and personnel, which are summarized as follows:

Security: 1. Deploy police force, establish police stations, increase water sub-bureaus and substations, and use the two security police corps, patrol teams, and riding training teams in coordination. 2.

Manage dance halls, register dancers, review qualifications, and issue business licenses. 3. Ban morning dances. 4. Ban illegal and pornographic publications.

Fire Prevention: Fire prevention is extremely important in municipal administration, directly affecting the safety of citizens' lives and property. 1. Fire prevention is more important than fire rescue, so fire prevention is intensified. 2.

Finally, Director Xuan briefly reported on the points to be discussed by the Interim Council, divided into five points: administrative part, criminal part, fire prevention part, personnel part, and the implementation of the police officer system.

After the report was completed, Speaker Pan announced a ten-minute break.

### Seeking Welfare for Female Workers: Tang Guifen's Proposal

[This Newspaper] Tang Guifen, a current female staff member in the finishing department of the Tongyi Yarn Factory, told reporters yesterday: Female workers in the city's cotton spinning and weaving industry account for about 80% of the total number of workers. Among them, half have children and need to bear the burden of family life. Most female workers hope that the community will open childcare centers for workers, but because it is not easy to organize on a large scale, they request that they be established in factories or various units. Ms. Tang mentioned this point in her written proposal to this conference and requested that working hours be reduced to ten hours. This is the minimum requirement. If possible, the general female workers deeply hope that working hours can be reduced to eight hours, and the extra time can be used for schooling.

### City Government Bureaus' Expenditure Usage: Assembly Demands Detailed Reports

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Municipal Government's general budget for revenue and expenditure for the second half of the 35th year of the Republic has already been distributed to the city councilors yesterday afternoon by the municipal government for research and review. Before the adjournment, Councilor He Chengfu proposed a temporary motion requesting each bureau of the municipal government to provide detailed reports on financial expenditures and their usage for review purposes. Speaker Pan immediately agreed to submit this motion to all bureaus of the municipal government, requesting each bureau to submit expenditure reports to the Ninth Group for review by the Municipal Budget and Final Accounts Committee. Bureaus that have already presented their reports are still required to submit supplementary reports on this matter.

Councilor Wang Wei expressed to reporters that, regarding necessary business expenses, he hopes the municipal government will not reduce or eliminate them due to insufficient income. Instead, new taxes should be levied to provide additional funding.

### Four Major Airfields' Occupied Land Will Not Be Returned: To Be Requisitioned According to Law

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Jiangwan, Hongqiao, Longhua, and Dachang airfields in this city were occupied by the enemy and puppet regimes during the occupation period, and a large amount of surrounding civilian land was forcibly seized. According to Article 5 of the "Measures for Clearing Land Rights in Recovered Areas": "Privately owned land confiscated or forcibly occupied by enemy and puppet organizations shall be returned to the owners upon presentation of ownership certificates. If there are circumstances under Article 208 or 209 of the Land Law, it may be requisitioned according to law." Article 208 of the Land Law stipulates that the state may requisition privately owned land for public works (national defense, transportation, public utilities, water conservancy, etc.). Article 209 of the Land Law stipulates that the government may requisition privately owned land for the implementation of national economic policies.

Regarding the aforementioned occupied civilian land, the Municipal Land Administration Bureau, after Director Zhu took office, immediately submitted a request to the municipal government to forward it to the Air Force's important bases. Longhua has been designated as a civil aviation airfield, so the occupied land cannot be returned. The municipal government should complete the requisition procedures in accordance with the law. These procedures include surveying, investigating land registration, public announcements, and valuation. The Air Force Commission has agreed to bear the surveying costs for the Hongqiao and Longhua airfields, and the budget for this was submitted by the Land Administration Bureau to the municipal government and forwarded to the Air Force authorities in July of this year. Work will begin as soon as the funds are allocated. The bureau is currently in contact with the Air Force authorities regarding the other airfields.

### Reading Reports Like Giving a Lecture: Economic Time, Back to the Point

When Director Xuan Tiewu presented his report yesterday, he read verbatim from the printed written report. Some councilors were reading newspapers, some were writing, and some said it was very much like attending a lecture.

When Director Zhang Wei of the Health Bureau presented his report, he cited extensively from various sources. The councilors probably thought he was "too far off topic." Zhao Yangyun, considering the economic time, said, "Director Zhang, please get back to the point."

There were more than ten large statistical charts hung on the walls of the meeting hall by the Police Bureau and the Health Bureau.

During the morning session, as Mayor Wu was responding to the questions raised by the councilors the day before, it was pouring rain outside. When the mayor was responding to the "chaos" issue raised by Tao Baichuan, there was a sudden clap of thunder that startled everyone. Later, when explaining the cost of living index, there were two more consecutive thunderclaps.

Tao Baichuan's seat was the last one in the hall, number 175, but he often made shocking remarks when he spoke.

Director Xuan said in his report: "Waitresses, what Shanghai people call 'glass cups', are the most harmful things to public morals."

Director Xuan also said: "Once, at a fire, the fire brigade arrived but could not start rescue operations immediately because there was no water in the hydrants. There were rumors that they demanded 40 million [currency not specified], but I can guarantee that there was no such thing."

Councilwoman Tian Shujun, originally seat number 159, moved to seat number 166 in the back yesterday afternoon to accompany Councilwoman Tong Daoyun. But at 4:20 PM, Tong Xiang took seat 166 as a non-voting attendee, and Ms. Tian had to give up her seat and "return to her original seat." After returning to her seat, she exchanged teacups. Councilor Pang Jingzhou, after Director Zhang Wei of the Health Bureau reported on his administration yesterday afternoon, buried himself in his work, putting his glasses on his forehead, looking very nervous, probably writing some inquiry draft.

### Snippets from the Meeting

Mayor Wu's attitude was calm, concise, and to the point when answering various inquiries yesterday, which was admirable. When the mayor answered Zhang Xuelian's question, "Can the mayor be more accessible to the public? The mayor's proximity to the district chiefs is tantamount to being in constant contact with the public." The mayor said: I think that statement is "absolutely correct."

In the Yiyuan meeting hall, there was a cup of plain tea in the morning on both the previous day and yesterday, but yesterday afternoon it was suddenly replaced with a cup of regular black tea.

Director Zhang Wei of the Health Bureau attended the report, accompanied by the chief secretary and four department heads, to be prepared to answer the inquiries of the councilors.

### "Glass Cups" Carry Heavy Sins: Thunderstorms Startle Everyone

A few minutes before the adjournment of the third general assembly, Councilor Lu Enze fired a shot, questioning the mayor as to why he pushed away the grain loan case so cleanly. At the adjournment, Mayor Wu rushed to Councilor Lu's seat to explain that the grain loan case was indeed not related to the municipal government, and all the case files were not in the municipal government, so there was no way to report on the facts of the grain loan case.

A certain councilor used his social skills to distribute cards and invitations to some reporters.

### Mayor's Oral Responses to Inquiries: Shared Opinion on the Situation of "Chaos": Urban Plan to Be Completed Next Year

The mayor's oral responses to the inquiries of the councilors the day before can be summarized as follows: (1) Hawker problem: Those who are being suppressed are hawkers with significant capital, because they obstruct legitimate commerce and are outlets for stolen goods from the docks. However, small food stalls and cigarette stands set up by poor people will not be suppressed for the time being. As for the method of centralized operation, the first thing to consider is whether the source of the goods is legitimate, and the second is whether they can pay taxes in accordance with the business tax law. (2) Housing problem: The Housing Allocation Committee has taken over more than 6,000 buildings in the Hongkou district, and a detailed list will be announced in mid-September. After the municipal government takes over, it will strictly implement the allocation process. In addition to negotiating with their superior agencies regarding the situation of certain agencies forcibly occupying houses, it also hopes to impose sanctions. On the one hand, it will encourage construction in the hope of fundamentally solving the problem. (3) Food problem: There have been rumors in the city again in the past few days, and it is hoped that everyone will not believe them lightly. Rice prices did not rise the day before yesterday, and the South Market even fell by about 4,000 yuan. Taiwan rice and other rice can be transported in, and the new year's grain can also be launched at the end of September. In the future, if rice prices are unstable, the rationing system will still be adopted.

(4) Labor-management issues will be handled in accordance with central laws and regulations. The recent barbershop dispute, after arbitration, has not shown any changes in fact. (5) The He Dehui case was reported to the central government by the Political Participation Council. The Ministry of Judicial Administration has sent personnel to Shanghai to investigate, and it will be fully announced soon. (6) The grain loan case is not within the scope of the municipal government's authority and is inconvenient to answer. (7) Regarding the municipal government itself: First, the Industrial and Trust Company was established during the tenure of the previous mayor. The original work was municipal ferry and land requisition and sale in the central area of ​​the city. The current work is building affordable housing villages. Second, there will be measures to deal with those who served in puppet organizations recently promulgated by the central government, which will be handled accordingly. Third, the handling fee for the Property Management Office of the Occupied Territories was determined during the term of the previous mayor to compensate for the costs of point checking and moving. The original amount was 3 million yuan, which has now been reduced to 1 million yuan or 2 million yuan. The accounts will be disclosed. Fourth, the cost-of-living index is calculated based on major items such as rice and cloth and is a statistical issue. As for shortening the publication period, it is feared that it will stimulate public sentiment and is not intended to be implemented. (8) Regarding the situation of "chaos," I also agree and am trying my best to seek order and stability from chaos, hoping to cooperate with the councilors. (9) The property of the former concession is now handled by the Liquidation Committee, but there have been slight changes in the organization recently. (10) Strict suppression of unauthorized construction of shantytowns, while encouraging legal construction. (11) Strict suppression of theft at the docks, and the Port Committee will be established soon. (12) It is hoped that the entire urban plan will be completed before the third council meeting next year.

### Should We Participate in the Investigation Team? Councilors Have Different Opinions: Tao Baichuan Thinks the Investigation Team Is Ineffective: First Ask How Many Days of Life Are Left?

The most exciting scene of yesterday's conference was near the adjournment in the afternoon. The clock had pointed to 5:30. Before announcing the adjournment, the Speaker said that there was something to report. He read the letter from the Su, Zhejiang, and Anhui District Receiving Materials Investigation Team. The content was to invite the Municipal Council to select a councilor to participate in their investigation work.

The Speaker asked everyone how to select this councilor to participate in the investigation work. At that time, some advocated using a ballot, and everyone did not seem to consider whether it was "possible" to accept the request of the investigation team. However, suddenly, Tao Baichuan stood up in an unexpected posture and expressed his explosive opinion.

He said: "Regarding the establishment of the Receiving Materials Investigation Team, I once opposed it when I participated in the Political Participation Council as a councilor, because I thought that the investigation team would never have any effect, but my opinion was not adopted. Now, from the facts, the investigation team has indeed not had any effect. In the future, when it writes its report, it will say that the receiving situation is very good, and it will be worthwhile to bear legal responsibility for others for nothing. Moreover, the investigation team is about to end soon and will return to Nanjing from Hangzhou soon. We are even less worthy of sending someone to participate at this time and bear legal responsibility for those who have made a fortune from the victory!"

Before he finished speaking, he received warm applause from the audience. When the Speaker asked if anyone seconded his opinion, the councilors raised their hands one after another, and their expressions were very excited. It seemed that Tao Baichuan's opinion could be passed. However, unexpectedly, Qu Yue, who wore glasses and looked somewhat like an old scholar, stood up.

He said that he opposed Tao's opinion and that this opinion was the style of irresponsible old-style bureaucrats. He said that it was precisely because we knew that there were problems with receiving enemy and puppet materials, and precisely because the work of the investigation team had no results, that we should send someone to participate and see what was going on!

Qu Yue's words also made sense, and the councilors' emotions were obviously disordered. There were also people who seconded him. At this time, Zhan Wenhuan stood up and added:

Zhan said: "It is a fact that the receiving situation is not satisfactory. The investigation team is relatively unfamiliar with some things. To conduct a serious investigation, there must be people who really understand the inside story. Therefore, I advocate that we should either not accept the invitation of the investigation team, or if we accept it, it is not enough to send one person to go. We want to send five to seven people to go and seriously investigate."

Lu Shidao's opinion went even further. He said: "We should either not be involved in the receiving matter, or if we investigate, we must find out the result. However, the investigation team's method is stipulated by the central government. If we send someone to go, we will still be subject to restrictions. If they want to go east, we go east, and if they want to go west, we go west. We will definitely not get any results in the old way. Therefore, I advocate that if we want to investigate, we should submit a request to the government to let our council investigate ourselves."

It was already 5:45. The Speaker announced that there are now four different opinions. Due to time constraints, it will be put to a vote tomorrow morning. Before the adjournment, Tao Baichuan added one point. He asked Speaker Pan to ask the investigation team two questions before putting this issue to a vote tomorrow: First, how much life does the investigation team have left? Second, is the nature of the investigation team's invitation to the council to send someone to participate only in an assistant position?

### To Compete With the World, We Still Need to Work Hard for Twenty Years: Zhang Wei Reports on Health: Believes That Eliminating Corruption Requires First Fostering Integrity

The fourth meeting continued at 3:00 PM. Councilor Hou Yuan proposed to cancel the oral reports of each bureau director to save time. However, Jiang Huaisu stood up and said that oral reports are still needed, but it is not necessary to read the written report verbatim, but to supplement the shortcomings of the written report. Speaker Pan then issued a statement that this matter is related to the agenda of the General Assembly, and each bureau director has been notified to attend the report, so the oral report should still be available, but it must supplement the shortcomings of the written report and must not exceed one hour.

Then, Director Zhang Wei of the Health Bureau reported. Director Zhang said that Shanghai has a population of more than 4 million, and health work is extremely heavy. During the 80 days of taking office, he has not only failed to make any achievements, but has not even become familiar with the doorway. Most of the time has been spent searching for the source of the disease and dealing with temporary problems. The fundamental solution is only now being carried out. Although everyone is working harder, there are still not many achievements due to a lack of conditions. The city treasury is empty, and the situation is difficult.

At present, striving for material funding, technology and time is extremely urgent, and psychological construction is even more important. Greed, exploitation, deception, fraud, decadence, decline, extravagance, and licentiousness are all bad habits that can hinder the progress of work.

Of course, this also has its external reasons, that is, the treatment is meager and insufficient to maintain life. May I ask, how can a cleaner live on a monthly income of more than 90,000 yuan? For example, the salary of a nurse in our bureau is only 200,000 yuan per month, while a special nurse can earn 50,000 yuan per day. Therefore, if we want to eliminate corruption and have a clean atmosphere, we must increase treatment so that we can foster integrity.

Let us think, why were there fewer corrupt things before the war? Why do we know about these malpractices, but not disclose them? Or use appropriate methods to make illegal activities legal?

The urgent task is to vigorously carry out psychological construction, and then strive for material conditions. Twenty years later, we will surely be able to compete with other major cities in the world?

What I am talking about today is not a work report, but a statement of attitude. Please, councilors, make some corrections. To eliminate corruption, we must stabilize life. To do things, we must first have tools, so we must have money and have enough time to complete the work. Director Zhang finished in a hurry, and Director Xuan answered questions.

As for the Health Bureau's written work report, it includes: Adjusting, implementing cadres; uniting forces, facilities. Borrowing tools, improving street cleaning and other ten items. And record the relevant work digits.

### Playing Mahjong with Four People Is Not Considered Gambling: Dog Racing and Horse Racing Are All Prohibited: The Extortion of Misconduct by Unscrupulous Police Officers Has Not Been Eradicated: Director Xuan's Oral Response to Councilor Inquiries

The councilors submitted a total of 84 written questions to the Police Bureau, and Director Xuan answered them orally one by one. There was a ten-minute break in the middle. Finally, due to lack of time, some items were changed to written replies. The main contents of yesterday's reply are as follows: (1) Drug use and drug trafficking cases are being severely arrested, and it is hoped that the people will report and assist. There are currently more than 6,000 drug addicts, but only a few hundred have been rehabilitated, which is due to the small scale of the rehabilitation center. It is now planned to request the municipal government to allocate funds to add more facilities and cooperate with the Health Bureau, hoping to eliminate them within two years.

(2) The extortion of misconduct by unscrupulous police officers has not been eradicated, and this trend must be rectified. It is also hoped that the people will report. (3) In terms of traffic, there are currently 888 traffic police officers. Depending on the situation of each intersection, one to six people are placed. However, the fundamental difficulty is still the narrowness of the roads, the excessive number of vehicles, and the fact that most do not follow the rules. As for the installation of automatic traffic lights, there is currently no financial capacity for this. (4) Regarding the prostitution problem, we can only start with public prostitutes first, ordering them to register and be inspected before issuing licenses. As for private prostitutes, of course, they will still be strictly prohibited. (5) Regarding the suppression of gambling, some places have broken through the face and enforced it, but the civil law stipulates that playing mahjong with four people is not considered gambling, so unless the law is amended, it cannot be enforced. Other activities such as jai alai, dog racing, and horse racing are also being suppressed. (6) The recently implemented method of managing second-hand stores is very helpful in cracking theft cases. (7) Regarding the police bureau's staffing, the number of police officers has not yet reached the quota. There are only more than 5,000 real criminal police officers. Some people say that there are too many police bureau staff. In fact, it is not that there are too many staff, but that there are too few police officers. It is hoped that they will be gradually supplemented within three years. (8) There is a detailed inventory of the property and materials received from the puppet police bureau. There are a total of more than 9,700 guns inside. (10) The police bureau runs its own children's school. Some people questioned it as a manifestation of feudal thought. In fact, because there are not enough schools in the city, and at the same time to reduce the burden on police officers, it is actually promoting education.

Yiyuan Operates as Usual at Night

[Our Newspaper's Report] The venue for this session of the Municipal Council is the Yiyuan Hotel on Fuxing Middle Road. The hotel, in view of the fact that the Council is a public opinion organization, generously leases it out for a fee of only 250,000 yuan per day. Apart from the meeting time, it still operates as usual from 7:00 PM every day. Yesterday was the Mid-Autumn Festival, and there were also spectacular fireworks starting at 10:30 PM.

Ye Gongchao Leaves Shanghai for Beijing

[Our Newspaper's Report] Ye Gongchao, counselor of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, had previously come to Shanghai for a short stay. It is now known that he left Shanghai for Beijing yesterday morning. Ye was formerly a professor at Tsinghua and Peking Universities and is a well-known literary critic in the country. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he served as China's representative in the UK for the Ministry of Propaganda, working hard for the country and being highly admired by the British. During the occupation of Shanghai, Ye was framed by traitors and arrested by the enemy's military police. He later secretly left Shanghai and went to Hong Kong and then to the UK. This is his first visit to Shanghai since the war.

### Heavy Losses for British Tram Company: Many Plans Difficult to Implement for the Time Being

[Our Newspaper's Report] The congestion in this city's traffic and the lack of public vehicles are the main causes. The reporter recently learned from the British Tram Company that the company's trams were severely damaged during the enemy and puppet period, so the number of trams running is less than before the war. Routes 6 and [unclear] Road are difficult to restore because a part of the tracks has been dismantled. Other vehicles have not been replaced with rubber tires for eight years due to years of disrepair and the war, resulting in a large number of trolleybuses on Routes 18 and 20 being stopped in the station. Only a few trolleybuses on Route 17 are responding to the market, and the proposal to operate jointly with the French company has been shelved because the vehicles are difficult to match. It is heard that the company has pre-ordered rubber tires from England, which can arrive in three batches. The first batch can be transported this month. After assembly, the closed routes can be restored ahead of schedule. As for the connection between the north and south tracks of Xizang Road and Jing'an Temple Road, it needs to be carried out after the road is widened. It is feared that it will be difficult to achieve this year.

### New Traffic Measures: Difficulties Are Inevitable at the Beginning of Implementation: Public Works Bureau Emergency Meeting: More Traffic Police to Be Added

[Our Newspaper's Report] The central area of ​​the city is too congested due to the excessive number of vehicles. Therefore, even after the implementation of traffic improvement measures, the vehicles are still extremely congested. Moreover, because the new measures were implemented at the beginning, many drivers were unable to understand them thoroughly, and there were many violations. According to the police bureau's statistics yesterday, the fines for vehicle violations in one day yesterday reached 3 million yuan, and the traffic police felt that it was difficult to direct traffic. The disorder on the road has not been completely improved. Therefore, Zhao Zengjue, director of the Public Works Bureau, convened an emergency meeting on traffic improvement in the municipal government conference room at 3:00 PM yesterday to discuss effective measures. It is heard that there will be no changes in principle to the measures that have already been implemented, such as one-way traffic lanes and parking lots, which will remain the same. However, more traffic police will be added to achieve practical results.

### The United Nations' Largest Transport Ship: Carrying Wheat Seeds from South America

[Reported by this newspaper] The Sieur De Lasalle, the largest transport ship of the United Nations, arrived here yesterday from Argentina, carrying 8,500 tons of South American wheat seeds, after completing its 12,000-mile long voyage.

### Why Was a Female Performer Splashed with Excrement? Yuan Xuefen Appeals for Justice

Yue opera actress Yuan Xuefen received the press at the Atlantic Restaurant at 10:00 AM yesterday. First, Ms. Yuan reported on the improvements made to Yue opera. She also explained the incident on the 28th of last month when she was splashed with a package of excrement, stating that although she clearly knew who was responsible, she had no definite proof and could not identify the culprit. After the incident, she was repeatedly threatened. Therefore, in addition to filing a report with the police authorities, she requested that society and the press uphold justice. As for refusing to join the labor union, it was truly due to poor health and being busy with performances, she said. On the left is the actress Yuan Xuefen (photographed by this newspaper)

### Military Uniform Factory Receives a Holiday Gift: Actually a Large Bomb

[Reported by this newspaper] Yan Wenqing, the manager of the Facheng Military Uniform Factory on North Jiangxi Road, recently received a threatening letter under the name of "Chen Lifa," attempting to extort two million US dollars, otherwise, there would be unfavorable consequences, etc. The factory dismissed it with a laugh. Who knew that the night before last, someone resembling a worker, holding a round object wrapped in a package, falsely claimed to be delivering a "holiday gift" and handed it to the factory's office worker before leaving. After unwrapping the package, it turned out to be a huge bomb. Fortunately, it did not explode. They immediately reported the information to the police station and requested an investigation.

### Increasing Yarn Factory Production by Utilizing Nighttime Electricity

The electrical companies in this city, whose equipment before the war was mostly destroyed during the occupation, have limited power generation capacity, resulting in supply not meeting demand, which greatly impacts industrial production. Considering the increasing need for electricity in various industries, especially the yarn factories, which are related to daily necessities and are even more important, the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities has repeatedly urged the Shanghai Power Company to find ways to adjust the load so that all machinery can be fully utilized. It is reported that starting today, during the nighttime (from 11:00 PM to 7:00 AM the next morning) and every Sunday, an additional 15,000 kilowatts of electricity will be available to meet the needs of yarn factories for increasing production. It is also reported that various yarn factories have begun to fully utilize this electricity starting today. Based on the yarn factories' electricity consumption of 19 million kilowatt-hours last month, this month's consumption will exceed 20 million kilowatt-hours.

### Chongqing Takes Over Labor Association Incident: Two Organizations Accuse Each Other

[Reported by this newspaper] Wu Zhiheng, a representative of the Chongqing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, hosted the local press at the Kangle Restaurant at 2:00 PM yesterday to announce the process of the Chongqing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions taking over and sealing up the Chongqing office and various welfare institutions of the Chinese Association of Labor Service Corps (CALSC) over a month ago. Wu reported that the reasons for the "takeover" were mainly: (1) Randomly using American donation funds for private gain and engaging in corruption. (2) Using workers to incite labor unrest. (3) Endangering public security and plotting against the government. That evening, the CALSC headquarters issued a statement, claiming that Wu Zhiheng's remarks distorted the facts and maliciously slandered the association, and refuted them in five points.

Furthermore, it is reported that Zhu Xuefan, the chairman of the Chinese Association of Labor, went to Gu (Lushan) on the 7th of this month in response to a telegram from Chairman Chiang. It is now known that the Chairman summoned Zhu on the 10th. Zhu is scheduled to fly back to Shanghai at 6:00 PM tomorrow.

### Public School Employees' Rationed Goods: Payment and Purchase to Begin Tomorrow

The Shanghai Public School Employees' Rationed Goods Distribution Office's first distribution was originally scheduled to begin today. However, as there are over 1,000 institutions and organizations in this city, the office has received over 120,000 ration coupons from various parties. The work of reviewing and numbering them is extremely complicated, so it has been decided to postpone the distribution until tomorrow. The distribution method will be that the office will issue payment notices for the rationed goods, stamped with the seal of the institution or organization, to purchase the corresponding amount. The payment notice needs to be filled out with the name of the institution, the name of the person receiving the goods, the name of the person in charge, the payment date, the amount, and other information.

### The High Court Continues to Hear the Case of Yan Chuntang and Summons Several Witnesses for Questioning; The Cases of the Lin Qin Brothers and Mei Jicheng are Concluded

[Reported by this newspaper] Yan Chuntang, the former manager of Yihua Film Company, was arrested after the outbreak of the Pacific War when enemy and puppet forces occupied the Shanghai concessions, because he had served as a supervisor in the puppet Chinese Film United Company. The High Procuratorate filed a public lawsuit against him on charges of treason, and the High Court has already held one hearing. At the second hearing yesterday afternoon, Yan stated: Yihua Company was founded in 1927 and was a shareholder-based company, not a sole proprietorship. It had produced many films over the past ten years. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, it was difficult to maintain due to a shortage of raw materials. In June of the following year, Zhang Shankun came and said that the Shanghai Film Company would be merged. He persuaded me to join, so I sold it to the puppet Chinese United Film Production Company for 200,000 yuan, but I only received 125,000 yuan in cash. Later, the company merged with "China Film Company" and "Shanghai Cinema Company" to reorganize into the puppet Chinese Film United Company, and hired me as a supervisor in name, but I resigned without taking the position. At the end of June of the thirty-second year (1943), I personally bought back the Yihua company that I had sold, he said. The court then questioned Yuan Yijiang, the director of the Shanghai Liaison Office of the former Military Intelligence Bureau's Shanghai Suburban Command Station, and Chen Boliang, the captain of the Workers' Commando Team's West Shanghai District, regarding the defendant's claim that he had sheltered underground workers and secret radio stations and was arrested and tortured by the enemy's military police. It also summoned Feng Jie, the general manager of the puppet Chinese Film United Company, and Huang Tianzu, the production minister, to inquire about the defendant's participation in "Huaying." The case was adjourned for further hearing, and the defendant was remanded in custody.

Furthermore, the cases of Wang Wei, a secret agent of the enemy's military police, and his mistress Fan Jingfang, who framed our underground workers, the White Russian intelligence agent Taitiesiji who sabotaged our anti-Japanese work, and the suspected traitors Zhang Genshou and Sun Xiaolin, were all investigated and adjourned for further hearing.

[Furthermore, it is reported] The three Lin brothers, Lin Qin, Lin Ji, and Lin Mai, were accused of organizing the Dingji Company during the enemy and puppet period, buying rice, cotton, and other supplies for the enemy and selling Japanese goods. The case was concluded by the High Court yesterday, and the verdict will be announced on the 17th of this month. The case of the puppet Baozhang (neighborhood chief) Mei Jicheng will also be announced on the 17th.

### Former Headquarters of the Fourth Provincial Border Region Holds Garden Party

During the Anti-Japanese War, the central government designated the border region of Lu (Shandong), Su (Jiangsu), Wan (Anhui), and Yu (Henan) as a party-government reconstruction zone, and appointed General Tang Enbo as the commander-in-chief of the border region and the chairman of the border region party-government branch. Due to the integration of party, government, and military, the achievements were remarkable, making it the best of all the party-government branches in the country. After the victory, General Tang flew to Shanghai to preside over the surrender matters in Nanjing and Shanghai, and his former subordinates also came to serve in the Nanjing and Shanghai area. However, due to busy work, there have been no opportunities for cheerful gatherings in recent years. Now, on the occasion of the anniversary of the victory and return, Zhang Yulin, Hu Jingru, Wei Luqi, Wang Mingbin, Weng Wenqing, Lu Shishang, and others initiated a Mid-Autumn Festival garden party at Zhou's Garden on Haige Road yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM.

The authorities learned that Sun was hiding in Shanghai, so they ordered the garrison command to arrest him and bring him back. It is now known that Sun was wandering near Fuxu Road in this city yesterday when he was about to board a car. Officers from the Inspection Office of the Garrison Command stepped forward to arrest him and took him to the headquarters for interrogation.

### Mo Guangcheng's Words About the Zhang Xinfu Case

— Special Correspondent Lingfeng from Shenyang Airmail on August 27th, This Newspaper

Bloodstains in the History of Takeovers

Zhang Xinfu's blood has stained the opening page of the history of the Northeast takeover.

It was in the early days of the Northeast restoration, in early January, when it was "icy and snowy" and "the wind was biting," a special train carrying the central government's industrial and mining takeover personnel to the Northeast, whistling as it headed towards Fushun, preparing to take over the Fushun coal mines.

At that time, Fushun and the railway line from Shenyang to Fushun were mostly controlled by the Communist army. Sitting on the special train were Mr. Zhang Xinfu, as well as other industrial and mining takeover personnel accompanying Mr. Zhang to Fushun. In addition, there were some railway police, who had previously obtained safety guarantees from the Soviet army.

This special train managed to reach Fushun, but because the situation was not right, Zhang and others requested that the special train return to Shenyang. When the train reached Lishizhai station halfway, a tragedy occurred. Zhang Xinfu and his eight companions were stabbed in the chest by the Communist army. Zhang had eighteen stab wounds on his body, and the other personnel suffered the same fate. The bodies of Zhang Xinfu and the other martyrs were left on the snow for several days, for the villagers nearby to view. The guarding Communist army told the villagers, "He is a major traitor, does he deserve to die?" Everyone had to say, "He deserves to die," before leaving. The residents of the Lishizhai area still often tell of the tragic scene at that time.

Eight months have passed, and Zhang Xinfu and others have died with resentment, their grievances unavenged, their coffins parked in the Guandi Temple in Shenyang. Today, the Communist army "Company Commander of the 7th Company, 3rd Battalion, 22nd Regiment, 8th Brigade of the Liaodong Military Region" Mo Guangcheng, who carried out the execution at that time, has finally been captured. After military trials in Jinzhou and Shenyang, Mo confessed frankly and without hesitation. However, he added that he was executing orders from the Communist army authorities, and that he did not personally commit the act.

The Murderer is Caught in the Net

Mo Guangcheng is detained in the Third Prison in Shenyang. With the permission of the commander's headquarters, the reporter took a car and traveled more than twenty miles. The wide street outside Dabeimen (Great North Gate), combined with two rows of large trees, was a very peaceful sight. A building painted with protective camouflage stood before us, which was our destination.

The reporter followed the guiding guards upstairs. Two rows of rooms with windows facing each other came into view. The guard shouted "Mo Guangcheng," and immediately a voice answered "Here" from the first room at the head of the stairs. Before the answer was finished, the figure of a young man appeared on the iron window bars, his hands holding the bars, his face pressed against the iron bars, looking at the reporters who were walking forward with a questioning look.

"We are news reporters here to visit you," the reporter explained his identity. He responded to the scene with a bitter smile and an expectant expression.

The structure of the prison cell was Japanese-style, with tatami mats on the wooden floor. Incomplete bedding was laid on the mats, and everyone walked, stood, and lay down on these Japanese-style "tatami." The doors and windows were connected to the edge of the tatami, and the light and air were still sufficient. The diet still followed the quantitative methods of the (Manchu) era. It is said that the prisons in Shenyang are considered the best, because the Japanese also imprisoned Japanese criminals here.

At this time, Mo Guangcheng had been taken out of the prison cell and followed everyone out of the building and onto the balcony. He sat on the short wall and began to talk. It is not known what caused him to be sad, but he burst into tears in front of me. He wiped away the tears with his black shirt and described his family situation, saying: "I am from Xiage Village, Tiechang Town, Zunhua County, Hebei Province. I am 24 years old this year. Because my parents favored me, I did not go to school. After the Lugou Bridge Incident, the Eighth Route Army arrived at my home. All four of my older brothers joined the Eighth Route Army. My eldest brother, second brother, and fourth brother died in battle one after another. My third brother's whereabouts are unknown."

The Tragic Details of the Martyrdom

The conversation about the circumstances of Zhang Xinfu's death began.

Someone asked: "Mr. Zhang Xinfu died so tragically. The Chinese mining industry lost a capable partner, and the country lost a talented person. The knife wounds on his body, and the eyes that did not close after death, still linger in everyone's minds. How could you bear to do it at the time?" Mo Guangcheng said: "I was acting under orders at the time, but I did not stab him myself. It was the platoon leader and the brothers who did it. I was watching from afar."

Then he described the scene at the time, saying: "The train that Zhang Xinfu was riding in was a first-class special train. When it was traveling from Shenyang to Fushun, the train passed Shenjingzi (at that time, the area from Shenjingzi Station was controlled by the Communist army). The local garrison, the First Company of the First Battalion, used a red flag to advise the train to stop, but the train refused to stop (according to what the Soviet army in Shenyang advised Zhang, saying: the journey is not peaceful, do not stop under any circumstances), so they opened fire. When I was stationed in Lishizhai, I received a call from the First Company, saying that the train had left Shenjingzi and that I should immediately detain the train. But before the phone call ended, the train had already passed the place where I was stationed. Later, the brigade headquarters issued an order saying: 'When the train returns to Panyang (Shenyang), it must be detained, and everyone on the train must be arrested. Violators will be dealt with according to military law.' And the brigade commanders were driving around to various stations all day long to supervise the various units. I also didn't sleep for several days because of this. Later, I heard that the train would not be coming back, so everyone relaxed a little.

One day, I forgot the date, around nine o'clock in the afternoon, Liu Ziyi, the deputy commander of the Security Brigade, arrived at Lishizhai Station. At that time, I had gone to the battalion headquarters for important business. Deputy Commander Liu told Chen Guidong, the platoon leader stationed at the station: 'The train taking over the Fushun coal mine is about to return. On the train are also Guo (full name unknown), the political commissar of the Eighth Route Army, a Soviet major (name unknown), (it is said that he was also killed because of this incident), and several Soviet soldiers. Deputy Commander Liu ordered Platoon Leader Chen to arrest Zhang Xinfu and his personnel.

When I returned from the battalion headquarters, Zhang Xinfu and his eight subordinates were already tied up at the station, their overcoats had been taken off, and they were only wearing casual clothes. At that time, the Soviet army had already slipped away on the train, completely abandoning the responsibility of protecting Zhang Xinfu and others.

Later, Deputy Commander Liu ordered me to tie Zhang Xinfu to a south slope in the wilderness about two li (Chinese miles) from the station. Political Commissar Guo gave me the same order, and also said that Zhang Xinfu was a major traitor, and if the Fushun coal mine was taken over by the Kuomintang, the Eighth Route Army would have no way to survive. Because they were not my direct superiors, and at the same time, I didn't know if this order was really correct, so if I was investigated later, I wouldn't be able to take responsibility, so I refused to carry it out. Deputy Commander Liu sent a guard to force me to kill Zhang Xinfu. Under duress, I had to tie Zhang Xinfu and others to the south slope and ordered my soldiers to kill them with bayonets. Zhang Xinfu remained silent before his death, as if nothing had happened, but his attitude was extremely strong. His subordinates were like some poor worms, begging not to be killed!"

Confession in the Light of the Setting Sun

After this incident happened, I went to the battalion headquarters to report, but the battalion headquarters didn't say anything. The next day, Deputy Commander Liu specifically called me to Fushun to comfort me. Then the Soviet army found me for questioning, detained me for more than forty days, and then released me.

I found the ranks and moved from south to north, and soon moved from north to south again. I felt tired in my heart, because I felt that in the past, I was fighting against the Japanese, but now, it was my own people fighting. I didn't want to fight anymore. At the same time, I also missed my home. I wanted to go home. Some people felt the same as me, so we deserted at the same time, a total of about twenty people. Because the escape was not legal, most of the people I was with were scattered by the Eighth Route Army on the way.

I ran to Xifeng and planned to serve the country under the name of Li Deyi, but because I wanted to go home, I left again. On the way, I inquired about the situation in my hometown from the villagers. The result was that I couldn't go back, because my home was still under the rule of the Eighth Route Army. If I ran back illegally like this, the result would not be good.

Unable to make up my mind, I ran to Huludao and stayed at the home of Zhao Peiyun, the sergeant clerk of my company. In order to maintain my livelihood, I sold my watch and got 50,000 yuan in legal currency. I used this money to run a small cigarette business. After doing it for more than ten days, I was arrested by the garrison. My eight years of life in the Eighth Route Army came to an end.

Someone asked him: "Were you in Huludao to do work?" His eyes turned red again, and he said with tears in his eyes: "What would the Communist army send someone illiterate like me to do?" The person refuting him said: "Haven't you received the Communist army's education?" He said: "The education I received was very limited. I can say that everything I have said is true, without any falsehood. I can swear that if I tell lies, I will be struck by lightning when I die."

The setting sun was in the sky, and he ended his conversation with the reporters, saying with emotion: "I was wrong. Kill me or keep me, I hope for a quick end." At the same time, he also repeatedly asked the reporters to "say good things" to the commander, meaning to say some good words for him. The indication from the military law office is that they will collect evidence and then make a decision.

On the way back, two tragic scenes were entangled in my mind: one was Zhang Xinfu, who was covered in knife wounds and had not yet closed his eyes in death, and the other was Mo Guangcheng, the murderer who carried out the cruel orders at that time!

Dear Editor: I am a high school student at a provincial high school. My father is a salaried civil servant, and I have two siblings, all of whom are in school. Our family has little savings beyond basic expenses. My siblings are studying at private middle schools, where tuition is expensive, so they applied for city education loans. Because I am in a provincial middle school, where tuition is lower, I did not apply for a loan. Who knew that today I would receive a bill for nearly 190,000 (first installment of food expenses is 80,000, teacher appreciation fund is 50,000, utilities are 25,000, loss reserve is 10,000, etc.), and two blankets are 20,000. Even though it is called a provincial middle school, the miscellaneous fees are so high, how can the children of salaried civil servants afford to attend? (Cheng Ming)

Unfair Treatment of Postal Workers Transferred

Many postal workers or customs officers are transferred from the Shanghai Post Office or Customs to other locations. If the employee has a large family, moving expenses are astronomical due to current transportation difficulties, which is truly a matter of driving people to their death! Because it is universally known that public servants are poor, it is difficult to bring families along. They can only go alone or with part of their family. Taking someone who earns a base salary of 200 yuan as an example, if they work in Shanghai, they can receive a total salary of 294,000 yuan (base salary of 200 yuan multiplied by the cost of living index of 720, plus a basic amount of 150,000 yuan), which is already barely enough to support their family. Once transferred to another location, taking Gansu and Yunnan as examples, they can only receive a salary of 132,000 yuan (less than half of Shanghai) (multiplied by the cost of living index of 260, plus a basic amount of 60,000 yuan). It is impossible to cover expenses in both locations with this amount, and they are bound to starve, which defeats the purpose of encouraging service in remote areas. Moreover, remittance rates are extremely high now, and the remittance time is extremely slow. Therefore, I urge the authorities to restore the pre-war postal and customs practices for these employees, namely, "if there is a need to cover expenses in two locations, they can receive salaries and allowances based on the higher cost of living location," as a demonstration of the government's compassion for civil servants serving in remote areas. If the postal and customs bureaus can restore the pre-war uniform salary system across all locations, it is indeed what everyone expects. (Hu Guang)

Fraudulent Swindlers - Frequent Roadside Scams

When my father goes out to work, a person in short sleeves and pants suddenly comes, carrying a briefcase and a stack of notebooks, looking like a high-class merchant. He tries to sell my mother something called "Rent Receipt" booklets (see attached), costing 1,000 yuan each. He claims to be dispatched by a certain committee's lawyer's office and forcefully tries to sell ten booklets. My mother refuses, but he coerces her with various words, saying that with this booklet, housing disputes can be resolved. My mother believes him and pays him 10,000 yuan, but he only gives her nine booklets. It was not until I came home that I discovered they were useless scraps of paper. My mother was heartbroken when she found out (because my father's monthly income is only about 200,000). When we went to chase after him, he had vanished without a trace. On the back of the booklet, it is printed that the author is lawyer Yao Yuntuan and the publisher is the Dazhong Publishing House. This is a fraudulent matter, so I especially request your newspaper to expose it and ask the relevant security authorities and all sectors to pay attention to prevent similar situations from happening again. (Lu Baochuan)

Screams from the Edge of Hell

Since Qidong was invaded by the Communist army, it has brought many new tricks: (1) Each person is allocated 500 steps of land. Extra land must be given to them for distribution, for which you get a red flag, which is considered glorious. I got a green flag and a white flag, which is shameful. (2) The total amount of public grain collected in the autumn is 60,000... Qidong's entire population is only 300,000... Calculate how much each person has to bear? (3) Widows are encouraged to remarry and women to give birth to children. The so-called social morality has been completely "liberated." (4) The families of government officials must be killed, and refugees who have fled must also be killed. Why? Because they did not cooperate with them. (5) Beggars in the "liberated areas" must first register with the district government to obtain a registration certificate before they can beg from door to door. In the past two days, the number of refugees continuing to flee from Qidong to Chongming has exceeded 5,000. There is no other hope, only the hope of being able to step back into free homeland as soon as possible!

The Tide of Bankruptcies in Nantong

Dear Editor: Since July, dozens of shops and businesses in Nantong have gone bankrupt and closed, causing a great disturbance throughout the city and disrupting the order of the business community. It started with a man from Anhui named Hong, who opened Tianchengde Tobacco Shop on East Street in the city. It had been in business for many years and was quite prosperous. However, recently, he began to absorb and dismantle bills on a large scale, and on July 3, he suddenly declared bankruptcy. A lawyer was appointed to liquidate the assets. The liquidation resulted in debts of 175 million yuan, but only the remaining 40 million yuan worth of goods were distributed proportionally, only 25%. Most of the creditors were refugees, who were helpless and could only complain in vain, which ended without resolution. After Tianchengde's liquidation concluded, unscrupulous merchants who had been collecting and dismantling bills with malicious intent saw this situation and considered it a good plan. They all felt that the opportunity was rare, so they went bankrupt one after another. Although the authorities paid close attention, it was never heard that anyone had been severely punished or legally sanctioned, and they were all able to escape the law and enjoy their ill-gotten gains. Therefore, the trend has become more rampant and has not stopped. This is a social problem. If strict measures are not taken, who knows what will happen in the future? I hope the economic and financial authorities will pay attention to it! (Hong Qiankun)

### Flames of War in the Northeast

Illustrated Explanation

1. Yingkou: At the end of October last year, China and the Soviet Union began discussing the handover of the Northeast to the National Army in accordance with the agreement, which was scheduled to land in Yingkou. On November 4, General Du Yuming came here once to deploy, but due to Soviet interference and Communist troops' covert encroachment, the National Army's landing was obstructed. Later, the Communist troops built fortifications along the coast, making it the main port for reinforcements from within the pass to the Northeast.

2. Western Liaoning Corridor: On November 17 last year, after the Battle of Shanhaiguan, the Northeast Security Team of the National Army under General Du Yuming entered the Northeast and advanced rapidly along the Beining Railway. On November 25, it stationed in Jinzhou and divided into three routes: the left wing entered Rehe on December 29; the right wing entered Yingkou once on January 9; the main force reached the suburbs of Shenyang on January 15 this year, stationed in Huanggu Village and Beidaying.

3. Airlift to Changchun: At the end of November last year, during the Changchun talks, the government and the Soviet Union discussed the technical issues of the National Army's airlift to the Northeast and reached an agreement. However, after a setback, China and the Soviet Union continued to discuss military liaison matters in mid-December. On January 5 this year, the first batch of National Army began to land in Changchun to take over defenses, and part of them stationed in Sipingjie on the 12th.

4. Shenyang Takeover: From March 7, the Soviet army in Shenyang suddenly began to move north without any prior notice. Their actions were confusing and the situation was extremely chaotic. The Communist troops took the opportunity to seize Dongdaying and Beiling and invaded the city. On the 11th, the National Army entered the city to take over defenses. There was a fierce battle on the south bank of the Hun River in the southern suburbs. Order gradually returned on the 13th.

5. Chaotic Situation in Northern Liaoning: From March 9 to 14, the Soviet army in Northern Liaoning was continuously transferred north, and the situation in various places was extremely chaotic. The Communist troops successively captured Lishu, Kaiyuan, Changtu, and Tieling. On the 17th, they entered Sipingjie, and the traffic south of Changchun on the Middle East Railway was completely cut off. The National Army's New First Army advanced slowly north along the railway from Shenyang on the 17th to take over sovereignty.

6. Battle of Changchun: From March 19, the Soviet army in Changchun began to withdraw, and the situation was uneasy. On April 2, the Communist troops gathered outside and began to attack the suburbs. The National Army in the city was surrounded and cut off from outside aid. After half a month of hard fighting by the isolated army, a mixed battle broke out in the urban area on the 16th, and it was finally lost on the 18th.

7. Battle of Sipingjie: On April 17, the New First Army advanced to the front line of Sipingjie, and the main forces of the two armies came into contact and launched a major battle. The total strength of the two sides reached 150,000. The main force of the Communist army was distributed along the Sipingjie-Gongzhuling line, trying to resist stubbornly to prevent the National Army from advancing north. The National Army confronted and fought head-on in the urban area while simultaneously advancing a part of its forces to the mountainous area of Gongzhuling, flanking the back of Sipingjie, and expanding its wings to attack Liaoyuan and Hailong, making a large pincer movement. On May 17, the right wing suffered a major battle in Xifeng. The Communist army collapsed completely and its momentum was shaken. The main force of the National Army on the front continued to intensify its pressure and entered Sipingjie on the 19th. This major battle, after 32 days of fierce fighting, finally came to an end.

8. Battle of Benxi Lake: In mid-March, the New Sixth Army advanced south from Shenyang along the Middle East Railway and the Anshen Railway in two routes. At the beginning of April, they reached Haicheng and Benxi respectively. At the beginning of May, the Communist army looked north along the Anshen Railway, attempting to attack Shenyang to support the stalemated battle of Sipingjie. In the Battle of Benxi Lake on May 2, 100,000 of the main Communist forces were routed and retreated to the Changbai Mountain area, unable to recover.

9. Northern Sweep: After the Battle of Sipingjie, the combat sequence of the Communist army in the Northeast was scattered, and they retreated to the Xing'anling Mountains, deploying along the north bank of the Songhua River and the Changha Railway. The main force was concentrated in the Qiqihar Fortress, and there was no major battle south of the Songhua River. The National Army advanced north from Sipingjie in full force, conducting a sweep in five routes. The left wing successively reached the Liaoyuan, Shuangshan, and Nongan lines. The main force entered Changchun on May 23, and the two routes continued to advance rapidly towards Harbin and Jilin. The eastern route entered Yongji on the 28th, stationed in Lafa on June 4, and the two routes of the right wing joined forces in Yedian on the 5th. The New First Army reached the Songhua River on May 30 after taking Yaomen. The Communist army blew up the bridge on the Middle East Railway to prevent the National Army from advancing. On June 6, the National Army crossed the natural barrier of the Songhua River estuary, 75 miles south of Harbin, and established a bridgehead in Taolai Zhao. On the 7th, the Northeast Armistice Order reached all lines of the National Army, and all complied with the order to stop advancing.

10. Battle of the Liaodong Peninsula: While the National Army was sweeping the north with the force of an autumn wind sweeping away fallen leaves, the Communist army in Liaodong, in order to contain them, landed in Zhuanghe with reinforcements from Shandong and gathered in the Xiu'an area. From May 24, they launched three surprise attacks on the Middle East Railway, occupying Anshan, Weihai City, and Dashiqiao. After the National Army counterattacked and crushed them, the Communist troops fled to the mountainous area on the border between China and Korea east of Qianshan. The battle ended on June 6.

11. Battle of Lafa: On June 7, the Communist army violated the armistice order and attacked the National Army's positions in Lafa on all fronts in the Northeast. Lin Biao attacked the National Army's positions in Lafa with all his forces, flanking Laoye Ridge and invading Lafa's old and new stations on the 12th. The National Army withdrew to the Daxiao Gujiazi line. By the 14th, the Communist army had withdrawn from Lafa, and the National Army had not stationed there.

12. Miaochun Islands: On June 17, the National Army fleet patrolled the waters of Changshan Islands to monitor the Communist army's route of stealing to the Northeast through the Bohai Strait. By the 22nd, the ships had returned to their defenses one after another.

13. Dalian and Lushun: According to the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance: Dalian is a free port for 30 years; Lushun is a joint naval base for 30 years. On May 22, Marshal Malinovsky, commander-in-chief of the Soviet army in the Northeast, announced that the Soviet army in the Northeast had completed its withdrawal on May 3. In fact, this area is still under its military occupation.

14. Current Contact Area: Since the Northeast Armistice Order was issued, except for the Battle of Lafa, the Northeast front has been generally quiet and uneventful, with only occasional sporadic contacts. Currently, the Communist army is on the move again, sending reinforcements to Taolai Zhao on the Songhua River front and shelling the National Army's bridgehead positions. At the same time, Tieling is surrounded on three sides; Faku is also under attack, but after the National Army rushed to the rescue and suppressed the bandits, the situation remains very stable.

(1) Bone Tuberculosis Ulceration

Cai Xin asks: "In the summer of the 30th year [of the Republic], my wife's left knee ulcerated. She underwent surgery to scrape the bone, but due to economic pressure, she could not complete the procedure and stopped halfway, only buying medicine for self-treatment. For the past five years, the wound, about the size of a silver dollar, has not closed. Please advise on a proper treatment method."

Yin Huizhu asks: (1) "My child is only four years old and suddenly developed swelling in his right knee three months ago. After more than two months of treatment by a Chinese medicine doctor, applying plasters and poultices, it was ineffective. Although he can move now, he feels slight pain when pressed hard. What is this disease?"

(2) "After diagnosis and X-ray examination at a public hospital, because the hospital does not have a doctor specializing in orthopedics, it was equivalent to not seeing a doctor. They only said that the child's knee bones may have T.B. However, the child is only three years and three months old, and currently weighs 15 kilograms, and his development is quite healthy. What are the symptoms of bone tuberculosis? Is it possible for my child to have bone tuberculosis?"

(3) "Please introduce an orthopedic expert with affordable consultation fees and provide instructions on treatment methods."

[Reply from Dr. Gu Yuqi, Doctor of Medicine] Based on the information in your letter, it is likely bone tuberculosis. Diagnosis can be made after X-ray examination. Then, treatment can involve sunlamp therapy followed by applying skin-regenerating medicine, and using a plaster cast to fix the leg. At the same time, take multiple vitamin supplements and inject glucose calcium, vitamin C, etc. Children can also suffer from bone tuberculosis, and the treatment method is the same.

Testicular Tuberculosis

Wang Jun asks: "I recently suffered from swelling in my left testicle, making it difficult to move. After being introduced by your organization to Renji Hospital for treatment, it improved slightly, and it is now easier to move. However, one wave subsides, and another rises. Half a month ago, I suffered from a cough and found blood in my sputum. After X-ray examination, I learned that it was a lung disease and that I needed to be hospitalized for injections, which is very expensive. Please have your doctor advise on treatment methods."

[Reply from Dr. Gu Yuqi, Doctor of Medicine] Based on the information in your letter, it is likely pulmonary tuberculosis and testicular tuberculosis. Because there are already cavities, you are coughing up blood. Artificial pneumothorax is needed, and surgery is needed for testicular tuberculosis.

(3) Blood in Sputum

Chen Xingbao asks: "My younger sister is twelve years old this year and has always been quite strong. Since the beginning of last winter, she suddenly discovered blood in her sputum, but it healed quickly. Who knew it would recur recently, and the amount of blood is more than last year. It comes and goes. I don't know what disease it is. Please answer the following three questions on behalf of your newspaper."

(1) Is this condition dangerous? What is it called?

(2) How should this condition be treated to be effective?

(3) If this condition is left untreated, will it cause adverse consequences?

[Reply from Dr. Gu Yuqi, Doctor of Medicine] It is likely the initial stage of pulmonary tuberculosis. An X-ray examination is needed immediately. If it is necessary to perform artificial pneumothorax, it is hoped that it will be performed immediately.

Letter Received Dear Editor: The information about our school in the letter from Mr. Shao Bingjin published in the Social Services column of your newspaper on September 1 is clearly inaccurate. The funds for our school each semester, in addition to being covered by the tuition paid by students, are far from sufficient. They have always been covered by the members of the entire guild dividing up the expenses on average. The tuition fees collected this semester were previously discussed by the school board and deposited in various guilds for withdrawal at any time. During the deposit period, the interest given was slightly higher to provide assistance, but it was not as much as one dime per month. As for the use of the interest, it is entirely used for (1) the library fund, (2) subsidies for faculty and staff, and (3) repairing school buildings and purchasing equipment. However, the interest is very small because the deposits must be withdrawn at any time, and the interest decreases with the principal. All of our school's expenses, in addition to being covered by all the tuition fees, still require the entire guild to shoulder the insufficient amount. We hereby provide a letter to explain and hope that you will publish it to dispel misunderstandings. To Shen Bao, Board of Directors of Shanghai Private Money Industry Primary and Secondary School

### Philippine Overseas Chinese Schools Severely Lack Teachers

[Nanjing News] There are currently four Chinese middle schools and seventy-nine primary schools in the Philippines, and education is very developed. However, there is a severe shortage of teachers. Those who are hired from the country are often subject to import restrictions, so the local overseas Chinese have repeatedly telegraphed the central authorities to establish overseas Chinese normal schools in the Philippines to cultivate teachers for overseas Chinese education. Regarding this point, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and the Ministry of Education are both considering it. It is also heard that there is a possibility of establishing normal schools in various overseas locations where overseas Chinese are concentrated.

Household Registration Laws and Regulations  Questions and Answers (Continued)  (74) Question:  If someone moves from County A to County B, and has not obtained household registration or temporary household registration in County B, and has not lived there for a month, what kind of registration should be made?  Answer: If the entire household moves out of the county and meets the requirements of Articles 44 and 103 of the Household Registration Law, a transfer registration should be made. Otherwise, a registration of migrated population should be made.

(75) Question: What kind of registration should be made if someone moves in and has not lived there for a month?  Answer: According to the first paragraph of Article 3 of the Provisional Household Registration Regulations, a registration of transient population should be made, or according to the first paragraph of Article 5 of the Migrated Population Registration Regulations, a registration of migrated population should be made.

(76) Question: What kind of registration book should be used for migration within ten days or within the same township?  Answer: The local authorities can develop their own forms.

(77) Question: How should the meaning of "within ten days or within the same township" in the second paragraph of Article 5 of the Migrated Population Registration Regulations be interpreted?  Answer: The former refers to the transient population mentioned in Article 3 of the Provisional Household Registration Regulations, while the latter has no time limit.

(78) Question: How should the migration certificate be used?  Answer: The purpose of the migration certificate is to prove the identity of the migrant for the purpose of inspection, which is equivalent to a temporary identity card. If only one certificate is issued to the head of the household, it can reduce the filling procedures in the township office, but it will be inconvenient for the migrant to move. Therefore, a migration certificate should still be issued separately to each family member who moves together to comply with the regulations. However, to reduce unnecessary procedures, minors can be noted in the migration certificate of their parents, and a separate migration certificate will not be issued.

(79) Question: Is the phrase "migration within ten days" in the second paragraph of Article 5 of the Migrated Population Registration Regulations the same as "transient population who have another residence or domicile elsewhere and come and go frequently" in Article 3 of the Provisional Household Registration Regulations?  Answer: Provisional household registration and migrant population registration are different in nature. The former refers to household registration, while the latter refers to population. The deadline for registration should be specified separately and is not duplicated.

(80) Question: How should migration between Bao and Jia be handled?  Answer: The Household Registration Law stipulates that a registration of application for address change should be made.

Shanghai Municipal Business Tax  To Be Transferred to the Finance Bureau on the 15th  Chamber of Commerce Eagerly Hopes for Improved Collection Procedures  Profits Tax Also Underway  [Our Newspaper] It has been agreed upon by the Municipal Finance Bureau and the Direct Tax Bureau that the Shanghai Municipal Business Tax will be taken over by the Municipal Finance Bureau on October 15th. The autumn business tax due from July 1st will be collected by the Finance Bureau. Matters not yet handled by the Direct Tax Bureau regarding the summer business tax will also be continued by the Finance Bureau. It is also heard that some of the personnel who previously handled business tax in the Direct Tax Bureau will also be transferred to the Finance Bureau for their expertise. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce hopes that after the Finance Bureau takes over, the collection procedures can be further improved for the convenience of merchants and residents.

Last Year's Profits Tax  Falls Short of Government Expectations  Since Director Lou of the Direct Tax Administration came to Shanghai to supervise and urge the collection of the profits tax for the 34th year of the Republic, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau have been actively expediting the process. In total, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has 277 trade associations and 23 merchant members, totaling 300 units. As of September 5th, 237 units have submitted their declarations to the Chamber of Commerce. Some of these have reportedly submitted directly to the Direct Tax Bureau. According to sources in the Tax Committee of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the tax revenue based on the declared figures is very limited. This is because before August of the 34th year, Shanghai was still under enemy-puppet rule. Commodities such as rice, flour, yarn, cloth, coal, iron, and hardware were strictly controlled, and electricity was also strictly rationed, making it impossible to produce. With little business, net profits were naturally low. Since the victory, raw materials, fuel, and transportation have all been in the initial stages of recovery and have not been abundant and smooth. Furthermore, the exchange rate of 200 to 1 for puppet currency has greatly reduced the original book profits of various industries. The Tax Committee of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce is deeply concerned because the Direct Tax Bureau has high expectations for the profits tax budget for the 34th year, but the actual business of various industries in that year was so sluggish. They are now working day and night to calculate the turnover and profit of the declared units in order to create statistics for relevant parties to refer to within this week. It is also heard that the Direct Tax Administration of the Ministry of Finance attaches great importance to the profits tax for the 34th year in Shanghai. Director Wang will reportedly come to Shanghai in person soon to discuss collection methods with responsible persons in the industrial and commercial sectors. The Tax Committee of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce plans to issue certificates to the units that have submitted their survey forms for identification. Those who have not submitted are still expected to do so quickly.

Special Excessive Profits Tax  To Be Collected Starting This Month  The Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau has stipulated the scope and tax rates for the collection of special excessive profits tax in Shanghai, which will begin in September. The collection scope includes: (1) the financial industry (including banks, money shops, silver firms, silver companies, enterprise companies, insurance companies, trust companies, etc.); (2) the trading industry (including those who transport and sell industrial products and agricultural products); (3) the manufacturing industry (including those who manufacture and modify industrial products); (4) middlemen such as agents, brokers, etc.; and (5) the construction industry (such as construction plants and construction companies). The tax rates for profits beyond the total operating capital are as follows: (1) for profits not exceeding 500%, approximately one-seventh of the surplus will be collected; (2) for profits exceeding 500%, 60% will be collected. Taxpayers include state-owned and private enterprises. However, educational, cultural, public welfare, and charitable organizations that use their profits for those purposes are exempt from collection.

Overdrafts Must Be Secured  Money Industry Complies with Orders  Money shops and banks in Shanghai have always required guarantees for overdrafts by depositors. This has now been implemented starting this month, with contracts signed in accordance with regulations. It is learned that all overdrafts from the past have been recovered by the Mid-Autumn Festival. If continued overdrafts are required, new contracts must be signed and proper guarantees must be provided.

Woolen Textile Industry  Requests Delay in Collection of Commodity Tax  Various coarse and fine woolens manufactured by woolen textile factories in our country have long held a position in the domestic goods sector. During the war of resistance, few factories were able to operate due to raw material and power issues. The weak foundation almost collapsed completely. After the victory, factories were waiting to recover, but first, labor strikes occurred one after another, wages increased, costs soared, and sales stagnated. Then, imported goods arrived in large quantities, with low prices and high quality, making it difficult to compete. As a result, all factories were overwhelmed and felt unable to maintain operations, with no way to close down. Since the promulgation of the Commodity Tax Regulations, wool and woolen products have been subject to a 15% tax. The breadth of the scope and the height of the tax rate are absolutely unbearable for the factories. It is learned that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has been requested to forward a letter to the relevant authorities to request a temporary delay in collection, and a temporary general meeting of members will be convened on the 14th of this month to discuss coping strategies in order to maintain the industry.

Eight Types of Public Bonds to Be Drawn  Five Pre-War and Three Wartime  Except for Guangdong Bonds, Payments Will Be Made According to Regulations  The drawing of principal for eight types of public bonds, including the Class B Unified Public Bonds of the 25th year of the Republic, the Long-Term Financial Public Bonds of the 17th year of the Republic, the Guangdong Financial Consolidation Public Bonds of the 25th year of the Republic, the Sichuan Post-War Reconstruction Public Bonds of the 25th year of the Republic, the Guangdong-Hong Kong River Project US Dollar Public Bonds of the 26th year of the Republic, the First Issue of Construction Public Bonds of the 28th year of the Republic, and the Third Issue of Military Needs Public Bonds of the 28th year of the Republic, was held at 9:00 AM on the 9th at the Shanghai Office of the Public Debt Department of the Ministry of Finance. Representatives from the Audit Department, the Silver and Money Industry Association, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce were sent to supervise. A total of 105 bonds were drawn, with a face value of 17,525,000 yuan in national currency and 60,000 US dollars. It is learned that the principal and due interest on the drawn bonds will be paid by the four banks of China, Central, Communications, and Farmers and the Central Trust Bureau in accordance with the original repayment dates stipulated in the bond regulations, except for the Guangdong-Hong Kong River Project US Dollar Public Bonds of the 26th year of the Republic, because the surtax of the Guangdong Customs, which was designated as the repayment fund for this item, was seized by the enemy and could not be remitted as planned. The principal and interest will be temporarily suspended and the resumption date will be set separately after the fund is cleared.

Stock Exchange Urges Payment of Bond Margin  The Shanghai Stock Exchange has announced that the bond market is ready and that brokers who have applied to enter the bond market but have not yet paid their margin, or who have not applied but wish to apply, should complete the procedures immediately. The cash portion of the margin, which is 20 million yuan in national currency, must be paid to the Finance Department of the Exchange by 12:00 noon on the 11th of this month. Late payments will have to wait six months after the market opens before they can be processed.

Northern Traders Buying on the Black Market Yesterday  Public bonds fluctuated yesterday. A large household on the seventh floor sold a lot, but the market was supported by purchases from northern traders on the fifth floor. Tong Bing closed at 2350 yuan, having risen as high as 2780 yuan before falling back to 2280 yuan and then fluctuating again. In the end, Jia and Yi rose 50 yuan, Bing fell 50 yuan, Ding rose 100 yuan, and Tong Wu also rose 50 yuan.

Gold Prices Not Easily Changed Under Strict Control  Gold and banknotes fell slightly yesterday.  Spot gold rose slightly for several days in a row, but retreated slightly yesterday. The Central Bank's control was slightly stricter, and the market was very tired in the middle of the day. The market opened at 2.15 million in the morning, and the Central Bank applied pressure, causing the price to gradually fall from 2.155 million. The Central Bank allocated 177 bars at a price of 2.14 million. After 10:00 AM, the situation deteriorated, and the price fell to a low of 2.117 million before stabilizing. The price recovered slightly to 2.13 million at noon, and remained slightly stable in the afternoon. In the end, the closing price fell 11,000 yuan from the previous day. Jewelry gold was 2.27 million, and silver bullion and silver dollars were flat. Due to the Mid-Autumn Festival, the money market was slightly tighter, and interest rates ranged from 1.5 to 1.8 Jiao.

Foreign currencies also weakened. The US dollar started at 3450 yuan in the morning and was immediately surrounded by sellers. The price fell to a low of 3380 yuan before being maintained. The price fluctuated around 3400 yuan at noon and continued to rise slightly in the afternoon. In the end, the closing price fell 30 yuan from the previous day, with an exchange rate of around 624 yuan to gold. The Hong Kong dollar was initially flat before weakening, falling from 700 yuan to around 690 yuan. In the end, it fell slightly by 5 yuan. The Hong Kong exchange rate was initially stable before weakening, closing at 675 yuan to 685 yuan. The Indian exchange rate was 830 yuan to 840 yuan. The British exchange rate was 11,200 yuan for sale, with little change in the US exchange rate.

Vegetable Prices Soar During Mid-Autumn Festival  Yesterday was the Mid-Autumn Festival, and the prices of all goods soared, especially vegetable prices. Among the meat products, short ribs sold for 2500 yuan per catty, long ribs for 2200 yuan, and leg meat for 3300 to 3400 yuan. Live chickens sold for 3500 to 4000 yuan per catty, ducks weighing three catties sold for 10,000 yuan each, medium-sized ones for 8,000 yuan, and small ones for 5,000 to 6,000 yuan.

Mid-Autumn Festival Passes Peacefully  Silver and Money Industry Breaks Tradition and Does Not Take Holiday  The Mid-Autumn Festival passed peacefully yesterday. The silver and money industry exchanged 52,112 bills on the day, with a total exchange amount of only 125,405,822,000 yuan, a decrease of about 50 million yuan compared to the usual highest amount. This is because the financial payments were cleared before the Mid-Autumn Festival, and the transfer procedures were also completed. The market transaction was light as usual. Old-fashioned shops found it difficult to break traditional habits for a while. According to industry insiders, the money market is not very tight today. According to market practice, every time the silver and money industry takes a holiday, the payments and receipts will inevitably increase the next day, and the money market will inevitably tighten accordingly. This time, the silver and money industry operated as usual, maintaining normalcy, and the market had no major impact today. It is understood that the silver and money industry did not take a holiday this time, which saved some manpower and material resources. However, it also created a historical precedent.

Tea Completely Bought Up  Result of Exchange Rate Adjustment  [Tunxi News] Most of the crude tea from She, Xiu, and Wuyuan counties this year has been successively purchased by tea merchants. However, due to the cautious attitude of silk and tea merchants towards this year's tea market and their relationship with funds, there is still a small amount of crude tea that has not been purchased and remains in the hands of tea farmers. Recently, the news of the tea market has improved slightly due to the exchange rate adjustment, so they have entered the villages to purchase. The crude tea remaining in various places has been completely transferred from farmers to merchants, creating a phenomenon of sweeping the market. The crude tea stored in Wuyuan was also sold out within three days.

Stock Exchange Test Auction  Over-the-Counter Trading of Chinese Stocks Greatly Reduced  Result: Big Stocks Fall, Small Stocks Rise  Due to the stock exchange test auction yesterday, many Chinese stock firms suspended over-the-counter trading, and trading was even less frequent. Popular big stocks were still difficult to see demand, while small popular and unpopular stocks all made progress. The stock price differences continued to narrow. Initially, popular big stocks stood at high prices, while small stocks were still flat. Later, they gradually diverged, with big stocks falling and small stocks competing to rise. In the end, compared to the previous closing, Yongsheng yarn fell slightly, Meiya was flat, and Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing all rose by a strong half. Most of the unpopular stocks made slight progress, while the original stocks were stable.

Foreign stocks continued to rise due to the increasing rumors of the listing of Qianye and Yipi. The rest were difficult to support and all retreated. In the end, with sparse trading, Yipi and Paper continued to rise slightly, while Yisheng, Wheelock, Yee Hong, and Asia all fell slightly. Steel and British Union continued to fall by a strong half.

Stock Exchange Notice  Payment Method for Listed Securities  Advertising Method for Brokers  [Our Newspaper] It is learned that the Stock Exchange authorities have recently sent a letter to the issuing companies of all listed securities, requesting them to pay the listing fees for the securities immediately. According to the Stock Exchange's provisional measures, each share will be charged a listing fee of 1 Jiao. If future orders from the Ministry change these provisional measures, the fees will be increased or refunded accordingly.

The Stock Exchange authorities have also recently instructed all individual brokers that when publishing advertisements in various newspapers, they must indicate the broker's Stock Exchange number and the broker's name, and must not appear solely in the name of the securities company, in order to prevent abuses. Legal person brokers are not subject to this restriction.

Out-of-Town Applications for Sugar  Taiwan Sugar Company Allocates Discretionally  The Allocated Price Will Be Determined by Today's Review Committee  [Our Newspaper] According to a person in charge of the Taiwan Sugar Company, the number of applications from out-of-town users during the twelfth allocation period exceeded 110,000 bags, which did not match the actual consumption. Therefore, they were not allocated as requested. Now, the Social Bureau, in order to sympathize with the difficulties of merchants, has forwarded the application documents of various out-of-town users to the Taiwan Sugar Company. It has been decided that when processing the thirteenth allocation of sugar on the twelfth and thirteenth of this month, the applications from these out-of-town users will also be allocated discretionally. As for the allocation price, it will be allocated according to the price methods set by today's Sugar Price Review Committee.

(2) All manufacturers who borrowed spring cocoon funds this year, operate reasonably, and comply with the loan methods, and new manufacturers with more than 80 silk reeling machines can apply for loans. (3) Manufacturers with spring cocoon loans can transfer their down payment to the purchase of autumn cocoons. New manufacturers applying for loans must pay a 30% down payment according to the loan ratio. (4) The loan interest rate is tentatively set at 2.5% per month. (5) The Farmers Bank of China and the China Silk Company will jointly establish a loan management office to manage the approval, use, and pledge of loans.

After consultation and approval, the contract will be signed and the loan will be issued. Silk manufacturers have been registering with the loan office one after another these days. It is expected that cocoon shops in various places can open one after another starting on the 20th of this month.

The First Day of the Stock Exchange Market Practice  Employees Were Full of Curiosity and Joy  [Special Report] The Shanghai Stock Exchange, which had been called for a thousand times and finally came out, held a grand opening ceremony the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning and afternoon, it continued to practice the procedures for trading, settlement, and reconciliation. The practice results have not yet reached the "realistic" stage. If the official auction is approved on the 12th, I am afraid that the trading procedures will not be as skilled as expected.

Brand New Equipment  Noisy Waves  The leading figures in charge of this Stock Exchange are all experienced people. Therefore, all the designs and measures of the Stock Exchange have their theoretical and practical basis. Since the curtain of the Stock Exchange was opened, everyone has been looking at it with new eyes. The feeling everywhere is novel, especially the new settings such as the trading counters in the market and the establishment of the new settlement and reconciliation system, which are all epoch-making creations in our country. However, precisely because they are too new and too special, the unskilled and rigid scenes of yesterday occurred!

When the reporter arrived at the market, trading had already begun, but the access control was very strict. The reporter finally entered the market under the leadership of Yang Yinpu, the assistant manager of the Stock Exchange. At the entrance, the sound of shouting and selling and the noisy ringing of telephones hit the eardrums directly. It was a mixture of chaos! The six trading counters in the middle row and the brokers' telephone counters in the corridors on the east and west sides were all surrounded by black crowds. The whole transaction was like a raging tide surging and surging!

Distribute Trading Counters and Fill Out Small Market Accounts  Twenty listed securities are distributed on six trading counters. The two counters in the center, No. 9 and No. 10, are matched with six stocks including China Factory, China Underwear, Tongyi Yarn Factory, and Wing On Yarn Factory. The brokers around these two counters are the most crowded. The other two counters, No. 7 and No. 8, are matched with seven stocks including Great China Match, Wing On Company, China Cement, Jingfu, Wuhe Weaving, and Datong Yarn Factory. There are also two counters, No. 11 and No. 12, matched with seven stocks including Jinglun, Xinyu Yarn Factory, China Textile Yarn Factory, China-made Enamel, Xinguang Underwear, Liann Department Store, and Rongfeng Yarn Factory.

Transactions are carried out outside the trading counter. After receiving the client's commission, the broker must go to the designated trading counter to check the market situation if they want to buy or sell a certain stock. In addition to shouting, the transaction should also be assisted by reaching out. The palm is inward when buying and the palm is outward when selling. After the transaction is completed, the selling broker shall make a "small market account" for each transaction, including the type, quantity, price, the numbers of the buying and selling brokers, and the date. Four copies are made and thrown into a special box set up on the designated trading counter for the Stock Exchange to collect at any time. The remaining two copies are held by the buyer and seller as a receipt.

Inside each trading counter, there is a floor clerk standing by with a telephone handset. When each transaction is completed, the floor clerk immediately reports the transaction price to the telephone handset. This telephone is connected to the recorders at both ends of the east and west corridors. There are three recorders at each end, each in charge of the market prices of two or three stocks. After hearing the transaction price, they immediately write it on the blackboard. The brokers' telephone operators in the corridor can contact their business offices at any time to obtain the transaction prices of each stock. When the business office needs to contact the broker or agent in the market, the telephone operator only needs to press a button, and one of the signal lights of the broker specially set up in the center of the market will light up to notify the broker being called.

Reporting Only the Transaction Price Does Not Suit Customers  According to the opinions of the brokers after the exercise of the transaction in the morning, the Stock Exchange only reports the transaction price without reporting the buying and selling prices. The transaction is slow, and it is impossible to find out what the buying and selling prices of a certain stock are at a certain time, which is really not suitable for customers. When the floor clerk reports the transaction price, the shouting price outside the trading counter has already changed, making it difficult for the brokers to handle the limited-price buying and selling for customers. The brokers outside the popular stock trading counters are too crowded and the order is chaotic. To have good order, it will be necessary to arrange shifts for buying and selling, but it will inevitably become slow. On the other hand, the trading counters for unpopular stocks are deserted!

Unfamiliar Procedures  Accounts Cannot Be Reconciled  In the afternoon, we practiced the procedures for settlement and reconciliation. The Stock Exchange authorities had specially compiled the "Collective Reconciliation Method for Securities Trading" for this purpose and distributed it to the accounting staff of each broker to read it carefully. Yesterday, when we practiced on the spot, I don't know whether the accounting staff read it carefully, or the methods set by the Stock Exchange were too profound? After practicing the settlement and reconciliation procedures, we ended up with a rigid and unfamiliar ending! Each accounting staff seemed to have the pain of being at a loss. As a result, none of the transaction accounts of more than 200 brokers could be reconciled!

Hua Wenyu, the chief secretary of the Stock Exchange, said to reporters afterwards: "The process of yesterday afternoon's exercise was not very satisfactory. Today, we decided to practice the procedures for settlement and reconciliation all day long. In the next few days, it may be intensified training!" Yes, the most valuable experience in life is continuous learning. What's more, it is said that many of the brokers in this Stock Exchange have never participated in this kind of noisy trading market. Once they step in, they are at a loss and don't know how to start trading. Since this Stock Exchange has appeared with a brand-new attitude, of course, it is hoped that each broker will also use the latest minds to accept new knowledge and experience. At the same time, it is hoped that the Stock Exchange authorities can take care of the various shortcomings discovered during the exercise period and improve them, otherwise, how can it be worthy of standing side by side with the two major world stock exchanges in New York and London?

Stipulate the Transaction Unit of Various Stocks  According to yesterday's news from the Stock Exchange, the transaction unit of 100 shares includes China Silk Industry and Meiya Silk Factory, the transaction unit of 500 shares includes Great China Match, Jinglun Socks, Tongyi Yarn Factory, Wuhe Weaving, Rongfeng Yarn Factory, and China Textile Yarn Factory, and the transaction unit of 1,000 shares includes China Cement, China Underwear, China-made Enamel, Wing On Company, Xinyu Yarn Factory, Xinguang Underwear, Jingfu Socks, Qinxing Socks, Xinya Pharmaceutical Factory, Wing On Yarn Factory, Liann Department Store, and Datong Yarn Factory.

International Knowledge  US Policy Toward the Soviet Union  Has Become Tougher  By US United Press, Translated by Na Yi  In recent weeks, the United States' policy toward the Soviet Union has quickly become tougher. Developments at the Paris Peace Conference and the MacLean affair further illustrate this point. However, the idea of armed conflict is not yet credible, as there are still many political and diplomatic measures that can be tried.

The tougher US stance toward Moscow seems to be supported by the domestic public. Some experts believe that anti-Soviet sentiment is growing even faster among the people than in official circles.

The fundamental reason for the growing distrust of the Soviet Union is its unacceptable attitude toward various peace-building conferences, as well as its special ambitions in Central Europe.

American public opinion believes that since the victory over Japan a year ago, Soviet diplomacy has been aimed at establishing a "new balance" of power between the East and West systems, rather than striving for universal security worldwide, as the United Nations had hoped for during the war. At the same time, Americans are deeply afraid that the Soviet Union is attempting to foster economic revolutions in formerly democratic countries.

However, all seems not yet lost. Some diplomats in Washington are considering simplifying diplomatic procedures in order to alleviate the current disputes. Lengthy and fruitless debates at conferences have only increased anxiety and have not solved problems. Exchanging notes through normal diplomatic channels, clearly stating the difficulties of the issue, and forcing the other party to express its true opinions may be a more direct and effective approach.

The Soviet Union Will Not Dare to Fight Within Five Years  The idea that a third world war may be coming is considered incredible by authorities, but the theory of a new balance of power is gaining ground.

The Soviet Union has gained a significant amount of land and power during and after the war, and can at least close itself off for a long period of time. Washington believes that the Soviet Union will not dare to engage in another world war for at least five years due to technical problems: (1) It is not yet as advanced as its potential enemies in the production of atomic bombs, although it is believed that the Soviet Union has made significant progress in this area; (2) the Soviet Union's steel production is only a quarter of that of Western countries; (3) the strength of the Western countries' air forces is still stronger than that of the Soviet Union.

On the other hand, Western countries are also not prepared for war. The traditional policy of the United States has always been non-aggressive, and most people believe that effective diplomatic and economic measures can achieve world peace and security. In addition, a large number of Americans have not forgotten that the United States and the Soviet Union were great and powerful allies in the war against Nazi Germany.

Britain also does not seem to be a likely aggressor against the Soviet Union. The problems of Palestine, Egypt, and India are already difficult enough.

Since a new war seems illogical to both Eastern and Western countries, diplomatic observers in Washington believe that the future development will inevitably be a continuation of continuous and firm diplomatic struggle, until the Soviet Union fully understands the determination of Western countries to maintain democracy and limit Soviet expansion.

Therefore, some people in Washington believe that Soviet leaders should take some initiative as soon as possible to restore the trust of Western countries in the Soviet Union, otherwise the gap between East and West will deepen, and some politicians may create new fears about the intentions of the Soviet Union, resulting in a serious situation.

International Weekly  Turbulent Europe with Many Events  The Division Between East and West Has Become a Foregone Conclusion  September 9.  This week, although only seven days long, has seen many disturbing events in the international arena. Not only does it prove that the post-war world is not easy to achieve peace, but it also shows that this troubled world is in turmoil every day. In Asia, the Indian interim government has been formed by Nehru, but the Muslim League has consistently refused to cooperate and will take "direct action," putting India in danger of civil war. In Iran, there has recently been a conspiracy to overthrow the Sadr government. Iran is a country that never has a day of peace. In the Arab countries of Asia, the illegal Jewish immigration issue has caused a great uproar. Britain will convene a round table conference in London to solve the Palestine problem, but the Arabs are unwilling to meet with the Jews. Therefore, this problem is also difficult to have any hope of solving.

Europe Is Turbulent and Fraught with Danger  In Europe, this week is the autumn of many events. The result of the Greek referendum was a victory for the royalists, with 75% of voters supporting the return of King George II. In the eyes of Britain and the United States, this is of course a welcome event, but the Greek left wing does not recognize the results of this referendum. Soviet public opinion also believes that this Greek election was held under the pressure of Britain and the United States and cannot be regarded as the free will of the Greek people. Therefore, international contradictions, coupled with internal problems in Greece, have intertwined into very complex international problems. The Greek civil strife has reached a final juncture, posing a great threat to the peace of the Balkans.

The Conflict Between Britain and the Soviet

### Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Education in Beiping and Tianjin: The Whereabouts of Received Japanese Artifacts Remain Unknown

The Investigation Team Ultimately Slams the Table and Roars in Anger

[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 10th] A certain Japanese collector once possessed a large collection of books, antiques, calligraphy, and paintings. After the victory against Japan, the Office of the Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Education in the Beiping-Tianjin area received them. Recently, an investigation team arrived in Beiping to investigate the whereabouts of these books and artifacts, but they are missing. The Beiping Office of the Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Education claimed that the Tianjin Office of the Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Education received them. The investigation team then summoned Wang Renyuan of the Tianjin Office for questioning. According to Wang, the books and artifacts were received by the Beiping Office, and he could not be held responsible. At the time, the investigation team sternly questioned him, and Wang slammed the table and roared in anger. The two sides parted on bad terms. Later, the investigation team issued a warning, correcting Wang's attitude, stating that Wang had an obligation to answer questions. However, the truth of this case remains unclear to this day.

As of now, approximately one-half of the faculty, staff, and students from the relocated schools have reached their destinations, approximately one-quarter are en route, and one-quarter remain in the rear areas.

### Teachers' Salaries Cannot Be Higher Than Civil Servants

Mayor Wu Responds to Representatives of the Shanghai Municipal Secondary School Teachers' Association. At the invitation of Mayor Wu this month on the 7th, the Shanghai Municipal Secondary School Teachers' Association sent 12 representatives from the board of directors to the municipal government conference room to present their opinions on improving teachers' salaries, hoping that the Education Bureau would pay salaries on the 15th of each month to meet teachers' living expenses and budget, and that the arrears for August would be paid immediately. They also requested an adjustment to the basic salaries of faculty and staff. Mayor Wu immediately expressed earnestly that he would do his best to protect the rights of all faculty and staff. He stated that the delayed payment of salaries in the past would be improved as much as possible in the future. However, the government authorities set the salaries of civil servants and teachers, and teachers' salaries could not be higher than those of civil servants. He said that it would be difficult to comply with other requests from teachers. It is reported that the association will convene a board of directors meeting on the afternoon of the 14th to discuss everything.

### The First Act of the Women's Volleyball Finals: Wang Weizhen's Outstanding Saves; Friendship Team Wins Thrillingly Over Friendship Association; Class B Soviet B Wins Over Huaguang; Renyu Team Loses to Huayanhua

[Our Dispatch] The first act of the three-way round robin among the top women's volleyball teams, Friendship Team vs. Friendship Association, unfolded last night. As a result of a thrilling match, Friendship Team defeated Friendship Association by a score of two to one, wiping away the humiliation of their previous defeat, fulfilling their wish. Before that, there were two acts of the Class B finals. In the first match, Soviet B easily defeated Huaguang, and Huayanhua powerfully defeated Renyu. The scores were both two to zero. The situation in the three matches was as follows:

In the first match of the Class B finals, Soviet B relied on its height and strength, frequently delivering smashes. The team has absolute ambition for the Class B championship. Their strength is indeed among the best in Class B. They successively won the first two games with scores of 21-7 and 21-13. Judging from the performance of Soviet B, it is very likely to win the championship. In the second match, Huayanhua vs. Renyu, the former was more balanced, with someone on both offense and defense. In the first game, Luo Yanhua won 21-17. In the second game, Renyu was extra cautious, but ultimately could not avoid a crushing defeat. The score was 22-20. Huayanhua won two to zero.

Women's Group Battle

In the final match, the women's group unfolded a great battle. The Friendship Team was determined to avenge their defeat and went all out from the start. Huang Mingyuan and Zhang Yixuan unleashed their power together, while Friendship Association relied on Chen Meizhen's fierce spike, closely following behind. The scores fluctuated until 14 points each. Then, the Friendship Team suddenly found their rhythm, and Wang Weizhen's saves were meritorious, allowing them to take the lead all the way, instantly winning the first game 21-14. Friendship Association was not discouraged in the first game. When the Friendship Team took the lead 10-7, Friendship Association gave a shout, and the entire team displayed tacit cooperation, with the score gradually rising, resulting in Friendship Association winning a game back with a score of 21-13.

Final Victory

In the final game, at a critical moment of life and death, the Friendship Team was determined to win. They worked together with one heart, either smashing or hitting, all with ease. Wang Weizhen's brave saves and Chen Meizhen's spikes were both wonderful performances. At 11-7, the Friendship Team took the lead and switched sides. Friendship Association was distracted, allowing the Friendship Team to do whatever they wanted. The Friendship Team then secured the final victory with a score of 21-15. The results of the three matches are as follows:

[Friendship Team] Rong Shujian, Zhang Yixuan, Liu Zhenbao, Wu Lielei, Wang Weizhen, Huang Mingyuan, Yang Wenjuan, Xiang Yulin, Situ Mei.

[Friendship Association] Zhu Jinhu, Chen Meigong, Lu Cuifang, Chen Liuzhen, Shen Meiying, Lin Yueduan, Lu Zhaoshan, Chen Jieshu, Zhu Leen.

### The Qunsheng Basketball Team from the Philippines Still Hasn't Arrived in Shanghai

Lin Zhuguang, the leader of the Qunsheng Basketball Team from the Philippines, called from Xiamen the day before yesterday, saying that the team was scheduled to take China National Aviation Corporation's C-46 plane to Shanghai at 4:00 PM yesterday. Therefore, Qian Xuchang, chairman of the Basketball Association, immediately prepared for the welcome yesterday and, at 3:30 PM, together with Zhang Xiang, leader of the Hualian Basketball Team, Liu Hesheng of the Basketball Association, Cai Dawen, representative of Qunsheng in Shanghai, and Zhang Liangxiong and others, totaling more than ten people, departed from the Municipal Gymnasium in three passenger cars, arriving at Longhua Airport at 4:00 PM sharp. However, waiting until 5:30 PM, only one plane, number 108, landed, but the Qunsheng athletes were not seen. According to a passenger on the plane carrying a message from Qunsheng, plane number 108 (which came to Shanghai via Hong Kong and Xiamen) was unable to board passengers from Xiamen because there were many passengers from Shantou. The C-46 plane that the team was originally scheduled to take had not taken off from the Philippines, so Qunsheng is currently still in Xiamen waiting for a flight north.

[Another dispatch] The China National Aviation Corporation's C-46 plane has flown directly to Shanghai from the Philippines and did not stop in Xiamen on the way. Therefore, the Qunsheng team may not be able to leave Xiamen in one or two days.
