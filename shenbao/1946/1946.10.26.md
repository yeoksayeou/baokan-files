[Our Newspaper, Taipei, 25th Dispatch] The Chairman, accompanied by his wife, attended the Retrocession Commemoration Welcome Rally at 10:22 AM on the 25th. The wife entered first, followed by the Chairman and Chen Yi with his wife. There were five minutes of cheers, and the Chairman smiled and nodded in acknowledgment. After Chairman Huang, representing the Taiwanese people, paid respects, the Chairman delivered a speech lasting thirty minutes, greeted by thunderous applause from over two thousand representatives from all walks of life. The Chairman, holding his military cap, said with a smile: "Thank you, fellow compatriots." He then met with the public on the balcony in front of the Retrocession Hall, repeatedly saying: "Thank you." It is historically significant that Zhongshan Hall was where the surrender took place last year, and now the Chairman has personally come.

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 25th Dispatch] The welcome rally for the Chairman and his wife on the anniversary of Taiwan's retrocession was held on the morning of the 25th at Taipei Zhongshan Hall. The rally was originally scheduled to begin at 10:00 AM, but was delayed until 10:20 AM due to welcoming crowds obstructing the Chairman and his wife's car en route. They arrived accompanied by Chief Executive Chen Yi. The crowd standing in front of the venue cheered, their voices echoing in the sky. Party, government, and military leaders greeted them and led them inside. Over two thousand representatives from various organizations, schools, and groups stood up in unison to pay their respects. The Chairman, in military uniform, looked radiant and cheerful. The wife wore a navy blue floral qipao with a black coat. The whole venue erupted in enthusiastic applause and cheers. Mayor You Mijian announced the start of the rally. After formal salutations, Provincial Assembly Speaker Huang Chaoqin stood before the platform and respectfully read a tribute to the Chairman (separate dispatch). The Chairman nodded frequently in thanks. The Chairman then delivered a speech (full text in separate dispatch), which Mayor You translated into Taiwanese. The entire audience listened intently and silently, without any signs of fatigue. Afterward, Youth Corps Secretary Wang Wenhui and Women's Association Wu Qianqian, representing the people and women of the province respectively, presented the Chairman and his wife with banners reading "Merit Shines Throughout the Universe" and "Virtue Permeates Formosa," respectively, amidst melodious music. The Chairman and his wife accepted the banners with smiles, and the entire venue thundered with applause. Mayor You then led the crowd in chanting: "Long live Chairman Chiang, who has worked hard and made great contributions!" "Long live Chairman Chiang, who brought glorious victory!" "Long live Chairman Chiang, who recovered Taiwan!" "Long live Mrs. Chiang!" "Long live Taiwan of the Republic of China!" "Long live the Chinese Nationalist Party!" "Long live the Republic of China!" The rally concluded with cheers. As the Chairman and his wife stepped down from the podium, they waved their hats to the audience and said: "Good, good, fellow compatriots, goodbye, goodbye." The Chairman and others then entered the VIP room to rest for five minutes before going to the rooftop terrace to receive cheers and tributes from over ten thousand people gathered outside Zhongshan Hall. The Chairman then delivered another brief address, saying: "Compatriots, today is the happiest day for Zhongzheng and his wife. Seeing you all, I am truly overwhelmed with joy. What I want to encourage all Taiwanese compatriots is that I hope you will work especially hard for the motherland, for Taiwan, so that Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People can be realized, and a unified, independent, democratic, and Three Principles-based new China can be built. I wish all compatriots good health!" As soon as the address was finished, the crowd shouted: "Long live Chairman Chiang!" At this moment, the Chairman also raised his hand and shouted: "Long live the Taiwanese compatriots! Long live! Long, long live!" Taiwan was under Japanese rule from May 9, 1895, to October 25, 1945, for 50 years, 5 months, and 16 days. It was the first time in history that the Taiwanese people had witnessed the demeanor of the head of the motherland. The high emotions of the Taiwanese people today clearly moved the Chairman deeply. The Chairman then left the venue and went by car to National Taiwan University to attend the opening ceremony of the provincial sports meet.

[Another Dispatch] After the news that Chairman Chiang and his wife would attend the welcome rally this morning spread, various schools, organizations, and citizens waited along the scheduled route early in the morning, holding small national flags in their hands. The Chairman and his wife, accompanied by Chief Executive Chen Yi, departed from the Government House in a jeep. When they reached Jiantan Bridge, they were blocked by welcoming crowds on both sides, so they slowly proceeded through the crowds along Zhongshan Road, Zhongzheng Road, Chongqing South Road, and Hengyang Street to reach the Zhongshan Hall venue. The cheers of "Long live" from the people along the way never stopped. The Chairman stood in the jeep, smiling and nodding frequently to both sides, and waving his hand. At 10:20 AM, the car arrived at Zhongshan Hall, and the crowd waiting in front of the gate also cheered, their voices echoing in the sky. The air force also sent planes to fly overhead and distribute propaganda materials.

[Another Dispatch] Today is the anniversary of Taipei's retrocession, and grand rallies are being held in all counties and cities to celebrate. Telegrams of respect were sent to Chairman Chiang and Chief Executive Chen Yi.

### Full Text of Chairman Chiang's Address

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 25th Dispatch] The full text of Chairman Chiang's address at the welcome rally for the Chairman and his wife on the anniversary of Taiwan's retrocession on the 25th is as follows:

Fellow Compatriots:

Today, as we joyfully celebrate the first anniversary of Taiwan's retrocession, I, Zhongzheng, have come to attend this celebration rally, to gather with my Taiwanese compatriots who have been separated for fifty years, to celebrate the retrocession together. It is truly the most pleasant and glorious day of my life, fulfilling my fifty-year-long aspiration.

Our Taiwan Province was ceded to Japanese imperialism by the foolish Qing government on April 17th of the Jiawu Year (1895), and has been under enemy occupation for as long as fifty-one years. During these fifty-one years of suffering, the compatriots of Taiwan Province not only suffered oppression by the Japanese, enduring various political and economic abuses and inequalities, but all of our compatriots across the country were also constantly concerned about this island that was robbed, and the compatriots on the island who were forcibly separated. Our Founding Father advocated the National Revolution, with the retrocession of Taiwan as one of the main goals of the revolution. In the year that Taiwan was lost, the Founding Father established the Revive China Society in Honolulu, and in the declaration issued at the time, he put forward the slogan "Restore Taiwan, consolidate China." Since then, our national revolutionaries, as well as Zhongzheng himself, have worked tirelessly in accordance with the Founding Father's teachings, determined to wash away national humiliation and fully restore Taiwan. In the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), our entire country unanimously launched the sacred and heroic war of resistance against Japan, and the retrocession of Taiwan became an active goal for our revolutionary comrades. Therefore, on April 1st of the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938), I clearly announced at the Provisional National Congress of the Kuomintang: "Taiwan is our Chinese territory, and geographically, it is the lifeline related to China's survival and security. If China wants to truly pursue national defense and maintain lasting peace in East Asia, we must never allow our Taiwan to be permanently ruled by Japanese imperialism. In order to achieve our National Revolution and prevent ambitious countries from disrupting East Asia, we must target the active conspiracies of Japanese imperialism and make the liberation of the Taiwanese people our mission." This is what the Founding Father often instructed me personally and other comrades. The Founding Father meant that we must enable the Taiwanese compatriots to restore equality and freedom in politics and economy, and enable every Taiwanese compatriot to restore their status as the masters of the country, so that we can consolidate the national defense of the Republic of China and lay the foundation for peace in East Asia.

### President Soong Arrives in Shanghai by Plane

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 25th Dispatch] Premier Soong's special plane left Taiwan at 10:30 AM on the 25th.

### Attending the Cairo Conference: Determined to Recover Taiwan

With the determination and perseverance of the people of the whole country, enduring countless losses and sacrifices of lives and property, we waged a tenacious and heroic war of resistance against the brutal Japanese. In the 32nd year of the Republic of China (1943), I personally went to Cairo to hold a tripartite conference with the leaders of Britain and the United States, and decided that Japan should "return to China all the territories Japan has stolen from the Chinese, such as Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, and the four northeastern provinces." Thus, Taiwan, which we had lost for fifty years, was determined to be a part of our Republic of China. On August 15th of last year (1945), the Japanese military completely collapsed and declared unconditional surrender to our Allies. Our country immediately proceeded with the work of recovering the lost territories according to the pre-arranged plan, and with the enthusiastic assistance of our friend, the United States, all the restoration work was able to be completed smoothly. On this day last year, our Central Government specially appointed the current Chief Executive Chen to come to Taiwan as the Administrative Chief Executive of your Taiwan Province and Commander-in-Chief of the Garrison to accept the surrender and administer the government. Compatriots, today last year was the day when Taiwan Province was officially incorporated into our country's territory.

### Remember the Revolutionary Martyrs: Expand the Spirit of Patriotism

Compatriots, today is truly the most precious day for all our compatriots across the country, and especially the most glorious day for the compatriots of Taiwan Province. Everyone must know that the retrocession of Taiwan is a major achievement that is extremely difficult and hard-won. Since our Founding Father initiated the revolution, for the sake of the compatriots and land of Taiwan, we have been engaged in a long-term and continuous fierce and painful struggle with Japanese imperialism, whether visible or invisible, at all times. During this war of resistance, our compatriots across the country have suffered countless direct and indirect sacrifices, and we do not know how much blood of patriots has been shed, and how many heads of compatriots have been lost, before this Taiwan, which had been occupied for fifty-one years, returned to the embrace of the motherland. However, during these fifty-one years, although our Taiwanese compatriots suffered such brutal oppression from the enemy, the traditional spirit of the Chinese national revolution has not been lost in the slightest. Since the end of the Ming Dynasty and the beginning of the Qing Dynasty, after the national hero Zheng Chenggong resisted the Manchus and restored Taiwan, Tang Jingsong, Liu Yongfu, Qiu Fengjia, and others continuously led the Taiwanese people to resist the brutal Japanese, all of which were glorious and tragic acts that shocked the heavens and moved the gods. Even during the Japanese occupation, the anti-Japanese movement of the compatriots in this province continued unabated. Events such as the Lin Dabe incident and the Jian Dashi incident were all expressions of the patriotic revolutionary spirit. I deeply hope that all compatriots in the province will remember the historical facts of the national and Taiwanese revolutionary martyrs who sacrificed generously and restored Taiwan with great difficulty. From now on, we should endure hardship, unite and cooperate, expand the patriotic and revolutionary spirit and perseverance of the martyrs, and work together to build a new Taiwan and a new China based on the Three Principles of the People.

### Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek Receives Taiwanese Women Leaders

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 25th Dispatch] Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek, at 5:00 PM on the 25th, after receiving US Consul Blake, Vice Consul Kyle, US Information Service Director Catto and Mrs. Catto, also received Ge Yunyi, lecturer at Taiwan Normal College, Ren Peidao, principal of Taipei Women's Normal School, Xie E, chairman of the Taiwan Provincial Women's Association, Zhu Xiurong, principal of Fuxing Kindergarten, and more than ten directors of women's associations in various counties and cities. Mrs. Chiang encouraged the women of Taiwan Province to engage in the following: (1) Participate in various activities to cultivate women's political awareness. (2) Engage in productive enterprises to improve the lives of women in Taiwan Province. (3) Establish nurseries. (4) Recruit women party members. Mrs. Chiang also asked Mrs. Chen Yi to serve as the chairman of the Taiwan branch of the Women's Guidance Association.

### Rebuild Taiwan: Become a National Model

Compatriots, it has been a full year since Taiwan Province was restored to our nation. Although I have been unable to come to Taiwan to comfort my compatriots this year due to the busy affairs of the country, my thoughts of the compatriots of Taiwan Province have never ceased. Based on reports from various sources, I am deeply aware of the long-term suffering endured by the compatriots in this province during the occupation, and I also know that the compatriots in this province have suffered considerable losses and destruction during the war. After the retrocession, due to the war-time destruction, there have been many difficulties and obstacles in the work of restoration and reconstruction. Although this suffering and these difficulties are all remnants of the exploitation by Japanese imperialism, now that Taiwan has returned to the embrace of our motherland, and every one of our compatriots has become the master of the country, we should all do our utmost to fulfill our responsibilities and obligations as masters of the country, quickly eliminate the remnants of Japanese militarism, and rebuild Taiwan anew.

Regarding the work of restoration and reconstruction, on the one hand, the local government must actively promote it, and on the other hand, all our compatriots in the province must cooperate fully, coordinating and advancing towards one goal and one direction, in order to successfully complete the task. The material conditions in this province are quite favorable, national education is very popular, and the people's representative bodies have all been established. With the joint efforts of the people and the government, under the leadership of Chief Executive Chen, I believe that the future of Taiwan Province will be bright and promising, and it will surely become a model province for the whole country.

### Cherishing All Compatriots in the Province: Far More Than Any Other Province

As for our Central Government's view of Taiwan, it is like brothers and sisters who have been separated from their family for fifty years, and the emotions of reunion and gathering together once they return home. Only those who have personally experienced it can thoroughly understand this feeling of pity and love, only hoping that they can be happier and more advanced, and not be discouraged, passive, disappointed, or disheartened because of the enemy's attacks. Therefore, the quick completion of the restoration of this province is not only eagerly anticipated by the compatriots of this province, but also by the Central Government. For all matters that are reasonable and beneficial to the restoration and construction of Taiwan, the Central Government has been constantly urging and instructing the Chief Executive's Office to actively promote them. Today, I can announce to all the compatriots in the province that the Central Government's love for Taiwan far exceeds that of any other province in the country, and the Central Government's emphasis on the construction of Taiwan also exceeds that of other provinces. I hope that all our compatriots in the province can work together and strive harder to build a new Taiwan based on the Three Principles of the People, and fulfill your responsibilities as masters of the country, because building a new Taiwan is part of building a new China, and building a new China is the ultimate goal of our National Revolution.

Today is the anniversary of Taiwan's retrocession, and I am able to personally see the compatriots who have suffered enemy oppression for as long as fifty-one years, celebrating wildly under the banner of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth, and my heart is filled with unspeakable joy. Now, I pray for the blessings of heaven, and silently pray to the spirits of the Founding Father and the revolutionary martyrs in heaven, so that our Taiwanese compatriots can be stronger, more advanced, more free, and more happy, in order to fulfill your mission of restoring the country!

[Another Dispatch] Full Text of Chairman Chiang's speech at the Provincial Games on the 25th:

Athletes, young people, and children of the Taiwan Provincial Games:

Today, Zhongzheng and his wife have come to Taiwan to participate in the Taiwan Provincial Games and to meet with our Taiwanese young people and children, and I feel immensely gratified in my heart. Our Taiwan has been separated from the motherland for fifty-one years. Fortunately, with the long-term and arduous struggle of our compatriots across the country, we were finally able to liberate our Taiwan from the iron hooves of Japanese imperialism on this day last year, allowing our Taiwanese compatriots to return to the embrace of the motherland and gain a position of freedom and equality. This is truly a major event worthy of our joy and encouragement. However, everyone must know that you have now returned to the embrace of the motherland and have become the masters of the Republic of China, and therefore must shoulder the responsibilities of the country. This time, Zhongzheng has come to Taiwan to entrust the responsibility of building Taiwan and the responsibility of building the country to our compatriots - especially our Taiwanese young people. I hope that our compatriots, especially young people, can all recognize their responsibilities, work together to study diligently, cultivate strong physiques, and restore the inherent morality of our Chinese nation, that is, to understand propriety, justice, integrity, and a sense of shame, to be responsible, and to abide by discipline. Only in this way can we ensure the status of the masters of our country, consolidate our territory of Taiwan, and fulfill our obligations as the masters of our country. It is also only in this way that we can build our Republic of China into a new country based on the Three Principles of the People, rich, strong, healthy, and happy. Finally, I wish all the young people and children who participate in the Provincial Games today the glory of victory and progress under strict discipline and order.

### The Third Party Continues Its Efforts: Preparing to Put Forward New Proposals: Concrete Conclusions Have Been Reached on Some Issues

The third party is continuing its efforts, hoping to facilitate the immediate opening of a formal meeting. At 10:40 AM on the 25th, Luo Longji, Miao Jiaming, and Li Huang went to the US Embassy to visit Ambassador Stuart, and Special Envoy Marshall also came to participate.

We hope that the chairman will fly back as soon as he finishes his official duties in Taiwan so that we can receive your guidance.

### Speaker of the Taiwan Provincial Assembly Reads a Tribute to the Chairman on Behalf of the Entire Province: Resolves to Contribute Human and Material Resources to the Motherland

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 25th Dispatch] Huang Chaoqin, Speaker of the Taiwan Provincial Assembly, declared a tribute to the Chairman on behalf of the people of the entire province at the welcome rally for the Chairman and his wife on the anniversary of Taiwan's retrocession on the morning of the 25th, stating briefly: "Today is the anniversary of our celebration of Taiwan's retrocession. We are delighted to have our great leader Chairman Chiang and his wife visiting Taiwan. All Taiwanese compatriots feel infinite excitement and happiness. This is the most glorious day for all Taiwanese compatriots, and it is also a day of special historical significance. Everyone knows that it was thanks to Chairman Chiang's leadership in the arduous long-term war of resistance that our China was able to be revived, and the retrocession of this province today is due to Chairman Chiang and Mrs. Chiang's negotiations at the Cairo Conference three years ago, which won the strong guarantee of the two major allies, Britain and the United States, and laid the foundation for this new situation. Fifty-one years ago, Taiwan fell into the hands of the enemy. During this period, Taiwanese compatriots suffered hardship and humiliation, but they always missed the motherland. Therefore, they have been able to preserve the culture, language, writing, customs, and habits of this motherland to this day. Today, our compatriots throughout the province have returned to the embrace of the motherland, accepted the inspiration of the Three Principles of the People, and jointly obtained the happiness of equality and freedom. Moreover, the cause of all restoration and construction is progressing, and the future is unlimited. We respectfully swear that under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, we will work hard to build the country, contribute all the human and material resources of Taiwan to the motherland, so that every Taiwanese person can become a powerful member of the country's construction, and make Taiwan a powerful province for the country's construction. Only in this way can we repay the merits of our great leader, and repay our country and nation. On behalf of the 6.3 million compatriots in the province, we express our highest respect and deepest gratitude to our Chairman and Mrs. Chiang! We respectfully request the Chairman and Mrs. Chiang to provide us with more instructions so that we can follow them, and we respectfully wish the Chairman and Mrs. Chiang good health."

The National Army in that area is on alert. Furthermore, five *li* west of Chenguantun, about 1,000 Communist troops crossed the river to attack last night, clashing with the defending troops.

### National Army Advancing Southward on the Northern Section of the Pinghan Railway; Searching Forward on Both Wings; Reconstructing Pillboxes on Reclaimed Railway Sections

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 25th] The war on the northern section of the Pinghan Railway has temporarily subsided due to peace negotiations. The Eleventh War Zone Command Headquarters has not yet announced the meeting of the National Army from the north and south on the 25th. Currently, a vacuum seems to exist north and south of Xushui. The National Army moving south from Beiping is still quietly searching forward on both wings, but no battle reports have been released. The National Army moving north from Baoding once crossed the Caohe River and advanced north, but was later blocked and pushed back by the Communist Army. Railway repair work is progressing along with military developments. The authorities originally planned to build south to Dingxing by the 23rd, but due to a lack of materials, only the section between Zhuoxian and Songlin Town has been repaired so far, and it can be opened to traffic immediately. Repairs are currently being rushed to Gaobeidian, which should be open to traffic in five or six days. Furthermore, one of the main forces of the Communist Army that destroyed the Pinghan Railway, with more than 4,000 men, is still occupying villages more than ten *li* west of Laishui, preparing to attack at any time.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 25th] The repair of the northern section of the Pinghan Railway is problematic after Gaobeidian due to a lack of materials. The Hebei Provincial Government and the Pinghan Railway Bureau will issue proclamations to the people along the route, urging them to quickly hand over the railway materials left behind by the Communist Army, otherwise they will be considered "collaborators with bandits." There is also a proposal to dismantle the double-track railway outside Shanhaiguan for use. Currently, pillboxes on both sides of the railway are being rebuilt in the recovered areas. The authorities are also considering digging protective trenches and building strong walls on both sides to maintain traffic. The destruction of the stations is particularly severe, with no buildings remaining. Personnel at Songlin Town Station are using two iron freight cars for office work. Only thirty complete houses remain in the city of Dingxing.

[Central News Agency, Baoding, 25th] The Communist forces surrounding Baoding have suffered heavy casualties due to counterattacks by the National Army, and are actively moving towards the mountains of Mancheng and Laiyuan northwest of Baoding.

### Taiwan Hualien County Alluvial Gold Mine Development Plan Has Been Drafted; Reserves Reach 240 Tons

### Actively Developing the China Petroleum Corporation; Ganqing Branch Established in the Northwest

[Report from our Newspaper] Our reporter recently interviewed Mr. Xu Zhuanghuai, Chief Secretary of the China Petroleum Corporation, inquiring about the company's recent work. He responded that in terms of production, the Ganqing Petroleum Branch has been established in the Northwest to continue developing the Yumen Oil Field. The oil refining equipment ordered from the United States had previously arrived in batches, but unfortunately, a significant amount was lost during the Communist army's attack on the Longhai Railway line. Therefore, the development of the oil field has been considerably affected. Exploration work in the Northwest is still ongoing in the hope of discovering new oil sources. As for the Wusu Oil Field in Xinjiang, it was shut down due to the removal of machinery, and due to the situation, it has not yet been repaired. Recently, the company has begun repairing the Kaohsiung oil refinery in Taiwan, which was left behind by the Japanese and was previously used to refine naval oil. Once operations begin, its output can supply the southeastern coastal area. Regarding the management of imported petroleum, the detailed figures cannot be disclosed due to their confidential nature. What can be said is that the imported petroleum and diesel are divided into three parts: military and transportation agencies consume the largest quantity, and their allocation is prioritized; secondly, the oil required by private enterprises can also be requested according to procedures, based on their actual needs; thirdly, the remaining petroleum is handed over to Mobil, Asiatic, and Texaco for commercial use. The purpose of managing petroleum is not passive control but to seek fair and reasonable allocation and to maintain stable oil prices.

Editorial

### Commentary on Recent Events Concerning Christian Churches

Amidst the turbulent international situation of today, news related to Christian churches has been occurring frequently lately. The execution of the Yugoslav archbishop has aroused dissatisfaction from the Vatican. According to news from Agence France-Presse, the Pope in Rome is also planning to issue a statement condemning it. While this formal condemnation from the Holy See has not yet been released, news agencies from Rome are reporting that a Yugoslav girl is planning to assassinate Pope Pius XII. The Vatican has remained silent and made no comment regarding the attempted assassination report. Therefore, the credibility of the aforementioned report is questionable. Regardless of whether there is an actual assassination attempt on the Pope, the existence of such a report suggests that it is not without reason and may have some basis. At the same time, Archbishop Victor of the Russian Orthodox Church in Shanghai was recently arrested by our authorities. According to reports, he is suspected of being a war criminal and has been transferred to the court. It is also reported that he has been released on bail. The arrest of Archbishop Victor has shocked the Russian community in Shanghai. Now that the case has been transferred to the judicial organs for trial, the truth will surely come to light. Therefore, we do not wish to comment on this case. We are merely citing a few examples to show that news concerning Christian churches has been happening frequently recently.

I remember when President Roosevelt was still alive, and the Big Three were still meeting from time to time, Roosevelt and Churchill spoke to Stalin about the importance of the Pope's role in international life. Stalin retorted by asking them how many divisions the Pope possessed. This certainly reflects a materialistic view: but perhaps Stalin, who was from the Greek, that is, Russian Orthodox Church monastery, was the one who could truly recognize the Pope, who did not possess a single soldier. It is said that Stalin believed that his ultimate enemy was not London or Washington, but the Vatican. Perhaps this is why, in our so-called "liberated areas," the Roman Catholic Church suffered the most from being "liberated" and "liquidated." Tito's Yugoslavia, as everyone knows, has become a vassal of Moscow. Therefore, the Catholic Church in Yugoslavia, like the Catholic Church in Slovakia, is naturally included in the ranks of "liberation" and "liquidation." This is why we have seen the execution of the Archbishop in the Catholic Church in Yugoslavia, and in order to respect and uphold the four freedoms stipulated in the Atlantic Charter, which were also accepted by the Soviet Union, we have seen Catholics everywhere condemning the Yugoslav Archbishop incident.

Communism, in its essence, is a kind of atheistic "religion." This "religion," combined with the intense religious sentiments of the Russian people, makes the Russian people even more aware of their mission. Moscow has been called the "Third Rome," and now the international center of the Communist Party is in Moscow, which makes the Russian people feel that they have a sacred mission to "liberate" all mankind with communism. Therefore, when the revolutionary fervor subsided, when there was war to resist foreign invasion, which aroused the intense religious emotions of the Russian people, Stalin, who came from a Russian Orthodox Church monastery, grabbed the Russian Orthodox Church again and, under the supervision and direction of the Orthodox Church Affairs Committee specially set up by the government, officially became a tool of communism. The Moscow Patriarchate was restored, and with the support of the government, Orthodox Church seminaries were established. The anti-religious sentiment of the early communist era was eliminated; what replaced it was the unity of communism and the Russian Orthodox Church.

Originally, since the founding of the Christian Church, its center has been in Rome. After the invasion of Rome by foreign tribes, the Roman Church not only did not decline but became even more prosperous. Throughout the long so-called "Dark Ages" in Western Europe, only the Roman Church was a stable force. The Eastern migration of the Roman imperial family allowed the Roman Church to enter a purely religious realm of separation of church and state. The church in the East, on the other hand, could not always escape the constraints of politics; therefore, the so-called Orthodox Church in the East has always been manipulated by politics. Speaking of this "orthodoxy," this so-called "Orthodox," it is like this. In the Eastern Roman Empire, because the capital was in Byzantium, Constantinople became the "Second Rome," which was "Orthodox." After the Eastern Roman Empire was conquered by the Turks, the Russians claimed the "Orthodoxy," so Moscow had the title of "Third Rome." In fact, according to people who faithfully believe in Christianity, the "orthodoxy" of the "Orthodox" Church is not "Orthodox"—this is still in Rome. Today, the Roman Catholic Church has more than 400 million believers, which shows where the Church's so-called "Holy See" is located. Because of this, the "Third Rome" Moscow believes that Rome is still its ultimate enemy.

The Pope of Rome is a spiritual leader of Catholic believers all over the world who does not possess military force. The news of an attempted assassination by a Yugoslav girl this time is indeed a bit abrupt. Now that there has been no official statement on this report, it remains to be verified. As for the execution of the Archbishop in Yugoslavia, there may be political relations involved. With the expansion of communist forces, we can see the struggle between the "Third Rome" and Rome everywhere. One of the most important factors determining the future destiny of mankind may be the outcome of this struggle!

### The Overseas Chinese Affairs Budget Is Pitifully Small!

The British proudly say, "The sun never sets on the British Empire"; we can also raise our thumbs and say, "Wherever there is seawater, there are Chinese." Originally, we have a popular saying in southern China, "Min and Yue have no land, the sea is their land," no wonder 12 million Overseas Chinese are scattered all over the world, especially in Southeast Asia, which has almost become "the Republic of China overseas." However, our Overseas Chinese compatriots are treated as cattle and horses by the whites, and as "undesirable elements" by their own country. Therefore, the Japanese colonial expert Masayoshi Naganari said to the Overseas Chinese, "A weak nation with strong people," which deeply implies a lot of emotion!

Regarding Overseas Chinese as "undesirable elements" was said by the ignorant rulers of the Qing Dynasty, but even in this ignorant dynasty, overseas inquiry bureaus were established in Guangzhou, Xiamen, Tianjin, and Ningbo, which was more than fifty years before the founding of the Republic of China, in the ninth year of Xianfeng. The inept Beijing government also set up the Overseas Workers Affairs Bureau in the State Council in the seventh year of the Republic of China and renamed it the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau in the eleventh year. Today's Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission is the seventh change in history! This is in accordance with the national father’s policy of protecting Overseas Chinese, and was reorganized and established in the twenty-first year under the direct administration of the Executive Yuan after a resolution by the Central Political Conference. Its existence is a matter of course, and its life span is no longer than that. Moreover, the head has never moved, which is thanks to the chairman’s wisdom and the effectiveness of the head.

In the autumn of the twenty-first year, when the association was established, it was a time of national difficulty. They received only 8,000 yuan per month for regular expenses, less than four-tenths of the original budget. The staff only received the minimum living expenses, which was called "national crisis salary" at the time. In June of the twenty-second year, the association’s funding increased to 18,000 yuan, in the twenty-third year it increased to 23,000 yuan, and in the twenty-sixth year it reached 280,000 yuan. During the Anti-Japanese War, all funding was reduced by 30%. In the twenty-eighth year, prices soared in the rear. Only then was the original budget restored. In the thirty-third year, the total cost of each fee was 16 million.

The original budget for this year was approximately 136 million yuan for regular expenses and living subsidies, and 5 million yuan for professional expenses. The ratio of business expenses to regular expenses is approximately 3%. The adjusted budget for regular expenses and living subsidies is approximately 1.3 billion yuan, and business expenses remain the same as before, and its percentage drops to 0.26%.

Their affiliated agencies, such as the Shanghai and Yunnan Overseas Chinese Affairs Offices, received only 290,000 yuan each for the entire year. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Offices in Fujian and Guangdong received 185,000 yuan, and each of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureaus received only 130,000 yuan per year. Some bureaus only received 7,000 old coins per year. The Overseas Chinese News Agency received approximately 20,000 yuan per month, and other affiliated agencies received only tens of thousands of yuan. At most, it has been increased by four times after the adjustment. This small amount is not enough for one person, how can it become an agency to run a business?

Regarding the resumption of Overseas Chinese affairs, the association formulated measures for the preparation of Overseas Chinese affairs after the war three years ago. In the spring of the thirty-second year, it set up an agency and invited 45 representatives from relevant agencies to participate. It held more than a dozen general meetings and countless small meetings. Various plans were compiled into two special volumes, which can be said to be all-inclusive, and they were sent to the Central Design Bureau and the Executive Yuan several months before the victory last year. A part of the post-war reconstruction plan has been approved in August this year, but the reconstruction funds have not yet been settled, not to mention the settlement of foreign exchange. The broken families, schools, shops, and fields of Overseas Chinese compatriots have no funds for relief, and the teachers who were sent to die in foreign countries have no money for compensation. The people who were sent out alive are wandering in foreign countries and waiting to be fed, and the wartime salaries owed to them cannot be paid. What kind of system is this? Is it worthy of talking about competing with others? It should be known that the revolution was successfully carried out from overseas, and others are also copying old articles. Have we awakened?

We have inquired about the numbers of the Overseas Chinese affairs budget from all aspects, which is really unbelievable, but the ruthless iron-like facts are in front of us: the Overseas Chinese affairs budget is so pitifully small, and the Overseas Chinese affairs are so urgently needed to be done! At present, the business expenses are only 5 million, accounting for 0.26% of the association's total expenses. What kind of calculation is this? Are there many people handling Overseas Chinese affairs? Not necessarily. The staff of a major association of the central government is only 70. Sometimes there is a section chief but no section head, and sometimes there is a section member but no section chief. It is conceivable that the person in charge is repairing the house with vines. The Overseas Chinese affairs that the Kuomintang General Assembly resolution and the Chairman’s order to be handled were written off by the president’s secretary and others who did not know it. The power of the accountant is really too great!

National expenditures have progressed from the rulers’ personal whims to public expenditures to increase public welfare. The difference is that the former is based on people’s discretion, while the latter is based on expenditure for income. The effect of national expenditures is either productive or non-productive. Productive expenditures have beneficial effects on social economy or people’s welfare. Non-productive expenditures do not benefit the economic effects and are waste. The Overseas Chinese affairs budget is obviously a productive expenditure, and it is the most effective investment. Today’s investment of one penny can get ten or twenty pennies tomorrow, for example, awarding Overseas Chinese students to return to China for further study. The motherland gives him 4,500 yuan in scholarships, but the Overseas Chinese remittances he brings are more than this number?

The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission is a national agency and a part of the country. It is used to express the personality of the country. The national personality is expressed through the agency. The quality of the agency’s performance has many reasons, but whether the budget is properly allocated is a major reason. Now that an agency has been set up to handle Overseas Chinese affairs, and people have been employed, but only 5 million of business is being done. We believe that no matter how skilled you are, you can’t do anything big. Wouldn’t it be a pity to spend 30 million of regular expenses and living subsidies? Wouldn’t it have a big impact on the expression of national personality?

Frederic W. Taylor first created "scientific management", which has now formed "the science of management", the purpose is nothing more than to increase efficiency. We hope that the government will improve the budget review system, and not allow people who only see money and don’t understand things to control the power of life and death. The budget of tens of millions should be discussed carefully, and the budget of several thousand should not be too harsh! A month of mobilization costs hundreds of millions of dollars; a school with less than 100 students moved from Yunnan to Chongqing, and from Chongqing to Beijing, costing more than tens of millions of dollars. In this case, why should the country be stingy with some Overseas Chinese business expenses? Guan Zi said: "Gold and knife coins are the common tools of the people, so the good ones hold their common tools to control their fate, so the people's strength can be exhausted." I hope the authorities will think about it and think about it again!

### Grain Tax in Zhejiang Province's Deficient Areas Approved for Payment in Coarse Rice or Cash; Fishing Escort Decided to Form Fishermen's Self-Defense Force

[Report from our Newspaper in Hangzhou, 25th] Due to rice germination this autumn in Zhejiang Province, resulting in poor harvests, farmers are crying out in distress. Yesterday, the Provincial Government Committee resolved and approved that deficient areas be allowed to pay 72.2 catties of coarse rice per picul of rice husk or, if necessary, legal currency. At the same time, it was resolved to comply with the telegram from the Ministry of Food, and the field tax for the 35th year of the Republic of China in Zhejiang will be collected at a 50% discount, totaling 10.5 million yuan, with three dou of solid grain collected per yuan, totaling 3.15 million shi; one dou of borrowed grain, totaling 1.05 million shi; and 30% for public sale, 945,000 shi, for a total of more than 5 million shi. As for the field tax due in each county, it was resolved that the province would not centrally coordinate it. For business tax, 30% to 50% will be collected from Hangzhou City, Hangzhou County, Shaoxing, Yin County, Jiaxing, Hai’ning, Wuxing, Yongjia, Pinghu, Yuyao, Fenghua, Jiashan, Jinhua, Huangyan, Yang’an, Wenling, Pingyang and other counties for provincial coordination to subsidize poorer counties. The 14 counties of Sanmen Pan’an should be financially self-sufficient and will not be extracted from or subsidized.

[Report from our Newspaper in Hangzhou] Regarding the matters that should be reformed in Zhejiang Province's fishing industry, after Li Anzheng of the Construction Department convened representatives from the Fisheries Administration Bureau, the Aquatic Products Company, and relevant fishing industry personnel in Dinghai to hold a symposium, the proposed plan was submitted to Chairman Shen for separate decisions, and the province will actively promote its gradual implementation. The main contents of the plan are roughly as follows: (1) In terms of escort, due to the vast fishing area and the limited strength of the water police, it is difficult to provide complete protection. It has been decided to organize a fishermen's self-defense force, adopting a method of government supervision and private operation. The government is responsible for allocating team members and salaries, and the Fishermen's Association is responsible for handling it. (2) Negotiate with the Farmers Bank of China to increase the province's fishing loan quota to a minimum of 1 billion yuan. The Provincial Bank will establish a fishing loan department to implement low-interest loans. The Provincial Government will negotiate with the Ministry of Finance to allow the province to establish a fishing bank. Loan departments will be attached to fish markets. (3) The Fisheries Bureau will mobilize various places to organize fish markets. The Dinghai Cold Storage should be allocated funds for repair as soon as possible. The Shenjiamen Cold Storage should be quickly received and reorganized. The Ningbo Fish Market will initiate the organization of cooperative ice head factories by fishermen in various places to engage in improved fish product manufacturing to facilitate sales.

### Suzhou High Court Held Court Yesterday; Public Trial of Traitor Shen Jinghua; A Set of Evasive Arguments; Crimes Obscured

[Report from our Newspaper in Suzhou, 25th] The Suzhou High Court held its first joint trial of traitor Shen Jinghua on the 25th, and the situation was no less than the public trial of major traitors such as Chen Chu. Approximately 200 people were in court to listen, and the audience on the side of the High Court Road was even more crowded. At 1:00 PM, Judge Chu Changhong of the Criminal Court signed an arrest warrant and brought the traitor Shen out of the prison for questioning in the waiting room. The traitor Shen made wild statements, saying that his role as a puppet county magistrate was to seek welfare for the people in the occupied area, and that he had no soldiers under his command and could not harm the people, etc. Those who heard it could not help but laugh, and some sneered at him. At 2:45 PM, Judge Chu took his seat. The First Court first questioned Wang Shubao, who was also accused in the same case. He claimed that he did not know Shen Jinghua and was operating a department store in Kunshan and had not served as a secret agent for the enemy. After questioning for about 20 minutes, the court ordered him to be sent back to custody. Next, traitor Shen was brought into the court and first questioned about his experience of collaborating with the enemy. According to his confession, he served as the director of the Qingpu Jiading Public Security Bureau before the war and as the director of the First District of the Taihu Water Police during the war. When the National Army retreated to the west, he retreated to Dongshan to engage in guerrilla warfare. In November of the 29th year, he was arrested and surrendered to the puppets, and was appointed by Li Shiqun as a commissioner of the puppet Jiangsu Provincial Government, but he never reported to duty. Later, he was appointed as the county magistrate of Taicang, Wuxian, Jiading and other counties, and then officially took over the job. Judge Chu immediately questioned him why he took over the job: Traitor Shen answered shamelessly, claiming that he was acting on the orders of the central government, and refused to admit the puppet positions of Kunshan County Magistrate and Shanghai First District District Chief. He then denied the crimes of luring and killing patriot Yang Zhong, etc. After about 50 minutes of questioning, the court ordered him to be sent back to custody. During the trial, the photographers wanted to capture the expression on the face of the traitor Shen. The traitor Shen covered his face with the dossier and asked the court to stop it. After leaving the court, he covered his face with his left sleeve and walked quickly, escorted back to the prison. When passing through the court gate, he shouted loudly to the surrounding crowd that he was not a traitor, causing a burst of laughter. The ugly state of the traitor trying to cover up his crimes was completely exposed.

### Wuxing Stores Grain to Prevent Famine; County Council Holds Meeting

[Report from our Newspaper in Wuxing] County Magistrate Yuan, considering that it is now the autumn harvest, and the fields that have not been flooded are being harvested one after another, the price of rice will inevitably fall, and farmers will sell at low prices. Rice merchants from neighboring counties will inevitably come to the county to compete for purchases, which is very important for the people's food. Therefore, a civil food adjustment committee was specially formed. The county government negotiated with various banks to provide low-interest loans to grain merchants to purchase and store large quantities of grain, waiting for the time when the green and yellow are not connected next year to distribute them at the price to help the people's food.

[Report from our Newspaper in Wuxing] The Second Congress of the First Session of the Wuxing County Council was held for three days starting on the 20th.

(2) Organizing a civil food adjustment committee. (3) Strengthening health institutions and planning to establish public hospitals. (4) Merging the townships and towns in this county. (5) The flood in this county is very serious, requesting the reduction and exemption of the field tax for this year to relieve the people's difficulties. (6) Really build dikes and embankments and dredge rivers to benefit farmland and facilitate transportation.

### Building a New Village by the Lakeside

Hangzhou Youth League Initiates Project to Help Solve Housing Shortage

[Our Hangzhou Correspondent] The First Branch of the Hangzhou Youth League, in order to solve the housing problems of ordinary citizens and public school employees, has initiated the formation of the Hangzhou Youth Housing Cooperative. It is preparing to build a "Youth New Village" on vacant land such as the City Government foundation in front of Wang Temple on the Broken Bridge to Autumn Moon in the West Lake and Huansha Road line.

[Our Suzhou Correspondent] Sun Xun, a major traitor who once served as the Major General Director of the puppet Political Security Bureau Jiangsu Provincial Branch and other positions, surrendered himself to the Suzhou High Prosecutors Office the day before yesterday. After Prosecutor Zhang interrogated him, he was temporarily released on bail with guarantees from two substantial shops, pending further summons. During the Anti-Japanese War, Sun was a notorious running dog of the enemy in the occupied areas. While serving as the Chief of the Intelligence Section of the Puppet Jiangsu Provincial Experimental District and the Chief of the Investigation Office of the Puppet Tax Investigation Department, he specialized in gathering information on our Central military and political affairs, providing it to the enemy and puppets, and undermining our anti-Japanese work. When he served as the Chief of the Suzhou Branch of the Puppet Food Bureau, he controlled civilian food supplies in order to achieve the enemy's cunning plan of using war to support war. He also served as the Director and Education Chief of the Puppet Wuxi Rural Pacification Cadre Training Center, creating enemy and puppet henchmen and acting as an accomplice. Finally, while serving as the Director of the Puppet Political Security Bureau Jiangsu Provincial Branch, he extensively collected information on our side, arrested our underground workers, and murdered patriotic fighters in order to destroy our anti-Japanese vitality and curry favor with the enemy. He also used despicable means to detain innocent people, extort and blackmail them, and exhaust all his plundering abilities, with countless victims. After the victory, he was once detained by a certain military organization stationed in Suzhou. Due to careless supervision, he took advantage of the opportunity to escape from prison. He was recaptured by a certain security agency in mid-March of this year. Because the traitor was despicable and shameless and begged for mercy, he was released on bail again and fled without a trace. An arrest warrant was issued, and the guarantors were detained for two months. Recently, the traitor, seeing that detectives were everywhere, had no choice but to surrender himself to the Suzhou High Prosecutors Office, hoping to mitigate his punishment. However, the local Association of Comrades in Distress believes that the traitor's crimes are heinous, and many comrades in distress have suffered from his actions. Even the death penalty would not be excessive. They are currently collecting evidence of the traitor's crimes and will list his crimes in detail within a few days in order to send a letter to the judicial authorities requesting strict punishment according to the law.

### Hangzhou City Government Expands Organization

It is heard that the Municipal Government will refer to the proposal previously approved by the Provincial Government and redraft it.

### Quantity Short and Quality Changed: Confiscated Opium Reveals Corruption

[Our Jiaxing Correspondent] The County Health Institute held a meeting yesterday to identify the composition of opium. The examination revealed that the seventeen taels of opium in the Fang Xiuzhen and Fang Xiuying's case of helping to sell opium, which was transferred by the Central District Police Precinct on March 17 to the County Military Law Office, has been reduced to fourteen and a half taels. Among them, eight taels contained more than 30% opium content, while six and a half taels contained no opium content at all, resembling sugar. There is suspicion of substitution. In addition, fifteen packs in the fifteen cases of Qian San et al. weighed one tael including the paper after examination. Three-tenths of the weight was opium. The identified opium was sealed and stamped by representatives of various legal entities present. Subsequently, Councilor Wang urgently proposed this peculiar incident at the council meeting, which shocked the audience. Councilors Ding Ningping, Wang Wenshen, Wu Dixiang, and Zheng Zhixia were immediately appointed to go to the Military Law Office to investigate the truth. Trial Officer Shen Xiaoda attended the meeting to report the process. The case was handled by former military judge Zhou Fengqi. He arrived at his post on May 2nd, and the handover was only in writing. The opium was stored in the General Affairs Office. Now the director of the General Affairs Office has left his post. Legally speaking, the police station, the General Affairs Office, the clerk, and the former military judge are all related. Finally, the council meeting advocated that the government should handle the case.

[Our Changshu Correspondent] The suppression work in Changyinsha District is progressing smoothly.

### Chaoxian Coal Mine Forcibly Occupied; Investigation Team Sends Personnel to Thoroughly Investigate Mine

[Our Wuhu Correspondent, 25th] After the Chaoxian Coal Mine was taken over by the former Tenth War Zone, it was operated by the receivers, who mined coal for profit and refused to hand it over. Ma Jingdang of the investigation team has now consulted with Zhang Weilian, special commissioner of the Wuhu district, and the Third Security Regiment to send personnel to the mine today for a thorough investigation.

[Our Wuhu Correspondent] The Third Group of the investigation team has started work in Wuhu and is still in the investigation stage. Because the materials in the custody of the responsible persons of various agencies have not been handed over in accordance with the law, the group specifically notified them to submit the facts and the amount of losses as soon as possible, otherwise, the original sealers will be detained and fined. Also, at the beginning of the recovery, someone learned that there were a large number of deposited ornaments in the Catholic Church in the city. The ornaments were forcibly searched and taken away. Father Goegebeur recently sent a letter to the investigation team, stating that the receiving agencies used the excuse that there were traitors such as Cai Bingmei inside, so they moved all the miscellaneous items deposited in the church together with those not owned by traitors, and said, "The things of traitors are not to be collected, and the things that are not traitors are also traitors when they are put together." A large gold bar, two small gold bricks, and 167 silver dollars belonging to Goegebeur were taken away. Three gold rings belonging to Li Hai. 500,000 yuan in legal tender. Two gold rings belonging to Teacher Jiang of the Catholic Church Primary School. A gold necklace and ten gold rings belonging to Zheng Deshun. Four gold bracelets, a gold anklet, a gold chain, seven gold rings, and two small gold coins belonging to Zheng Yufa.

The city party headquarters also notified the citizens to report any clues.

### Increasing Production of Wanxi Green Tea; Organizing Abandoned Gardens and Inferior Trees

[Our Hefei Correspondent] Wanxi green tea, which is famous at home and abroad, is produced in the three counties of Liu'an, Huoshan, and Lihuang in Anhui Province. It is called Xishan tea, which is excellent in color, taste, and aroma, with Subu Qitou Mountain being the best. The tea produced in the four counties of Shucheng, Lujiang, Yuexi, and Taihu is called Nanshan tea, which is second best. Before the sixth year of the Republic of China, the above seven counties produced 300,000 to 400,000 dan of tea annually. Later, Xishan was occupied by the Communist army, and during the war, it was blockaded by the Japanese invaders. There was no way to sell the tea, and the price plummeted. Tea gardens were abandoned, and the mountains were full of them. Although the Huoshan Tea Improvement Factory of the Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry tried its best to guide and support the development, and the Tea Lending and Marketing Office purchased and sold tea every year, the production last year was less than 40,000 dan. Now, in order to relieve tea farmers and increase production, the Relief Administration has decided to reorganize the tea gardens in the above seven counties. According to statistics, there are currently 320,000 mu of tea gardens, with a total of 64 million tea trees and 600,000 tea farmers. Therefore, a four-year plan has been formulated to remove weeds and open up abandoned tea gardens, and to prune or transplant existing tea trees, to be completed in four years. This winter, 16 million tea trees will be reorganized first. It is estimated that the tea production can be increased by 30,000 dan next spring.

### Qidong Intercepts Materials; Returns or Confiscates Them Separately

[Our Nanbao Correspondent] Regarding the suspicious materials intercepted by the various units in the first (September 28th) and second (October 8th) surprise raids at various ports in this county, the materials included an astonishing amount of floral cloth, broad beans, white paper, collar hooks, military uniform buttons, alcohol, pigs, sheep, sugar, and cigarettes. In order to thoroughly investigate, the county government dispatched Police Officer Liu Fucheng to cooperate with the county party headquarters and the district heads of the first to fifth districts to be responsible for the handling. After several days of separate investigations and summoning the owners of the materials one by one, the results have been obtained. All the materials belonging to legitimate merchants will be returned to the owners who come to claim them with proof of ownership. If the owners have gone elsewhere and no one comes to claim them, they will be temporarily sealed up in the county government and kept for future investigation and return. As for those that are found to be smuggled goods after investigation, they will be confiscated and reported to higher authorities for disposal by the county government.

### Wuxing Urban Land Prices Divided into Ten Grades

Prevent Fires, Please Remove Board Houses

We live in Lane 302, near Haifang Road and Jiangning Road in western Shanghai. There are more than eight lanes in total, with nearly a thousand households. During the Shanghai War in 1937, residents of Zhabei fled to the concessions. At that time, the lanes were occupied by refugees. Because of traffic congestion, in order to facilitate the management of the lanes, temporary permission was given to build board houses in the back lanes. For eight years, the number of houses and people in that area has increased. The lane connects Haifang Sea in the front and Jiangning Road and Anyuan Road in the back. Therefore, the lane is blocked, forming a situation where water cannot flow through. Because Lanes 153 and the Western Lane experienced fires on the 5th and 8th of last month, residents fled with their belongings, but there was no way to escape. They were all screaming and crying. Fortunately, the fires were extinguished quickly, preventing a disaster. Otherwise, it would have been unimaginable! Moreover, as the weather is approaching late autumn and winter, and the weather is dry, in order to prevent disasters, we respectfully request the authorities to move or demolish the board houses to ensure the safety of the citizens in the lanes. We are praying for your urgent attention. (From all the lane heads)

Yangzhou Hospital Clarifies Clinic Services

Regarding Mr. Hu Fenghao's criticism of the clinic services of Jiangsu Provincial Yangzhou Hospital, the hospital sent a letter stating: "Since this hospital was ordered to prepare for establishment in June of this year, it has always considered that there were many refugees in Yangzhou and that epidemics were expected during the summer. Therefore, it started outpatient services on July 11, providing free medical treatment specifically for refugees. Since the opening of the clinic until now, 22,000 refugees have been treated, and all have medical records. During this time, there were many refugees who required surgery, but the hospital was newly established and had a limited number of doctors. Therefore, it was changed to provide medical treatment for refugees on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday afternoons and surgery for refugees on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday afternoons, temporarily suspending outpatient services. However, after a doctor's diagnosis, those who were deemed to require daily treatment could still come for daily treatment without interruption. As for refugees with mild symptoms, although they were treated every other day, they were also given enough medicine to last for two days. Since the implementation, refugees with illnesses have not felt any inconvenience. Recently, as the number of serious illnesses requiring surgery has gradually decreased, the hospital resumed the time for providing medical treatment specifically for refugees every afternoon starting on October 1st. How could this hospital be acting contrary to government orders? I am deeply afraid that the outside world will not know the facts and will be confused. Therefore, I dare not remain silent and ask that you publish this to clarify the truth."

There Are No Streetlights on the Side of the Stinking Stream

In Jinjia Lane at the end of Xinzha Road, there is a stinking stream. During the summer, the stream water emits a foul odor under the sun, and passersby hold their breath. Now that the weather has cooled down, it is very inconvenient for passersby because there are no streetlights. It is common for pedestrians and rickshaws to accidentally fall into the stream at night. In addition to pedestrians being more cautious, please pay attention to the Public Works Bureau to find a way to install one or two streetlights. (Fang Jinchang)

The Location of the "Central Education District"

Recently, I read in the newspaper that the Municipal Education Bureau plans to establish secondary education districts in the four suburbs of the city and will first establish the West Suburban Secondary Education District at Hongqiao Airport, which I found very exciting. However, Hongqiao Airport was the first airport built in the city and was the location of the "August 13th" Anti-Japanese War. It seems necessary to preserve it as a memorial. As for public land for building schools in western Shanghai, the citizens of this city should not forget the "Zhongzheng Camp," the location where college and high school students in this city concentrated for military training before the war. The land is located west of Huacao Town on the North Dike Road. At that time, more than 360 mu of farmland were requisitioned. It is currently abandoned and has not been received and used by the government. I am writing this letter to urge the attention of the educational administrative authorities.

Road Names and House Numbers are Being Corrected

I read the article "Properly Determine Road Names and House Numbers in the City" in the Reader Opinions column of your newspaper on October 22. The regulations on road names and the installation of road signs are the responsibility of the Public Works Bureau. This bureau is responsible for organizing house numbers, which is being carried out in accordance with the "Shanghai Municipal Regulations on Organizing House Numbers" passed by the 25th Municipal Government Meeting. The preliminary investigation has been completed. We are now renovating inverted door numbers, pasting temporary door number lane numbers, and supplementing new signs. The irrational phenomena of having two colors of door number plates on one road and other unreasonable phenomena will soon be corrected. We respectfully request that you publish this information to inform the public. (Shanghai Municipal Police Department)

### Various Small Nations Challenge the Soviet Union: Unanimously Oppose the Veto Power; U.S. Advocates Free Discussion of All Issues; Eight Assistant Secretaries-General Were Sworn in Yesterday

[Our Report] San Francisco, 25th Broadcast: The Soviet delegation attending the United Nations General Assembly attempted to prevent the General Assembly from discussing the veto power of the five permanent members of the Security Council. However, due to the firm opposition of the United States, their efforts are bound to fail. The General Committee, composed of representatives from fourteen countries, will discuss the agenda. Currently, there are fifty-three items tentatively scheduled, three of which relate to the veto power. Australia proposes limiting the veto power of the five permanent members, while Cuba has put forward two proposals advocating the complete abolition of the veto power clause in the Charter. Soviet representative Vyshinsky insisted that the veto power issue should not be discussed, while the United States believes that any issue should have the right to be fully discussed in the General Assembly. With both sides unwilling to concede, a heated debate is inevitable. However, the Soviet Union's position has little hope of being fully accepted.

[Reuters, Lake Success, New York, 25th] After a heated debate last night regarding the treatment of Indians in South Africa, the General Committee of the General Assembly has only two remaining proposals on the provisional agenda that are likely to cause heated debate: Cuba's motion to abolish the veto power and Australia's motion to amend the entire Charter. These two matters will be discussed at this afternoon's meeting. At the same time, the Plenary Session is also scheduled to continue the general debate this afternoon. Last night, during the debate on the South Africa-India issue, Soviet representative Vyshinsky and Ukrainian representative Manuilsky supported the Indian representative and opposed South African Prime Minister Smuts' proposal to withdraw the "Treatment of Indians in the Union of South Africa" issue from the provisional agenda. The committee finally recommended that the General Assembly refer the matter to the Legal and Political Committees for discussion. The United Kingdom and the United States are expected to oppose the Soviet Union's proposal to withdraw the item on the agenda discussing the veto power of the five permanent members. The U.S. representative will also oppose the Soviet Union's proposal to withdraw the discussion of South Africa's annexation of Southwest Africa. If the General Committee refuses to accept Cuba's proposal to convene a special committee to discuss the abolition of the veto power, the Cuban delegation may withdraw from the United Nations.

[Comprehensive News] The United Nations General Assembly held its first meeting on the evening of the 24th. After Secretary-General Lie reported on the work of the secretariat, the chief representative of Brazil, Najera, launched a general debate, requesting the abolition or modification of the veto power of the five permanent members of the Security Council, arguing that the veto power hinders the unity of the United Nations. Representatives from the Philippines and Cuba also declared their opposition to the veto power. Cuban representative Freyre issued a final challenge to the Soviet Union today. Mr. Freyre put forward two proposals requesting the revision of the United Nations Charter to abolish the veto power of the five permanent members, hoping to include this proposal on the agenda. Mr. Freyre also declared to reporters that democratic countries constitute a majority in the United Nations General Assembly, and if we cannot freely express our opinions and freely discuss matters, what is the use of the General Assembly? Brazilian representative Velloso also fiercely opposed the abuse of the veto power in the Security Council. It is said that "If it is said that sacrificing the welfare of mankind is legitimate when the interests of great powers conflict, the whole world will never think that way. The reason why the countries at the San Francisco Conference agreed to grant the four powers the veto power was because they were single-mindedly focused on maintaining peace, and thus granted certain privileges to the major powers, but these countries must not lose faith in order to do so." The Peruvian representative echoed the Brazilian proposal, stating that if the veto power is abused, it will inevitably revert to the Middle Ages, and most countries will have no opportunity to seek justice. The Belgian representative, Langehove, stated that the mission of the Security Council is to maintain peace, but the Council has not yet studied issues that could endanger peace. I also believe that all the failures of the Security Council are due to the abuse of the veto power by a certain permanent member. The Soviet Union remained silent in the face of the initial barrage of criticism, but its attitude was very firm.

[Central News Agency, New York, 24th Special Dispatch] The Second Plenary Session of the United Nations General Assembly was held this morning, and eight Assistant Secretaries-General were officially sworn in. At the request of the President of the General Assembly, Spaak, Wellington Koo took a seat on the high platform adorned with the famous world map. Subsequently, Secretary-General Lie introduced the following eight Assistant Secretaries-General: Soviet representative Sobolev, responsible for the work of the Security Council; British representative Owen, responsible for economic work; French representative Laugier, responsible for social work; Chinese representative Hu Shih-tse, responsible for trusteeship work; Chilean representative Cohen, responsible for information work; Czech representative Kerno, responsible for legal work; Dutch representative Feller, responsible for conference and general services; and U.S. representative Hassen, responsible for administrative and financial affairs. Each person read a brief statement pledging allegiance to the work of the United Nations, stating, "In the performance of my duties, I will not seek or accept instructions from any government or any source external to the United Nations." Hu Shih-tse used Chinese when taking the oath.

### Secretary-General Reports on Secretariat Affairs: Requests Action Against Franco; Spanish Embassy in the United States Denounces as Unreasonable Slander

[Reuters, Lake Success, New York, 24th] The United Nations General Assembly convened at 4:15 PM today. The agenda for today included the appointment of eight Assistant Secretaries-General, the presentation of credentials by the representatives, the report of the election of the chairmen of the three committees, the acceptance of Secretary-General Lie's report, and then the commencement of the general debate. Lie's report stated: I cannot but urge the General Assembly to pay attention to the issue of the new regime in Spain. The Security Council should also study this issue in detail, some of which involve matters that have been discussed by the Economic and Social Council. Other organizations within the United Nations system may also be affected by the Spanish issue. After the defeat of Germany and Japan, the fact that fascist forces still hold control in Spain is truly unpleasant. The continued existence of the Franco regime will be a cause of misunderstanding among the countries that founded the United Nations. Therefore, I hope that those who once brought us victory and peace can also find ways to restore freedom and democratic government to Spain. Lie then described the progress of the work of the Atomic Energy Commission, stating that this progress is extremely limited and slow. Until this major issue is resolved, the world cannot sleep peacefully. This is the responsibility of the United Nations system. Regarding the status of the United Nations system in international law, Lie stated that the Nuremberg trials have created a precedent. For the sake of protecting peace and humanity, the principles that can be used in the Nuremberg trials should be made permanent provisions in international law as soon as possible. Lie continued to say that since the end of the war, the United Nations has been divided in opinion due to peace. The United Nations Charter is based on a proper peace and the firm agreement of the powers. The conclusion of peace treaties can provide the United Nations system with a solid working foundation and eliminate many confusing opinions that hinder the progress of work, allowing it to focus on ensuring a stable peace and promoting the welfare of the people. If we cannot understand this great ultimate goal, the whole world will not forgive us. Lie also reiterated the issue of human rights, stating that the protection of human rights is stipulated in the Charter. Unfortunately, many countries, even the most progressive ones, cannot ensure that all their people have basic human rights. Therefore, we must not stop striving until women in all parts of the world can enjoy the same rights as men. The General Assembly decided to use Lie's report, the report to be submitted by the Security Council, and the report of the Economic and Social Council as the basis for the general debate.

[United Press, Washington, 25th] The Spanish Embassy in the United States issued a statement today stating: "Lie's report is quite astonishing. We feel that there will come a day" when the secret of Lie's attitude will be known, and we believe that there is indeed such a secret. Otherwise, Lie, having no knowledge of Spain and having no connection with the so-called "Spanish issue," would not dare to make such unreasonable slander. ...If the Secretary-General of the United Nations attempts to spread a thick smokescreen for the special interests of some of his friends, ...we believe that this move will not succeed.

### India Accuses South Africa: May Be Included on the Agenda of the General Assembly

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 24th] When the General Committee of the United Nations General Assembly reviewed the agenda of the General Assembly yesterday, it sparked a debate over whether to include the issue of the abuse of Indian minorities within the Union of South Africa on the agenda. The head of the South African delegation, namely the country's Prime Minister Smuts, believed that this matter was purely a domestic issue and should not be included on the agenda of the General Assembly. However, the President of the General Assembly, Spaak, declared that the General Committee has no right to remove any issue from the agenda, but the General Assembly has the right to decide on it. Soviet representative Vyshinsky, with the support of the majority of representatives, stated that the General Assembly should review this issue, and the South African motion was withdrawn. The chief representative of India, Mrs. Pandit, stated that when India is scheduled to speak during the general debate tomorrow, she will still express her views.

### Second Day of the General Assembly: Many Representatives Absent

### Atomic Materials: Control is Complex

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, New York, 24th] After this informal meeting, the giants of the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission unanimously agreed that the control of the atomic material thorium is more difficult than the control of uranium. Because thorium ore is widely distributed and mined on a smaller scale, it is not easy to control. In addition, thorium is often found in other minerals, making its control even more complex.

### Draft Trusteeship Agreements

Four Countries Submit to the United Nations

[Central News Agency, New York, 24th Special Dispatch] United Nations Secretary-General Lie announced that the Belgian government has agreed to place Ruanda-Urundi in eastern Central Africa, formerly under Belgian mandate by the League of Nations, under the United Nations Trusteeship System. Four countries have already submitted draft trusteeship agreements to the United Nations, which can be predicted to lead to the early establishment of the Trusteeship Council.

### Churchill Responds to Attlee: Sternly Condemns the Communist Party; Says It is Enough to Destroy Good Social Systems

[Reuters, Luton, England, 24th] Churchill delivered a speech here tonight, responding to Prime Minister Attlee's address at the Trades Union Congress attacking British Communism. Churchill said that the British government's break with the Communist Party has important and beneficial results for foreign countries, because some countries in Europe, such as France, are now struggling under the attack of Communism. This position of the British government can promote the stability of Europe and serve as a model for many countries. Churchill then reiterated the serious warning he issued in the House of Commons yesterday, stating that he had given serious consideration to the question of whether there were more than two hundred divisions of Soviet troops stationed throughout Europe before raising it. The facts that can be revealed have evidence to prove their correctness. Churchill also said that the words used by Stalin a few months ago to scold Churchill were commonly used by Hitler or Goebbels. Churchill continued to say that the British Communist Party is currently not enough to become a major political target, so it is still not worthy of national attention. However, communist ideas in France are growing terribly. The revival of French life has been threatened by it. Under any communist government, the communist system is a totalitarian system, enough to destroy freedom and a good social system. Greece, after fair and free citizen elections, has jumped out of the danger of the communist Balkan bloc. After criticizing the government's domestic policies, Churchill said that Attlee's ability to use such language to condemn communist propaganda is in line with my intentions. I feel that our country has not been affected by communist propaganda.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 25th] Former Prime Minister Churchill stated in the House of Commons yesterday that the Soviet Union has more than two hundred divisions of troops stationed in Europe. According to a cable from the "London Times" correspondent in Moscow, foreign military experts believe that the figures put forward by Churchill are exaggerated.

### British Trades Union Congress: Passes Resolution; Demands Severance of Relations with Spain

[Reuters, London, 25th] Prime Minister Attlee told the Trades Union Congress convened in Brighton that the British government has implemented democratic principles in India, Burma, Outer Jordan, and Ceylon, and that this policy of the government has been welcomed by the whole world.

The Prime Minister also said that one of the tragedies of the world situation is that the Soviet government seems to be deliberately preventing the Soviet people from interacting with the people of other countries, and Soviet newspapers also publish distorted views of other parts of the world, thus creating a gap of incomprehension and suspicion between countries. Today's Trades Union Congress passed a resolution by a majority demanding that the British government sever all economic and diplomatic relations with the Franco government. At the same time, a resolution criticizing the British government's foreign policy towards Spain, Greece, Germany, and the Soviet Union was rejected.

### Pravda Criticizes: Soviet Communist Party; Neglects Democratic Principles

[Reuters, Moscow, 25th] Pravda criticized today that the Soviet Communist Party seriously neglects democratic principles. It is said that it is appropriate to limit public discussion of issues or frequent workers' meetings during wartime. Unfortunately, these methods have continued to exist after the war. For example, the party committees in factories have long neglected to solicit the opinions of party members. The newspaper revealed that the comprehensive communist activities within the Soviet army will be restored, and elections are currently being held for the party organizations in the army.

### Explaining the Reasons for the Quarrel between the U.S. and Philippine Military and Civilians: MacArthur Issued a Statement Yesterday; Philippine Newspapers Criticize the Behavior of the U.S. Military

[Remodeling Society, Tokyo, 25th] MacArthur issued a statement today on the current situation in the Philippines, stating: Since the independence of the Philippines in June, the commander of the U.S. forces in the Philippines reported that the solid camaraderie that existed during the U.S.-Philippine war has declined. The irresponsibility of some new U.S. soldiers, commercial plundering, the recovery of war disasters, the rights of demobilized soldiers, and relief issues are some of the reasons for this sentiment. However, the root cause is even deeper. Most Filipinos, even if they have friendly intentions, feel uneasy about foreign troops stationed in their capital, Manila, and as a result, the situation has become enormous. MacArthur also answered a question about "What is the morale of the U.S. forces stationed in Japan?": The Japanese occupation forces under my direct command are understaffed and lack combat training. However, apart from natural homesickness, the morale and discipline can be said to be excellent. I can no longer ask for anything more.

[United Press, Manila, 25th] After U.S. Army Chief of Staff Eisenhower ordered an investigation into the discipline of U.S. troops in the Philippines, Philippine newspapers criticized the behavior of the U.S. military. The Manila Post stated: The U.S. Army is said to have hindered the Philippine reconstruction plan, and the U.S. military's continued occupation of public property also damages Philippine sovereignty. The Chronicle commented on the general situation and the East Indies, believing that the Philippines is not truly independent, saying that the Philippines, as the leader of the one billion colonized people in Asia, is now greatly disappointed.

[United Press, Washington, 24th] Thousands of new Army manuals were shipped to Manila after a three-month delay to promote goodwill between the U.S. military and the local population.

[United Press, Washington, 25th] President Truman mentioned to reporters today that the United States could reduce restrictions on immigration to allow some European political refugees to obtain assistance in America. Currently, only Congress can amend immigration quotas.

Congress is expected to amend the current immigration laws when it convenes in January next year.

### Director of the Bureau of Conscription Holds Press Conference in Nanjing: Confirms Delay in Implementation of Conscription in Shanghai, States that This Conscription is Only to Fill Vacancies; Cultural and Technical Workers May Be Temporarily Exempt from Call-Up

[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 25th] When answering questions from reporters on the 25th, Xu Siping, Director of the Bureau of Conscription, confirmed that the implementation of conscription in Shanghai will be postponed. He also stated that technical and cultural workers may be temporarily exempt from call-up, and shop managers, etc., will not be used as ordinary soldiers when they enlist in the future. Instead, they will be assigned to work in military logistics, so that their own expertise will not be completely buried. It is said that the authorities are treating the implementation of conscription in Shanghai, Nanjing, and Chongqing very seriously. Because the population in these three cities is relatively large, the implementation will naturally be more difficult than in other places. Therefore, conscription is specifically delayed. At the same time, the personnel institutions, laws, and investigations related to conscription in the above locations are also being handled with special care, and the household registration survey work is limited to being completed within this year. In terms of the principle of the Conscription Law: conscription is universal. However, the current call-up is only to fill vacancies. Its purpose is only to supplement the vacancies of a small number of discharged or infirm soldiers in the military. It is only a call-up of "soldiers" and not a call-up of "officers," nor a supplement of military technical personnel. The date of the nationwide implementation of conscription has not been determined. The number of conscripts will be very small, even less than one-tenth or one-twentieth of that during wartime. The authorities attach great importance to the selection of the commander of the Shanghai and Nanjing-Chongqing Garrison Districts, and it is currently difficult to find a suitable candidate. Another senior conscription official also said that the Conscription Law is only a basic law, and more than 20 other laws related to conscription have not yet been drafted and promulgated, so the real implementation of conscription may have to wait. The authorities are considering the Shanghai municipal government's request to deliberate on delaying conscription in the area. Director Xu gave a detailed explanation of the characteristics of the new Conscription Law at the press conference today, and explained that this resumption of conscription is peacetime, not wartime. It is said that the target of conscription under the previous Conscription Law was "soldiers" and did not mention "officers." At the same time, due to limited national funding and poor soldier treatment, the general public tried to evade military service, resulting in various malpractices. The new Conscription Law adds military officers, military sergeants, and army, navy, and air force soldiers, expanding the scope of conscription. The state determines the needs of the people based on their quality. Those who study medicine can serve as medical officers, and those who study engineering can serve in bridge construction and road repair, so that talents are put to good use. At the same time, the scope of postponement of conscription has also been reduced compared to the past (previously there were more than 110 types), so that the obligation to serve is equally and universally applicable.

### Police and Bandits Clash Fiercely at the Intersection of Route Foch and Route Cardinal Mercier: All Five Robbers Captured, One Commits Suicide Out of Fear of Punishment

[Our Correspondent] Last night at 8:30, the Grand China Leather Shoe Store at 380 Route Foch and Route Cardinal Mercier had already closed when five violent bandits suddenly forced their way in, brandishing firearms and threatening the store staff. Two bandits went upstairs first and confined the tenants and the store owner's wife in one room. Then, they entered the bedroom of the store owner Zhou Dengrong's mother in the back room and forcibly snatched the gold ring from Zhou's mother's hand. At this time, passersby had noticed and urgently reported to the nearby New Town Police Station.

Director Zhuo Qingbao of the police station, accompanied by Criminal Section Chief Song Bingzheng, personally led 70-80 armed officers, divided into two police vehicles, to the scene. Because the pedestrians there were crowded and there were many people in the room, fearing that it would be difficult to distinguish right from wrong and harm the innocent, Director Zhuo ordered the officers to form a fan shape and surround the area. Section Chief Song first led the police to bravely rush in. At this time, the bandits in the room knew that they had been exposed. In order to preemptively strike, they fired dozens of shots in succession. The police immediately returned fire. One bandit, Shi Tingshan (29 years old, from Shaoxing), tried to break out of the encirclement and was captured first. The other two bandits downstairs engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the police and were eventually knocked down. These two bandits, named Chen Miaofu (20 years old, from Nantong) and Song Zhiyuan (21 years old, from Hangzhou), were also captured. At that time, the bandit Sheng Yipin (20 years old, from Shandong) upstairs was at a loss and was also arrested. Another accomplice, Zhang, committed suicide out of fear of punishment, shooting himself in the throat. He was still breathing weakly and was sent to the police hospital for treatment.

The police and bandits held each other for four hours. At that time, the Municipal Police Bureau, upon receiving the report, also dispatched a large number of officers to the scene. At the same time, the Route Massenet Gendarmerie and the Investigation Division of the Garrison Command also dispatched personnel to assist. When bullets were flying, a pedestrian, Xu Wenhui (resident of 370 on the same road), was hit in the right cheek by a stray bullet, and another person, Zhang Heqing (resident of 372 nearby), was shot in the left arm. They were sent to Hongren Hospital for treatment.

### Municipal Council Finance Committee Discusses Entertainment Donation Tax Yesterday

Budget Committee Meeting Adjourned

[Our Correspondent] The Finance Committee of the Municipal Council held a special meeting at the council's address yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM. Ten committee members attended, and Speaker Pan Gongzhan also attended. Councilor Zhao Dihua served as chairman. Yesterday, the council specially discussed one motion, namely the approval of a letter from the Movie Theater Industry and Drama Industry Association, requesting that the Municipal Finance Bureau be informed to first deduct 20% of the current entertainment donation item for defense expenses, and then implement the increase of the entertainment donation rate by 11%. The resolution states that the intention of Item 1 of Resolution No. 16 of the Finance Department, which stated that the entertainment tax would restore the originally scheduled donation rate of 50%, did not state that it originally contained additional defense expenses. According to the principle of Resolution No. 1 of the Budget Department, the additional defense expenses will be abolished from the autumn of this year. The two industry associations' request to collect 41% of the entertainment tax is not without reason and should be requested by the Finance Bureau to refer to Resolution No. 16 of the Finance Department and Resolution No. 1 of the Budget Department of the first general meeting of the council, as well as the resolution of the second case of the 17th municipal administration meeting of the Municipal Government, for deliberation.

### Profits Tax: Standards and Methods Determined; Tax Collection Will Be Based on Three Principles

It is heard that the standards and methods for paying profits tax in the city have been determined.

Those who do not report on time in accordance with the law, or who report late, or whose reports are untrue, or who attempt to evade taxes, will be sent to audit their accounts, and the decision will be made directly according to the highest standards of each industry, or transferred to the court for strict punishment.

### China Merchants Bureau Takes Over Jing'an Steamer

[Our Correspondent] The China Merchants Bureau yesterday took over the Jing'an Steamer transferred by the Naval Department. The steamer was originally the enemy steamer Jianglong, which was renamed Jing'an Ship after being taken over by the Naval Department after the victory. Because it was not suitable for military use, it was handed over to the China Merchants Bureau for commercial use. After taking over, the bureau will rename it Jianglong.

In addition to Huo and Chen, participants included UNRRA Deputy Director Li Zhuomin, William Green, Director of the UNRRA Supply Department, and Willie Lea, General Chennault's assistant. The contract was divided into Chinese and English versions, and signed successively by Director Huo, Chennault, Willie Lea, and William Green. Thus, the UNRRA Civil Air Transport Team, which had suffered several setbacks, was officially established yesterday morning. After the signing ceremony, Director Huo and General Chennault shook hands happily, welcoming the Flying Tiger General, who had served China during the war, to join the UNRRA organization and serve the Chinese people again. Director Huo said to Chen: "I welcome you to join our big family." Chen told reporters that he was honored to be able to serve the Chinese people. The transport work of the air transport team will officially begin in mid-next month, with Guangzhou as the main transport station, distributing relief supplies to various parts of South China. The air transport team will consist of 12 transport aircraft supplied by the UNRRA, three of which will arrive in Shanghai recently. As soon as the three aircraft arrive, work will begin.

### Term of Work is the Same as the UNRRA; Profits and Losses are Solely the Responsibility of Chen

The summary of the contract is as follows: all 12 aircraft supplied by the UNRRA are C-46 and C-47 transport aircraft, purchased with funds raised by the UNRRA, with a total value of US$2 million. The UNRRA will also allocate US$1 million in foreign exchange as the salaries of the air transport team's staff and the cost of purchasing various fuels and supplies. In addition, Chennault and Willie Lea will jointly raise US$1 million to make up for the shortfall. Chen and Lea are fully responsible for the profits and losses of the air transport team. The work of the air transport team is stipulated to transport the UNRRA's relief supplies. The aircraft are absolutely prohibited from transporting goods and passengers when traveling between coastal cities or from coastal cities to the interior. The nature of the air transport team is exactly the same as that of the UNRRA's water transport team and land transport team. However, on the return trip from the interior to the coastal cities, if there is spare tonnage, government personnel may be transported. If there are still empty seats, passengers can also be carried, and the prices will be the same as those of the China Central Airlines. The term of work is equal to the term of work of the UNRRA. As soon as the UNRRA ends, the air transport team will also end. After the air transport team ends, all aircraft and equipment will belong to Chen and his assistants, but they must repay the funds for the aircraft and equipment on a monthly basis within 18 months. The air transport team will transport materials on behalf of the UNRRA at a cost of US$0.9 per ton (per mile). The area covered includes the seven major cities of Shanghai, Guangzhou, Nanchang, Hankou, Guilin, Hengyang, and Liuzhou. Other areas will be expanded as needed and as possible. All profits and losses are the sole responsibility of Chennault. Chen also discussed the application of airports and personnel issues in detail with Huo yesterday morning, and most of them have been resolved. The UNRRA is scheduled to end next autumn, and the work of the air transport team will also end at that time. After the work begins, all principles will be implemented in accordance with the provisions of the contract.

All members could not avoid it. Those with looms wove cloth, and those with spindles spun yarn. The quantity was determined according to the number of looms and spindles in each factory. The raw materials were supplied by them, and a small amount of wages was paid separately. The whole thing was compulsory, and no one actually wanted to do it.

In addition, the cases of Yang Qing, the puppet Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau's 6th Detective Squad Leader, a follower of Lu Ying, and Fang Guojin, a businessman accused of providing metal to the enemy, were both investigated and adjourned for further questioning.

### Thirteen People Arrested One After Another for Selling Narcotics Along the Road

[Our Newspaper] The case of Shi Yunfang abusing her adopted daughter Ge Lian was heard by the District Court on the 18th of this month. Although Shi Yunfang defended herself, claiming that Xu Jidun, the false director of the Economic Bureau in the left neighborhood, had falsely accused her out of spite, the District Court's investigation revealed that the false police bureau's children protection section and other departments did indeed have evidence of Shi Yunfang abusing Ge Lian. The verdict was announced yesterday, sentencing Shi Yunfang to three months' imprisonment with a two-year probation.

### Impersonating the Central Statistics Bureau to Swindle · Hoping Citizens Can Report at Any Time

Recently, unscrupulous individuals, using the name of the Central Statistics Bureau, extorted a large sum of money from a hospital. The case was later solved by the police bureau after the victim reported it. According to the person in charge of the Central Statistics Bureau in Shanghai, the bureau has no such staff, and it is obviously a case of criminals impersonating them. They also stated that they sincerely hope that citizens will report any such incidents in the future, and they are willing to coordinate with military and police agencies at any time. Once any situation of impersonation is discovered, they should be notified immediately so that they can jointly investigate and handle the matter.

### British Tramway Resumes Work · Negotiations Have Progressed · Three Inciters of the Strike Are at Large

The workers of the British Tramway Company resumed work entirely yesterday, and trams on all routes have resumed operation. Qiu Changjiang, the chairman of the workers' union, and others reported the resumption of work to the Social Affairs Bureau at 9:00 AM yesterday and requested that all the demands made by the workers be resolved quickly. At 3:00 PM, representatives from both labor and management went to the Social Affairs Bureau to negotiate. In an atmosphere of harmony, both parties exchanged views. After two hours, it was heard that the negotiations had progressed. Furthermore, four workers who obstructed the tram from leaving the factory and incited the strike the day before yesterday have clearly violated criminal laws. Mayor Wu has ordered their arrest. It is heard that one of them has already been apprehended, and the other three are at large. The police bureau is stepping up their arrest and will bring them to justice. In addition, rumors that Mayor Wu had advised the management to make concessions in the British Tramway workers' strike in order to facilitate a resolution have been denied by the municipal government.

### Irrational Compilation of Workers' Cost of Living Index · Various Trade Unions Request Improvement

On the 19th of this month, in response to the request of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the municipal government sent Zhou Shishu from the research office to the federation to explain the compilation process of the workers' cost of living index. Representatives of various trade unions, believing that there were many discrepancies with the current situation, made the following suggestions to the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions: (1) The current cost of living index is based on a household survey conducted during the enemy occupation in 1942, which is different from the current living standards. A new household survey should be conducted as a basis. (2) Before the household survey is completed, during the transitional period, the three types of staple foods in the food category, namely corn, wheat bran, and soybeans, are inconsistent with real life and should be removed. The current standard for white rice is inferior rice. In order to ensure nutritional quality, the food category should be improved and the names of the food items should be based on the living standards surveyed by the Social Affairs Bureau in 1929 to meet the needs of actual life. (3) The prices of the surveyed goods should be carefully noted in the market. (4) The index should add the necessary expenses for children's education, medical care, and miscellaneous expenses. (5) The weights of necessities should be increased and made public. (6) The publication time should be changed to once every half month. (7) A cost of living index compilation committee should be organized by relevant parties, adopting an open approach, or reorganizing the existing cost of living index application committee, with representatives from the industrial and commercial sectors participating to ensure fairness. It is heard that the above recommendations have been resolved by the council of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and submitted to the municipal government for improvement and publication within the possible scope.

### The Inside Story of Pickpocketing in Shanghai (6)

— Huang Jiamo

The "Running the Docks" gang spends its days wandering around the docks, with many eyes and ears. Some of the small employees on the ships often collude with these people in secret, actually sending secret codes in the guise of government spies, and can get a share after a successful extortion. This gang lives by this "toll line," and is naturally good at making connections and eating endlessly. Therefore, among the "old brothers" gangs, the "Running the Docks" gang should be the most promising, and its organization is the most strict and possesses a strong "spirit of self-government."

"Running the Garbage" - this gang is simply the scavengers under the "Running the Docks" gang. Those who engage in this are some of the more useless "bagasse" types. Those shops and businesses near the docks are all places they frequent. Mainly the seafood stores, fresh produce stores, fruit stores, food stores, etc. They steal things when people are not paying attention, regardless of value. They take what they steal and sell it. If they are caught in the act, they put on a pleading expression and perform the whole act of crying and laughing. As a result, they are beaten up and that's the end of it. Sometimes, the "uncles" come out to surround them, so naturally the matter can be reduced from a big deal to a small one.

"White Strips in the Waves" Are Skilled in Swimming

The "Water Rats" gang was originally also within the scope of the "Pickpocketing Party." The brothers in this gang are skilled in swimming. They are the "Turning River Rat" and "White Strips in the Waves" types of outlaws from the Water Margin. They usually make a living by rowing boats to fish or salvaging lost objects in the river, seemingly living a legitimate life, but secretly doing evil in the water and stealing at every opportunity. The gang's slang for "drilling the bottom" means sneaking into the ship's hold to steal, or "water surprise," which means lurking in the water to steal at every opportunity. There are many large and small ships regularly moored in the Huangpu River every day, and even the iron chains and anchors are often stolen by these water rats. Experienced boatmen, for safety's sake, usually pay tribute money to the "uncles" of the Water Rat gang every month. If they are unwilling to give it, the uncles order the water rats to cause a big ruckus, or cut off the iron anchor, or damage the bottom of the ship, causing them to lose a lot of money. This is a hidden rule. When calculated on a monthly basis, it is naturally quite considerable.

Street Bureau Station Someone Else Has Done a Good Deed

In the streets of Shanghai, various scams are often discovered. They use extremely simple methods to lure people into the trap. This is the trick played by the "Cut the Head Play" gang. "Cut the Head Play" is also a branch of the "Pickpocketing Party." Although they are not as actively involved in stealing money as the "Eat Bad Rice" gang, they use passive methods to lure passers-by's hard-earned money. On the surface, they are completely in a divine state. Their ability and spirit can be said to be another achievement, because those who operate are all old and cunning members of the gang, setting up a scam on the street and letting people fall for it.

There are many tricks in the "Cut the Head Play." Every time they go out on the street, they have a small group that works together, ranging from three or four people to more than a dozen. Currently, they are collectively called "Bridge Frames," which includes everything that is set up on the side of the road to make money by scamming. The following is a detailed description:

(1) "Facing the Sky Seal" - setting up a mahjong gambling stall on the side of the street to lure passers-by into the game in order to defraud them of money.

(2) "Leaves" - playing the leaf game of poker, luring passers-by to bet on guessing the old man's head on the card. With skillful techniques, they make it impossible for people to figure it out, and they can win in nineteen out of ten cases. But if a passer-by guesses correctly, they will start arguing and turn hostile, and will never let the bettor take advantage.

(3) "Chess Stall" - setting up a chess stall on the side of the road, arranging a stalemate, deliberately creating an illusion so that both the red and black pieces have a chance to win, luring people into the game. There are chess players everywhere, and chess players always think of themselves as masters. They often get itchy and want to compete, but they have memorized the chess manual. Where are passers-by their opponents? So the result is always that the passer-by loses money.

(4) "Transforming Yellow Goods" - setting up a stall on the side of the road to sell fake goods, such as gold jewelry, antiques, jade, and fake copper coins.

(5) "Flexible Coffin" - hanging a cloth sign on the wall, selling goods and medicine, or teaching various strange magic tricks, spouting nonsense. Their behavior is very similar to that of itinerant performers.

(6) "False Illness Selling Medicine" - selling medicine and giving free medical treatment on the side of the street is originally a promotional method for itinerant doctors. But there are many genuine and effective medicines among itinerant doctors. The "Cut the Head Play" gang is purely slippery in nature, picking up the appearance of the itinerant gang and selling fake medicine to cheat money. They also use partners to impersonate sick passers-by as a public test to gain the trust of passers-by. Then the fake medicine can be sold smoothly on the spot.

(7) "Buying and Selling" - selling collateral gold watches and silver utensils on the street, colluding with partners as passers-by to bargain and haggle in order to lure the "melon" into the trap.

(8) "Collecting Ingots" - When a poor or sick person dies on the street within their jurisdiction, the brothers in the gang rush to the scene and perform a crying scene of "personally viewing and containing the corpse," and then solicit donations from nearby residents to collect money for a coffin and burial. After collecting ingots, they slip away, and as a result, the street corpse still waits for the charitable hall to bury it.

### Appeal Hearing of the Randell Case Opens · Lawyers for Both Sides Engage in a War of Words · Shen Ke's Espionage Work Received Heavy Rewards · Appellant Claims News Was Based on Evidence · News Was Disclosed by the U.S. Military

[Our Newspaper] The suspected German military spy Shen Ke, based on a report published in the China Press on April 16 of this year, which contained a United Press dispatch claiming that Shen had been ordered by the German intelligence agency to go to Chongqing to expose the situation of underground workers of the United Nations and to explore the route for United Nations personnel to enter the interior, deemed this to be libelous behavior and filed a private prosecution with the District Court against Randell, the director of the United Press office in China. Randell was declared innocent. Shen Ke refused to accept this and appealed to the High Court. The hearing opened yesterday morning to investigate the evidence. Judge Wang Jian will continue the hearing on the morning of November 2.

The appellant Shen Ke, because he is still detained in the Tilanqiao Prison, was represented in court by lawyer Yao Zhaodi. Randell was still defended by lawyer Chen Tingrui, and United Press reporter Yuan Lunren served as the translator. The audience was full, especially with members of the press. Reporters from various newspapers were standing to take notes.

News Source · Released by the U.S. Military

Randell claimed: He did write this article, and the source of this news was based on documents released by the U.S. military headquarters intelligence department. Furthermore, the prosecutor in charge of investigating German war criminals held a press conference and announced this matter on the spot. The court then asked: Can you prove it? He replied: This news is based on the announcement by the authorities and can be proven. He now has a certificate issued by the U.S. military headquarters, signed by two U.S. prosecutors in charge of investigating war crimes. These two people convened the press conference, and the signatures were sworn to show solemnity.

At that time, lawyer Chen stood up to supplement and read the full text of the certificate, which stated that on April 16, these two prosecutors, fully representing the U.S. Army, knew from reliable evidence (note: the original text of "reliable evidence" is actually "Evidence now on file") that Shen Ke was actually sent to China in 1942 by the German military intelligence agency O'Hara to act as a German reporter to cover up the activities of secret United Nations workers and to find out the routes for United Nations personnel to sneak into the interior. Chen then submitted the certificate.

Publicly Announced at the Press Conference

The judge then asked on what date the press conference was held, because the date of the meeting recorded on the certificate was April 16, and the China Press on April 16 had already published this news, so Randell must have written this article before April 16. Randell replied: This article was written in the afternoon of the 15th and was still rushed to be published in the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post that day. It was indeed based on the press conference held that morning, because in addition to the United Press, the Associated Press and Chinese newspapers also attended the meeting, and the wording was almost entirely the same when the articles were released.

At that time, lawyer Yao Zhaodi refuted: The date on the certificate submitted by Randell is October 24, which seems to be specifically for today's court hearing. The phrase "Evidence nov on jlie (existing evidence)" in the certificate may not refer to evidence obtained before April 16, but was obtained recently. He requested that the U.S. military court prosecutor be summoned to explain the content of the news released at the press conference on April 16.

Shen Ke Had Intelligence on the China-India Pipeline

Lawyer Chen immediately stood up and said: If the appellant believes that the evidentiary power of the certificate is insufficient, then if today's investigative hearing does not end, the defendant can ask the U.S. military court prosecutor to appear in court! In addition to this, there is also an "official document" that can be used as new evidence. Rudolf, an accomplice in Shen Ke's espionage case, had a moment of conscience during the trial and confessed the truth, saying that the O'Hara Bureau had hired spies, and these spies had hired assistants of different nationalities. Among these spies, the three most effective were the first person, Shen Ke. He supplied information obtained from the Japanese side to intelligence agents who came to Shanghai from the Chinese interior and supplied information from the interior to Germany. This was an extremely dangerous task, and Shen Ke was able to complete it satisfactorily. Most of the information delivered to Germany was transferred by Dr. Takashima, who was responsible for liaison with the Japanese, from the O'Hara Bureau to the Japanese intelligence authorities. The most valuable information was a report on the construction of the China-India pipeline, which was later supplied to the Japanese. Shen Ke was an expert in analyzing the situation and could always point out the significance of the personnel changes in the National Government. In addition, Shen Ke also obtained a lot of U.S. military intelligence. Another accomplice, Ke Xing, also said: Shen Ke's salary in the O'Hara Bureau was the highest in the entire bureau, receiving 3,800 gold marks per month (at that time, every two and a half gold marks were equal to one U.S. dollar), while O'Hara himself received only 1,250 gold marks per day.

Plaintiff Exhausted His Strength in Repeated Debates

At this time, lawyer Yao also refuted: Rudolf had said that the above confession was actually forced, and a written "counter-evidence" was submitted. Lawyer Chen then said that the previous confession had been signed by Rudolf in court, and the details could be asked of Rudolf himself.

Lawyer Yao then pointed out that the defendant's reply had gone beyond the topic. The scope of this case is very clear, only the two facts about Shen Ke mentioned by the defendant in the China Press. Shen Ke is still on trial and has not been convicted. Whether he is guilty or not is still unknown. The defendant's lawyer is now emphasizing the U.S. military court, as if thinking that once someone is a villain, they can be insulted at will. This is truly intolerable in a Chinese court. Even if Shen Ke is convicted in the future, it will not affect the guilt or innocence of the defendant in this case!

At this time, Randell could feel impatient and angrily said: This certificate clearly states that Shen Ke's activities were to investigate the underground work activities of the United Nations in Shanghai and to investigate the routes for United Nations personnel to sneak into the interior. Furthermore, the Associated Press and other newspapers have the same reports. Why does the appellant only sue him alone? It is strange. Knowing that the formal certificate obtained from the U.S. military court cannot be considered valuable, is the evidence submitted by Shen Ke more valuable?

Lawyer Yao said: This case can be judged after the U.S. military court makes a verdict on Shen Ke. The appellant has no preconceived notions; the circumstances of this case are minor and the second instance is the final instance. Please consider it carefully.

Lawyer Chen then said: The conclusion of this case lies in whether the defendant fabricated facts. The defendant's report was based on what was released by the U.S. military, so even if there is defamation, the responsibility lies not with the defendant, but with the U.S. military department. For the sake of fairness in such foreign-related cases, it is hoped that they can be concluded as soon as possible, because foreigners cannot leave the country at will when criminal cases are involved, and the defendant, as a journalist, has the possibility of leaving the country at any time. At this point, Judge Wang then decided to continue the hearing at 10:00 AM on November 2.

### Public Utilities Bureau Director Discusses Electricity Conservation: Hopes Users Will Reduce Consumption by 30%

Zhao Zengyu, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, held a press conference at the City Hall meeting room yesterday at 5:00 PM, reporting on the reasons and methods for electricity conservation in the city. He stated that recently, the demand for electricity in the city has exceeded the supply, making conservation necessary. Therefore, a special commissioner conducted a detailed investigation. The results showed that 60% of the city's electricity users consume less than 20 degrees of electricity per month. Therefore, it is stipulated that 20 degrees will be the standard for general electricity consumption. Those who exceed this standard will have their usage calculated at 70% of their highest usage in the past year. Violators will be fined, and a second offense will result in power disconnection. He hoped that all users would voluntarily conserve electricity. For example, if a household has ten light bulbs, they could reduce it to seven, or if they originally used 100-candlepower bulbs, they could switch to 75-candlepower bulbs. Similarly, those using 40-candlepower bulbs could switch to 25-candlepower bulbs to save electricity. The Bureau will provide individual notifications when reading electricity meters in November, and those who exceed the standard when the meters are read again in December will be penalized according to the electricity conservation measures. This electricity conservation regulation is expected to last until February or March of next year, as the city's electricity supply will then be sufficient, and the measures will be lifted. A table of estimated daily electricity consumption per light bulb is provided below for users' reference:

Bulb Size (Watts): 15W 25W 40W 50W 60W 75W 100W

3 Hours Daily Use (Degrees): 1.35 2.25 3.6 4.5 5.4 6.75 9

4 Hours Daily Use (Degrees): 1.8 3 4.8 6 7.2 9 12

5 Hours Daily Use (Degrees): 2.25 3.75 6 7.5 9 11.25 15

6 Hours Daily Use (Degrees): 2.7 4.5 7.2 9 10.8 13.5 18

### Fang Zhi Hosts Press: Hopes for Cooperation in Promoting National Policies

[Our Report] Fang Zhi, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters, hosted a tea party for the city's press at the Lido Garden yesterday at 3:00 PM. Over a hundred guests from various newspapers attended.

In his impromptu speech, Fang said: The significance of today's gathering lies in two points: First, I have had a close relationship with the press in the past. When I joined the Kuomintang in the seventh year of the Republic (1918), I worked at the Minguo Daily, which was headed by Mr. Ye Chucang. Many people in the Shanghai press today are old friends of mine. I am very happy to be in Shanghai to meet new and old friends, and I would like to seek advice from everyone. Second, I would like to express my gratitude for the comments and encouragement from various newspapers before and after my swearing-in ceremony. I would also like to take this opportunity to offer a few suggestions: (1) I hope that the Party Headquarters and the press can maintain close ties, as the Party serves the people, and the press is the voice of the people, both serving the same target audience. (2) I hope that Party members and journalists can maintain close ties, as both are engaged in written work. As the ancients said, "Make friends through literature, and assist benevolence through friendship." (3) The purpose of these ties is to strive and work hard to realize the Three Principles of the People, promote national policies and decrees, and uphold peaceful unification. We should seek unified peace and unified democracy, that is, democratic unification and democratic peace. If internal strife does not cease, there will be no peace, no unification, and no democracy. Historically, the power of the pen is greater than the power of the gun, as evidenced by the success of the Xinhai Revolution and the Northern Expedition. In the future, the process of nation-building will depend even more on the pen to promote policies and encourage progress. The Party Headquarters plans to hold a general registration of Party members soon and will actively promote the teachings of the Founding Father, hoping for the cooperation of the press.

After Fang's speech, Wang Yunsheng, Zhao Minheng, Wan Meizi, and others spoke in succession, offering opinions on Party affairs. Finally, Fang concluded the gathering by saying that the Municipal Party Headquarters is determined to serve the people in a party manner and to handle Party affairs with a spirit of innovation.

### Social Services: Answering Readers' Questions

Medical and Health

(1) Miscellaneous Medical Inquiries

Zheng Tong Gao Zhengwang asks: (1) Why is the spread of cholera periodic? (2) How to distinguish between acute gastroenteritis and cholera? (3) Please briefly describe the treatment methods. (4) How should trachoma be treated or eradicated? (5) Should infants be given a laxative to remove fetal toxins at birth? (6) What medicine should be taken to relieve pain in the left flank? (7) Is premature ejaculation a disease that impairs fertility? Why does this disease occur? What medicine or injections should be taken to cure it? (8) How to treat neurasthenia, and how to maintain health and well-being? (9) Is the reason for not being able to eat cold drinks and fruits due to a weak stomach? What are the good remedies for it?

[Dr. Zhang Zhongming answers] (1) The growth and spread of cholera bacteria are related to climate and geographical environment, so its spread is periodic. (2) The stool of acute gastroenteritis is yellow, while the stool and vomit of cholera are rice-water-like, the skin is dry and shrunken, the eyeballs are sunken, and dehydration occurs very quickly with very serious symptoms. (3) For the treatment of acute gastroenteritis, Sulfaguanidine can be effective. For cholera, intravenous fluids with plasma and cardiac stimulants must be injected, with oral Sulfaguandine or Sulfadiazine preparations. (4) Trachoma can be cured with trachoma forceps, or with Copper Sulfate and Zinc Sulfate eye drops. (5) An infant's meconium can be naturally excreted, and there is no need to take laxatives. (6) For pain in the left flank, ordinary painkillers can be taken. (7) Premature ejaculation is caused by sexual neurasthenia and can impair fertility. Injections of male hormone preparations should be taken. (8) Those with neurasthenia should pay attention to health, get up early and go to bed early, develop good living habits and get enough sleep, and at the same time inject or take brain-strengthening and nerve-nourishing drugs. (9) Cold drinks and fruits can stimulate the gastric and intestinal membranes and prevent normal digestion, so they should be eaten less.

(2) Head Lumps

Wang Jinggen asks: "I suffered from chickenpox on my head last year, and two small lumps bulged behind my right ear. I was hospitalized for treatment for two months before it healed, but the lumps did not disappear. At that time, I thought it was a swollen lymph node caused by a headache and would disappear after healing. I dared not have surgery rashly, but more than a year after being discharged from the hospital, they have still not disappeared, and every time I think deeply, I feel a hidden pain, which is very distressing. I dare to ask what these lumps are? What is the method to eliminate them? I hope you can advise."

[Dr. Zhang Zhongming answers] Swollen lymph nodes in the head can be treated with Anfu swelling-reducing plaster. If it is ineffective, surgical removal is necessary.

(3) Crooked Mouth and Eyes

Luo Junming asks: My wife is 29 years old this year. Three years ago, her mouth and eyes on the left side suddenly became crooked. She immediately sought treatment with traditional Chinese medicine, but after a long period of time, she still has not recovered. Some say that this disease cannot be completely cured.

### Cotton Yarn Allocation Method Agreed Upon: Duplicate Product Industry Establishes Joint Organization

[Our Report] The Textile and Fabric Industry Management Committee, chaired by concurrent Chairman Wu, allocated 12,004 and a half bales of cotton yarn to various cotton yarn duplicate product industries. Yesterday, representatives from the Six District Cotton Textile Guild and the Textile Construction Company, together with representatives from six guilds, including the Machinery Dyeing and Weaving Industry, thoroughly discussed the allocation procedures at the Hankou Road Textile Construction Company conference room. Jiang , Deputy Director of the Business Department of the Textile Construction Company, presided over the meeting. It was decided that the total amount of yarn to be allocated would be distributed in two installments (i.e., Monday, October 28th, and Monday, November 4th). Each yarn mill will prepare a form every Monday listing the cotton yarn of various branches and trademarks and their prices, and submit it to the Cotton Textile Guild. At the same time, a reservation order will be issued for the cotton yarn allocated. The duplicate product industry guilds will allocate it to member customers based on the yarn allocation table and submit the table to the Cotton Textile Guild. The Guild will issue a reservation order based on the table. The contracted factory will prepare the payment and exchange it for a warehouse receipt from the yarn mill, which must be cleared within ten days.

In addition, the six duplicate product industry guilds in the city, including machinery dyeing and weaving, knitting, underwear, towel, blanket, handkerchief, and handmade cotton weaving guilds, convened a joint meeting of the guilds at 5:00 PM yesterday at the Dyeing and Weaving Industry Guild to execute the work of contracting and allocating cotton yarn and to establish close contact. Representatives of each guild attended the meeting. Pan Shihao presided over the meeting. First, the representative who attended the Textile Management Committee meeting in the morning reported on the process of negotiating the allocation procedures. It was agreed to establish a permanent joint organization, named the Shanghai Cotton Yarn Duplicate Product Industry Guild Yarn Allocation Committee. The chairman, vice-chairman, and group leaders for the examination, allocation, and evaluation groups were elected to smoothly promote the yarn allocation work.

### Yarn Mills Whose Cotton Inventory Is Less Than Three Months Can Apply for Foreign Exchange to Purchase American Cotton

After Mayor Wu went to Nanjing to meet with President Song and made inquiries about the American cotton foreign exchange issue, it is understood that President Song has indicated approval for the resumption of foreign exchange. Mayor Wu then decided that all yarn mills whose current cotton inventory is insufficient for three months can apply for foreign exchange to purchase American cotton. However, to clarify the situation, in addition to ordering the Cotton Trade Association to report the actual amount of cotton in stock to the Textile Management Committee by the 28th of this month, a form will also be prepared to investigate the production situation of each factory, the type and quantity of cotton required. The survey form must be filled in and submitted within one week. Those who report more than they have will have their extra cotton confiscated. Those who do not report after the deadline will be deemed to have given up their rights. It is understood that the cotton inventory of most yarn mills is less than three months' worth. According to the current situation, at least 2 million bales of American cotton need to be ordered.

### Quiet Bond Market

The bond market was sluggish yesterday, with inconsistent supply and demand. Most transactions were small, so the fluctuations were minimal. The Unified C bonds opened at 2030 yuan in the morning. After opening, they stabilized at 2050 yuan for a while. Later, due to the sluggish stock market, buying interest decreased slightly, and they briefly fell below the 2000 yuan mark. However, they finally closed at around 2050 yuan, with little change from the previous close. A and B bonds rose by 20 yuan, D bonds were flat, and Unified E bonds rose by 80 yuan.

### Rice and Wheat Continue to Decline, Oil Prices Rise

The rice market registered over 9,000 shih of cargo, and digestion remained sluggish. Northern Japonica rice was high and flat, while secondary rice was sluggish. Southern Japonica middle and secondary grade rice had few buyers and fell by 1,000 yuan. Yuan Rice was sluggish, and Yin rice was reduced by another 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. The oil market had scarce arrivals. Scarcity makes things valuable. Raw oil and bean oil were rarely available on the market, with only sesame oil having some transactions. Prices were advancing towards a peak. Bean cake oil had strong sales in Shantou, and factories supplied as much as possible, falling back by 300 to 500 yuan. Wheat remained sluggish and unchanged, falling by another 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Soybean arrivals continued, making it difficult to prosper, and continued to fall by 1,000 yuan. Mung beans had little activity. Corn was sluggish, raw peanuts were actively sold in small lots, and prices were rising. Yellow hemp continued to be handled in the South Seas, rising by another 1,000 to 2,000 yuan.

### Customers Must Use Bank Drafts to Purchase Oil Cakes

The Shanghai Oil Mill and Firewood Industry Association has informed the relevant associations that, according to the association's application, all customers who purchase oil cakes from the factories in the industry must use bank or money shop drafts when issuing warehouse receipts, in order to show solemnity.

### Ban on Wheat Re-exports: Jianghai Customs Has Announced Implementation; Flour Rationing Is 9,000 Bags Daily

[Our Report] Since the Executive Yuan issued an order prohibiting the re-export of wheat, the Shanghai Jianghai Customs has announced its implementation on the 24th. From that date, all wheat reported for re-export by the Jianghai Customs, like flour, must first be approved by the Ministry of Food. However, wheat shipped by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) is not subject to this restriction. According to people in the flour industry, the wheat inventory in Shanghai is extremely depleted. Since the ban on re-exports, the market price has fallen to 30,000 yuan per dan. The Flour Industry Association still rations 9,000 bags of flour to flour merchants according to the daily consumption of flour in the city, and they then re-ration it to various cake and steamed bun businesses. It is reported that the Tangyuan, Qiemian (noodles), and Paste industries in the city have also petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau to instruct the association to allocate some flour. It is said that the association plans to hand over the entire daily rationing amount of only 9,000 bags to the Social Affairs Bureau for overall allocation.

### China Silk Corporation Develops Overseas Sales Channels: Negotiations with France Are Quite Successful, American Market Is Not Optimistic

[Taibao Report] China Silk Corporation is working hard to develop overseas raw silk sales markets. Recent negotiations with France have been quite successful. It is heard that France has a strong demand for silk, and the price it has offered is higher than that of the United States. In addition, there are also negotiations in the South Seas area. Qualified personnel pointed out that our country should not have overly optimistic expectations for the sales of raw silk in the United States. Because some American financial groups have actually controlled the Japanese silk industry, the market price of raw silk has been repeatedly lowered. Secondly, the rate of price increases in China and the United States differs too much. Although the United States is experiencing inflation today, prices have not increased more than threefold, while the selling price of raw silk has risen from $2 per pound in 1937 to $700, so sales are naturally not smooth. In addition, the government is determined to export raw silk. Even if the cost is higher than that of other countries, it will adopt a subsidy policy to export it in large quantities, in order to maintain the overseas market.

### Retail Investors Light Up the Market: Chinese Stocks Have Difficulty Rising

Chinese stocks were slightly stable on the local market yesterday, but buying interest remained extremely limited and soon declined again. At the opening, each stock opened slightly higher, but soon sellers became active, and there was no new buying activity in the market. With the lighting up of scattered buyers, the situation was unable to develop. Guangbang (Cantonese investors) did some buying, and the middle of the day rose slightly from the low, but the overall trend was difficult to rise. The traders at the table shorted the machine, making it easy to fall and difficult to rise. Near noon, Mayar created a new low price. Before closing, the shorts slightly covered their positions, and arbitrageurs came in to trade slightly after the low. The afternoon close was slightly lower than the previous close for the popular stocks of Wingsha, Sino, and Xinguang. Mayar, Jingfu, and Qinxing each fell by about half a percent. Tongyi, Rongfeng, Lianan, and Jinglun were flat for the cold stocks. The rest all fell. In the afternoon, due to the two-day interest relationship, it opened well, but the road to advancement was blocked by high arbitrageurs selling out, and gradually shrank. However, there were still many scattered activities near the close, and it was still stable. As a result, the popular stocks of Yongs, Jingfu, Xinguang, Qinxing, and Mayar fell slightly compared with the previous close. Sino alone rose slightly. The cold stocks of Zhongfang, Datong, Zhongsi, Huochai Company, and Wuli Underwear all fell by about half a percent. Tongyi, Rongfeng, Xinya, and Lianan were flat. Cement Huafeng fell slightly. The total turnover was 6.73 million shares. The prices of various stocks outside the market were stable with little change.

Foreign stocks were flat at first and then tired, and it was difficult to recover. There were not many transactions, and the market was quiet. As a result, compared with the previous close, Yisha, Yinglianye, and Guang Paper each fell slightly. Huidefeng, Shipping, Steel, and Yipi each fell by about half a percent.

### Gold Prices Continue to Rise: Foreign Currencies Are Stable

Haqi continued to prosper yesterday, but there was increased pressure at high prices, and it hovered a little more. Sheng opened at 2,255,000. After opening, it gradually stabilized from 2,250,000, but the fluctuations were limited. It was only at ten o'clock that the Central Bank distributed 100 bars at a price of 2,252,500. After this, customer sales were still strong, and funds were even tighter. It once rose to above 2,260,000, but then the pressure increased, and near noon it fell to below 2,250,000. At noon, it still closed at around 2,255,000. In the afternoon, next-day delivery continued to prosper and once rose to 2,270,000 before leveling off slightly. As a result, it rose by another 12,000 compared with the previous close. Decorative gold hung up to 1.44 million, silver was flat, and silver dollars rose slightly. The under-the-table interest rate was even looser, and interest rates fell to about 1.2%.

The transaction of U.S. dollars in the retail market did not develop. In the black market, it was about 4,130 yuan to 4,180 yuan. As a result, it rose slightly compared to the previous close. Hong Kong dollars rose slightly due to the price of gold. There were many buys and sells at around 890 yuan yesterday. As a result, it rose slightly compared to the previous close. The Hong Kong exchange rate was similar, reporting 885 yuan to 895 yuan. Indian remittances were traded at 1,070 yuan, British remittances were traded at 14,100 yuan to 14,300 yuan, and the U.S. exchange rate was not changed, and there were no matching transactions.

### Silk Prices Are Largely Set: 77 Centimeters Is Still a Problem

[Our Report] After consultation with relevant agencies, the purchase price of raw silk will no longer be changed in most cases. Yesterday's Central Bank meeting mainly discussed whether 77 cm raw silk should be calculated as grade D or grade E. Because in the United States, grade D is 78 cm. If our country purchases according to this standard, the income of silk merchants will be reduced. According to an expert reporter: In the United States, each grade of silk does not differ by 110,000 yuan. Now our country is 175,000 yuan, which is already very generous to silk merchants.

### Jinshan Branches Rebound

Jinshan branches have recently become more active in sales, and production prices have increased. Therefore, the price here has also followed closely. Yesterday, the market price of high-grade Zhuangyuan branches opened at 246,000 yuan to 250,000 yuan, and flat branches at 252,000 yuan, an increase of about 10% compared with before.

### Gauze All Decline: Cotton Mills Begin to Sell Off Stock; "Cai Kui" Reaches New Low Price

[Special Dispatch] Yesterday, the yarn market still showed no improvement. Dealers were extremely dispirited. "Special Double Horse" declined directly, closing at 2.3 million, a decrease of 50,000 compared to yesterday. Other brands were also very weak, all falling by 20,000 to 60,000. In particular, the "Hong Kui" and "Cai Kui" brands of Dasheng Yarn Mill had excessive stock, with many sellers. "Cai Kui" once fell to 2.01 million, the lowest price recently. The 42-count yarn was especially difficult to sell, and cotton mills were instead seen selling off their stock, although price adjustments were small.

Since the Textile Control Commission has repeatedly convened meetings to effectively plan the stabilization of yarn and cloth prices, market prices have stabilized. In addition, the joint cotton yarn distribution continues, and the cloth market has gradually declined as a result. In recent days, local merchants in this city have been sluggish in their purchases due to financial constraints. Yesterday, high-end fine cloth such as "Five Blessings Blue Phoenix" from Fangjian was traded at 76,000. Although the price of dyes for "Shilin" cloth has soared, the cloth price is still very weak. "Lanting 190" Shilin cloth produced by Renfeng Factory opened at 125,000 yuan, and "Big Deer Yan Tu Lin" cloth produced on the mainland opened at 120,000 yuan. Other goods also showed weakness.

### Asking Prices High, Transactions Few: Rayon Black Market Reaches Saturation

Yesterday, the rayon market was relatively stable in the morning, but suddenly showed an upward trend in the afternoon. "120" Tianqiao old stock (glossy) was quoted as high as 3.7 million, and various other brands were driven up. "120" Jin San Ma (glossy) was traded at 3.48 million, and mixed brands (semi-gloss) were quoted at 3.05 million, a sharp increase of 100,000 compared to the previous day. However, there were very few transactions, and factory managers were also quite calm. DE grade was quoted 50,000 higher than the previous day, while the price of dried silk remained unchanged. Only a dozen bales were traded throughout the day. The silk market remained cautious, mainly because customers were not making large purchases, and business in local silk and satin stores was also very slow, leading to this situation.

### Fuel Control Commission to Adjust Coal Prices After Allocation? More Taiwanese Coal Shipped to Shanghai

According to sources from the Fuel Management Committee, it is rumored that the committee will adjust the price of allocated coal from next month. However, to maintain production, the price of coal for industrial factories will not be changed, remaining at 140,000 yuan per ton. The allocated quantity will depend on the arrival of goods. Currently, coal sources are gradually becoming clearer, and there should be no shortage of coal for industrial use.

It is reported that 20 coal mines in Taiwan have been taken over, with 12 in operation and 8 not yet restarted. The production volume of operating mines is gradually increasing. Currently, transportation between Shanghai and Taiwan is quite convenient, with an average of two or three ships per month transporting materials from Taiwan Province to Shanghai, mainly coal. It is said that Taiwan Province still has 135,000 metric tons of coal waiting to be shipped to Shanghai.

### Red Rice Production Price Rises

Previously, red rice sales were scarce and sluggish, leading to a significant reduction in shipments from production areas. Recently, with the gradual movement of winter sales, prices have risen repeatedly. It is said that the market price in Shantou for high-quality goods has already exceeded 200,000 yuan.

### Bank of China Launches Original Currency Remittance: Performance Good in Past Half Month, but National Currency Remittances Decrease Relatively

Our country is a country with an extremely large deficit. Overseas Chinese remittances, which offset foreign exchange, have always occupied an important position. In the past, remittances from Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia were very large. Currently, Overseas Chinese in the United Kingdom and the United States have risen to the top position. Before March 4 of this year, during the period of controlled foreign exchange, overseas Chinese remittances were exclusively operated by the Bank of China. After the opening up, many foreign banks also operated in this area, and many Overseas Chinese remittances were lost as a result. The main route was Hong Kong, followed by banks that needed foreign exchange. Based on the Bank of China's statistics, the lost amount in October of last year, during the period of control, totaled 1.09 billion yuan, equivalent to 5.45 million US dollars, while in July of this year it was only 3.8 billion yuan, equivalent to less than 2 million US dollars. Comparing the two, we can see the magnitude of the foreign exchange loss.

Since the opening of foreign exchange and the operation of overseas Chinese remittances by foreign banks, the Bank of China planned to launch original currency remittances. However, restricted by the fact that government banks cannot operate in original currency remittances, and fearing that foreign currency would not be exchanged and withdrawn after being remitted, implementation was delayed. After detailed statistics and investigation, it was confirmed that 80% of the sources of Overseas Chinese remittances were to support their families and would not be kept in the bank for a long time. Therefore, original currency remittances were launched on Double Ten Day. According to sources from the Bank of China, the daily amount has not been very large in the past half month since the launch, but it has been increasing daily. However, the overall Overseas Chinese remittances have not increased as a result. The increase in original currency remittances is offset by a decrease in national currency remittances.

### Pig Iron Prices Soar; Orders Expected Soon

For months, pig iron orders arriving in Shanghai have been greatly reduced due to huge consumption, so iron merchants have not ordered from countries such as the UK and the US for a long time, resulting in sparse local inventory and a sharp rise in prices. In just over ten days, the price has soared from 700,000 yuan to 1.8 million yuan per ton, exceeding the selling prices of wrought iron and hot-rolled iron by a large margin. It is said that orders will arrive soon, and the market price should return to stability.

### Hailin Wool Market Lacks Goods

Hailin wool sticks have been popular for seventeen or eighteen years. After August 13th, imported goods disappeared, and domestic factory goods appeared. However, due to raw materials and sales relationships, they have decreased year by year. At the same time, the street's demand has also been lacking, resulting in a situation of quiet supply and demand in the past two years. Since last year's victory, customer demand has surged. Due to the shortage of woolen cloth in various places, Hailin wool sticks have once again attracted attention, leading to the successive sale of limited old stock. Currently, the market lacks goods, and sales are very smooth.

### Native Paper Sales to the North Cut Off

Native paper, such as heavy-edged paper and mao bian paper, has recently seen a surge in sales and a gradual rise in prices. Religious paper from eastern Zhejiang, such as haifang and ba si huang, was mainly sold to North China. This autumn, transportation has not returned to normal, and transporting to Hebei and Shandong faces numerous obstacles along the way. However, the price difference between Shanghai-Hangzhou and North China is significant, so merchants are not afraid of difficulties and transport the paper for sale. However, in recent months, transportation has become too difficult, so no one is carrying the goods, and the market situation is difficult to improve.

### New Asphalt to Hit the Market; Higher Costs Make Low Prices Unlikely; Several Hundred Bundles of Jiaxing Asphalt Already Dumped

The date for new asphalt production is approaching, and old asphalt is being sold off everywhere. However, users are waiting for new asphalt, inevitably harboring expectations. Moreover, those using it for soap making have already placed orders, and those using it for candle making were preparing for the peak winter season. However, because they are all waiting for cheap new asphalt, the market has been less lively recently. On the other hand, in Hangzhou, the market is gradually turning as supplies have dwindled. It is said that the yield in the Jinlan area this winter is lower than last year, and the estimated purchase price for new asphalt is 100,000 yuan. If so, it will not be cheaper than old asphalt. However, the situation in Jiaxing is better than last year, with several hundred bundles of new asphalt already dumped in various places in the Suzhou area, with prices ranging from 90,000 yuan to 95,000 yuan. Payment must be made before the Beginning of Winter, and asphalt will be delivered between Heavy Snow and the Winter Solstice. It is said that the price of cypress seeds has already been seen, and the purchase price is 25,000 to 26,000 yuan per stone. Based on this, the cost of new asphalt cannot be too low in the future, probably around 100,000 yuan. Local dealers' sales prices have not fluctuated much, with 本车柏油 (ben che bai you) priced at 135,000 yuan, 内坪柏油 (nei ping bai you) at 125,000 yuan, 各牌独砠 (ge pai du zhu) at 120,000 yuan, 的干 (de gan) at 115,000 yuan, 尖麻城 (jian ma cheng) at 110,000 yuan, 荆州油 (jing zhou you) at 120,000 yuan, and 次等麻城油 (ci deng ma cheng you) at 100,500 yuan.

### Previous Orders from Japanese Factories Ordered to Be Fulfilled and Replenished

[Special Dispatch] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently plans to negotiate with the Allied Headquarters in Tokyo. For enemy and puppet economic enterprises that have been taken over in our country's recovered areas, if they had ordered equipment from Japanese factories before the Japanese surrender but had not yet been delivered due to the end of the war, they will be ordered by Japan to fulfill the contract and replenish the goods. To this end, the Executive Yuan specially instructed the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to inform all agencies to investigate and list the equipment that had been ordered from the Japanese side but had not been delivered, with detailed explanations of the original contract attached, and to reply to the ministry by letter for compilation.

### Gallnuts Scarce

Gallnuts, produced in our country, are one of the important raw materials for dyes. In addition to the annual production of several hundred dans each in Hunan and the border areas of Anhui and Zhejiang, most of the production is in Sichuan Province. Among them, 桷西棓 (jue xi bei) has a mild tannic acid content, while 肚棓 (du bei) is quite strong, each with its own chemical characteristics. For example, the fame of Nanjing tribute satin in the past was due to the use of 肚棓 (du bei) to penetrate the pigment, which could make the luster of the satin surface permanently unchanged. Recently, goods from Sichuan Province have been scarce, the reason being the slow transportation time. Each ship takes more than a month to come to Shanghai from Chongqing, and merchants have no profit to be made, so there are few arrivals in Shanghai.

### 6,000 Tons of Sugar Arrive in Shanghai; City Distributes Sugar Every Thursday

The Tainan transport ship of the Taiwan Navigation Corporation has recently been repaired and completed. It set sail from Taiwan on the 22nd, carrying a total of 6,200 tons of Taiwanese sugar, and is expected to arrive today. The company's distribution of Taiwanese sugar will be changed to once every Thursday, starting this week. This week's distribution totals 14,054 bags.

### Sugar Prices Slightly Firmer

Yesterday's sugar market showed a slight shortage of spot goods and became firmer. The association's prices for spot goods rose to 136,750 yuan for No. 20 medium-grain white sugar and 114,500 yuan to 5,000 yuan for raw sugar. Small bags of white sugar recently reached a minimum price of 155,000 yuan. It is said that there is a temporary lack of later batches, so the price turned firm, quoted at 158,000 yuan. No. 24 coarse white sugar was 178,000 yuan to 180,000 yuan. Several dozen bags of 油头黄崙青 (you tou huang lun qing) were opened yesterday at 119,000 yuan to 8,500 yuan. Jianbang 刁青 (diao qing) high-quality goods were 119,000 yuan, and secondary 二睛 (er qing) goods were 156,000 yuan. Due to the lower quality of 浙之议鸟青 (zhe zhi yi niao qing), it was only priced at 83,000 yuan, with only a few dozen bags traded.

### US Newsprint Supply Limited

[United Press Washington, 24th] The US government is currently considering restoring government control over the distribution of newsprint, but relevant parties say that this control will not be revived. Newsprint was rationed during the war. Commerce Department head, Small, recently stated that the supply of US newsprint is limited, while demand is very high. According to government estimates, the total consumption of newsprint in August was 366,000 tons, and the total production in the same month was 379,000 tons.

### Customs Prohibits Import of Perfume and Other Luxury Goods

It is understood that imported cosmetics, in addition to customs duties, must also be subject to commodity tax collection by customs in accordance with the provisions of the Commodity Tax Regulations. Although perfume and face powder are taxable items, they should still be treated as luxury goods according to the Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade. Therefore, customs will still prohibit the import of these items.

### Wenzhou New Xiu Mei Traded at 63,000 Yesterday

Xiu Mei, a low-end green tea, is sold to Morocco in Africa. Although the new goods from Wenzhou have arrived in Shanghai for a long time this year, unfortunately, the selling price is very high, making it difficult for buyers and sellers to reach an agreement. It was not until yesterday that Wuchang Tea Company opened trading, with a total of 63 boxes traded, at a price of 63,000 yuan per dan. For other varieties, high-end black tea is still preferred, and British foreign firms continue to demand it, especially the finest Bailin new black tea. As for old green tea, most of it is moldy and does not suit the taste of buyers, and trading is on the decline.

### Fir Timber Abundant, Prices Weak

Recently, there have been many arrivals of fir timber from Fujian, and prices have become weak. The price of both large and small fir timber has fallen by 10 yuan per foot. Liu'an plywood is scarce and prices are firm. The 37-foot plywood is particularly popular, but there are very few arrivals, so the price remains firm. Songban plywood has recently been available on the market, but the arrival of pine logs is not very smooth, so it cannot be supplied in large quantities.

### Ministry of Education Orders Northeastern and Taiwanese Provinces to Substantially Renew Educational Facilities and Emphasizes Spiritual Rectification

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] The Ministry of Education attaches great importance to the educational facilities in the northeastern and Taiwanese provinces after their recovery. It has now instructed the education departments and bureaus of the provinces and cities to earnestly improve and renovate them, with particular emphasis on spiritual rectification. The ministry will also send a Northeast Education Observation Group and convene education administrative conferences with the directors of the education departments and bureaus of the northeastern and Taiwanese provinces and cities in order to understand and discuss effective ways to improve the educational facilities in these areas.

### Zhang Qingfa Discusses Education in Jilin

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 25th] Jilin City is not only known as a scenic spot in the Northeast, but also as a cultural city in the Northeast in terms of cultural and educational undertakings. Jilin Mayor Zhang Qingfa told reporters: In addition to the Changbai Normal College and the Yongji University preparatory class, which will open in a month, the city of 250,000 people has 8 kindergartens with about 400 children, 34 elementary schools with 21,000 students, and 14 middle schools with 7,000 students. If students receiving higher education are included, an average of one in nine people is receiving education. Jilin Province's cultural and educational undertakings have a future from its traditional perspective, but the current lack of school buildings limits the increase in quantity.

### Ministry of Education Negotiates with Japanese Manufacturing Factories to Order Large Quantities of Physics and Chemistry Instruments

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] The Ministry of Education, in view of the fact that the equipment for physics and chemistry instruments in secondary schools was greatly damaged during the war and urgently needs to be replenished in large quantities in order to improve the efficiency of education, has ordered its affiliated Scientific Instrument Manufacturing Institute to quickly return to work, move to Beijing for thorough adjustment, and expand it to meet needs. The ministry has also entrusted our country's delegation in Japan to negotiate with Japanese scientific instrument manufacturing factories to order a large quantity of physics and chemistry instruments. It is understood that preliminary negotiations have been completed, and it is tentatively planned to order 5,000 sets of junior high school instruments and 1,000 sets of high school instruments, half of which can be delivered within one year.

### Zhenjiang Middle School Teachers Strike for Days Over Suspension of Teacher Respect Fee; Provincial Newspapers Criticize

[Special Dispatch, Zhenjiang, 25th] Zhenjiang Middle School, on the 21st of this month, received instructions from the Jiangsu Provincial Government that all fees similar to the teacher respect fee must not be collected from October 14th. After receiving the order, the school held a meeting of teachers and staff on the 22nd. Principal Cao reported the order to suspend the collection of the teacher respect fee and decided to refund the already collected living allowance to the teachers and staff to the students in full to show absolute obedience to the public order. At the same time, due to the current high prices and the impact on the lives of teachers and staff, it was also decided to resign en masse. The school has been on strike since the 22nd, and there is still no solution as of this morning. Students have been suspended from classes for many days, and parents have complained. Provincial newspapers have unanimously criticized, stating that "whether for public or private reasons, a strike is never a wise solution. It is hoped that the government authorities will quickly resolve this unfortunate incident."

### Victory for Huasheng: Coming from Behind to Defeat Enkas

Reversal in the Final Quarter

[Reported by this newspaper] Last night, the Huasheng basketball team, in the final ten minutes, launched a lightning-fast counterattack, overcoming a significant deficit to defeat Enkas, achieving a come-from-behind victory. The crowd of over a thousand spectators cheered continuously. The score was 41-36, with Huasheng winning by five points. In the first half, Enkas led by a significant ten points, with a score of 21-11.

Huasheng appeared dispirited at the start of the game last night, and their play was disjointed. Enkas also seemed out of sorts. The first quarter ended 6-4, with the Tianjin team ahead by two points. Huasheng performed even worse in the second quarter, with Wang Hongbin scoring only two baskets. The first half ended 21-11. In the third quarter, Huasheng continued to struggle, with the score at 19-28. In the final quarter, the situation suddenly changed. Huasheng's shots hit the mark in quick succession, scoring seven consecutive points, bringing the score to 28-29, just one point behind. Jin Liang, Hongbin, and Jin Ming then scored six more points, ultimately taking the lead at 34-31. Enkas panicked and was unable to recover. The final score was 41-36, marking Huasheng's first victory. Due to leave constraints, Huasheng players will depart Shanghai for Tianjin on the 28th. Thus, the game against the Shantou team has been moved to 5:00 PM tomorrow at the gymnasium.

### On the Eve of the American Election: A Great Mobilization of Women: Mrs. Roosevelt Engages in a Propaganda War

One morning in early October, the landlady handed me a letter with a playful smile and said, "Mr. Mao, you have a wife. Why didn't you tell us sooner?" I took the letter with surprise. "Mrs. Mao" was written on the envelope.

The letter was from the American Democratic Women's Association. It was an invitation, stating that the Democratic Women's Association would hold a lecture at the Midtown Building on 34th Street at 8:00 PM on October 7. The speakers included Mrs. Roosevelt, Mrs. Lehman, and several other unfamiliar names. It expressed the hope that I would attend on time. Since I did not have a "wife," I was about to throw it into the wastebasket when I suddenly noticed the words "Men are welcome to attend" on the back of the invitation. This was an important discovery, at least from the perspective of a journalist.

The chairwoman was Miss Wilkins. She first introduced Mrs. Roosevelt. Mrs. Roosevelt's speeches have always been both serious and humorous. Her deep and steady voice was even more relaxed and interesting than when she spoke at the United Nations. She said: Elections are the freedom of the people. I cannot force you to elect anyone, but I would like to recommend Mead and Lehman to you. Then she greatly praised Mead and Lehman, but not excessively or disgustingly. She did not mention "the Republican Party," but always said "the opposing party." Her criticism of the Republican Party was thorough. Each time she mentioned "the opposing party," the audience burst into laughter.

### Mrs. Roosevelt on the Platform: She Said: Not to Rule Men, But to Cooperate Equally with Men

At the women's conference, Mrs. Roosevelt did not talk about foreign policy or the world situation. To suit the tastes of the female audience, her speech was very popular. At least, in all the Mrs. Roosevelt's speeches I've heard, it was the most popular. She said that if the Democratic Party candidates were elected, they would definitely seek happiness for the sisters in New York State. She said: "Our women's demands on American politics are: "Of The Women by The Women, For The Women" (I don't know how to translate this)," But, she then added, "We do not ask to rule men, but to cooperate equally with men." The audience burst into laughter.

In her speech, Mrs. Roosevelt mentioned her husband once, and the crowd cheered wildly. The American people's remembrance of the late President Roosevelt is a rare phenomenon in American history. Speaking about how women can register to vote, Mrs. Roosevelt suddenly became "old-fashioned" and said: "I am old, and I don't understand these procedures very well. Let me introduce to you Mrs. Norton, a young female comrade in our Democratic Party!" With that, she sat down.

In fact, Mrs. Norton was also gray-haired. She was a female senator in New York State and a key member of the Democratic Party's activities in New York State. She was wearing a "foreign drum hat," which was a bit "odd."

### Mrs. Lehman Supports Her Husband

Then, Mrs. Roosevelt introduced Mrs. Lehman to speak. She introduced her by saying: "This is the wife of our former New York State Governor, and now the wife of a candidate for the New York State Senate." Mrs. Lehman was very elegant, but she inevitably felt a little "stage fright" in an unfamiliar setting. She read from four pages of prepared speeches, the content of which was to hope that everyone would register quickly and not give up the right to vote, and that she would hope that everyone would elect her husband to be a member of the Senate representing New York. Her support for her husband did not cause any aversion. The wording and tone were both very modest and sincere.

### Only Those Who Are Registered Have the Right to Vote

A virtuous and capable wife is a necessary condition for people in politics in a democratic country.

Afterward, a male guest gave a speech. He was sent by the Democratic Party to support the women's fire party. He spoke very little. He told many humorous and light-hearted jokes about the "relationship between men and women" to arouse the interest of the audience. Then, he urged everyone to quickly register as voters. In New York, the mobility of the population is the greatest. New York does not have a system like China's baojia system, so who has the right to vote and who does not is very problematic. Therefore, "registration" is a very important step. Only those who are registered have the right to vote. The election date is November 5, and the registration dates are from October 7 to 12. In a country like the United States, their interest is in making money, post-making money hedonism, as well as seeking a better life and enjoyment. The average American citizen has no interest in politics. Therefore, the number of people who give up registration is very large. Their campaign movements are secondary to boasting about themselves. The first thing they do is to urge people to register enthusiastically. Only after they have registered can they talk about elections and other things.

### Life First: An Old Man is Dissatisfied with Reality

I did not listen to the entire program and left the meeting hall. An old man in his fifties yawned and walked with me. He said: Mrs. Roosevelt is very popular. I asked him if he would vote for the Democratic Party. He smiled and said, "Thirty years ago, America had plenty of pork, beef and ham. Pork was eighteen cents a pound and ham was twenty-four cents." He said that he got married in New York thirty years ago, "That was when life was comfortable!" I asked him: "What about now?"

He compared his hands: "You can't buy anything!"

"So, do you mean that you are going to elect the Republican Party?"

"I don't even know myself!"

I could see his dissatisfaction with the current situation. Life, life, everything is life first! On the way home, I bought a copy of the "Daily Mirror" at the tram station. It had a cartoon of many stores on the street with signs on their glass windows saying: "No meat, sugar, milk," etc. At the end of the street was a sign that read: "Election Registration Office, Welcome to Register."

This is a very, very real problem. The Democratic Party's economic policies have contributed to the world, but, as of today, the serious economic imbalances in the United States cannot be denied in any way.

### Establishing a New Standard: Rectifying Officialdom in Zhejiang Province

— Hangzhou Report, 16th [of Month], by Special Correspondent Yusheng

There is an old saying in China: "Promotion and wealth" means that if a person becomes an official, money will come rolling in. Therefore, General Yue Fei once had the warning: "Civil officials do not love money, military officials are not afraid of death." Why can one "get rich" after being "promoted"? In the past, officials were seen as the parents of the people, and illegitimate children had to be filial to their parents. A place was equal to a family. Officials were the heads of the family, and they could use money as they pleased. Since the Republic of China, the "official" has been changed to a "public servant," but in reality, the "official" is still the "official," and the common people still have to be filial. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the style of the "officials" did not change, compared with the past, it was just a change in form. After the War of Resistance Against Japan, the "officials'" salaries were low, not enough to maintain life, so "unexpected income" and "extra demands" became common phenomena.

Some people say: "All crows in the world are black." Zhejiang, which has always been known for its relatively enlightened politics, is no exception. When the county magistrate takes office, there is a welcome feast, and you can't get away from it. When the county magistrate leaves office, there is a farewell feast, and you can't get away from it. While the county magistrate is in office, he wants to please the local sellers with "affection," and the local gentry want to talk about "affection," but there is no way to avoid it. The county magistrate can make money in "affection." As for the civil servants below the county level, they are especially majestic, and many people can only dare to be angry but not speak out.

As of the end of September this year, there have been a total of 385 changes of county magistrates in Zhejiang Province, but less than one-third, or 121, have been settled, and the rest are still pending. Of the remaining 264 unsettled cases, excluding 48 cases that are about to be completed and 26 cases with no set deadline, we can analyze them into five categories: (1) 44 cases where the successor has not investigated. (2) 47 cases where the investigation has begun. (3) 34 cases where the files were lost and the office was cleared for transfer. (4) 55 cases where the transfer procedures were not complete. (5) 10 cases where the investigation was completed but not reported. Based on this statistic, we are saddened by the failure to settle the accounts during the transfer of county magistrates, which inevitably makes people feel suspicious. Among them, we should pay special attention to the 44 county magistrates whose successors have not investigated.

### A Full Month's Salary is Only Enough to Smoke Cigarettes

I have met many county magistrates and county-level civil servants, and they all say that it is not easy to be a county-level civil servant. Five months ago, the county magistrate could only get 50,000 to 80,000 yuan per month, and the section chief could only get 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. Assuming that the county magistrate smokes a pack of cigarettes every day at a price of 900 yuan, then it would cost 27,000 yuan a month. If you add smoking cigarettes to entertain guests, wouldn't it cost more than 50,000 yuan? Then a section chief's salary cannot be used to smoke cigarettes, and the county magistrate's salary for the entire month is only enough to smoke cigarettes. However, the county magistrate's entire family has to rely on him to support them. Even if they do some part-time work, the county government can use them, and they can live in the county government, but they still have to pay for their daily meals. From time to time, people from above come, and they must be entertained, drinking alcohol and tasting tea, all of which require money. Where does the county magistrate's money come from? Therefore, a special commissioner of Zhejiang Province said at an administrative meeting: "The result of the low salaries of civil servants is that there is no official who is not corrupt."

### Banning Extortion and Taxes: Why Are There Still Apportionments?

Yes, many county officials in Zhejiang Province harass the people, causing them to live in poverty. There are endless donations, such as the revitalization donation and the construction donation. Where did the money go? Has the place been revitalized? Has it been built? I have also met many fair people in the area, and their expressions to the county officials are, on the one hand, to sympathize with the poverty of the county officials, and on the other hand, to hate the extortion of the county officials. Although the Zhejiang Provincial Government has decided to ban all exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous taxes, some counties are still using the pretext of running education and building water conservancy projects to apportion money from the people. We are not against running education and water conservancy projects, but we want the people to feel that education and water conservancy must be run, and let the people solicit donations. This is meaningful. However, some responsible people in the county said: "The Zhejiang Provincial Government's ban on apportionments and the abolition of exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous taxes are just a piece of paper. The county government's finances are difficult, and it is impossible to do without apportionments."

### Relying on the Power of the Government: Officials and Businessmen Do Not Distinguish Between Public and Private Affairs

Prices are like a man-eating tiger, constantly jumping. County-level civil servants who are relatively capable will naturally gather some money, do some speculative business, or lend some high-interest loans. Relying on the power of the government, they are naturally more successful than other businessmen. As a result, prices jump even higher. This meager salary is naturally not worth considering, and the officialdom is a good backer for conducting their own business. In this way, officials and businessmen are not distinguished, public and private affairs are not distinguished, and affection and law are not distinguished. It is a chaotic and muddled mess.

### It is Not Easy to Break the Habit of a Greedy Cat

Two months ago, the civil servants in the Zhejiang District were adjusted, with a base salary of 60,000 yuan and a multiplier of 300. The salary of the county magistrate, from the sixth to the first grade of the recommended level, ranged from 150,000 yuan to 180,000 yuan. The salary of the section chief, from the sixth to the first grade of the assigned level, ranged from 96,000 yuan to 120,000 yuan. Compared with the 30,000 to 40,000 yuan or 70,000 to 80,000 yuan, it is naturally better, but it is not easy to immediately improve the behavior of a greedy cat that has become accustomed to eating and stealing. Those who are also engaged in business are still the same, and those who are still trying to find extra ways to demand are still the same, so prices are even higher and life is even more difficult to maintain. Recently, the salary has been adjusted again, with a base salary of 90,000 yuan and a multiplier of 540. The salary of the county magistrate ranges from 200,000 yuan to 300,000 yuan, and the salary of the section chief ranges from 150,000 yuan to 200,000 yuan. If you can save money and live a frugal life, and truly "worry about the world before the world worries," you can still maintain it. It's just that we still have to see if we can make up our minds to resolutely ban all habits and all malpractices.

### Seeing Bad Officials Makes Us Ignore the Good Ones

Now, the general public thinks that officials are sure to be corrupt and make money, and the officials think that their salaries cannot keep up with prices, so what can they do without some extra demands? Having said that, in fact, there are also many civil servants who do not have any extra demands, who truly live a difficult life, and who work diligently, but they are taken over by some people who have corrupted the atmosphere. People only see the bad ones and ignore the good ones. I once thought: if all civil servants were not corrupt, did not do business, and lived a difficult life, then prices would not rise so much, and perhaps the living salaries of civil servants would have been adjusted long ago. It is a pity that those who cannot keep their integrity have ruined the reputation of civil servants.

### Ardently Hoping for Reform: Do Not Follow the Old Path of Officialdom

The reporter sincerely hopes that the Zhejiang Sparrow government can make up its mind to make a new start. In addition to strictly prohibiting apportionments and abolishing exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous taxes, there also needs to be an order strictly prohibiting civil servants from engaging in business. Regarding the strict prohibition of civil servants from engaging in business, the public should be encouraged to report violations, otherwise, half-official and half-businessman, officials and businessmen will not be distinguished, the officialdom will also become a store, and the store will be similar to the government, only to suffer the poor people who are gasping for breath under high prices.

Secondly, it is also necessary to strictly prohibit civil servants from extravagantly entertaining and stipulate economical ways to entertain guests. Rewarding honest officials is really the way to rectify officialdom. There is also one of the most important things, that is, the personnel system must be sound, otherwise, the county magistrate will have the idea of being a temporary official for five days in the capital, and will be afraid of being transferred as soon as he takes office. Naturally, he will try to make a fortune while in office.

Zhejiang Province was originally a province with relatively enlightened politics. It is really hard to say how enlightened it has been in recent years. We hope that officials must have a good heart and be determined to be good officials, and the superiors should also think more for good officials and establish a new and sound standard.

### "Black Alert" in Eastern Jiangxi! Constructing a Strong Fortress to Encircle and Suppress the Plague, Thoroughly Completing Prevention and Control Work Before the Autumn-Winter Epidemic Season

— Nanchang Dispatch, 19th. Special Correspondent Liu Zao

The war brought unparalleled disasters to the people of Jiangxi, and it also spread various terrible epidemics. The plague, which had been dormant in Fujian for nearly forty years, also revived during the war. When the brutal enemy troops entered Fujian, coastal residents moved to Jiangxi in droves, and the man-eating "Black Death" was thus transmitted. Its transmission route initially went from Nanping and Duwu in Fujian to Guangze. Another route went from Pucheng to Guangfeng. Due to poor epidemic prevention equipment, it spread year after year to Nancheng, Nanfeng, Lichuan, Linchuan, Guangchang, Shangrao, Jinxi, and other counties. Now, black terror almost covers most of Jiangxi province. The expansion of the epidemic area, the large number of deaths, and the rapid spread are truly frightening.

Border Area Between Fujian and Jiangxi: Dead Rats Discovered

The earliest record of the plague in Jiangxi was in March of the 30th year of the Republic of China when several dead rats were found in a rice shop in Shunhuafang, Guangze, near Fujian, due to frequent transportation between Fujian and Jiangxi. No one paid attention to it at the time. Later, dead rats continued to be discovered, and plague patients appeared. It was then suspected to be the plague. Therefore, the initial date of occurrence and the number of patients were not recorded. As the infection spread more widely, the local authorities immediately notified the Provincial Health Department to dispatch epidemic prevention personnel to carry out prevention and control. As of June 17, of the 34 people treated, 28 died, 5 were cured, and 1 escaped. The high mortality rate was truly alarming!

The Plague's Main Camp: Nancheng Issues an Emergency

The plague germs, which killed millions, then spread to Nancheng in June of the 33rd year of the Republic of China. The epidemic was fierce from the start. At that time, it was after the Zhe-Gan Campaign, and Nancheng was ravaged by the enemy. People were panicked and unable to attend to the matter. A spark, therefore, started a prairie fire!

The plague in Nancheng spread out from the city to the countryside, extending like a fan towards Xiaoshi, Shihou, Bogan, Zhuliang, Xinfeng, Funiu and other townships. According to medical institutions' statistics, a total of 675 patients were discovered, with 362 deaths. The number of deaths that were not diagnosed, concealed, or not reported was not included. Therefore, Nancheng became the "main camp" of the plague in Jiangxi.

Airborne Transmission: Expansion of the Epidemic Area

After a period of lull, the epidemic in Nancheng became even more rampant in October of the 34th year of the Republic of China. The epidemic area expanded to over sixty or seventy li away. The most severe cases of "pneumonic plague" and "meningitic plague" were discovered. According to medical experts, these two types of plague bacteria can be transmitted through the air, and their rate of spread and mortality rate are many times higher than that of ordinary plague.

Patients Turn Black All Over: Death Within Two Days

Nanfeng, a neighboring county to Nancheng, was also affected. In a household under a willow tree outside the county seat, two dead rats were initially seen. Then, two children brought by relatives suddenly fell ill, and one died within two days. Then another child fell ill, and also died within two days. The symptoms were all over the body turning black, with tears and nasal discharge but no cough. Soon after, a woman, Yuan Chen, also suddenly developed a high fever and headache, bloodshot eyes, and a bluish-black complexion, and died that evening. From then on, the epidemic spread to Lijia Pai, Yue Miao, and other places. Cases also occurred in Chuanfang, 30 li from the city. According to statistics, the mortality rate in that area exceeded 60%.

As the plague crossed into Nancheng, it also crept into Lichuan County. In November of the 34th year of the Republic of China, a woman named Deng, who had returned home from attending a funeral in Xiaoshi Township, Nancheng, immediately fell ill and died. After that, plague patients continuously appeared in the city, and deaths followed one after another.

Once It Invades Southern Xun: The Entire Province is Threatened

Due to the formation of the "plague's main camp" in Nancheng, the evil claws of the epidemic covered the entire eastern Jiangxi. Guangchang, Jinxi, Linchuan, Shangrao, and other counties have all issued "black alerts" one after another.

Linchuan is only a one-day trip from Nanchang and Jiujiang. It is the distribution center for food in eastern Jiangxi, with frequent transportation. If the epidemic in Linchuan revives, southern Xun may become an indicator of plague germs invading, and the lives of the people of the entire Jiangxi province will be under a serious threat.

Among the areas in Jiangxi affected by the plague, Nancheng has the most patients, followed by Guangze. According to preliminary investigations and statistics (minimum figures), Nancheng has a total of 675 plague patients, with 372 deaths; Guangze has 525 patients, with 182 deaths. In January of this year, Nanfeng had 93 plague patients, with 51 deaths; Lichuan had 93 patients, with 39 deaths; and Linchuan had 57 patients, with 16 deaths.

Setting Up Epidemic Prevention Offices in Nancheng and Linchuan

What about the work of plague medical prevention and control? In view of the plague's invasion, the Jiangxi Provincial Health Department immediately dispatched epidemic prevention teams to various epidemic areas for medical treatment and prevention and control, and established an epidemic prevention office in Nancheng. Although the plague has not been completely eradicated in these years, it has indeed been quite effective.

In addition to the 1st and 9th squadrons of the Provincial Epidemic Prevention Headquarters stationed in Linchuan, the 3rd squadron stationed in Nancheng, the 5th squadron stationed in Nanfeng, and several health technicians stationed in Lichuan, epidemic prevention offices and isolation hospitals have also been established in each county to treat patients who have already been infected.

Three Steps to Prevent the Plague: Intensified Implementation

Faced with this epidemic that threatens people's lives, the Jiangxi Branch of the Executive Yuan decided to implement planned prevention and control. In May of this year, it dispatched the first mobile medical and epidemic prevention team set up by the branch, together with personnel from the Health Department, to start large-scale eradication work in eastern Jiangxi.

First, the team gave a general preventive injection to the people in the epidemic area. At that time, 6,659 people were injected in Nancheng, 1,515 people were injected in Guangchang, and 500 people were injected in Jinxi. Injections were also given to households in the countryside of Linchuan, Nanfeng, and other counties.

The second step was to carry out rat extermination and flea eradication work in various places. In Nancheng, 9,521 rat holes were filled, 6,155 rat holes were fumigated, 1,697 rooms were sprayed with flea-killing agents, and 1,819 rats were collected. Similar work was also carried out in Linchuan, Guangchang, Jinxi, and other counties.

The third step was to simultaneously establish plague isolation hospitals in the epidemic area, dispatch medical and technical personnel, and transport large quantities of medicines and equipment to carry out medical treatment.

Recognizing the Necessity of Addressing the Root Cause: Experts Exert Efforts

After emergency measures were taken, medical experts believed that there was a need for further "addressing the root cause." Thus, they built fortresses to encircle and suppress the plague in various places. The methods were: (1) Establishing epidemic prevention committees in each county, with the commissioner and county magistrate as the chairman and the president of the provincial hospital as the vice chairman, responsible for presiding over epidemic prevention matters. (2) Launching epidemic prevention publicity. (3) Studying methods to eliminate the pathogen. (4) Strengthening isolation hospitals. (5) Strengthening plague intelligence. (6) Managing the epidemic area. Villages where the plague occurs should be specially managed, and no one should be allowed to travel to and from them, so as to prevent its spread in a containment manner.

Improving Knowledge Level: Beneficial for Rat Extermination

Currently, the most difficult problem in eradicating the plague in Jiangxi is that the public's knowledge level is too low. They are ignorant of the dangers of plague transmission, often concealing it and even fleeing elsewhere for fear of being forced to go to the hospital. As for the Baojia, they are also shielding out of sentiment and not reporting, so the true number of patients cannot be counted.

Most of the local gentry and Baojia chiefs hold old-fashioned ideas, conceal and do not report the epidemic situation, and do not assist in the management of the epidemic area. They do not know how to engage in prevention work and improve environmental hygiene, but only know how to seek gods and worship Buddhas, hold Taoist rituals to send off boats, and other superstitious acts, so that the transmission becomes more and more widespread and difficult to deal with.

Completing Prevention and Control Before the Plague Season

Hospital equipment is lacking, and medicines and equipment are also insufficient. The Jiangxi Branch of the Executive Yuan distributes few types of medicines, and the provincial and county health agencies are all financially strapped, so there is no talk of purchasing medicines.

It is now heard that the Jiangxi Branch of the Executive Yuan, in order to assist in the thorough eradication of the plague in eastern Jiangxi, has approved the allocation of a large number of medicines and 25 million yuan in national currency, which will be used by the Eastern Jiangxi Plague Prevention and Control Office. The branch has also sent a special commissioner, Liu Nan, together with Dr. Sanderson from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) office in Jiangxi and plague prevention and control expert Mr. Boriss from the Health Department, to inspect the Linchuan and Nancheng areas. A plague prevention and control symposium was also held in Nancheng, which decided to establish the Eastern Jiangxi Plague Prevention and Control Headquarters in Nancheng and set up branch offices in Linchuan and Lichuan to prepare for the completion of prevention, control, and eradication work before the plague season in late autumn and early winter of this year.

### A Glimpse of Hefei

— Dispatch from the 12th. Dou Baiping

Hefei has many historical sites. Due to the reporter's limited time, I only visited Mingjiao Temple, Xiaoyaojin, and Bao Gong River and had a quick look. This place has been occupied by the enemy for eight years, and many places in the city have changed. These three places are naturally not what they used to be.

Mingjiao Temple is on East Gate Street, nestled in the middle of residential houses. However, the temple's position is suddenly high. You have to step up more than a dozen stone steps to enter the main gate. To the right, there is a small pavilion, which is said to be the old site where Cao Cao of Wei reviewed his troops, called the Dianjiangtai (Troop Review Platform). In fact, whether this is true or not, the reporter dares not make a definitive report to the readers, because in addition to this high earthen platform, there are no other relics of Cao Cao to be seen, and there is no record in the official history. It is only true that Hefei belonged to the Wei Kingdom during the Three Kingdoms period. As for whether Cao Cao really reviewed his troops here that year, no one can be sure.

Xiaoyaojin is famous for the prestige of Zhang Liao during the Three Kingdoms period. It is said that it was originally outside the city of Hefei. During the Ming Dynasty, the city of Hefei was rebuilt and expanded, and Xiaoyaojin was surrounded in the northeast corner of the city. Now, it is just a vast grassland, only for sightseeing and remembrance.

Going left out of the Nanxun Gate, it is only a few dozen steps to Bao Gong Temple. The temple is in the middle of the water, with a stone statue of Bao Xiaosu. When the enemy occupied it, the temple buildings were damaged a lot. Next to the temple is a memorial pavilion where Bao Gong studied in his childhood. Opposite the temple is Baojia Village, which is the descendants of Bao Gong. They all look like impoverished households. Recently, the provincial government allocated 10 million yuan to rebuild Bao Temple, so it will definitely be a new look in the near future.

### Two Grand Gatherings in Paris

— Paris Air Mail, 10th. Wang Ren

In recent years, the status of overseas Chinese has been increasing day by day, soaring with the wind. France, in relation to China, is a democratic and advanced country in terms of politics, and the two share similar national characteristics, both being rich in ideals and inclined to freedom in the Southern Continent. In normal times, they share similar sentiments, and in times of trouble, they help each other. Our Chinese Ambassador to France, Qian Tai, as a legal expert, holds an important diplomatic post. At the first Paris Peace Conference in 1919, he had already represented the Ministry of Justice as a specialized commissioner. At the second peace conference, which continued from July to October of this year, he, together with former Foreign Minister Guo and Ambassador Fu, served as the official representatives of the Republic of China. This year's 35th Double Tenth National Day happened to be held before the end of the peace conference. As a result, the magnificent scene outside the embassy at No. 11 Avenue George V in the 8th arrondissement of Paris was almost unprecedented since the establishment of the embassy.

Guests, after arriving on the first floor and being announced by the attendant, entered the Chinese hall to the right, shaking hands and congratulating Ambassador Qian and Madam Qian. Then, they turned into the hall on the left, which was filled with plates of delicacies, allowing people to sample the culinary treasures. Among the guests were people of all kinds, including the red-robed Papal Ambassador and the black-skinned African representatives to the peace conference, as well as Ms. Yang Yunxin, a green-clad and red-lipped artist from China, and Ms. Ji Bang, the black-haired and dark-skirted female secretary of Ambassador Hu to Russia. Zhao Gongyi, the former Consul General in Paris, who is considered a veteran in the consular world, Ambassador Jin Wensi to Belgium, who has participated in both peace conferences over the past 30 years, Madam Jin Zhu Meifang, Counselors Sheng Jun and Jiang Xi, Madam Gong, Madam Jiang, etc., people who are not usually seen, can all be seen at this time. Looking up, it is like ascending an international palace; looking down, it is like stepping on Chinese soil. There were nearly a thousand people rubbing shoulders. The joy of this gathering is not easy to come by in other years.

After the embassy's celebration was completed, the grand meeting celebrating National Day at the "Hemicycle" of the Sorbonne, the highest academic institution in Paris, in the 5th arrondissement, began under the leadership of Ambassador Qian, following the established procedure.

At this time, the Chinese and foreign men and women who attended the meeting were seated in the boxes and stalls, no longer chatting and laughing as in a tea party, but becoming spectators around the stage. After the chairman group, including Mr. Zhang Nan, delivered congratulatory speeches, it was followed by a revue. There were light and agile jumping, driving, and other skills, as well as illusions, and Western songs that resonated through the clouds. The Chinese ladies who were welcomed by the general audience, walking slowly, displayed the refined cultural traditions passed down for thousands of years, like the bright moon in the sky and the light clouds emerging from the mountains, which are absolutely opposite to the quick and agile posture of Westerners. This is the reporter's occasional thought at a gathering of countless wonders. Mr. Du Fang and other members of the famous French weekly "Paris Actualites," who love our country and are proficient in Chinese, were diligently filming on the scene that day. It is heard that they will soon publish their findings to the world.

### Taiwan After the Restoration

— Photo by Chen Xunyu

Taiwan, also named Formosa, in Dutch, means "beautiful island," so the scenery is beautiful and the four seasons are like spring. In the past, the island was originally Chinese territory. After the Europeans moved east, the Spanish, Portuguese, and Dutch successively colonized the island and lived with the Han Chinese. During the Yuan Dynasty, a patrol and inspection office was set up, and the Penghu Islands and Taiwan were incorporated into the Chinese territory. During the early Ming Dynasty, in the 20th year of Hongwu, the patrol and inspection office was abolished and merged into a part of the Chinese mainland. During the Jiajing period, it became a base for pirates such as Zeng Yiben and Lin Feng. Until the eighth year of Chongzhen, Zheng Zhilong occupied Taiwan and resisted the Qing Dynasty. His son Zheng Chenggong was also unwilling to be a slave of the captives. He sent troops to serve the king and served Tang Wang. He was named Duke of Zhongxiao. After the failure of the northern expedition, he led 25,000 troops to retreat to Taiwan, landed in Kaohsiung, and fought a bloody battle with the Dutch soldiers. The Dutch were unable to support themselves and surrendered, and it became a vassal state of China again. In the tenth year of Tongzhi, Ryukyuans were killed in Taiwan. The Japanese negotiated with the Qing government. Later, China and Japan fought and signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, formally ceding Taiwan to Japan. It was the thirteenth year of Tongzhi, 1894 in the Western calendar. At the close of the Cairo Conference, the four major leaders jointly decided that Taiwan was originally Chinese territory and should be returned to our country. After Japan surrendered unconditionally, on October 25 of the 34th year of the Republic of China, our government sent Chen Yi to Taiwan to accept the surrender. The mountains and rivers were restored, and Taiwan rejoined the Chinese territory. In total, the Japanese ruled Taiwan for 52 years. The people of Taiwan have been deeply poisoned by Japanese enslavement education, thought, and writing, so the issue of re-education in the future is not to be ignored. The people of Taiwan were the first base to resist the Manchu Qing Dynasty, and the people are rich in national concepts, so they build temples and offer annual sacrifices to Zheng Chenggong's anti-Qing enterprise, which has not declined to this day. This time, the Chinese news industry organized a Taiwan inspection group in front, and Chairman Jiang and President Song inspected after the first anniversary of the recovery, which shows the importance that our country's government and people attach to Taiwan. The compatriots in Taiwan have now seen the light of day again, so they also place unparalleled enthusiasm and expectation on the unification of China and the restoration of Taiwan. The Taiwan pictures published in this issue were taken by our newspaper's general manager, Chen Xunyu, during his trip to Taiwan, which is enough to get a glimpse of Taiwan.

### The Origin of the "Civilized Aborigines"

Two hundred and seventy-two years ago, in the spring, twenty-four strong men from the indigenous community of Zhu Mu Na, in Xia Da Pu, Jiayi, hunted in Batongguan and the nearby mountains. They chased a white deer that fled northeast, followed by their dogs, crossing mountains and ridges, wading through streams, enduring hardships. When they reached the lake, they saw its beautiful scenery and fertile land suitable for agriculture and fishing. They returned with joy, discussed with their comrades, and obtained the consent of the community, so they moved to this place. Initially, a settlement was formed on the east side of the lake, at the Stone Seal.

Later, when the electricity project was completed, the water level rose by dozens of feet, and all the fields and houses were submerged. Therefore, they moved again to the present settlement. As of July of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, there were 31 households, with a population of 65 men and 56 women, totaling 121 people. As of June of the 35th year of the Republic of China, there were 32 households, with a population of 81 men and 68 women, totaling 149 people.

### The Story of Four People

— Written by Barbusse, Translated by Xishi

Every evening, at the corner of two streets, not far from the bright gas lamp, a young man stood there, his thin and pale face resembling an extinguished gas lamp.

Every day at a certain time, he would come to a certain place, pacing back and forth for a long time, summoning up his courage to look around, as if searching for someone, even staring at pedestrians, trees, and walls. His gray coat had turned green. It hung down on his thin shoulders. In the light shining on him, one could see the sparse beard on his swollen yellow cheeks; looking at his forehead in the light, there was not a trace of color. If it were a clear evening, this weak man would be timidly stranded on the edge of the crowded sidewalk, like a ship run aground, questioning the entire universe. But at a certain moment, someone would see him suddenly straighten up, a bright expectation appearing on his face.

A lively woman walked towards him. Like a rose, she stopped under his nose, showing him her snow-white teeth, shaking her neck surrounded by a fur collar, and singing sweet songs to express her welcome to him. On his side, a smile began to appear, and a continuous, crazy laugh. He balanced his body, but trembled violently, like a person drowning in water, pulled out and set upright. She was an absolutely beautiful woman, despite her tattered clothes. However, her beauty and the shabbiness of her clothes were in stark contrast. She seemed to be in costume, like a goddess on stage, her eyes and lips making people suspect they were sculpted.

The man's desire to come here was restored by his ecstasy. When he started talking, some words stopped at his lips. He took the woman's hand, one small and delicate, the other thin and slender, and they walked away together. Both of them were so thin that, from a distance, it could be said that they were two people divided from one person.

Over there, a hundred paces from here, amidst the shoulder-to-shoulder crowd, every evening a young woman stood there, also waiting for someone.

She often arrived early, and when she didn't see anyone, she would slowly drag her feet beside the newspaper stand.

She was wearing a coarse gray dress, shrouded in infinite melancholy. A blue ribbon on her hat was her only decoration. In the flashes of passing delivery trucks, her irregular, aged face would be reflected. Under her eyes, her nose was prominent and long, and she had a wide mouth. Sometimes she yawned, and her long teeth would flash outside her lips, revealing a hideous appearance. Her deep, dark eyes flickered constantly, her expression unusually tired, but soon she would become very alert again, as if waking up. In order to cheer herself up, she strangely dragged her feet quickly, swinging her right hand, which gripped an umbrella handle, and her left hand, which held the umbrella handle. Then she changed again. Her eyes shone like lightning, and her lips moved, talking in a low voice, in the same attitude as many people praying.

The reason was that over there, a man of leisurely demeanor was coming towards her. He was a heroic man, with broad shoulders, red cheeks, and a thick beard.

He approached and nodded to her. She didn't move at first, like a stunned bird. Her hands also trembled like the tips of bird wings. He didn't speak, and she couldn't speak either. Later, she decided to reach out and carefully grasp his arm, which was strong and full of magic, and the two walked away. She leaned on him with all her strength, but she was weak and powerless, truly like an old grandmother. He walked indifferently, not paying attention to her.

These two meetings, I saw almost every evening in the neighborhood. After these two pairs were perfectly matched, they disappeared into the crowd.

Because I am by nature inquisitive, I often continued to read these two love stories from the faces of the man in the gray coat and the woman with the blue ribbon—first tired, then ecstatic.

They both found companions, making life interesting, and completely obtained beautiful people as their incarnations. Although they were hideous and ugly, they actually found companions among many men and women who were more valuable than them, and it was completely successful.

But I often said that these two love poems would not have an ending. They were too fragile, because in each pair, one was unhealthy, making excessive demands on the other. Their poverty and supply were so great that they could not sustain them.

This was only a temporary situation. Fate made this sorrowful female worker obtain a handsome man with a beard, but made a flower-like woman paired with an unfortunate man whom she almost despised.

There was no doubt that this elegant gentleman was only receiving the admiration of an ardent and obedient heart for temporary convenience and benefit. He had many beautiful women in the world waiting for him. This young and pure woman, seeking love for the first time, was too impulsive, and in the future, she would abandon the person who begged her at the street corner every night and choose a better master.

These were the thoughts that arose in my heart after I gathered various accurate observations.

Ah! I guessed quite correctly, the result was very bad—as encountered in daily life, everything came towards disappointment, and like an unremarkable novel, it made people guess the whole thing from beginning to end. As a result, it soon came. One day, a few days after I left town, I was walking along the road as usual, but later than usual. The man in the gray coat was waiting alone. In another place, the woman with the blue ribbon on her head was also left there alone.

The next day, I still saw these two lonely people standing on the road, his eyes looking at the crowded people, searching for her, but she never came. Among the passersby hurrying for life, his shiny coat drooped down his shoulders, like a dead man, also like a criminal, his face covered with a layer of gray.

Her eyes no longer looked straight ahead, but looked at the ground in complete despair, staring at the flowing ditch water—a narrow muddy river like a big river, but not big enough to drown a person. I took a few steps back and saw her expressionless, incomplete profile. Her chest was as flat as a slate, and her wide mouth was thin and crooked.

Unconsciously, I stood between these two strangers who were suffering from open wounds.

I didn't know how to put aside this matter of waiting, nor did I know how to wait again. They each left the place they usually met. She retreated a few steps behind the kiosk, then turned and walked down the street. After retreating to the side of the road, he couldn't help but walk forward. I was very surprised that fate seemed to want to pull these two half-couples to the same place. On this desolate black stone road, they were destined to meet. Who could say that these two sorrowful people, with hearts of blood, would not get help after knowing each other? Who could say that these two people who had survived would not replace the two people who disappeared, those two beautiful people who were not suited to them? They did indeed walk closer. They raised their heads. They looked at each other. They immediately turned their heads back.

Alas! They actually recognized each other. At the same time, they also recognized their pitiful, unforgivable ugliness, the sin of their ugliness. I will never forget this mutual glance, because it was full of resentment and terrible curses!

### The Relationship Between Zhu Xi and Zhu Shuzhen

— Yang Ren

After Mr. Sun Yuehan's article "The Case of Ouyang Xiu and Zhu Shuzhen's Sheng Zha Zi" was published in this journal, there is no doubt that the phrase "meet after dusk" was indeed written by Zhu Shuzhen. However, Mr. Sun questioned the statement that "Zhu Shuzhen was Zhu Tao's niece," arguing that "Zhu Shuzhen was from Haining, Zhejiang, while Zhu Xi was from Xin'an, and there were no brothers who moved to Haining in the genealogy," hence believing it to be "somewhat inaccurate." As people from Haining, we are more interested in this issue. I would like to offer my shallow insights on the relationship between Zhu Xi and Zhu Shuzhen, based on what I know. First, let's cite some scattered records:

Haining County Chronicle, Literary and Artistic Records, Ladies' Category: "Zhu Shuzhen, niece of Duke Wen of the Hui State..."

Preface to the Collection of Brokenhearted Poems: "Shuzhen... married Wang Tangzuo of Lin'an..." Note that Lin'an is present-day Hangzhou County.

Dictionary Source: Zhu Xi, a native of Wuyuan, Song Dynasty (i.e., Xin'an), ...emigrated to Jianzhou...served under the four emperors Gao, Xiao, Guang, and Ning, accumulating official positions...died and was posthumously awarded the title of Scholar of the Baomo Pavilion, with the posthumous title of Wen, and posthumously conferred the title of Duke of the Hui State during the Shaoding period..."

From the surface of these scattered records, how could Zhu Shuzhen from Haining be the niece of Zhu Xi, who was originally from Anhui and later moved to Fujian? However, as long as we connect these points and observe them, we can see that it is not surprising that Zhu Shuzhen was Zhu Xi's niece, and it is, in fact, very certain.

Because present-day Hangzhou County was where the Southern Song Dynasty established its capital; and Zhu Xi was a high-ranking official of the Southern Song Dynasty (the Zhu Wengong Shrine is located next to the West Lake in Hangzhou) and an old minister who served under the four emperors Gao, Xiao, Guang, and Ning, accumulating important positions. Therefore, although he was originally from Anhui and later moved to Fujian, it was natural for him to bring his family to live in Hangzhou for a long time due to his "official service." Because he lived in Hangzhou for a long time, it was not only possible, but also very natural for his niece to marry Wang Tangzuo of Hangzhou. Later, the Wang family moved to Haining, and Zhu Shuzhen followed her husband. However, Zhu Shuzhen became famous for her poetry, and the county chronicle took "literary and artistic" records, so only Zhu Shuzhen's name was recorded, and not her husband's family. Therefore, it cannot be considered inaccurate that Zhu Shuzhen was Zhu Xi's niece just because Zhu's "genealogy does not include any brothers who moved to Haining." This is very clear in terms of both sentiment and reason.

We can also use other aspects such as environment and actions to provide circumstantial evidence that Zhu Shuzhen was Zhu Xi's niece:

For a woman like Zhu Shuzhen to have such deep literary attainments, it was not something that could be achieved by ordinary commoners. Although she was naturally talented, she probably would not have been able to do it without being born into a family of scholars of the Li School, receiving education and cultivation, and having a long history.

After Zhu Shuzhen died, her parents burned her poems and writings; this was a noteworthy and unusual action: In terms of the "hearts of parents all over the world," after the death of a biological daughter, there is no one who does not cherish her belongings; however, Zhu Shuzhen's parents did the opposite. This was obviously because they were "officials and famous families," and there were many "unrestrained" parts in her writings, which would tarnish the "family reputation"! Therefore, in a fit of anger, they disregarded the feelings of kinship and destroyed them.

Based on these various circumstances, it is not unreasonable and very consistent to say that Zhu Shuzhen was Zhu Xi's niece.

### Serenade Beyond the Border

— Ye Feng

Lonely Night

Just as the sun sets, the dim and desolate night comes pacing. The grassland is very silent: no wind, no stars in the sky. The wild grass falls asleep, and the village trembles in the cold and falls asleep... Everything seems to have fallen into a quiet valley, dreaming melancholy dreams.

Tonight, the grassland is very silent, and now no one is sitting on the riverbank singing. The affectionate river has fallen into deeper solitude.

Tonight, why has the grassland become so silent? The silence is a bit frightening. Where have those Gypsy singers on the grassland gone to play tonight? Why not leave us a harp and an accordion, so we can play too!

The night is very lonely, and our excited hearts are eager to play and sing a song!

Song

Do you like songs? Then let us play a "Grassland Symphony" for you! Almost everyone on our grassland is a wind and percussion musician, and there is a music concert outside our tents every night. On cold nights, we light a roaring bonfire, and many of us sit together blowing and singing... Our song is majestic and loud.

See, the singers of the people are coming out of the tents one by one, bringing their beloved strings to participate in our happy concert.

Tonight, why does the grassland seem so silent! The bonfire has gone out, and only an old man with a childlike face and white hair is sitting on the grass pile telling stories to the children. Go and ask him! The old man will tell you: Our singers have gone to a distant place to participate in a grand concert tonight.

Night Talk

It's almost midnight, but our singers haven't come back yet. Have they gone to visit the kingdom of the Horqin grassland again? The night is so cold! You should come back to the tent with us! Don't sit on the grass pile and daydream anymore.

Come back to the tent! We have lit a fire for you, so let's talk all night. The tent is very warm, and the old man is still going to tell you stories, tell some old stories from the grassland;

How the sun rises from the grassland, how the stars shine in the vast night sky, how the wind and sand whip the people on the grassland, and how those people live hard in the ice and snow...

Distant Thoughts

Do you feel comfortable sleeping on our grass bed? In your warm southern land where kapok grows, who else uses grass to lay on the bed to sleep!

Tonight, I see you lying on the grass bed, opening your bright eyes and looking at the dark sky outside the tent. It's midnight, and I see you tossing and turning, unable to fall asleep, and the night is so quiet, the silence makes you fall into a pool of loneliness. I know you miss your hometown a little. You stand up and go outside, look at the southern sky, lower your head and ponder for a long time before walking back again, and then there are glistening tears in your bitter eyes...

### An Inch of Mountains and Rivers, an Inch of Blood 73

— Ye Jingfeng

After Tiger Brother left with his men, I lingered for a few minutes at the temporary office set up by our commissioner in the pseudo-Public House and inspected it again. Then, I bid farewell to that commissioner, took my men to the car, and rushed to the pseudo-Autonomous Army Corps Headquarters, where originally there was "one squadron of the Security Force and one company of the 12th Regiment to handle the disarmament work." As the car drove along the road, I heard dense gunfire outside the city, knowing that the four battalions of the Security Force who had revolted and the brothers of the 12th Regiment who had revolted were fighting with the Japanese garrison outside the city. I felt very anxious and wished I could fly outside the city immediately to see what was going on.

When I arrived at the pseudo-Autonomous Army Corps Headquarters, I met a Security Force battalion commander from our village who had been ordered to be responsible for the disarmament. He told me that the disarmament work had not met with any resistance. The pseudo-garrison, with two numbers, the 7th and 14th, a total of more than five battalions, were willing to be reorganized immediately and rushed to the outside of the city to participate in the battle, but they requested to issue a month's military rations first, because before this, they had been deducted so much that they were almost starving to death. The commissioner we sent, the person in charge of assisting the disarmament work, had already agreed to the conditions, and now he had sent people to the three garrison battalions to check and inspect their guns, ammunition, and equipment.

After listening to the battalion commander's report, I went into the headquarters and talked to the commissioner for a few words, confirming that the battalion commander's report was correct. Only then did I immediately draft a report, sign it, and call a courier to send it to the headquarters. On the one hand, I wrote a note and told another courier to send it to Tiger Brother, also explaining verbally that if things went smoothly on that side, he should immediately return to the headquarters once.

Before my courier had gone for five minutes, just as I was preparing to leave for the headquarters, a courier from Tiger Brother rushed over, with a very nervous look on his face, handing over a note.

Opening the note, it was indeed in Tiger Brother's handwriting, with crooked writing on it: "Report, now investigating the bandit Yin Ergen, not truly dead, but feigning death, only I know the truth, the sons and daughters of the bandit said it very unclearly, saying that he is not in the mansion nine out of ten days, but in Shuanglongzhanzhai. Cui Jie knows the place of Shuanglongzhanzhai, and I know it too. Comrades unwilling to cooperate, heart ruthless. I am now secretly, and not telling them. Thousand ten thousand. Urgent urgent. Captain can quickly come to Cui Jie's place, must be able to meet once, after ten o'clock, I will go alone. The matter of disguise has all been done. ... Xiao Hucheng standing at attention."

This note was simply written like a special code, with many misspelled words and incomprehensible sentences. Except for me, I am afraid no one could understand it. I read it repeatedly twice before I understood a few key points: 1. Roughly, the comrades who went to arrest the Yin rebel mistakenly identified someone else as the true body of the Yin rebel and shot him dead. Tiger Brother recognized that it was not the true body of the rebel. 2. Tiger Brother traced the fact that the Yin rebel was hiding in Shuanglongqian nine out of ten days from the family of the Yin rebel, which is the "Devil's Cave" that Sister Cui's mother and daughter were talking about. 3. The comrades were probably a little jealous of Tiger Brother, so he also hid the matter of Shuanglongqian and asked me to keep it a secret. 4. He asked me to go adventuring with him and had prepared disguises; before ten o'clock, we would meet at Sister Cui's place.

In order to understand the situation that Tiger Brother had gone through in the Yin rebel's house, I questioned the courier a few more times. I learned that the guards of the rebel's house were mixed with many Japanese and Korean sticks, and the resistance was very fierce. It was still Tiger Brother who led two subordinates and found more than a dozen acquaintances from the Security Force, climbed over the wall from the backyard, set a fire, and attacked from the inside, attacking from both sides, before solving the guards and dead soldiers. It is said that the commissioner in charge of besieging the rebel's house and arresting the rebel culprit had originally intended to capture the rebel leader alive, but he did not expect that the rebel leader "Yin Rugen" would also shoot, and his shooting skills were very good. Several of our comrades sacrificed under his gun. According to the courier's own eyes, the Yin rebel was shot dead by Tiger Brother with one shot. If you want to prove it, you can check the fatal wound of the rebel's corpse. The wound was a revolver bullet, and only Tiger Brother was using a revolver on the spot, the rest were box cannons, German-style ten-shot pistols, etc.

### The Yu Case

— Shao Fu

The two-way embezzlement case was sentenced yesterday. Zhang Hongtu and Yu Xiangyan were each sentenced to 15 years in prison. The lightest of the merchants, such as Jin Yunting and Cao Zuxin, were also sentenced to three years and six months in prison. The articles cited were all based on Article 3, Section 6 of the Regulations on Punishing Corruption. We are laymen in law, but considering the circumstances and reasoning, we always feel that this judgment is worth studying.

First, commissions in China today have almost become an open secret. May I ask which agency's procurement does not have a bit of "oil and water"? Many, though not directly taking money, resort to disguised gifts, such as accepting valuable gifts, which is no different from accepting bribes and corruption. Moreover, merchants are in a passive position. If the person handling the matter does not indicate, the merchant would never dare to offer a bribe.

Second, such a large embezzlement case at the Lianglu Bureau's Materials Department lasted for several months. Can the supervisor be completely unaware of the subordinate's crime? Should the court conduct a thorough investigation? Leaving aside the legal issues, should the administrative supervisor bear the blame for negligence? These are all questions we are eager to find answers to.

Corruption is rampant, and bribery is open. Severe sentencing originally has profound meaning. If one only sees the firewood and not the forest, it is abandoning the major for the minor. If one only blocks the flow without stopping the source, it seems not thorough enough.

### Launching a General Attack Order Against Rats Worldwide

— Yu Qiang

Dr. Curt Panl Richter of the Phipps Psychiatric Clinic at Johns Hopkins Hospital studies rodents. One morning in 1941, he found six dead rats in his laboratory. Each had eaten a small amount of a chemical, phenylthiourea, that was considered harmless. This chemical had been tried by thousands of people without harming them. However, phenylthiourea clearly killed those rats. Dr. Richter couldn't figure out how that was possible. Thus, his rat reduction campaign began, and the war was on.

Phenylthiourea is known as the bitterest substance. There is a strange thing about it: some people, about three out of ten, cannot taste it at all. This trait runs in families. Richter wondered if this peculiar difference also existed in rats. So, he placed crystals of phenylthiourea on the tongues of the rats in his lab. None of the rats seemed to find it "unpalatable." And then they all died.

Richter mixed phenylthiourea in the drinking water for other rats. They drank it as quickly as ordinary water. As a result, they all died. And they died not like they had eaten other poisons, but as if suffering from severe pleurisy. Their chests and lungs filled with water, as if they had drowned.

After years of research, it is known that rats have a mysterious instinct to avoid eating tainted or poisonous food. But phenylthiourea seems to be an exception to this rule.

However, the fertility of the rats living in captivity in Richter's lab gradually decreased. Would their wild cousins be so easily fooled? Richter caught several live rats from the garbage dump, but they wouldn't touch food or water containing lethal amounts of phenylthiourea.

Faced with this situation, most people would give up the research. But Richter knew that phenylthiourea was part of a large chemical family. From E.I. du Pont de Nemours Company, he obtained more than two hundred different thiourea compounds. One of them proved to kill wild rats as phenylthiourea killed domesticated rats. The label on the bottle read: Alpha-naparhyl-thiourea. Richter shortened and combined the first letters of each word and named it "ANTU."

This chemical is very cheap, costing only four dollars per pound in the United States. Richter found that only one part in two hundred thousand pounds of "ANTU" could kill the strongest rat. Enthusiastic about Richter's report, Washington funded him to continue his research.

At the time, the most potent rat poison was zinc sulfate. Richter's research showed that "ANTU" was twice as effective as zinc sulfate.

Thus, the real experiment began. Could a rat poison that performed extraordinarily well in the lab be just as effective outdoors? Because the locals hated the rampant rats and desperately needed something to drastically exterminate them, Richter had no difficulty finding helpers.

The rat exterminators, all volunteers, were divided into several teams. Each team was in charge of an area, and at least one person was recruited to help in each building. The teams distributed the poisoned bait one afternoon and made more detailed calculations the next day. In one area, one hundred dead rats were found the next morning.

Richter knew that rats have a habit of keeping their bodies clean. He came up with a clever way to spread the poison, which was to fill a sprayer with "ANTU" and spray it into the rat holes. When a rat discovers that its fur or paws are stuck with foreign objects, it will lick it off with its tongue, and thus meet its demise.

The results of this method applied in Jinan, within twelve months, collected 156,210 dead rats, and the exterminators believed that the number of rats truly poisoned was three times larger than this number.

With "ANTU," the mischief of rats can be greatly reduced.

From now on, a general attack order is issued against rats worldwide.

### I am a Poor Man - Casual Notes

— Jiang

I am a poor man.

Poor people have no joy; this is an unchanging truth.

But my poverty is not to the point of lacking clothing or food. I have simple clothes, simple meals, a wife who doesn't complain, and children who don't wail. But my income is always used up within the year, with no savings, no support, relying only on the mercy of heaven to grant me a healthy body. Since entering the world, I have never groaned in bed for eight or ten days. Occasionally, when I feel slightly unwell, I don't bother the "doctor" or "herbalist" and can recover without medicine. I am like this, and so are my wife, children, and elders. Although I have lived for more than half a century, my future support is still vague, but I already feel "uniquely blessed"!

I am a poor man, a poor man with no savings, no support. Every year, every day, I just "do what I should do," earning a few rewards for my efforts to support my family. The rewards I get can be called "not ashamed of heaven above," "not ashamed of people below." My heart is never uneasy for a single day. I don't "live in constant fear," I don't "suck up to the powerful," I "live within my means," and I "avoid socializing" Because of my solitary nature, those with lofty ideals call me a "saint," while those engrossed in worldly matters cannot help but see me as "unrelenting." As for me? I go my own way.

Since entering the world, I don't know what "banquets" are, I don't know what "enjoyment" tastes like. When I eat a bowl of fresh fish soup, I know it is "supremely fresh." When I wear a new garment made of old cloth, I know it is "clean." Other than that, I am just "someone who has not attained," and I dare not taste anything further.

I was like this in my hometown, and I am like this after fleeing to Shanghai. Shanghai is indeed much more lively than my hometown, but I don't find it lively. I only find it noisy. If I were not forced by adverse circumstances, I really wouldn't want to live here for a single day.

Recently, for the past year, I have still been doing what I should do every day, earning a few rewards for my mental and physical labor to support my family. The rewards I get are still, like in my hometown, "not ashamed of heaven above," "not ashamed of people below." My heart is never uneasy for a single day. I don't "live in constant fear," I don't "suck up to the powerful," I [missing text]. I still maintain my consistent style.

But, Shanghai is, after all, a new environment in my life history. I cannot let down this place, known throughout the world. At the same time, I cannot be like "an old monk in meditation for nine years." In my spare time, I have also wandered around a bit. But the "chaos" on the streets makes me a little dizzy. The speeding trams, the dashing cars, the rickshaws, and the pedicabs jostling around, coupled with the shops on both sides of the street doing their best to attract customers - I am used to strolling. This is simply depriving me of my rights, so I vowed not to take the first wander again. However, I feel that my life is too monotonous. Fortunately, I have a like-minded friend, also a refugee, who kindly gave me a long-term park entrance ticket. This allows me to visit any park. On weekends, I use the park to adjust my monotonous life. Every holiday, I bring two of my favorite books and buy a few packs of basic cigarettes. This is my extra expense for visiting the park. Normally, the cigarettes I smoke are from cans. In a crowded place, I feel it is not elegant. So, on this day of visiting the park, my greatest pleasure is "slowly puffing" and "leisurely enjoying" my poor man's joy.

The park is too memorable, especially "Hongkou"s "Zhongzheng Park." Entering the gate, there is a green lawn, refreshing the eyes. The red-purple little flowers do not carry any wealth or ostentatious arrogance. Standing briefly on the short bridge, I forget all honor and disgrace. The lotus leaves stand tall, further inspiring artistic intent.

I am a poor man, but I have not changed my joy. If you say this is old-fashioned, I am willing to accept it.

Wonderful News from Abroad

### Reasons for Divorce

— Chen Zhongsheng

"A married person committing adultery" is explicitly punishable under our country's criminal law. As for unmarried people committing adultery, although the law does not punish them, it is morally condemned as shameless and lacking in integrity. Therefore, although people may engage in adultery in reality, they generally try to cover it up to avoid criticism from others. However, this is not the case in New York State in the United States. Some people are inherently careful in their behavior, with no impropriety whatsoever, but are willing to say that they have indeed committed adultery.

It turns out that the divorce laws in the various states of the United States are not as free as rumored. For example, Chinese law allows spouses to divorce by agreement, but no state in the United States allows parties to divorce by agreement. Instead, each state's law lists the reasons for which a divorce can be granted. Only those with such reasons can request a court to order a divorce. The law of New York State makes adultery the only reason for divorce. Thus, false adultery is produced.

Sometimes, couples agree to divorce and go their separate ways because they are incompatible. But since the law does not allow divorce by agreement, and judicial divorce is limited to adultery, the unhappy couples in New York, after agreeing to divorce, have to invert the cause and effect, performing false adultery to achieve the purpose of divorce in order to obtain legal effect.

### Confidence

— Xu Ying, translated from "Newsweek"

A satirical joke has been circulating in Germany recently. It is said that a French journalist visited a famous American atomic bomb expert during the Paris Peace Conference and asked, "How many atomic bombs does the United States need to destroy France?" The atomic scientist then asked a long list of questions, such as how many large cities there are in France, how many hydroelectric power plants there are, and so on. After consulting these materials, he calculated a large number of very complicated calculations on a piece of paper. Finally, he replied, "A total of one hundred and thirty-two are needed."

The Frenchmen immediately looked crestfallen. Then, he asked, "Well, how many atomic bombs are needed to destroy Belgium?" The American listened and calculated in a serious manner, saying, "Forty-three." The French journalist finally asked, "Well, how many atomic bombs are needed to destroy the Soviet Union?" The American atomic bomb expert immediately put the piece of paper into his pocket and replied immediately, "One thousand two hundred and sixty-nine."

Precisely: having confidence, there is no need to consider. Humanity is thus prepared to destroy itself.

### Group Suicide of the Japanese Army - Historical Facts of the War

— Lu Shixiong

The barbarity and cruelty of the Japanese army are universally despised, but their spirit of loyalty to the country and self-sacrifice is truly astonishing. The following is a recollection of a tragic and moving scene of "group suicide" after the Japanese army suffered a disastrous defeat in the Philippines.

The U.S. forces found enemy documents on Luzon Island. This document was an order from Japanese warlords forcing more than 80,000 injured soldiers of the Japanese army fighting in the Philippines to carry out the death penalty or suicide. Many of the executed Japanese soldiers were mostly injured in the most intense battle in Manila. The following is a translation of the contents of the order issued by the former Japanese Central Command in Manila:

"In each unit, all those who are injured, sick, or unable to engage in combat behavior shall take two days' rations, gather at the corner of the fortress, and prepare to commit collective suicide on or around the 21st (month unknown). The commander of each unit shall assign a person in charge to supervise the death. Before the suicide, they are allowed one day and one night of free thought, so that each person can fully consider their decision to happily sacrifice for the country."

The document also pointed out that killing the wounded often complied with the order to charge with "Banzai" (Japanese army slogan when charging).

Another similar document from the former Japanese commander in Manila was also found, the gist of which is as follows:

"Before the general attack, all those who have been injured should commit suicide and destroy all documents and sundries. In the general attack, they must gloriously sacrifice themselves and not be captured. If injured, they should be urged to commit suicide by their comrades."

A captured Japanese naval officer said that his commander had told him, "The situation is hopeless. Go tell the wounded in the hospital to prepare for a glorious death." This officer had accepted the request of two of his subordinates and stabbed them to death with a sword. Those who did not want to commit suicide would also be killed. Their military hospital was set up underground, and each ward was blown up, and all the people in the hospital were buried alive underground.

The above tragedy can be described as shocking heaven and earth and moving ghosts and gods. We think calmly, and their spirit of loyalty, courage, and self-sacrifice is indeed extraordinarily tough. It is a pity that such barbarically ingrained fanaticism is of no help to the country!

When Mr. Johnston, President of the American Chamber of Commerce, toured the Soviet Union in 1944, he gave a public speech. When he mentioned the American Communist Party, he said, "When the Soviet Union eats pepper, they (referring to the American Communists) sneeze; when the Soviet Union has indigestion, they burp."

### Weekend Chat

— Liu Sui

There was a comment in the English-language *Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury* last week saying that, according to historical records, the modern Chinese × army has never won a battle, but there are many interesting things that should be recorded in permanent records. These so-called interesting things are actually the most uninteresting to us. They pointed out in detail how Chinese × army × ships of such-and-such numbers were "trying to smuggle." The Asian Society's Qiongyai correspondence even wrote about the fact that large quantities of enemy and puppet materials received were stolen and transported out by these ships. A United Press Guangzhou dispatch even described the "× army" and "pirates" in a confusing manner, making people dizzy. However, the result was a note saying, "These ships originally belonged to the Chinese × army, but whether they were plundered by pirates or voluntarily became pirates has not been determined." Fortunately, there is such a sentence, and our "concern for the country" has been greatly stabilized. Despite the undeniable and unconvincing old traces of "never having won a battle," we still hope that this "uninteresting" matter can be "found to be inaccurate" in the future, or that some facts can be used to show that our × army is really "working hard for the public" or "being plundered by pirates," so as not to be left with some records of "interesting things" "according to historical records" by others in the next decade!

According to customs statistics, from January to August of this year, the total value of milk powder, biscuits, sugar, coffee, etc. imported into China from various countries was 14,954,827,000 yuan; the total value of tea, crude tea, brick tea, etc. exported from our country to various countries was 2,041,421,000 yuan. This item alone has an import surplus that is more than seven times the export value; in addition, the total value of cigarettes, cigars, cigarette paper, etc. imported from various countries into China was 17,761,914,000 yuan, and the total value of tobacco and tobacco leaves exported from our country to foreign countries was only 1,397,807,000 yuan, which is slightly less than one-fourteenth of the import value. This number is exactly double the import surplus of food; we cannot bear to write down the import surplus figures of other tonics and luxury goods. This cannot but remind people of the glass leather bags in the domestic goods market and the foreign language trademarks on domestic goods. One can understand what the so-called "promotion of domestic goods" is all about. I remember more than ten years ago, during the boycott of Japanese goods movement, many shops selling Japanese goods said after being smashed to pieces, "We are not crazy; the things of others are cheap and good, and we only know how to do business with low cost and high profit!" The words are still in my ears. Comparing them with the current situation where many "American goods vendors" are still furtively shrinking in small alleys to solicit customers, I really don't know if this is the tragic fate of our China?

"Yu Meiren"

According to Nanjing newspapers: a certain institution recently received a winter clothing fee from above. In addition to using part of it to make a set of uniforms for all employees, regarding the overcoat part, the general affairs personnel were approved to purchase the military overcoats left by the Japanese army that had been auctioned and dyed before distributing them. Each piece was discounted at 200,000 yuan. Unexpectedly, all the employees had long been looking forward to new cotton for warmth, so how could they be willing to buy these old clothes? Therefore, they asked a section chief to lead the signing of a request to stop the purchase and dyeing and issue the money to allow everyone to buy new clothes. When the news reached the ears of the general affairs personnel, they immediately flew into a rage and ran to the section chief to start talking officialese: "This was approved by ×, what reason do you have to object?" It is said that the employees have not yet complied. If this is true, I would like to advise those employees. Let's look at the lyrics as proof ("Yu Meiren"): When will the private gain and oiling end? All green banknotes are few! How can dyeing overcoats block the wind? The abacus is in the belly of the general affairs personnel; Although the request is submitted, the approval is said to be not allowed to change; From the outset, the handler must take a cut, cold point calculated, why bother to make enemies!

Beware of Bombs

News came that the Xiang-Gan-E inspection group in Wuhan actually received a "housewarming" gift, which was an "urgent warning" from the "receiving colleagues" asking the group leader, Mr. Qiu, to "know what's good for him." There were many wonderful sentences in the ultimatum, the most wonderful of which was of course the reminder to the imperial envoys to "stop the inspection work at the appropriate time" because "What's the use of worrying about things that don't concern you?" So the conclusion was "If you don't get out of here, beware of bombs." Some people say that this letter is simply the tone of a robber, but I don't think it needs to be taken so seriously; may I ask if there are not many robber mentalities in the current society? How could a dignified receiving responsibility forget the principle of "never being poor when handling"? The inspection personnel are at least considered by the receiving officials to be "afraid of him because they don't have an imperial sword," so if they want to handle official business fairly, that is really asking for trouble. It is said that the group handled this incident very properly, because they have decided that "This letter can be used as a work report to the Central Government by the members of this group." The clouds and mist will naturally dissipate soon, but we common people always feel a bit of "My ambition has not been fulfilled, and people are also suffering, there are tears everywhere in the southeast!"
